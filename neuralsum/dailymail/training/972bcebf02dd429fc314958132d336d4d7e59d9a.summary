' at school she was called " mrs @entity60 " because she talked so much , she even got given lines to write : " i must not talk in class			0
" ' ' there were a few families that went into hiding and fortunately quite a few survived			0

my mother took @entity3 to lectures , cooked him meals , they started to depend on each other			2
' after my mother married @entity3 i started to be introduced as @entity5 's stepsister			1
i thought : i am still a person , i have a name and i lived through the same things she did			0
it was a difficult time ... to see my mother so happy too when i had adored my father			2
' i eventually accepted it , i thought i have a life , i have a family , i have children and @entity5 has nothing			2
' @entity1 showed hosts @entity90 and @entity91 the forearm tattoo that she was branded with as a child of @entity15 hidden world : like the @entity76 , @entity1 's family spent several years being hidden from @entity11 soldiers until they were betrayed by a @entity73 nurse and arrested @entity5 's diary was discovered in the house in @entity9 where the @entity7 spent two years hiding during @entity156 as well as her appearance on @entity158 was interviewed on @entity161 's @entity160 show , where she told host @entity162 : ' the experience has faded in a way , because i have talked about it a lot			1
it is always with me but it 's not so painful anymore			0
