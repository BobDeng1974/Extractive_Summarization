@entity31 , a picture of the torched car mr @entity7 helped save but it was n't long before he was called into the store director 's office where he was told he was being put on suspension			1
' the one supervisor told me that my heart was in the right place , but my brain was n't ' mr @entity7 told @entity43			2
mr @entity7 was officially fired later that week for ' not following company policy '			1
' i thought that was what we were supposed to do			0
you know , you have somebody that is in need , do n't you help them ? but i guess not , ' mr @entity7 said			2
mr @entity7 admits that he was put on suspension once before - for chasing a shoplifter out of the store			1
since he was let go , mr @entity7 has been unable to find another job			2
unemployed : mr @entity7 has n't been able to find another job since getting fired from @entity22 responding to criticism that mr @entity7 should n't have been fired , the company issued a statement to @entity62 , saying it ' was not a random decision '			1
' we have well - established safety procedures for emergency situations and we train all team members on those procedures			0
these procedures help ensure the safety of everyone – both customers and team members , and our team members know there are consequences when they do n’t follow them			0
' one customer especially peeved about mr @entity80 's termination is the shopper he helped that day , @entity78			2
he says his car would have completely burned out if mr @entity7 did n't come to his aid			1
' i just think it 's ridiculous			0
why should you be penalized for being a @entity87 ? ' @entity78 asked			0
and now the situation is turning into a pr nightmare for the company , as patrons have been posting on the store 's @entity93 page in protest and calling for mr @entity7 to get his job back			1
thankful : customer @entity78 says his car would have been lost if mr @entity7 had n't helped him put out the fire ' last night i pulled into your @entity22 's parking lot to do my weekly shopping			1
i thought about how @entity7 was always there to greet me and my 4 - year - old and cheer her on while she played the claw game at your entrance , ' wrote @entity106			2
' although i shop there almost exclusively , i reconsidered my decision to support your store and drove to @entity110			0
i hope that you will reconsider your decision in the firing of a @entity87			0
' patron @entity113 said he read about the story in the local paper and questions how the store 's founder , the late @entity117 , would have dealt with the same situation			0
' it tells me not to ever get hit by a car or have a heart attack in their parking lot			0
it would evidently be against company policy to get any help from a employee			0
@entity22 should be ashamed for not wanting to have their staff help out in those type of situation ... he should get his job back , ' mr @entity113 wrote .			2

@entity7 was a store greeter at a @entity22 in @entity2 , @entity3
a customer came into the store last month asking for help with a fire that broke out in his car
mr @entity7 grabbed an extinguisher and left his position to help the customer put it out and soon returned to his post
the store director later fired mr @entity7 for not following the company 's emergency *protocols* which *dictated* he should n't leave his position
the firing of mr @entity7 has led @entity22 *regulars* to protest the store
