it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			2
there 's a @entity5 who used to have an orange glow and is now burning bright on the south coast plus a tennis legend , a £ 25million @entity9 hot - shot and a couple of familiar faces who are never short of something to say			2
what 's hot @entity15 the @entity17 manager is not a stranger to winning			1
if you spent enough time hanging around the first team at @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 in the 80s and 90s then the chances are you wo n't have wasted your time and @entity15 's cv contains two @entity30 triumphs , a clutch of @entity33 trophies and a @entity35 win from 1988			1
at the age of 51 , though , @entity15 is midway towards what would perhaps be one of his greatest achievements			1
@entity15 ( centre ) has @entity17 looking comfortable in the @entity30 places @entity42 ( no 11 ) was the hero for @entity15 's side last week as he scored to sink top - four rivals @entity44 the @entity5 was already a @entity30 winner with @entity46 when he scored the only goal for @entity24 - a typical @entity15 free - kick - against @entity49 under the @entity50 at @entity51 in 1992 he was celebrating then and he 's still celebrating now ... @entity17 boss @entity15 knows how to win when his @entity17 team started the season like a train , we presumed they would prove to be nothing more than pleasant diversion from the norm			1
here we are heading towards february , though , and last weekend 's win at @entity44 has seen @entity15 's team ease in to third place in the @entity9			1
@entity17 in the @entity30 ? @entity15 's record would perhaps suggest that is where he belongs			1
@entity65 if you want to know the toll a life on the professional tennis circuit takes on the mind and body then consider the fact that @entity72 has been selling underpants for the last two decades			1
the worshipped @entity75 baseliner may not be typical but the fact he retired at the age of 26 tells you something about how hard it is to extend a career at the top of the men 's game year after year			1
you 're never too old for a bit of showboating as @entity65 practises ahead of the @entity88 his game has n't changed much but he 's ditched the hairdo he had when he won his first @entity91 in 2003 @entity92 - who did as much as anyone to hurry @entity72 in to retirement - kept his career going until he was 32 but the fact his singles ranking had dropped to 20 by the time he took his racket home suggests he had carried on a little too long			1
@entity101 at 30 , @entity102 at 31			2
so what do we make of @entity65 's remarkable longevity in the week that he racked up his 1,000th victory ? @entity65 is second - favourite - behind @entity107 - to win the season 's first grand slam in @entity111 @entity65 will be approaching his 34th birthday by the time this summer 's @entity91 rolls round but , ranked two in the world and second - favourite for the forthcoming @entity88 , is showing no signs of slowing down			1
maybe a clue to it all is buried in the stats			2
of the 1000 wins on tour , only 22 have ever gone to five sets			2
maybe it 's just been too easy all these years			2
@entity125 it may seem a little odd to shine a positive light on the @entity9 champions in the week that they were shown to have bungled their way to a succession of untruths regarding the status of @entity133			1
certainly , their @entity135 department have had better weeks			2
@entity136 will return from the @entity137 as a @entity125 player after his £ 25m move @entity140 ( left ) and @entity141 have just head that @entity125 have snapped up a 20 - goals - a - year striker nevertheless , all that will really matter to @entity146 and the club 's fans are prospects on the field and it may be that the signing of striker @entity136 this week has changed the landscape of the domestic season significantly			1
for all @entity157 's formidable power , it is hard to escape the feeling they rely rather too heavily on the prolific @entity160 for goals and momentum			0
if they lose him to injury , we may see a different @entity157			0
@entity125 , though , now have four of 2014 's top five @entity9 goal scorers in their ranks and if that is n't a fact to serve notice of their ongoing financial might - whatever the calculators of @entity177 officials may say - then i do n't know what is			1
@entity136 , or @entity136 , either way his name was on a @entity9 scoresheet 20 times in 2014 what 's not @entity183 while discussing his team ’s troubles in the @entity9 so far this season , @entity184 suggested it was time for the players to : ‘ show some b * * * * * * s ’			1
while such basic urgings do little to further @entity184 ’s claims to be one of our national sport ’s great thinkers , they also miss the point rather			0
@entity184 and @entity183 have lost every @entity9 game they 've played away from home this season @entity183 ’s issues at the foot of the league – they have lost all of their 10 away games so far – have little to do with their courage , motivation or determination and more with the fact that they just are n’t good enough			1
last season in the @entity35 , @entity212 ’s squad was bursting with extremely well - paid household names – many of whom had @entity9 experience – yet they still managed to finish fourth , 13 points behind @entity219 , in second , and a staggering 22 behind winners @entity222			0
that , really , should have told us all we needed to know			0
average teams do n’t become good teams overnight , no matter how big their ‘ b * * * * * * s ’ are			1
@entity228 the @entity230 chairman and owner has ploughed enough of his own money in to his football club to have earned the right to say whatever he likes when things do n’t go the way of @entity238 ’s team down in @entity239 mid-table			0
however , the 38 - year - old may wish to ponder whether his latest @entity243 rantings at his failing players are likely to have any effect			0
@entity228 launched a scathing @entity243 attack ... and if you want to read it , just look below here is the list of the 14 tweets from disgruntled @entity230 chairman @entity228 on saturday any @entity252 charge that follows his 11 - tweet outburst wo n’t bother him but it ’s hard to escape the feeling that his players perhaps wo n’t respond in the way he wishes them to			2
you only have to go back to november 22 for the previous time he took @entity238 ’s team to task on @entity243 – after a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity267 – and the response to that was a run of results that currently reads @entity271			0
the problem with the ‘ shock ’ tactic is that you only really have one shot at it			0
if it does n’t work and you keep on ranting , you look less like the master motivator and more like the nutter in the corner			0
@entity281 @entity283 ’s wonderful ‘ @entity284 ’ competition presented us with the chance to witness a riveting 20 - minute exchange between @entity288 and @entity281 as they shared a commentary box in @entity111 on tuesday morning			0
the first thing we learned is that @entity288 may have a future as an interviewer , the former @entity283 captain proving as determined and unforgiving with the microphone as he did with a bat over his two - decade career			0
as far as an @entity300 recall is concerned , it 's time for @entity281 to let it go the second is that @entity281 can be diplomatic when he tries			0
pushed by @entity288 to name players in the @entity300 set - up with bigger egos than his own , @entity281 declined			0
when the subject of @entity308 was raised , meanwhile , he described him as a ' lovely guy '			0
sadly , though , @entity281 will continue to lose admirers as long as he continues to talk dreamily about a return to the @entity300 side			2
the former @entity300 skipper may or may not be right when he says there are many who want to see him back in the set - up but there are certainly many who do n’t and that – sadly for him – would appear to include the selectors			0
time for him to let it go before it gets embarrassing .			0

@entity30 king @entity15 may have another crack at the big one
his @entity17 side are comfortable in the @entity30 places
@entity65 is still going strong at the grand old age of ... 33
@entity125 have never been *slicker* now @entity136 has *joined* the ranks
@entity183 just are n't good enough
