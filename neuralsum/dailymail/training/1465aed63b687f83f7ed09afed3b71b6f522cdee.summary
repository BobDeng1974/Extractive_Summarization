these incredible images show the craggy mountainside where @entity7 , @entity9 ’s £ 1.6billion planetary explorer , hopes to discover signs that life once existed on @entity12			1
the six - wheeled rover , which landed earlier this month , will edge its way to the foot of the mountain , 6.2 miles away , to scratch around in the dirt , dust and soil			1
@entity9 officials said it placed @entity7 directly over a patch where one of the spacecraft ’s landing engines scoured away a few inches of gravelly soil and exposed underlying rock			2
researchers plan to use a neutron - shooting instrument on the rover to check for water molecules bound into minerals at this partially excavated target , they said			2
chemical analysis of those samples should reveal whether @entity12 ever had the organic materials that could support life and may help answer one of the greatest questions of science : is life unique to @entity54 or did it once exist elsewhere in the @entity55 ? science fiction writers have speculated about intelligent @entity57 since @entity59 times			1
however , scientists now suspect that the @entity12 is dead – but that it may once have been home to alien bacteria or moss			2
bugs and moss might not sound like intelligent little green men , but their one - time presence would mean that life has evolved – or been deposited by comets or asteroids – on two of the eight planets of our @entity55			2
and if life is relatively common in our small corner of the galaxy , then surely the universe must be teeming with it			0
the latest images are the most detailed yet from the nuclear - powered @entity7 , which landed in the @entity81 , south of @entity12 ’s equator			1
they show layers of rocks – similar to the red and grey tiers of the @entity88 in @entity89 in the @entity90 – near the base of the three - mile - high @entity24 at the centre of the 96 - mile - wide crater			1
the colour of one of the images – taken by @entity7 ’s 100mm telephoto camera , one of 17 on board – is enhanced to show the scene under the same lighting conditions here on @entity54 , which helps scientists to analyse the terrain			0
previous surveys of @entity12 have shown the layers contain clays and other minerals that usually form in the presence of water			1
although @entity12 is now a desert planet , millions of years ago its surface was carved by oceans , lakes and waterfalls			1
the gravelly land in the foreground of the main picture is the landing area , named @entity120 in tribute to the @entity90 science fiction writer , @entity122 , who died in june			0
the ground eventually rises up to the edge of a crater , behind which lies a field of darker dunes leading up to the bottom of @entity24			0
@entity131 camera : this image , taken by the @entity133 , highlights the geology of @entity24 , a mountain inside @entity81 , where the rover landed @entity12 surface : the @entity139 data now reveal a strong discontinuity in the strata above and below the line of white dots @entity9 administrator @entity144 also had a recorded speech played from the rover on the surface of @entity12			1
he said : ' the knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of @entity81 will tell us much about the possibility of life on @entity12 as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet			1
' @entity7 will bring benefits to @entity54 and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers , as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future			0
' the peak of the mountain is ten miles away			0
what has intrigued @entity9 about these pictures is the peculiar nature of the layers of rock on the @entity170 those near the crater floor are horizontal , the ones higher up have been twisted by geological forces over millions of years and are sharply inclined – exactly the reverse of similar features found on @entity54			1
in the @entity88 , for instance , the rock layers near the bottom have been buckled and tilted by the movement of the @entity54 ’s tectonic plates			2
but the more recent layers on top are horizontal			0
the difference on @entity12 suggests layers of rock were deposited quickly by violent winds or currents			2
as well as the surprising tilt of the @entity12 rocks , their composition has intrigued scientists who plan to use the rover ’s array of gadgets to seek out signs of past , or current , life in the layers of rock			1
among these are the @entity197 , which uses a laser to vaporise soil and rock samples before analysing their chemical make - up			0
however , anyone hoping for a quick answer to the question of life will be disappointed			0
for the rover will take nearly a year to trundle over to the mountainside			0
eventually , @entity9 wants to send a manned mission and its publicity machine is eager to whip up enthusiasm for all things @entity12			1
that explains why yesterday , at 9pm , the space agency was preparing to broadcast a new track by @entity217 singer @entity216 from the rover			0
it was – @entity9 informed the world – the first time a pop song has been broadcast on another planet			2
what any hiding @entity57 will think , heaven knows			0
let ’s just hope they do n’t mistake it for a declaration of war			0
@entity9 also released a new colour panorama showing a 360 - degree view of @entity7 's landing site , including the highest part of @entity24 visible to the rover this image taken by a front camera on @entity9 's @entity7 shows track marks from the rover 's two @entity12 drives track marks from a successful drive to the scour mark known as @entity242 , an area of bedrock exposed by thrusters on the rover 's descent stage			1

it is then relayed back to the team in the @entity268 ...			0
