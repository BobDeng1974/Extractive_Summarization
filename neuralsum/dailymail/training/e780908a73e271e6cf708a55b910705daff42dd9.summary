by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter president @entity3 and @entity4 have paid $ 98,169 in taxes on their $ 481,098 income for the 2013 fiscal year , according to tax returns the @entity10 released friday			1
they paid an effective federal income tax rate of 20.4 per cent			1
the couple 's 2013 federal income tax return was posted on the @entity10 website four days before the tax filing deadline			0
low point : in 2013 , president @entity3 had the lowest total income that he has had in the past three years since his book sales dropped down to less than half of what they were in 2012 @entity24 notes that sales of the president 's book dropped from $ 258,722 in 2012 down to $ 104,000 this past year			1
by comparison , the @entity28 reported income of $ 662,076 and paid $ 112,214 in federal taxes at a rate of 18.4 percent for 2012			1
avoiding the bump : @entity3 , seen here on friday in @entity35 , did not have to pay the ' millionaire tax ' he implemented because his income was far under the cut off in 2011 , they earned $ 844,585 while paying $ 162,074 in federal taxes			1
after deductions , the couple 's adjusted gross income was $ 608,611 in 2012 and $ 789,674 in 2011			2
@entity3 's annual presidential salary is $ 400,000			2
he had planned to return 5 percent of his pay in 2013 as a gesture of solidarity with federal government workers who faced unpaid leave amid deep spending cuts			0
@entity3 reported $ 394,796 in 2013 wages , and it was not immediately clear if or how he returned any portion of those earnings			0
because his overall taxable income this year came in at $ 333,329 that keeps him well below the $ 450,000 mark where individuals begin being taxed at the raised 39.6 per cent rate that the president boosted in the ' millionaire 's tax ' that his administration put into effect not long ago			1
the 42 - page document shows the @entity28 reported donating $ 59,251 to 32 charities which equates to 12.3 per cent of their adjusted gross income			2
that figure is $ 90,000 less than the couple donated to charity last year , which may be a result of his falling book sales			1
their largest charitable gift , $ 8,751 , went to the @entity76 , which supports military families			0
among the @entity28 ' other notable charitable contributions were $ 5,000 to the @entity79 , the exclusive private school where daughters @entity28 and @entity81 are enrolled , $ 4,000 to the @entity82 and $ 2,000 to one fund @entity83 , which was created last year to aid victims of the @entity86 bombings			0
the @entity28 also released their @entity88 income tax return showing they paid $ 23,328 in income taxes to their home state			2
separately , vice president @entity92 and his wife @entity93 paid $ 96,378 in federal tax last year on adjusted gross income of $ 407,009			0
giving back : the @entity28 gave less to charity this year than previous years since their giving rate has always been reflective of their annual income , but they gave the most to the @entity76 which supports military families ( @entity4 seen at one of their events in 2012 ) they paid an effective federal income tax rate of 23.7 per cent , according to their tax returns			1
they paid $ 16,444 in taxes to their home state of @entity105			0
@entity106 , a community college professor , also paid $ 3,470 in income tax to @entity108 , where she teaches			0
the @entity109 donated $ 20,523 to charity last year .			0

@entity28 ' total income in 2013 was less than their 2012 and 2011 income
ended up paying a *higher* tax rate , however , because they paid 18.4 **%** in 2012 when their income was $ 662,076
president @entity3 's book sales dropped to less than half of what they were
gave less to charity as a result but they still gave 12.3 **%**
avoided the ' millionaire 's tax ' that he implemented because his taxable income of $ 333,239 was less than the $ 450,000 cut off
