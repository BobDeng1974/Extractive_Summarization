it sprung up in between two more solidly constructed houses in @entity9 , east @entity10 , a month ago , leaving locals wondering who was behind it			1
now @entity14 is investigating the house , which is believed not to have planning permission , and is expected to order it to be torn down imminently			1
the makeshift house has sprung up in @entity19 , @entity9 , in the past month , leaving neighbours puzzled the wooden house began to be built a month ago , apparently without planning permission the wooden house , covered in plywood and lacking any obvious roof , fills a gap that used to house a dilapidated shed in the residential street			1
the plywood construction hides what used to be a dilapidated shed @entity30 in @entity19 , who said there was a garage there before the shed , say they have not noticed anyone living at the newly - sprung up house while construction work goes on			1
it consultant @entity38 , 41 , who has lived in @entity19 for 15 years , said : ' for a long time it was a horrible shed , not even a garage			1
' they seem to have put this bizarre front on it , but what was there before was really , really horrible			0
i do n’t have anything against it			0
' but one woman in her 70s who lives next door said : ' you ’re going to have to be quite thin to live in there			0
' @entity14 council said : ' we are investigating and will take appropriate action			2
' narrow houses , when built legally and with planning permission , can be a useful solution to @entity6 's housing crisis			1
the @entity61 house , in @entity62 on the @entity63 in @entity64 is believed to have the narrowest front of any house in the world , measuring just under 4ft ( 1.19m ) across at its narrowest point			0
the house , which was sold by owners @entity71 and @entity72 in 2001 , boasts a kitchen / sitting room downstairs and a bedroom and shower - room upstairs			0
a house in the @entity79 area of @entity80 measuring 6ft wide is another home where you may not be able to swing a cat - the owners installed a wooden ladder instead of stairs and said it was so narrow they did n't need to heat it as it was heated by its neighbours either side			2
