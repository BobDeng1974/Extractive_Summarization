snacking on unhealthy food should be viewed in the same way as smoking indoors , a leading anti-obesity expert has today claimed all meals should be served with vegetables , snacking should be socially unacceptable and a fizzy drinks tax must be introduced if the obesity epidemic is to be tackled , an expert said today			1
the government 's anti-obesity adviser said she wants food policy to be subjected to the same tough regulations as the tobacco industry			1
professor @entity16 , from @entity17 , said social norms are ' terribly important ' , and as such , grazing on unhealthy snacks should be frowned upon			1
poor diet is a leading cause of premature death in the @entity24 , accounting for 12.5 per cent of the total burden of disease , primarily due to cancer , cardiovascular disease and diabetes			0
two thirds of adults are overweight or obese as a result of overeating			0
in total obesity is linked to around 20 per cent of all ill health in the country , with 33,000 avoidable , early deaths a year , as a result			0
preventing these avoidable diseases should be the government 's focus , if the health service is to become more sustainable , professor @entity39 is expected to say tomorrow at the annual @entity44			1
the components of a healthy diet , consuming less saturated fat , sugar and salt while instead eating more fibre , fruit and vegetables , are well known			1
but to tackle the complex issues which have resulted in the rising tide of obesity in the @entity24 , tougher measures are needed			0
professor @entity39 , is expected to call for a tax on fizzy drinks to help tackle the issue			1
weight loss expert @entity60 said ' gentle , politically correct ' strategies have failed to encourage people to lose weight			0
instead he said ' constructive fat shaming ' , and ' shock tactics ' are the only way to help people realise they need to shed pounds			0
he said : ' as a weight loss specialist i advocate shock tactics including strong restaurant warning signs that read " if you are fat , think before ordering "			0
' passengers on a plane should also pay for two seats if they are too fat , and irresponsible parents feeding their fat kids junk should be prosecuted			0
' in addition assistants in fast food chains should refuse to serve dangerously fat customers			1
' the @entity80 needs to offer alternative solutions including hypnosis			0
' shock tactics drives motivation high			0
faffing about talking about food choices will no longer achieve the results we all want to see			1
' professor @entity39 , told @entity87 : ' when i was small , eating or drinking on the street was really , really bad form			1
' the other norm i worry about is around vegetable eating , because in our house it would be inconceivable if a meal did n't come with vegetables ... yet you go and have a meal out and often it will come without vegetables , you will have to buy those separately			1
' professor @entity16 , from @entity17 , is calling for a tax on fizzy drinks , which have no nutritional value but rot teeth , to start a series of new , tougher measures , to change the way society perceives unhealthy food and drink			1
she said : ' it sends out a powerful message that these are unhealthy foods and it is one way to start shifting consumer behaviour			2
' ( @entity116 image ) she questioned when as a society we will get to the point where it becomes normal to view vegetables as an integral part of each meal			2
and she championed a more structured approach to meals , with less emphasis on grazing , noting when snacking it is difficult to know how much you have eaten			1
both the conservatives and @entity131 have ruled out introducing a tax on junk food and fizzy drinks if they are to win the election on may 7			1
but professor @entity39 accused politicians of being ' too weak ' , urging them to take tougher action			2
she said fizzy drinks are a good place to introduce food taxation , because they have no nutritional value and rot teeth			1
the leading cause of childhood admissions in the this country is tooth decay , other experts have highlighted			0
professor @entity16 is one of the key anti-obesity advisers to the government professor @entity39 added : ' it sends out a powerful message that these are unhealthy foods and it is one way to start shifting consumer behaviour			1
' the only reason such a tax is not yet reality , is because of fears it will be ' publicly unpopular ' , she said			0
@entity160 , of the @entity161 , told @entity162 while he welcomes professor @entity39 's ideas they would take at least 20 years to implement			2
' @entity165 that we can change attitudes towards not snacking in public is , in my view , unrealistic , ' he said			2
' we now have the mind set that we eat on the go , snacking anywhere , in front of the tv , in the car , anywhere			1
' there is good evidence that suggests meal times are now set when people choose them to be , rather than being the set morning , lunch time and evening meals			2
' altering public opinion is difficult , if we were really set on it would take 20 years to change attitudes			0
' if we really want to make improvements we have got to make sure the food we are eating and buying is as healthy as possible			2
' he told @entity162 that legislation is ' absolutely necessary '			0
' if the level of taxation is as high as i think it should be , around 20 to 30 per cent i do think people would sit up and take notice , ' he said			2
' the question is how the taxation is applied			2
in my opinion it should be put on to the manufacturers			0
' the government needs to say to them that unless they bring down unhealthy levels of certain ingredients in their products they will be fined			1
' and they need to make it clear the manufacturers can not pass on the cost to consumers			0
' then it avoids the rise in the price of food , which affects those least able to pay the hardest			0
' we need legislation of some variety , professor @entity39 is absolutely right , some kind of tax on fizzy drinks is a no brainer , we should have seen it 10 years ago			1
' professor @entity39 pointed to evidence in @entity224 where the number of people drinking fizzy drinks dropped dramatically after the government there introduced a 10 per cent tax on sugary beverages			1
the nation is one of the heaviest in the @entity233 , with around 30 per cent of the population classed as being obese			0
but a survey , carried out last summer , reveals the new tax is making its mark			0
just over half of the 1,500 people questioned said they have reduced their intake of sugary drinks since the fiscal measure was implemented .			0
