by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 17:49 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 : 18:02 est , 20 december 2013 the number of @entity6 sailors who claim to have been poisoned by radiation while serving during the 2011 tsunami in @entity9 - resulting in cases of leukemia , thyroid and testicular cancers , chronic bronchitis and brain tumors - has jumped to 51 , as the group continue to fight the company they say did n't report the contamination when it happened			1
the @entity21 members who were allegedly infected - who served aboard the @entity22 and its sister ship the @entity23 - started to develop strange symptoms and sicknesses in the months following their mission near the @entity28 nuclear power plant , such as lumps , night sweats and dramatic weight - loss			1
now the majority of the group who worked in the rescue effort have been diagnosed with an assortment of diseases , after their ships ' desalination systems pulled in contaminated seawater that was used for drinking , cooking and bathing			1
sailors aboard the aircraft carrier @entity22 ( @entity46 76 ) conduct a counter-measure washdown to remove potential radiation contamination while operating off the coast of @entity9 providing humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami			1
some 51 sailors involved in the effort are claiming to have been contaminated sailors working aboard @entity22 during the 2011 tsunami effort in @entity28 , where a nuclear power plant went into meltdown , have been diagnosed with a variety of cancers they claim is a result of radiation contamination aerial shot shows white smoke billowing from a window in the no. 2 reactor building at the @entity68 nuclear power plant in @entity28 , northeastern @entity9 , following a tsunami in march 2011 in a lawsuit filed against @entity72 ( @entity72 ) , the plaintiffs claim the power company delayed telling the @entity21 the tsunami had caused a nuclear meltdown , sending huge amounts of contaminated water into the sea and , ultimately , into the ship 's water system			1
' at our level , we werenâ € ™ t told anything , ' @entity85 , who has been fighting bronchitis and hemorrhaging , told @entity88			2
' we were told everything was ok			2
' ' they said as long as the plume was avoided we would be fine			0
' but we knew then that something was going to happen			0
' common sense tells you that the wind would blow it everywhere			0
you donâ € ™ t need to be a nuclear scientist to figure that out			0
' @entity101 attorney @entity100 , who is representing the allegedly cancer - stricken sailors , initially filed a federal suit in the @entity104 more than a year ago on behalf of a dozen sailors			1

an earthquake measuring 8.9 on the @entity114 hit the northeast coast of @entity9 causing a tsunami the lawsuit was initially dismissed , when the court ruled that any ruling would hinge on interpreting communication between the @entity9 and @entity6 governments , which could violate the separation of powers			1
but @entity100 is amending the suit to add new allegations that would fall under the court 's jurisdiction			0
and the number of plaintiffs has more than quadrupled as more service members come forward with radiation - related illnesses , he said			0
' they went in to help with rescue efforts , ' said @entity100			0
' they did not go in prepared to deal with radiation containment			0
' the new suit will be refiled on january 6			0
the plaintiffs do n't blame the @entity21 , which they believe acted in good faith , @entity100 said			0
it was the plant 's operators who sat on the meltdown information during the crucial hours following the march 11 , 2011 disaster , he said			2
' @entity72 pursued a policy which caused rescuers , including the plaintiffs , to rush into an unsafe area which was too close to the [ @entity28 nuclear power plant ] that had been damaged , ' @entity100 charged in an april filing now being updated to add more plaintiffs			1

@entity9 authorities battling to contain rising pressure in nuclear reactors damaged by a massive earthquake were forced to release radioactive steam from one plant after evacuating tens of thousands of residents from the area ' relying upon the misrepresentation regarding health and safety made by @entity72 , upon information and belief , the @entity21 was lulled into a false sense of security			1
' the officers and crew of the @entity22 ( @entity46 - 76 ) and other vessels believed that it was safe to operate within the waters adjacent to the @entity178 , without doing the kinds of research and testing that would have verified the problems known to the defendant @entity72 at the time			1
' @entity185 , 22 , who served aboard the @entity23 , which was in the same deployment as the @entity22 , said sailors had no choice but to trust what they were told			1
' they did say it was safe at the time , ' @entity185 said			2
' we had to take their word for it			0
' @entity198 now suffers from leukemia and , while he is currently in remission , doctors have told him that he may need a bone marrow transplant			2
the @entity203 has been monitoring and collecting data on radiation exposure in the region , a @entity203 spokesman said			0
@entity72 officials have not responded to requests for comment			2
soldiers aboard the @entity23 aircraft carrier @entity22 ( pictured ) were unaware they were being contaminated by radiation while serving in the 2011 @entity9 tsunami effort @entity28 and were told by authorities the conditions were safe , claims their attorney but during a recent meeting before members of the @entity9 press on december 12 , former prime minister @entity217 said the first meltdown occurred five hours after the tsunami , not the next day as reported at the time			1
@entity100 believes the statement means the @entity9 government knew radiation was being leaked and did not inform the @entity21			1
' they knew there was an active meltdown and they deliberately hid it from the public as well as the @entity21 , ' @entity100 said			0
' those sailors went in there totally unaware and they were contaminated as a result			2
' @entity85 says she is prepared to have her symptoms questioned in court , should the case go to trial			0
but with so many @entity6 sailors coming forward , she believes justice will prevail			0
' people will say that out lawsuit is fake and that we are doing this for money , but itâ € ™ s really about getting the correct information out there , ' she said .			0

@entity22 and its sister ship @entity23 worked the rescue effort near the @entity28 nuclear power following the @entity9 tsunami in 2011
at the time sailors were told they were safe from radiation
diagnoses include leukemia , brain tumors and testicular cancer . the 51 they claim was caused by contaminated water
a new group action will be filed against @entity72 based on allegations they delayed releasing *confirmation* of the meltdown
