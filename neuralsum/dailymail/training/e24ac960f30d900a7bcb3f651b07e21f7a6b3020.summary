prince @entity1 is a ' t * * s and bums man ' who is prone to making spectacularly inappropriate comments about women , a former acquaintance has claimed			1
the source said @entity1 often breached the bounds of social acceptance with his remarks - including one that left a pregnant woman ' ashen - faced ' with shock			1
' he has always been a t * * s and bums man , ' said the acquaintance			0
the claims came as historic pictures of the @entity1 re-emerged , showing him surrounded by topless women in tiny bikinis enjoying an end - of - year holiday back in 2001			2
the picture , it is understood , was taken while @entity1 was on holiday in @entity24 , @entity25 , with his friend @entity26			1
it is known @entity26 and @entity1 regularly holidayed together - from weekends at @entity45 and @entity46 , to trips to @entity48			1
@entity26 was , the source told @entity50 , ' a big part of [ @entity1 's ] life ' - and pictures of the @entity54 surrounded by women thanks to the financier seem to have been par for the course			1
' it would always be , " @entity26 is in town with the girls " , and everyone would raise their eyes to heaven and move on , ' the source said			1
the unnamed source said , despite pictures like these of @entity1 surrounded by people , he did n't have many friends but prince @entity1 was close to @entity26 for a number of years - although the source described the billionaire as an ' unsavoury ' character but the former acquaintance has also said the @entity1 is ' quite a bad chooser of friends ' , describing @entity26 as ' a pretty unsavoury character '			1
@entity26 was jailed in 2008 for 13 months on a charge of soliciting sex with an underage girl			2
the @entity54 's unfortunate friendship with @entity26 has led him to be implicated in the latest scandal to hit the 61 - year - old @entity48			1
@entity82 alleges she was forced to have sex with him in the @entity84 while aged 17 and working as a masseuse for @entity26			2
@entity26 denies her claims that she was his ' sex slave '			2
the allegations – first revealed in @entity84 court documents last week , in which miss @entity82 , now 30 , claimed she had been forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002 – have also been vehemently denied by @entity93			0
yet despite the source 's qualms over some of @entity1 's ' schoolboy ' humour - they claimed ' he made some completely inappropriate comment to someone who was pregnant and had massive boobs ' , they did not believe he was involved			1
' you assumed some activity was happening , but i do n't think any of us actually thought he [ the duke ] was involved			0
' @entity26 and his then - girlfriend @entity108 - pictured here at @entity46 - were close friends of @entity1 for a number of years it is alleged it was @entity113 who introduced prince @entity1 and the then 17 - year - old ‘ sex slave ’ @entity82 , photographed here in 2001 the source described @entity26 as ' an unbelievable networker ' - and told @entity50 he was the @entity54 's intellectual superior			1
' i do n't know if he liked him or not			0
he probably thought he was an absolute buffoon			0
but he was the son of the @entity120			0
it probably came down to that , ' said the source			0
for a while , however , the two men — and their mutual friend @entity108 , daughter of the media tycoon @entity113 — were close			0
' they were good friends			0
it is generally understood that he was going to these parties			0
but i still question whether he did what he was being accused of doing			0
' what got him into trouble [ in 2011 ] , said the acquaintance , was @entity1 's ' foolishness and naivety , and arrogance — and hoping to have some fun '			1
' a heady mix. whereas @entity26 is much more manipulative and calculating			1
' an @entity84 journalist has revealed she tried to expose @entity26 's predatory behaviour 11 years ago - but @entity145 refused to print it			1
@entity147 , a contributing editor at the magazine for 11 years , was asked to profile the billionaire back in 2003			0
in a blog for @entity151 , ms @entity147 - who describes @entity26 as a ' gatsby-esque character ' - describes how she was made uncomfortable almost immediately			2
' @entity26 had invited me to an off - the - record tea at his @entity158 house ( during which i distinctly remember he rudely ate all the finger food himself ) and then had his assistant call to tell me he ’d thought i was pretty , ' she recalls			2
but it was n't the unwanted compliment which worried her : it was - among other things - a conversation she had with a mother of a 16 - year - old @entity26 had allegedly molested			2
' he ’d gotten to them because of his money , ' ms @entity147 wrote , adding : ' the girls ’ mother told me by phone that she had thought her daughters would be safe under @entity26 ’s roof , not least because he phoned her to reassure her , and she also knew he had @entity108 with him at all times			1
' but when she tried to include the account in her final piece , it was pulled			0
a @entity145 spokesman told the @entity151 the decision was taken because “ @entity26 denied the charges at the time and since the claims were unsubstantiated and no criminal investigation had been initiated , we decided not to include them in what was a financial story ”			0
but ms @entity147 - who said @entity26 had ' a way of spooking you ' - says it was n't a financial piece - adding : ' it has often struck me that if my piece had named the women , the @entity199 might have come after @entity26 sooner and perhaps some of his victims , now , in the latest spate of allegations , allegedly either paid off or too fearful of retribution to speak up , would have been saved			0

former friend says one comment left pregnant woman ' ashen with shock '
described @entity54 's humour as ' schoolboy stuff '
revealed @entity1 's *excitement* when @entity26 was in town ' with the girls '
but acquaintance does not believe he would be involved in scandal
says billionaire @entity26 was ' manipulative and calculating '
