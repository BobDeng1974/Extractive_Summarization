@entity1 referees are to ditch their pink jerseys , because they believe it jeopardises their authority			1
with the @entity6 season due to begin again this week , the @entity5 is reporting that officials have been switched out of pink for the coming campaign			1
instead , the referees will wear blue or red , depending on the kits of the two teams involved in any game			2
@entity6 referees have ditched the idea of pink jerseys after claims they undermined official 's authority the new colours have been chosen as they apparently encourage discipline but the move has come in for criticism			1
performance psychologist @entity25 said it was purely a symbolic gesture which would n't change how the game was refereed			0
' the colour of a uniform is irrelevant to the skill execution of referees , just the same as the colour of a jersey worn by players is irrelevant to their skill execution , ' he said			2
' in short , the colour of a uniform should n't matter as it does n't directly impact on the performance of a referee , which ultimately has the most influence on their perceived credibility			0
' officials will wear red or blue for the new season , which starts this , in a move that has been criticised there was also a suggestion that the @entity6 risked alienating the gay community and breast cancer awareness campaigners			1
dr @entity53 , from the @entity54 , told the @entity55 it was a move away from ' social inclusion			0
' ' if you are wanting a more inclusive football community you have to be more aware of the symbolisms of marginal groups within that community , ' he said .			0
