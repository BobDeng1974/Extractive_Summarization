in an historic intervention , the central bank announced plans to ration risky loans by banning lenders from issuing any more than 15 per cent of their new mortgages at 4.5 times an applicant ’s salary or higher			1
governor @entity15 said the curbs should not make it any harder to get a mortgage – as the proportion is already below 15 per cent – and will have a ‘ minimal impact ’ on the housing market as long as prices rise in line with its expectations			1
@entity0 governor @entity15 has moved to cool the housing market with new rules limiting large mortgages shares in the @entity29 ’s biggest housebuilders soared yesterday on hearing of the new regime , which will be enforced on october 1			1

the @entity0 is expecting house prices to rise by 20 per cent by early 2017 , pushing the price of an average home from £ 186,512 to £ 223,814			2
it also expects household debt levels to rise by 15 per cent in that time			2
mr @entity15 said both scenarios were at ‘ the limit of our tolerance ’ , suggesting he is prepared to take further action if the market accelerates any faster than that			0
the @entity44 described yesterday ’s move as an ‘ insurance policy ’ to prevent the housing market from spinning out of control and ensure households do not take on too much debt			0
at the same time the @entity51 announced a ban on loans above 4.5 times salary on its help to buy mortgage guarantee scheme			1
chancellor @entity57 said the new rules will ' help protect our hard - won economic security by better insuring us against any risks that might emerge in our housing market '			1
house prices in @entity64 rose by 18.7 per cent in the year to april , almost twice the national average of 9.9 per cent he added : ' in the years before the @entity68 the failure to do this cost families dear and took our economy to the brink			0
' i gave the @entity0 these new powers because i ’m determined that we do n’t repeat the mistakes of the past			0
' i want to protect those who own homes , protect those who aspire to own a home , and protect the millions who suffer when boom turns to bust			0
' today ’s announcement is a welcome sign that the new system we have created is working			0
' prices rose by 9.9 per cent in the year to april , surging by 18.7 per cent in @entity64			0
in 33 areas of @entity0 and @entity91 , property prices increased in value by more than annual local wages			0
first - time buyers have been hardest hit by the boom , with prices for them rising by more than 10 per cent in a year			1
people getting on to the first rung of the property ladder paid a record £ 199,000 in april , almost 10 times the average salary of people in their twenties			0
the new @entity0 rules could make it even harder to buy a house , with lenders forced to limit the number of large loans available			1
the @entity109 has recommended that ' mortgage lenders do not extend more than 15 per cent of their total number of new residential mortgages at loan to income ratios at or greater than 4.5 '			1
prices paid by first - time buyers are up 10.7 per cent year - on - year , but only 9.5 per cent for those already on the property ladder the rule will apply to all lenders who lend more than £ 100million each year and should be ' implemented as soon as is practicable '			1
it is already getting harder for buyers to get a loan , with banks limiting mortgage approvals despite rising demand			2
the @entity0 reports that lenders forecast a ' lower appetite for risk ' over the next three months high street banks and lenders expect the number of new mortgage agreements to fall significantly from july to september			1
it follows changes to the @entity135 which forces lenders to more closely scrutinise borrowers ' income and outgoings to check if they can afford repayments if interest rates rise			1
the @entity0 base rate of interest has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent since 2009 in the past , people applying for a mortgage were asked for three months ’ pay slips and recent bank statements to show their major outgoings			2
but since april they have faced invasive questions about their finances and lifestyle , from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership			0
the new rules limiting the amount that can be loaned in relation to incomes will also push down mortgage approval rates			1
the @entity0 is putting more pressure on lenders to ensure their customers are prepared for , and able to cope with , a likely rise in interest rates			1
on tuesday governor @entity15 appeared to row back on a warning last week that rates could rise before the end of the year , leading to claims he was blowing hot and cold on when families could expect mortgage costs to increase			2
giving evidence to the treasury select committee , he told @entity178 that low wage growth and spare capacity in the economy meant a rate rise this year was less likely			2
@entity184 mp @entity183 said : ' @entity185 is behaving a bit like an unreliable boyfriend			0
' one day hot , one day cold and the people on the other side of the message do n't know where they stand			0
' last year the @entity0 said interest rates would not rise until the unemployment rate fell to 7 per cent , but when that target was met earlier than expected , it set broader criteria for a rise			1
having signalled an early rise last week , mr @entity15 today appeared more doveish and played down the idea			0
mr @entity183 added : ' the purpose of guidance is to achieve clarity of expectations among households and consumers			0
' but mr @entity15 insisted the message from bank guidance had been ' very clearly received '			0
' as the economy progresses , the time to normalise interest rates is edging closer			1
but what is most relevant is those adjustments will be through a gradual process that is likely to be lower that historical averages			0
