a high school football team achieved a feat considered almost impossible in the sport , after the ball bounced off a defender 's helmet to score a freak ' own goal '			1
on an extra point attempt , kicker @entity8 was disappointed when the ball came out low and looked likely to land well below the crossbar			2
but to his surprise - and that of everyone watching - the ball slammed into a defender 's head before bouncing off and sailing through the uprights			1
clearly , their luck did n't end there as the @entity25 went on to win the game 51 - 0			1
a video of @entity34 scoring the lucky extra point has gone viral on @entity36 , with close to 400,000 views			1
@entity39 â€™s @entity38 had live - streamed the game and realized that he had recorded a once in a lifetime play and immediately posted the clip online			2
although relatively common in soccer , an ' own goal ' is almost unheard of in @entity44			2
@entity27 were already trailing 37 - 0 when kicker @entity8 lined up for the extra point ' i did n't know how to react , ' @entity46 , an 18 - year old in his senior year , told the @entity49			1
' once they said it was good , i was just pumped			0
as long as it gets through ( the goal posts ) it counts			0
' @entity46 said he was shocked by the surprise goal but added that his classmates think it 's a bigger deal that he does			0
' they wo n't stop talking about it , ' he told the paper			0
' people will come up to me and say ' hey , you 're famous			0
' but it was just one play			0
' the ball hit the crossbar and sailed through the uprights to give the @entity25 an extra point since play like this is so rare , there was some confusion initially whether the extra point should be allowed			1
