by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 15 march 2014 updated : 19:41 est , 15 march 2014 neurosurgeon @entity0 is leaving the @entity2 after 30 years frustrated at the bureaucracy that he claims is ruining the health service i have been an @entity2 brain surgeon for more than 30 years			1
every operation i perform carries grave risks			1
the slightest slip can bring paralysis or death			1
i also know that , in many cases , time is vital			1
but @entity2 bureaucracy has made working in the health service feel like swimming in treacle , bringing intense frustration for doctors and danger for patients			1
it is only now , as i prepare to leave the @entity2 , that i feel able to speak my mind			1
when i cycle to work in the morning , i never quite know what is going to happen – not only because i can never be certain how well the operations will go , but also because often i do not know whether i will get any operating done at all			1
one crucial problem is a chronic shortage of beds			1
the other is that the many reorganisations of the @entity2 have left a gaping hole in its centre – leadership			1
we all know effective organisations need leadership			1
in the past it was provided – for better or worse – by doctors			1
they have now been displaced , but not replaced			1
the many thousands of health professionals in the @entity2 who work so hard for their patients have no real leadership – and that is why the whole organisation seems to be permanently in disarray			1
@entity2 bureaucracy has made working in the health service feel like swimming in treacle , bringing intense frustration for doctors and danger for patients ( file photo ) my daily routine illustrates why doctors should be in charge of clinical decision - making in the @entity2			1
i went in to work one monday morning to operate			1
i was also on call for emergencies			1
i knew the hospital was full to bursting and could only hope there would be no emergency referrals			2
three operations were planned – two patients with brain tumours and one with a spinal slipped disc			2
the brain tumour patients would need intensive care beds after surgery			2
but the last two had been filled with emergencies during the night			2
the lives of the tumour patients depended on their being operated on			2
if i could not do their operations today , the ageing of the population and constant , expensive , technological progress means the @entity2 will always be in a state of crisis ( file photo ) i would have to cancel other patients ’ operations later in the week , with endless knock - on effects			1
the spinal case , who was in severe pain , had already had his operation cancelled twice for lack of beds			2
he was very upset when i apologised on the second occasion two weeks ago			2
outside the operating theatres , doctors and nurses looked glumly at a computer			2
‘ the network has crashed again , ’ my registrar @entity101 told me			2
‘ i ca n’t even find the tumour patients , ’ my anaesthetist @entity103 said			2
i ’d seen them on the male ward but they ’d been moved			2
one crucial problem is a chronic shortage of beds			2
the other is that the many reorganisations of the @entity2 have left a gaping hole in its centre ( file photo ) @entity117 , our bed manager , told me we could do the tumour cases provided we could clear two spaces on the female ward , but that depended on whether we could move some patients back to local hospitals			1
i would n’t be allowed to start the list until we heard			2
in the past , i would jump up and down and shout when we had no beds and we would start anyway			2
a bed was always found because one had to be found			0
in the past , i would jump up and down and shout when we had no beds and we would start anyway			0
a bed was always found because one had to be found			0
now , i would be reported for bullying			0
so we wait until the managerial wheels have ground and a bed has been found			0
the end result is the same – emergency cases take priority over non-emergencies			0
in the past , doctors could make these decisions quickly and efficiently			0
now , many hours of managerial negotiation are required			0
two hours later , we started operating – it is unusual to start at the official time of 8.30am			0
the medical profession has been in retreat for many years , battered by one scandal after another and the rise of the new managerial class			0
trust in doctors has been replaced by regulation ( file photo ) the first operation was difficult , but once we had finished , @entity103 sent for the second case			0
i was drinking a cup of coffee when @entity161 , the registrar taking emergency calls , arrived			0
‘ there ’s a 51 - year - old woman with a subarachnoid haemorrhage and acute hydrocephalus			1
but there are no @entity169 beds unless you cancel the second tumour op. ’ i shot off to the anaesthetic room , but the patient had already been anaesthetised			0
i either had to cancel his operation or find another @entity177 bed			0
the many thousands of health professionals in the @entity2 who work so hard for their patients have no real leadership and that is why the whole organisation seems to be permanently in disarray ( pictured is @entity185 ) after a 20 - minute discussion , we managed to find a bed , which involved moving four other patients around			1
ten minutes later , as i was starting the second operation , @entity161 put her head round the theatre doors			0
‘ they now say there is n’t going to be a bed after all , ’ she said			0
the spinal case , needless to say , was cancelled for a third time			0
in the past , we used to have a waiting list			0
my waiting list for spinal surgery was almost a year long ( although my offers to come in at weekends and operate free of charge were consistently turned down by management )			0
the waiting list acted like a reservoir and allowed for the fact that emergencies can come in sudden runs that risk overwhelming the hospital			0
but cost - cutting in the @entity2 demands that we now have no spare capacity and waiting lists are politically unacceptable			1
but waiting lists allow surgeons to use their clinical judgment to get through operations in a sensible order			0
patients , politicians and management must accept that emergencies should not have to compete for beds with the routine cases as currently happens			0
the central issue the @entity2 faces – demand for healthcare outstripping its supply – is by no means unique to this country			1
the ageing of the population and constant , expensive , technological progress means the @entity2 will always be in a state of crisis			1
the central issue the @entity2 faces , demand for healthcare outstripping its supply , is by no means unique to this country ( file photo ) re-establishing clinical leadership by doctors will not resolve these problems but it would at least lessen their impact on patients			1
the trouble is that the medical profession has been in steady retreat for many years , battered by one scandal after another and the rise of the new managerial class			0
trust in doctors has been replaced by regulation			0
of course doctors need regulating , but so much of today ’s regulation is absurd			0
in order to be revalidated by the @entity256 as a brain surgeon , i have had to pass a test that includes questions about the shape of stool specimens			0
my colleagues and i were recently threatened with disciplinary action for wearing wrist watches and not being ‘ bare from the elbows ’ when merely talking to patients			0
next year , with considerable regret , i will leave the health service after 36 years			1
like most doctors , i feel strongly that the principles of the @entity2 – free treatment for everybody irrespective of class , race or wealth – are essential to a civilised society			1
i intend to spend more time working in @entity277 and other countries where life is much more difficult			1
countries which help you appreciate – despite its many faults and problems – the value of our @entity2			1
