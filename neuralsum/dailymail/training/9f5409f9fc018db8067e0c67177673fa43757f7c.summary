by @entity0 most of us take telling the time for granted			0
but for visually impaired people it can be a real struggle and sometimes a speaking clock just is n’t practical			0
however , a new tactile watch is about to hit the shops that lets people tell the time just by touching it – and it ’s so stylish that many people with perfect vision are also ordering one for themselves			2
the @entity14 has a minimalistic titanium face with gently protruding markings , but no numbers or hands			1
it is named after @entity27 gold medal winner @entity25 ( pictured right ) and features two distinctive grooves with ball bearings set inside them that denote the minutes and hours of the day instead of traditional watch hands , time is indicated by two ball bearings			1
the one towards the centre of the watch indicates the passing minutes and one marking the hours is positioned on the side			2
the ball bearings are connected to a watch movement beneath the casing with magnets			1
if the ball bearings are pressed a little too hard and are moved accidently , a user can shake their wrist and they spring back to show the correct time			1
its unique feature is two ball bearings set into grooves that people can touch to tell the time			1
the ball in the central groove rotates to mark the minutes , while another set into the side of the timepiece travels round the face to denote the hours			1

‘ most clocks and watches require vision and checking the time is still a big problem if you 're visually impaired			0
we wanted to develop a timepiece where you can touch time , ’ he said			0
‘ this is a timepiece and not a watch because you do n’t have to watch this to tell the time			2
’ touch the time : as well as helping visually impaired people live independently mr @entity60 explained it 's been a hit with people with perfect sight too			0
there are occasions - from lectures and job interviews to dinner with the in - laws - when looking at a watch is considered rude and telling the time by touch solves that problem , he said because of its striking design , the timepiece is proving a hit with everyone and mr @entity60 explained that there are so many occasions – from lectures and job interviews to dinner with the in - laws – when looking at a watch or smartphone is considered rude and telling the time by touch solves the problem			2

lieutenant @entity25 served with the @entity109 in @entity108 , dealing with unexploded devices , until one day in 2011 he was blinded when one of the @entity112 blew up in his face			1
while he went on to win two gold medals and a silver in swimming at the @entity116 in @entity117 , adjusting to everyday life was difficult for him – particularly telling the time			1

at the beginning it was very disorienting			0
and especially being in the military , time is all important			0
’ after meeting mr @entity140 through a mutual friend , he became the face of the watch , which is hoped will change many more people ’s lives when it launches this summer			2
mr @entity134 had been using a speaking watch , but said : ‘ as soon as i hit that button it highlights me as someone with a special need			0
i love the idea of using the same thing that everyone does			0
and i want to feel as normal as possible			0
