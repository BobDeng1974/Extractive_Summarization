by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 05:26 est , 4 july 2012 @entity1 goes inside : @entity2 gets the indoors treatment with internet maps evolving so much in the last few years - and now becoming photo - realistic @entity6 - there seems little fresh territory left to explore , so @entity1 has been doing some internalising			1
the search engine has been plotting the insides of public venues across the @entity12 , allowing @entity15 smartphone users the ability to navigate around areas such as @entity2 or the @entity18 shopping department in @entity19			1
the locations are currently very @entity19 - centric , although the search engine plans to roll out more venues across the @entity12 shortly			1
@entity24 's search competitor @entity23 has also begun mapping the inside world , with @entity26 allowing you to explore nearly all major shopping centres across the @entity12			1
@entity1 spokesman @entity29 said : ' given the current @entity12 weather , we seem to be spending a lot more of the summer than we ’d hoped indoors			2
' the thing about being indoors is that people often get lost - i ’m not talking about in your own home , of course , but when you ’re out and about , in train stations , museums , department stores and shopping centres			2
' we ’re happy to announce that today @entity1 is launching indoor maps for @entity15 devices in the @entity12			1
' you ’ll no longer need to feel clueless when you ’re at the railway station , trying to figure out where to buy a coffee before you rush to catch your train from platform 11 ; nor will you feel embarrassed about asking for the lingerie section when you ’re in the department store - because you ’ll have all the answers in the palm of your hand			0
' just open @entity1 on your @entity15 mobile phone , zoom in to the location you ’re in and the indoor floor plan magically appears ' and for buildings where the information is available , we ’ll even show you where you are on the map with a familiar blue dot if you ’ve enabled the my location feature			2
' next , search for the location you ’d like to get to and we ’ll provide directions to help you get there - even if you ’re on a completely different floor			0
' @entity1 has released a list of their supported venues here			0
@entity70 added : ' more than 40 venues in the @entity12 have worked with us to have their indoor floor plans appear on @entity1 , ranging from train stations to art galleries , department stores to sporting venues			1
' in fact , any building owner can upload their maps for future inclusion in @entity1			0
' @entity2 and @entity82 are both plotted , and a toggle ( 'm ' , ' g ' ) lets you move between different floor levels visiting the @entity87 ? @entity1 offers the ability to browse the popular gig venue @entity18 , all five floors of it , has been mapped out , and you can zoom and pan around the centre to find your chosen departments @entity26 has also been rolling out new indoor features , with 2,700 venues across the world mapped out , including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			1
the @entity12 appears particularly well covered , with most towns having an internal map , discoverable on both @entity26 , and the @entity104 and @entity105			2
a @entity23 spokesman said : ' whether you live in @entity108 or @entity109 , @entity110 or @entity111 , or pretty much anywhere in - between , you will now be able to explore your local shopping centre through @entity23 maps - helping you locate the stores you are looking for , find the closest services and facilities like restrooms and cash machines , and even browse their directories			0
' through @entity24 ’s partnership with @entity122 , @entity26 just boosted its @entity124 coverage in the @entity125 and internationally expanding the experience to more than 2,700 @entity127 across the world			0
this update is primarily focused on shopping malls across @entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101			0
' the maps arena is certainly heating up , with @entity132 preparing to ditch @entity1 on @entity133 in favour of an in - house version , and @entity136 also getting in to the maps game with this week 's purchase of mapping start - up @entity139			0
@entity26 has also introduced a similar feature , with most @entity12 shopping centres mapped out , such as the town of @entity144 , in @entity145			1

@entity1 offers *rotating* *3d* views of 40 indoor venues around @entity19
@entity26 provides maps for nearly all shopping centres within the @entity12
