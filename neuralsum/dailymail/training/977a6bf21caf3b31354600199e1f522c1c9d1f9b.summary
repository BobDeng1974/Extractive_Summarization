by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 4 july 2013 they are typically found floating in the ocean 's depths - so just how did this octopus end up 978m above sea level at the peak of @entity8 's tallest mountain ? a team of litter pickers carrying out a clean - up on @entity12 were left baffled when they came across the body of a dead octopus nestled on the rocks close to the mountain 's summit			1
mystery surrounds the manner in which the dead sea creature came to land on the lofty perch in the @entity22 - with some suggesting the cephalopod was dropped by a bird after being scooped up from the @entity25			1
mystery : the dead octopus was discovered by a team of litter pickers carrying out a clean - up near the summit of @entity12 - @entity8 's highest mountain it would have taken a powerful bird to haul the octopus - which measured around 10 inches from the top of its head to the tip of its tentacles - so high in the air			1
the @entity44 beauty spot is home to nesting @entity46 , and sea eagles have recently begun to colonise the area thanks to a breeding programme in @entity50			2
but @entity51 , who discovered the dead creature , suspects its presence on top of the mountain may have been the result of a prank			1
bizarre : could a bird have dropped the dead sea creature at the summit of the @entity12 in the @entity22 ? ' it appeared quite fresh , but i suppose it could have been someone 's idea of a joke , ' he said			1
' if not that , it raises the question of why the bird would carry it all the way up the top of the mountain and then lose it and not eat it			0
' but i am not an ornithologist , so it remains a mystery , ' he said			0
mr @entity51 , from @entity78 , was taking a party of volunteers up @entity12 to clear away litter left by other visitors when he stumbled across the bizarre find			0
the trained mountain leader , who said swathes of litter is left behind on the mountain by tourists and climbers taking part in the popular @entity91 , said his team brought ten black bags of rubbish down with them off @entity12 that day - including the octopus			2
' it is easily the most unusual thing we have found on @entity12 - we were quite surprised when we came across it , ' he said			0
' we were just at the summit cairn where it was quite windy and misty and i saw something on a rock which i thought was a child 's toy - a teddy bear or a glove puppet			1
but on going over to it i realised it was a dead octopus			2
' last year on @entity109 i did find a whole trout in a carrier bag near the summit cairn			0
so my first reaction when i saw the octopus was that someone carried it up as some kind of as a prank			0
' then i gave it some thought and realised it was possible that a bird had somehow dropped it , though it would have to have been a big bird			1
' the octopus was put into a black sack and disposed of with the rest of the rubbish , by being dumped in a skip at the foot of the mountain			0
theories : an octopus in its usual habitat - swimming through the ocean			0

dead sea creature found by litter pickers near summit of @entity22 peak
*initially* thought the octopus was a child 's glove puppet
may have been scooped from the @entity25 by a bird and dropped
