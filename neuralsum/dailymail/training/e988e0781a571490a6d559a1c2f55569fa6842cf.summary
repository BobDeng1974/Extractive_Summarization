the @entity68 said : ‘ the government 's response was late , woefully short on detail and fails to take account of recent developments			0

' he added that under @entity95 immigration was ' out of control ' with net migration into the @entity6 topping 2.2 million			1

@entity95 supports strong controls to bring immigration down			0
' but these figures demonstrate that the government is not focussing on the kind of immigration that worries people the most			0
' the government is doing nothing to tackle illegal immigration			0
the data today shows another fall in deporting people who have broken the rules and another reduction in people being stopped at the border			0

until the government addresses what most concerns people , anxiety will continue to grow			0
