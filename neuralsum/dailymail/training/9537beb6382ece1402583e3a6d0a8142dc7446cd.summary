after summer floods and droughts , freezing winters and even widespread snow in may this year , something is clearly wrong with @entity6 's weather			1
concerns about the extreme conditions the @entity6 consistently suffers have increased to such an extent that the @entity10 has called a meeting next week to talk about it			1
experts will travel to the forecaster 's headquarters in @entity32 on tuesday for the meeting			2
attendees are expected to debate whether the changing weather pattern in the @entity6 , and in northern @entity36 , is because of climate change or simply variable weather			1
' we have seen a run of unusual seasons in the @entity6 and northern @entity36 , such as the cold winter of 2010 , last year 's wet weather and the cold spring this year , ' a @entity10 spokesman told the @entity44			1
' this may be nothing more than a run of natural variability , but there may be other factors impacting our weather			2
' there is emerging research which suggests there is a link between declining @entity56 sea ice and @entity36 climate - but exactly how this process might work and how important it may be among a host of other factors remains unclear			0
' digging out : @entity6 's winters have been particularly extreme , with most areas of the @entity6 being hit with heavy snow at some point since 2010 @entity65 : despite being taken on december 27 2012 , this picture of @entity68 pub near @entity69 shows the warm wet conditions the @entity6 will suffer experts will identify what further research is needed and discuss whether climate models need to be revised to take into account any recent changes to weather patterns it comes after the @entity79 reported that wheat harvests are likely to be around 30 per cent lower than last year as a result of the extreme weather			1
earlier this month the @entity10 said below average temperatures throughout march , april and may made it the fifth coldest spring in national records dating back to 1910 and the coldest spring since 1962			1
march was ' exceptionally ' cold , averaging 2.2 Â° @entity86 in more bad news , this week forecasters warned unsettled and wet conditions could last until the end of july and into august			0
scorched : this picture of @entity92 in the summer of 2010 shows how dry the @entity6 summer can be the last two weeks of warmer , clear days have been replaced by erratic conditions , including rain and high winds of up to 40mph , interspersed with pockets of warm , sunny and dry periods			2
forecasters have attributed the unpredictable stretch - which is being caused by a south shifting jet stream - to just another ' typical @entity6 summer '			0
the ' blink and you 'd miss it summer ' is the latest in six months of unsettled weather , including a particularly bitter winter , and unseasonably cold @entity107 - which saw the coldest @entity108 on record			0
extreme rain : this graph shows that since the 1960s there has been more and more days of torrential rain a year in @entity6 @entity115 spots : this map of @entity6 shows where the the highest levels of torrential rain in 24 hours tends to fall jet streams are belts of fast flowing , narrow air currents found in the atmosphere , formed near air masses with significantly different temperatures			2
they are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes			0
the polar jet stream , which is the most northerly jet stream , affects the @entity6 , and tends to be further south in the winter and further north in the summer			0
but it has been sitting further south than is normal for this time of year , which is why the @entity6 looks set to experience a wet summer .			0

@entity10 has called extreme weather meeting for next week
experts to discuss if it is result of climate change or just typically @entity6
@entity140 sparked after @entity6 suffered its coldest spring for 50 years
