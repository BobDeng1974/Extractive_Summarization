quite what the little boy who lives down the lane would make of it is open to conjecture			2
but parents at one school made their feelings plain when they heard their children reciting ‘ @entity9 ’			1
they accused the £ 2,700 - a - term @entity11 primary school of changing the words from ‘ @entity13 ’ for the sake of political correctness			0
political correctness gone mad : at their @entity20 concert , pupils at @entity18 swapped the word ' black ' in @entity13 for ' little ' as they sang bemused : @entity22 tweets after she saw her son 's @entity20 concert the school , in @entity26 upon @entity27 , @entity28 , insists this was not the reason , and that the change was merely a way of teaching children to read by adding different words			1
adults who attended its @entity20 concert , however , were unconvinced			1
@entity22 , a councillor whose son sang in the show , tweeted : ‘ at my son ’s @entity20 concert i saw a song called @entity9 which i assumed was new			1
not so – not allowed black			0
really ? ’ councillor @entity42 upon @entity27 was surpised by the change of wording in @entity13 she said most parents in the audience were concerned about the change of wording			0
‘ it ’s good they want children to think about what different words mean			1
but this is one nursery rhyme i personally do n’t think should be used because it could be so easily misconstrued as political correctness gone mad			0
they have got to be a bit smarter about it			0
’ the school uses the phonic learning system to teach children aged three to seven word meanings through well - known songs and rhymes			1
its marketing manager @entity65 said @entity13 had been changed ‘ because it fitted in with the theme of what we were doing			1
it was about baby sheep			0
‘ we have always had adjustments to @entity13 just because the children like to sing different variations of that			2
it ’s a way of teaching phonics so that children understand these words that they are using and then reading			1
’ this is far from the first time the rhyme has been amended			0
in 2006 , children at two nurseries in @entity83 were taught ‘ @entity13 ’ to promote ‘ equal opportunities ’			2
some children in @entity86 have been taught ‘ @entity87 ’			2
and in 1999 , @entity88 said the rhyme should not be taught at all because it was racially negative .			0

pupils at @entity18 sang @entity9 instead of the *traditional* version at their @entity20 concert
@entity95 said the song had been changed to teach children phonics and to fit in with the @entity20 theme
