researchers from @entity1 discovered birds with similar personalities flock together by tracking great tits , pictured , around @entity5 birds choose their friends and mates based not only on species , but also by personality , according to new research			1
shy male great tits tend to seek the company of other birds with the same disposition , claim scientists from @entity1 , while introverted adolescent birds are more likely to avoid the party crowd and keep to their own			1
researchers made the discovery after tracking thousands of birds with radio tags around @entity5 near @entity1 , in a bid to map their social networks			1
the study also found that shy birds of both sexes , while having smaller groups of ' friends ' than their bolder counterparts , tended to form more stable relationships			1
@entity34 , from the university , said : ' there has been a lot of work describing the range of individual personalities in the great tit			0
' now we are linking it to the social networks and social organisation of the species , which has n't been done before			0
' the scientists recorded millions of visits made by the birds to 65 feeding stations over an entire winter to see how they interacted socially			1
birds were rated on a personality scale ranging from shy to bold , and individuals tested by introducing them to new environments			1
typically shy birds explored a strange environment very slowly , whereas bold birds carried out their recces quickly			1
the birds ' personalities were found to influence their social behaviour			2
@entity65 and more outgoing birds chose quantity over quality in their relationships			0
they had weaker associations with more birds than shy individuals , and foraged with several different groups			2
' measuring the social networks we could see that bolder birds tended to hop between foraging flocks and have short - term foraging associations , while shy birds tended to maintain a foraging association over a long time , ' said @entity34			1
birds were rated from shy to bold			2
typically shy birds explored a strange environment slowly , whereas bold birds carried out their recces quickly			1
@entity65 and more outgoing birds chose quantity over quality in their relationships			0
while shy great tits , similar to the ones pictured , formed fewer but stronger bonds recent research from @entity87 in @entity88 found that birds observe speed limits on roads even if motorists choose to ignore them			1
on roads with higher speed limits , birds are quicker to take to the air to avoid oncoming traffic , but where limits are lower , they wait longer			0
the behaviour is related to speed restrictions and not the result of birds assessing the speed of approaching vehicles			0
' shy birds are following a social strategy where they maintain a few strong and stable social associations to minimise risk			2
' hopping between many flocks may increase risks for bolder birds , but might maximise rewards through improving their social position and giving them better access to information , such as the location of food			0
' while shy male birds tended to gravitate to similar individuals , shy females associated freely with all personalities , she said			0
she added : ' we think shy male birds might group together to avoid the more aggressive bold birds			2
' professor @entity130 , director of the @entity131 at @entity1 's @entity132 , said : '' by uncovering the way that different types of individuals interact non-randomly , we hope to understand how this controls the way that many processes work within populations			0
' for instance , the way that information , and disease , spread in populations depends on the structure of the social network , and our work now tells us part of the reason for that structure			0
' the findings are reported in the journal @entity154 .			0

researchers tracked thousands of great tits in @entity5 , @entity1
they *monitored* 65 feeding stations to see how birds interacted socially
birds were rated on a personality scale ranging from shy to bold
bold birds had more relationships , while shy birds had small social groups
