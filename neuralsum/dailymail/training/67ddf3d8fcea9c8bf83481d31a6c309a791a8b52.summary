@entity0 insisted he felt comfortable in chasing down and passing title rival @entity1 at a rainy @entity3 @entity2 on sunday			1
the race in @entity5 was overshadowed by a crash involving @entity8 's @entity7 , who was left requiring surgery after suffering severe head injuries following a collision with a recovery vehicle			1
but , in terms of the now trivial battle between the @entity16 duo for this year 's drivers ' championship , @entity0 was the man to come out on top - picking up a third consecutive win to move 10 points clear of his @entity22 colleague			1
@entity0 set about passing pole - sitter @entity1 once enough standing water had been cleared to allow the race to begin in earnest			1
and , even though he was following closely behind his team - mate for several laps , @entity0 felt in control of the race			2
' @entity1 and i had a tough battle , we were pushing really hard , ' he said			2
' i had a big moment at turn one when i was too late getting off the @entity48 as i was just pushing so hard but fortunately i was able to get back on track			0
' the conditions were difficult throughout but i had more pace than @entity1 and could follow him quite comfortably in the early stages			2
@entity1 leads @entity16 team - mate @entity0 in the early stages in wet conditions at @entity5 ' this is not an easy circuit for following another car or for overtaking , but he made a mistake out of the last corner and i was able to pass			1
the whole approach then needed to change to look after the tyres and make sure i stayed in the lead until the end of the race			2
' this was @entity0 's maiden victory at @entity5 and comes at a crucial time in his quest for a second world championship			1
@entity1 had out - performed the @entity70 in saturday 's dry qualifying session but was left conceding it was a case of " damaged limitations " after he came out second - best on race day			1
' i struggled a lot with the balance of my car on the intermediate tyres , so i had to push hard to keep @entity0 behind me , ' he said			2
' i had a lot of oversteering which is why the rear end of my car was very nervous			0
that was really strange and i did n't have the necessary confidence in the corners ; we need to look into that in the next few days			0
@entity0 ( centre ) is on top of the podium alongside @entity1 ( left ) and @entity90 ' it meant that @entity0 was quicker today and deserved the win			1
it was damage limitation with losing only seven points to him			0
for the team it was a good result with another one - two			0
' @entity90 , who announced on saturday he was to leave @entity98 at the end of the season , took the final place on the podium after being the fastest man on track during the middle stages of the race			0
his team - mate @entity107 , who will lead the team when @entity90 completes his widely - anticipated move to @entity110 , was fourth with @entity111 unfortunate to only come home fifth having enjoyed one of his best performances of the season			0
the 2009 champion peeled off into the pits to change from full wet tyres and onto the intermediate option as soon as the safety car had come in			0
@entity0 negotiates tough conditions before emerging victorious for his maiden victory at @entity5 and @entity111 benefited from the decision as those left on track followed his lead - with the @entity128 man moving up into third place as a result			1
the ultimately superior pace of the @entity98 duo meant the 34 - year - old could not take his first podium since the opening race in @entity136 , with his future still a mystery as rumours @entity139 is to return to the @entity142 - based team			0
but @entity128 race director @entity143 was happy with the performance of @entity111 , as the team continues to fight with @entity145 over fifth place in the constructors 's standings			2
@entity111 put in one of his best performances of the season to finish in fifth place ' @entity111 was the first driver in the field to stop to fit intermediates , and , having done so , thereafter he drove very well all afternoon , ' said @entity143			0
' indeed , he may well have finished third had things panned out better for us at the end of the race in terms of @entity160 and pit - stop timing			0
' even so , the 10 points he scored for fifth place may well be useful to us in our efforts to move up the @entity165 table			1

@entity0 won the @entity3 @entity2 to move 10 points clear of @entity1
it was the @entity70 's maiden victory at the @entity171 circuit
the @entity174 race was overshadowed by crash involving @entity8 's @entity7
