saved : @entity0 , 62 , became the first man in the world to receive a liver that was ' kept alive ' in a machine which mimics the human body @entity7 inventors have kept a human liver alive outside the body using a new device which mimics a human body			1
at the moment the organs can mostly only be used for transplants within 14 hours of being removed , if they are kept on ice			1
but by raising the liver to body temperature , and supplying it with red blood cells , oxygen and nutrients for up to 24 hours , @entity7 scientists have found a way of keeping the liver ‘ alive ’ outside the body			1
they say the procedure could double the number of organs available for transplant in the @entity7			1
@entity0 , 62 , thought he was going to run out of time on the organ donor waiting list			0
but he became the first man in the world to receive a liver that was ‘ kept alive ’ in a machine which mimics the human body			1
if kept cold , a liver can last a maximum of 20 hours , but in practice most surgeons will not wait more than 14 to avoid increasing deterioration			1
but the inventors of the new device say tests suggest it may keep a liver fresh for up to 72 hours in some cases			1
once connected to the machine , the liver functions normally and is less likely to suffer damage that might make it unfit for transplantation			2
the device is mounted on a supermarket - size trolley which can be wheeled into an ambulance ready to go anywhere a patient needs it			0
so far two patients at @entity54 , @entity55 , have had livers kept alive in this way and both are making excellent recoveries			2
but it is hoped the device will eventually double the number of liver transplants performed each year in the @entity7 , from 650 to well over 1,000			1
currently transplantation depends on preserving donor organs by putting them ‘ on ice ’ - cooling them to slow their metabolism			2
but the process may damage the organ , while others are discarded because of oxygen deprivation			2
it is currently difficult for surgeons to accurately identify organs that are failing to work properly			0
pioneering : the doctors from @entity54 and @entity77			0
the new machine raises the donated liver to body temperature and supplies it with red blood cells , oxygen and nutrients for up to 24 hours around one in 20 patients receiving a liver transplant may die as a result while 15 per cent have prolonged stays in hospital			1
by keeping the organ ticking over in the new device as if it ’s in a human body , doctors can test for defects before surgery and even resuscitate poorly functioning livers			1
the machine was invented by professor @entity99 of @entity77 ’s @entity100 , and professor @entity101 , director of the @entity102 , who are founders of @entity104 , the @entity77 spin - out created to develop the technology			0
prof @entity99 said ‘ these first clinical cases confirm that we can support human livers outside the body , keep them alive and functioning on our machine and then , hours later , successfully transplant them into a patient			1
’ he said it was an ‘ extraordinary feat of engineering ’ which is completely automated			0
once the liver is hooked up to the machine , the user simply presses two buttons for ‘ play ’ and ‘ stop ’			2
he said ‘ it was astounding to see an initially cold grey liver flushing with colour within 30 seconds once hooked up to our machine and performing as it would within the body			1
hope : experts say the procedure could double the number of organs available for transplant in the @entity7 ‘ what was even more amazing was to see the same liver transplanted into a patient who is now walking around			1
‘ whilst for these two transplants we only needed to keep the livers alive for up to 10 hours , in other experiments we have shown we can preserve a functioning liver and monitor its function outside the body for periods up to 24 hours			1
’ mr @entity0 , 62 , a father of five from @entity144 , @entity145 , was told last may he had only 12 - 18 months to live after being diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver - and it might take that long to get the right kind of organ			0
he said ‘ the waiting is horrible			0
you ’re waiting for the phone to ring , wondering ‘ are they ever going to call me ? are they ever going to call me ? ’			0
liver transplant surgeon , @entity156 , said the procedure maximises the chances of the recipient having a successful outcome ‘ i feel better than i ’ve felt for 10 - 15 years , even allowing for the pain and wound that ’s got to heal			2
i ’m getting better and better day by day			0
i just feel so alive ! ’ consultant liver transplant surgeon @entity156 performed both operations last month at @entity54			1
he said ‘ for the first time , we now have a device that is designed specifically to give us extra time to test the liver , to help maximise the chances of the recipient having a successful outcome			0
’ an initial trial of 20 patients is taking place at the hospital , with almost double that number signed up			2
prof friend , who has been working on the device for 15 years , said a @entity179 ce mark - a ‘ kitemark ’ of quality for medical devices - could be granted as early as next year enabling it to be used in @entity185 hospitals			0
the cost has not yet been decided			0
further trials involving 300 patients will test it against conventional treatment and see how much it can improve poor quality organs , he added			0
it might lead to the number of transplants doubling in the near future , he said			0
‘ transplant surgery is a victim of its own success with far more people needing transplants than there are donor organs available			2
‘ this device has the potential to change that situation radically			0
‘ by enabling us to transplant many organs that are unusable with current techniques , this technology could bring benefit to a large number of patients awaiting transplants , many of whom currently die whilst still waiting ’ he said			1
the @entity77 team believes the technology could be adapted to suit a range of other organs , other than the heart , including the pancreas , kidney , small bowel and lungs .			0

currently , organs must be kept on ice and used within 14 hours of removal
but new machine mimics the human body to keep the liver alive
technique supplies it with red blood cells , oxygen and nutrients
could double the number of organs available for transplant in the @entity7
