a murderer who walked out of an open prison more than 17 years ago remains on the run , police admitted last night			1
@entity4 , 57 , is one of 24 prisoners who are still missing after absconding from @entity6			1
but information about the killer , who was jailed for life in 1977 at @entity10 for murder , has only just been released			1
a murderer was allowed to walk out of @entity6 ( pictured ) before going on the run for 17 years his disappearance in 1997 came to light during an urgent police internal inquiry into a series of prisoners who ‘ slipped through the net ’			1
it was ordered by @entity23 police chief constable @entity22 after the @entity24 revealed one killer spent nine years on the run			1
@entity27 @entity26 , 53 , was even able to claim benefits , obtain a passport and even go overseas on holiday thanks to blundering police			1
he was only re-arrested after this newspaper exposed how he had fallen through cracks in the system after simply walking out of his jail			2
convicted murderer @entity26 ( pictured ) was able to claim benefits , obtain a passport and even go overseas on holiday thanks to blundering police the ensuing row forced @entity39 to review its failings and it found 24 other offenders remain on the run from the same prison			1
they include an array of dangerous criminals including violent attackers , drug traffickers , robbers , gunmen and fraudsters			0
details of those who escaped between 1992 and 2006 – 12 offenders , including @entity4 – had never been made public before			1
the oldest among these is @entity56 , 45 , who failed to return to prison from temporary leave on december 29 , 1992			0
he was serving a sentence for drug offences			0
other wanted criminals include @entity62 , 54 , who disappeared in 1995 after being jailed for drugs offences , and violent criminal @entity64 , 58 , who vanished in 1998			0
the recent discovery of the number of missing and potentially dangerous prisoners has been a serious embarrassment for police			1
some chiefs fear that many more may be found if forces with open prisons in their areas examine their historical records			1
privately , they blame a misunderstanding over who should take the lead in tracking down wanted inmates and inaction by the prison authorities			0
it is the force where the prison is located which is responsible for co-ordinating the manhunt , no matter where the prisoner is from or where his crime took place			0
it is the force where the prison is located which is responsible for co-ordinating the manhunt , no matter where the prisoner is from or where his crime took place yesterday , @entity94 was starting a further two - and - a - half year sentence after being told he may never be released			2
judge @entity97 branded his escape ‘ serious ’ and said it created ‘ harm and fear ’ among the public			0
speaking at @entity103 last friday , he said it would be for the @entity105 to decide if it would ever be safe to release him			0
he said : ‘ the sentence i have passed merely marks the offence you have committed and it does not indicate when it would be safe to release you ’ @entity94 was jailed for life in 1984 for hacking a teenage love rival to death and using his blood to write ‘ @entity116 ’ on the wall			0
but in 2005 , as he approached the end of his sentence , he walked out of @entity6 , in @entity23 , because he was fed up with waiting to be released			1
local police refused to accept responsibility for finding him and simply logged the fact he had absconded on a national database			2
as a result , @entity94 was able to start a new life , renting a flat near his frail parents , claim thousands in disability benefits and undertake odd jobs for elderly neighbours			0
shockingly , he even went to @entity132 on holiday where he robbed a post office and was jailed for three months , without anyone realising he was on the run			2
he was re-arrested in june in @entity103 by a team of @entity139 detectives who travelled to the @entity140 after being tipped off by this newspaper			0
the court heard that the authorities are still investigating how @entity94 , who is now held in a secure prison , was able to claim benefits and obtain a passport			0
his lawyer @entity147 said : ‘ the dangerous offender of many years ago is a far cry from the man who stands before you today			2
” @entity39 assistant chief constable @entity152 said the force is now doing ‘ everything possible ’ to trace the remaining missing men			2
he said : ‘ the men did not previously live in @entity23 and they committed offences elsewhere			1
they could now be anywhere , living under different names , which is why we ’re making this public appeal			0
