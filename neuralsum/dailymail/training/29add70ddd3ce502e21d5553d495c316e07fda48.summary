this pair of egrets have been pictured fighting over a fish in mid air in a national park in @entity12 photographer @entity16 captured the images despite the tussle only lasting ten seconds ' this winter most of the lake was frozen over , with only a little spot left for birds to catch fish , ' says @entity16 , of @entity31 , @entity17			1
' therefore the grey heron , great white egrets and the cormorants all had to come to the exact same spot if they wanted to get dinner			2
' this caused a lot of fights between the birds , and at the moment i captured these images one bird had managed to catch a fish			0
a lake in the park had been frozen over all winter , with the exception of one spot where the birds were fishing with so many birds competing for food in such as small space , @entity16 says there were regular food fights ' only he quickly had to then fight off all the other hungry birds who wanted to steal it from him for themselves			1

' i think this is the first step to positive things , because after seeing how beautiful nature can be people are more aware and are likely to respect it and preserve it			0
