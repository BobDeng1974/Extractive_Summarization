by @entity1 reporter published : 01:44 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 10:36 est , 1 october 2013 the @entity3 government shut down nearly all services this morning after @entity5 failed to strike a deal to fund public spending before the deadline expired at midnight			1
@entity9 has been locked in battle with the @entity11 , who insisted that they would not pass a bill to fund the government unless @entity15 agreed to delay the president 's signature healthcare reforms by a year			1
the @entity18 ordered non-essential services to stop operating shortly before midnight local time ( 5am bst ) , the first shutdown for more than 17 years			1
' it is a reminder to all of us that we need to have properly planned public expenditure systems , properly planned tax , properly planned arrangements for getting our deficit down , ” mr @entity33 said at the @entity44 conference in @entity45			1
' it is a risk to the world economy if the @entity3 ca n’t properly sort out its spending plans			1
' the @entity49 , which is controlled by @entity15 , refused to negotiate with the @entity25 - dominated @entity50 over ' @entity51 ' , which requires every @entity3 to buy health insurance or pay a fine			1
this lack of compromise means that nearly a million federal workers will go on unpaid leave until the two legislative bodies come to an agreement			0
critical functions such as air traffic control and military operations will continue , while the elderly will still receive @entity64 pension payments			2
too late : the funding for the federal government ended at midnight on monday when the 2013 fiscal year came to a close on guard : like all other departments of the federal government , the @entity18 will be operating with a smaller staff than usual during the shutdown what will happen during the shutdown ? all non-essential government services will close and their staff put on unpaid leave			1
more than 80 per cent of staff at bodies such as @entity81 and the @entity82 will be ' furloughed ' , but courts , the military and veterans ' affairs will remain functioning almost as normal			0
national parks and government - funded museums such as the @entity90 will be closed			1
@entity64 pension payments and the ' @entity51 ' health reforms will not be affected , because they are funded separately			1
what happens next ? democrats and @entity25 will return to the negotiating table - but since neither side has been willing to compromise so far , it is hard to predict when they will reach an agreement			0
the @entity18 insists it will not accept any delay to the implementation of @entity51 , the president 's main legislative achievement , which tea party @entity25 virulently oppose			1
the last shutdown , in 1996 , lasted 21 days - this one could be much shorter , or it could be even longer			2
what is the economic effect ? the shutdown is predicted to cost the @entity3 economy more than $ 1billion a day , according to @entity108 , thanks to the drop in output caused by federal workers staying at home , and the loss of tourism			2
why should people outside the @entity3 care ? @entity118 applications are expected to be delayed because consulate staff will not be paid , while officials currently involved in international trade negotiations will have to break off from talks			0
stock markets around the world fell on news of the shutdown			2
even more worryingly , the deadlock in @entity31 makes it less likely that politicians will be able to strike a deal to raise the @entity3 debt ceiling later this month - if the world 's biggest economy is forced to default on its debts , the world could be plunged into the worst economic crisis since the collapse of @entity138			1
however , national parks will be closed to visitors , most federal offices will shut , and even the @entity18 will be reduced to a skeleton staff			1
the federal government has shut down a number of times before , most recently under @entity146 in 1996 , but this incident is considered more serious because of the hyper - partisan atmosphere of @entity31 today , as well as the forthcoming fight over raising the debt ceiling to allow the @entity3 to borrow more money			1
@entity15 claim that the shutdown is entirely the fault of the @entity11 for refusing to accept the validity of @entity51 despite the president 's re-election last year , but @entity25 say the @entity15 failed to negotiate with them			1
stock markets fell yesterday on fears that the two sides would fail to reach agreement , and further losses are expected today			0
mr @entity9 this morning told members of the military in a video message that he would work to get @entity5 to re-open the government as soon as possible			1
the president said troops in uniform would remain on duty as usual			0
he said he had signed a law ensuring troops get paid on time			0
he said ongoing operations in @entity172 and elsewhere would continue and the @entity3 would ensure those in harm 's way would have what they need			2
as @entity5 reached deadlock , mr @entity9 said a ' shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people , right away , ' with hundreds of thousands of federal workers facing enforced absences and veterans ' centres , national parks , most of @entity81 and other government operations shuttered			1
he laid the blame at the feet of @entity11 , whom he accused of seeking to tie government funding to ideological demands , ' all to save face after making some impossible promises to the extreme right wing of their party '			0
house speaker @entity26 responded a short while later on the @entity18 floor			0
' the @entity3 people do n't want a shutdown and neither do i , ' he said			0
yet , he added , the new health care law ' is having a devastating impact ... something has to be done '			2
the stock market dropped on fears that political gridlock between the @entity18 and a @entity25 influenced by hardcore conservative tea party lawmakers would prevail , though analysts suggested significant damage to the national economy was unlikely unless a shutdown lasted more than a few days			1
faced with a government shutdown whose political implications are far from certain , @entity9 recorded a video message for @entity3 military personnel in which he avoided blaming the @entity25 , saying only that ' @entity5 has not fulfilled its responsibility ' the 1995 - 1996 federal government shutdown lasted a total of 28 days but left few economic scars as gdp growth skyrocketed after the government reopened			1
@entity25 are hoping the public remembers that the result was n't as apocalyptic as some had feared a few minutes before midnight , @entity18 budget director @entity227 issued a directive to federal agencies to ' execute plans for an orderly shutdown '			0
the @entity232 will continue processing foreign applications for visas , and embassies and consulates overseas will continue to provide services to @entity3 citizens			2
any interruption in federal funding would send divided government into territory unexplored in nearly two decades			0
then , republicans suffered grievous political damage and president @entity146 benefited from twin shutdowns in 1995 and 1996			2
now , some @entity25 said they feared a similar outcome			0
if nothing else , some republicans also conceded it was impossible to use funding legislation to squeeze concessions from the @entity18 on health care			2
' we ca n't win , ' said senator @entity254 , the 2008 @entity25 presidential candidate			0
tourists in the @entity3 , whether they are @entity3 or not , are likely to be seriously affected by the government shutdown			1
national parks such as @entity258 and @entity259 will be closed for as long as the shutdown continues , with anyone staying in campsites or on - site hotels forced to leave within two days			1
world - famous attractions such as the @entity265 , @entity267 's @entity266 and the @entity90 will also be closed to visitors until funding is restored			2
even @entity3 military cemeteries outside the @entity3 will be closed , as their operation is funded by the federal government			2
airports are expected to run as normal , as immigration , security and air traffic control are all considered to be essential services which continue to run no matter what			1
passport offices are supposed to stay open , but some are located within federal buildings which are otherwise closed			0
@entity118 applications could also be affected , but the @entity232 claims that as consular services are self - funding they will be able to continue			2
spin room : senator @entity285 is one of the top republicans pushing for @entity51 to be gutted and pressing to make it a condition of funding the government senate minority leader @entity290 said ' @entity3 do n't want a government shutdown and they do n't want @entity51 ' on a long day and night in the @entity32 , the @entity49 torpedoed one @entity25 attempt to tie government financing to changes in the health care law , referred to as @entity51			1
@entity18 @entity25 countered with a second despite unmistakable signs their unity was fraying - and @entity49 @entity15 promptly rejected it , as well			0
defiant still , @entity18 @entity25 decided to re-pass their earlier measure and simultaneously request negotiations with the @entity49 on a compromise			0
some aides conceded the move was largely designed to make sure that the formal paperwork was on the @entity49 's doorstep as the day ended			0
whatever its intent , senate majority leader @entity307 rejected it			0
they want to close government , ' he said of @entity18 republicans			0
as lawmakers squabbled , mr @entity9 spoke bluntly about @entity18 republicans			1
' you do n't get to extract a ransom for doing your job , for doing what you 're supposed to be doing anyway , or just because there 's a law there that you do n't like , ' he said			0
speaking of the health care law that undergoes a major expansion on tuesday , he said emphatically : ' that funding is already in place			0
you ca n't shut it down			0
' shares around the world fell today following the @entity3 government shutdown , amidst fears that @entity5 might fail to raise the nation 's borrowing limit later this month			1
in @entity36 , the @entity337 was down 22 points at 6,440 , while @entity340 's hang seng index tumbled 1.5 per cent and the dollar fell to its lowest level since february			0
yesterday the @entity343 fell 129 points , or 0.8 percent , to close at 15,129.67			0
the @entity345 500 slid or 0.6 percent , to 1,681.55 and the @entity347 composite dropped 10 points , to 3,771.48			0
while investors are clearly worried about the shutdown , which will depress the national economy by keeping government workers away from their desks , the damage is relatively small compared to the chaos which will follow if the debt ceiling is not lifted by mid-october .			1

@entity33 says the shutdown is a ' risk to the world economy '
republicans refused to authorise any more spending unless @entity5 delayed ' @entity51 ' health reforms by a year
but @entity15 would not negotiate over @entity9 's healthcare law
national parks and government offices will be shut but the military and essential services will continue
this is the first government shutdown since 1996
