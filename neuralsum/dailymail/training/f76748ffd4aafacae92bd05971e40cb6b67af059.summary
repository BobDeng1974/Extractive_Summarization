while many people will have their sights set on losing the extra pounds gained over @entity4 in 2015 , @entity1 's reporters have an entirely different list of @entity7 's resolutions			1
instead of letting us in on their personal plans , our experts have revealed what they 'd like to see happen in sport over the next 12 months			1
from moving the @entity14 semi-finals away from @entity15 to tougher laws on drug abuse , here 's some interesting ways to improve the sports we love			1
@entity21 the usual wishes : 1 ) a little less diving and play - acting from the grown men who still insist on cheating their fellow professionals			1
2 ) more opportunities for @entity27 players and coaches at the highest level			1
3 ) move the @entity14 semi-finals away from @entity15 and give them their own day , with no other football			1
@entity31 won last season 's @entity14 at @entity15 but @entity33 wants the semi-finals played elsewhere @entity35 i 'm proud supporters at my club @entity38 are leading the fight against the totally absurd cost of attending football matches - and i truly hope they win			1
the game is in grave danger of completely losing touch with its working - class base			1
a section of @entity38 fans hold up a banner to protest about ticket prices at @entity50 in october @entity51 can we stop writing off boxers if they are defeated once ? as @entity54 says , with half an eye on @entity56 : ' there is no shame in losing as long as you give it your all			1
the pity is when the best do n't fight each other			1
@entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 were all beaten but are still honoured as all - time greats in the @entity69			1
' @entity56 is undefeated in 47 fights but could face a tough test against @entity72 in 2015 @entity73 administrators to get serious about drug abuse in sport			2
a brilliant start would be to disband or reconfigure the @entity78 – a weedy organisation masquerading as a crusader			1
same goes for a number of governing bodies , who are long on lip - service and short on action			2
@entity86 @entity87 needs to get up to speed with modern demands and habits this coming year by making a decisive effort to cut out the amount of dead time in matches			2
some or all of the following areas need to be addressed and the recent @entity95 showed the way : time between points , net cords on serve , spurious toilet breaks , spurious call - ons for the physio , unnecessary warm - ups			2
separately , i would also like to see more money allocated to drug testing			2
i am more optimistic on both counts than for some time but will not be holding my breath			2
@entity109 wants tennis to be quicker in 2015 with physio call - ons only when truly necessary @entity112 my one wish for football – @entity115 to stand down as @entity117 president followed by a resignation of the entire @entity117 executive committee and an invitation to an organisation such as @entity122 to make proposals on how football governance should be restructured			0
@entity117 is a corrupt 20th century institution staggering on in the 21st century			0
the game is sick to its core – but the glitz and glamour is so beguiling we scarcely notice			0
@entity130 wants @entity117 president @entity115 to step down and the @entity117 executive committee to resign @entity132 let 's see an end to nasty , mindless sledging on the pitch in the wake of the @entity139 tragedy			0
play hard , yes , and certainly do n't hold back on bowling bouncers			0
but do we need to see so much of the snarling and foul - mouthed abuse which is on the increase in the game , which was even seen in the first test in @entity147 between @entity148 and @entity149 immediately after the terrible accident involving @entity139			0
the greatest cricketing theatre comes when a fast bowler stares at a batsman after a bouncer , like @entity155 used to , not aims mindless abuse at him			0
@entity132 hopes there is no more foul - mouthed abuse on cricket pitches around the world next year @entity161 for the @entity162 to prune the fixture list			0
the equation is simple – too many races , too few runners			0
the result has been a spate of poorly patronised meetings which have particularly blighted jump racing in the final few weeks of the year			0
the focus will be on @entity173 meetings in the opening @entity174 to see how well they are supported			0
the chances of my wish coming true ? on a par with @entity4 coming down my chimney !			0

footballers to stop diving and start acting like grown men would be good
more opportunities for @entity27 players and coaches would also be welcome
it is hoped @entity38 fans can win their fight against rising ticket prices
one writer calls for boxers to stop being written off after a single defeat
