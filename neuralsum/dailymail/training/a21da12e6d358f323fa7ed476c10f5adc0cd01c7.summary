by @entity0 and @entity1 a mother of two who lost her hands and feet and nearly her life after a silicone filler procedure went horribly wrong says she is a living example of what can happen when you put your life in the hands of rogue cosmetic surgery practitioners			1
@entity14 , from @entity15 , was a successful hair stylist who owned her own salon , but had always wanted to fix what she saw as her ‘ flaw ’ – her flat bottom			1
instead of a curvier behind , @entity14 was left in agony and eventually had to undergo 27 surgeries to have her buttocks , legs and arms amputated after a black market practitioner injected her with industrial grade silicone of the sort commonly used in bathroom sealant			1
‘ all i would ask them to do is , when you have that first thought , make sure they have a second thought about it and do a little research			2
and if they still want to do it , go for it , ' she told @entity57			0
' they wo n’t be blindsided , saying , “ oh , my @entity59 , i had no idea that a simple procedure like that can leave me with no hands , no feet and no butt cheeks			1
' " it is a growing problem , with the @entity66 warning that more and more people are putting their lives at risk by bypassing doctors just to save some money on basic medical procedures			1
in 2007 @entity14 was rushed to hospital , where surgeons discovered that a massive infection caused by the impure silicone had caused her body to go into severe shock ‘ i think that ’s awfully seductive to a person who does n’t know there ’s a problem , ’ said dr. @entity79 , a clinical professor of dermatology at the @entity81 , @entity82			1
at 47 , @entity14 has had to learn to do everything all over again with prosthetics and has learned to live on her own with the help of an aide who comes in to help her for a few hours a day			1
in recent years she has even competed in the @entity91 and while she does n't want people 's pity , she does want them to listen to her cautionary story			1
her problems began in 2005 when a woman claiming she could provide buttock injections walked into her salon			0
instead of telling her to leave , @entity14 , who says she always wanted bigger buttocks , was thrilled and immediately agreed to have the treatment			2
at first , everything seemed fine but just months after having the injections , the pain began			0
at 47 , @entity14 has had to learn to do everything all over again with prosthetics and in recent years she has even competed in the @entity105 ' they [ @entity14 's buttocks ] started to get hard , and then they started to get discoloured , ' she explains			1
' by 2006 , it was starting to itch and by 2007 , the pain started			0
' one thing about pain is that you ca n't turn it off			2
i could n't sleep , i could n't eat , i could n't even concentrate			2
' but things continued to get worse			0
'' i had gone to this party one saturday night and woke up sunday morning and thought " oh my @entity59 , @entity118 ! "			0
i just could n't pull myself together , ' she remembers			0
' that night was the roughest night of my life			0
i literally scratched all of the skin off my buttocks			0
my nails pulled all of the skin off my body			0
and when my sister came in , and she saw that , it freaked her out			0
' @entity14 was rushed to hospital , where surgeons discovered that a massive infection caused by the impure silicone had caused her body to go into severe shock			1
' the only end point on silicone injections is removal , ' explains the doctor who saved @entity14 's life , @entity140			1
despite the heavy price she paid for cheap surgery , @entity14 says that she 's recovering and is determined to enjoy the rest of her life instead of a curvier behind , @entity14 was left in agony and eventually had to undergo 27 surgeries to have her buttocks , legs and arms amputated ' removal when it 's not infected or removal when it is infected and about to kill you			1
' after a month in a coma , @entity14 awoke to a very different world			2
the drugs that saved @entity14 's life had diverted blood flow to her essential organs , keeping her heart beating and liver functioning as her body fought off the infection			1
but her hands and feet , starved of oxygen while the drugs did their work , had died			2
' i just moved the cover and i saw my right foot and i thought " oh my @entity59 " and it was that moment , that 's when it got real , ' remembers @entity14			1
' they were just black and swollen and necrotic and there was gangrene , and one [ of @entity118 's family members ] said : " just look at your hands " and i looked and that 's when it got really real			1
along with her buttocks , too damaged and infected from the injections to remain , her hands and feet had to be amputated			2
despite the heavy price she paid for cheap surgery , @entity14 says that she 's recovering and is determined to enjoy the rest of her life			1
' now it 's just my new normal , ' she explains			0
' now it 's just different			0
now i do n't just wake up and jump up on my legs , i wake up and snap on my prosthetics			0
gruesome : the damage to @entity14 's backside following the botched jab			2
her buttocks were later amputated ' the hands , that 's more challenging because you do n't really realise how much you do with them until you do n't have them			2
' she also hopes others will learn from her story and offers this advice to those contemplating surgery : ' do n't ever do anything without researching it and definitely do n't ever do anything on the black market			1
' it 's not about how you fall down			0
it 's not about making choices that are not catastrophic			0
it 's about knowing how to get up			0
' and the only thing that will ever make you feel better about yourself is feeling loved			1
that you are enough , no matter how it looks , what it is or how it feels , that it 's enough			0
