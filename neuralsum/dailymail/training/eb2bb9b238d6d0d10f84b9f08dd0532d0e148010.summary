by @entity0 for centuries only the light of @entity3 's red nose could guide @entity6 's sleigh , and perhaps that 's why he avoided being spotted for so long			1
but with the march of modern technology , it was only a matter of time before he was caught on film			0
finally he has been captured - by the thermal imaging camera of a police helicopter above @entity15			0
could it be ? @entity6 may visit the world 's population of seven billion in just one night , but the @entity20 police helicopter crew apparently managed to spot him doing his rounds above @entity15 the image , which the crew confirmed was a bit of fun @entity26 trickery , showed the legs of two reindeer the image was apparently taken at 1.44am on christmas day , a time consistent with when @entity30 might have reached the @entity31			1
it appears to show a contraption being pulled by at least two deer - or horse - like creatures			0
the photo prompted amusement after it was posted to the @entity39 feed of the @entity41 helicopter at @entity20 airfield , south of @entity15			0
the crew wrote : ' we picked up an unusual heat source on the last flight ? @entity6 ? could it be ? # 999crimbo ' chief constable of @entity49 seemed unfussed about the potential danger from a @entity51 , however			1
he tweeted : ' what a great heat source shot			1
thanks for getting # @entity6 round			2
' hoax : the image by the @entity31 police helicopter , pictured , prompted chuckles among @entity39 users amusing : this clearly photoshopped image by the @entity62 helicopter was a more obvious hoax @entity39 user @entity64 added : ' i was trying for four years in security to get an image of the big man on @entity69			1
' but not all were so positive			0
one , @ @entity71 , said : ' pull him for drink driving '			0
sadly , the crew have since confirmed it was a hoax created on @entity26 for fun			2
it is thought it may have been adapted from a colour image which was claimed to have been taken in @entity78 in october 1998			0
it came after the @entity62 's helicopter crew also took a few minutes out of their day for a @entity30 hoax			1
last night they posted a clearly manipulated photo showing a flying sleigh in front of their helicopter , with the @entity39 : ' @entity88 working well , according to the night crew			2

thermal image was apparently taken at 1.44am on @entity92
crew described it as an ' unusual heat source *...* @entity6 ? could it be ? '
sadly the photo was a hoax , as was an amusing shot by the @entity62
