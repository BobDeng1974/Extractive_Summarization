taking action : a controversial ingredient , brominated vegetable oil , is being removed from some @entity5 sports drinks the petition on @entity26 noted that the ingredient is linked to a flame retardant and is not approved for use in @entity30 or the @entity31			1
@entity32 said last year it would drop the ingredient from @entity6 in response to customer feedback			1
