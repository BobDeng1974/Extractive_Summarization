by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 world champion @entity2 will be keen to forget his 100th grand prix for @entity4			1
the @entity6 ’s season has been plagued by reliability issues and his bad luck struck once more in @entity9 when he was forced to retire after seven laps with engine gremlins			2
‘ come on , guys ! ’ a disgruntled @entity2 shouted over the team radio before reeling in his anger : ‘ i am sure you are trying everything , ’ he added			2
the @entity6 has scored just 45 points this season			0
at the same stage last year he had 107 to his name			0
frustration : @entity2 saw his 100th race for @entity4 end in an early retirement @entity25 actor @entity24 conducted the post-race interviews			1
it was the second time he has appeared on the rostrum this season after posing the questions in @entity31 , too			0
it means @entity24 , best known for his role in @entity37 drama @entity35 , has been on the top steps on more occasions than @entity2 this year			1
guest : @entity25 actor @entity24 conducted the post-race podium interviews @entity24 was among a host of celebrities who predictably flocked to the south of @entity46 for @entity48 ’s blue - riband event			1
@entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 spearheaded the @entity53 ’s assault on the principality while sir @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 were there from the world of show business			0
they were also joined by @entity61			0
the popstar , not deterred by an embarrassing snub from @entity64 on saturday , then posed for a rather awkward ‘ selfie ’ with @entity66 , 63 years his senior			0
snap : @entity67 singer @entity61 was one of a number of celebrities in attendance in @entity9 @entity71 registered their first points - scoring result in @entity48 after @entity74 finished ninth yesterday			1
the @entity76 - based team – who entered the sport as @entity79 in 2010 – completed the feat in their 83rd outing			2
@entity46 @entity74 actually finished eighth , but was demoted one place following a five - second timing penalty for serving an earlier penalty during the safety car period			0
hero : @entity74 finished ninth to score @entity71 's first ever points in their @entity48 history @entity71 ’s rivals @entity89 also secured the best result of their five - year history after @entity92 ended the race in 11th , but it is unlikely to dissuade owner @entity95 from ending his association with the team			1
the @entity99 chief , who watched his side bounce back to the @entity53 at @entity101 on saturday , is reportedly keen to sell up for a figure said to be in the region on £ 350million			0
cashing in : @entity99 owner @entity95 could sell his @entity89 team for a fee of around £ 350m @entity107 and @entity109 ’s spat should n’t deter from the remarkable effort by their @entity112 team this season			1
@entity9 ’s race was their fifth straight 1 - 2 finish – a feat a @entity119 - led @entity118 in 1992 , and @entity120 – in @entity121 and @entity122 in 1988 – were never able to achieve			1
can @entity112 win every race ? it ’s never been done before , but you would n’t back against them			2
streaking away : mercedes have won all six races this season , the last five with one - two finishes			0
