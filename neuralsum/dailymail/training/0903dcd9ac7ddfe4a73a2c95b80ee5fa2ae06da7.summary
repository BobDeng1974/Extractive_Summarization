@entity1 manager @entity0 admits it 's unrealistic to expect his side to catch unbeaten @entity4 at the top of the @entity6 any time soon but suggests comparisons between his ' @entity9 ' side and the current @entity11 team are far too premature			1
the @entity12 registered two wins last week , defeating @entity14 2 - 1 in the @entity15 before beating @entity16 2 - 0			2
however @entity0 's men remain nine points behind leaders @entity4 ahead of hosting @entity20 on saturday			1
' i believe it would not be realistic to just think now that we 'll catch back @entity4 very quickly			2
' we have to get consistent results to get a chance to come back			0
personally , i 'm more focused on the quality of our games and on the consistency of our results , before we think about coming back on @entity4			2
' @entity42 's side have started the @entity6 season unbeaten which has led to early comparisons with @entity1 's undefeated campaign of 2003 - 04			1
@entity1 forward @entity46 chases down the ball in training and will hope to score on saturday @entity49 evades the challenge of @entity51 in training ahead of hosting @entity20 on saturday @entity52 , back in the first team training after a sustained period out injured , wo n't feature on saturday @entity54 rolls out the ball in training as he hopes to keep a clean sheet at the @entity58 on saturday however @entity0 feels that is too premature : ' it is nine games played			1
there 's a long way to go			0
' @entity1 last won the league title back in 2004 but @entity0 maintains his side are still contenders			1
' i do n't write us off , let people do it , ' added @entity0			0
' that is a little bit linked with mathematics			0
it does n't consider who we 've played , how many times we played away , the quality of the team we played against , what missing players we had for the big games			0
' that is absolutely normal but i have a strong belief we will come back and we can just prove that on the pitch			0
@entity85 is hoping to make the starting line - up against @entity20 as @entity1 search for three points @entity89 and @entity90 prepare to defend a set piece in training on friday morning @entity94 and @entity1 defender @entity93 strikes the ball in training ahead of hosting @entity20 @entity97 hopes to get more playing time at @entity1 , with chances limited from the bench @entity101 concerned by @entity4 gap			1
