although @entity1 carried president @entity2 confidently into a second term last tuesday - not everyone is jumping for joy at the prospect of four more years			2
tens of thousands have put their names to secession petitions in 20 states , asking that they peacefully become independent from the rest of the country			2
the documents have been lodged on a government website @entity15 - and @entity16 has almost enough people behind its petition to warrant an official @entity20 response			1

so keen are the folks in @entity48 for a separation , that they filed their petition twice			0

@entity16 has gained the most so far with 23,000 people backing the wish to form an independent government			1
the right to petition the @entity1 government is guaranteed by the @entity62 of the @entity63			1

@entity53 conceded defeat in the presidential election last tuesday after the final count saw @entity2 with a total of 332 electoral college votes to @entity53 's 206			0
