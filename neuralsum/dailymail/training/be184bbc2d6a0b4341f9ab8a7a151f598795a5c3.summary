he was hunted and harried but finally @entity1 won the @entity3 @entity2 — his fourth consecutive victory and the one that finally put him on @entity7 table			1
back in the @entity9 home in the paddock , a seasoned observer in his red hat — @entity13 , the @entity9 chairman — was banging the table as he claimed in that direct @entity15 style of his that @entity1 is simply unbeatable			1
that proposition was mildly under threat in the closing few laps of the race as @entity20 , assisted by fresher , quicker tyres , came within six - tenths of a second of overtaking him			1
another couple of laps and he would probably have managed it			1
it provided a dramatic conclusion to a race that could best be described as a slow burner around the procession - inducing tarmac of @entity33			2
leader : @entity1 celebrates winning the @entity35 put him @entity7 table @entity1 was less than ecstatic , despite having established a three - point lead over @entity20 to lead the championship for the first time in nearly two years			1
‘ i was n’t fast enough today , ’ he said			2
’ @entity1 was being hard on himself ( as well as tetchy in some radio exchanges earlier )			1
but he deserved to win for being fractions better than @entity20 at the decisive moments of the weekend : in putting his car on pole and making the cleaner start to protect his advantage going into the first corner			1
@entity13 , contented after his team ’s fourth crushing one - two of the season , declared : ‘ @entity1 is unbeatable			1
because he ’s getting better and better every race			2
he makes no mistake whatsoever			2
he ’s got a strong personality			2
@entity20 tried every trick today to get him			1
and he did a good job , but he could n’t pass him			2
‘ @entity20 is aware at what level @entity1 is driving because they both drive the same car			1
and @entity20 will continue to fight , which for me is the most important thing			1
‘ because if @entity20 keeps on pushing himself to beat @entity1 , the big advantage is that both cars will go quicker			1
so i ’m in a very comfortable situation — outstanding by @entity1 and @entity20 trying to catch up			1
’ in form : @entity1 edged out @entity20 and @entity66 to win his fourth race in a row @entity13 was not finished			1
‘ my strategy is very simple			2
we do not interfere with who is winning what			2
we let our drivers drive from beginning to the end			2
so far nothing bad has happened			2
if there is no third driver in championship contention then i ’m completely relaxed			2
‘ then they can drive over each other , and whoever is surviving is the world champion			0
but we ’re not there yet			0
when we are , it ’s really going to be warfare			0
’ is it ? how nasty it all gets depends to some degree on @entity20 being able to match @entity1 more regularly than he has this season			1
if he fails to do that in the next few races , starting in @entity94 in a fortnight , @entity1 ’s dominance may prove unstoppable			1
@entity20 said : ‘ i was n’t close enough to give it a go ( attempt to pass @entity1 )			1
next lap i would have been			0
so i am a bit gutted			0
but , still , it was second place , i am close in the championship and there are many more races to go			0
‘ the start was poor			0
it ’s a bit of a weakness at the moment			0
but there are a lot of positives to take and i am fully motivated			0
’ impressive : @entity9 chairman has labelled @entity1 unbeatable following his run of wins @entity9 ’ team hegemony certainly remains unshaken by the three - week break and the move to the @entity119 stretch of the season			1
the @entity9 cars were more than 49 seconds ahead of @entity66 ’s @entity122 in third place , though he was delayed at the start by the @entity125 of @entity126			0
the true gap is six - tenths of a second a lap , according to @entity122 team principal @entity129			0
some people questioned @entity1 ’s move from @entity132 to @entity9 for 2013			1
however , he rightly detected their potential as a ‘ super team ’ in embryo			0
@entity132 , on the other hand , had lost @entity9 as partners and had not then done a deal with @entity139 — an arrangement that comes into effect next season			0
‘ i feel truly blessed to be part of this team , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it is just unreal			0
’ close run : @entity20 was disappointed not to get closer to @entity1 in the @entity3 gp the disparity between @entity9 and @entity132 was clear yesterday as @entity148 and @entity149 were lapped comprehensively			1
that is intolerable for a team of @entity132 ’s stature			0
@entity153 also suffered , with @entity154 being lapped			0
they were at least saved from the further humiliation of @entity157 suffering the same fate on his home track in front of his adoring fans			0
the drive of the day probably belonged to @entity122 ’s world champion @entity163			0
he started 15th after being penalised for a gearbox failure , yet carved his way up to fourth			0
his boss , @entity129 , knows better than most about dominating a season , or several			0
asked if he thought @entity9 would win all 19 races , he said : ‘ possible but improbable			0
’ comeback trail : @entity163 finished fourth after starting the day in 15th			0

@entity1 *lauded* by @entity13 after run of wins continues
but @entity1 *insists* he can still improve his speed
@entity20 confident he can still provide a *challenge* for @entity1
