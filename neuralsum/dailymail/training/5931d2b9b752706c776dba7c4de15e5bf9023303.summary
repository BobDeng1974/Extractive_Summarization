by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , the company which makes @entity4 , is the world 's biggest buyer of hazelnut and may be forced to increase product prices due to the nut shortage the price of @entity4 could be on the rise due to a global shortage of hazelnuts caused by a washout of crops following bad weather			1
the cost of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60 per cent already this year after hail storms and frost obliterated crops in @entity22 , where about 70 per cent of the world ’s hazelnuts are harvested			1
it has resulted in a stark increase in the wholesale price of the nut , which has risen to £ 6,300 ( $ 10,500 ) per tonne from just £ 3,900 ( $ 6,500 ) per tonne in february			1
while the extent of the damage to the hazelnut flowers on @entity22 ’s @entity35 coast is not yet fully evident , it is feared about 300,000 tonnes of the crop could have been damaged in march ’s poor weather			1
it comes after continued warnings about the rising cost of cocoa which has continued to soar as demand outstrips production			0
experts have warned that a growing taste for chocolate in @entity47 – particularly in @entity48 – means cocoa farmers will need more help to provide a greater amount to export or manufacturers will be forced to use less cocoa in their products			2
it is feared the rising demand could become unsustainable by 2020 , unless more is done to help cocoa growing communities			0
the threat of a global shortage of both cocoa and hazelnuts comes as bad news for chocolate makers – many of whom combine the ingredients for their products			1
@entity68 , a trader at @entity70 - based @entity69 , said the rising price of the nut was a worry for market leaders			2
the price of hazelnuts has risen from £ 3,900 per tonne in february to £ 6,300 per tonne this month ( file picture ) he told @entity79 : ‘ buyers are living hand to mouth			1
some people had contracts already [ pre-dating the frost ] and they are not going to get them			0
‘ a lot of people are still uncovered in the market and people that thought they were covered are now in the market again			0
’ it is especially a worry for @entity4 , which claims to contain more than 50 hazelnuts per every 400g jar			0
@entity4 currently costs between £ 1.75 and £ 2.25 in major @entity97 supermarkets but may well face an increase if the price of hazelnuts continues to rise			1
according to the @entity102 , @entity2 - the company which makes and owns @entity101 and @entity4 – is the world ’s biggest buyer of hazelnuts , using 25 % of the world 's supply			2
last month , @entity108 - based @entity2 confirmed it had bought @entity22 company @entity110 - one of the world leaders in the production and marketing of hazelnuts			1
in a statement , the @entity115 - based @entity2 gave no financial details but said @entity118 had five production plants exporting to the @entity120 and other important markets			0
@entity122 , which also makes a range of nut - related chocolate bars including its @entity126 bar , may also have to look into addressing prices of its products to reflect the rising ingredient costs			2
however , @entity132 - based @entity131 – the company which owns @entity122 - declined to comment on whether it had plans to increase the price of its products			0
@entity1 has contacted @entity2 for comment .			0

price of hazelnuts has risen from £ 3,900 per tonne in february to £ 6,300
it comes after hail storms and frost obliterated hazelnut crops in @entity22
comes as bad news for chocolate - makers as price of cocoa is also on rise
