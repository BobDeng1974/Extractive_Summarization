by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 02:05 est , 25 october 2012 when council officials visited residents at a tower block to reassure them about a temperamental lift , there was only one way to do it			1
unfortunately , the show of faith by the six occupants - including a pregnant woman - backfired when they got stuck a couple of floors from the top			2
after much fruitless jabbing of buttons , an emergency call was put through to firefighters to come to their aid			2
@entity20 - faced : the fire brigade had to be called when council officials got stuck in a lift on their way to convince residents of its safety now they 'll listen : residents at @entity29 - listed @entity28 had made numerous complaints about the lift the fire crew tried to wedge the lift open at @entity28 in @entity33 , @entity34 , and shouted suggestions to those inside			1
meanwhile , red - faced colleagues on the other side of the doors made frantic phone calls to check those imprisoned in the lift were all right			1
but the farce deepened when it suddenly sprang back into life , carrying the delegation down to the ground floor and then back up to the 12th floor			0
are you alright in there ? colleagues made frantic phone calls to communicate with the trapped officials at this point the doors opened , allowing the five council officials and an @entity55 safety officer to scramble out after 30 - minutes of drama			1
the group took to the stairs to complete their trip to see residents as part of a community safety event			0
the irony of the situation was not lost those living in the @entity29 - listed building , who have made numerous complaints about the lift breaking down			1
@entity70 , 30 , who lives there with her five - year - old son , @entity72 , said : ‘ we have put up with this all the time so it ’s good for the council to see first - hand what it ’s like			1
‘ it ’s a total nightmare			0
my mum is disabled , so she struggles to get to me when the lifts are n’t working			0
’ another resident , a woman in her 50s , added : ‘ you have to laugh as you really could n’t make it up			0
‘ at least now these people can see what we have to put up with			0
’ the firefighters tried to wedge the doors , but eventually the lift descended and they opened of their own accord @entity92 had invited residents of the tower block - which has 14 habitable floors lifted 40ft into the air on massive concrete stilts - to come to a meeting on tuesday to discuss problems , including anti-social behaviour and the troublesome lifts			1
when no one showed up - probably because they were scared they would n’t make it - the officials decided to seek out residents themselves			2
the council yesterday said refurbishment work had now begun on the one of the lifts			2
the other one is due to be updated in february			0
a spokesman added : ‘ fortunately , what goes up must come down			0
the problem was quickly resolved and did not disrupt the main event			0
‘ however , it did give council officers first - hand evidence of how much the lift improvements are needed and how much it will benefit local residents of @entity119 .			1
