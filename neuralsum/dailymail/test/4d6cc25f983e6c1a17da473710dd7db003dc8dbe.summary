it 's a classic @entity1 saying : ' g'day mate , how you going ? '			1
but when one @entity1 traveller tried to get @entity6 's to repeat it , many were lost for words			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 in @entity10 , recently spent months travelling across the @entity6 , and documented his interactions with locals all around the country			2
from a homeless man who was insistent upon telling his story about @entity17 , to a man who insisted @entity8 was saying ' get out of my nightgown ' , the filmmaker captured it all			1
' i do n't even know what he said ! ' exclaimed one @entity30 when asked by the @entity9 man to repeat the phrase			2
' say it again in @entity47 ? ' , asked a man in @entity49 , @entity50			2
' @entity52 to me man , ' he later added			0
many people threw strange sideways glances at the man , trying to understand what he was saying , with one man declaring ' that 's @entity59 ! '			0
others erupted into fits of laughter as they tried to translate the classic @entity1 vernacular , and @entity8 also ran into one very talkative man intent on repeating he used to live in the back of @entity17 ' dads house			1
this @entity50 said ' sounds @entity52 to me man ' , when speaking to the @entity9 man one man in @entity69 responded with an incomprehensible sentence while trying his hand at the @entity1 accent this man , who did n't quite get the gist of the question , was insistent on telling a story about @entity17 ' i lived in the back , of @entity17 ' dads house ' , the man , who appears to be homeless , told the filmaker over and over again			1
when he was asked again to repeat the phrase after @entity8 , he simply said : ' all right '			1
while on the subway @entity8 asked one man to repeat what he said , but he simply declared ' ca n't do it '			1
' i do n't know what you said , were those words ? ' one woman , who appeared to be at a sporting event , asked the @entity1			0
' what the hell 'd you say ? ' exclaimed one hog hunter in @entity30			0
kids giggled as they tried to understand what @entity8 was saying in his @entity1 accent many times the filmmaker was met with strange glances from confused @entity6 children were n't much better and translating the popular @entity1 phrase , but the best of the bunch came from a shirtless man in @entity29 , @entity30			1
' wait i got this , ' the man said while surrounded by his friends before triumphantly proclaiming : ' get out my nightgown ! '			0
' that 's the one			0
i got it right , i already know i got it , ' the man said			0
@entity8 even managed to stump a speech therapist who struggled to understand the @entity1 accent			0
the video , aptly titled ' @entity116 : the sequel ' can be viewed in full on @entity8 's @entity119 page .			2

@entity8 asked @entity6 to repeat ' g'day mate , how you going ? '
some were lost for words , while others *dissolved* into fits of laughter
one man was convinced @entity8 was saying ' get out of my nightgown '
another was insistent on telling his story about @entity17
the video is the second of it 's kind which asks *foreigners* to repeat phrase
