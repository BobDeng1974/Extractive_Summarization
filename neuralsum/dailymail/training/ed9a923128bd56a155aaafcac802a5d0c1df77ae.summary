by @entity0 for the past two weeks i ’ve been working away from home			1
i ’ve been at ‘ the fashions ’ , as a colleague ’s young son calls the bi-annual catwalk shows of @entity7 and @entity8			1
it ’s written in my contract that i attend these runway collections , it ’s business and i am obliged to be away			0
this means my husband is in sole charge of the four children , aged two to 11			2
it ’s mr @entity18 ’s turn in the hot seat at air - traffic control : he ’s wrestling with the dreaded domestic to - do list alone			0
@entity0 : should i be worried ? should i quit my job and stay within a five - mile radius of the kitchen to safeguard my marriage ? will everyone survive the triple school - run to get in on time ? will homework get done , hair get brushed , uniforms washed and hamsters fed ? will veggies get eaten and fizzy drinks be rationed ? will he leave me when i get back ? this week i ’ve learnt that apparently modern men resent being used as ‘ daddy day care ’			1
according to some they dislike it so much they hot - foot it out of a relationship , join internet dating sites and reveal their best body part is ‘ their bum ’			1
at least that seems to be the consensus of judgmental opinion i ’ve read on the recent split between tv presenter @entity50 and her partner of 16 years @entity51 ( the man with the good bum )			1
columnists gleefully appeared to collude in the ridiculous view that it just was n’t on for a working mum to expect her partner to take on equal childcare			0
how dare @entity50 tackle a tough commute to work at @entity62 , devote further time to training for @entity65 , and then expect @entity51 to be responsible for their three boys in her absence , the commentators crooned , as the news that @entity51 was single and looking for love online broke			1
they concluded @entity51 left because he resented his temporary role as house husband , that being the primary carer is really the woman ’s job			2
this kind of thinking is illogical			0
equal parenting is indisputably the most efficient way of organising childcare when both parents choose to or need to work			2
none of us know the reason @entity84 and her partner parted ( it ’s none of our business frankly ) but to blame her career for the split is nonsensical			0
at least that seems to be the consensus of judgmental opinion i 've read on the recent split between tv presenter @entity50 and her partner of 16 years @entity51 ( the man with the good bum )			1
so should i be worried ? should i quit my job and stay within a five - mile radius of the kitchen to safeguard my marriage ? it never crosses my mind — as i head for the airport for my short business trips and hand over control of the fearsome foursome — that mr @entity18 may then feel the need to exchange me for a less demanding model			0
can he cope in my absence ? of course he can , he is a man not a pot plant ( no one asks if i ’m going to be able to cope when he goes away for work , no one thinks i ’ll resent the responsibility )			1
he is n’t any less capable just because he has n’t got a womb or his hair is shorter than mine			0
in fact , he seems to enjoy his rare mum - free existences			0
when i get home the little fellas have all but made ‘ daddy does it best ’ badges			1
he does n’t parent the way i do given his haphazard time - keeping — with mr @entity18 routine is suspended , bedtimes are flexible , baths negotiable and the toddler often goes out in her @entity136 bottoms instead of her leggings — but that ’s half the fun for the children			0
they adapt to his way of doing things and i silence my inner control freak to overlook the fact they have probably had @entity147 pizza for tea three days in a row			0
i have n’t been ‘ lucky ’ as some imply when they witness mr @entity18 ’s willingness to help out , i ’ve been logical			2
we knew children would be hard work so we defined a way of doing it we think works for us			0
logic with a lot of love thrown in			0
and on the plus side , my husband revels in the ‘ superhero ’ status bestowed on him by some of the other mums while i am away			1
‘ he ’s so good , is n’t he ? ’ one mum once said to me as if his appearance at the playground was as rare as a @entity171 ’s black card			2
‘ he ’s just a man , ’ i replied , ‘ doing the school run			2
’ @entity0 is editor in chief of @entity176 .			1

modern men resent being used as ‘ daddy day care ’
@entity0 *afraid* going on 2 week work trip would cause husband to leave
is @entity50 *'s* recent split to do with her being the *breadwinner* ?
