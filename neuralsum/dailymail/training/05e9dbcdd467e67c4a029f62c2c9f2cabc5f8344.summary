@entity8 came into the game still searching for a first away win of the season , but they started the brighter and were rewarded with the opening goal in the eighth minute , although it came about largely due to their opponents ' defensive shortcomings			0
@entity0 struck four times for @entity2 as they hammered @entity8 7 - 2 on saturday the @entity9 celebrate after a reversing a two - goal deficit at half - time at @entity32 @entity2 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity18 , @entity35 ( @entity36 46 ' ) , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 79 ' ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 84 ' ) , @entity17 , @entity0 , @entity43 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 goals : @entity50 ' @entity8 : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 56 ' ) , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 74 ' ) , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 84 ' ) subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 booked : @entity63 goals : @entity71 ' referee : @entity73 attendance : 17,015 @entity37 , who was under pressure from @entity62 , got involved in a mix - up with @entity33 , with the ball ricocheting off the goalkeeper 's body and back to @entity80 , who kept his composure to fire home			1
the @entity9 , who had already gone close through an @entity18 header , missed a good chance to equalise soon after when @entity17 put the ball wide from close range after good link - up play with fellow strikers @entity0 and @entity43			1
thereafter , @entity2 controlled possession and territory for the most part as they probed to get back on terms			0
goalkeeper @entity94 was extended a couple of times by strikes from @entity98 and @entity0 , but the visitors were defending resolutely , remaining organised and three minutes before the break they went 2 - 0			0
the @entity9 failed to react as @entity61 attacked the right side of the penalty area before cutting inside and hitting a low cross-shot which was n't dealt with , @entity63 made a real hash of his first effort but he still had the time to recompose himself and fire the ball into the back of the net			0
@entity80 ( right ) celebrates after putting @entity8 ahead in the first half @entity63 ( right ) then doubled the @entity112 lead before the break @entity0 of @entity2 halved the defecit for the home side shortly after after half time he then put the @entity9 3 - 2 ahead after @entity43 had levelled proceedings it is fair to assume @entity9 head coach @entity118 had some harsh words for his side at the interval but it is also reasonable to suggest he did not expect the reaction he got			1
within seven second - half minutes , the home side were back on terms as @entity0 tapped home a @entity38 centre from close range in the 47th minute before @entity43 equalised five minutes later when he glanced home a @entity39 corner			2

@entity139 of @entity2 ( second right ) then scored his side 's fifth after @entity17 had grabbed the fourth @entity0 celebrating his hat - trick goal to make it 6 - 2 before going on to add his fourth and @entity2 's seventh @entity8 were utterly shell - shocked and in the 66th minute they conceded a fifth , @entity18 applying the finish after a @entity43 header from a corner rebounded off a post			1
again an assist from the woodwork following a @entity43 strike allowed @entity0 to complete his hat - trick in the 77th minute as the ball cannoned into the net off his chest			0
