by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 13:06 est , 2 september 2013 an @entity2 woman has conceived using eggs grown in ovarian tissue which was transplanted into her abdomen			1
the woman , known only as @entity7 , was rendered infertile by treatment for ovarian cancer			1
however , thanks to the pioneering treatment , she is now 26 weeks pregnant with twins			1
the team later transplanted the frozen tissue into her abdomen allowing her to produce two healthy eggs			2
this is the first time that a woman has conceived after having ovarian tissue removed and then replaced in a different part of her body			1
however , @entity7 ’s fertility doctor , associate professor @entity39 , warns that it has taken many years of treatment and almost daily procedures to achieve the conception			2
she told the age : ‘ when it happened i think we all had a good cry together really			0
never once did she waver and tell us it was too hard and she wanted to give up			0
’ however , associate professor @entity49 says that it is very exciting that it has now been proved that ovarian tissue can function outside of the pelvis			2
this is the first time that a woman has become pregnant after having ovarian tissue removed and then transplanted into a different part of her body when she was being treated for cancer , keyhole surgery was performed to take a sample of @entity7 ’s ovarian tissue from her non-cancerous ovary			1
seven years later , the tissue was transplanted onto the wall of her abdomen			0
after months of hormone treatment , the tissue produced follicles and two eggs			0
these eggs were both fertilised and implanted into her womb			0
@entity7 had keyhole surgery to remove some tissue from her non-cancerous ovary			1
this was frozen and then , seven years later , transplanted into her abdomen where it produced two healthy eggs the @entity24 now hopes to set up a centre at which it could collect and store tissue from women with conditions that could make them infertile			1
the hospital has already collected samples from about 300 such patients			0
@entity93 , the international medical director of @entity94 , which did the first successful @entity2 ovarian tissue transplant , told the age : ‘ it makes me quite convinced that the optimal way for preserving fertility will be taking ovarian tissue			0
‘ if i had a patient who was going to lose their fertility to cancer treatment i would offer it from now on			0
