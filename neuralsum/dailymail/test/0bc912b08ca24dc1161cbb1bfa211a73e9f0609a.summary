@entity0 have fought all season to try to secure a return to the @entity3 , but six players shown the exit door at @entity6 are in the competition 's final four			2
last season 's disastrous campaign under @entity10 saw @entity0 miss out on @entity12 's premier competition for the first time in 19 years , with @entity14 and @entity16 members of the failing squad			0
but those two - plus @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 - have all made the semi-finals in their former club 's absence from the competition			1
@entity16 scored the winner for @entity28 against @entity29			2
he is on loan from @entity0 @entity14 was part of @entity10 ' failing side last season but he now plays for @entity35 side @entity34 @entity16 and @entity18 combined for @entity28 's winner against @entity29 on wednesday night , with the former only on loan and deemed surplus to requirements by @entity39 who has instead relied on misfiring @entity41			1
meanwhile , @entity19 was leading the line for @entity34 , with @entity14 at left back , in their 0 - 0 draw against @entity44 that won a place in the last four			0
@entity20 is out with a thigh injury but could return in the time for the semi-finals next month			0
finally , @entity21 is enjoying one of the best seasons of his career at centre back for @entity52 and helped keep out @entity54 's fearsome attack that featured @entity55 and @entity56 on tuesday night			2
@entity18 has gone from strength to strength since leaving @entity0 and is in the last four once again @entity19 went to @entity59 between his stints with @entity0 and @entity34 , who beat @entity44 whatever happens in the semi-finals , there will be at least one former @entity6 representative at the @entity3 final in @entity68 's @entity67 on may 6			1
@entity0 are on course for a return to @entity12 's top table next season , with their position inside the @entity73 's top four looking fairly safe ahead of @entity74 who sit eight points behind			0
but for now , the @entity3 semi-finals are the home of their former players , rather than their current ones			0
@entity21 spent time at @entity0 between two spells with @entity52 , and he is in the semi-finals with them @entity20 was released by the @entity6 club after spending his youth there and plays for @entity34 now			1

@entity0 have six *ex-players* in @entity3 semi-finals
@entity16 scored the winner for @entity28 against @entity29
@entity20 , @entity19 and @entity14 play for @entity35 side @entity34
@entity18 set up @entity16 's goal for @entity28 on wednesday
@entity52 's @entity21 helped keep out @entity54
@entity16 was the hero for @entity28 but he will need to find a new home
