during the lengthy inquest into @entity3 ’s dismal performance at last summer ’s @entity4 , @entity0 reflected on a team that had been roughed up at the highest level			1
@entity3 were bullied off the ball in the opening two games against @entity9 and @entity10 , showing too much respect for the opposition			1
his team had been intimidated by @entity15 , second best to every ball , as @entity3 were dumped out of the @entity4 after just six days			1
@entity15 bullied and dumped @entity3 out of the @entity4 after just six days in @entity17 @entity0 's side had been intimidated by @entity15 in their @entity20 defeat at the @entity21 weeks after the tournament , at a debrief with @entity3 ’s coaches , @entity0 told his staff that they would go back to basics for the @entity28 qualification campaign			1
the old - school , @entity30 mentality was to make a return and for all the right reasons			0
@entity0 wanted @entity3 to be difficult to beat again			1
he spoke with assistant manager @entity34 and coach @entity35 , telling them he wanted his new @entity3 team to have a more muscular presence on the pitch			2
@entity0 and @entity35 had discussions on how they could have a more muscular presence on the pitch the head coach wanted his team to be stronger , to concentrate on the physical characteristics of the game again after those humbling defeats against @entity9 and @entity10 , plus the dead rubber against @entity49 in @entity50			1
@entity0 was convinced his team had gone soft , playing to the gallery as the nation demanded a side that could keep possession and stamp their personality on games in the same way as @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 or @entity61			2
the outcome , after @entity0 ( right ) claimed he wanted to ‘ bottle what i ’m seeing ’ during their pre-tournament training camp at @entity66 in @entity67 , was elimination from the @entity4			2
although @entity0 wanted his team to be slick and to pass the ball with purpose , he vowed that the rough would go with the smooth for the final two years of his contract			2
in november , when @entity3 renewed their rivalry with @entity76 at @entity77 , the coaching staff agreed unanimously that they emerged from the physical confrontation with the upper hand			2
@entity0 has introduced the tenacious qualities of @entity82 midfielder @entity81 to the team , encouraging him to make the meaty challenges in the centre of the park			1
@entity0 wanted to add some extra steel to his @entity3 squad and it game in the form of @entity81 @entity81 has impressed for @entity3 since making his debut for @entity3 against @entity92 in @entity93 ‘ i do like a tackle , ’ he admitted on sunday as @entity3 continued their preparations for the prestige friendly against @entity9 on tuesday			1
less than a year ago , when @entity3 played the @entity98 in the opening @entity4 group game in @entity100 , @entity0 ’s defence could not lay a glove on the @entity9			1
the test for this team , with this new rugged approach , is to travel to @entity106 and secure a result with a depleted team against a side ranked 10th in the world			0
@entity111 was named @entity3 captain and has is eager to please @entity0 and his new strategy @entity111 was in the team against @entity9 last summer , out on the left in the @entity4 opener as @entity0 attempted to accommodate @entity117 forward @entity118			1
everyone has learned a lesson from that			0
the @entity3 captain is comfortable with the new approach , eager to please the manager after adopting a new strategy			2
so far , with seven successive victories since they exited the @entity4 , it has worked			0
@entity111 and @entity3 have enjoyed six successive victories since bowing out of the @entity4 with a whimper @entity111 said : ‘ you do n’t want to go into games with teams enjoying playing against you , you want teams to look at @entity3 and think , “ we know we have a tough game			1
it is going to be physically hard against them , we are going to have to defend and we are going to have to be good on the ball to keep the ball ”			0
‘ it ’s maybe not so much nasty , but being aggressive			0
not in a bad way in terms of we are putting really hard tackles in , but we are getting up to the ball quickly , we are harrying teams and making them make mistakes			0
at the minute we have the tactics right			0
’ on tuesday , when the players take the field in @entity106 , they will be met with the uncompromising @entity150 trio of @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 in their favoured 3 - 5 - 2 formation			0
on tuesday @entity3 face @entity4 opposition @entity9 again as @entity0 's side travel to @entity106 ‘ @entity9 will be very good on the ball and there will be times when they are able to play out so we have to make sure we pick our moments right and not get picked off , ’ added @entity111			1
‘ it is moving in a good direction			0
we are learning with every game since the @entity4 , we are getting better and there is an excitement back about @entity3			0
’ it is a bit early for that , but at least they have made a fresh start .			0
