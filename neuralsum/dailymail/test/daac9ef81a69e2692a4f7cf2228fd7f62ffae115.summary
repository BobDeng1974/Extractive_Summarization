he is accused of being involved in a plot to fix lower league football matches @entity8 ( right ) celebrates after scoring for @entity28 in the @entity2 in 2003 opening the @entity31 's case against both @entity8 and @entity32 at the start of a three - week trial , prosecutor @entity29 told jurors they would not need to know anything about football to try the defendants			1
mr @entity29 told the jury panel : ' @entity39 in this case is really nothing more than a means to an end - it 's an opportunity to make money			0
' it 's described sometimes as the beautiful game but football has an ugly side to it as well , and it 's that ugly side we are going to be looking at			0
' after explaining to jurors that match - fixers @entity52 and @entity54 were found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery at a previous trial , mr @entity29 alleged that @entity21 was one of the players they had tried to corrupt			1
@entity52 and @entity54 , both from the @entity61 , were at the centre of the conspiracy , the court heard , having travelled to @entity64 with the specific purpose of fixing matches			2
defendant @entity21 ( right ) on the ball during an @entity69 match between @entity70 and @entity28 in 2010 @entity31 alleges that the plot - which aimed to profit from rigged bets - targeted the lower leagues because of the high level of scrutiny surrounding the @entity2			1
@entity21 played at a semi-professional level between 2009 and 2014 , including stints with @entity79 - based @entity78 and @entity81 club @entity80			1
jurors were also given details of @entity8 's career , which included a spell at @entity70 in which he earned around Â£ 65,000 during the 2010/11 season			0
describing @entity8 's alleged role in the conspiracy , mr @entity29 added : ' he was a middleman , a fixer			2
he was somebody who cast his net around to find players who might be willing to take part in match - fixing			1
' by the time of the alleged conspiracy in november 2013 , mr @entity29 told the court , @entity8 was earning considerably less than previously			2
' that may well have been his motivation , the prosecution say , for what took place , ' mr @entity29 said of @entity8 's reduced income			0
@entity8 ( top ) in action for @entity15 during a match against @entity107 in march 2004 informing jurors that another footballer , former @entity80 defender @entity109 , was also found guilty at a previous trial , mr @entity29 said there was no doubt that an agreement to fix lower league matches occurred			1
' this case is not about whether this scheme existed , ' the prosecutor told the jury			0
' the issue for you to decide is whether you are sure that firstly , @entity8 , and secondly @entity21 , was a part of that agreement			2
' this case is focused on them and what they did , and why they did it			0
' @entity8 , from @entity127 , @entity128 , and 25 - year - old @entity21 , of @entity129 , @entity130 , south @entity79 , deny conspiring together with others to commit bribery between november 1 and 27 , 2013			1
mr @entity29 said betting on football was not confined to the @entity2 and extended from the very top of the sport down to semi-professional leagues			0
lower league games in the @entity138 had been targeted , mr @entity29 claimed , partly because highly - paid professionals would have to be offered ' astronomical ' sums to even think about becoming involved in corruption			0
@entity128 's @entity8 ( left ) vies with @entity143 's @entity142 during an old @entity145 match in 2002 the conspiracy came to the attention of the @entity148 after initial inquiries by a private investigator who wanted to expose match - fixing led to the identification of @entity153			1
a national newspaper then became involved , the court was told , and @entity52 arrived in the @entity64 in november 2013			0
during a meeting with an undercover investigator on november 16 , @entity52 is alleged to have made unsuccessful attempts to contact footballers and made reference to an agent named @entity8 who used to play for @entity28			2
at that point , the court heard , the @entity148 took over the investigation , deploying a covert officer to gather evidence			0
the officer met @entity52 five days later and mobile phones belonging to the defendants , including @entity8 , were subsequently seized			0
mr @entity29 will continue his opening speech to the jury on tuesday			0
