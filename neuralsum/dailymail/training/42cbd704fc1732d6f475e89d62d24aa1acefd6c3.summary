by @entity0 for @entity1 a cargo spacecraft purposefully sent to burn up in @entity4 's atmosphere has been captured in an amazing image from a resident @entity7 astronaut			1
last friday the vehicle called @entity9 left the station full of rubbish to be disposed of when it re-entered @entity4 ’s atmosphere yesterday			1
and the stunning spectacle of fire was spotted from above in a rare photo of its kind by @entity19 astronaut @entity18			1
the cargo spacecraft is purposefully sent to burn up with trash on board the commercial cargo ship ended its month - long space station visit last week			1
@entity9 is a free - flying spacecraft developed by @entity30 under @entity33 's @entity32 programme			2
the spacecraft consists of a @entity35 ( @entity36 ) and a @entity37 ( @entity37 )			0
the @entity36 carries pressurised cargo and experiments to the space station and pressurised disposal cargo away from the station for destructive reentry at the end of the mission			2
the @entity37 provides power , propulsion , guidance , computation , and communications for @entity9			0
astronauts aboard the @entity7 released the @entity9 supply ship full of trash for disposal			1
they parted company 260 miles ( 420km ) above @entity57 's southwest coast			0
and @entity18 , by training his camera down towards @entity4 , was able to spot the moment the spacecraft was torn apart above the @entity62 by the intense force of re-entering our planet 's atmosphere			1
' in 84 days [ @entity67 ] , [ @entity68 ] and i will ride home inside such an amazing fireball ! ' @entity18 wrote on @entity72 , referring to their return to @entity4 in november this year on a @entity76 spacecraft , albeit with a less destructive descent			2
the automated @entity9 craft is used to take cargo to the iss but unlike other vehicles like @entity83 's @entity82 or the @entity84 @entity76 , it is not able to return to @entity4			2
instead , like @entity19 's own @entity86 ( @entity86 ) , it is designed to burn up in @entity4 's atmosphere after leaving the station			1
and astronauts use this opportunity to fill the vehicle with waste from the @entity7 to be disposed of			2
the automated @entity9 spacecraft departed the @entity7 last friday having brought more than 3,000 pounds ( 1,400 kilograms ) of crucial cargo to the station last month @entity9 is designed and operated by @entity97 - based @entity96 , with this particular vehicle launching from @entity97 in mid-july under a @entity33 contract			1
the unmanned craft hauled more than 3,000 pounds ( 1,400 kilograms ) of crucial cargo to the orbiting outpost			0
when it left it was loaded with 3,500 pounds ( 1,600 kilograms ) worth of rubbish			0
' all the best wishes , ' @entity18 radioed to the company 's flight controllers			0
@entity9 does not have a heat shield that can survive re-entry so when it hits the atmosphere it is torn apart , with the intense heat setting fire to the various components			1
re-entry is targeted over unpopulated areas of @entity4 such as the @entity62 in this instance @entity9 ( shown ) is designed and operated by @entity97 - based @entity96 , with this particular vehicle launching from @entity97 in mid-july under a @entity33 contract on sunday @entity30 steered the craft down through the atmosphere to burn up , with the six space station astronauts recording the fiery re-entry for engineering analysis			1
the same documentation will be done when a @entity123 atv supply ship departs early next year			0
that ship , launched from @entity125 , delivered its shipment a few days before @entity9 left			0
@entity33 and its international partners - @entity84 , @entity123 , @entity128 and @entity129 - want to learn as much about atmospheric re-entry as possible to prepare for the space station 's eventual demise in the decade or two ahead			0
@entity30 is one of two @entity135 companies hired by @entity33 to deliver space station goods			0
the other , @entity137 - based @entity83 , will make its next supply run on 19 september .			0

@entity140 @entity18 has captured a stunning photo on the @entity7
@entity19 astronaut spotted the @entity9 spacecraft burning up in the atmosphere over the @entity62
event *occurred* yesterday after @entity9 had departed the station last friday
the cargo vehicle is purposefully burnt up with trash on board after leaving
and the rare photo shows how it *disintegrates* *due* to the intense forces and high *temperatures* at play
