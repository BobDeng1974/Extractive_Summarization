they are moments that ' never existed ' but the subjects are as real as it gets in the latest works from @entity5 photographer @entity4 , who has merged cityscapes from around the world at different times of the day into single , deceptive images			1
@entity4 , 45 , visited cities including @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and his home town @entity16 for the project which aims to show them in a different light			1
' i am always fascinated by urban landscapes , the temper , the hustle of them , the energy , and of course the constant transformation that takes place , ' @entity4 says			2
in @entity11 , @entity30 , street lights reflect off the water while the traditional houses are in daylight in @entity4 's unique images @entity4 , 45 of @entity16 , splices together pictures from both day and night in @entity36 in @entity37 a composite image taken a various times of the day on the outskirts of @entity12 , @entity41 ' not only the obvious transformations , such as new buildings , but the change that occurs within minutes in an urban surrounding			1
' i have compressed the complex perception of urban existence into one single image			0
' @entity4 describes his composite images of the same frame at different times of the day , and even days apart , as a ' new moment '			2
' this new moment never really existed , but it looks somehow familiar to the viewer , ' he adds			0
' only at second glance do we realise that not all is as it seems , questioning our common photographic perception			0
' each image takes 15 to 20 hours to complete , with @entity4 spending about three hours researching the location that will best show - off his technique			2
actual shooting time is about five hours across various periods of the day but he uses the photo editing software @entity64 and @entity65			0
@entity4 says : ' people 's reactions range from " i do n't get it " to " brilliant " and " unbelievable "			1
the @entity69 in @entity37 is captured in the work from @entity4 which can take up to 20 hours to produce a single shot shrubs bath in sunlight in the @entity74 in @entity37 while the skyscrapers of the city are illuminated at night rather than shooting recognisable landmarks , @entity4 is more fascinated by urban landscapes such as this in @entity14 's @entity81 district the movement of the hustle and bustle of @entity85 in @entity14 is shown in this composite of several photographs by @entity4 the time of day is blurred in the @entity89 in @entity14 above a busy road ' i have trained my skills for some years now , and after having figured how to use them for this project the work itself is n't difficult at all , it is actually fun ! ' the difficulties are more in calculating how the course of time affects the final image			1
' for example , a scene that looks nice during daytime may get very boring at dawn , because of closed shop - windows			0
' so , most of the locations must be examined and scouted way before the shooting itself takes place			0
' @entity4 looks at a busy street and stalls from a humble but handy walkway that helps pedestrians over traffic in @entity89 ' people 's reactions range from " i do n't get it " to " brilliant " and " unbelievable " , ' says @entity4 of works such as this in @entity85 , @entity14 a regular convenience store takes centre stage as cars , bikes and people come and go in @entity127 , @entity14 a composite image of @entity129 in the @entity130 of @entity131 , @entity13 @entity37 's @entity132 in one of the images @entity4 describes as a ' new moment ' behind the glittering veneer of @entity37 , @entity4 chooses dilapidated apartments in @entity36 as his subject bins and graffiti feature in this @entity141 of @entity131 scene in a ' new moment never really existed , but looks somehow familiar ' people swoop through the shot in @entity131 's @entity146 ( north of @entity147 ) with blue sky and the street lights of the night a single cloud blotches the sky above this residential area of @entity13 's @entity141 not exactly the bright lights of @entity154 , @entity155 , but an intriguing and original take on this urban complex 's transformation over time @entity4 included a host of works from his home city of @entity16 , @entity5 a cruise ship on a dry dock gets the day and night treatment in the harbour city of @entity16 a building under construction provides a source of intrigue for @entity4 in @entity16 a train appears to speed over this cafe in @entity16 where it would look to be night time were it not for the sky			1
