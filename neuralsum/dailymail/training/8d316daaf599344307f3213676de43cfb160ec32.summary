by @entity0 published : 17:40 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 3 august 2013 top of the class : sixth formers who achieve the best a-level results will have extra cause for celebration tens of thousands of school leavers with good a-levels face missing out on top universities , which are rejecting applicants with grades lower than @entity12 sixth - formers receiving their results in a fortnight will be divided into a two - tier clearing system			1
those with the highest grades will find a large number of places in a range of courses on offer			2
but those with grades equivalent to @entity28 or less will find undergraduate offers severely restricted , a @entity25 survey has found			1
students who miss out will have to settle for courses at less prestigious universities or put their lives on hold while they resit exams or take a gap year			1
in previous years , universities have been limited in the number of students with top grades that they can take			1
this provided an opportunity for lower grade students to get in			0
however , this restriction has now been dropped and the prestigious universities have been told they can take as many students as they like with grades of @entity12 and above			1
competition for places is intense as grade inflation means around 27 per cent of a-level candidates got a or a * grades last year and around half were awarded bs			1
elite universities including @entity55 and @entity56 have already stated they will not take part in clearing			0
but other prestigious @entity60 institutions have confirmed they are looking to harvest top students through the system			2
the @entity63 said it wanted ‘ as many suitably qualified applicants as possible ’			0
the @entity65 said it was ‘ looking to recruit high quality students through adjustment and clearing this year ’			0
two tier : tens of thousands of sixth formers face missing out on their first choice of university after the rules governing how many top students could be accepted were relaxed @entity75 has said it is ‘ definitely ’ taking part in clearing and @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 recently indicated they were likely to have places available			1
@entity85 , deputy secretary general of the @entity86 , said : ‘ there is a concern that universities will not be able to accept applicants on some courses who just miss getting an @entity12 , when in previous years they might have been able to accommodate them			2
‘ this is why it is so important that students have an insurance offer that actually gives them a safety net			0
' about 40 per cent of students last year went for second choices that needed at least the same grades as their first choice			0
these are the students who are going to be in a muddle			0
’ a @entity106 spokesman said : ‘ if an applicant does not meet the conditions of their offer , acceptance is at the discretion of the institution			0
’ @entity115 pickings : sixth formers who pass their a-levels with top marks will have a wide range of courses to choose from at the very best universities			2

undergraduate offers will be severely restricted , the @entity25 has found
students who miss out will have to settle for places at lesser universities
universities were *capped* on amount of @entity132 students they could take
this rule has been *scrapped* *increasing* competition for top spots
