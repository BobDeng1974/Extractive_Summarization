by @entity1 reporter published : 23:12 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 18 june 2013 excited members of an expedition in @entity4 believe they may have found the underwater grave of the @entity6 , the first @entity8 ship to traverse the upper @entity9 before disappearing mysteriously 334 years ago			1
divers this weekend opened a pit at the base of a wooden beam that juts nearly 11 feet from the bottom of @entity16 , believing it could be a section of the vessel , the rest presumably entombed in mud			1
they picked up the pace monday with more powerful equipment after a weekend of probing showed that whatever is buried is deeper than sonar readings indicated			0
@entity25 and @entity26 experts insist it is too early to say whether there 's a shipwreck - let alone the @entity6			1
but anticipation is building at the prospect of solving a maritime puzzle that 's more than three centuries old			2
' after we get done for the day , everybody calls or comes to the house and they 're like , " what did you find ? what did you see ? can you tell me anything ? " ' said local commercial fisherman @entity61 in an interview sunday aboard his ship , the @entity64 , which holds crucial expedition equipment , including ' umbilical ' cables that supply oxygen to divers			1
' people are really interested and they 're excited to see what it is			0
' his neighbors are n't the only curious ones			0
the roughly 40 - member expedition team consists of archaeologists , historians , boat pilots , divers , an underwater salvage crew and assorted helpers			2
when not on the water , they stay in cottages and tents by the lake in the unincorporated village of @entity90 , in one of the most remote corners of @entity4 's @entity93			2
some are relatives or longtime friends of mission chief @entity96 , who has sought the ship for three decades			2
while researching the @entity6 long ago , @entity96 ran across @entity98 , a @entity99 sheet - metal worker whose grandfather had searched the lake for chests of gold that legend says smugglers lost during the @entity106			1
' i came up here one year to witness what @entity96 was doing , and i asked if i could dive with him , ' said @entity98 , 54			0
' been doing it ever since			0
... i 've never met anyone as good at research as him , and he 's a very ethical guy			0
if he says it 's the @entity6 , i absolutely believe him			1
' others have come aboard more recently , including three archaeologists from @entity26 who arrived over the weekend			2
explorer : the @entity6 was built on orders of legendary @entity26 explorer @entity48 , who was not on board when the ship disappeared wreck : crews are digging a pit at the base of a beam in @entity16 to see if it 's attached to a buried ship the hands - on excavation work is being handled by a three - man crew from @entity128 , a @entity4 company that ordinarily deals with mundane tasks : repairing pumps or scraping zebra mussels off intake pipes			1
' we 're basically underwater janitors , ' said @entity135 , vice president of operations			0
the @entity6 , he said , is ' like a play job for us			2
' the team has had to adjust its strategy , as the excavation is proving to be a bigger - than - expected challenge			0
sonar scans in years past had suggested that an object similar to the @entity6 's reputed size rested about 2 feet beneath the lake floor			1
but commercial divers on friday found the bottom caked with a thick layer of invasive , fingernail - size quagga mussel shells			2
after tunneling through mussels , the divers began sucking away gravel and sediments , never hitting anything solid			0
by sunday night , the hole reached about 8 feet below the lake bed and it was n't clear how far down the wooden beam extended or what it might be attached to , said @entity159 , the project manager			1
but as more is exposed , the post appears increasingly likely to be part of a ship , said @entity163 , director of @entity26 's @entity164			1
' we never saw a timber standing like this one , ' he said			0
' so it 's impossible to imagine it otherwise , so one can expect that there is a hull			0
' play : excited actors who in 1976 re-enacted @entity48 's journey across the @entity9 and down the @entity173 , reunited in @entity90 , @entity4 , near the @entity6 's potential shipwreck archaeologists @entity175 , of @entity178 , @entity179 , and @entity180 , of @entity181 , @entity4 , sit on the @entity64 and sift through material that was found in the sediment , watching for artifacts , from bronze cannons to axes or knives - ' anything man - made ' that would help identify a ship , @entity175 said			1
thus far , the only candidate has been a slab of blackened wood about 15 inches long with characteristics suggesting it might have been fashioned by human hands			0
visitors inspired by the long - lost ship have drifted into the area during the search , including a 9 - year - old who wrote a school paper about the @entity6 and men in period costumes and handmade canoes who in 1976 re-enacted @entity48 's journey across the @entity9 and down the @entity173			1
@entity207 , a folk singer and self - described ' pretty - soon major movie star ' who lives 90 minutes north on @entity209 , performed an impromptu concert outside the food tent sunday night			0
he said he 's composing a song about the @entity6			1
' it 's rattling around in my head , ' he said .			0

divers are exploring the area around a wooden beam at the lake 's bottom
some believe the beam is part of the @entity6 , built by legendary @entity26 explorer @entity48
the @entity6 disappeared in 1679 after being the first @entity8 ship to traverse the upper @entity9
experts say its too soon to tell if the beam is part of a ship
