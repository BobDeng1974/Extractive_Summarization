by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 8 july 2013 crazy : home secretary @entity2 told the @entity3 today that the government would act to curb access to benefits , court appeals and legal aid for terror suspects terror suspects and hate preachers will be stripped of their benefits , @entity2 told the @entity3 yesterday			1
that was one of a series of lessons the home secretary vowed to learn from the twelve - year battle to deport @entity17 , whose family have received more than £ 500,000 since he arrived in @entity19			1
the home secretary was cheered by @entity20 as she confirmed that the fanatic had finally been put on a plane to @entity23			1
she told the @entity24 that work and pensions secretary @entity25 was already examining ‘ how we can curtail the benefits claims made by terror suspects and extremists whose behaviour is not conducive to the public good ’			2
hook - handed cleric @entity32 cost the taxpayer £ 338,000 before he was extradited to the @entity34 last october and fellow hate - preacher @entity35 , who gloated at the murder of drummer @entity37 , pockets an estimated £ 26,000 a year in benefits			2
mrs may said she was determined to tackle the ‘ crazy interpretation of our @entity42 laws ’ that had allowed @entity44 to frustrate the deportation process for so long			2
she said that the saga had cost taxpayers £ 1.7million			2
‘ that is not acceptable to the public , and it ’s not acceptable to me , ’ she added			2
‘ we must make sure it never happens again			2
‘ i have made clear my view that in the end the @entity55 must be scrapped			0
’ she said that the forthcoming immigration @entity59 would make it easier to remove foreign nationals and reduce their ability to prolong the process with ‘ spurious appeals ’			1
the government has been trying to deport him to @entity23 , where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999 , for about a decade mrs may also suggested she wanted to curb the availability of vast sums in legal aid that funded @entity44 ’s battle to avoid deportation			1
she said that around £ 430,000 of @entity44 ’s legal fees were paid by the taxpayer , while many other foreign nationals the government is trying to remove have their legal costs paid in full by the public			1
@entity81 mp @entity80 suggested mrs may should go further and deport @entity44 ’s wife and five children			0
mr @entity80 said : ‘ it is indefensible that he and his family were able to claim benefits for so long , and disappointing they were not on the plane with him			0
’ mrs may replied : ‘ they will have a decision to make about where they see their future			0
’ but mrs may reserved her fiercest criticism for the @entity97 , which she accused of ‘ moving the goalposts ’			0
‘ we must also consider our relationship with the @entity97 very carefully , and i believe that all options – including withdrawing from the @entity102 altogether – should remain on the table , ’ she said			0
mrs may had been criticised by some conservative mps for deferring to @entity97 judgments			0
yesterday she affirmed she had been right to do so , but acknowledged @entity44 would have been deported ‘ long ago ’ had the court not established ‘ new , unprecedented legal grounds ’ to block it			1
@entity44 was only deported after @entity19 negotiated a treaty with @entity23 guaranteeing that he would not be subjected to torture and evidence obtained by torture would not be used against him			1
he has been charged with plotting @entity114 - inspired terror attacks and detained in a prison in @entity23 ’s capital @entity117			1
charges faced by @entity44 relate to a foiled plot against the @entity34 school in @entity117 and an alleged attack on @entity122 and @entity34 tourists during @entity124 celebrations			0
leaving : @entity44 was seen smirking from the window of the plane as it left @entity19 in the early hours of sunday radical @entity127 cleric @entity17 sits in the backseat of a police car outside the state security court in @entity117 sheikh @entity131 spoke out against @entity44 's deportation radical cleric @entity17 's deportation has placed @entity19 at risk from furious @entity135 who ' never forget ' , hate preacher @entity131 warned today			1
@entity131 , who himself is barred from @entity19 , said @entity17 's hardline supporters will blame ordinary @entity19 citizens if he comes to any harm in @entity23 where he 's currently being held on terror charges			1
and he claimed the deportation was a ' violation of @entity44 's human rights '			0
speaking from his @entity144 bolthole , @entity131 raged : ' because of foreign policy @entity135 see no difference between the @entity147 and the @entity19 people now			0
' @entity135 will hold the @entity19 people responsible for whatever happens to him			0
they never forget and in the future they will come face - to - face			0

*applause* in the @entity3 as @entity2 tells @entity156 is in @entity23
tells of ' *quiet* *satisfaction* ' that a *dangerous* man has been deported
*pledges* curbs on access to legal aid , court appeals and state *handouts*
