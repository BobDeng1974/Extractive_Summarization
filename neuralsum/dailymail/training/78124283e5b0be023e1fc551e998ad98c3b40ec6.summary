by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 13:01 est , 18 november 2012 tragic : @entity1 and @entity2 lost their daughter @entity3 after failings by @entity7 staff which led to the baby being born in a midwifery unit rather than a hospital the death of a newborn baby could have been avoided if the child had been born in a hospital rather than a midwives unit , an inquest has ruled			1
a couple slammed the @entity7 after losing their tiny daughter just six hours after she was born , claiming she should have had better treatment			0
@entity20 died on march 1 , 2009 , after suffering from a rare pregnancy condition in which blood leaks from the foetus into the mother			1
her mother @entity2 , 38 , a technical writer from @entity27 , @entity28 , suffered complications in the last month of her pregnancy which lead to a series of hospital trips and tests			1
just two hours after being born at @entity34 , tiny @entity3 suffered a collapse and was flown by the @entity36 to @entity37 where she died at 4.05pm the same day			1
on friday , an inquest jury at @entity39 unanimously concluded that the baby would have survived if she had been delivered elsewhere , and the decision by clinicians to treat mrs @entity2 ' pregnancy as low risk contributed to @entity3 's death			1
mrs @entity2 and her husband mr @entity1 , who got married in december last year , described the care given to @entity3 as ' a complete and utter catastrophe ' , and say everything which could have gone wrong did			2
speaking after the inquest , mrs @entity2 said : ' lessons must be learned and change implemented to ensure no other family has to endure what we have been through			1
' throughout my pregnancy and @entity3 's birth we , as a family , have been let down by the various organisations within the @entity7			2
' knowing what we know now i would never have consented to have given birth at @entity27 maternity unit			2
' we have grave concerns about the quality of midwifery care that @entity3 received after her birth			0
' following the inquest we now know that she was left alone in a cold cot in a hypothermic state with signs of respiratory distress by a midwife who was meant to be caring for her			0
' that image haunts us			0
' mr @entity1 , a professional photographer , told @entity76 : ' the hospital trust were , and are responsible for the death of our daughter			2
anger : @entity34 where @entity2 gave birth to her daughter @entity3 ' the questions we have been battling to get answered for three years and eight months have finally been answered by a unanimous jury verdict			1
' after the inquest , @entity87 , head of midwifery and deputy centre chief for the women and children 's centre at @entity92 , said : ' we will now be taking the time to reflect on the jury 's findings			0
' @entity97 , of @entity98 , the family 's solicitor , told the newspaper : ' lessons must be learnt , but it is of critical importance that mothers - to - be are fully informed and give full and informed consent			0
' the inquest also heard of a catalogue of transportation failings in rushing the couple to be with their dying daughter			0
@entity112 refused to treat @entity3 's mother as a priority , and told her she may have to wait up to four hours to be transported to be with her dying daughter			1
a happier time : @entity2 , of @entity27 , @entity28 , pictured in her 36th week of pregnancy , just five weeks prior to the birth of her baby @entity119 who died after a collapse not wanting to be separated , mrs @entity2 and her husband @entity1 , 42 , decided to drive themselves to @entity124 to find @entity3 and attempted to follow the helicopter by car			1
but during the journey , the new mother collapsed from an acute stress reaction , and an emergency ambulance had to be called which , instead of taking her to @entity124 , transferred her to @entity132 instead			2
photographer mr @entity1 eventually found out where @entity3 was being treated having rung around multiple hospitals in the @entity135 desperately trying to find her			0
he arrived just in time to hold her for the last five minutes of her life , but mrs @entity2 did not reach her until 90 minutes after she died			1
dr @entity138 , medical director for the @entity112 , commented in a report to the family : ' logistical and procedural issues within @entity112 led to an unsatisfactory experience for this family at a time of great difficulty for them			2
' in response to this statement mr @entity1 said : ' if one flies with a budget airline one might have an unsatisfactory experience			0
' but the fact that it took 58 minutes from the 999 call being made to @entity3 arriving at @entity154 , where she died in my arms , makes this comment grossly inappropriate			0
' a spokesperson for @entity112 later claimed they did everything they could to save baby @entity3			1
spokesman @entity162 said : ' the inquest has shown that the care provided by the ambulance crew and the doctor and paramedic on the air ambulance was appropriate and they did everything they could to get @entity3 to @entity154 in @entity124 , a @entity173 neonatal unit , in the shortest possible time			1
' but yesterday , mr @entity1 said he was disgusted with the response the grieving family received from the @entity112			2
he said : ' the ambulance service said the flight time for the air ambulance to get @entity3 to @entity154 was just 15 minutes			1
intimate : @entity2 just moments after the birth of her baby daughter on march 1 at @entity34			1
@entity3 died on the same day after she was airlifted to hospital			0
' but the inquest heard the actual time from departure to arrival was 58 minutes			0
' it 's clear to us that by their response they are still in denial that their actions contributed to the suffering of our daughter			0
' ultimately ... my daughter would only be alive today if the clinicians from the @entity198 and @entity199 had listened to mine and my wife 's concerns about our baby , both before she was delivered and immediately following her birth			0

mother @entity2 , 38 , had suffered complications during pregnancy
@entity216 suffered a collapse two hours after her birth and was *whisked* to hospital by air ambulance
