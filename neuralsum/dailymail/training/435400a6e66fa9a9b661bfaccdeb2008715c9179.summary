a bright , articulate @entity1 student jumped to her death after battling an anxiety disorder which her mother fears was triggered by years of bullying			1
an inquest heard @entity7 , who wanted to be a clinical psychologist or a vet , masked her symptoms for three years before taking her own life in june in @entity12 , @entity13			1
her mother @entity14 said her daughter was ' systematically and horrendously abused ' by bullies since the age of 14 , but bottled up the devastating emotional consequences			1
tragedy : @entity7 , 17 , battled an anxiety disorder for three years before taking her own life speaking after the inquest @entity7 's mother , who has worked as a mental health nurse for 20 years , said : ' the bullying was a significant factor in @entity7 's mental illness - prior to that she had a normal childhood normal upbringing			1
' the experts said she was systematically and horrendously abused by bullying but she internalised it			2
in my view , without the bullying she would not have developed mental health issues and she would not have died			2
' the therapist said the bullying was systematic but we could never get to the bottom of it			2
there was no report from school because they did n't know anything about her troubles because she just absorbed it and took it on the chin rather fire back at anyone			2
' she maybe took that torment on herself until the point came when she became really unwell with it			2
the bullying had stopped by that time but the damage was already done			0
we tried to talk to her about what happened but it was too painful for her			0
' the inquest yesterday heard @entity7 , from @entity59 , @entity13 , began displaying mental health issues in 2011 which were first put down to ' social anxiety '			1
@entity63 : the teenager wanted to go to university and dreamed of being a psychologist or vet she was later diagnosed with a psychosis - like personality disorder , and eventually told her mother @entity14 about her bullying ordeal			1
doctors prescribed medication but the teenager ' did n't want to be reminded that she was unwell ' , the inquest heard , and developed insecurities about being admitted to a psychiatric unit			1
she self - harmed , including on one occasion in a public toilet , and police were called out when she was found standing near railway bridges and viaducts			0
last june @entity7 was due to be interviewed as a volunteer on the mental health and children 's wards at @entity87 ahead of applying to university			1
her mother 's final words to her were to wish her good luck			2
but instead of attending the hospital , she walked to a car park in nearby @entity12			0
@entity94 spent half an hour trying to talk @entity7 down , but she jumped from a ledge			1
he said : ' she would n't let me come to her			0
it was impossible to try and grab her			0
' the teenager , who was studying maths , chemistry , biology and psychology a-levels at @entity104 , suffered fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at @entity87			0
a suicide note was found on her laptop			0
the inquest heard @entity7 had been seen by several psychologists and had been to hospital many times			1
dr @entity112 said he saw @entity7 six days before she died , adding : ' she was wearing make up and fashionable clothing , and seemed happy			1
' she seemed interested in the reform of her diagnosis and we discussed how treatment and recovery were possible			0
' she explained she did not enjoy her recent hospital admission in an adult ward and her intention to avoid further admissions			0
' but @entity7 's mental health worker @entity123 said : ' @entity7 had the intelligence to be able to work out what people wanted her to say and project that image			1
' @entity7 's mother told the inquest : ' i always had a gut feeling that one day she would n't be with us			1
' i 've waited for that phonecall or knock on the door			0
i kind of saw it that if she did not get the help she needed , one day that would be inevitable			0
coroner @entity140 told the inquest at @entity142 ( pictured ) : ' @entity7 was a very intelligent and clearly articulate young lady , a young lady who had a personality disorder ' ' it is very difficult to cure a mental health problem and @entity7 kept a lot to herself and tried to manage it very much herself			1
because she tried to manage it herself , she ended up in crisis a lot of time when she wanted to kill herself			2
sometimes she lacked insight into how low her mood was			0
' ' @entity7 was good at masking things and would try and mask her symptoms so people would think she was okay			1
i did air my concerns and said i found it hard to judge that risk			0
' it was really inconsistent			0
her behaviour had become erratic			0
she would try and mask it and put make - up on and present as very cheery			0
' @entity7 's death has already prompted the launch of a charity in her memory , @entity171 , to help young people with mental health issues			1
it also prompted a petition and protest march supported by thousands calling for action to make the site where @entity7 died ' safe or knock it down '			2
coroner @entity140 told the inquest at @entity142 : ' @entity7 was a very intelligent and clearly articulate young lady , a young lady who had a personality disorder which seemed to have various diagnosis at various times			1
' clearly @entity7 's mother , working in mental health had some insight into problems and appropriate help was sought at an early stage			1
' it seems to me that the nature of @entity7 's mental health and her intelligence and insight into it always meant it was always going to be a very difficult situation to manage			2
' he recorded a verdict of suicide			0
