@entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes @entity2 will play a crucial role in his side 's unlikely push for a @entity7 place after another starring role in saturday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity10			1
north - east native @entity2 lashed home the @entity1 ' 29th minute equaliser at the @entity13 seven minutes after @entity14 put the @entity10 in front following a controversial penalty award			1
@entity16 kept the @entity1 flying high in fourth place in the table and prompted boss @entity19 to hail @entity2 as ' the best player on the pitch by far			1
' @entity2 is congratulated by @entity1 team - mate @entity0 after scoring his side 's equaliser @entity2 scored his side 's all - important equaliser against @entity10 in the 29th minute @entity2 's excellent run of form saw him recalled to the @entity29 squad for the first time in four years last month and @entity0 said on his club 's official website : ' when he plays like this , good things can happen for him			1
' i think @entity2 is a very good player			1
he 's been back in the national team , and we have to help him do his job very well			2
we 've seen what 's happened for him and it 's a pleasure to play with him			0
' @entity19 was happy enough with a point although his side rode their luck after misfiring @entity10 striker @entity44 produced an extraordinary miss in first - half injury time to keep the score level			2
and @entity1 defender @entity48 was also lucky to avoid giving away a second spot - kick midway through the second period when he clearly handled a cross from @entity52 - though @entity19 predictably insisted the offence was ' not intentional '			2
@entity2 played against @entity54 after being recalled to @entity56 's @entity29 squad @entity19 added : ' i am always happy with a point away from home in this division because it 's not easy where ever you go			1
we showed character and it is the third time we 've had to come from behind in the last three games			0
' @entity19 's insistence that @entity10 midfielder @entity68 had ' dived ' to win his first half penalty did not improve the mood of @entity10 boss @entity71 who conceded his side is facing a tough winter after yet again turning a winnable game into a draw			2
@entity71 cut a disconsolate figure in the post-match press conference as he admitted : ' i am here to win games and at the moment it is not possible and it takes a lot from the players to win one point			0
' if something does n't really change dramatically or individually as players in the next few weeks , it will be like that for the whole season and it is going to be different and not enjoyable			0
' i do n't think we can hide behind anything			0
i started talking about identity last year and i can not talk about it any more - this is not the way i want my teams to play			0
we have to play better and adapt to the game more than we are			0
