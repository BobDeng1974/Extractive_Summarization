when it comes to using your smartphone , @entity3 or laptop to access social media are you a hypersharer like @entity6 , a tinkerer like @entity8 or a make - doer like @entity10 ? a scientist has researched how we use technology and identified six distinct categories			1
his work also discovered that as well as @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity10 , @entity16 is a self - improver , @entity18 is a typical spectator and @entity19 fits into the content creator category			1
dr @entity21 , a lecturer at @entity22 , conducted the research in conjunction with @entity25 ' because technology is in every part of our lives '			1
' scientists tend to stray away from that sort of research , it ’s a difficult task , it 's like trying to dissect a human , ' e told @entity43			1
' i wanted to do this type of research because technology is in every part of our lifestyle , it 's connecting between our work and lifestyle			1
' i am interested in why people do that			0
we might be looking at @entity54 when we are at work or we might be at home responding to work emails			0
' the 38 - year - old , who is a self confessed lover of @entity60 , explained he wanted to know what technologies people are interested in , who the users are and to what capacity they used the technology			2
focus groups were set up and they interviewed two groups of 15 people - one group was aged between 22 - 25 who were full time students and the other set of 33 - 43 who were full time professionals			2
the groups were asked seven questions and they included one about if they use technology to create media			2
actress @entity16 is a ' self - improver ' using technology to make her life more productive dr @entity21 said that 73 per cent of the younger group used technology and 22 per cent of the older group used it			1
@entity84 scientist dr @entity21 , a lecturer at @entity22 , and set out six different types of technology users he went on to create six different ' technology types ' called the tinkerer , who is someone obsessed with technology like @entity29 ,			1
the music star : ' i 'm hands - on creative when it comes to technology collaboration			2
' a tinkerer is curious about technology and likes to take things apart to find out new solutions and shortcuts			0
the second type of person is a self improver , a person who uses technology to make life more productive			1
actress @entity16 said : ' i find all my looks for events on this app by browsing all the runway shows			0
it updates quickly during @entity113 , i truly could n't live without this app. ' these people are career - focussed and driven to deliver and they carry technology around , which helps them stay connected			0
the third is the hypersharer - aka @entity6 - who loves to share content			1
she said : ' i take in excess of 1200 selfies of myself everyday			0
it ended up turning out so cool that we came up with this idea ; a selfie book			0
' @entity6 loves to share content and takes more than 1200 selfies a day these people can usually be found pointing their devices at anything they find worth sharing			2
the fourth personality is the make - doer , someone like @entity10 who does n't care much about the newest trends			1
the friends star said : ' i 'm really computer illiterate			0
when i see people on their @entity138 , working them like some girls work a hair - dryer , i 'm just stunned			0
' @entity10 is a ' make - doer ' branding herself ' computer illiterate ' these people have a good personal style , they know what works for them and stick to it			2
the fifth type is the spectator who knows what is happening in the technology world but is n't fussed , like @entity18			2
she said : ' technology is like cotton candy : it looks appealing and you just ca n't resist getting in there			0
' these people are normally digital introverts and you might find them watching , reading , listening to talking about great stories			0
@entity18 is a technology ' spectator ' she is most likely to be found watching , reading or listening the sixth and final type dr @entity21 identified was the content creator , like @entity19			1
she said : ' i 'm about sharing my life ; it 's not always me saying ' buy my record , buy my record ! ' although i do say buy my record like once , and then i share a @entity173 video of a cat			0
' these people are usually dressed with flair and are working on their next big idea			0
@entity178 @entity19 is a ' content creator ' and loves sharing her life dr @entity21 said : ' this is the first time that this type of research has ever been done in @entity84			1
the quiz will be a nice way for people to see what technology type they are			1
' i would like to think that i am a will i am but i am a @entity19			0
' @entity189 from @entity25 told @entity43 that there 's no one size fits all approach when it comes to technology			0
' we want to help people find the tech that ’s right for them so they can make the most of every moment – as what we want , use and need is so personal to the individual ' to take the quiz log onto the @entity25 website			2
the tinkerer : technology obsessed , king of tech like @entity8 the self improver : uses technology to make life more productive like @entity16 the hypersharer : loves to post content aka @entity6 the make - doer : someone who does n't care so much about the newest and latest like @entity10 the spectator : someone who knows what 's happening in the technology world but is n't that fussed such as @entity18 the content creator : they love to create and share and are highly engaged in content discussion just like @entity19			1
