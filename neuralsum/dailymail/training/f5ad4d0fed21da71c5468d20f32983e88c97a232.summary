by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 09:46 est , 7 january 2013 travellers cleared from @entity2 after a lengthy legal battle have said they want to replace it with a new site more than twice the size			1
they want to build more than 100 new pitches on the green belt land in @entity9 , @entity10 , which they say is now contaminated anyway			1
news of the plans comes just 15 months after @entity14 and @entity15 spent £ 7.1m evicting around 80 families from the six - acre site			1
covered in rubbish : following the eviction , @entity2 became a target for fly - tippers and is now covered in old mattresses , washing machines and rubbish now the council , which had promised to restore it to greenbelt land , has been consulted by a campaigner for the travellers on what has been dubbed a ' supersite ' at @entity2			1
the new scheme would involve redeveloping all 51 demolished pitches and creating 20 temporary pitches along @entity35 where touring caravans are currently illegally parked			0
there would also be 40 upgraded neighbouring legal pitches			0
if approved , the site would be more than twice the size of the illegal development which stood in the town for more than a decade			2
today @entity14 confirmed that @entity43 , a campaigner for the travellers , had made extensive enquiries into submitting the radical plan			1
a council spokesman said : ' mr @entity43 has requested the council 's opinion as to whether an environmental impact assessment would need to be carried out prior to the possible submission of a planning application for the proposed development of a 111 - pitch gypsy and traveller site on land he refers to as being @entity2			2
battlefield in the green belt : this aerial photo shows what was @entity63 's biggest illegal traveller site shortly after it was cleared , with the legal site next door popular site : following the eviction , many travellers simply parked along the lane leading to @entity2 ' it should be stressed that no planning application has been submitted			1
' the council has three weeks from the submission date of the request to provide its opinion			0
' the consideration of this request does not affect the planning position or @entity80 status of the land			0
' mr @entity43 , who advises the travellers ' legal team , claims that concreting over the land and using it as traveller pitches is the only viable option for the potentially - contaminated site			1
he said : ' because the land is now contaminated with hazardous substances , the most sensible option will be to cap it with a concrete base and the only real potential use becomes another traveller site			2
' this will not only deal with the environmental problems caused by the clearance , but also meet the shortage of sites in the borough			0
' @entity102 , leader of @entity14 , described the possible application as ‘ ridiculous ’			2
he said : ' given the history of this site , and the number of legal challenges and decisions that have been made regarding @entity2 , i find it ridiculous that mr @entity43 could even consider submitting a planning application to redevelop the land			0
' i , along with many local people , find it an insult that after a decade of persistent law - breaking and significant cost to the taxpayer to uphold the law , that this is even being suggested			0
' he has learnt nothing from the @entity2 issue , and this is clearly a publicity stunt that will just waste valuable council officer time			1
' the site is within the green belt , and our green belt policy is clear , as is national planning policy			1
' however , there is nothing the council can do to stop an individual submitting a speculative application whether they have a chance of implementing their plans or not			0
' burning barricades : the eviction of @entity2 in october 2011 involved police and council workers and cost taxpayers £ 7.1m neighbour @entity144 , 54 , whose house backs on to the illegal site , said : ' this is another ludicrous plan			2
' there would be uproar if this got through and residents would make sure the whole council had to resign			0
' because of the amount of money spent on the eviction , to reinstate it would be madness			0
' the eviction , in october 2011 , involved more than 300 police officers , as well as bailiffs and council workers , and some of the residents had to be forcibly removed			0
many of the travellers who were evicted from the site in 2011 simply moved to a temporary camp 100 yards away			2
@entity14 promised to turn the site back into greenbelt land , but more than a year on it appears as if nothing has been done , and fly - tipped rubbish covers the site			1
the results of an @entity173 investigation into potentially dangerous pollutants - including asbestos and engine oil - allegedly dug up by council contractors during the eviction is expected within the coming weeks			0
last month @entity14 approved an application by the @entity180 in @entity181 ( @entity182 ) for a 15 - pitch site in @entity184 , just a mile away from the @entity2 site .			1

six - acre site in @entity10 's green belt cleared 15 months *ago* in *bitter* *scenes*
now same travellers plan to apply for new site twice the size of the old one
campaigner for travellers says *litter* - strewn site is contaminated now
leader of @entity14 describes new scheme as ' time - wasting publicity stunt '
