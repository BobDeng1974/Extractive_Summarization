a mother was hit with a staggering £ 1,200 in phone bills after texting hundreds of smiley face emoticon symbols that were n't included in her ' unlimited ' £ 31 - a - month contract			1
@entity5 , 48 , had no idea she was being charged 40p per emoticon by her contact provider @entity7 and said she was ' raging ' after the company only offered to cut her bill by £ 100			1
she is one thousands of people with certain @entity13 handsets who have been stung by the charges - which are a result of text messages being converted into pricier picture messages when the popular face symbols are included			1
not happy : @entity5 has been hit with a staggering £ 1,200 phone bill after texting hundreds of smiley face emoticon symbols that were n't included in her ' unlimited ' £ 31 - a - month contract speaking to the @entity23 , she said : ' i am raging			1
i have never heard of this before and i 've had a mobile phone for years			0
' even the staff at my local @entity7 shop were shocked when i told them			2
they knew nothing about it			0
do @entity7 really think i 'd run up these bills if i knew the cost ? it 's daylight robbery ' ' i feel violated that @entity7 have withdrawn more than £ 1,000 from my account for a £ 30.99 - a - month contract			2
' the hairdresser , of @entity41 , @entity42 , said that when her bill for november arrived and was more than £ 100 , she assumed she had used the phone for longer than the allocated minutes in her contract			1
huge charges : smiley dace icons are converting text messages into pricier picture messages costing many smartphone users a fortune as they are unaware of the charges she later called @entity7 to get to the bottom of the charge and was horrified to discover that her combined bills for december and january were almost £ 900 - and her pending charge for february has already exceeded £ 150			1
she was told by an adviser that the @entity60 smiley face symbols were being sent as picture messages			1
an @entity7 spokesman told @entity63 : ' there are a number of factors which can affect whether customers are charged for sending an emoji usually by the settings on the handset and so is a manufacturer – rather than a network issue			1
‘ @entity7 has a help section on the website which details instances where an sms may convert into @entity77			2
' if you are using a pre- 2014 @entity13 handset , including the @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , as well as the @entity84 1 , 2 , 3 and @entity85 , you could be hit with huge charges for sending emoticons in messages , no matter what network you are using			1
this is because a number of their older handsets convert texts into picture messages when you include the smiley face icons			1
picture messages , or @entity77 ( multi-media service ) messages cost far more than standard texts - meaning users can be hit by huge bills if they send dozens of the symbols every day			1
@entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 have all said that including an emoji or emoticon symbol in a text with their models will not convert it into an mms			1
if you own one of the @entity13 handsets affected , you can stop this from happening by taking the following steps ( instructions may vary depending on what handset you use ) : 1			2
scroll to @entity121 mode 4			0
@entity122 instead of automatic @entity124 alphabet ( depending on handset ) you could also use an app rather than your network to send messages			0
if you 're out and about you 'll be using your data but if you 're using @entity132 , there 's nothing extra to pay			0
step 1 and 2 : enter your message setting on your @entity13 phone			2
depending on what handset you have , the presentation of these options may vary step 1 : enter your message icon step 2 : select message settings step 3 : scroll to @entity121 mode step 4 : select gsm alphabet they added : ' mrs @entity5 did not query her bills with us until the end of january			2
’ ms @entity5 had used smiley faces that were on her phone 's toolbar and not from a downloaded app. she is not alone - as consumer website @entity157 has received a huge number of complaints about the issue			1
in some cases , especially on older handsets , the emoticons are converted into @entity77 ( multi-media service ) messages , which can cost up to 40p each depending on what network you 're on			2
and other smartphone users who create their own icons from full - stops , colons and brackets have found they are being converted into emoticons - running up the same charges			0
older handsets known to be affected include the @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , as well as the @entity84 1 , 2 , 3 and @entity85			0
a @entity13 spokesman told @entity63 : ' we can confirm that as of april 2014 , every @entity13 mobile device has a default setting that classifies emoticon images as an sms and not an @entity77			2
popular craze : emoticons , also known as emojis , are used to portray a texter 's mood of feelings and are commonly used by people with smartphones ' for older devices , if a message is going to be converted from an sms into an @entity77 , a warning message is displayed to inform the user of this			0
' we advise our customers to check their mobile phone tariffs if they are unsure of any charges related to @entity180 and @entity77 as well as the advisory notices displayed on their handset			0
' @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 have all said that including an emoji in a text will not convert it into an mms			1
the word emoticon comes from emotion and icon also known as emojis , they are used to portray a texter 's mood of feelings - and in the earliest form were produced by sending combinations of colons and brackets to create facial expressions			0
many smartphones now come with a vast collection of emoticon symbols , while apps containing thousands more can also be downloaded			0
the current form of emoticons first rose to popularity in @entity60			0
in the autumn , @entity220 conducted a survey looking at all the reasons why people received higher - than - expected bills			0
emoticons being billed as picture messages had affected four per cent of those who responded to the survey			1
one woman , who was hit with a £ 209 charge , told @entity231 : ' i phoned up @entity7 to be informed that as my son has been including emojis in his messages , they are charged as picture messages , and not included in his contract			1
one @entity239 customer said she had also been hit with a large bill and was told emoticons were classed as picture messages on @entity13 phones			1
she said : ' @entity7 has now agreed to halve the bill , which i suppose i will have to accept , but i would just like to warn any other computer / smartphone illiterate parents of the pitfalls ! ' speaking on the issue an @entity220 spokesperson told the @entity250 : ' we are aware that in some circumstances sms may be transferred into @entity77 ( for example , where one text is sent to multiple recipients or where an emoticon or emoji is used )			2
affected : people have reported the problem while using a number of @entity13 's handsets ' based on our previous engagement with mobile providers about long texts / texts sent to multiple recipients and the subsequent conversion to @entity77 , our understanding is that the conversion is a handset issue			1
how that message is subsequently charged would be a mobile provider issue			0
' however there are rules on transparency – we would expect mobile providers to make clear to consumers how much @entity77 cost and when such charges would apply			0
' if you are on a monthly contract , the amount you pay for @entity77 messages will vary depending on what network you use			0
here 's what each major company charges : @entity7 : @entity288 @entity239 : @entity288 @entity289 : 40p three : 19.8p @entity290 : @entity291 @entity292 : 40p @entity293 : 40p an @entity239 spokesman said : ' if a customer is using a smartphone to send text messages to more than one person at the same time , they could be charged the cost of sending an mms			1
' it can also happen when the message contains icons , emoticons and symbols or an email address			0
and some apps ( such as @entity308 ) that integrate with a customer ’s contact list in their smartphone may result in an @entity77 charge too			0
' to stop this happening , customers should make sure they do n’t include symbols , icons or emoticons and also disable the integration between their contact list and apps like @entity308			0
' it ’s worth noting that many of these smartphones / devices will alert customers when a sms message is converting to an @entity77 message before it is sent			0

@entity5 , 48 , had no idea she was being charged 40p per emoticon
hairdresser , from @entity42 , was ' raging ' after finding out from @entity7
@entity333 faces converting texts to picture messages on @entity13 phones
this means many users are racking up huge bills without even realising
other major phone manufacturers including @entity104 and @entity107 say the problem does not affect their handsets
