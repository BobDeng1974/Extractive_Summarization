with her creamy skin , toned legs and impressive embonpoint , it is no wonder @entity6 drew admiring glances when she stepped out in a bright red swimsuit on a @entity10 beach this week			2
as she approaches her 50th birthday next january , the @entity13 frump who married a @entity15 has disappeared and , in her place , is a svelte and confident mother of two who has lost weight and is n’t afraid to try daring new styles			1
@entity21 reveals how the ‘ @entity24 ’ got ready for the beach — and what prompted her amazing make - over			1
the @entity6 joins some of the other mums at the private prep school attended by her children at a local @entity33 class in @entity39 once a week			2
a trainer comes every week to her home , @entity42 in @entity43			2
working out on a cross-trainer and swimming have banished any bingo wings			2
‘ @entity6 ’s exercises are geared towards her shape and working with what she has , ’ says a source			2
‘ now she is toned , she looks much better in fitted dresses and suits			2
she does n’t do much weightlifting because she does n’t want veins like @entity55			2
’ when @entity57 saw how well she was doing , he signed up with her personal trainer			2
his workout is based on @entity61 exercises — though he dropped out of the famously tough unit after just a few months			2
she 's lost a stone , dropping from a size 14 to a 12 through good old - fashioned cardiovascular exercise			1
@entity6 goes for five - mile runs with @entity57 twice a week and runs on her own most days			1
the result is she can wear nipped in waistlines			1
gone are the boxy jackets and sensible skirts			2
in their place are dresses by @entity74 — a favourite of the @entity76 — and a sensational £ 1,500 electric blue @entity78 bodycon dress with a sexy back zipper she wore at the @entity82 service at @entity83			1
blessed with a peaches and cream complexion , much like her late mother @entity86 , @entity6 is beautifully translucent close - up			1
she wears very little make - up and uses a light spray tan when she wears a backless dress or before a holiday , such as her @entity10 break			1
however , unlike the @entity76 , she ’s not afraid of tanning naturally			2
it ’s something she can hardly avoid , given her outdoorsy lifestyle of running and riding			0
indeed , she sports a tan line around her freckled neck , attesting to her love of the sun. but despite her new streamlined body , she ’s eschewed botox , accepting the fine lines around her eyes and across her forehead			0
dropped a stone : @entity6 's waist is looking svelte thanks to five - mile runs with @entity57 twice a week they 've always been sturdy , but @entity6 ’s legs are now much more toned and muscular , thanks to running and riding horses			1
most saturday mornings , @entity6 rides with the family — @entity57 , ten - year - old @entity114 and @entity115 , @entity113 , six , who have their own ponies — at @entity83 , 11 miles from their home			1
she is regularly seen on horseback alongside the @entity120 , to whom she is close			0
her majesty always chooses @entity6 to sit next to her on the way to church at @entity124 and @entity82			0
they share a great knowledge of and interest in military history			0
sources say the @entity76 has done a lot of work on her thighs and they ’ve been further toned by her love of skiing — the family took their regular winter holiday in @entity137 this year			0
however , despite meeting @entity57 at a @entity139 event in 1993 , she ’s not an enthusiastic player any more			0
nor does she still play the golf she once loved			0
‘ she wo n’t acknowledge she is n’t any good , ’ says a source			0
‘ certainly not as good as @entity76 or @entity144 in this respect			0
’ after being plagued by health problems — she had an ectopic pregnancy in 2001 and nearly died from a placental abruption in 2003 - @entity6 is keen to safeguard her future health			1
a key part of this is following a nutrient - packed diet			1
a royal source said : ‘ she ’s forward - looking and grateful for what she has			1
‘ @entity6 is focused and has very much put all her troubles behind her			0
she certainly takes her fitness , diet and health seriously			0
’ while the countess is not on a diet , she ’s health conscious about what she eats , favouring smoothies or sometimes porridge for breakfast			0
otherwise , she likes chicken and fish , plus lots of fresh fruit — she loves watermelon and grapes			0
however , she does not eat bread , pastries , fry - ups or snacks			1
desserts are sorbets and fruit rather than sugary puddings			0
@entity6 enjoys entertaining , but a @entity179 supper party is simple : fish pie and salad or the occasional risotto			1
even the handmade sausages she indulges in at prince @entity185 ’s barbecues in @entity186 are served with a healthy avocado salad			1
and , like @entity57 , she barely touches alcohol , even at official events			0
the children have a similarly healthy diet and are not allowed snacks , biscuits or chips			0
at tea parties they are allowed a slice of carrot or beetroot cake			0
@entity6 is sporting £ 245 @entity200 sunglasses — the designer brand favoured by the flashy and well - heeled , such as @entity203 @entity202 and @entity204 , @entity205 ’s girlfriend			1
however , on the beach @entity6 wrapped herself up in a @entity208 - branded white towelling cover - up costing around £ 30 — something the likes of @entity202 and @entity204 would never be seen in			1
designer : like the @entity203 , @entity6 has a penchant for @entity200 , which she showcased with these sunglasses like every woman approaching middle age , @entity6 appreciates the importance of good support , be it in a swimsuit or a gala dress			1
this red swimsuit by celebrity designer @entity222 has ruching and padded cups ( ‘ for an effortless holiday cover - up , ’ claims the @entity226 website ) to make the cleavage look as good as possible			1
while many women avoid red for fear of looking predatory , @entity6 has actually picked the most flattering choice			0
as lips and cheeks naturally lose their pink tint as we age , due to a drop in oestrogen levels , a bright swimming costume provides a flattering injection of colour , warming up the skin			0
long before @entity76 started going to @entity244 ’s salon in @entity245 , @entity6 was a customer			0
but the @entity76 apparently kick - started her make - over			1
‘ @entity6 did n’t want to be upstaged , ’ says one well - placed royal source			1
she is blonder than she ’s ever been , having creamy highlights every six weeks			0
and at an age when many women opt to cut their hair short , she ’s grown hers to below her shoulders , though she wears it in a ponytail or chignon for formal engagements .			0

' @entity24 ' has lost a stone doing two weekly five - mile runs
bread is off the menu and salad is in to keep her waist nipped
she showcased her designer taste in £ 245 @entity200 sunglasses
