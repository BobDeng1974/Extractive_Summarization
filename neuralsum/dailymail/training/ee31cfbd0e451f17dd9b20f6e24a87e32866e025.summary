by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:43 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 03:52 est , 20 december 2012 @entity4 chiefs were alerted to @entity5 ’s ‘ dark side ’ months before it became public , it emerged yesterday			1
they learned ‘ the real truth ’ about the twisted entertainer more than two years ago – while he was still alive			2
yet nothing was done , and shortly after his death , fulsome tribute programmes were aired and a @entity16 expose of his paedophile past was scrapped			0
a damning report yesterday revealed ‘ chaos ’ and a ‘ critical lack of leadership ’ at the heart of the @entity4			1
but in spite of the scathing conclusions , no one will be sacked			0
pass the buck : @entity28 made an ' ethically dubious ' attempt to shift the blame over the @entity32 crisis the report by former @entity35 head @entity34 brands the corporation ‘ incapable ’ of getting to grips with the @entity32 crisis and said it was mired in ‘ chaos and confusion ’			1
it also revealed : as the excoriating report was published , @entity4 deputy director of news @entity42 retired and @entity16 ’s editor @entity45 and his deputy @entity46 lost their posts			1
but incredibly , none of the bosses moved from their posts will be sacked			0
and director of news @entity50 – censured for failing to tackle the ‘ meltdown ’ in her department – returns to her desk today after a period of gardening leave			1
@entity59 mp @entity58 said the report suggested ‘ the @entity4 lives in a separate moral universe from the rest of the country ’ , adding : ‘ the public will be questioning why no one has been sacked as a result of these serious failings			2
’ the @entity5 case has become one of the biggest sex abuse scandals in @entity73 history , with 450 victims now saying they were abused by the @entity75 yet the @entity4 failed to unmask him as a predatory paedophile after scrapping its @entity16 investigation and failing to even pass on crucial evidence to the police			1
were it not for an @entity85 documentary shown in october , his four - decade rampage of abuse may never have come to light			0
culpability : @entity28 resigned less than a month after he took the director general role , but no one involved in the @entity32 debacle will lose their jobs @entity4 executives and celebrities accused of turning a blind eye to @entity5 ’s offending have repeatedly insisted they were powerless to act on mere ‘ rumours ’			1
but mr @entity34 said there was ‘ real knowledge , not just rumour ’ within @entity4 television ‘ about the unsavoury side of @entity5 ’s character ’			1
mr @entity28 was sent explosive emails warning of @entity5 ’s ‘ dark side ’ as he prepared to order tribute programmes after the @entity75 died in october 2011			1
but mr @entity28 – handed £ 450,000 of licence - payers ’ money when he quit the @entity4 after the @entity109 disaster – claims he never read the email warnings and did not ask any questions			1
his claims were undermined by forensic examination of mr @entity28 ’s two email accounts , which showed the emails had been opened			2
withheld : the report also found that @entity16 may have sat on evidence about @entity5 's crimes for months the first were sent to him on may 29 , 2010 – a full 17 months before @entity5 died – by @entity119 , former @entity4 head of events , who warned he would feel ‘ very queasy ’ if the @entity4 produced an obituary for @entity5 when he died as he knew ‘ the real truth ’			1
but instead of finding out what was meant by this , mr @entity28 says he does not recall the email			2
then after @entity5 died , on october 29 , 2011 , @entity4 commissioning editor @entity127 emailed mr @entity28 about ‘ the darker side ’ of @entity32			1
mr @entity28 , then the @entity4 ’s head of television , told the @entity130 he ‘ could not remember ’ reading that email , and did not reply to it			1
yet on the same day , mr @entity28 did reply to a separate email suggesting the @entity4 produce a ‘ homage ’ to @entity32 , saying it was ‘ a great idea ’			1
mr @entity34 found that , as the @entity32 crisis threatened mr @entity28 , the director general devised a strategy to save himself by heaping all the blame on his @entity16 editor			1
he told @entity140 and two other senior executives : ‘ i have decided that i need to protect the @entity4 and @entity142 within it , and i ’m going to do a statement that makes it impossible for @entity45 not to resign			0
’ he backed down when ‘ it was pointed out that this was an ethically dubious thing to do ’ , mr @entity34 was told			1
miss @entity50 has survived in her £ 340,000 - a - year job while her 63 - year - old second - in - command mr @entity42 has resigned – leading to an old joke recirculating around the @entity4 that in times of crisis at the corporation , ‘ deputy heads will roll ’			1
miss @entity50 ’s lawyers had suggested to mr @entity34 it would be wrong to criticise her and attribute failings to her during this period			0
but he said she ‘ should have taken greater responsibility ’			0
he said he was ‘ surprised ’ she did not take ‘ a more proactive role ’ particularly given that a ‘ significant part of her division ’ was in ‘ virtual meltdown ’			0
the @entity4 spent £ 2million on the @entity130 to find out if corporation chiefs scrapped the @entity16 investigation to preserve their @entity168 schedule , which was to include the @entity32 tribute shows			2
mr @entity34 concluded that although the @entity4 ’s decision was ‘ seriously flawed ’ it had not been taken for this reason			1
mr @entity28 said the report made clear that ‘ i played no part in determining the fate of the @entity16 expose on @entity5 ’			1
he added : ‘ as director general , in october 2012 , as soon as i became aware of allegations of sexual abuse against @entity178 , i took the matter straight to the police and offered the @entity4 ’s full co-operation with their investigations			1
’ no one is to be sacked over the second @entity4 scandal , in which @entity109 was wrongly branded a paedophile after a disastrous @entity16 report			2
a separate probe published yesterday found bungling news executives failed to conduct ‘ basic checks ’ and ignored their own editorial guidelines			2
the fiasco , which prompted @entity28 ’s resignation as @entity4 director general , was a ‘ grave breach which had been costly to all concerned ’ , said the report by the @entity198			1
but the report – based on an internal investigation by @entity201 , director of @entity202 – did not recommend any sackings			0
a second report into the botched @entity16 investigation did n't recommend any sackings , despite ' basic checks ' being ignored it also failed to identify all those who ‘ signed off ’ the report for broadcast , causing one of the worst mistakes in modern journalism			0
there is no attempt to explain , for example , why the @entity4 ’s highly paid army of lawyers failed to stop the damaging report being aired			2
however the @entity198 said three @entity4 employees had been ‘ subject to disciplinary action ’			0
one is @entity46 , who was editing @entity16 on november 2 when the report was broadcast , who has been moved to another job at the @entity4			0
@entity109 was wrongly linked to a child sex abuse scandal as a result of the @entity16 investigation			0
the @entity4 was forces to pay £ 185,000 in damages another is @entity231 5 live controller @entity232 , who was overseeing @entity16 in the wake of @entity32 , and is to step down from his role			2
the programme , which featured an interview with @entity239 who said a senior political figure of the time abused him , led to the widespread naming of @entity109			0
the @entity59 peer , who had not been contacted by the programme , strenuously denied the allegations , and is now suing all those who wrongly named him			0
it later emerged that mr @entity250 had not even been shown a photo of the politician – and when he eventually saw one , he realised he had made a mistake			0
the following week , @entity16 broadcast an apology , as well as apologies from mr @entity250			0
@entity109 later received £ 185,000 damages from the corporation			0
the probe said matters were made worse by the fact that , in the hours prior to broadcast , @entity261 , managing editor of the @entity262 of investigative journalism which worked on the report , tweeted : ‘ if all goes well we ’ve got a @entity16 out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile ’			2
the @entity268 said this caused ‘ alarm and consternation ’ among the @entity16 editorial team , and acting editor @entity273 asked @entity274 , the @entity275 reporter working on the @entity277 programme , to call @entity278 ‘ immediately and tell him to stop tweeting ’			0
the @entity198 ’s editorial standards committee said : ‘ this was a high - risk report which required rigorous supervision and did not receive it			0
‘ the allegations were not based on sound evidence			0
they were not thoroughly tested and , whilst there was no suggestion that the programme - makers had sought to mislead the public , this had been the effect			0

bosses ignored warnings about @entity75 's ' dark side '
@entity16 editor forced to take blame to protect the director general
head of news censured - but she will be back at her desk today
a *culture* of *distrust* and a ‘ critical lack of leadership ’ crippled the @entity4 ’s response to the crisis .
former director general @entity28 was incapable of getting a grip and made an ‘ ethically dubious ’ bid to shift the blame elsewhere .
@entity16 failed to provide police with the evidence of @entity5 ’s crimes – leading to accusations that it had ‘ been sitting on evidence for several months ’ .
the public were repeatedly misled as bosses failed to ‘ get the truth ’ about what happened .
the @entity327 yesterday attacked the @entity4 for a ‘ *cavalier* ’ use of public money over the £ 450,000 ‘ *golden* *handshake* ’ it gave to mr @entity28 , and other executive pay - outs .
