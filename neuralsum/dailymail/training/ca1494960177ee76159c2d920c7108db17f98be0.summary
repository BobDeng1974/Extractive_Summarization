by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 01:56 est , 13 october 2012 the planned sale of 316 @entity3 branches to rival @entity4 collapsed last night in a ‘ major blow ’ to the state - backed lender			1
troubled @entity3 – 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer after a £ 45billion bailout – has been working on the deal for two years as it battles to recover from the banking crisis			1
but @entity12 buyer @entity4 has pulled the plug , blaming the poor quality of @entity3 ’s it systems , which crashed over the summer			1
setback : @entity17 hailed the deal to sell branches ' an important milestone ' the collapse of the £ 1.65billion deal is another setback for @entity3 chief executive @entity17 , who has been forced to sacrifice his bonus for the past two years			1
the bank is also braced for a large penalty for its involvement in the libor rate - rigging scandal that saw rival @entity29 fined £ 290million			0
when the deal to sell the 316 branches was agreed in 2010 , mr @entity17 hailed it as ‘ an important milestone in our restructuring ’			2
the disposals were ordered by the @entity36 in return for the @entity40 government ’s rescue of @entity3 in 2008			1
sources said the bank is confident a new deal can be reached before the @entity45 deadline at the end of next year			0
other potential buyers include sir @entity49 ’s @entity48 – which took over @entity50 – @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , which recently bought more than 600 branches from @entity55			0
it is thought @entity3 may even spin the branches off as a separate company and list them on the @entity59			1
' major blow ' : @entity12 bank @entity4 pulled out on the deal to buy the branches , blaming @entity3 ' poor quality it systems the collapse will throw into confusion the bank transfers of some 1.8million @entity3 customers			1
however a source insisted it was ‘ business as usual ’			0
any customer already issued with a credit or debit card or account number under the @entity4 brand will be able to carry on using them as an existing customer of @entity3 , the bank promised last night			1
it said it is ‘ determined that the decision will have no impact on the service available to customers ’			0
mr @entity17 said : ‘ i can assure all affected customers that there will be no disruption to the service they receive			0
it is business as usual in all of these branches , and customers do n’t need to take any action			0
’ he went on : ‘ while this is a profitable part of our business that we would rather not part with , @entity3 has worked hard to ensure it is substantially separate from our @entity40 branch network and corporate business and largely ready to be taken on by a new owner			1
much of the heavy lifting associated with a transfer has already been completed , including separating data for customers and putting in place a standalone management team			0
‘ it is of course disappointing that @entity4 decided to pull out of this transaction , especially for the customers and staff involved			0
‘ however , @entity3 ’s strong progress in our restructuring plans means we can continue to provide a stable home for this business and its customers pending a further resolution			2
@entity3 will commence a new process of disposal and will provide a further update in due course			2
’ the proposed deal , which involved the sale of 310 @entity3 branches in @entity125 and @entity126 and six @entity128 branches in @entity129 , has been fraught with problems and delays			1
the major sticking point has been the compatibility of the @entity3 accounts with @entity4 ’s computer systems			2
the bank has a poor record in moving other banks ’ customer to its own it system			2
two years ago it bodged the transfer of five million @entity144 customers acquired in a takeover in 2008 , and some customers were locked out of their accounts for weeks .			0
