an insecure boy has transformed his figure , his confidence and his love life after taking up weightlifting as a young teenager			1
after a tough breakup @entity6 , 21 , from @entity7 , put all his focus into training and before he knew it he was competing at a national level - and turning heads			1
' i started working out when i was 16 due to a recent end in a relationship ; i needed something to keep me busy and occupied ... the gym seemed like a good idea , ' he says			1
after a tough break up in 2010 a 16 - yr - old @entity6 , 21 , from @entity7 put his focus into training and before he knew it was competing at a national level - and turning heads			1
pictured here aged 16 in 2010 before training started ( l ) and recently , four stone heavier , aged 21 ( r ) ' before i started training i thought i was skinny and did n't really like the appearance that looked back at me in the mirror			1
' i was a typical gaming geek			2
i used to eat microwave meals and drink tonnes of @entity34 with no real feeding pattern - more than likely between a game on the @entity37			2
' i was tall , thin and that was about it			2
i only weighed about 10 stone , so it was time things changed			1
' i quickly got the bug and enjoyed working out more than i thought			1
i saw progress in my body and this spurred me on even more , wanting to be bigger , leaner and stronger			1
' my first bodybuilding competition was 2011 , when i had just turned 18			2
i then competed at a higher level in 2012 and qualified for the @entity51 @entity50 finals			2
' after bodybuilding my focus changed from wanting to be the most aesthetically pleasing to being the strongest i could possibly be			2
' i hung up my trunks and pursued powerlifting , in which i again qualified to a national level achieving a 210kg squat and a 240kg deadlift			2
@entity6 says being in ' competition condition ' became good for catching people 's attention @entity6 is pictured here in @entity63 2013 , one year after he began bodybuilding competitions , aged 19 ' my biggest focus at the moment is developing my career and my personal training business , however i hope to make a return to both bodybuilding and powerlifting in the next few years			1
' and it seems his path to fitness has helped his love life , as he 's since bagged a girlfriend			1
' dating wise , being in competition condition was always good for attraction and catching peoples attention - but nothing more			1
my girlfriend of 16 months , @entity82 , was actually first attracted to me because i was " ripped " , so i guess you could say it helped ! ' @entity82 is actually training to be a fitness instructor			1
she is in college and currently trains with me during the week			2
we met through friends , then we started training together and then our relationship developed further			1
' @entity82 says : ' i remember seeing @entity6 and i was instantly attracted to him			1
he was tall , dark , handsome and i loved his six pack ! ' there are quite a few positives about working out together			1
we motivate and support each other to reach our goals			2
@entity6 is honest with me about what areas i need to work on			1
i love training with @entity6 as each session is enjoyable and he fully supports me in everything i want to achieve			1
' i am extremely proud of what @entity6 has achieved , the biggest thing for me is seeing how much he has grown as a person			1
his maturity and attitude has changed so much and seeing his transformation is amazing for such a young man too			2
i know there is a lot more to come out of him and i am with him every step of the way			2
' but @entity6 says his biggest support when it comes to competitions is his mother			1
' throughout competition prep she was amazing , she helped prep meals , helped me pull through tough times and even tanned / shaved me the night before the competition			2
i could n't have done it without her			2
@entity6 's girlfriend of 16 months , @entity82 , was first attracted to him because he was " ripped " ' my health has improved massively and so has my quality of life			1
' my outlook on nutrition is completely different - i eat to feel and look good so i do n't mind taking longer to plan and prepare meals			0
' i truly believe the struggles and dark times i faced during competition prep has shaped who i am today			0
my mentality and my focus have improved dramatically and i am now a very driven goal - orientated person , before which i was lacking focus , clarity and self - belief			0
' ' in regards to image i have gone from a small 10 stone , up to 15 stone at my biggest but i tend to carry a weight of around 14 stone year round			1
' my whole shape has dramatically changed , as well as the way i view myself			0
i never believed image was important , but in the job i now lead i feel it is a massive part of building the respect of clients			0
' i became a brand ambassador for @entity153 after entering a social media competition and i 'm so grateful to my sponsors for their support , encouragement and inspiration			0
' with my shift in mind set and focus i am now set on helping other people transform their lifestyles like i did mine			0
i would like to compete again as both a powerlifter and a bodybuilder , but for now i am primarily focused on growing my business , @entity166 , and helping others			0
' my advice for youngsters wanting to follow in my footsteps would be to learn the basics			0
' get good at the basic movements and ensure you are doing them correctly			0
research and ask people who have been there and done what you 're trying to achieve and then make your own judgement on what you believe			0
nutrition wise , keep things simple , do n't over complicate things			0
for training , exactly the same , do n't get caught up in these advanced routines for advanced trainees , just keep it simple , and stick to the basics			0
' @entity191 a personal trainer and expert in teen fitness from @entity195 says starting a structured resistance training programme at 16 is perfectly safe ' provided it is done so under qualified guidance '			1
the fitness expert , who has trained @entity201 star @entity200 , fighter @entity202 and @entity204 's @entity203 since he was 14 years old , says : ' i certainly concur that the confidence - boosting qualities experienced by @entity6 's are not exclusive to him , ' ' every single youth we have trained at @entity195 has benefited both in the gym and out of it			1
i find training to be incredibly empowering			0
hard work and dedication is rewarded accordingly			0
' when prepping for a competition @entity6 trains four times a week split across the muscle groups the heaviest i 've been is 96kg and my last stage weight was 75kg with a body fat of around 7 or 8 per cent			1
competition mode when i 'm in prep i train four times a week split across the muscle groups			1
it would be chest and shoulders , back and traps , arms , and legs , across a four day time period			0
a typical training split i use when training for competitions include weight and cardio sessions , training two on , one off and cardio every other day for 20 minutes each session			0
off season now when in ' off season ' mode i train three times a week on a push - pull , legs basis with more of an emphasis on recovery between workouts			0
it is very much based around compound exercises trying to add as much stress to the body as possible			0
rep ranges are often kept between five and eight but sometimes i go as high as 12 , depending on exercise and body part			0
stretching and foam rollering is very important for me as my hips have taken a beating through powerlifting , so i follow an 11 set routine before i train to make sure my hips are fully ready for training			0
supplements my supplement regime is very consistent , on waking i have a multi vitamin , vitamin @entity264 , omega 3 fish oils , 1 scoop of @entity268 superfood blend and one scoop of warrior @entity271 superfood blend , this covers all health bases and gives my body a prime platform for growing			1
during training i used @entity277 which is a fast digesting protein , alongside cyclic dextrin which is a fast digesting carbohydrate and kick starts my recovery before i 've even finished my workout			0
diet i eat plenty of chicken cooked in extra virgin olive oil , steak , spinach , kale , sweet potato , peanut butter , porridge , whey and some white rice			0
@entity296 snack on protein bars and popcorn and drink plenty of coffee ( perhaps too much )			0
those are most of my food choices , and i just vary the quantities			0
my competition diet consists of higher protein , moderate carbs and low fats			0

@entity6 , 21 , from @entity7 , added four stone of muscle over 3 years
started working out in the gym at 16 due to a *painful* breakup
quickly saw changes and it spurred him on to get stronger
