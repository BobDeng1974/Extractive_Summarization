’ free like a bird : this nest - inspired living space allows you to sleep in pods within the trees using bamboo connected together with ropes , a structural grid allows ‘ triangulated pots ’ to be created , with size depending on intended usage			2
sleeping areas can be different sizes , with larger pods for families , while there is scope for connected pots for larger functions such as a hotel lobby or restaurant and pods for a bathroom or toilet			2

calming : get close to nature by living among the trees in tipis made out of bamboo complete with their own spacious balconies ccologically sensitive concept : the triangular pods are inspired by nests and the tipis of @entity9 @entity12 , who created the concept for the @entity58 ' legend of tent ' competition say : ‘ the structure is inspired by the tipis of native americans , which did n’t leave any harm on the site , nor on the material itself , because the joints were connected with ropes , so the tents were easy to construct , deconstruct and carried			1
‘ we see the structure not just as an element which inhabits typical functions of a hotel and is connected to nature , we also see it as an element , where nature can be implemented and after a certain time , those plants can grow take over the whole structure			0
