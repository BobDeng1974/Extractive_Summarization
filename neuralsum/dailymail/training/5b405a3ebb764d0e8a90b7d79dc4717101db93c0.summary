by @entity0 last updated at 4:23 pm on 3rd january 2012 he was the last member of the @entity2 to hold office in the @entity4 - but it seems none of the new candidates want to talk about him			1
@entity8 , the two - term @entity9 president who finished just three years ago , has hardly been mentioned on the @entity2 campaign trail so far			1
no contenders have embraced a legacy of huge budget deficits , two wars and record low approval ratings - or blame him for @entity9 ’s troubles			2
not remembered : @entity8 , a two - term president who finished just three years ago , has hardly been mentioned on the @entity2 campaign trail so far the seven contenders often criticise @entity18 and @entity19 - but only fleeting references have been made to president @entity8			1
however his name was brought up by a voter in a question to @entity25 rep. @entity24 , who is often critical of @entity9 military engagements abroad			0
‘ we 've had , in the past , a couple of presidents from @entity25 that said they were n't interested in wars - like @entity8 , ’ the voter said			2
‘ my question is - how can we trust another @entity25 ? ’ analyst @entity34 said @entity2 ' talk a lot about losing their way during the last decade ' and are ' talking about the @entity8 years '			1
‘ for republicans , the @entity8 administration has become the " yadda yadda yadda " period of @entity9 history , ’ the political science professor added			2
targets : the seven contenders often criticise @entity18 , right , and @entity19 , left - but only fleeting references have been made to president @entity8 when the eight - year @entity8 presidency does surface it 's often a point of criticism , with a former @entity47 senator coming in with an attack			1
' for republicans , the @entity8 administration has become the " yadda yadda yadda " period of @entity9 history ' @entity34 candidate @entity50 told @entity51 on sunday that he regretted voting for the @entity52 education law @entity8 championed			2
the former president himself has been all but invisible since leaving office in 2009 with a @entity58 approval rating of just 34 per cent			1
@entity59 had a 66 per cent approval rating in 2001 when he stepped down after two terms marred by a sex scandal and impeachment			1
the presidential contest has been dominated by concerns over the weak economy , government spending and the $ 15trillion federal debt			0
but @entity2 controlled @entity69 for six of the eight years president @entity8 was in power , clearing the way for many of his policies to be enacted			1
contender : @entity50 told @entity51 on sunday that he regretted voting for the @entity52 education law @entity8 championed president @entity19 's policies , including the federal stimulus programme and car industry bailout , have swollen the deficit and deepened the debt			2
' i think @entity8 has made @entity9 a safer nation and better nation and i 'm proud of it			0
but politics is n't about what 's fair , it 's about winning ' @entity87 he often falls back on complaints about the bad situation he inherited when seeking to defend his own economic performance			0
but while he may often like to blame the @entity8 years , @entity2 presidential contenders seem just as eager to pretend those years never happened			1
‘ sad to say , they 're looking at polling data that indicates they 're better off not bringing him into the campaign , ’ ex-bush spin doctor @entity87 said			0
‘ i think president @entity8 has made @entity9 a safer nation and better nation and i 'm proud of it			0
but politics is n't about what 's fair - it 's about winning			0
’ taking office in 2001 with a balanced federal budget and a surplus , he pushed through sweeping tax cuts that were not offset by spending cuts			0
unpopular : @entity8 left office with an approval rating of 34 per cent the tax cuts have cost about $ 1.8trillion and were set to expire after 10 years , but president @entity19 allowed them to remain in place temporarily			1
that was in exchange for a jobless benefits extension and a payroll tax cut			0
the wars in @entity117 and @entity118 after the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 were never budgeted and have cost taxpayers $ 1.4trillion so far			0
@entity8 signed legislation in 2003 enacting a prescription drug benefit as part of @entity124 , projected to cost as much as $ 1.2trillion over 10 years			1
the @entity125 , the bank bailout programme widely loathed by many conservatives , was another @entity8 - era program			0
@entity69 authorised nearly $ 700billion in response to the collapse of investment bank @entity131 and the subsequent financial crisis in autumn 2008 .			0

@entity8 only left @entity4 three years ago
but no @entity2 candidates have blamed him for troubles
