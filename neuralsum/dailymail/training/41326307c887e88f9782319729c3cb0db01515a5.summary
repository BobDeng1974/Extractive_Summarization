they are among the division 's quickest , but can not quite keep up with one man - @entity18 's @entity17			1

@entity70 's top speed was matched by @entity73 forward @entity74 when he faced @entity61 in mid-october and scored all of his side 's goals in a 4 - 1 victory			1
summer signing @entity70 ( right ) has added some spark to @entity71 's attack since arriving from @entity82 @entity74 , pictured completing his hat - trick against @entity61 , ran at a top speed of 34.7kph but it 's not just speed that matters out on the pitch , it 's also how much of it you 're able to cover			2
@entity90 has turned @entity56 into a more stylish side since taking over from @entity92 in the summer of 2013 , but the @entity93 remain one of the hardest - working teams in the @entity2			2
that is perfectly illustrated by @entity97 , who has covered 227 kilometres in his 20 appearances - the most by any player this season			2

another of the league 's most creative players , @entity61 ' @entity120 , has also shown he 's not afraid to work hard for his manager , having run 222km - the equivalent of over five marathons			0

the @entity131 has managed 187.1km so far , although that is only enough to beat @entity73 's @entity133 ( 179.7km ) and @entity28 defender @entity134 ( 173.1km )			0

@entity69 's @entity155 ( right ) tussles with @entity163 striker @entity162 on @entity164 @entity143 ( right ) has been arguably @entity144 's hardest working player since joining the club from @entity163 all running data compiled courtesy of @entity169 .			0
