@entity1 vice-captain @entity0 has hit back at @entity2 for the ‘ specialist in failure ’ jibe he aimed at @entity5			1
ahead of saturday ’s @entity7 final against @entity8 , @entity0 strongly defended the @entity1 manager and insisted the @entity12 boss ’s scathing comments in february were baseless			1
‘ if you analyse everything he has done for this club , if he is a failure — i have a different opinion			2
‘ when they are right , maybe you can accept that everybody makes mistakes			0
but when he ( @entity2 ) comes in a certain way , i do n’t like it			2
we do n’t need to answer to anybody			0
’ however , @entity0 has questioned @entity1 ’s policy of offering only 12 - month contracts to players over 30			2
the 32 - year - old , who will discuss his future with @entity5 after the final , has a year left on his contract but was not part of the renewal drive that led to @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 signing new deals			0
@entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t value players by age , whether it is @entity57 or @entity58			1
‘ i analyse many other things before age			0
for the club , age can be an asset			0
for me , a much bigger asset is someone who has played over 125 games in three years , compared to someone who has played 25 and is 20			0
worrying times : @entity5 has come under pressure for @entity1 's nine - year trophy drought age does n't matter : @entity0 says he judges the likes of @entity57 and @entity58 the same , despite age differences ‘ i understand the club ’s point of view : “ @entity0 is not a £ 25million player because he is not 22 any more ”			1
but i know what i can give			0
’ meanwhile , @entity76 has called time on his career at @entity12 after labelling @entity2 a ‘ fool ’ for a jibe about his age			1
in february , @entity2 was filmed by @entity83 tv saying : ‘ @entity76 is 32 years old , maybe 35 , who knows ? ’ mocking : @entity85 reacted to his manager 's suggestion that he is old by using the corner flag as a walking stick rival strikers : @entity91 ( right ) and @entity92 ( left ) have been competing with @entity85 for a place in the starting line - up but @entity76 , whose contract expires next month , hit back yesterday , saying : ‘ i am 33 years old			1
and it is not because a fool called me an old man that you must believe it			1
‘ and you may have noticed that the old man was better than the youngsters			0
