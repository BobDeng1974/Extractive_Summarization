by @entity0 last updated at 12:59 am on 4th october 2011 they assembled their legions like @entity4 generals on a battlefield : @entity6 , one of the wealthiest men in the world , versus @entity9 , once regarded as the @entity11 ’s most powerful oligarch			1
among their armouries were some of the nation ’s finest and most expensive legal brains , a battalion of personal bodyguards , mountains of paperwork and evidence … not to mention a couple of classy looking redheads			0
against a backdrop of the @entity26 in @entity27 , this was day one of what looks set to become @entity30 ’s most epic legal wrangle			0
accused : @entity31 owner @entity6 arrives at the @entity26 with his entourage for the start of the case against @entity9 mr @entity6 is being sued by mr @entity9 for alleged breach of trust and breach of contract over the @entity40 share deal and at a cost of something like £ 50 a second when it opened yesterday , probably among its most expensive			1
at stake is not just the question of a £ 3.2billion damages claim against the celebrated @entity31 owner , but the reputations and credibility of both men , once said to have been friends and business partners			2
@entity9 accuses @entity6 of having ‘ betrayed and blackmailed ’ him over the sale of oil shares , ‘ intimidating ’ him into getting rid of them at a fraction of their true value			1
the 65 - year - old , who fled to @entity30 from @entity4 11 years ago after falling out with those in power , alleges breach of trust and breach of contract over the deal , struck after the collapse of communism during the 1990s			0
yesterday @entity68 , for @entity9 , told mrs @entity69 the two men had worked together to acquire @entity4 oil company @entity40			1
‘ this is a case about two men who worked together to acquire an asset that would make them wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of most people , ’ he said			0
' @entity77 intimidated ' : mr @entity9 ( centre ) leaves the court after claiming mr @entity6 ' betrayed and blackmailed ' him over £ 3.2billion of oil shares support : mr @entity9 was joined in the @entity26 by girlfriend @entity82 ( centre ) and security guards they were ‘ good friends ’ until @entity9 became an enemy of the @entity87 through his increasingly political profile and his ownership of influential media outlets			1
the oligarch says he was forced to sell his shares in @entity40 and in the @entity4 aluminium giant @entity93 before leaving the country , for fear they would fall into the hands of @entity4 authorities			2
@entity6 , said the @entity99 , ‘ was in effect required to make a choice – to remain loyal to mr @entity9 ... or instead , as we submit , to betray mr @entity9 and to seek to profit from his difficulties			1
‘ it is our case that mr @entity6 at that point demonstrated that he was a man to whom wealth and influence mattered more than friendship and loyalty			0
’ turning point : it is alleged mr @entity6 betrayed mr @entity9 after the latter fell out of favour with political leaders at the @entity87 , then led by president @entity116 ( above ) six years ago the @entity31 owner , currently said to be worth £ 10.3billion , sold @entity40 to @entity4 ’s state - owned gas monopoly in a multi-billion dollar deal now he denies @entity9 ’s claims and insists the two men were never friends or partners			1
he says he had simply hired @entity9 to protect him from @entity124 criminal gangs as the initial deal went through			1
his lawyers have yet to outline their case in court , but in written arguments before the judge they said @entity9 ’s accusations were ‘ devoid of merit ’ and his evidence had ‘ an overtly political purpose ’			2
mr @entity6 , pictured with girlfriend @entity135 in 2009 and watching @entity31 in action ( right ) , bought the football club in 2003 the complex story of everyday @entity4 billionaires unfolded as the two men sat 20 yards apart			0

@entity151 , whose security men include @entity153 , filled his side of the court			0
legal fees are thought to have topped £ 1million for the five hours the court sat. the case is expected to last up to three months .			2
