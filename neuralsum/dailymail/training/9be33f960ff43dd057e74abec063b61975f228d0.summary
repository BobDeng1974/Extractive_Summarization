a hard - hitting experiment has revealed how strangers react differently when seeing domestic abuse depending on the gender of the aggressor			1
a video filmed with hidden cameras at a @entity8 park shows a male actor attacking his ‘ girlfriend ’ in front of onlookers who immediately rush to help , with one shouting : ‘ @entity15 , what 's wrong with you ? ’ the man is told ‘ someone will call the police if you carry on doing that to someone ’ , before a passer - by says to the woman : ‘ you do n't have to put up with that honey , he 's not worth it ’			1
’ however , instead of reacting with shock , nobody watching even attempts to help the man			2
they actually seem rather entertained by the incident , stopping to stare and laughing about it			0
the videos were filmed with three hidden cameras on may 16 for the @entity62 , a charity based in @entity63 , @entity64 , which aims to provide support for male victims of domestic abuse			1
the clip was made just days after multi-millionaire rap mogul @entity69 was punched and kicked by his wife @entity70 ’s sister @entity70 during a violent confrontation in a lift in @entity73			0
role reversal : the experiment was then conducted with the same actors - but this time , the woman is the aggressor , attacking him and saying : ' do n't try to walk away - listen to me when i 'm talking to you ' different scenario : instead of reacting with shock , nobody watching even attempts to help the man funny ? onlookers actually seem rather entertained by the incident , stopping to stare and laughing about it in footage captured on @entity90 , @entity70 lashed out on several occasions with her arms and legs and at one point appeared to kick her brother - in - law			1
@entity70 looked on during the assault			0
the @entity62 runs a national violence helpline for men , and released the video as part of its # @entity102 campaign on @entity103			0
