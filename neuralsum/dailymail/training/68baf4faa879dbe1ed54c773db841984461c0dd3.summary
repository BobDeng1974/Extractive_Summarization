by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 18:44 est , 14 may 2013 @entity1 has plunged down a league table measuring international standards of living			1
in a sign of the hard times facing families , the @entity5 said the @entity1 has dropped from fifth in 2005 to 12th in 2011			1
the league table of the world ’s wealthiest nations , using the latest available official figures , is based on how much money households have after paying their taxes and what they can afford to buy with their spare cash			0
fall : @entity1 has fallen down the household league table from fifth in 2005 to 12th in the new 2011 table while @entity1 used to be beaten only by @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , it is now trumped by a much longer list of countries including @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
while average incomes have risen in @entity1 , they have increased by more in rival nations			1
at the same time , the price of goods has risen by a higher margin in @entity1 – meaning we can buy less with our salaries compared with people in other countries			1
the @entity5 ’s research is based on what it calls each person ’s ‘ actual household disposable income ’			0
this is defined as their total income – not only their salary but also other items such as interest on their savings – minus their tax bill			0
it also includes the value of any free ‘ benefits ’ received from the government , such as @entity62 treatment and education			0
but the total figure is then adjusted to take account of the prices of goods and services in each country			0
plunging economic fortunes : @entity71 and chancellor @entity72 were today hit by the news that @entity1 has slipped down the global family income league table , caused by the economic crisis in @entity1 , the average disposable income for 2011 is given as £ 18,291 , which has risen slightly from 2005 , when it was £ 17,069			1
but in other countries it has risen much faster , pushing the @entity1 down the league table as it has been rapidly overtaken			2
based on research by the @entity84 , which measures economic and social well - being around the world , the @entity5 report said the @entity1 ’s downfall was primarily fuelled by the collapse in the ‘ purchasing power ’ of households			2
the @entity5 said : ‘ between 2005 and 2011 , the price of goods and services in the @entity1 has increased relative to other countries			1
‘ as a result , although household income in the @entity1 has grown , when compared to other countries that income does n’t stretch so far			1
this goes some way in explaining why the @entity1 ranks relatively lower than it did in 2005			2
’ it comes as a separate report , from the @entity103 bank , warned that millions of families are ‘ at full stretch financially ’ and are being hit by a ‘ squeeze ’ forcing many to ‘ cut back where they can ’			0
around one in two ‘ admitted they would find it difficult to cope if their monthly outgoings increased by up to £ 99 ’			0
others are even more hard - pressed , with their finances so finely balanced they would be tipped over the edge with just a £ 24 increase in monthly bills			0
@entity118 , director of personal current accounts at @entity103 , said : ‘ rising prices are putting disposable income under increasing pressure			0
jobless : this table shows unemployment rates in the @entity84 states in 2011			0
the @entity1 went from 12th place in 2005 to 21st in 2011 comparison : this table shows gdp per head in all the major economies			1
the @entity1 is ranked 14th in the table of 30 states ‘ with essentials such as mortgages and rental payments , food and energy bills taking up the largest chunk of household spending , it leaves some households with little room for manoeuvre			2
’ @entity144 , general secretary of the @entity145 , said : ‘ the combination of recession and austerity has taken its toll on household finances , with income levels in the @entity1 falling behind many of its @entity152 neighbours			2
‘ even before the recession , household spending in the @entity1 was far more reliant on debt than in other advanced economies			1
‘ in order to address this as a country we need to obsess less about housing bubbles and focus instead on securing decent pay rises and creating better - paid jobs			0

@entity1 family incomes fell relative to other leading economies
@entity1 public sector debt *rocketed* from 41.1 **%** of @entity129 in 2000 to *85* **%** in 2011
*inflation* in the @entity1 was high compared with the @entity22 , @entity30 and @entity25
