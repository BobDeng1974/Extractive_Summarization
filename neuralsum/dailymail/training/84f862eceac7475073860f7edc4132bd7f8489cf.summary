by @entity0 @entity1 believes @entity2 is destined to become a world - class star rather than @entity5 's next ' sicknote '			1
with the retirement of @entity7 and @entity8 , @entity2 now has a chance to nail down a place in @entity11 's starting xi - providing he stays fit			2
@entity2 was hailed as @entity5 's next big thing when he won his first cap aged 18 , but injury has since limited his career - just as it did to @entity1 , who picked up the unwanted nickname of ' sicknote ' following a series of lay - offs			1
we go again ! @entity2 trains with teammates ahead of @entity5 's qualifier against @entity23 next in line : @entity2 , speaking with @entity11 , can cement a place in midfield if he stays fit @entity1 thinks pundits like @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 have been too quick to criticise @entity2 for not yet fulfilling his potential			1
the former @entity32 and @entity5 midfielder , speaking on behalf of official @entity5 team sponsor @entity33 , is convinced @entity2 has the potential to become one of the best midfielders in the world			2
' if someone like @entity2 can steer clear of injury for six months , he will become a world - class player , ' said @entity1 , whose international career was restricted to just 30 appearances			1
' i understand what @entity28 was saying			0
yes , he has n't gone forward from the player that burst on to the scene , but some of that is down to injury			0
@entity49 : @entity1 's career for club and country was blighted by a succession of injuries fragile : @entity2 has a habit of picking up injuries while away on international duty ' it takes time to get your match sharpness back			1
' i have been through that			0
when you come back people want to see that same player straight away , but it 's tough			0
players just do n't get time			0
' @entity1 feels @entity2 should look to his @entity69 team - mate @entity68 for inspiration			1
@entity68 broke his leg in horrific fashion against @entity73 in 2010 , but he has since become one of the best midfielders in the @entity76			2
box to box : @entity2 was unfortunate not to win a penalty in last week 's friendly against @entity81 role model : @entity69 teammate @entity68 ( @entity83 ) has successfully returned from injury ' @entity68 was out for a while with an injury , he came back , he did n't play well for six months and the @entity69 fans were on his back , but look at him now , ' @entity1 said			1
' the same thing can happen with @entity2			0
he is a similar player - if not better in terms of quality			0
' * to win front row tickets to watch @entity5 v @entity93 , go to @entity95			0

@entity5 face @entity23 in opening @entity98 qualifier on monday
@entity2 can become world class if he steers clear of injury , says @entity1
@entity1 picked up the nickname of ' sicknote ' after a succession of injuries for club and country
