@entity1 will not be able to continue as @entity3 leader until 2020 , @entity0 warned today as speculation over the prime minister 's future mounted			1
last week mr @entity1 vowed to serve ' every day ' of a second term if he is re-elected on may 7 , right up to the next election at the end of the decade			1
but mr @entity0 , himself a former leader , today insisted that mr @entity1 will have to stand before that to allow time for his successor to be chosen			1
the remarks triggered the start of an unofficial @entity3 leadership race , after he also tipped @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 as potential successors			1
the @entity3 leader joked : ' terms are like shredded wheat : two are wonderful but three might just be too many			1
' the admission , in an interview with the @entity36 , caused dismay in large parts of the @entity3 party because it distracted from the party 's core election message on the economy , and over-shadowed last week 's news that inflation had fallen to zero per cent			1
mr @entity1 defended his remarks , insisting he was ' just giving an honest answer to an honest question '			1
challenged on the @entity49 / @entity48 election debate , he insisted : ' if you vote conservative i 've said i will serve every day of a full second term			1
' but at the very least he would need to stand aside several months before may 2020 to give his successor time to prepare for the general election			2
there has been speculation that mr @entity1 could quit after his promised 2017 referendum on leaving the @entity59 , whatever the outcome			2
mr @entity0 , the @entity61 , told @entity63 's @entity62 the pm would choose the timing of his departure and he would be ' sorry to see him go '			2
@entity1 has revealed he will not seek a third term if he wins the next election on may 7 mr @entity1 backed @entity26 , @entity28 and @entity27 as potential successors when he quits as @entity3 leader asked if mr @entity1 has to ' stand down at some point during the next @entity72 ' in order to allow a successor to be in place for the election , mr @entity0 said : ' he does			1
but i have huge faith in the prime minister			0
i think , given the nature of the terrible circumstances we inherited , under his leadership he 's turned the economy around and taken some tough decisions			0
' he will do what he says , which is he will serve what essentially is a full term			2
of course , there will be a competition at some point , but i have to tell you that will be a competition on the back of a successful prime minister doing something that most prime ministers have never done before - saying ' i know when it 's time to go '			0
' you 've had to literally rap the knuckles of people like @entity103 and previous prime ministers to get them to think of going			0
he is actually very keen to say ' there is a limit			0
there 's an amount of time a prime minister should serve before they get stale			2
' and he is right about that			0
' in the @entity36 interview when the @entity3 leader announced his plans to stand down , @entity113 made a rare appearance on screen to endorse her husband as the right man to lead the country mr @entity0 was @entity3 leader from 2001 to 2003 , when he was forced out in a vote of no confidence			1
he said it was ' a different world ' then , as the prime minister was at that point able to select the date of the election and it was ' very difficult to say what a full term was '			0
the @entity133 had allowed prime ministers to plan ahead with certainty about how long their term might be , he said			0
mr @entity0 refused to be drawn on the identity of possible successors , but suggested that it would be someone who is already in the public eye			2
' i do n't think that you 're going to have in any shape or form a brand - new leader that the country has never seen , because all the people that might want to stand for that will have been up in the public sphere for some time , ' he said			0
' i 'm not going to name names			0
i know that those who want to throw their hat in the ring will throw it very hard and those that do n't will think about it			0

@entity1 stunned @entity3 party by *ruling* out seeking a third term
insisted he will serve ' every day ' up to 2020 if he is re-elected on may 7
but @entity0 says he will have to stand down earlier
@entity167 tipped @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 as leaders
