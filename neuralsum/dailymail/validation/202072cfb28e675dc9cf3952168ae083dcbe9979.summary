@entity0 will be forced to ' take it a little bit easy ' in training on monday , counting the cost of playing ' one - and - a - quarter test matches ' in their 23 - 16 defeat to @entity7			1
head coach @entity8 conceded he would hand his shattered players extra time to recover as @entity0 come to terms with their ' straight - up ' lesson in failing to convert pressure into tries			2
@entity0 can still win the @entity15 on points difference if they beat @entity17 in @entity18 handsomely on saturday , despite blowing their @entity20 chances in @entity7			1
@entity0 are feeling the strain after a narrow defeat to @entity7 that ended their @entity20 chances @entity7 dash @entity0 's @entity20 hopes @entity24 boss @entity8 believes the carrot of retaining the championship title for the first time since 1949 will allow @entity0 to shake off their frustrations from saturday 's @entity30 loss			1
' probably monday we might have to take it a little bit easy on the back of there being a lot of ball in play , ' said @entity8 , who confirmed no new injury worries			2
' there were a lot of long phases of play , we probably played one - and - a - quarter @entity45 matches in the context of some of the other @entity45 we 've played			1
' and there 's a lesson we 've got straight - up - if you 're going to play like that then you 've got to be able to keep going in those moments that you do get pressure on them			0
' the players all left the field able to play , but they 'll have some bruises for sure which will limit anything we do ( on monday )			0
' @entity0 's starkest lesson from saturday 's aborted @entity20 bid surrounded killer instinct , or the lack of it			2
former @entity65 boss @entity8 has already admitted @entity0 ' did n't achieve anything ' by expecting to see off @entity7 by accumulating penalties in @entity68			1
@entity8 admitted there were plenty of tired bodies in the @entity73 camp , and said he would take things easy @entity0 , @entity7 and @entity75 can all still now claim the @entity15 title , but @entity8 continued to warn his side about being sidetracked by trying to gauge what points difference could secure further glory			1
' we learned from those 10 wins and we will learn from this loss as well , ' said @entity8 , after @entity0 suffered their first loss since 13 - 10 defeat to @entity75 in last year 's @entity15			1
' what we can learn is that we wo n't lack for character , we do n't lack for endeavour and those are important starting points			0
' what we do know is we are still in the championship and we still have a fantastic opportunity to do something that has n't been done for a long time if we can create enough opportunities in @entity96 next week			0
the match against @entity7 was a bruising encounter , with @entity0 failing to take their chances ' but if you go looking for differentials without first of all making sure you have targeted the result , you are going to make it a pretty tough day for yourself			2
' @entity8 admitted he will push his @entity0 side to sharpen up their attacking accuracy this week in a bid to combat the blunt edge that emerged against @entity7			1
' it 's funny because people were talking about us not making enough line breaks , not making enough passes , even though we 'd obviously made more than any other team and i think that would definitely be true after saturday , ' said @entity8			0
' i felt we showed fantastic endeavour , but that accuracy is what we 're going to need and that 's what we 'll work on this week , ' we did n't quite get our rhythm and if you do n't quite get that right against a defensive side that @entity7 have , particularly their ability to be very physical			0
' i felt we did a lot of that right , but not enough of it right to convert it into points			0
' two @entity73 defenders feel the full force of @entity132 in a game @entity8 admitted took plenty out of his team			0

@entity0 lost @entity20 hopes with 23 - 16 defeat to @entity7
@entity8 claims the effort was like playing ' one - and - a - quarter @entity45 '
@entity0 can still win championship if they beat @entity17 *convincingly*
