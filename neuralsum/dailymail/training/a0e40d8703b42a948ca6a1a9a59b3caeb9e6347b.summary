by @entity0 published : 20:24 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 02:56 est , 6 december 2012 hundreds of doctors ’ surgeries are too cramped and ‘ not fit for purpose ’ , a report warns			1
rooms in some are so close together that patients worry that confidential discussions can be overheard in the waiting area			2
other surgeries have poor heating systems and have not bothered to install ramps or wide doors to enable easy - access for the elderly or disabled			1
' cramped ' : patients in some surgeries feared their confidential discussions with their doctor could be overheard in the waiting area a report by the @entity19 also warned that there may be shortages of @entity22 in future with a high number approaching retirement age			1
up to one in ten family doctors in @entity27 are over 60 , although in some parts of the country it is up to a quarter			0
the report - which specifically looked at gp practices in @entity33 - said ‘ major ’ improvements were needed to cope with the higher numbers of patients			1
in particular it said surgeries needed to stay open for longer and ensure patients knew who to contact out - of - hours			1
it also advised surgeries to employ higher numbers of staff such as practice nurses and health visitors to reduce the work - load for family doctors			1
@entity49 , director of policy at @entity19 , said : ‘ while there are some excellent general practices in @entity33 , the quality of care that @entity54 receive is not as consistently good as it could be			1
‘ there is huge potential to make better use of information and data to understand and address variations in performance			0
‘ i hope this report will encourage @entity22 to engage in a discussion about how to lead a transformation in general practice to ensure all @entity54 enjoy the best possible health care			2
’ warning : the @entity19 report focused on @entity33 , but there is evidence of surgeries across the country in an equally poor state dr @entity74 , assistant medical director at @entity33 and a gp , said : ‘ @entity19 report recognises the excellent service offered by @entity22 across the capital but calls upon us to consider the transformation of primary health care in @entity33 , taking into account the changing population and varied , increasing demands			1
’ the study also found that a third of patients in some parts of @entity27 were unhappy about being overheard in the waiting room while they were being seen by their gp			1
on average 27 per cent of patients in @entity33 said they were worried about this lack of privacy but in @entity95 , @entity96 , it was as high as 34 per cent			2
the report said that surgeries which were too small or ‘ not fit for purpose ’ would not be able to provide good care			2
although the study mainly focused in @entity33 , there is evidence that surgeries across @entity27 are in an equally poor state			0
an investigation by @entity107 in 2010 found that the as many as one in seven practice buildings were ‘ substandard			2
’ and one @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 in @entity113 , said nine of its surgeries were in such a poor state they needed to be totally rebuilt			0
