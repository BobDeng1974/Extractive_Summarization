by @entity0 and @entity1 a major investigation is under way at @entity4 and acting chief executive dr @entity5 has stepped down another hospital could be at the centre of a @entity9 - type scandal after ' discrepancies ' were found in the way patient deaths were recorded			1
experts fear cases of septicaemia have been incorrectly listed at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
four times as many cases of blood poisoning were recorded than would normally be expected at the hospital in a year			1
around 800 cases were recorded between march 2011 and april 2012 , although a similar - sized trust would expect to have just 200			2
this has raised questions about whether some patients may have been recorded as dying from septicaemia when they also had other conditions that should have been treated or prevented			1
a death from septicaemia is classed differently to one from , say , pneumonia , where more questions are likely to be raised as to why it happened			2
a major investigation is now under way and dr @entity5 , acting chief executive of @entity4 , has stepped down			1
dr @entity5 was in charge of recording the information			1
it came on the eve of a crunch meeting for much - maligned @entity43 boss sir @entity42 , who is refusing to quit despite presiding over catastrophe at @entity45			2
sir @entity42 ’s fate lies in the hands of the 19 directors on the @entity50 , which will hold its first meeting since the @entity52 into the @entity54 scandal on thursday			0
campaigners whose loved - ones died unnecessarily at @entity9 and other hospitals are expected to picket the @entity16 conference tomorrow morning			1
in a speech to health professionals today @entity59 said that workers should not wait for @entity64 recommendations to implement a change of attitudes towards care in the health service			2
the discrepancies at @entity4 were identified by the independent health watchdog , dr @entity71 , which compiles mortality statistics for all trusts each year			1
investigation : it is feared that since 2001 an estimated 2,000 - plus patients may have died unnecessarily while being cared for by @entity15 today in a statement , @entity4 said : ' the issue is the way in which some conditions and some causes of death were recorded on the @entity4 ’s administrative system			1
it does not change the number of people who have died			0
' and it does not change the facts or reliability of a patient ’s death certificate			0
' it continued : ' we do not believe that there are any clinical concerns regarding the care of patients , but rather there are questions that need answering about how the trust reports information about their care for administrative and financial purposes			2
pressure : @entity43 boss sir @entity42 will face protests at a @entity50 meeting tomorrow as he resists calls to resign ' the steps we have taken will provide the trust and our community with information about what has happened , any steps that need to be taken and any lessons that may need to be learned			1
the @entity4 will report back on this in public			2
' if @entity4 's deceased patients have been coded incorrectly as dying from septicaemia - when they had a different cause of death - it could have a drastic impact on the @entity4 's death figures			1
the coding could also affect income , as hospitals receive money for results and types of illnesses - and septicaemia receives a higher payments than other infections			0
dr @entity71 and @entity4 's @entity134 ( @entity134 ) are now investigating the septicaemia cases			1
their report , which is supported by @entity50 and professor sir @entity138 , the @entity139 's national medical director , is expected to be completed on march 6			0
it is too early to say why the @entity4 had so many cases of septicaemia , but the @entity134 said its interim findings for 50 of the cases show ' cause for concern '			1
it is believed patients ' records could have been coded incorrectly causing the ' discrepancies '			0
after six years as one of the worst performing trusts for death rates , @entity4 recorded a significant improvement in 2011 and the death rate was in line with expectations for a trust of that size , according to dr @entity71 figures			1
on monday , the @entity4 's interim chairman @entity161 informed staff that dr @entity5 had ' stepped aside ' to ' allow a fully independent view to be taken '			1
mr @entity161 , who was appointed by health watchdog monitor after the @entity4 was put in the highest risk rating for governance and finance , said an independent team would be brought in to look at coding practices			2
dr @entity171 , chairman of @entity172 , said it first became aware of the ' unusually high ' number of septicaemia cases in october and commissioned dr @entity71 to carry out an independent audit			2
investigation : death rates at trusts all over the @entity139 are being looked at after up to 1,200 patients died unnecessarily in @entity45 between 2005 and 2008 @entity181 : groups like ' @entity43 ' have been created in the wake of the scandal , led by campaigner @entity185 , pictured in front of a memorial wall for the dead @entity134 chiefs discussed concerns with the @entity191 , quality experts from the @entity193 in the @entity195 , @entity196 and the @entity194 on january 24			1
dr @entity171 said : ' while we are keen to wait for the final report , we are sufficiently concerned by the interim findings to commence further investigations , and to inform the chair of the trust			0
' when the final report is available on march 6 , we will present the findings openly and transparently , reflecting the fact that the @entity4 public are our main concern and priority			2
' the new scandal comes just weeks after a public inquiry into @entity211 found up to 1,200 patients died needlessly between 2005 and 2008 because bosses put government targets ahead of patient safety			0
the @entity43 chief executive is already under pressure to quit after presiding over the scandal			1
sir @entity42 was previously head of @entity218 between 2005 and 2006 – the body supervising @entity220 – but failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care			0
campaigners whose loved - ones died unnecessarily at @entity9 and other hospitals are expected to picket the @entity16 conference tomorrow morning			1
campaigners have called for him to quit his £ 211,000 post , which he has held for six years , following the public inquiry into the failings			0
tomorrow morning cure the @entity43 will stage a silent protest outside the meeting in @entity16 to demand sir @entity42 be held to account			1
its founder , @entity185 , said the campaign group would demonstrate at every board meeting until the under - fire civil servant resigned or was sacked			0
meanwhile the chair of the public inquiry into the ' disaster ' at @entity45 said culture change in the @entity43 must happen immediately			1
@entity59 today reiterated some of his recommendations in the damning report this month , including his call for a registration database for healthcare support workers			2
' is n’t it odd that the security guard at the door of the hospital , the driver of the minicab who takes you there , have more regulation attached to them and more sanction available to their supervision than does the support worker who is cleaning the bottom of your grandmother ? ' he said			0
culture change in the @entity43 should happen immediately , the chair of the public inquiry into the ' disaster ' at @entity45 said			1
@entity59 ( right ) said that healthcare workers should not wait for @entity64 recommendations to implement a change of attitudes towards care in the health service			0
mr @entity273 ’s report into @entity211 highlighted the ' appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people ' between 2005 and 2009			0
he made a total of 290 sweeping recommendations for healthcare regulators , providers and the government			0
in his first public appearance since publishing the report , mr @entity273 told healthcare professionals at @entity284 : ' we are of course waiting for the government ’s response to the recommendations			0
' but why are we waiting ? there is much in this report that does n’t require a change of law , it does n’t require a policy guidance from the @entity194			0
' it does n’t require anything other than a change of attitude on the part of people			0
' everyone in this room who has a job in the health service can walk out and actually start doing something that makes a difference			0
' mr @entity273 said the ' first and foremost ' thing that healthcare workers could do was to listen to those who have complaints because ' there is almost always something you can do about it '			0
he also reiterated some of his recommendations , including his call for a registration database for healthcare support workers , saying : ' is n’t it odd that the security guard at the door of the hospital , the driver of the minicab who takes you there , have more regulation attached to them and more sanction available to their supervision than does the support worker who is cleaning the bottom of your grandmother ? ' we have to have a system where those who are unfit for the job are excluded from doing so			0
' he said that patients should be put first in a set of values which each healthcare worker should commit to			0
he also said there should be “ no tolerance ” for breaches of fundamental standards in care			0
quoting @entity352 , who said it was a strange principle to have to say that the very first requirement of a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm , mr @entity273 said : “ also in 1860 there she was saying ‘ what ca n’t be cured must be endured is the very worst and most dangerous maxim for a nurse ’			1
' unfortunately we have now found that it was a maxim that was prevalent in the @entity364 at numerous levels even today			0
' @entity43 medical director professor sir @entity138 said : ' if we ’re to have an open and accountable @entity43 , where patients and the public know how @entity43 hospitals are doing , those hospitals must behave openly and honestly about their performance			1
' ' there are clear national guidelines on how death rates should be recorded , and i expect all @entity43 hospitals to follow them			2

four times as many cases of blood poisoning were recorded than would normally be expected at the hospital in a year
