by @entity0 published : 19:13 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 29 october 2013 as a handsome brown and white pony called @entity4 trots smartly around the riding school , it ’s impossible to tell he was once close to death			1
three years ago , though , this shiny pony was one of 110 emaciated horses found starving on a farm in the south - west of @entity11			1
he was so thin and hungry his body had digested all its muscle			1
his skeletal frame was , quite literally , just skin and bones			1
although frightened by their approach , he bore strangers no grudge			2
he lapped up the kindness of volunteers at the rescue centre where he was taken , and responded well to months of physiotherapy and treatment for his damaged liver			2
saved : @entity0 with @entity28 , aged 14 , who when rescued was terribly thin and needed surgery because his terminally ill owner had not been able to care for him , but is now a picture of health today , as he trots around the school , he is happy to do everything that ’s asked of him			2
all he asks in return is a little bit of loving care			2
as i watch him being put through his paces , i hope fervently that someone will offer this sweet chap a home			2
@entity47 is one of 65 horses being cared for at the @entity49 at @entity50 in @entity51			1
a few weeks ago , princess @entity52 visited this inspiring place and adopted a horse			2
she took one lucky @entity56 cob called @entity57 back to her @entity59 estate , @entity60 , where the mare is now enjoying life as a hacking horse for the princess royal			2
@entity57 was certainly due a bit of luck			2
she was brought to the charity because her owners were not looking after her properly			2
having run out of money to care for her , they rang the horse charity for help			2
even then , it was n’t all plain sailing			2
twice , @entity57 was found new homes ; but both times she was returned to the charity when her new owners ’ changed circumstances meant they could no longer keep her			2
as the recession puts families under greater financial pressure , so more and more horses like @entity57 have been neglected or abandoned			1
some 7,000 horses are at risk of serious neglect this winter , according to @entity49 , which is appealing for the public to help			1
rescue centres are full to bursting			2
@entity50 has already taken in 24 per cent more horses this year than last — and they fear more may arrive as the weather gets colder and people feel the pinch			1
royal approval : a keen rider , princess @entity52 is a trustee of the charity and even adopted a @entity56 cob called @entity57 a couple of weeks ago and took her back to her @entity59 estate yet if they are to take in more rescue cases , they desperately need people to come forward to give ponies like @entity47 a caring home			2
@entity47 was one of six young ponies taken in by the centre after a member of the public reported an owner who had been breeding them on her farm			1
the situation had got completely out of hand and she had more ponies than she could possibly look after			2
@entity115 , manager of the rescue centre , explains that the reason for neglect is hardly ever straightforward malice			1
it is more often a case of financial hardship , or owners ’ health problems leaving them unable adequately to care for their horses			1
the centre tries not to pass judgment , because behind every neglected horse there is usually an equally sad human story			0
@entity47 was just two years old when he came to @entity50 and soon became a favourite with staff			1
‘ he was very , very scared , ’ recalls @entity115			0
‘ he had nothing holding his skeletal frame together — we had to rebuild him from scratch			0
but he was the most inquisitive of the group and quickly learned to trust			0
‘ horses are so forgiving			1
they do n’t realise that people have inflicted this on them , so as soon as someone is kind to them , they become quite trusting			0
’ @entity47 had liver damage , because when horses are left to fend for themselves , they start foraging for anything to eat			1
if they are unlucky , they end up eating harmful plants like ragwort			0
often people who abandon horses in a field think they can survive by eating grass			1
but in winter , the grass runs out and what does grow has little nutritional value , and then horses will eat anything in a desperate attempt to stay alive			1
as temperatures plummet , their bodies burn more and more energy to keep warm			0
without hay or other sustenance , they soon digest all their fat reserves , then start to break down muscle , too			0
transformation : @entity176 , left , was one of 26 bedraggled horses found in a field in march with painfully overgrown feet and full of worms and lice and , right , she is now happy , healthy and looking for a new home when things reach this desperate stage , a horse may become too weak to stand and , as it lies prone in the field , insects and birds will prey on it			1
too frail to move , hypothermia and dehydration will set in and its organs will fail			0
it is a horrifying way to die			0
but because the cost of putting a horse down humanely can be hundreds of pounds , people in financial difficulties do sometimes leave horses to perish like this			1
then , it is up to rescue charities like the @entity49 centre to pick up the @entity203 is now nearly five years old and going well as a riding pony			1
in the right hands , he would be an ideal candidate for a child or teenager in a @entity209 , or simply as a pony to take on a hack through local woods and fields			0
@entity47 ’s handler takes off his saddle and gives him a post-exercise rub down as a noble - looking chestnut called @entity28 is led out from another stable			0
only his slightly uncertain step gives a clue to his past			0
@entity28 was one of ten horses who fell into a terrible state because their owner was terminally ill. too proud to ask for help until it was almost too late , the man eventually called the charity			1
@entity28 , aged 14 , was terribly thin , had never been handled ( trained or ridden ) or had his hooves trimmed			0
he needed surgery to remove a growth from the side of his foot and treatment for a broken tooth which was sticking into his cheek			0
now , however , he is a gleaming picture of health , and getting used to being led around			0
he still walks a little uncertainly because the wastage of his muscles has affected his balance			0
by next spring , staff hope that he will have completed his rehabilitation and be ready for a new home			0
but individual success stories like @entity28 aside , the charity is adamant nothing less than a major change in attitudes to horse ownership is needed			0
just as any responsible person thinking of getting a dog would consider going to @entity259 ’ home or a similar rescue charity before buying a puppy , so horse - lovers should consider taking a horse from a rescue centre before perusing the local ‘ @entity267 ’ ads. for until more prospective horse - owners consider adopting an unwanted horse , rather than buying from a breeder or dealer , the problem of horse neglect will not get better			1
to understand just how bad the problem of over-breeding and abandonment has become , look no further than the case of @entity278			0
this friendly black and white horse was one of a group of 40 horses who were found on a plot of land near @entity286 in january 2012			1
you may have heard of fly - tipping , but did you know there is now something called fly - grazing ? horses bred by irresponsible dealers who then find they are unable to sell them are being dumped like so many unwanted tyres onto common land			1
skin and bones : many abandoned horse simply starve to death as temperatures plummet , their bodies burn more and more energy to keep warm and without hay or other sustenance , they soon digest all their fat reserves near to where i keep my horses in @entity311 , i ’ve seen live horses dumped on grassy roundabouts , and even on the verges of slip roads leading to the @entity316			1
when they were called out to @entity286 , @entity50 only had the capacity to take two of the starving colts found there			1
one of them was @entity278			0
happily , other charities picked up the rest			0
they believe they know who dumped the horses but can not prove it			1
successfully prosecuting for such behaviour is virtually impossible			0
the desperate plight of abandoned horses in @entity332 is a scandal			1
some welfare experts believe local authorities will have to consider culls of abandoned horses if the crisis reaches the level it has in @entity340 , where animal charities have now reluctantly called for such a move			1
for now , @entity47 and @entity278 need new homes — as do all the horses the charity takes in , if it is to go on helping other animals who are suffering this winter			1
nearly all of those waiting for a home are rideable			0
none of them have been abandoned through any fault of their own			0
take @entity176 , a pretty , white , three - year - old with the most loving temperament you could wish for			1
she was one of 26 bedraggled horses found in a field in march — yet more victims of someone breeding horses for sale in a climate where there is very little demand for them			1
all the ponies had painfully overgrown feet and were full of worms and lice			0
restored to health , @entity176 is a delight			0
she sticks her nose over the door of her stable and plants a sloppy kiss on my face , before nibbling my hand gently			0
she is so sweet and affectionate i want to take her home right now , but i restrain myself			0
i have three of my own to care for			0
i pat @entity176 and tell her to hang on in there			0
i hope she finds the home she so clearly deserves soon .			0

some 7,000 horses are at risk of serious neglect this winter , according to @entity49 , which is appealing for the public to help
the @entity50 in @entity51 has already taken in 24 *%* more horses this year than last and they fear more may arrive with winter weather
