in the first month of the ruling taking effect , 60 per cent of the @entity15 - wide requests came from fraudsters , criminals and sex offenders and one in ten reportedly came from paedophiles			1
the @entity11 's ‘ right to be forgotten ’ legislation allows @entity15 citizens to request that links to ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ’ information be removed from @entity0 search results requests from @entity6 included a former clergyman who wanted to remove links to articles about a sex abuse investigation and a doctor who botched a medical procedure			1

@entity60 publisher @entity59 said : ‘ it is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you do n’t like			0

@entity0 also refused an application from a doctor who wanted more than 50 links to articles about a botched procedure removed			0
