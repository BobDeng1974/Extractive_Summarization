@entity0 could be denied @entity2 football in their final season at @entity4 by the ill - discipline of their @entity7 rivals in the knockout rounds of this year ’s continental competitions			1
the top three nations in @entity13 ’s @entity12 and @entity10 rankings qualify for a @entity16 place ahead of next term			1
@entity18 were third behind @entity19 and @entity20 before the latter stages of the @entity22 and @entity16 resumed this month			1
@entity23 's @entity0 are currently top of the @entity10 table but could miss out on the @entity16 @entity0 are two points ahead of @entity27 and @entity28 in the @entity7 @entity10 rankings @entity30 : @entity31 & yellow cards , @entity33 : positive play , @entity35 : respect towards opponent , @entity36 : respect towards referee , @entity38 : behaviour of officials , pts : points , avg : average were they to stay there then the @entity7 would award a @entity16 place to the team which tops their own @entity10 table			1
that is currently @entity23 's @entity0 , who sign off from @entity4 after 112 years before moving to the @entity51 at the end of next season			2
@entity54 qualified via the same route in 2011 and took their place in the inaugural @entity16			2
@entity27 currently trail the @entity0 by 2.25 points , which are awarded for disciplinary record , positive play , respect towards opponents and referees and the behaviour of team officials			0
the ill - discipline of other @entity7 clubs could harm @entity0 's chances of a place in @entity13 the @entity13 @entity10 rankings show @entity18 in third place behind the @entity19 and @entity20 but sources at the @entity7 believe there is a danger they will lose their extra @entity16 spot given the combative nature of knockout - round ties			1
@entity13 – who take into account all international and club matches in their competitions - use the same criteria as the @entity7 but also include the behaviour of fans in the stadium			0
that has not been an issue for @entity89 clubs of late but on - the - pitch misdemeanours could make a difference when @entity13 ’s final table is published in may			0
for example , @entity93 had @entity95 sent off during tuesday ’s 2 - 1 defeat to @entity97			0
next season is @entity0 's last at @entity4 after 112 years , before they move to the @entity51 on the other hand , were a @entity7 club to go on and win the @entity22 or @entity16 playing attacking football and avoiding too many cautions , then @entity18 could yet climb @entity13 ’s table			1
meanwhile , it is @entity28 and @entity93 who occupy third and fourth positions respectively in the @entity7 standings			0
were they to finish top then the @entity16 place would go to the next team who had not yet qualified for @entity2 competition			1
however , given that entry is at the first qualifying round – which begins on july 2 - clubs can refuse the offer			0
in this instance the association would lose their extra allocation			0
as from 2016/17 there will no longer be a @entity16 prize for the top three nations			2
instead , a financial bonus will be paid to the best @entity10 association , the most improved and the nation with the best behaved spectators .			0

@entity0 are top of the @entity7 ' respect and @entity10 ' rankings
the top three nations in the rankings qualify for a @entity16 place
@entity18 are currently third , but @entity0 will need to rely on their rivals avoiding misdemeanours in continental competitions this season
