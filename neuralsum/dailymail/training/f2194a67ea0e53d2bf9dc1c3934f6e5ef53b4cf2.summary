@entity43 has ordered 10,000 troops into the streets to protect sensitive sites after last week 's bloodshed that left 17 people dead			2

@entity25 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) @entity9 grew up in a specialist boarding school in the tourist village of @entity114 after their parents both died @entity117 who helped raise the orphaned pair at a school in the holiday village of @entity114 recalls them as happy , popular and trustworthy children who had little interest in religion			1
the pair , who are of @entity43 - @entity126 descent , were sent to the @entity128 centre in the picturesque @entity129 in 1994 by their mother , who was unable to raise them after their father died suddenly			2
once at the boarding school , which specialises is raising children with social needs , they were largely isolated from the outside world			2

the group , which also included deli attacker @entity170 , 32 , was lead by two radical @entity171 who preached jihad			0
speaking about @entity6 's move to @entity50 , ms @entity117 told @entity175 : ' he joined up with little groups of hooligans			1
' they ran rings around him because he was relatively fragile and allowed himself to be led by the nose			0
