it was his old room before he fled the country in 2001 , following a brutal bar fight which almost cost him his life			2

' the fisherman 's remarkable story hit the headlines after he washed ashore late last month			0
he claims he set off on a shark fishing trip from the @entity165 region of @entity166 , but after winds blew him off course , he spent the next 14 - months drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch			2
having told doctors that he had kept himself alive by eating raw fish , the flesh of sea birds and turtles and drinking their blood and his own urine , there was concern about his kidneys and liver			2
while he looked in remarkably good health and overall condition when seen on the atoll of @entity184 after coming ashore for the first time since he had set out on an ill - fated fishing expedition , his health deteriorated when he was brought to @entity96 in the @entity79			2
such was the concern of doctors that a day after he was released from hospital and taken to a lagoon - side hotel to relax he was returned to hospital and placed on a rehydration drip			0
preparations : the family gets ready for a reunion then he was taken back to the hotel as arrangements were made to fly him home to his family			2
a police guard was placed outside his room to prevent journalists talking to him and every step was taken to ensure that details of his return journey did not leak out			2
an @entity207 diplomat who flew from @entity208 brought with him a special passport - making kit , allowing him to prepare an emergency passport for @entity5 so he could pass through @entity133 airports on the way home			0
