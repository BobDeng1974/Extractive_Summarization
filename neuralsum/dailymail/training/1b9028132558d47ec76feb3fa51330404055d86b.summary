by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:17 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 03:13 est , 28 january 2013 incoming @entity4 governor @entity3 has given the clearest signal yet he is willing to see higher inflation for longer to support economic growth			1
speaking at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , mr @entity3 indicated he was prepared to see inflation , which is currently running at 2.7 per cent , remain higher than the government 's two per cent goal for longer if it means output can be increased faster			1
he said : ' if you are coming from above [ the inflation target ] and you have a fiscal consolidation you might take a little longer to get back given the issues with output			2
' @entity21 : @entity22 expressed support for radical policy and self - sustainability mr @entity3 was unveiled in november as the surprise choice to succeed sir @entity27 but has rarely spoken about monetary policy ahead of his taking over in july			1
while interest rates have remained at a record low of 0.5 per cent for almost four years , the @entity4 has pumped £ 375billion into the economy via quantitative easing – printing money			0
economists are looking to the @entity35 to lift the economy out of the doldrums , where it languishes 3.3 per cent below its peak before the 2008 recession			0
a report from the @entity42 last week fuelled fears that @entity44 is sliding towards a triple - dip recession			2
two thirds of smaller firms who trade online and export goods overseas are confident of growing sales this year , according to a study			0
a survey of more than 330 companies by the @entity54 found that markets in the @entity56 and @entity57 were top targets , followed by @entity35 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
@entity61 , managing director of @entity62 , said : ' @entity54 's study shows @entity44 online retailers will be actively seeking new international markets in 2013 to help them achieve their growth plans			1
' mr @entity3 's comments were met with some surprise in the @entity69 last night			1
@entity70 , of @entity71 , said : ' i was surprised to see mr @entity3 so vociferous , considering his feet are not under sir @entity27 's table yet			1
' [ but his ] thinking is not wholly different to that of the existing @entity4 management			0
' the new @entity4 governor today insisted that ideas on monetary policy were not yet ' maxed out ' , in a radical speech at @entity9			2
@entity3 , who will remain head of @entity35 's central bank until july , said the world 's major economies needed to achieve ' escape velocity ' - in which growth becomes self - sustaining			1
his speech advocated a dramatically looser system to that supported by sir @entity91 , who had implied there was little more he could do to boost growth			0
mr @entity3 said central banks do not have the powers to ' to take all of these risks out to get a sustainable recovery '			1
it will come as good news to @entity100 , boosting the @entity102 ' deficit cutting programme			1
' do n't relax ' : @entity104 head @entity103 told banking chiefs to keep up momentum ' you internalise the fiscal stance in the monetary policy mix , ' said mr @entity3			1
' monetary policy is more nimble than fiscal policy			0
' his call to arms came as @entity104 head @entity103 urged a closing panel : ' do not relax			1
' she said the @entity104 outlook for a ' fragile and timid ' recovery depended on officials in the powerhouse economies of @entity57 , the @entity56 and @entity120 making ' the right decisions			2
' and it seems that mr @entity3 will not shy away from difficult subjects , as he confronted those who suggested that monetary policy was impotent			1
made the cut : chancellor @entity100 will be pleased mr @entity3 supports domestic deficit reduction in a direct rejection of a comment from @entity129 , secretary - general of the @entity130 , he said : ' i would take issue with @entity129 in saying that monetary policy is maxed out			1
' there continue to be monetary policy options in all major economies and they have to be framed in the context of the [ monetary policy ] mandate			1
' the fiery banking chief emphasised ' flexible inflation targeting ' for developed countries , using ' communication ' and ' other unconventional instruments ' to allow achieve price stability and sustainable growth over time			2
he underlined his activist approach by adding : ' the role of central bank is to determine the optimal path to return inflation to target taking into account all the broader impacts on the economy and the impact on financial vulnerability , including the global financial situation			0
' the meeting of 2,500 business , financial and political leaders took place in a more upbeat atmosphere than last year			0
fears over the breakup the euro currency union have eased , while the @entity56 has avoided the ' fiscal cliff ' of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that threatened to push the world 's largest economy back into recession			0
the @entity104 estimates that the world economy will grow about 3.5 per cent this year , modestly better than last year 's 3.2 per cent			2
yet the improvement is uneven , with the eurozone and @entity120 in recession , although the @entity56 is growing , and emerging economies such as @entity177 are expanding much more quickly			0
@entity103 said the eurozone was still in ' a very fragile situation ' that was made more risky through a slow decision - making process and occasional backtracking on initiatives			2
' good decisions have been made , ' she said			0
' sometimes at the last minute , as in the @entity56 , sometimes laborious and confusingly as in the eurozone			0
in 2013 they have to keep up the momentum '			0
