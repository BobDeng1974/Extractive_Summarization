a @entity1 mp has demanded prime minister @entity2 provides evidence that he is no longer a @entity4 citizen			1
@entity5 , mp for @entity6 in @entity7 , questioned the pm over whether he is still a dual citizen after being contacted ‘ on numerous occasions on social media ’ by blogger @entity8 , from the @entity9			1
mr @entity2 was born in @entity12 , @entity13 , in 1957 to an @entity15 mother and @entity17 father and came to @entity15 in 1960 as an assisted migrant			1
he applied for @entity15 citizenship in 1981 , becoming a dual citizen of @entity15 and @entity4 , and then reportedly – on an undisclosed date – renounced his @entity4 citizenship			1
if mr @entity2 is still a @entity4 citizen he would not be eligible to be prime minister			1
the blogger previously reportedly submitted a @entity34 request to the prime minister 's office and the @entity36 seeking a copy of mr @entity2 ’s @entity39 form			1
the form is used by @entity4 subjects to renounce their citizenship			0
as part of the @entity15 constitution , people who hold dual citizenship are not permitted to stand for election to @entity48			1
in his email to @entity50 , mr @entity8 wrote : ‘ the @entity51 and @entity52 declared in an @entity34 request , 2014 - 159 , in october last year , that mr @entity2 is still a dual citizen of @entity4 and @entity15			1
’ ms @entity5 is thought to be the only mp who responded to mr @entity8 ’s email			1
she promised to write to mr @entity2 and ask him to provide the requested @entity39 form as evidence			2
ms @entity5 sent the letter on friday and asked him to provide mr @entity59 ' with a copy of the declaration of renunciation ' that he received when he renounced his @entity4 citizenship in her letter to the mr @entity2 on friday , ms @entity5 wrote : ' i have received an email from a mr @entity68 who asserts that you have yet to renounce your @entity4 citizenship , i enclose my response to mr @entity8			1
' i make no claim that you are ineligible to sit in the @entity74 , that your election was void , or that you have failed to renounce your @entity4 citizenship			0
i have seen no evidence that would satisfy me of any such claim ( s )			0
' however , i also have no desire to continue to receive , and respond to , communications questioning your eligibility under section 44 ( i ) of the @entity82			0
' for that reason , i believe it would assist if you would provide mr @entity8 with a copy of the declaration of renunciation that you received after renouncing your citizenship			2
alternatively , it would assist if you would advise the date of your renunciation			0
‘ thank you , in advance , for considering this letter			0
' however , a spokesperson for ms @entity5 told @entity95 the mp believes ‘ it ’s a non-issue ’			2
he confirmed ms @entity5 has not received a response yet , but highlighted the letter was ‘ only posted on friday			2
’ ‘ @entity5 ’s got no view on @entity2 ’s citizenship , ’ the spokesperson said			0
‘ he ’d [ @entity8 ] contacted her on numerous occasions on social media and she was just making sure the guy got some sort of reply , ’ he explained			0
‘ @entity5 believes the battleground with the @entity108 is on policy and ideology not on citizenship , she ’d be highly surprised if he was n’t a citizen in the 2013 election … she wo n’t be taking any further action			0
‘ she was just making sure this guy got a reply from a parliamentary representative , she does n’t think it is an issue or ever was an issue			0
mr @entity2 ( centre ) applied for @entity15 citizenship in 1981 , becoming a dual citizen of @entity15 and @entity4 , and studied at @entity123 in @entity13 the @entity2 's office previously denied that mr @entity2 ( right , next to @entity4 prime minister @entity125 ) is still a dual citizen ‘ she stated clearly in her letter we should be concerned on policies and ideologues , ’ the spokesperson added			1
@entity95 has contacted the @entity132 for comment			0
meanwhile , a @entity135 petition demanding ' show the public your @entity4 citizenship renunciation form ' currently has over 25,000 signatures			0
the petition reads : ' @entity139 forbids anyone holding dual citizenship from being elected to @entity48			0
@entity2 's refusal ( under @entity34 request ) to provide his form @entity39 renouncing his @entity4 citizenship before being elected ( 26 march 1994 ) , raises serious questions about his legality as a member of parliament			1
' on september 18 2014 , @entity148 requested to see mr @entity2 's official confirmation of renunciation of @entity4 citizenship under the @entity152			1
mp @entity5 has explained that she just wants to help mr @entity2 ' put the issue to bed ' her request was denied by @entity156 , the assistant secretary of the @entity157 , because ' no documents relevant to the request are in the possession of the @entity161 '			2
the @entity161 and @entity52 said ' no relevant documents were found ' when they searched for them			0
also in september , @entity164 were told by the @entity132 and the @entity165 and @entity52 that mr @entity2 has renounced his @entity4 citizenship			2
' the prime minister is an @entity15 citizen and does not hold citizenship of any other country , ' the @entity161 reportedly said .			2
