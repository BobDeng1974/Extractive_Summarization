@entity0 , the woman who underwent a face transplant after she was mauled by her friend 's chimpanzee , has revealed in a newly - released video that she feels like she is locked in a cage			1
she appeared in the footage in a last - ditch appeal to legislators to sue the state for $ 150 million , saying the attack that robbed her of her hands , her sight and much of her face has left her life forever changed			1
' it ’s a different world to not be able to see again or to use your hands and just do things for yourself			0
that you have to depend on other people for help now , it ’s very hard , ' @entity19 said			2
' i feel like i ’m locked up			0
i feel like i ’m in a cage			0
she says the state had the authority and obligation to seize the dangerous animal			2
the state generally is immune to lawsuits , unless allowed by the claims commissioner			1
the legislative panel is scheduled to meet friday to hear testimony on a bill that would override the june decision by @entity54 @entity53 , who dismissed @entity19 ’s request for permission to sue the state government			1
@entity19 also may appear in person at friday ’s hearing			2
' i ’m hoping that the legislation will allow me to have my day in court , that i will be able to have a judge listen to the evidence that is brought before him about the vicious attack on me and that it shall not happen to any other person again , ' @entity19 says on the video			1
difficult : in her video , @entity19 demonstrates how basic tasks - like getting around - are hard because she is now blind from the attack final plea : @entity19 is pleading with lawmakers to give her the chance to bring her case before a judge in her room at a @entity81 convalescent center , where she is awaiting a second attempt at a hand transplant , @entity19 describes the difficulties she has endured over the past five years			1
the 60 - year - old single mother was blinded , lost both hands and underwent a face transplant following the attack in @entity90			1
@entity19 went to the home of the chimp ’s owner , @entity92 , on feb. 16 , 2009 , to help her friend and employer lure the 200 - pound animal , known as @entity96 , back inside			1
but the chimpanzee went berserk and ripped off @entity19 ’s nose , lips , eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer			1
@entity19 reached a $ 4 million settlement in 2012 with the estate of @entity106 , who died in 2010			2
@entity19 ’s attorneys say that will only cover a small portion of her medical costs			2
violent : @entity19 , pictured before the attack ( right ) , was attacked by her friend 's chimp @entity96 ( left ) in 2009 injuries : she was left with a thumb on one hand and lost the other hand between her wrist and elbow denied : @entity31 claims commissioner @entity53 denied @entity19 the permission to sue the state of @entity31 it is unusual for state lawmakers to overturn denials issued by the state claims commissioner , but @entity19 hopes her appeal will resonate			1
' it ’s a shame that this attack had to happen , unfortunately , ' she said			0
' but now i ’m trying to work the best i can to have my sanity			0
i want to be as normal as i can be			0
' in an appeal of @entity53 ’s decision , @entity19 ’s lawyers in july claimed the state law that was in place at the time of @entity19 ’s attack prohibited the ownership of primates weighing more than 50 pounds without a permit			1
the state @entity146 had the ' unequivocal authority to seize an animal whose existence threatened public health and safety , ' @entity19 ’s attorneys wrote			2
because the chimp was owned illegally by @entity106 the lawyers contend the state was obligated to seize it			0
life changing : an illustration , left , shows how @entity19 's face was damaged in the attack - she lost her eyes , nose and lips			1
but the transplant , right , gave her back these features intense : a team of more than 30 physicians , nurses , residents and other clinical staff are pictured at work during the 20 hour procedure at @entity174 in @entity175 after the transplant : she underwent a face transplant in 2011 , pictured , and was given glass eyes months before the attack , a state biologist warned state officials in a memo that the chimpanzee could seriously hurt someone if it felt threatened , saying ' it is an accident waiting to happen			1
' @entity53 concluded that no law at the time of the attack prevented @entity106 from owning the chimpanzee			0
he added : ' if there was a failure by the @entity193 ( now referred to as @entity146 ) to seize the animal … the duty owed was to the general public and does not create a statutory obligation to ensure the safety of a private individual			0
' state attorney general @entity200 has said state law on the issue was ambiguous and difficult to enforce			0
in the video distributed to state legislators , @entity19 is seen attempting to navigate down a hallway of the nursing home , feeling her way along the wall			2
' i really miss seeing a whole lot , ' she said			0
' i think there ’d be so much more i could be doing handicapped if i could see what i was doing			0
i think i could figure out how i could use a foot or a toe to do something			0
not being able to see makes it a lot harder			0

@entity0 lost her eyes , nose , mouth and hands when she was attacked by a friend 's chimpanzee in @entity31 in 2009

but in a new seven - minute video , @entity19 urges lawmakers to overrule the commissioner 's decision
