a @entity1 cyclist has broken the land speed record on a bicycle by attaching a hydrogen - peroxide rocket to the frame			1
@entity6 from @entity7 recorded a top speed of 163mph ( 263kph ) on his self - built vehicle on an old runway in @entity11 in @entity12			1
this record beat his previous mark of 150 mph ( 242.6kph ) , set in 2002 , and just missed out on the powered bike speed record set in 1995 by the @entity17 bike by @entity18 ( 5kph )			1
@entity6 recorded a top speed of 163mph which beat his previous mark of 150 mph , set in 2002			1
he just missed out on the powered bike speed record set in 1995 by the @entity17 bike by 3mph cyclist @entity6 recorded a top speed of 163mph on his self - built vehicle with help from @entity31			1
he broke the record on an old runway in @entity11 in @entity34 in the @entity7 region of @entity12 concentrated liquid hydrogen peroxide flows into a storage tank that contains a catalyst			1
this catalyst is usually a material such as silver			2
the decomposition catalyst causes the hydrogen peroxide to decompose into water steam and oxygen			0
this reaction heats the gas mixture to around 650 degrees			0
the hot steam is then pushed through a nozzle attached to the end of the rock and this provides the thrust need to push the bicycle forward			1
the velocity of the gas flow after the nozzle becomes well over 1000 m / s and gives the rocket a considerable reaction force thrust			1
the gas mixture after the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide contains oxygen			0
the thrust force is increased if this oxygen is used to burn an organic fuel , before it is released through the @entity67 fuel can be a liquid , such as pure alcohol called ethanol that is sprayed in after the catalyst chamber			0
or it can be a solid , such as a rod of polyethylene placed after the catalyst chamber			0
source : @entity77 @entity6 designed the bike himself while @entity79 company @entity31 ( @entity80 ) and engineer @entity81 designed the rocket that propelled it @entity31 's rocket used hydrogen peroxide and is called an ' ecological monopropellant motor			1
' the rocket works by putting concentrated liquid hydrogen peroxide into a storage tank that contains a catalyst			2
the fuel can be a liquid , such as pure alcohol called ethanol that is sprayed in after the catalyst chamber			0
these kind of rockets are called bipropellant liquid fuel rockets			0
or the fuel can be solid , such as a rod of polyethylene placed after the catalyst chamber			0
such a rocket is called a hybrid rocket			2
the decomposition catalyst causes the hydrogen peroxide to decompose into water steam and oxygen			0
this reaction heats the gas mixture to around 650 degrees			0
the hot steam is then pushed through a nozzle attached to the end of the rock and this provides the thrust need to push the bicycle forward			2
the velocity of the gas flow after the nozzle becomes well over 1000 m / s and gives the rocket a considerable reaction force thrust			2
the gas mixture after the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide contains oxygen			0
the thrust force is increased if this oxygen is used to burn an organic fuel , before it is released through the nozzle			0
the record was set at the @entity130 in @entity34 in the @entity7 region of @entity12			1
the speed was officially recorded using a gps tracker fitted to the bike 's handlebars			1
in the video posted on @entity137 , @entity6 is shown zooming passed a speeding car during his record - breaking ride			1
@entity31 's rocket used hydrogen peroxide			2
it works by putting concentrated liquid hydrogen peroxide into a storage tank that contains a catalyst			0
the catalyst causes a decomposition that releases hot gases which are pushed through the rocket 's nozzle to give it thrust			2

cyclist @entity6 topped speeds of 163mph ( 263kph ) on this rocket - powered bicycle
this land speed bike record beat the previous mark set in 2002 by 13mph
