hosting 30 heads of @entity6 units of foreign companies at his @entity13 , @entity4 pledged that taxes would not rise later and vat and duty rules for firms would be streamlined this year			1
the @entity19 president , who last month announced @entity6 would phase out £ 25billion in charges on companies by 2017 to reverse its slide in competitiveness , also said @entity6 business taxes would be harmonised with those of its neighbours , especially @entity28 , by 2020			1
@entity6 president @entity4 pledged that taxes would not rise later and vat and duty rules for firms would be streamlined ' the objective is to ensure the stability of tax standards and mechanisms , ' @entity4 told leaders of @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , among others			1
' i know that @entity6 , and this was confirmed by our discussions , is seen as a more complicated country than others			0
' a business , whether @entity6 or foreign , that wants to invest will have a commitment from the administration that the tax rules will remain the same , and that will be a guarantee			1
' the government believes a rebound in company investment can help boost growth in @entity6 ’s @entity60 to at least 0.9 per cent this year after stagnation in 2013			0
it hopes that even such modest growth will help bring down joblessness from near 11 per cent			0
@entity6 has a reputation for tense industrial relations and frequent run - ins with business			0
file picture monday ’s meeting aimed to reassure foreign business leaders unnerved by @entity6 ’s high overall tax rate , history of tense industrial relations and frequent run - ins with business such as his government ’s threat in 2012 to nationalise an ailing steel plant run by @entity81			2
but his comments to the business leaders came the same day as a new law was introduced in parliament to impose tough fines on firms that shut operations still deemed economically viable			0
the law was prompted by @entity4 ’s 2012 campaign promise to steelworkers at @entity81 ’s @entity93 blast furnaces in northern @entity6 that he would pass legislation to protect their jobs in case of a shutdown			2
despite a government threat to nationalise them , the furnaces were later closed .			0
