by @entity0 compensation : april @entity2 , 24 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , had a normal pregnancy with her first child @entity6 , carrying him to full - term - but he was born stillborn after an error by midwives the mother of a baby boy who was delivered stillborn after midwives missed signs that his heart was beating too slowly has spoken of her heartbreak in the hope no other parent will go through the same ordeal			1
april @entity2 , 24 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , had a normal pregnancy with her first child @entity6 , carrying him to full - term			1
but during labour , two midwives at the @entity19 failed to notice that her baby son had a fatal condition , bradycardia			1
it meant @entity6 had an unusually slow heart rate and was delivered stillborn			1
now the mother - of - two has been given an undisclosed amount of compensation by the @entity29 after it made an admission of liability			0
miss @entity2 's lawyers started legal action against the trust alleging that , if the condition had been detected , @entity6 could have been given a quicker delivery			1
the lawyers said it would have meant @entity6 could have been resuscitated 15 minutes earlier , increasing his chance of survival			1
miss @entity2 said : ' it breaks my heart to know that if @entity6 ’s slow heart rate had been detected during my labour , the midwives could have delivered him quickly and i would have him here with me now			1
' i have really struggled to come to terms with what happened and i hope that through what happened with @entity6 that all of the maternity staff at the hospital have had additional training to ensure that lessons can be learned			1
' throughout her labour , @entity2 was monitored by a trainee midwife and a supervisor			1
but medical records show @entity6 ’s heart rate was not taken after 10.45am , half an hour before he was born			1
when @entity6 was born , staff began to resuscitate him but he could not be saved			2
miss @entity2 said : ' i had no problems throughout my pregnancy			2
' whilst i was at the hospital during labour , i felt that the midwives were not monitoring me and @entity6 as they should have been doing , but i thought i have to put my trust in the hospital staff to take care of me and my baby			1
' when i finally delivered @entity6 , i immediately noticed he did n’t cry or make any sound at all			2
i kept asking the midwives what was wrong with him as they rubbed his chest to stimulate his breathing			0
' suddenly the crash team arrived and they tried to revive him in front of me and my dad			0
i just wanted to be able to hold my newborn son			0
warning : @entity79 miss @entity2 had a normal pregnancy and carried her son full - term , but complication ensued during @entity6 's labour at the @entity19			1
her son is pictured in this scan image ' nothing could bring @entity6 back or begin to make up for what happened but knowing that everything possible has been done to prevent another baby from dying might mean we can finally lay him to rest and try to begin the long process of rebuilding our lives			2
' after his death , @entity2 continued to visit the hospital to see her son until he was taken for a post-mortem			2
she took photographs with her son that she now treasures in a family photo album			2
the post mortem revealed her little boy ’s heart rate had slowed down half - an - hour before she gave birth			1
miss @entity2 said : ' i had gone into labour the evening before and was pacing up and down at home			2
' i first went into hospital at 4am but was sent home because i was n’t dilated enough			0
i went back in at 6am and stayed there after progressing further into labour			0
' she added : ' when he was delivered , it was a odd because my baby was n’t passed to me , he was placed on the bed between my knees and the midwife walked out of the room			0
' at first i smiled and was happy to have a baby boy but i then i realised he was not breathing			0
i started screaming that he was n’t breathing and the trainee hit the button to call for the crash team , who immediately rushed into the room			0
' @entity2 , 24 , has been paid an undisclosed amount by the @entity29 after her first child @entity6 , with whom she is pictured , was delivered stillborn			1
she released this image of him @entity2 , who now has children @entity128 , two , and @entity129 , nine weeks , started legal action in an attempt to move on with her life			0
april ’s lawyers at @entity134 took the case again the trust , alleging that staff failed to pick up @entity6 's slow heart rate , a sign that the foetus is in distress and struggling			1
lawyers suggested that , if the midwives had picked up @entity6 ’s slow heart rate , they would have performed an assisted delivery , meaning @entity6 would have been born sooner			1
the lawyers added that the heart rate readings were taken by the trainee midwife and did not appear to have been checked by the supervising midwife			1
the final allegation was that the supervising midwife had not undergone the necessary training to supervise a trainee midwife @entity154 , a specialist medical lawyer at @entity134 ’s @entity156 office , said : ' this is a tragic case that has seen april absolutely devastated by the loss of her son @entity6 and she understandably wants answers about what went wrong			1
' april has found it incredibly hard to accept what happened and has needed extensive support to help her come to terms with her loss			0
' what is clear is that the midwives made a number of errors and failed to detect basic signs which would have showed them things were n’t right and ultimately led to @entity6 being stillborn			2
' it is difficult for the family to come to terms with the fact his death could have been avoided			0
' we welcome the fact the trust has admitted responsibility and we back april ’s calls to see that the trust has made improvements to maternity services to protect patient safety			0
' we have assisted her reporting the substandard care to the nursing and midwifery council and we hope that their investigation will highlight the hospitals failings and ensure appropriate measures are put in place to stop this happening again			0
' miss @entity2 now hopes lessons will be learned from what happened to her			0
she said : ' i knew i was right			0
i knew something had gone wrong			0
but it hurts because what i should have is a three - year - old boy with me today			0
' but no matter what i do , nothing can ever get me that back			0
' according to the @entity208 , the trust , which runs @entity19 , admitted ' on the balance of probability ' that @entity6 's bradycardia was missed during the birth			1
chief nurse @entity213 , for @entity29 , said : ' we would like to reiterate our sincere condolences to ms hall on the tragic loss of her son , @entity6			2
' @entity219 takes the safety of its patients very seriously and we launched an immediate and thorough investigation into @entity6 ’s stillbirth ; a copy of which was shared with ms hall			2
' although staff did everything that was expected of them , in keeping with nationally accepted practice , we appreciate that this was a very sad and unexpected outcome for ms hall			0
' all through this process we have openly answered any questions that ms @entity2 asked in the wake of @entity6 ’s death and we have offered her our support to deal with her very sad bereavement			1
