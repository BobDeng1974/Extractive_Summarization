the link is so strong that scientists believe blood levels of the vitamin could provide a way of screening patients			0
' @entity16 deficiency could be a biomarker of advanced prostate tumour progression in large segments of the general population , ' said lead scientist dr @entity21 , from @entity22 in the @entity23			1
the study found that @entity26 men of @entity28 origin were 3.66 times more likely to have aggressive prostate cancer if they were vitamin d deficient ' more research is needed , but it would be wise for men to be screened for vitamin d deficiency and treated			1
' the scientists examined data from a wide - ranging group of more than 600 men from the @entity40 area who had risk factors for prostate cancer , such as raised levels of the blood marker @entity45 ( @entity45 ) or a family history of the disease			1

for those of @entity74 origin , lacking vitamin d increased the risk 4.22 times			0
african - americans with severe vitamin d deficiency were also more than twice as likely as those with normal levels of the vitamin to be diagnosed with prostate cancer			0
