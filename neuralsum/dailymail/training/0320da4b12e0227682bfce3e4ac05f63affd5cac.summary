by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:43 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 17 april 2013 @entity2 is trying to recover from a public relations nightmare after a massive technology glitch meant that its entire fleet was grounded yesterday , stranding tens of thousands of angry passengers			1
though the nation 's third - biggest airline has promised to be nearly operational today , the hangover from yesterday 's online reservation system meant that many travelers are still stuck in airports			1
the company has employed the use of social media - especially @entity15 - to do damage control , informing irate passengers on when they might expect to make it to their final destinations			1
that means @entity42 and @entity41 canceled or delayed nearly two - thirds of their scheduled flights after they lost access to a computer system that 's used for everything from issuing boarding passes to determining how much fuel to pump into the plane			1
passengers took to social media sites to criticize the airline , which for hours could only apologize and say that it was trying to fix the problem			1
the man who will lead @entity42 in a few months , @entity62 ceo @entity61 , has said he would prefer to convert his planes and employees to @entity42 's computer system rather than the other way around			1
@entity62 declined to comment on whether tuesday 's breakdown would cause @entity61 to rethink his plans			2
the computer outage began snarling operations around midmorning			0
eventually the @entity73 issued a so - called ground stop for @entity2 jets around the country			1
flights already in the air were allowed to continue to their destinations , but planes on the ground from coast to coast could not take off			2
and travelers could do little to get back in the air until the computer system was restored			2
by late afternoon , @entity42 resumed international flights and those from its major hub airports			1
it scrambled during the evening to put planes and crews in position to get off to a good start on wednesday morning			0
issues : security checks passengers bags at the @entity42 airlines terminal at @entity96 on tuesday ' despite the magnitude of today 's disruption , we are pleased to report that we expect our operation to run normally with only a small number of flight cancellations ' on wednesday , said @entity103 , a spokeswoman for @entity42			1
she said @entity42 would add flights to accommodate stranded passengers			1
@entity42 blamed the outage on a loss of access to computer networks that are used for flight reservations and many other functions			1
airlines commonly rely on such systems to track passengers and bags , monitor who boards planes , and update flight schedules and gate assignments			2
the computers are also used to file flight plans and tell employees which seats should be filled to ensure that the plane is properly balanced			0
@entity42 's system is hosted by @entity127 , a one - time division of @entity42 that was spun off into a separate travel - reservations technology company			1
@entity42 said the outage was n't @entity127 's fault , and other airlines that use @entity127 did n't experience problems			1
at airports , customers whose flights were canceled could n't rebook on a later flight			2
passengers already at the airport were stuck in long lines or killed time in gate areas			0
a lot of people are getting mad			0
i 've seen several yelling at the @entity42 agents , ' said @entity147 , a business - meeting speaker who was stuck at @entity148 waiting for a flight to @entity150			2
' nobody can tell us anything			0
' @entity154 , a tv news consultant from @entity96 who was also stranded in @entity148 , said @entity2 gate employees were doing everything the old - fashioned , manual way because their computers were useless			1
' no one at the counter can do anything			0
they ca n't check people in , ' @entity154 said			0
' the airline is at a dead halt			0
' theoretically , an airline could do the same work as the reservation system manually for any one flight			2
but doing it for hundreds of flights is n't practical			0
@entity42 and @entity41 operate about 3,300 flights a day			1
now , if the reservations systems go down , ' most airlines would be pretty much without the ability to fly more than a very limited number of flights , ' said @entity178 , @entity42 's former technology chief and now a consultant			1
chaos : passengers at the @entity2 counter wait for checking in to their flights at @entity96 on tuesday @entity178 said airlines find and fix the problem , but the next time something else causes an outage			1
one time , a possum chewed through a cable in @entity189 , @entity190 , bringing down the whole system			0
another time , a worker in the airline 's data center used a metal tool instead of an insulated , rubber - coated one - a short - circuit crashed much of the system , he said			1
@entity198 , a professor of aviation technology at @entity200 , said massive system failures are inevitable as airlines grow increasingly reliant on technology			0
' as those systems get bigger and more complex , at some point you 're going to have a systemic failure , ' @entity198 said			0
he added that financially strapped airlines may have underinvested in technology during the past decade , making the computer systems more vulnerable			0
@entity211 has lost more than $ 10 billion since 2001 and filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2011			0
@entity42 's problems on tuesday were reminiscent of what @entity215 passengers endured for several days last year			1
after merging with @entity217 , @entity215 experienced computer glitches in the combined reservation system			0
on one day in august , 580 @entity215 flights were delayed , and its website was shut down for two hours			0
another outage in november delayed 636 flights			0
the problems prompted an apology from @entity227 ceo @entity226 , who acknowledged that his airline had frustrated customers and would need to work to win them back			0
@entity42 began making amends by offering to book people who needed to travel tuesday on other airlines and pay for the fare difference			2
for those who wanted to delay their trips , @entity42 offered refunds or waivers from the usual fee for changing a reservation			2
but for several hours , the airline was n't able to process those changes and refunds - because the computers were down .			0

passengers across the country stranded in planes and airports yesterday as @entity2 's reservations system crashed
third largest @entity42 airline promises to be nearly fully operational today
total of 970 flights were cancelled
passengers took to social media to *voice* numerous complaints
