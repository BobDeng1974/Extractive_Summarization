by @entity1 reporter published : 23:42 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 02:42 est , 2 december 2012 a marine who guarded @entity3 has denied intimidating the @entity5 private while he was held in a brig after being arrested for allegedly sending @entity8 secrets to @entity9 in the biggest security breach in @entity8 history			1
@entity12 recounted an incident where @entity3 had an apparent anxiety attack while being escorted to a recreation area - but said his own behaviour had nothing to do with the breakdown , adding that he was surprised to be told that ' we intimidated him or something like that '			1
however , he also admitted that guards had become annoyed when a protest in @entity3 's favour stopped them returning home on time , though another guard insisted this had not changed the way they treated the prisoner			1
the defense claims the nine months @entity3 - who is charged with sending @entity8 secrets to @entity9 in the biggest security breach in @entity8 history - spent in virtual isolation , sometimes without clothing , amounted to illegal pretrial punishment			1
his turn on the stand : @entity3 seen arriving at a courthouse at military base @entity42 , @entity43 before testifying about the treatment he received during his two - years in prison @entity3 and his attorneys want all the charges dismissed			1
@entity12 testified on the fifth day of a pretrial hearing at @entity42 , near @entity49			2
he was called as a prosecution witness to talk about a jan. 18 , 2011 , incident in which @entity3 hid behind an exercise machine and wept after he was scolded by another guard for failing to respond properly to a command			1
later that day , the brig commander , chief warrant officer 4 @entity56 , added ' suicide risk ' to @entity3 's maximum - custody conditions			1
that was after they had what @entity3 described as a heated argument about the incident			1
@entity12 testified that some brig workers were annoyed that a @entity65 protest a day earlier had closed @entity67 's main gate , forcing them to take alternate routes home			2
goal : @entity3 is trying to avoid trial in the @entity9 case by arguing he was punished enough when he was locked up alone in a small cell for nearly nine months at a brig in @entity67 , @entity76 , and had to sleep naked for several nights @entity12 said he was n't personally affected by it			1
defense attorney @entity79 has implied the guards took out their irritation on @entity3 by bullying him			1
@entity12 and another former guard , @entity83 cpl. @entity83 , both testified that except for the jan. 18 incident , @entity3 was always compliant and respectful			1
another former brig worker , @entity86 gunnery sgt. @entity86 , testified that @entity3 was often uncommunicative and withdrawn , possibly signaling a suicide risk			1
@entity86 testified that before jan. 18 , he had considered recommending to @entity56 that @entity3 be removed from ' prevention - of - injury , ' or @entity90 , status because of his improved behavior			1
@entity3 was on either poi or even more restrictive ' suicide risk ' status during his entire stay at @entity67 in maximum custody			1
his behavior jan. 18 ' gave us cause for concern , ' @entity86 said			2
' that kind of reset things , unfortunately			0

@entity3 being shown a bedsheet as he testified in his pretrial @entity9 hearing @entity3 was at @entity67 from july 2010 to april 2011			1
then he was moved to pretrial confinement at @entity108 , kan. he has been held in medium custody since arriving there			0
the 24 - year - old native of @entity112 , @entity113 , worked as an intelligence analyst in @entity115 in 2009 and 2010			0
he is charged with 22 offenses , including aiding the enemy and violating federal espionage and computer security laws			0
he could get life in prison			0
he is accused of sending to the website @entity9 more than 250,000 diplomatic cables , classified memos , @entity125 and @entity127 war logs , @entity129 prison records and a 2007 video clip of a @entity8 helicopter crew gunning down 11 men			1
it was later determined that one of those men was a news photographer			0
the @entity136 said its troops mistook camera equipment for weapons			0
taking the stand on thursday , @entity3 said that he lost all hope when he was detained for weeks in a segregation tent in @entity143 , an army installation in @entity145 where he was stationed			1
smile : @entity3 was decidedly more excited when he appeared in court for the first time on tuesday ( pictured ) @entity3 said he remembers thinking ' i 'm going to die , i 'm stuck inside this cage			1
' wearing his dress uniform , he appeared nervous , stuttering over his words as he tried to answer questions from a defense attorney about his arrest in @entity115 in may 2010			0
he was testifying only about his arrest and confinement and not about how he leaked classified documents to @entity9			0
seated in the witness booth , he swiveled back and forth and gestured with his hands as he described the layout of his confinement quarters overseas			0
' i was in a pretty stressed situation ... i was getting very little information ' from his attorney while he was being held , he said , noting that he felt increasingly ‘ hopeless ’			0
' i had pretty much given up			0
my world had just shrunk , ' @entity3 said , explaining how he had suicidal thoughts while being held by authorities			2
@entity3 is trying to avoid trial in the @entity9 case by arguing he was punished enough when he was locked up alone in a small cell for nearly nine months at a brig in @entity67 , @entity76 , and had to sleep naked for several nights			1
controversial : supporters stood outside the @entity43 military courthouse where he was due to appear tuesday ' i totally started to fall apart , ' the 24 - year - old said			0
the military contends the treatment was proper , given @entity3 's classification then as a maximum - security detainee who posed a risk of injury to himself or others			1
earlier thursday , a military judge accepted the terms under which @entity3 would plead guilty to eight charges for sending classified documents to the secret - spilling @entity9 website			2
colonel @entity191 's ruling does n't mean the pleas have been formally accepted			0
that could happen in december			0
but @entity191 approved the language of the offenses to which @entity3 would admit			2
she said those offenses carry a total maximum prison term of 16 years			0
@entity3 made the offer as a way of accepting responsibility for the leak			2
make or break : if a judge rules he was tortured then the entire trial could be abandoned , though that is not expected to happen government officials have not said whether they would continue prosecuting him for the other 14 counts he faces , including aiding the enemy			0
that offense carries a maximum penalty of life in prison			0
under the proposal , @entity3 would admit to willfully sending the following material : a battlefield video file , some classified memos , more than 20 iraq war logs , more than 20 @entity127 war logs and other classified materials			2
he would also plead guilty to wrongfully storing classified information			0
meanwhile , @entity3 's lawyers are arguing that the charges against the soldier should be dismissed because of how he was treated while confined at @entity67			2
other prospective witnesses include a military psychiatrist who examined @entity3 at @entity67 , and the former commander of the confinement facility at @entity108 , @entity226 was later moved there , re-evaluated and given a medium - security classification .			2

comes days after @entity3 testified about the treatment he received both in @entity145 holding area and once he returned to @entity76 in the @entity8
said he remembered thinking : ' i 'm going to die , i 'm stuck inside this cage '
