@entity11 in the tourist - heavy area along the @entity10 in @entity3 , this footage shows a woman trying to pressure a holidaymaker into signing a petition , without explaining why or what it is for			1
the woman in the video approaches the videographer , asking if he speaks @entity20 before holding out a pen and encouraging him to sign the paper she ’s holding			1
the footage shows a woman trying to pressure a man into signing a petition , without explaining what it is for ‘ what is it ? ’ the man asks , while recording the interaction			1
she continues to push the paper toward him , getting visibly upset when the man continues to question what exactly it is that she ’s asking him to sign			1
she pushes the pen toward him several more times , despite the man ’s protests , before giving up and stalking off angrily			1
according to the video maker , tourists are targeted by people on the street , who urge them to sign petitions and then demand they make a ‘ donation ’ to the organisation			1
‘ the problem is that there ’s no organisation behind the petition , ’ the man wrote online			1
the filmer is approached by a woman , asking him to sign a petition for an unknown organisation when he asks for more information , including what the petition is for , the woman gets visibly agitated ‘ any money " donated " goes straight into the pockets of the scammers , or worse yet , into the pockets of their over-bosses , typically found in certain @entity72 communities			1
’ the @entity75 capital launched a 26 - point anti-crime strategy in autumn last year and brought in police officers from other @entity79 countries to beef up security at top attractions such as the @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and the @entity85			1
with about 30 million visitors a year , @entity3 police brought in reinforcements from @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 to help to patrol areas visited by tourists			1

the @entity125 service has long had a reputation for being a crime hotspot , but , thankfully , according to the @entity3 police , tourist muggings are down eight per cent over the last year			2
every year foreign visitors are tricked out of small change or , worse , find themselves in dangerous situations or the victims of crime			2
eventually , after pushing the pen toward him several times , she gives up and walks off in a huff while this is by no means a warning against travel , being prepared and on guard can go a long way to evading confidence tricksters , wily locals and credit card bandits			2

on distraction muggings the perpetrators aim to distract you while they rob you			0
for example , a woman with what looks like a baby – it very often is just a doll or bundle of clothes – walks up to you and makes pleas for money for her baby			0

by the time you 've got rid of her you 'll notice your pockets have been pilfered by her accomplice			0

' the battle to curb thefts and mugging in @entity3 in an ongoing one , but officials are constantly developing new programmes to counter these			0
