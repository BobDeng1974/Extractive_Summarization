by @entity0 a gigantic line of powerful thunderstorms could affect one in five @entity4 as it rumbles from @entity5 to @entity7 packing hail , lightning and tree - toppling winds			1
meteorologists are warning that the continuous line of storms may even spawn an unusual weather event called a derecho , which is a massive storm of strong straight - line winds spanning at least 240 miles			1
wednesday 's storms are also likely to generate tornadoes and cause power outages that will be followed by oppressive heat , said @entity20 , operations chief at the @entity22 's @entity21 in @entity23 , @entity24			1
this graphic shows the area of greatest impacts , particularly @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , that will be hit by tornadoes and hail @entity33 down the hatches : the @entity36 is braced for a derecho - these long , flat clouds are often associated with thunderstorms widespread : some 65 million people across 10 states could be affected by a derecho wednesday , a storm where powerful winds stretch hundreds of miles , often causing widespread destruction not again ? forecasters are predicting the derecho to come from a giant wave of thunderstorms in the @entity36			1
last year , a derecho caused $ 1 billion in damages from @entity52 to @entity53 double whammy ? tornadoes are often associated with the same weather systems that produce derechoes			1
pictured is a map of tornado probability during today 's storm and into tomorrow and again ? a huge area is expected to suffer tomorrow , with hail and lightning predicted			2
much of the severe weather may concentrate in @entity66 a derecho is a widespread , long - lived wind storm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms			2
last year 's historic storm saw widespread destruction and meteorologists fear it could be happening again , possibly affecting 64 million people in 10 states.in 2012 , a record - breaking derecho caused $ 1 billion in damage from @entity52 to @entity80 4 million were without power after the june 29 , 2012 storm across 11 states.to be classified as a derecho , the line of storms must travel at least 240 miles and include wind gusts of at least 58 mph			1
2012 's storm saw winds as great as 100 mph			0
it can produce destruction similar to that of tornadoes , while the damage typically is directed in one direction			0
as a result , the term ' straight - line wind damage ' is sometimes used to describe the phenomenon			1
the risk of severe weather in @entity52 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , @entity30 , is roughly 45 times higher than on a normal june day , @entity20 said			2
@entity102 , @entity103 , @entity53 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity107 , have a risk level 15 times more than normal			0
all told , the area the weather service considers to be under heightened risk of dangerous weather includes 64 million people in 10 states			1
' it 's a pretty high threat , ' @entity20 said , who also warned that the storms will produce large hail and dangerous lightning			2
' we do n't want to scare people , but we want them to be aware			0
' wednesday ' might be the worst severe weather outbreak for this part of the country for the year , ' said @entity125 , meteorology director at @entity126			0
he said it is possible to have tornadoes and a derecho at the same time , but at any given place on wednesday the straight - line winds are probably more likely			1
last year , a derecho caused at least $ 1 billion in damage from @entity52 to @entity53 , killing 13 people and leaving more than four million people without power , according to the weather service			1
winds reached nearly 100mph in some places and in addition to the 13 people who died from downed trees , another 34 people died from the heat wave that followed in areas without power			0
@entity146 , with winds of at least 58mph , occur about once a year in the @entity36			0
rarer than tornadoes but with weaker winds , derechoes produce damage over a much wider area			0
thursday : @entity66 is in the crosshairs of tomorrow 's brutal weather adding insult to injury after weeks of soggy @entity158 weather weather experts have warned tree - toppling winds are on their way to the @entity36			0
here an @entity164 tree is down on @entity166 grounds in @entity53 across from the @entity4 @entity167 after a powerful storm swept across the @entity53 region wednesday 's storm probably wo n't be as powerful as 2012 's historic one , but it is expected to cause widespread problems wednesday 's storm probably wo n't be as powerful as 2012 's historic one , but it is expected to cause widespread problems , @entity20 said			2
the storms are the type that will move so fast that ' by the time you see the dark sky and distant thunder you may have only minutes to get to safe shelter , ' @entity20 said			0
the storms will start late morning or early afternoon in eastern @entity5 , hit @entity52 by early afternoon and move east at about 40 mph , @entity20 said			0
forecasters say the risk of severe weather in @entity52 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , @entity30 , is roughly 45 times higher than on a normal june day the @entity185 after their chase vehicles took a direct hit by a violent tornado west of @entity189 satellite image showing a shortwave trough moving across the northern and central plains a storm prediction chart shows all seven weather types are possible today , but high winds are expected to be the main threat if the storm remains intact after crossing the @entity200 , which would be rare for a derecho , it should hit the @entity53 area by late afternoon or early evening , he said			1
for @entity53 , @entity204 and parts of the @entity206 the big storm risk continues and even increases a bit thursday , according to the weather service .			0
