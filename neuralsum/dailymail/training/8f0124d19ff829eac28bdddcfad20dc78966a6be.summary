by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 @entity8 commentator and feminist @entity9 insulted generations of women when she compared marriage to prostitution , a women 's advocate says			1
@entity9 said her comments on @entity14 's q&a on monday night were not aimed at modern wives , but she was speaking about the institution of marriage in the past			2
' i was n't calling them prostitutes ; i was merely saying that old fashioned marriage from that period is uncomfortably close to an economic transaction , ' she told @entity2			1
' why would i say such a thing ? ' @entity9 said on the program : ' i would argue that traditional marriage which included conjugal rights , particularly when women were not able to go to work or were fired when they first got married , and were basically selling their bodies and their reproductive rights to their husband - he bought them by giving her room and board in return - was a form of prostitution			1
' @entity49 spokeswoman on women 's issues , @entity53 , said the comments were offensive to women , including her mother , who she said was a feminist in her time			0
' i was n't calling them prostitutes ; i was merely saying that old fashioned marriage from that period is uncomfortably close to an economic transaction , ' she said ' my very first thought when i first saw it was " i really hope my mother is n't watching this " , ' ms @entity53 told @entity2			1
' it definitely was an insult to previous generations			0
' @entity9 said it was n't until 1882 that women were able to retain their own money when they married			2
she said in some professions women were fired when they got married in @entity78 until the 1970s			0
' these days because women earn their own money and make their own choices and have lots of economic opportunities ... marriage is a really much better institution now than it was , ' @entity9 said			2
the comments were made amongst an all female panel which veered into a debate about sex work last night			0
off the back of recent stories about how journalist @entity92 became a sex worker , the panel was asked : ' what do you think of prostitution as a conscious career choice in a first world country ? ' ms @entity9 engaged in a back - and - forth over the matter with fellow panelist @entity101 author @entity100 fellow panelist @entity101 author @entity100 rejected ms @entity9 's remarks as an ' an abstract comparison ' as some sex workers have up to 15 buyers a day			0
@entity9 also saught to clarift the analogy she ' was clumsily trying to make ' by publishing a column in the @entity108 on tuesday titled ' why housewives are not prostitutes '			2
' i did not want to isolate sex workers as a group , so i sought to broaden the question out to the way all women were caught up in an economic transaction in the past by talking about traditional marriages that included conjugal rights , ' @entity9 wrote			1
she went on to describe the period of time she had been referring to when women had no rights to property or their children and men were lawfully allowed to ' discipline ' their wives			0
' that still did not make the women in such relationships prostitutes but it did make marriage much more about survival than choice , ' she wrote			0
@entity9 also mentioned how until the 70s , women were often fired from their jobs in @entity78 when they either married or became pregnant , saying that it made ' the way society policed marriage uncomfortably close to an economic transaction			1

@entity9 came under fire for her on monday , when she said that housewives in traditional marriages were like prostitutes
*mrs* @entity9 said women in traditional marriages ' basically ( sold ) their bodies and their reproductive rights to their husband '
she claims her analogy was taken out of *context* and that she was saying *historicaly* , marriage was uncomfortably close to an economic transaction
she has since tried to clarify her comments via an article
