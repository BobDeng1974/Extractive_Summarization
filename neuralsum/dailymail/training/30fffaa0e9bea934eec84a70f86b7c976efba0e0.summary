by @entity0 the solar system is rich in asteroids - there are thousands said to be in the vicinity of @entity6 and hundreds of thousands more towards @entity7 , many of which reside in the asteroid belt			1
in a mesmerising animation , astronomer and gamer @entity13 from @entity15 has revealed the multitude of these asteroids that have been spotted since 1980			1
as the animation progresses , more and more asteroids appear which reflects how our capabilities to find them increased dramatically at the turn of the century			2
the animation , with music by @entity25 called @entity26 , shows a model of the inner solar system with various objects in orbit			2
an asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions in the early solar system			0
most are located between @entity36 and @entity7 in the @entity37			2
a comet is a rock covered in ice , methane and other compounds			0
their orbits take them much further out of the solar system			0
a meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up			0
this debris itself is known as a meteoroid			0
most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere			0
if any of this meteoroid makes it to @entity6 , it is called a meteorite			2
@entity62 , meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets			0
at the centre is the sun , and the blue dots in orbit around it are the innermost planets in order : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity6 and @entity36			1
towards the edge of the screen is @entity7 , and between this gas giant and @entity36 is where the asteroid belt is located			1
over time , astronomers have found more than 600,000 asteroids in the inner solar system			1
of these , about 10,000 are @entity6 objects ( @entity6 ) and , in turn , almost 1,500 are @entity85 ( @entity86 )			1
these are ones that are said to potentially pose a threat to @entity6 soon or in hundreds of years			2
according to @entity92 , our planet is currently bombarded with more than 100 tonnes of dust and sand - sized particles every day			0
this graph from @entity92 shows how our capabilities to find asteroids have increased drastically in the 15 years , thanks to new and improved asteroid - hunting telescopes being built on @entity6 and launched into space			1
about 10 per cent of these are potentially hazardous but do n't pose any immediate threat every year , on average , a car - sized asteroid plunges into the atmosphere , burning up before it reaches the surface			2
every 2,000 years , a meteoroid the size of a football field makes it through the atmosphere and hits the ground , causing significant damage			0
and it is estimated that once in a few million years an object large enough to threaten civilisation as we know it enters our atmosphere			0
this latest animation comes just days after a large asteroid dubbed 2014 @entity120 came within 770,000 miles ( 1.25 million km ) of @entity6			1
although there was little to no chance of it hitting @entity6 , it highlights how vulnerable our planet can be to large rocks drifting through space			1
an asteroid ( illustration shown ) is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions in the early solar system			0
most are located between @entity36 and @entity7 in the @entity37 , but a growing number are being found that are locate closer to @entity6 or towards the inner solar system			1

a video shows all asteroids found between the sun and @entity7 in *34* years
@entity15 astronomer @entity13 made the *fascinating* animation
he shows how the number of asteroid discoveries has shot up recently
highlights how many rocks are floating in @entity6 *'s* vicinity and many further
more than 600,000 have been found , of which about 10,000 are ' hazardous '
