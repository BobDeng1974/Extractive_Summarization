@entity0 told a man living in a rural area of @entity3 that it would cost over $ 20,000 to connect him to broadband internet			1
@entity5 of @entity6 moved to the town of 7,000 residents ten years ago , reports arstechnica.com			2
@entity5 , who works as a laboratory analyst at a beer brewery , is just one of the five per cent of @entity12 who live in an area that does n't offer wired internet service other than dial - up			1
unfortunately wireless in @entity5 's only viable option and he never imagined it would be so expensive to obtain			2
not that rural : @entity19 lives in @entity6 @entity3 not far from a main road and just a third of a mile away from @entity0 lines there are @entity0 cable lines less than a mile away from his home but the company still told him it would cost him $ 20,000			1
a letter from @entity0 to @entity5 in april 2012 stated that in order to extend service to his home , cable to three homes in a span of 0.32 miles would need to be built			1
that number adds up to 9.4 homes per mile			0
the letter also says that construction would cost $ 26,470			1
@entity0 would only be willing to chip in $ 3,643 , leaving $ 22,862.60 to be paid by @entity5			1
when @entity5 first moved into his home it only cost him a few hundred dollars to get a copper wire phone service			1
even though the home has a @entity43 landline , @entity40 is n't an option in their area			0
@entity46 is n't an option either			0
high price : a letter from @entity0 to @entity5 in april 2012 stated that in order to extend service to his home , cable to three homes in a span of 0.32 miles would need to be built cost estimates from june 2012 aerial design : $ 310 make ready : $ 5,670 strand and hardware : $ 2,712 splicing and electronics : $ 5,916 coaxial construction : $ 5,719 total cost : $ 26,470 minus the $ 3,643 @entity0 was willing to chip in equaling $ 22,862.60 source : @entity64 ' i would pay $ 1,000 for a fiber - to - the - home installation that promised cutting edge speeds without batting an eye — ok , maybe a small flinch , ' he said			1
' but not $ 20,000			2
' ' i did n’t think it would be that difficult , because the cable was on my road			2
it ’s not completely green acres			1
i do n’t have to go up to the pole to make a call			0
i did n’t think it would be a problem , ' he said			0
as of the now the family pays $ 90 per month for 20 gigabytes of data from @entity84 , a company that resells @entity43 service			0
at this time that 's the best the family can do if they do n't want to use painfully slow dsl networks			0
the family does most of their downloading at a family member ’s home until a better solution comes along			0
rural customers may someday see fixed wireless technology but not at this time			0
ten years ago @entity0 quoted $ 5,000 for service			2
who knows what it will cost years from now ?			0
