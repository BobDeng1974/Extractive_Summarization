by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor and @entity3 president @entity4 promised on friday to end the government 's access to millions of @entity2 ' telephone call data , but launched a strong defense of the @entity10 's performance			1
in a wide - ranging speech that touched on the future of @entity2 intelligence - gathering , the ' damage ' @entity12 's leaks have done and a snipe at @entity19 's feigned outrage over the revelations , he also promised that he would no longer authorize snooping on foreign heads of state			1
' the leaders of our close friends and allies deserve to know that if i want to learn what they think about an issue , i will pick up the phone and call them , rather than turning to surveillance , ' he said			2
@entity4 warned that the ' sensational ' way @entity12 chose to reveal what he knew will have impact @entity2 intelligence and national security ' in ways that we may not fully understand for years to come			2
' ' the same technological advances that allow @entity2 intelligence agencies to pinpoint an @entity66 cell in @entity67 or an email between two terrorists in the @entity70 , ' @entity4 said friday morning in a speech at the @entity72 , ' also mean that many routine communications around the world are within our reach			1
' ' at a time when more and more of our lives are digital , that prospect is disquieting for all of us			0
' and ' the combination of increased digital information and powerful supercomputers , ' he acknowledged , ' offers intelligence agencies the possibility of sifting through massive amounts of bulk data to identify patterns or pursue leads that may thwart impending threats			1
' ' but the government collection and storage of such bulk data also creates a potential for abuse			1
' @entity4 did not recommend whether the government , private telecommunications companies , or third - party groups should control the phone data that the government has collected , but called on attorney general @entity103 , @entity104 and the intelligence community to decide			1
major announcement : @entity4 trimmed the powers of the secretive @entity2 eavesdropping agency friday by calling for new privacy safeguards , but allowed bulk phone data sweeps to continue as an anti-terror tool giving it back : a presidential review panel has recommended taking the data from the @entity10 ( pictured ) and giving it to the telephone companies or a third party - but the companies have balked at the idea a presidential review panel has recommended moving the data outside of the government 's control			1
but phone providers have balked at changes that would put them back in control of the records and expose them to new legal liabilities			0
@entity4 strained to insist that ' the program does not involve the @entity10 examining the phone records of ordinary @entity2			1
' ' rather , it consolidates these records into a database that the government can query if it has a specific lead			0
' but because of the public uproar after @entity12 exposed the initiative , @entity4 will change the parameters of the program to limit fishing expeditions and extend the reach of skeptical judges			1
' effective immediately , ' he said friday , ' we will only pursue phone calls that are two steps removed from a number associated with a terrorist organization instead of three			0
' ' and i have directed the attorney general to work with the @entity152 , ' the president promised , ' so that during this transition period , the database can be queried only after a judicial finding , or in a true emergency			0
' while privacy advocates will cheer the announcement , @entity4 's decision will frustrate some intelligence officials			0
flying the flag : @entity4 hit out at @entity19 for feigning outrage over the leaks while at the same time trying to spy on the @entity2 coming out of the shadows : @entity4 promised greater transparency of the secret services the impact of @entity12 's revelations was felt in the text of @entity4 's speech			1
while he refused to directly comment on the fugitive from justice , the president lobbed broadsides at him without naming names			0
' given the fact of an open investigation , i 'm not going to dwell on mr. @entity12 's actions or motivations , ' he said			0
' our nation 's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation 's secrets			0
' ' if any individual who objects to government policy can take it in their own hands to publicly disclose classified information , then we will not be able to keep our people safe , or conduct foreign policy			0
' he later railed against @entity19 , similarly without identifying the nation by name , when he complained about foreign governments that feign outrage over @entity2 's surveillance program			0
such nations , he said , ' are constantly probing our government and private sector networks , and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations , intercept our emails , or compromise our systems			0
' @entity19 president @entity210 has granted @entity12 temporary asylum , allowing him to evade prosecution in the @entity2 on three felony counts			2
@entity4 's announced changes come at the beginning of a tense political year when democrats face numerous policy obstacles and @entity219 scandals in a bid to maintain control of the @entity222 , which has served as a backstop against @entity224 eager to dismantle @entity4 's first - term agenda – including the @entity227 law			1
shoring up the public 's confidence in the @entity10 's spying operations with the addition of independent oversight , a @entity219 source told @entity234 , is ' in part a move to quiet down the uproar in time for november			2
' @entity238 : @entity4 said the ' damage ' from @entity12 's leaks would be ' felt for years to come ' officials said friday that even after months of studying the surveillance issues , @entity4 was still grappling with his decisions in the hours leading up to the speech			1
what appeared certain was that the @entity10 's phone record gathering would continue in some form , including digital data collection overseas			1
' @entity2 intelligence agencies will only use such data to meet specific security requirements , ' @entity4 promised , including ' counter-intelligence ; counter-terrorism ; counter-proliferation ; cyber-security ; force protection for our troops and allies ; and combating transnational crime , including sanctions evasion ' – a clear warning to @entity263 amid concerns over its growing nuclear program			2
' people around the world – regardless of their nationality – should know that the @entity2 is not spying on ordinary people who do n’t threaten our national security , ' he explained , ' and that we take their privacy concerns into account			0
' ' this applies to foreign leaders as well , ' said @entity4 , in a clear reference to @entity44 chancellor @entity43 , whose phone was being snooped on by the @entity10 , according to leaks from @entity12			1
' given the understandable attention that this issue has received , i have made clear to the intelligence community that – unless there is a compelling national security purpose – we will not monitor the communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies			0
' @entity294 policy analysts offered cautious praise			0
@entity296 , director of the @entity298 's @entity297 , said in a statement that ' many key questions and reforms were left unaddressed ' by @entity4 , ' and many controversies punted to @entity104 or to other government officials			2
' ' to restore the trust in the @entity2 as a responsible steward of the @entity307 , the president should be acting now and forcefully to take the advice of his own handpicked advisory panel , by immediately ending the @entity10 's collection of bulk data and supporting strong reforms			2

president @entity4 announced changes in a speech on friday morning
government control of phone - call data ' creates a potential for abuse , ' he acknowledged
@entity4 would *n't* recommend who should control the digital information , but told ag @entity103 and @entity104 to decide the future of the program
@entity329 came after months - long review following a public *description* of the program by @entity10 leaker @entity12 in 2013
@entity10 initiative is meant to *stockpile* data so it can be mined later to draw lines of *connection* among *suspected* terrorists after they are identified
