by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 07:12 est , 30 may 2012 a mother - of - ten has confessed to receiving more than 50k in unemployment benefits from the government - despite being perfectly capable of going out to work to earn the money herself			1
@entity6 , 29 , lives with her partner @entity7 and six of their ten children in a five - bedroom detached house in @entity13			1
neither she nor 56 - year - old @entity7 work			1
instead , they claim the equivalent of a £ 72k salary before tax - and it 's all down to a skewed benefits system that discourages unemployed claimants from going out to find work			1
@entity7 suffers debilitating headaches that he says prevent him from working			1
but @entity6 is perfectly healthy - and confesses she could work , but chooses not to because she is better off on benefits			1
shameless : @entity6 , 29 , centre , pictured with partner @entity7 , 56 , and their ten children - @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 - says she knows she is taking advantage of the benefits system - but blames the government for making it ' so easy ' in fact , @entity6 currently works a 40 - hour - week in a charity shop for free , because she says she is not a ' stereotypical scrounger ' and she wants her children to have a strong work ethic			1
they do not know she is not paid for her charity shop work , she says			2
but @entity6 , who says she volunteers to ' give something back to society ' , says in an interview with closer magazine that it makes more sense for her to work for free than to get a job that would pay a fraction of her handouts and lose her benefits			1
@entity6 , who used to work in a shop before leaving work after having her second child , has three children of her own , @entity28 , 10 , @entity31 , eight , and @entity61 , six , with her ex-husband , and is stepmother to @entity7 's seven children - @entity26 , 19 , @entity35 , 16 , @entity65 , 14 , @entity30 , 13 , @entity34 , 10 , @entity27 , seven , and @entity33 , three from his relationship with his ex-wife			1
she says that she dreamed of being a teacher before having children put paid to her goal			2
before she split with the father of her three children , she lived in a three - bedroom house , paid for with housing benefit , and claimed income support , child benefit , child tax credits and council tax benefit			1
when she subsequently met @entity7 , who left his job as a factory worker 20 years ago after he began suffering migraines , she took on the role as his permanent carer - enabling her to claim carer 's allowance in addition to @entity7 's £ 60 a week incapacity benefit			1
grace and favour : @entity6 , her partner @entity7 and six of their ten children live in a five - bedroom house in leafy @entity13 paid for with housing benefits it also allows @entity6 to be exempt from the @entity99 rules , meaning she does not lose her benefits when she fails to look for employment			1
to receive carer 's allowance , @entity6 should be caring for @entity103 hours a week , which she admits she does n't need to , given that @entity7 suffers from headaches only once every few weeks			1
between them , the family claim £ 4,524 child benefit , £ 14,456 tax credits , £ 1,200 council tax benefit and £ 8,320 incapacity benefit			2
they also receive £ 20,400 housing benefit a year , which works out at £ 1,700 a month			1
in total , they get £ 48,900 a year			0
they were given a four - bedroom council house in april 2010 , which they swapped in february 2011 for a privately rented five - bedroom house in @entity121 after they complained of damp			2
their new house , in a leafy suburban area , has a large garden , driveway and a garage for their @entity130 people carrier			2
' the benefits are being offered to me , so i 'd be silly to turn them down			1
i know taxpayers are being punished – i hate taking their money			0
but we 're being allowed to get away with it , ' @entity6 says @entity6 , who admits some of the benefits paid to her she does not even need , says in that she and her family are not ' scroungers who watch tv all day			1
' we 're taking advantage of the system , but that 's the system 's fault – we 'd be silly not to with so many mouths to feed , ' she told @entity148			1
' it 's ridiculous , but i 'm better off volunteering than earning – we 're well off and i 'm not going to give that up until i have to			0
' worryingly , @entity6 's situation is far from unusual			2
government statistics show that the annual benefits bill has reached almost £ 13bn			0
@entity6 , who says she is smart with her money , never buying expensive treats and using only secondhand clothes , is candid about the fact they are playing the benefits system to its fullest			1
she says : ' obviously , i could work and i 'd like to			0
i feel guilty about how much we claim – we do n't even need a five - bedroom house as the kids could share			1
but it 's a nice area with good schools			0
' we got the upgrade after we told the council we did n't like our old house – it was damp and one of the kids ' bedrooms was by the front door , which worried me			2
it 's nice having the extra space for when @entity7 's other kids stay			2
' the benefits are being offered to me , so i 'd be silly to turn them down			1
i know taxpayers are being punished – i hate taking their money			0
but we 're being allowed to get away with it , ' she adds			0
' the minimum wage is too low and you lose your benefits if you work , but they 're too easy to get if you do n't work ' the mother , who has nine gsces at grade a to @entity191 , says that she comes from hard - working stock and being jobless goes ' against the grain '			2
' my dad works on the @entity195 and i want my kids to get good jobs			0
i worry people look at us and think , ‘ look at that trampy benefits family			0
' she says she works in the the charity shop from 9am to 5.30pm four days a week because she does n't want to fall into the trap of ' no job , no confidence			0
' i want to meet new people – and teach my kids a work ethic			0
my young children think i get paid for working at the charity shop			0
' @entity6 insists the job gives her a sense of pride - but that if she were to work in a shop for a wage , the money she would be paid ( she estimates £ 13,000 ) would n't cover her rent			1
' i do n't have a choice , ' she told @entity148			0
' i feel like this situation has been forced upon us by the government			0

' the government plans to introduce a @entity229 next year , which aims to introduce an annual cap of £ 26,000 on benefits			0
but @entity6 and @entity7 could be exempt because @entity7 is off work ' on the sick '			1
surprisingly , @entity6 is philosophical about one day losing her benefits , saying that if they were to go , the family would have to make cutbacks			2
they would move to a smaller house , get rid of mobiles and the @entity240 , she says			0
' it 'll be tough – but i understand it has to happen			0
there has to be an overhaul , ' she says			0
' i 'm preparing for the change – i 'm studying for an nvq in retail and customer service , which i do n't have to pay for			0
if i have to get a job , i want a good one			0
but , for now , i just have to make the most of the system while i can			0
' for his part , @entity7 says he would love to get a job , but that if he works for more than an hour , he feels ' ill and stressed '			2
he takes the children to school and helps with the housework , but says that the exertion means he has to rest if he gets light - headed			0
he adds : ' i only get migraines every three weeks , but i qualify for sick pay – and if i did n't take it , i would n't have any money			1

@entity6 , 28 , lives in a five - bed house paid for with housing benefit
partner @entity7 , 56 , is ' on the sick ' and has n't worked in 20 years - despite only suffering headaches once every three weeks
@entity6 admits they take advantage of the system but says she 'd be ' silly ' to turn the handouts down
