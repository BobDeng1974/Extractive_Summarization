killer : @entity1 murdered at least 33 teenage boys during the 1970s since @entity1 was executed for slaying at least 33 teenage boys in sexually - motivated crimes in the 1970s , investigators have long since wondered if the killer took secrets about other murders to his grave			1
now a @entity11 sheriff 's office has discovered an innovative way to solve cold cases - by adding the dna of long - dead serial killers into a national database			1
officers at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , have created dna profiles of @entity1 and other serial killers , and found a legal method of getting the executed killers ' samples entered into databases shared with other law enforcement agencies			1
they can do so because the murderers are technically listed as homicide victims themselves - once they have been put to death by the state			1
the department now hopes to find matches of dna evidence from blood , semen or strands of hair , or skin under the fingernails of victims that link the long - dead killers to the coldest of cold cases			1
and they 're hoping to prompt authorities in other states to submit the dna of their own executed inmates or from decades - old crime scenes			2
' you just know some of these guys did other murders ' , said @entity53 , the detective leading the effort , noting that some of the executed killers ranged all over the country before the convictions that put them behind bars for the last time			2
the @entity20 testing , which began during the summer , is the latest chapter in a story that began when sheriff @entity64 exhumed the remains of unknown victims of @entity1 to create @entity46 profiles			1
blood of a serial killer : three vials of serial murderer @entity1 's blood - recently discovered and analysed by @entity73 's detective @entity53 these could be compared with the dna of people whose loved ones went missing in the 1970s , when @entity1 was killing young men			1
that effort , which led to the identification of one @entity1 victim , caused @entity82 to wonder if the technology could help answer a question that has been out there for decades : did @entity1 kill anyone besides those young men whose bodies were stashed under his house or tossed in a river ? ' he traveled a lot , ' @entity53 said of @entity1			1
' even though we do n't have any information he committed crimes elsewhere , the sheriff asked if you could put it past such an evil person			2
' after unexpectedly finding three vials of @entity1 's blood stored with other @entity1 evidence , @entity53 learned the state would only accept the blood in the crime database if it came from a coroner or medical examiner			1
victims : headshots of some of the boys and young men whose bodies were identified as victims of @entity1 a body is removed from the home of @entity1 in @entity116 on december 27 , 1978 @entity53 thought he was out of luck			1
but then @entity119 coroner @entity118 surprised him with this revelation : in his office freezer were blood samples from @entity1 and at least three other executed inmates			2
the reason they were there is because after the death penalty was reinstated in @entity20 in the 1970s , executions were carried out in @entity119 - all between 1990 and 1999 , a year before then - gov. @entity129 established a moratorium on the death penalty			1
so it was @entity118 's office that conducted the autopsies and collected the blood samples - but there was bigger obstacle to come			0
@entity73 @entity64 , left , and sheriff 's detective @entity53 , pictured with @entity1 's blood , which may help solve ' the coldest of cold ' cases while the state does send to the @entity146 's @entity145 the profiles of homicide victims no matter when they were killed , it will only send the profiles of known felons if they were convicted since a new state law was enacted about a decade ago that allowed them to be included , @entity53 said			1
that meant the profile of @entity1 , who received a lethal injection in 1994 , and the profiles of other executed inmates could not qualify for the database under the felon provision			2
they could , however , qualify as people who died by homicide			0
' they 're homicides because the state intended to take the inmate 's life , ' @entity118 said			0
serial killer @entity170 , pictured in 1979 during the trial which led to his execution last year , authorities in @entity174 created a dna profile from the blood of executed serial killer @entity170 in an attempt to link him to other murders			2
but officials there , where the law allows profiles of convicted felons be uploaded into the database as well as the phase - in of profiles of people arrested on felony charges , do n't know of any law enforcement agency reaching back into history the way @entity19 's sheriff 's office is			0
' we have n't had any initiative where we are going back to executed offenders and asking for their samples , ' said @entity199 , director of @entity201 's laboratory system			0
' i think it 's an innovative approach			0
' @entity118 said he is still looking for blood samples of the rest of the 12 condemned inmates executed between 1977 when @entity20 reinstated the death penalty and 2000 when then - gov. @entity129 established a moratorium			2
so far , @entity46 profiles have been done on the blood of @entity1 and two others ; the profile of the fourth inmate has not yet been done			0
among the other executed inmates whose blood was submitted for testing was @entity217 , a drifter executed in 1998 for his crimes			0
not only did @entity220 's long list of crimes include crimes outside the state - one conviction was for the torture of a woman in @entity227 - but shortly before he was put to death , he claimed to have committed other murders but never provided details			1
so far , no computer hits have linked @entity1 or the others to any other crimes			1
but @entity53 and @entity118 suspect there are investigators who are holding dna evidence that could help solve them			0
that is exactly what happened during the investigation into the 1993 slayings of seven people at a suburban @entity116 restaurant , during which an evidence technician collected a half - eaten chicken dinner even though there was no way to test it for dna at the time			0
when the technology did become available , the dinner was tested and it revealed the identity of one of two men ultimately convicted in the slayings			0
@entity53 says he wants investigators in other states to know that @entity1 's blood is now open for analysis in their unsolved murders			0
he hopes those jurisdictions will , in turn , submit dna profiles of their own executed inmates			0
' that is part of the dna system that 's not being tapped into , ' he said .			0

@entity1 killed at least 33 boys in sexually - motivated crimes in the 1970s
@entity270 finds legal way to get the dna of serial killers into national databases
killers are technically *classed* in @entity11 as ' homicide victims ' as the state put them to death
method already reveals one cold case as victim of @entity1
