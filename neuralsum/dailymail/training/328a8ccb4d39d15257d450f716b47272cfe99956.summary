by @entity0 last updated at 12:55 pm on 29th december 2011 @entity1 says the @entity2 is a ' fascinating ' motorway for many drivers the @entity2 , with its gridlock and never - ending roadworks , is a road to be avoided at all cost			1
but it seems that there are some who would happily pay to experience life in the slowest of lanes			2
@entity14 and @entity15 and coach @entity16 is offering sightseers a tour of the @entity2			1
tourists pay £ 15 for the journey on the 117 mile road as they learn a bit about the history of the motorway that has been dubbed the ' @entity27 's largest car park '			2
and there was such interest in the planned trip that the company has even added a second date - bringing the inaugural tour forward by seven months			2
the bus company , which also runs day trips to tourist attractions such as @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 shopping centre , included the @entity2 tour in its 2012 brochure earlier this month			1
the planned date was 11 october but another date , 22 march , has now been added			0
the trip departs from @entity46 and picks up at @entity47 and @entity14 before heading north on the @entity48 and @entity49 to join the @entity2 at the @entity50			1
the toss of a coin decides which direction the coach will then travel around the motorway			2
according to its website , the tour will also include commentary on ‘ interesting facts about the motorway ’s evolution ’			0
@entity16 spokesman @entity1 said the motorway was ‘ fascinating ’			0
' it goes through six home counties and you get a whole taste of the variety of @entity2 , ’ he said			1
the coach trip has already proved so popular the company had to put on an extra date jams today , probably jams tomorrow : a sightseeing tour of the @entity2 has the potential to last a while 117 miles the length of the @entity2 1hr 40mins how long a lap takes at 70mph 147mph the highest speed recorded by police on the motorway £ 909m how much it cost to build 11 years the time it took to build 12 the number of lanes at its widest 454 the number of accidents in its first year ' in @entity86 you come to @entity87 and coming round by @entity89 you see the planes coming in to land			1
' the first to book on the @entity14 tour was @entity93 , 55 as a retirement gift for his sister @entity95 and her husband @entity96			0
mr @entity93 , told the @entity97 : ‘ they have travelled round places like the @entity100 and @entity101 so i thought it was time they travelled the real world			0
’ mr @entity1 praised the @entity2 's ' iconic ' status , and said : ' as you go around past @entity107 , you get some lovely views from our coach that you just do n't see from a car			1
' he said the trip was already proving so popular that he needed to bring forward the date of the inaugural tour			0
' it 's selling well to our main market , women in their 60s , but we 're also seeing a lot of interest from " geeky " males , ' he said			0
but it seems that the @entity125 firm is not the only one to see the @entity2 ’s potential as a tourist attraction			1
the @entity128 at @entity129 is billed as one of the attractions of the @entity2 bus tour the coach trip will also take sightseers past the impressive sight of @entity89 's @entity136 the @entity87 will provide one non-manmade attraction on the route @entity2 - based firm @entity139 also plans to launch its own tours of the @entity2 to coincide with the @entity141			1
it is making the somewhat bold claim that the @entity2 is @entity2 ’s answer to @entity144			1
its slogan reads : ‘ forget @entity144 , join us on a @entity147 of the world ’s greatest road : the @entity2			2
’ the trip will stop off at points of interest such as @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity89 ’s @entity136 , @entity156 reports			0
@entity139 managing director , @entity157 , told the newspaper : ' we welcome competition from our friends in @entity14 – it 's the @entity141 , after all			0
' but do n't be surprised if some of our coaches are creating traffic problems ahead of their buses , or blockading the @entity49			0
' they wo n't be able to match our standards of comfort , nor our plan for an “ @entity168 ”			0
' this is understood to involve taking a vintage @entity171 bus around the @entity2 on 5 august , the day of the @entity141 women 's marathon			1
’ speaking to the @entity175 , travel writer @entity174 said : ' i think we have got a bit of an arms race developing here			0
' i fear before long we are going to be nose to tail with coach trips on the @entity2			1
' i do not buy @entity1 @entity184 's lyrical description of the beautiful @entity186 countryside seen from the @entity2			2
' but it is a fantastic route to use to get to all kinds of marvellous places			0
' professor @entity190 , president of the @entity191 , said : ' i 'm not sure regular @entity192 will welcome the addition of coach loads of tourists gawping at their misfortune			2
