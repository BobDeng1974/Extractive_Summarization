by @entity0 for the @entity1 nothing seems too pretty in the wider situation around @entity4 these days as discord and intrigue dominate			1
rarely , however , has winning ugly felt quite so satisfying for a club desperate to remind of its power on the pitch			0
a first victory over @entity13 opposition in two years was secured thanks to a deflected drive from youngster @entity16			1
it came late in a tie that was mostly a grim war of attrition , but those aesthetic merits mattered little to @entity20 and his players			0
three times in succession they had come up short in cup competitions when faced by opposition from the top division			2
@entity28 delivered the first of those blows with a 3 - 0 cruise at @entity32 in october 2012 , but last night brought a very different outcome			1
@entity4 players celebrate an ugly 1 - 0 victory over @entity28 in the @entity36 youngster @entity16 scored the game 's only goal late in the second half at @entity32 @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ; @entity45 ( @entity46 73 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity16 ; @entity49 ( @entity50 72 ) , @entity51			1
subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57			0
booked : @entity48 , @entity16			1
@entity28 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ; @entity63 , @entity64 ; @entity65 ( @entity66 73 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity69			1
subs not used : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74			0
booked : @entity68 , @entity64			0
a trip to face @entity79 in the last 16 of the @entity36 is @entity4 ’ reward , yet a psychological barrier may also have been breached			1
in trying to show they can still cut it against the country ’s leading teams — as their wage budget suggests they should — this was a significant breakthrough			0
one look around the stadium would confirm , however , that @entity32 is still a long way away from welcoming back the good old days			0
a crowd of just 15,208 was present , surely a reflection of the distrust that exists between supporters and the board			0
that is a situation only further aggravated by the mysterious case of @entity100 and the @entity102 delegation			0
yet @entity28 could not capitalise on the lack of an intimidating atmosphere			1
in truth , @entity106 ’ side were well short of the form that marked their impressive start to the season and took them to the @entity13 summit			1
the chance of a second successive final in this competition has vanished , with @entity106 left to try to regroup after back - to - back defeats			1
a crowd of around only 15,000 supporters celebrate victory after the final whistle at @entity32 given the pretty much universal opinion that friday night ’s 4 - 0 win over @entity124 in @entity125 had been their most convincing 90 minutes of the season , it was little surprise that @entity20 opted to field an identical starting line - up			1
the desire to prove a point was significant for all at @entity32 but @entity28 also had bountiful motivation after @entity36 glory slipped away following their defeat on penalties to @entity135 at @entity136 in march			1
@entity137 had attempted to influence the psychology of the tie by insisting @entity4 should be viewed as favourites			1
they were also words to try to lessen the expectation on the shoulders of his squad , after an exemplary start to the @entity13 campaign was halted by a 3 - 1 defeat at @entity149			1
suspensions to @entity151 and @entity152 forced alterations regardless of that result and were perhaps reflected in a distinctly fractured opening to the game			0
the piecemeal pattern persisted for the bulk of the first half			0
@entity4 striker @entity49 ( @entity160 ) wins a header during a lacklustre first half @entity4 manager @entity20 ( c ) shakes hands with @entity49 after he was taken off in the second half no one could argue about the level of commitment shown by either side , with relentless harrying of opponents taking place in every corner of the pitch			1
what was absent , however , was any composure in the positive aspects of play			0
the best chance fell to @entity4 and , perhaps predictably , to @entity49			1
with 16 minutes gone , @entity179 gifted the ball to @entity51 and allowed him to feed his strike partner			2
@entity49 ’s first touch took him clear of the @entity28 centre - halves but a toe - poked effort was diverted wide by the left foot of @entity58			1
that emotion continued to loom large , with misplaced passes sent in every conceivable direction			0
some of @entity48 ’s long - range deliveries were a particular source of ire before he became the first booking for a foot up against @entity195			2
@entity68 promptly evened up the crime count by taking down @entity197 after the winger had evaded two team - mates			2
@entity28 ' @entity200 ( c ) takes a tumble as his side battles for possession during a scrappy game @entity4 ' @entity51 ( @entity205 ) fires in a rare shot on goal during the @entity36 encounter @entity4 looked marginally more threatening but could hardly be described as fluent			1
their visitors had toiled to get arch - poacher @entity210 involved , although they did fashion an opportunity when @entity64 skidded a low pass through for @entity67			0
he could , though , only hit a tame shot directly at @entity40 after the back - tracking @entity42 applied sufficient pressure			2
it was more in keeping with events that the half should close with another pair of cautions			0
referee @entity76 first pulled up @entity64 for toppling law before @entity16 earned a yellow card for a rash lunge on @entity67			2
a mistake looked the most likely route towards a breakthrough and one almost arrived 12 minutes after the restart via a player who is no stranger to a lapse			0
@entity42 either thought the referee had stopped play or simply had no idea @entity67 was behind him when he attempted the most casual of turns on the edge of his area			0
the @entity28 winger gladly accepted the gift and advanced to deliver a low cross that saw @entity41 squeeze out @entity210 at the far post			2
the @entity240 international owed a large debt of gratitude to his colleague			0
@entity45 then wasted a promising position for @entity4 when he had possession pinched from him by @entity62			2
@entity16 celebrates giving @entity4 their first win over @entity13 opposition for two years the general quality remained dismal but it took until the 73rd minute for changes to be made by both sides			1
@entity50 and @entity252 replaced @entity49 and @entity45 , while @entity195 made way for @entity254			0
@entity46 promptly smashed a long - range off target before the decisive goal finally arrived after 78 minutes in suitably scrappy fashion			0
@entity4 hollered for a hand - ball as @entity47 tried to nick his way beyond @entity64			1
the ball broke to @entity16 and his low strike took a wicked deflection off @entity61 to beat @entity58			2
@entity28 staged a desperate late push for a leveller , with @entity48 forced to clear a @entity66 header off the line in the final minute			2
there was still time for @entity60 to have another header ruled out for offside before @entity32 had its long - awaited scalp .			0

@entity4 defeated @entity28 1 - 0 in the @entity36
rangers have not beaten @entity13 opposition for two years
@entity16 scored the match winner with a deflected shot
@entity4 will now face @entity79 in the last 16 of the competition
