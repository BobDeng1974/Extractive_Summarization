@entity0 has made it home - 254 days since smashing his head on to rocks in a freak ski accident in the @entity5			1
he returned to his family home at @entity7 on tuesday , according to @entity9 's biggest newspaper @entity8 , way ahead of a schedule set by doctors at a rehabilitation clinic in @entity13 who predicted he might be home by @entity16			1
' he is back home again ! ' the newspaper trumpeted on its website			2
concern : some critics have questioned the wisdom of bringing a man who lay in a coma for almost six months home from the clinic so soon the scene on the slopes at @entity46 when @entity0 was airlifted to hospital after his skiing accident 2013 december 29 – @entity0 , while skiing with his 14 - year - old son @entity32 , fell and hit his head on a rock			1
2014 march 14 - 28 - @entity9 magazine @entity54 published a picture of the star smiling together with his wife @entity30 above the headline ' awake ' , @entity53 , however , were stories of people who had awoken after a coma			0
april 4 – @entity0 's agent reported that he was showing ‘ moments of consciousness ’			1
june 16 – @entity0 left @entity66 for further rehabilitation at the @entity68 of @entity13 , @entity69			1
june 22 – @entity0 ’s medical records – a 10 - page dossier – stolen and offered to media in @entity73 , @entity9 and @entity74 for 60,000 @entity5 francs ( £ 40,000 )			1
july 24 – @entity75 put the family ’s private jet , a $ 20 million ( £ 12m ) grey @entity79 , upfor sale			2
august 5 – a man suspected of stealing the medical records arrested for violating patient privacy and medical secrecy			0
he was not named but was thought to be a manager at @entity5 helicopter company @entity86			0
august 6 – the suspected thief committed suicide in his police cell			0
september 9 – @entity0 left the @entity68 ( @entity90 ) to return to his family home			1
@entity0 was taken in june to the clinic after 189 days in a medically induced coma			1
' he relies on the help of strangers 24 hours around the clock			0
no one dares make a prediction about how long it might take until he has regained motor skills such as language and memory , ' said @entity103 magazine last week , a publication which is noted for having close contacts with the @entity0 family			1
two months ago it reported how work has been going on at his £ 35million mansion at @entity7 , a short drive from the rehabilitation clinic , to build a care facility for him in the grounds that is wheelchair accessible			1
the magazine and a @entity69 newspaper also reported that another building has been constructed for his father @entity117 to move into from his home in @entity9			2
the prognosis is that @entity0 , whose life was catastrophically changed by a low - speed ski accident on december 29 last year , will need years of therapy and , most likely , will always remain a shell of his former self			1
the summer makeover of his home was no mere re-decorating project , but one intended to turn this trophy , glitzy @entity129 - of - the - @entity5 into a singular care facility , one dedicated to giving back as much of life as it can to the monarch who built it			2
' the mansion is being remade to become the sanctuary which , it is hoped , will remake him , ' said a family friend			2
some critics have questioned the wisdom of bringing a man who lay in a coma for almost six months home from the clinic so soon , but professor @entity145 is not one of them			2
' if financial resources allow for someone to create their own home rehabilitation facility complete with gym , and to bring the necessary medical staff and therapists to it , then that is certainly a possibility , ' said the professor who heads the neurosurgical clinic of the world renowned @entity159 in @entity160			2
@entity0 was transferred to the @entity13 , in @entity69 , on june 16 to begin rehabilitation the wherewithal to finance the move was never in question			1
a decade ago the financial bible @entity166 in @entity167 listed him as the second highest - paid athlete in the world while the following year @entity171 magazine identified him as the world 's first dollar billionaire athlete			0
the fortune remains intact and has grown with lucrative advertising and sponsorship deals which sometimes earned him over £ 100million a year on top of his race winnings in the last few seasons of his career			2
@entity0 , 45 , remains hooked up to complex machines that feed him , enable him to breathe for long periods of sleep , remove waste from his body and monitor vital signs			1
he is massaged for hours each day to stimulate muscle mass shed during his long sleep and assessed by the hour to see if his awareness of his environment is rising , waning or static			0
someone who has been a friend of the family for 25 years said : ' @entity30 is happy at the progress he has made so far and optimistic that much more can be achieved			0
she is counting the successes one by one and ignoring the likelihood that he will make anything other than a full recovery			0
' he did n't die in the accident and he did n't die during the two emergency operations that followed it			0
he came out of the coma and he has had periods of awakening where he is able to make the smallest of nods			0
he was deemed well enough to be released from the hospital and may be fit enough to sit in a wheelchair by autumn 's end			0
all of this is positive and @entity30 takes each small dose of good news as it comes			0
@entity75 , wife of the former racing driver , and @entity74 professor @entity214 arriving at the @entity216 hospital in @entity66 , @entity74 , where @entity0 was first sent ' the question remains , however , about how much improvement can be expected the coming months and years			1
will he speak again ? will he walk again ? will he be able to feed and dress himself ? the doctors do n't know			1
no - one can know			0
the probability is that he will never be the man he was before the accident , that much is starkly clear			0
' as of now , @entity0 lies in a state of what is termed ' minimal consciousness ' in which he can briefly move eyes toward persons or objects , experiences sleeping and waking cycles and has been known to react to loud sounds with a startled look			1
but he is unable to follow instructions , has no speech or other forms of communication and no purposeful movement of his limbs			0
according to the source a thin buzzcut of down has regrown over the savage dragon 's - teeth scars crisscrossing @entity0 's skull , the evidence of the lifesaving operations performed on him at @entity66 where , initially , he was not expected to last the night after the accident at @entity46			1
he is moved every two hours to prevent pressure sores by carers who are required to hand in their mobile telephones before they report for duty in case the temptation to take a photograph of him proves too much			0
and a tent has been constructed at the back of his ward to prevent long - lens paparazzi shots of him when he is moved outside , as he is from time to time			0
@entity0 's father , @entity260 ( left ) and brother @entity261 , arrive at @entity66 , @entity74 , on january 5 , to visit the poorly former racing driver @entity0 poses with his wife , @entity30 , at the winter resort of @entity265 , in @entity268 's @entity267 range on 11 january 2005			2
