by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 04:44 est , 13 april 2013 @entity1 , 51 , was astonished to see that the ' stone ' he had dug up with his @entity3 was in fact his missing tortoise , @entity6 a tortoise that went missing ten months ago has been found alive - after his owner dug up his garden to build a house extension			1
@entity1 had assumed his pet would never be seen again after he went missing from his @entity13 home last june			1
but when mr @entity1 began digging up his garden to add an extension to his house , they found a tortoise - shaped , mud - covered lump in the soil			1
mr @entity1 , 51 , said : ' we started digging up the land for the foundations of our extension and i was spraying some pesticide on it when i ended up spraying @entity6			1
' at first i thought he was a stone - he was absolutely caked in mud			0
' @entity6 , who is five and had been a present to mr @entity30 from his 46 - year - old wife in 2011 , was last seen in june before he disappeared overnight			1
mr @entity1 , a blacksmith , and his partner @entity33 , 46 , spent a fortnight looking for their the @entity36 tortoise , even calling in a gun dog to see if it could sniff the tortoise out			2
but when they still could not find @entity6 , which miss @entity33 had given her boyfriend as a present in 2011 , they assumed he had wandered off for ever			2
mr @entity1 said : ' he 's normally kept in about a 25 or 26 degree controlled environment , in a heated vivarium , and we never let him hibernate			0
' so when he got out last june there is every chance he mistook the cool summer for winter and burrowed his way underground			2
' that would explain why we could n't find him			0
' @entity6 the tortoise was barely recognisable when he was dug up by a @entity3 ten months after going missing mr @entity1 shows the mound of earth and rubble his tortoise was extracted from in his @entity60 garden happy to be free : @entity6 looked as good as new after a wash and a check - up from the vet three weeks ago they began digging up their garden so they could lay the foundations for the four - bedroom extension to their home in @entity60			1
they dug five feet down with a @entity3 , and it was in this earth that @entity6 was found			2
when mr @entity1 realised the mud - covered object was his pet , he initially assumed he must have died			0
mr @entity1 believes his pet might have struggled to dig himself free without the @entity3 digging him out			1
he said : ' i 'm amazed how long he has managed to survive for			0
and i ca n't believe he survived being dug up by the digger			0
after 10 months burrowed deep in the chilly @entity13 soil , @entity6 is back in his heated vivarium ' it 's a miracle , i suppose			1
@entity33 is over the moon but she is working in @entity83 so still has n't seen him			0
she is absolutely delighted now			0
' mr @entity1 has now washed @entity6 and returned him to his heated vivarium after his extended winter			1
he has been checked over by a vet and given the all - clear			0
tortoises are known to bury themselves just under the surface of the earth as part of their hibernation pattern .			0

@entity6 the tortoise went missing from his @entity13 home in june
his owner @entity1 , 51 , found him this month when digging up garden
he believes @entity6 burrowed into ground during cold summer last year
