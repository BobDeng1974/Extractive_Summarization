freshwater crocodiles with an appetite for the toxic cane toads have worked out a clever way to get a delicious meal without being poisoned			1
the crocodile population in @entity6 has dropped dramatically in the past few years but the ‘ dwarf ’ crocs have been munching away at the hind legs of the pests to survive			2
crocodile specialist dr @entity10 told @entity11 that they discovered a significant amount of toxic cane toads with missing legs after observing the areas around @entity17 and @entity18 rivers in @entity19 , around 500 kilometres from @entity20			1
poisonous cane toads found without their hind legs - believed to have been eaten by a freshwater ' dwarf ' croc ‘ my wife @entity27 did some surveys in 2009 after the cane toads reached the areas			1
she observed the twisted and mangled toads and noticed the crocodile teeth marks , ’ he told @entity11			2
‘ we know that they often like to flick and tear off whatever they ’re holding in their mouth and that ’s what we ’re seeing a lot around the area			0
‘ we were sceptical at first but now we ’ve seen patterns and it ’s obvious that they ’re mangling the back legs to feed themselves			0
’ ' the freshwater ' dwarf ' crocs have found a clever way to survive - by munching off the hind legs of toads dr @entity10 and his wife @entity27 discovered a significant amount of missing legs on toxic cane toads dwarf crocs can grow to one - and - a - half metre in size and are classified in the same freshwater croc species while the inevitable arrival of poisonous cane toads could have affected the small population of freshwater crocs , mr @entity10 said the toads may have found a safe way to consume the toxic pests			1
‘ the toads have toxins in parts of their body that will usually kill the crocodiles when they consume them , ’ mr @entity10 said			2
' we 're afraid that the toads could wipe them out - it 's a serious effect on the crocs ' population and there were n't many of them to start with			0
' the ones who have been tearing of their legs from its limbs are the ones who have survived			0
‘ or the previous ones who have consumed toads before were put off after eating a whole toad			0
‘ so they simply learn during the trial and error and found that this is the way to eat delicious toads in a natural progression and they know its safe			0
’ dr @entity10 and his wife @entity27 observed areas around the @entity17 and @entity18 rivers in @entity19 poisonous cane toads found without their hind legs - believed to have been eaten by a freshwater ' dwarf ' croc dwarf crocs can grow to one - and - a - half metre in size but dr @entity10 added that they are still categorised in the same species as freshwater crocodiles			1
‘ we call them dwarfs or pygmies because they ’re half the size smaller than a normal freshwater croc , ’ he told @entity11			1
‘ the reason why they ’re so small is because there is less food for them to eat but they ’re incredible survivors – if they do n’t get enough food or they eat really slow – they just wo n’t grow as much			0
