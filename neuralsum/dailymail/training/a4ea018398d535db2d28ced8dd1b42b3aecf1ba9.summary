@entity1 manager @entity0 has ordered his side to ' get back to basics ' after their careless exit from the @entity5			1
the @entity6 were 2 - 1 up at the @entity7 until @entity8 scored twice in the last three minutes to progress with a 3 - 2 win			1
in their last two @entity10 matches @entity1 threw away leads against @entity12 and @entity13 to draw both games 2 - 2 and it is becoming a concern for a side who prided themselves on defensive rigidity last season			1
@entity21 ( right ) knocked @entity1 out with an 88th minute winner at the @entity7 one positive for @entity1 was that @entity23 ( left ) was on the pitch for a full 90 minutes the arrival of @entity26 at the @entity27 on saturday is hardly the easiest opportunity to prove that the message is sinking in , with @entity31 's side having ran in seven unanswered goals against @entity34 in midweek , but @entity0 has laid down the challenge			1
' it 's a concern , of course it is , and it 's hugely disappointing , ' said @entity0			2
' the things we 've managed to do in the last couple of years , to get out of the @entity41 , stay up and get to the @entity43 final , have all been based around the ability to hang on to a lead , the ability to see it through			0
' i ca n't remember in 16 years of management , or the 30 - odd years i 've been in football , where we 've conceded such goals in the last couple of minutes to cost us			2
@entity52 scored a minute before @entity21 to level the scores in the 87th minute on wednesday @entity8 's two goals in three minutes meant that they have thrown away three leads in their last three mcauley wheels away in celebration after his equaliser for @entity8 ' but it 's our turn			1
at @entity8 it 's cost us our place in the cup			2
' so we 'll have to get back to basics , if that 's what it is , the basics			0
' we 'll certainly have to defend properly on saturday against a really outstanding team			0
' one positive from @entity1 's cup exit was the chance to see @entity23 on the pitch for a full 90 minutes			1
the @entity75 was an outcast at @entity12 before sealing a loan move on transfer deadline day and @entity0 has been cautious about over-exposing the playmaker			2
a much - changed xi for the cup provided the chance to test his legs but @entity0 believes more time is needed before he can be considered a regular starter			0
' there 's no question he can pick a pass , he 's got fantastic ability , but we also have to bear in mind he has n't really played since last february , which is a hell of a long time , ' he explained			0
' he might have a part to play on saturday but there 's a lot to do with his levels of fitness and he 's still got a lot to do before we let him loose on the @entity10			1
' it would be wrong of me to ask him to play two ( full ) games in four days when he has n't played one in seven months			0
' we have to box clever with him			0
everybody knows what ability the kid 's got and he 'll be a big asset i 'm sure , but we have to get him to the right fitness levels			0
' @entity0 ( left ) says his @entity1 side must go back to basics to improve their defending			1

@entity1 were 2 - 1 up against @entity8 in the @entity5 , but lost 3 - 2 after two goals in the last three minutes
@entity0 's side have thrown away leads against @entity12 and @entity13 to draw 2 - 2 in their last two @entity10 matches
@entity1 play @entity26 at the @entity27 on saturday
@entity0 says that his side must go back to basics and *concentrate* on defending if they are to progress this season
