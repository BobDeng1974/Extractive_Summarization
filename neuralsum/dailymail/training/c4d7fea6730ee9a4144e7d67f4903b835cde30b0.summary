by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 24 november 2012 updated : 06:54 est , 26 november 2012 little boy @entity1 is one of 20 children whose hopes of finding a cure to a rare disease have been dashed after a hoax ‘ donor ’ pledged £ 1million to charity before disappearing			1
the hoaxer led the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) to believe that he would make the donation enabling the charity to conduct a drugs trial			1
two - year - old @entity1 was being considered for the scheme and it was only when @entity10 stopped receiving correspondence from the ‘ donor ’ that the @entity18 - based charity realised they had been duped			1
distraught : @entity20 had hoped her son @entity1 would be selected for the drugs trial there are 150 in the @entity24 who suffer from the deadly @entity27 condition , which causes severe mental and physical deterioration			1
@entity1 ’s mother @entity20 , 29 , has branded the stunt as ' sick ' but remains determined to continue fundraising for her son			2
the mother , who also has an older son @entity32 , 9 , said : ‘ we were so happy			0
‘ they said he wanted to remain anonymous so i just assumed it was a celebrity			0
’ families of children with the rare condition had raised £ 100,000 towards funding the £ 600,000 treatment which would prolong their lives			2
they believed they had struck gold when , following television coverage , one of the mothers received an email and a @entity48 friend request from an anonymous potential donor , claiming to be a ‘ self - made man ’			2
he offered to put up the remaining £ 500,000 needed to fund the trial , saying : ‘ i ’ve got my own kids and it ’s what i would want for them			2
’ duped charity : the @entity9 ( pictured ) only realised they had been tricked by the ' self - made man ' when they stopped receiving correspondence from him the other 18 families were also told about the offer			1
in a series of communications , the ' donor ' increased his offer to £ 1million , claiming he was ' so moved by the cause ' that he wanted to support more children suffering with these devastating diseases			1
he told @entity10 that lawyers had been appointed and his bank had been instructed to arrange the donation			0
then , after claiming a mix - up had led to a delay in payment , correspondence suddenly stopped			0
another mother @entity76 , from @entity77 , @entity78 , said : ‘ i would never have thought someone would be cruel enough to do something like this			0
‘ this makes us more determined to raise the full amount			0
’ there is no treatment available for the disease and those afflicted by the condition are not expected to live beyond their teens			0
determined to raise the money : ms @entity20 , along with other parents , have pledged to raise the money needed for the drugs trial despite the cruel hoax a @entity98 drug treatment is offering some hope for families as it has been shown to halt the progression of the disease in preclinical studies but needs to be clinically trialled before it can be prescribed in the @entity24			1
a spokeswoman for @entity106 , the fundraising branch of @entity10 , said : ‘ funding for clinical studies in children with ultra-rare diseases appears to be of little interest to major research funding bodies , and so wicked genes have taken it in to their own hands to raise the £ 600,000 needed			0
‘ the hoaxer maintained his cruel charade for over two weeks , regularly making contact with the charity and promising the money so the clinical trial could start immediately to save these children ’s lives			1
‘ whilst the @entity127 was cautious , it also found it difficult to believe a hoaxer could act so immorally and chose such a vulnerable group of children and their families as his victims			0
‘ hopes raised of the clinical trial starting before @entity137 have been heartbreakingly dashed			0
’ the hoax was reported to @entity139 but they said no crime had been committed and they could not take further action			2
if you would like to donate for the @entity98 clinical trial , text @entity146 £ 2 / £ 5 / £ 10 to 70070 to help these families reach their target or contact the charity through their website at @entity151			1

@entity1 , 2 , has a deadly @entity27 condition which has no cure
he was one of 20 children hoping to be selected for a drug trial after ' donor ' pledged £ 1million
the charity conducting the trial realised they had been duped when correspondence with the man stopped
parents have *vowed* to continue raising money to conduct the trial
police say they can not take action as no crime has been committed
