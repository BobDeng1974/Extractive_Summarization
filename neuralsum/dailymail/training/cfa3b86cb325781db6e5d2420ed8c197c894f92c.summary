by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 29 march 2013 a life - like , autonomous robotic jellyfish the size and weight of a grown man is the latest weapon in the @entity7 ’s arsenal to guard the world ’s oceans			1
@entity11 researchers have unveiled the prototype robot , nicknamed @entity13			1
it is a larger model of a robotic jellyfish the same team made in 2012 – headed by @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity19 , and professor of mechanical engineering at @entity22 the earlier robot , dubbed @entity24 , is roughly the size of a man 's hand , and typical of jellyfish found along beaches			1
‘ @entity44 and engineering results show that larger vehicles have a lower cost of transport , which is a metric used to determine how much energy is spent for traveling			1
’ both robots are part of a multi-university , nationwide $ 5 million ( £ 3.3m ) project funded by @entity55 and the @entity56			0
jellyfish are attractive candidates to mimic because of their ability to consume little energy owing to a lower metabolic rate than other marine species			1
additionally , they appear in wide variety of sizes , shapes and colours , allowing for several designs			0
they also inhabit every major oceanic area of the world and are capable of withstanding a wide range of temperatures in both fresh and salt waters			0
preparing the prototyope : researchers have been testing the device in a swimming pool , preparing it for a life in the ocean most species are found in shallow coastal waters , but some have been found in depths 7,000 metres below sea level			2
partner universities in the project are @entity88 in @entity89 , the @entity90 , the @entity91 at @entity92 , and @entity93			0
@entity17 's team is building the jellyfish body models , integrating fluid mechanics and developing control systems			2
@entity13 is modelled and named after the jellyfish @entity98 , @entity99 for @entity102 's @entity101 jellyfish			1
jellyfish , with ‘ @entity13 ’ derived from ‘ cyanea ’ and ‘ robot			1
’ as with its predecessor , this robot is in the prototype stage , years away from use in waters			2
a new prototype model already is under construction at @entity11 's @entity113 , where @entity114 is based			2
‘ our hopes for @entity13 's future is that it will help understand how the propulsion mechanism of such animal scales with size			1
’ a big difference exists between the larger and smaller robots			0
@entity13 is powered by a rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery , whereas the smaller models were tethered , @entity17 said			1
experiments have also been conducted on powering jellyfish with hydrogen but there is still much research to be done in that area			2
fully charged : the @entity132 is covered in a sleek silicone skin and is powered up with a battery that could last up to several months in both cases , the jellyfish must operate on their own for months or longer at a time as engineers likely wo n't be able to capture and repair the robots , or replace power sources			1
‘ @entity13 showed its ability to swim autonomously while maintaining a similar physical appearance and kinematics as the natural species , ’ @entity17 said , adding that the robot is simultaneously able to collect , store , analyse , and communicate sensory data			1
this autonomous operation in shallow water conditions is already a big step towards demonstrating the use of these creatures			0
the jellyfish body consists of a rigid support structure with direct current electric motors which control the mechanical arms that are used in conjunction with an artificial mesoglea , or jelly - based pulp of the fish 's body , creating hydrodynamic movement			1
with no central nervous system , jellyfish instead use a diffused nerve net to control movement and can complete complex functions			2
a parallel study on a bio-inspired control system is in progress which will eventually replace the current simplified controller			0
as with the smaller models , @entity13 's skin is comprised of a thick layer of silicone , squishy in one 's hand			1
it mimics the sleek jellyfish skin and is placed over a bowl - shaped device containing the electronic guts of the robot			1
when moving , the skin floats and moves with the robot , looking weirdly alive			2
‘ it has been a great experience to finally realize the biomimetic and bio-inspired robotic vehicles , ’ @entity17 said			0
‘ nature has too many secrets and we were able to find some of them but many still remain			0
we hope to find a mechanism to continue on this journey and resolve the remaining puzzles			0
’ the goal of the robot jellyfish is to place self - powering , autonomous machines in waters for the purposes of surveillance and monitoring the environment			1
in addition , its other uses will be studying aquatic life , mapping ocean floors , and monitoring ocean currents			0
the jellyfish must operate on their own for months or longer at a time as engineers likely wo n't be able to capture and repair the robots , or replace power sources			0
future uses of the robot jellyfish could include conducting military surveillance , cleaning oil spills , and monitoring the environment			2
the idea for a robotic jellyfish was pioneered by the @entity219 @entity55 and the @entity56			1
jellyfish appear in wide variety of sizes , shapes and colours , allowing for several designs			0
they also inhabit every major oceanic area of the world and are capable of withstanding a wide range of temperatures in both fresh and salt waters			0
most species are found in shallow coastal waters , but some have been found in depths 7,000 meters below sea level			0
jellyfish have drifted along on ocean currents for millions of years , even before dinosaurs lived on the @entity240			0
they have tiny stinging cells in their tentacles to stun or paralyze their prey before they eat them .			0
