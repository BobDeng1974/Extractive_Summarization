by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 5 july 2013 a council is to spend £ 500,000 on upgrading its pavements to try and tackle the obesity crisis			1
@entity5 council says there is some evidence that better pavements encourage people to use them more			1
but residents in the county are baffled by the council 's priorities , questioning why so much money is being spent on improving adequate pavements , and how the council thinks better walkways will help tackle the growing problem of obesity			1
big problem : the @entity20 has the worst levels of obesity in the country			0
@entity24 hopes improving its pavements will help tackle the problem @entity27 , 68 , of @entity28 , said : ' we hear that money is tight , so why is the council spending money on pavements that are all right ? ' she added : ' how will that help obese people get fit anyway ? ' her skepticism was also shared by @entity35 , who runs the @entity28 branch of @entity37			1
' improving the pavements is n’t the first thing that i would think of when it came to ways to beat obesity , ' she said			0
councils across the country were awarded grants earmarked for improving roads and pavements as part of a government scheme			0
extreme weather in recent years has left many roads and walkways needing repairs , left with cracks and potholes			0
the council has selected areas with the highest incidence of obesity , including @entity28 , pictured , for pavement improvements obese : the @entity20 is officially the fattest region in @entity62 according to recent research in @entity5 's case , the council was given £ 1.5million to improve roads and £ 500,000 for its walkways			1
a council spokesman told the @entity71 that this amount was just a ' drop in the ocean ' compared to what was needed to improve the entirety of the council 's pavements			1
therefore , councillors decided to prioritise improvements where levels of obesity were highest , in a bid to encourage people to walk more , as opposed to drive			1
the spokesman said : ' there 's evidence to suggest that where that has been implemented before it has been associated with a better use of pavements			2
' he said that when pavements near schools have been improved , there was ' anecdotal evidence ' to suggest that more parents were walking their children to school			2
earmarked : the government cash was earmarked for road and pavement improvements			1
@entity101 will be getting a makeover since there is a high rate of obesity among its residents			2
right , a pavements in @entity28 he said that the ' bottom line ' was that the council ' hoped it would encourage healthy lifestyles '			2
people in the @entity20 are officially the fattest in @entity62 , with more hospital admissions for obesity - related illnesses than anywhere else in the country			2
the council 's public health department drew up a list of areas in @entity5 where levels of obesity were highest			1
the @entity5 district of @entity124 had the most obesity - linked hospital admissions with 2,878 per 100,000 people last year			0
however , this district is not on the list for improvements			0
councillors selected five areas with the highest incidence of obesity , coupled with the highest need of walkways repairs , and decided to improve the pavements in these areas			1
they are : @entity101 , @entity139 , @entity28 , @entity140 , @entity141			0
@entity142 , the county council ’s service director for highways , said : ' it ’s all about encouraging people to lead healthier lifestyles and is part of a wider package			0
' opposition spokesman for highways and transport @entity152 said : ' i support the investment in pavements , but do n’t think it will have the desired outcome of tackling obesity			0
' work will now begin to identify footpaths to local schools and shops that need revamping to encourage people to walk more using obesity prevalence data and footway condition surveys .			0

@entity24 selected ' fattest ' areas for pavement improvements
says there is evidence to suggest good walkways will encourage more use
