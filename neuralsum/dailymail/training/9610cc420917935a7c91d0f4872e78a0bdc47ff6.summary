@entity0 has jumped to the defence of his fiancée @entity2 after she appeared to launch a furious tirade at his opponent during his @entity6 semi-final victory			1
in one of several heated moments during the clash , the usually poised 27 - year - old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards @entity14 player @entity13			1
as tensions boiled over , the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth ' f * * * * * g have that , you @entity14 flash f * * * ' , or ' @entity22 , you flash f * * k ’			1
but speaking after the game , @entity0 said the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to ' a lot of tension ' whipped up before the match			2
he told reporters : ' when there 's a lot of tension surrounding something which you ( the media ) created , which you created , then it 's completely normal			1
' the whole first set , everyone was tight			0
my physical trainer , physio , i 'm sure for @entity69 it was uncomfortable			0
' even @entity13 , who very rarely says anything on the court , there was tension there for him , as well			2
yeah , in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret			0
and , yeah , that 's it			0
' the dramatic outburst came as @entity0 won a tense baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back against world number 7			1
luckily , there were no microphones nearby to pick up her exact choice of colourful words - but it was evident ms @entity2 was deeply invested in the match			1
the highly - charged match was the first time @entity0 and @entity13 had come head - to - head since the latter hired @entity0 's former trainer @entity97			1
ms @entity2 was caught on camera using colourful language as @entity0 secured a break in the third set to put himself firmly in control of the match with @entity14 @entity13			1
he won the game in four sets the pair met for the tenth time in today 's march			2
@entity13 is now coached by @entity0 's former coach @entity97 , which made for an extra tense occasion mr @entity97 helped @entity0 win his two grand slam titles and an @entity112 gold before they stopped working together in november			1
the dynamic dominated the pre-match build - up , despite both players trying to quietly play down tensions between the two camps			0
but there was no doubt that it added a fiery edge to the match , with @entity0 admitting afterwards that there had been acrimonious mood around @entity124			1
@entity0 eventually beat the @entity14 in four sets , earning himself a spot in the coveted final this weekend			1
speaking on court , he said : ' a lot was made of @entity69 working with him			0
we 've been friends since we were 15 and i felt like that was a bit unfair and unnecessary			0
' this is sport , there is more to life and i thought it was unfair and created a bit of extra tension			0
@entity13 had won six of the 10 matches between him and @entity0 ( pictured during today 's game ) and beat @entity141 for the first time in nine years in the last eight - but @entity0 kept up his impeccable form @entity0 , pictured during today 's game , will now compete in the final at @entity124 for the fourth time it was the first time @entity0 had played @entity13 ( pictured ) since he hired @entity0 's former coach , which no doubt added a fiery edge to the match ' it was there definitely at the beginning but i think everyone calmed down after the start of the match			1
' but the @entity158 also used his victory to heap praise on his coach , @entity161			1
he said : ' a lot of people criticised me for working with her and i think so far this week we have showed women can be very good coaches as well			1
' @entity167 , who reached the semi-finals here , is also coached by a woman in @entity171 and i see no reason why that ca n't keep moving forward so i am very thankful to @entity161 for doing it			2
' i would say it was a brave choice from her and hopefully i can repay her in a few days			0
' meanwhile , on the sidelines , ms @entity2 was facing a tennis @entity39 - off against @entity13 's tanned model partner @entity41 for the second day running			1
much has been made of the rivalry between the two women , both of whom have recently got engaged to their tennis pros			0

' back on court , after coming out on top in a long exchange in the first set , @entity0 turned in the direction of @entity97 , who sitting in his opponent 's box , and let out a wild roar in celebration			2
