speaking to @entity43 , he said : ' it 's up there ( with my best )			0
i like the @entity48 goal ( better )			0

seen my second goal back and definitely my best			0
happy for my bro @ poldi_official getting 2 goals and congratulations to the boys making their debuts too			0
' meanwhile , manager @entity61 revealed he was unimpressed when he saw the midfielder taking aim , but was impressed with the end result			0
' when he took the shot i thought that 's maybe not the best of ideas , ' he told @entity43			0
' but the way it went in was absolutely unbelievable			0
' @entity1 's shot reached 53.4mph on its way to the back of the net , and took just over one second to reach its destination			1
