a @entity1 tv producer pulled off an epic @entity3 take - down of an apparently horrid fellow passenger on his flight to @entity6 yesterday that ended with the middle - aged woman slapping him in the face			1
@entity10 , whose @entity3 bio says he 's a producer on @entity13 's @entity12 , began tweeting from the airport around 11 a.m. on @entity15 , after learning his flight was running behind schedule			1
what came next was a blow by blow account , from 30,000 feet , of his note - passing battle with ' @entity21 from @entity22 ' that would put most 7th graders to shame			1
@entity3 war : @entity10 , pictured , whose @entity3 bio says he 's a producer on @entity13 's @entity12 , began tweeting from the airport about midday on @entity15 ' our flight is delayed			1
a woman on here is very upset because she has @entity15 plans			1
she is the only one obviously			2
praying for her , ' the long - haired , bearded @entity10 began			1
he added : ' she 's telling the flight attendants that it is @entity15			1
she wants them to know she wants to have dinner with her family			2
' according to @entity10 , the woman was getting pretty irate at the prospect of being late for her holiday dinner			1
' the male flight attendant said " i understand ma'am			1
i 'm looking forward to seeing my family too			2
" she responded " this is n't about you , " ' @entity10 tweeted			1
' her family is very important to her , she says			0
her family has a special recipe for stuffing			0
she needs to be there to help			0
it is crucial , ' he wrote in a follow up			0
first encounter : @entity10 's first tweet , pictured , on the subject revealed his flight was delayed that one passenger was particularly pissed off annoying : the woman continued to complain , according to @entity10 up in the air : once seated , he bought he a glass of wine and wrote the woman , later revealed to be called @entity21 , a note , pictured @entity10 said the woman could n't believe that she might be late , and she wanted everyone to know about it			1
' she has a connecting flight			1
why does n't anyone understand she has a connecting flight ? why do people not understand her needs ? ' he tweeted			2
finally , the plane took off , but the hilarious tit - for - tat was just getting started			2
' she had to sit down because we took off			0
she has been muttering " about damn time " and i can hear her breathing from 5 rows back , ' he tweeted , from up in the air			0
that 's when he decided to send her a glass of red wine			2
he took a picture of both for the pleasure of his 35,000 twitter followers who , if they were already sick to death of their own @entity93 , would have been following the action closely			0
upset : though @entity10 , pictured , may have been the most confrontational , others on board were also aware of the impolite woman 's behavior , he said enjoying the action : after the wine , @entity10 gave the woman two small bottles of vodka that the assistant handed him , after which he was a little nervous the note read : ' @entity106 in @entity107 , it has come to my attention that today is your ' @entity15 ! ' it must be hard to not be with your family			1
please accept this glass of wine			0
it is a gift from me to you			0
' hopefully if you drink it , you wo n't be able to use your mouth to talk			0
' though he may have been the most confrontational , others on board were also aware of the impolite woman 's behavior , he said			2
' the male flight attendant is giving me the " let 's just pretend this never happened " face			1
shaking his head a lot , ' he tweeted , before adding that the host took him aside			0
' he gave me two little bottles of vodka but he wo n't hand them to her			0
he says i have to do it myself			0
' he told the @entity135 ' i 'm going to do it			2
' then four minutes later , he wrote : ' @entity136 i did it i walked as if i was going to the bathroom and i leaned over and put them on her tray table and walked away @entity142			0
' he said , in response , the woman just stared at him ' really hard , ' and was breathing through her teeth			0
but he was clearly enjoying the altercation			0
retaliation : but the woman , @entity21 , struck back wit her own note , pictured @entity149 : ' this means war , ' he tweeted , before sending out a description of his opponent to his tens of thousands of followers ' i 'm not going to lie i am shaking this is so terrifying she is so angry at me it 's kind of incredible , ' he tweeted			1
' i do n't really know what to do now i 'm afraid to get out of my seat			0
this is like being on a roller coaster i 'm scared and super excited			0
' but that 's when the woman struck back			2
' the male flight attendant just handed me a note from @entity22 , ' he tweeted before posting a picture of the letter from ' @entity21			1
' ' dear ' @entity119 , ' the wine was n't funny			0
the vodka was n't funny			0
you 're an awful person with no compassion			0
i 'm sorry for your family that they should have to deal with you			0
' ' this means war , ' he tweeted , before sending out a description of his opponent to his tens of thousands of followers			0
another note : @entity10 hit back with another note in which he told ' @entity21 ' to stay home next time she was in a bad mood seat : he also took a photo of the woman 's seat , pictured ' @entity21 is in her late 40s or early 50s			1
she is wearing mom jeans and a studded belt and she is wearing a medical mask over her idiot face , ' he tweeted			0
in an amusing effort , he even tweeted at @entity197 in a bid to get her kicked off the flight 30,000 feet in the air			1
' @ @entity203 hi i find a passenger on one of your planes to be annoying			2
if i give you money will you remove her ? i want to buy her seat , ' he wrote			0
but decided another note , which he said he was considering ' balling up in my mouth and spitting it into her tray table , ' was his best retaliation approach			2
he tweeted a picture of her seat number and then his response note before delivering it			2
it read : ' dear ' @entity21 , ' thank you for your lovely note			1
the person who lacks compassion is you			0
we all want to get home , particularly the nice men and women who fly your lazy ass around and serve you drinks ( you 're welcome ! ) next time you 're in a bad mood , stay home			0
i hate you very much			0
eat my d * * * ' love ' elan			1
' tit - for - tat : @entity21 's next note , pictured , read : ' " @entity119 " this is inappropriate beyond belief			1
i will be speaking to the authorities when we land ' rude : but the producer could n't leave it there , and sent another note to @entity21 , referring again to his genitalia violent : in a violent twist of fate , it was @entity21 who may have been in trouble with the authorities when they landed @entity21 shot back with her own threat			1
' " @entity119 " this is inappropriate beyond belief			0
i will be speaking to the authorities when we land			0
' but the producer could n't leave it there			2
with the comment , ' my final ( i think ) note to @entity21 in @entity22 , ' he posted a picture of his latest offering , ' dear " @entity21 " when you speak to the authorities , please make sure they arrest you for cannibalism because you just ate my d * * * ! ' @entity119			1
' however , in a violent twist of fate , it was @entity21 who may have been in trouble with the authorities when they landed			1
' well , " @entity21 just slapped me , ' @entity10 tweeted			1
final note : in a last note , after the slapping , @entity10 gave @entity21 his @entity3 handle and told her to read all his tweets signing off : signing off , @entity10 added once more for measure ' eat my d * * * ' he later explained , on his connecting flight to @entity288 , how it all played out			1
' when i got off the plane i waited for her at the gate			0
i was holding another note in my hand and i was going to give it to her , ' he tweeted			2
' she walked right up to me and slapped me immediately in the face			2
' he said the gate agent for the next flight actually grabbed her and held her back before asking @entity10 if he wanted the airport police called			1
he said ' no , ' as @entity21 turned to ask the same agent whether she 'd make her connecting to @entity305			1
' he said " no , " ' @entity10 tweeted			1
he said he laughed and the agent asked again if he wanted to call the police			0
again he said no , but he did have one last note for her			2
it read : ' @entity21 , allow me to introduce myself			1
and maybe next time you 'll be nice to people who are just trying to help			0
' and signing off he wrote , ' @entity318 my d * * *			1
' hat - tip to @entity321 for first reporting this hilarious @entity15 etiquette lesson .			1

@entity10 , whose @entity3 bio says he 's a producer on @entity13 's @entity12 , began tweeting about 11 a.m. on @entity15
he said his flight was delayed and described an apparently horrid fellow passenger who was outraged she 'd miss ' her @entity15 '
what came next was a blow by blow account , from 30,000 feet , of @entity10 's note - passing battle with ' @entity21 from @entity22 '
it ended in him getting slapped and her being told ' eat my d * * * '
