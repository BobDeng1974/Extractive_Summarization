@entity0 fears @entity1 will eventually be forced to play a game behind closed doors if delinquent fans continue to put them in the @entity7 dock			1
@entity7 ’s governing body have opened another disciplinary case against the @entity11 champions following crowd disorder during the @entity14 match against @entity15 last week			1
visiting fans set off a firework and reportedly clashed with riot police during the 4 - 3 loss in @entity20			1
@entity7 have confirmed their disciplinary panel will judge the case on february 19 - the same day @entity1 host @entity24 in the first leg of their @entity14 knockout tie			1
@entity1 supporters wave flags and spark flares ahead of the match at the @entity31 in @entity32 @entity1 fans set off a firework and reportedly clashed with riot police during the 4 - 3 loss in @entity20 @entity1 manager @entity0 has warned the delinquent @entity1 fans that their behaviour is harming the club it is the fifth time in three years @entity1 have faced charges as a result of supporters ’ behaviour during @entity46 matches			1
@entity0 feels if such behavour is n’t brought to an abrupt halt , the club will be forced to play in an empty stadium			0
‘ it is very sad if this is the consequence because 99 per cent are very good supporters with a very good reputation - and that one per cent we have to stop , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ because if that ( a closed stadium ) could be the end product , that is not good for the club or @entity11 football			0
if you continue making the same mistakes you will get consequences			0
’ @entity64 ( centre ) scored superb hat - trick for @entity67 that condemned @entity1 to a 4 - 3 loss asked if there was much more the club could do , @entity0 replied : ‘ that ’s very hard for the club to control			1
that ’s the responsibility of the supporters and the supporters clubs			0
‘ we need to be finished with it and concentrate on football			0
it ’s about values and how we want other nations and teams and people to look at @entity1			0
it ’s been fantastic for so many years and 99.9 per cent is good now as well			0
that ’s one of the biggest things about @entity1 – the supporters – and we have to keep up that reputation			2
’ last year the club was fined £ 42,000 after fans displayed an ‘ illicit ’ banner at a @entity90 clash with @entity91			1
earlier that season , @entity7 fined them £ 4,221 after fireworks were set off during a qualifier with @entity95			1
@entity1 players look dejected after conceding another goal , despite the result being ultimately meaningless during the 2011/12 @entity14 campaign , @entity1 were fined £ 21,000 for an offensive banner and setting off of flares at @entity102 and £ 13,000 for ‘ illicit chanting ’ against @entity104			1
@entity1 denounced the behaviour of the one fan they said was responsible for the flare - and urged supporters to take more responsibility			1
a statement read : ‘ around 1,200 @entity1 supporters enjoyed an excellent visit to @entity32 and were welcomed warmly by the city , enjoying a very friendly atmosphere			2
it is extremely disappointing therefore that the actions of one individual have had such a negative impact			0
‘ there can be absolutely no excuse for the use of flares or any other pyrotechnics			0
the threat to the health and safety of supporters caused by their use in football grounds is well known and we have repeatedly asked for this practice to stop			0
‘ the small handful of individuals who have been involved in behaviour of this kind in @entity32 and on other occasions have done nothing but embarrass the @entity137 and tarnish the excellent and hard - earned reputation of @entity1 supporters			1
‘ we try to do all we can to stop such behaviour , however , we can only do so much - people must take responsibility			2
clearly we will deal with any individuals identified in the strongest terms			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 remains hopeful that @entity148 , who will train with the first - team squad for the first time today since picking up a minor knee injury against @entity147 , can be a permanent @entity1 player before the @entity24 tie			2
‘ we ’re talking and have an arrangement with the agent , so it ’s going the right way , ’ he said .			0
