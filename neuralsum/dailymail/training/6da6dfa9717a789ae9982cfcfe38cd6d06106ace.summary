he may have been the ruler of an empire that covered most of @entity2 , but the final resting place of @entity4 remains a mystery			1
after dying of a sudden illness in 1227 at the age of 72 , the @entity7 leader was buried at a secret location that has yet to be uncovered			1
legend says that as his body was carried to its final resting place , anyone encountered along the route was put to the sword before those escorting the body also killed themselves			1
more than 10,000 volunteers tagged stuctures , roads and rivers on satellite images as part of the project but now scientists , aided by a team of amateur archaeologists , believe they are close to finding the final resting place of the first @entity32 emperor			1
by scouring more than 84,000 satellite images of the area where he suspected of being buried , more than 10,000 volunteers identified sites that looked like they might be of archaeological signficance			1
@entity4 has 16 million male descendants living today , according to dna research			2
scientists have traced a cluster of extremely similar y - chromosomes back to a single ancestor living in @entity44 around 800 years ago			1
they believe the only man with the opportunity to father enough children would have been the @entity32 warlord			0
within 80 years he built an empire that covered much of @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
the findings confirmed earlier studies that @entity4 's dna fingerprint was widespread over the @entity59 subcontinent			1
the highest concentration of ' @entity62 ' carriers was in a group of ethnic @entity64			0
@entity65 , an accountancy professor whose ancestors came from the @entity67 , was the first man outside @entity2 to be identified as carrying the @entity4 chromosome			1
it was found that professor @entity65 's paternal forebears came from the @entity71 near the @entity72			0
the crowdsourcing project allowed the researchers to survey an area of 6,000 sq km ( 2,316 square miles ) , an area twice the size of @entity77			1
in a paper published in the journal @entity80 , they claim to have identified 55 potential archaeological sites that could be home to the remains of @entity4			1
the team were then able to visit some of the sites in @entity44 to carry out ground surveys and use drone aircraft to take pictures from above			2
dr @entity89 , the researcher who led the project at the @entity92 and @entity93 at the @entity94 , in @entity95 , and a self - confessed @entity4 obsessive , said the work has brought them closer to finally answering the question of where @entity4 is buried			2
dr @entity89 said that using the help of the public through crowdsourcing helped his team plough through enormous quanities of information that would would have taken years for a single archaeologist to survey all the satellite photos			2
he added : ' looking at the data size challenge , we have surveyed a historically significant area of roughly 6,000km2			2
' a ground survey of this detail for the entire range would have been prohibitive			0
' a single archaeologist would have had to scroll through nearly 20,000 screens before covering the whole area			0
' legendary : the @entity7 leader built one of the largest empires ever seen in just 80 years but the location of his final resting place after he died remains a mystery ( actor playing @entity4 pictured ) while the tomb has still to be found , monuments and statues like the one above exist all over @entity44 the satellite images helped the archaeologists find 55 sites that were archaeologically interesting like a circular khirigsuur burial mound ( labelled a and b ) , and stone megaliths known as ' deer stones ' ( labelled c ) most experts believe @entity4 was buried somewhere in a valley near the sacred @entity32 mountain of @entity140 , near his birthplace in @entity142 , northeastern @entity44			1
despite building up an empire that stretched from the @entity145 to the @entity146 , little more is known about where his remains were buried			0
recent research has shown that one in every 200 men on the planet is genetically related to @entity4 , yet his tomb remains a secret			1
his direct descendants who followed him as @entity4 are also thought to have been buried alongside him			2
accounts by traders such as @entity157 who served with the @entity158 in the @entity159 describe how the great @entity160 were buried			0
he described how they were taken to a great mountain called @entity162 and anyone encountered on the route was killed			0
it is said that when @entity166 , the grandson of @entity4 , died more than 20,000 men were put to the death after encountering his body			0
popular legend also says that the area around the tomb where @entity4 was buried was also trampled by horses for month to obliterate signs of the grave			1
@entity4 was initially called @entity4 when he was born in 1155 or 1162 near @entity140 mountain the mausoleum of @entity4 ( above ) , built in @entity178 in @entity179 in 1954 , attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year , but the location of the actual tomb that contains his remains has been lost in an attempt to find this legendary @entity186 , and the tomb of their first great leader , volunteers were asked to tag modern and historic features and structures on satellite images			1
within six months 10,000 people had spent a total of 30,000 hours , or 3.4 years , tagging more than 2.3 million sites as part of the project , that was conducted with @entity197			2
from these the research team were able to narrow down the list to 100 accessible locations , of which 55 appeared to have archaeological significance			0
these included circular ' khirigsuur ' burial mounds and rectangular burial mounds ranging from the @entity205 to the @entity7 period			2
the search also found stone megaliths and ancient city fortifications			0
@entity4 is thought to be buried in the legendary @entity210 near to @entity140 mountain the researchers visited some of the 55 sites and surveyed them from the air using drone aircraft although the researchers visited the sites identified , digging at these locations is highly controversial and previous attempts to excavate potential tombs in @entity44 have been deeply unpopular with the public			1
instead the researchers may have to use ground penetrating radar and other equipment in an attempt to narrow down their search further			0
dr @entity89 said : ' in total , a wide variety of archaeological material was identified from the crowd based analytics , ranging from 10 meter diameter rock piles to 200 meter wall structures			0
' he added that their project had also shown the power of using crowdsourcing to help scientific and archaeological studies			0
he said the recent attempt to locate the missing @entity243 , where 8 million participants surveyed satellite images for signs of the plane showed the power of such techniques			1
he said : ' the shear mass of participation in this example provides a glimpse of the potneital of our networked society			0
' these crowdsourcing activities help us dive into the unknown and extract the unexpected			0

final resting place of @entity7 leader has remained a secret for 800 years
his tomb is said to be near @entity140 mountain in north @entity44
scientists used crowdsourcing to scour 84,000 satellite images of the area
more than 10,000 volunteers surveyed more than 2,300 square miles
they identified 55 archaeological sites that could be @entity4 's tomb
archaeologists believe they are closer than ever to finding his burial site
