by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 relief : @entity4 with his mother @entity5 yesterday			1
he will not face any criminal charges @entity4 ’s ten - year nightmare was finally over yesterday after police and prosecutors decided he will not stand trial in @entity11			1
the computer hacker won his fight against extradition two months ago when @entity15 blocked @entity17 demands to send him there			2
that decision marked a victory for the @entity22 ’s @entity21 to @entity11 justice campaign			1
now director of public prosecutions @entity25 has announced that the 46 - year - old @entity28 ’s sufferer , who medical experts warned would be very likely to kill himself if extradited , will not face criminal charges in this country either			1
speaking last night mr @entity4 said : ‘ this is the cherry on the cake , it ’s just amazing			2
‘ it has been a terrifying experience hanging over me for so long			0
i now feel like a huge weight has been lifted from me			0
’ his mother @entity39 said : ‘ this will be the 11th @entity41 since his arrest and it is the first time we can celebrate			0
‘ we can all now finally breathe a sigh of relief			0
i no longer have the feeling of constant terror that my son will be taken away from me			0
’ the decision not to bring charges came on mrs @entity39 ’s 64th birthday			0
she added : ‘ i could n’t ask for a better birthday present			0
‘ it ’s just wonderful			0
the next thing i would like to get , impossible though it seems , would be a pardon from president @entity59			0
’ mrs @entity39 said she hoped that the @entity17 authorities would now drop their extradition warrant for her son , who has always been willing to stand trial in the @entity11			1
threat : the autistic alleged hacker was saved from extradition to the @entity17 in october ‘ he regrets what he ’s done			2
he wishes he had n’t done it			0
he wishes he had n’t upset the @entity17			2
but i ’m grateful to @entity15 that this is all over now			0
’ if extradited , mr @entity4 , from @entity73 , @entity74 , faced up to 60 years behind bars for hacking into @entity77 and @entity78 computers looking for the existence of ‘ little green men ’			2
but in a dramatic , 11th - hour decision in october , the home secretary defied @entity17 demands and blocked his removal under the controversial @entity85			1
her announcement , in a statement to the @entity88 , drew cheers from @entity90 and marked a watershed for the @entity22 campaign , launched in 2009 to allow mr @entity4 to be tried here			1
relief : ms @entity39 spoke of her joy at seeing her son cleared on friday , which is her birthday saga : mr @entity4 , pictured in 2005 , has been embroiled in his legal battle for more than a decade the campaign had attracted widespread political support and celebrities had also added their voices in the fight to keep him in the @entity11			1
mrs may told @entity90 that his extradition ‘ would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with mr @entity4 ’s human rights ’			2
his fate then rested in the hands of the @entity114 , who had to decide whether mr @entity4 should stand trial in a @entity11 court			1
in a statement on behalf of the @entity118 and @entity119 , mr @entity25 said nothing had changed from 2002 , when it was decided that the appropriate place for a trial was the @entity17			1
he said : ‘ most of the witnesses are in the @entity17 , as is nearly all the physical evidence and the bulk of the unused material , some of which is sensitive			2
’ no charge : @entity25 , the @entity130 , ruled that mr @entity4 should not stand trial @entity11 prosecutors met @entity17 justice officials last month to discuss transferring the case to @entity11			1
but mr @entity25 said : ‘ the potential difficulties in bringing a case in @entity138 and @entity139 now should not be underestimated , not least the passage of time , the logistics of transferring sensitive evidence prepared for a court in the @entity17 to @entity74 for trial , the participation of @entity17 government witnesses in the trial and the need fully to comply with the duties of disclosure imposed on the @entity118			1
‘ the prospects of a conviction against mr @entity4 which reflects the full extent of his alleged criminality are not high			0
’ how @entity22 took up the fight the @entity17 had been willing to co-operate , said the @entity114 , but he added : ‘ however , they do not consider that making all the @entity17 witnesses available for trial in @entity74 and transferring all of the @entity17 material to this jurisdiction would be in the interests of justice given our representations and the reasons for the decision that the @entity17 was the appropriate forum			1
’ mr @entity4 ’s lawyer @entity168 said : ‘ i have mixed feelings about this – i am pleased he is not going to be prosecuted because i would n’t want to think he would ever spend any time in prison given his mental situation			0
‘ but i am disappointed because the extradition warrant is still outstanding because he ca n’t travel anywhere outside of the @entity11 and will have this hanging over him until it ’s resolved			0

@entity4 will not face charges , says @entity130
difficulty of *co-ordinating* @entity17 and @entity11 authorities made trial *impractical*
@entity187 *'s* legal victory comes after long - running campaign led by the @entity22
