when @entity2 started putting on weight as a teenager , her well - meaning @entity0 suggested that she swap her favourite full - fat @entity5 for the lower - calorie diet version			1
she duly slimmed down , but soon developed an astonishing obsession with the fizzy drink which has seen her spend as much as £ 150,000 over the last three decades			1
at one stage the single mother of five would finish up to 50 cans a day – more than three per waking hour			1
@entity2 says she is addicted to @entity14 and drinks about 10 litres a day			1
this is the amount she drinks every week she was consuming more than 28 pints of @entity14 every day , the equivalent of double her own body weight a week			1
miss @entity2 , who quit her job at a dry cleaners 16 years ago to go on maternity leave , found her habit was also financially draining – costing her around £ 500 a month at her worst			1
and while she has tried to tackle her addiction she still gets through the equivalent of 30 cans a day			2
at one point , her 30 - year dependence became so severe she was spending £ 500 a month on the drink yesterday at her home in @entity29 , @entity30 , the 42 - year - old pleaded for help , saying : ‘ this addiction is taking over my life			1
i wo n’t do the school run unless i have at least two bottles in my bag			0
‘ i ’ve only got one bottle in the house so i ’m feeling quite panicky			0
i ’m sweating , shaking and pacing up and down			0
‘ i ’ve reached a point where this has got to stop			2
’ ms @entity2 is now seeking medical treatment , including hypnotherapy , to conquer overcome her addiction after suffering hallucinations as a result of consuming so much miss @entity2 said she suffers constant headaches and recently began experiencing hallucinations which she blames on the drink			1
‘ i see strange things like oranges flying across the room , ’ she said			0
‘ i dread to think what my insides look like			0
’ miss @entity2 recently visited her gp , but he told her there was nothing he could do			2
but dr @entity57 , a dietitian for the @entity58 , urged her to try cognitive behavioural therapy – as she said the phosphoric acid contained in the drink would eventually damage her bones			2
she added : ‘ this woman is suffering cravings that are influencing her life			0
@entity14 is part of her routine and the reward system in her brain may be responding to it			2
’ she also suffers from constant headaches and has recently started to experience hallucinations , which she puts down to her dependence on @entity14 ms @entity2 says she panics if she does n't have access to a constant supply of the fizzy drink ' @entity5 has become part of her routine and the reward system in her brain may be responding to it			1
' @entity76 drinks contain phosphorous , which is not harmful in small doses			0
but if it 's consumed in very large doses it can be bad for bone health			0
it 's this lasting damage that is worrying			0
" but my biggest concern is that if this woman is filling herself up on @entity14 she will not be eating a balanced diet and giving her body the nutrients it needs			2
' there are things she can do to break the habit			0
in this case , her perception is everything , so i would suggest @entity96			0
' this is often used for people with eating disorders , and could help her change her behaviour and learn to cope without @entity14			2
' ms @entity2 has now vowed to seek help from a hypnotherapist to help change her behaviour and wants to warn others about the dangers of fizzy drinks			1
she said : ' to anyone who drinks quite a lot of fizzy drinks already , i 'd urge them to be very aware of the potential extreme impact it can have on your life , like it has on mine			0
' low - calorie fizzy drinks like @entity14 can aid weight loss , but the chemicals used to make them can still cause health problems			1
phosphoric acid is listed in the ingredients of @entity5 , @entity14 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , as well as many own - brand colas			1
but while a certain amount of phosphorous is vital to bone and tooth health , scientists say excessive consumption raises the risk of developing brittle bones			0
the drinks also contain caffeine which in large quantities can stop the body from absorbing iron			0
and some experts have linked @entity14 ’s sweetening ingredient , aspartame , with premature birth and even cancer , although the @entity145 food watchdog last year rejected the claims .			1

at one point , @entity2 , 42 , was drinking more than three cans an hour
drinks up to 10 litres a day and panics if she does n't have constant supply
has suffered hallucinations as a result of consuming so much of the drink
stay - at - home mother spends around £ *6,000* a year on her @entity14 habit
