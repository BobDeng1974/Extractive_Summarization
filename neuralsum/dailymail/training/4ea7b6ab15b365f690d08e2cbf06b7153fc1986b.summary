by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 16:59 est , 26 september 2013 she was the former merchant navy sailor turned sixties icon , cabaret star , baroness and one of the most famous beauties of the age			1
but april @entity10 's pretty face hid a secret			1
she had been born a boy named @entity10 and , at the age of 25 , became one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery			1
now her incredible story is the subject of a new exhibition , @entity10 : @entity20 , which opens tomorrow at the @entity22			2
' i could never have imagined that when i left @entity35 sixty years ago i would one day return to an exhibition about my life in the museum ! ' ' april has had an astonishing life but throughout it all she has fought for her rights , and provided advice and support for those suffering similar discrimination , ' added curator @entity47			2
born in 1935 in @entity35 , the former @entity10 was one of six children born to a father serving in the navy and an abusive mother			1
' she used to hang me upside - down and bang my head on the floor , ' @entity10 explained , in a candid interview with the @entity56			2
' she also whipped me so badly that there was a hole in my back the doctor could put his thumb into			0
' desperate to get away , @entity10 joined the merchant navy at 14 but it proved an unhappy experience , compounded by the fact that at the age of 15 , she remained sexually underdeveloped			0
family : @entity10 ( centre ) suffered terribly at the hands of his abusive mother while growing up unbearable : april , pictured as a boy ( left ) and as a pre-op transsexual ( right ) says surgery changed her life discharged after attempting suicide , she was sent to a mental institution in @entity80 before being released and moving to @entity81 in 1950			1
here , her astonishing transformation began , speeding up after she moved to @entity30 and became a cabaret drag queen , performing under the name of april @entity85 by the age of 25 , april , who says she had felt that she was in the wrong body from the age of three , had concluded that dressing and living as a woman was n't enough and in 1960 , she underwent gender realignment surgery at the hands of pioneering surgeon dr @entity93 in the @entity95 city of @entity96			1
' i knew i could n’t have gone on living like that , ' she told the telegraph of her decision to submit to a type of surgery that was then in its infancy			0
' anything was preferable , really			0
and , as soon as i woke up , i had the most extraordinary feeling			0
even though i ’d lost a lot of blood and all my hair had fallen out , it was as though my brain was in tune with the rest of my body for the first time in my life			0
' glamorous : april in a photograph taken by @entity118 during her modelling heyday in 1961 icon : @entity118 ( left ) is the subject of an exhibition of his own and was played by @entity124 in a 2012 film stunning : april bears a striking resemblance to @entity127 in this sultry 1964 photograph after a lengthy recovery , april returned to the @entity130 where her modelling career took off courtesy of appearances in @entity135 and shoots with photographer @entity118			1
but her origins - and her operation - remained secret until in 1961 , a ' friend ' sold her story to the @entity140			1
the fall out was devastating and both her modelling and fledgling film careers were crushed by the scandal			0
after being ' outed ' as transsexual , april 's life - in particular her romances - regularly made the headlines , including her controversial divorce from @entity150 @entity149 - later 3rd @entity148 – in 1970			2
the judge ruled that april remained a biological man and the marriage was therefore invalid and annulled - setting a legal precedent that endured until 2004 when the law was finally changed			0
since then , she has lived a wonderfully full life , claiming to have had affairs with @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 albeit while struggling to scratch a living as a waitress , hostess and art seller in @entity30			2
recognition : april is presented with her mbe for services to transgender equality by @entity169 in 2012 two years ago , april moved home to the @entity130 and now lives in a south @entity81 flat			1
she also , in 2012 , was awarded an mbe for services to transgender equality			1
nevertheless , she has admitted that she still feels a sense of isolation , despite her achievements and the growing public acceptance of transgender people			0
' i ’m so tired of being told i ’m loved , ' she said , speaking to the @entity56 , ' and then people do n’t even bother ringing me up to see how i am			0
' with the launch of the new exhibition , perhaps that will finally change			0
april @entity10 : @entity20 runs until september 2014 at the @entity22			1
