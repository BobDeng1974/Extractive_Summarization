by @entity0 published : 00:53 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 17:13 est , 7 july 2013 another day , another @entity7 first - this time it 's a @entity3 man wandering the boardwalk of a beach resort thursday night believes he caught the first fight ever filmed by @entity7 , and of course it was on the @entity10 video posted to @entity11 is actually the aftermath of the fight more than it is the actual fight , but the amount of access and footage filmed without anyone noticing is both remarkable and startling			2
fun 's over : @entity21 , @entity20 police arrested this bro july 4 after he fought other bros on the beach resort 's boardwalk the video starts with @entity27 walking down the boardwalk , taking in all that @entity21 , @entity20 has to offer on a warm summer evening			0
it then takes a turn for the worse when there ’s a loud @entity34 shirtless male – because @entity35 – that appears to be the main perpetrator in the beach brawl pushes his way through the crowd , walking right past @entity27 without even knowing he is being filmed			0
smile : you 're on camera ! using @entity7 , @entity27 filmed several people being arrested without the knowledge or consent of anyone involved busted : remarkably , @entity27 was able to wander right up to cops arresting a group of young bros without being stopped or told to go away ‘ i was able to get much closer with the glasses than if i had had a camera			1

’ undercover : @entity27 was able to hide in plain sight , filming everything , because the general public is n't yet hip to @entity7 unveiling : @entity76 , senior vice president of engineering at @entity77 , presents @entity7 to start the keynote at @entity79 a documentary filmmaker himself , @entity27 is more excited than nervous about how easy it is to film anyone , anywhere at any time without their consent or knowledge			2
