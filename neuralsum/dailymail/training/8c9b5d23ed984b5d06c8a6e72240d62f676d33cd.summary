by @entity1 reporter published : 08:40 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 20:30 est , 26 february 2013 @entity2 is to pay £ 66million in compensation to parents whose children ran up massive bills using its free apps			1
youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents ’ credit cards			1
now as many as 23million people in the @entity15 are eligible for a refund			1
however , the decision is unlikely to affect @entity19 families			0
hidden costs : @entity21 is one of the free - to - download games from @entity24 that has in - game purchases which lure youngsters into spending their parents ' money a number of software companies have developed games that are popular with children			1
these ‘ bait apps ’ let you buy credit in order to progress through the game			2
when children purchase ‘ currency ’ , their parent ’s @entity24 account gets automatically charged			1
@entity2 started requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in march 2011			0
but many parents around the world had already been hit by large and unexpected bills			0
a @entity15 legal case was triggered by a nine - year - old girl from @entity51 who bought $ 200 ( £ 132 ) of ‘ virtual money ’ from three free @entity2 games			1
in a lawsuit brought by her father , the games were described as ‘ highly addictive ’ and designed to ‘ compel ’ children to buy game currency			1
under the terms of the case settlement , @entity2 has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $ 100million ( £ 66million )			1
the company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the @entity19			0
those claiming $ 30 or more from @entity2 may choose to receive a cash refund instead of an @entity24 store credit , according to the filing			1
the case involves games such as @entity21 , @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75 , some of which are offered as free downloads on tablets such as @entity2 's @entity80			1
money down the drain : payments are taken automatically from the credit cards of the adult owners of the computer or smartphone via , for example , an @entity24 or @entity90 account often , the first time a parent finds out about the purchases is when their credit card is rejected at a check - out till or they find a black hole in their current account			1
the lawsuit , filed by five parents in 2011 , involved allegations surrounding purchases in certain downloaded apps , which plaintiffs claim were made by children without the knowledge or permission of the account holder			1
the lawsuit also alleged that ' @entity2 failed to adequately disclose that third - party @entity112 , largely available for free and rated as containing content suitable for children , contained the ability to make in - @entity116			1
' the founder of parenting website @entity117 , @entity117 , told the @entity1 earlier this month : ‘ we have heard of cases where parents have been hit with bills for hundreds of pounds as the apps are often linked to their card details through @entity24			1
often the bills are n’t immediate and it takes days to find out they have been charged			0
’ last year , six - year - old @entity128 spent £ 1,000 playing @entity73 , which was free to download , on his mother ’s @entity80			1
his parents only discovered the problem after receiving a call for their bank ’s fraud team who had concerns with ‘ unusual activity ’ on their account			2
taking aim at @entity2 : today 's proposed settlement requires court approval			0
the court will hear the settlement on march 1			0
@entity128 ’s mother @entity145 , 31 , a nursing support assistant , from @entity146 , said : ‘ we had no idea the money was even going out of our account until the fraud squad at the bank rang us			2
‘ and when we looked at our bank account and found such a large amount of money missing i felt absolutely sick			2
’ in theory , @entity2 accounts require users to input a password to clear any purchases			0
however , if the parent uses the password once , this creates a 15 minute window where the child can then make a series of purchases			0
separately , children who have become engrossed in a game will often pester their parents continuously to allow them to make purchases			0
@entity172 of app protection firm @entity171 said : ‘ app developers are not often altruistic			0
‘ they often include in - app purchases hidden behind the free price tag			2
either they offer a small amount of play , then charge for continued use ; offer in - app purchases for more in - game content such as extra areas of play or upgrades ; or they constantly interrupt game play to ask for in - app purchases			2
’ @entity189 , founder of @entity190 , said : ‘ it ’s all too easy for our children to get sucked into games and , before you know it , they ’ve racked up huge costs buying coins , berries and doughnuts			2
‘ you do need to keep an eye on your child ’s device settings and to keep your password for purchases private at all costs			0
’ which ? executive director @entity208 said : ‘ it ’s far too easy for children to run up huge bills on phone apps when most default settings allow ‘ in - app purchases ’ without asking for a confirmation or password			0
‘ if your child has run up a huge bill without your knowledge , contact the app store or manufacturer , as you may be eligible for a refund			2
’ @entity2 said : ‘ all @entity225 devices have built - in controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content , such as internet access and age - rated content			0
‘ parental controls also give parents and guardians the option to turn off functionality , such as purchasing from @entity24 , and the ability to turn off in - app purchases			1
’ today 's proposed settlement requires court approval			0
the court will hear the settlement on march 1			0
@entity2 could not immediately be reached for comment outside of regular @entity15 business hours .			0
