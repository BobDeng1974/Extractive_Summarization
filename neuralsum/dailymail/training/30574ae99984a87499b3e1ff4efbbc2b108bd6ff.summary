by @entity0 a pre-teen girl attempts to fake her first period , using glitter no less , in a hilarious new ad for @entity6 's @entity5 - but her mother teaches her a lesson she 'll never forget			1
in ' @entity11 ' @entity10 's scheme is brilliantly foiled by her mom , who throws an excruciatingly embarrassing ' first period party , ' eventually leading her daughter to fess up			1
the bash features cringe - inducing activities , such as a ' uterus piñata ' and a ' pin the pad on the period ' game			1
there ’s even an allusion to ' vagina cake			1
' unsurprisingly , the video has garnered more than 1.8 million views since it was uploaded to @entity26 on tuesday			1
not buying it : @entity6 's new ad sees a pre-teen fake her first period by painting a sanitary pad with red nail polish , not fooling her mother ( pictured ) for a moment @entity10 opens the ad lamenting the fact that she has yet to start her period			1
' first , @entity37 got it			1
then , stupid @entity39 got it			1
and i tried everything to get my period , ' says @entity10			1
so , i faked it			1
' @entity10 's masterful plan involves dotting a sanitary pad with red glittery nail polish and the young girl appears quite smug with her handiwork ; bragging to her friends on the phone and leaving the pad lying around for her mother to find			1
' @entity10 , what 's this ? ' her mother asks , waggling the item in question			1
' what do you think it is ? ' responds @entity10 sarcastically			1
' i 'm on my lady 's days			1
' ' what do i think it is ? ' her mother says , speaking to the camera			1
but she does n't need to know that			1
' never mess with mom : @entity10 ( left ) is horrified when her mother ( right ) throws an impromptu ' first moon party ' to celebrate her daughter 's ' milestone ' everyone 's invited : hordes of guests show up to the hilariously embarrassing soiree , including @entity10 's grandpa ( center ) and school friends ( right ) @entity10 's mother then informs her daughter that , as per ' family tradition , ' she will be throwing a ' first moon party ' to celebrate this momentous stepping stone in her path towards womanhood			2
after she calls to inquire as to the availability of a ' vagina cake , ' the front door flies open and the party begins			2
' this party is a hit			2
your grandpa is bobbin ' for ovaries like a champ ' ' you 're so grown up ! ' squeals @entity10 's grandfather with an animated embrace			2
' there she is ! i got you the super pack , ' offers one of her mother 's ' co-workers , ' handing @entity10 an auspicious looking package			2
' these are coffee filters , ' @entity10 responds dejectedly			2
' yeah , i was n't sure what brand you liked , ' chortles the man			2
highlights : what period - themed party would be complete without a ' uterus piñata ' ( left ) and a ' pin the pad on the period ' game ( right ) marshmallow anyone ? @entity10 is scarred by the party 's inclusion of a bright red confectionary dipping fountain ( pictured ) an outlandish series of period - themed children 's games ensues , including ' pin the pad on the period , ' a ' uterus pinata , ' a ' vagician , ' and a bright red marshmallow dipping fountain			2
' i used to like marshmallows , ' the poor girl mutters			0
' ' you need to stop this ! no one is having fun , ' @entity10 implores to her mother			0
' what are you taking about ? ' her mother returns			0
' this party is a hit			0
your grandpa is bobbin ' for ovaries like a champ			0
' the life of a tween : @entity10 begs her mother to end the horrendous party , to which her mother responds , ' this party is a hit			0
your grandpa is bobbin for ovaries like a champ ' the stuff of nightmares : when @entity10 's father pops out of a giant cake like a @entity159 ( pictured ) , she reaches her cringe - threshold , and finally comes clean to her mother the traumatized girl finally caves and confesses she 's been faking her period , at which point her mother presents her with a @entity6 period starter kit , presumably for when @entity10 does eventually reach the day she 's been waiting for			0
' what 'd she think , i would n't know ? ' quips the mother			0
' periods do n't have glitter in them			0
' the ad has drawn overwhelmingly positive responses from viewers			0
' i used to like marshmallows			0
not anymore ' ' @entity175 , this is brilliant			0
why you never lie to your @entity177 ! ' comments one			0
wait till you find out this ... is actually a real thing in some parts of @entity181			0
i wanted to hide my face and die , ' writes another			0
even a few men chimed in , with one commenting : ' i know nothing of this particular topic , but ... i actually laughed out loud			0
co-workers looking at me funny and everything			0
