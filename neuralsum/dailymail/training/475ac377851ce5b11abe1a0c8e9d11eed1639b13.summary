by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 12:05 est , 17 october 2013 one of @entity2 's top universities could become the first in the country to install three types of toilet for men , women and transgenders			0
the ' gender neutral ' loos have been requested by the student union at the @entity12 in @entity13 , in a bid to make all students feel more welcome			1
but some students have labelled the idea as ' stupid ' , saying the committee should be spending more time discussing other issues			1
potential layout ? the students union wants to open three toilets which could be arranged like this with the transgender toilet on the right @entity27 communications officer @entity26 said : ' it 's an exciting piece of work			1
we want to break down barriers and make university a more welcoming place for everyone			2
' i think the university are really open to it			0
the @entity12 is a really open community and we want people to know that			1
we want to make people 's experience of university as easy as possible			2
' we are working towards forming the first university trans - student policy and we need your help			0
' to ask trans - people which identity they fit into can be painful , and yet when we have gendered toilets we ask them to do this every day			2
' we 'd like the university to provide more gender neutral toilets alongside single gender toilets so that all of our students are comfortable and safe on campus			0
' but one third - year history student , said : ' it 's stupid			2
have n't the bleeding - heart brigade at the @entity59 got anything better to discuss ? mixed facilities : the students union at the @entity12 wants to bring in three toilets for male , female and transgender students ' while they 're at it , why do n't they build a toilet for midgets ? what a waste of time			1
' the student 's union has also posted on @entity75 , asking people to air opinions on what sort of sign they would prefer to be used			1
a post on the page said : ' some of the people on the @entity83 that will decide this are aware that some international students might have encountered different toilet provision at home and would like to ensure that toilets are instantly recognisable			0
' a @entity12 spokeswoman said : ' the subject has been raised by the @entity27 and the university is in discussion about it			0
' in 2009 , @entity95 introduced the first dedicated sets of transgender toilets in the country in their student night club after the idea was debated by their student council .			0

@entity12 student 's union want to ' break down barriers '
say that asking people to chose which identity fits can be ' painful '
some students have branded the idea as ' stupid ' and a ' waste of time '
