frankly , it sounds like the plot of a charming little tv drama			0
an elderly couple on the eve of their 50th wedding anniversary set off on a canal trip around @entity7 , meandering through the countryside and meeting all sorts of characters , some more madcap than others			1
they have their own eccentricities , which makes for vivid viewing			0
his steering is n't perhaps what it should be so there 's always the possibility of a crash ( and no , viewers are n't disappointed ) ; she 's the sort of woman who hankers for a haircut in the middle of a boating holiday			1
the emotional punch comes halfway in , when it emerges that the ' slight condition ' that makes her a tad forgetful ( not least in remembering to undo the mooring ropes ) turns out to be a form of @entity35 's			1
@entity36 and @entity37 sailing down the canal in their slow boat that they have owned for decades is it a comedy or a tragedy , though ? possibly , like all the best productions , it 's a bit of both , shot through with very @entity7 humour and lashings of tea ( and occasionally something stronger )			1
but this programme is n't fictional - which somehow makes it even more gripping			1
it 's a @entity55 documentary where two of our finest actors , @entity37 and @entity58 - who 've been married for 50 years - take a trip along a series of canal networks , and down memory lane in the process			1
they may be well - known for being two of our most high - profile actors ( and political campaigners to boot ) but away from the tv studio or stage , @entity37 and @entity36 have long been keen narrowboat fans , having owned their own boat for decades			1
while they 've spent the last half - century building their careers ( her most famous role is still @entity77 in @entity78 ; he 's a renowned classical actor who most recently popped up in @entity80 ) , every holiday was spent cruising up and down the canal network in @entity82 and @entity83 and their sons @entity85 ( now an acclaimed actor in his own right ) and @entity88 joined them on their jaunts ( @entity36 also has a daughter , @entity90 , from his first marriage )			1
@entity37 and @entity58 with sons @entity85 ( left ) and @entity88 ( right ) in 1975 ' we 're canal nuts , ' explains a gleeful @entity37 at the start of this televised adventure			1
' we 've been pottering around on them all our married life			0
we 've had some of our best times			0
whenever we get a break we dash off to our boat			1
' indeed , these two were canal nuts many years before narrowboating was fashionable , and the home movie footage that 's spliced alongside film of their current trip is glorious - showing youthful faces and almost empty stretches of canal			1
in narrowboat circles , they 're quite famous ( and for reasons that have nothing to do with acting )			0
they spearheaded a campaign to restore the @entity118 some 24 years ago , and steered the first boat through once the work was complete			1
nearly a quarter of a century on , they return to this stretch of water - now a tourist magnet where the towpaths are awash with day - trippers and cyclists - to see how things have changed			2
at first it seems that everything has			0
the boat they hire ( they still have their own , but it 's moored elsewhere ) has a tv installed , which appals @entity36 , who thinks boating holidays should be all about board games and books and conversation			1
the other striking difference from those bygone days , though , is how they have changed			0
although they look sprightly enough clambering over locks and on and off boats , there 's no getting away from the fact that @entity37 is 81 and @entity36 is 79			1
during the opening sequences they muse over the fact their 50th wedding anniversary is upon them			0
' fifty years - it feels more like 14 , ' says @entity36 , while his wife explains the thinking behind their trip			2
' we 're determined to make the most of what we love - while we still can			2
' they 've always been endearing figures but the glimpse into their marriage offered here is hilarious and touching in equal measure			0
@entity58 in his recent appearance in @entity80 where he played @entity171 on the first morning , @entity36 bemoans the fact that his age means regular toilet trips at night which in the darkness , on an unfamiliar boat , can be ' bad news for the floor '			2
he wonders if he left a puddle			0
she reassures him , saying , ' very good aim , darling			0
' but it 's @entity37 's health that causes more concern			1
it 's long been known in showbiz circles that she has problems with memory loss			2
here , however , they open up about what that actually means			0
' @entity37 has this condition - it 's a sort of @entity35 's , ' says @entity194 ' it 's quite mild , but she ca n't remember things very well			1
' ' you do n't have to remember things on the canal , you can keep your mind vacant and enjoy things as they happen and as you see them			2
it 's perfect for @entity37 , really			1
' not that it 's stopped her doing anything			2
indeed , it emerges that this trip is possibly one of the few activities @entity37 can do that wo n't accentuate her problems			1
' you do n't have to remember things on the canal , ' he explains , neatly glossing over the mooring rope incident			2
' you can keep your mind vacant and enjoy things as they happen and as you see them			0
it 's perfect for her , really			2
' they are n't the sort of couple who always have to agree ( the funniest moments in this film are when they bicker ) , but here they do			2
' it can be a nuisance sometimes , ' @entity37 says , ' but it does n't stop me remembering how to open a locked gate or make the skipper a cup of tea			1
' @entity37 and @entity36 met in repertory theatre in the early 60s , and married in 1963			1
they reckon that between them they 've performed in pretty much every theatre the length and breadth of @entity7 , although a few years back they bemoaned the fact they had n't made it to the @entity244			0
theirs is one of the longest and most successful marriages in showbiz , and they still live in the same house they bought when @entity37 was pregnant with their first child			1
everything about them screams solidity			0
which makes @entity36 's fleeting confession - that his wife is no longer the woman he married - all the more affecting			1
' when you think back over a long period , ' he says at one point during the trip , ' this person i loved and enjoyed this , that and the other with does n't really exist any more			0
' @entity37 is most famous for her role as @entity269 in @entity78 but as soon as the admission comes , it 's brushed away and replaced with the optimism and joie de vivre that seems to characterise their marriage			1
' but you must n't think like that			0
let 's just take it from day to day			2
you notice how much she 's able to do and how much she enjoys life			2
' @entity37 is quick to accentuate the positive too - usually with a dash to the kettle			1
' i certainly do enjoy life and i can still perform my duties as crew , ' she says , making another cup of tea and serving up the shortbread			0
' her sense of humour is still there , ' confirms @entity295 ' the same things make her laugh and we have a lot of fun			0
she 's just growing old and , in a certain area , more quickly than either of us would like			2
but we 're very lucky , really			0
' this is a three - part documentary series , each part focusing on a different canal trip			1
viewers get a dollop of history ( ' when it was built the @entity315 canal was the @entity316 of its day ' ) and an appreciation of geography ( although it was filmed pre-floods , when the sun seemed to be permanently shining )			2
@entity37 and @entity36 would probably quibble with the idea that the programme is about them , given that it focuses on them meeting all manner of fellow canal lovers			1
@entity37 manages to get her haircut during the trip - courtesy of a hairdresser who runs @entity7 's only known floating salon			1
they also pop in to meet a young couple who not only holiday on the canals but have set up a permanent home on the water			2
yet as a portrait of their marriage , and well - lived lives , it is spot on ( and the fact that it 's gentle and completely unshowbizzy is a bonus )			1
so what 's the attraction , for them , of a life on water ? @entity37 sums it up			1
' people are terribly friendly on the canal			0
there 's a nice feeling about it			0
i think it 's something to do with life at four miles an hour			0
it attracts people who like that rhythm			0
each canal is different but they all offer this wonderful antidote to the hustle and bustle of modern life			0
you ca n't rush on a canal			0
' the enduring image of them is of him steering , while she gazes out the window , lost in her thoughts			0
' do i know where we 're going or why we 're going there ? ' she says			0
' well , sometimes i do , and sometimes i just want to watch the countryside slide by			0
' long may they sail			0
