bungling @entity1 agents held a terrified mother at gunpoint for 30 minutes after chainsawing their way into her home - before realising they had raided the wrong address			1
officers stormed into @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity10 , apartment at 6.04am on january 26 after using the blade to cut through her front door			1
the 29 - year - old was then held face down on the floor as her three - year - old daughter ji - anni cried in another room			1
but the red - faced agents soon let her go after realising they were supposed to have targeted the home of an alleged drug dealer which was on the same floor of the building			1
she said : ' i just happened to glance over and saw this huge chainsaw ripping down the side of my door			1
and i was freaking out			0
i did n't know what was going on			0
' she said the door was kicked open , adding : ' that 's when i heard the clicking of a gun and i heard ' @entity1 , get down ! ' , so i laid right on down			2
' and they said get your dog , so i got her and at the same time i am laying in her urine because she did pee on herself at the same time			0
' she said the agents told her not to move and so was unable to help her daughter , who was screaming for help in the room next door			1
soon enough , though , they realised their mistake and moved in on her neighbour @entity66 , who uses the street name @entity68			2
devastated : @entity9 ( left ) said her young daughter @entity69 ( right ) was left alone as she was forced to lie face down on the floor wrong place : @entity1 agents targeted the apartment of a mother , rather than that of an alleged drug dealer the 41 - year - old was later arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine base			1
an @entity1 spokesman in @entity82 said the agency would pay for the damage caused to her home			2
he said the arrest team was only in the wrong apartment for about 15 minutes , and that the special agent in charge at the scene repeatedly apologised for the mistake			0
but @entity9 said she remained unhappy			1
she told @entity93 and @entity94 : ' just a little pat on the back and saying ' i 'm sorry ' is not ok			0
' ' for me it felt ( like a ) routine apology , it felt like just a regular , ' i 'm sorry for the inconvenience			0
' here 's the phone number for your landlord to get reimbursed for the door , have a good day			2
and that 's how i felt , like it was a smack in the face			0
' the botched raid was part of a two - year probe by federal and state authorities into illegal gun sales , drug trafficking and gang activities they dubbed @entity118			0
the raids resulted in the arrest that day of 16 people in the @entity8 area for drug offences .			0
