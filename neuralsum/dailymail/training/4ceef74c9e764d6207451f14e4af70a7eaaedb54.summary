@entity10 , which shows a young boy hunched over a sewing machine making @entity14 bunting , appeared on the wall in @entity16 , north @entity6 , last may , just before the @entity18 celebrations			1
it disappeared from the side of the @entity20 last weekend and was due to be auctioned thousands of miles away in @entity9 this evening			1
the rat , bottom right , is believed to be the artist 's response to the work being taken @entity43 ( @entity43 ) were expecting it to reach between 500,000 @entity44 dollars ( £ 328,063 ) and 700,000 @entity44 dollars ( £ 459,288 )			0
but @entity45 said it had been told the sale was halted at the last minute , with no explanation given from the auction house			1
it came as a new mural showing a woman in a nun 's habit appeared in the space left behind by ' @entity10 ' today			1
@entity45 leader @entity56 this evening told of her delight that the sale of the piece was halted			1
she said : ' it 's a true credit to the community that their campaigning appears to have helped to stop the sale of this artwork from going ahead			2
' we will continue to explore all options to bring back @entity3 to the community where it belongs			0
' it is now known if the new mural which appeared today is a @entity3 piece			2
the new mural was spotted by @entity70			2
he told the @entity71 : ' we thought we were just going along to see the gap in the wall and were surprised to see something else had appeared			1
' it could be that @entity16 in @entity45 has got its @entity3 back			2
it could be a happy ending , ' he added			0
' why ? ' the artist appeared to vent his feelings on the row local residents , who become attached to the work by the famous street artist , were left furious that a piece of work given to the community for free could be sold for profit			1
outraged art fans had been bombarding the auction house with abusive calls and e-mails			1
details of the backlash emerged after a stencil of a rat holding a sign that reads ' why ? ' appeared on the @entity45 wall , next to the blank spot where ' @entity10 ' used to be			1
it is thought the rat could be the reclusive graffiti artist 's way of voicing his verdict on the row over his original piece			0
@entity105 , owner of @entity106 , previously insisted the sale of the artwork is legitimate , but admitted he had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from the @entity111			1
' it 's been said that the artwork was stolen , and that 's just not true , ' mr @entity105 told the @entity114			2
' we take a lot of care with our consignors : who they are , what they do , and if there 's any illegality we will not touch it			0
' the street art was stencilled onto the side of a @entity126 shop in @entity16 in 2012 and protected by a perspex screen , but disappeared last week			0
the @entity128 have confirmed they were contacted by authorities in the @entity44 regarding the @entity3 piece			0
they were advised that there had been no reports of theft , @entity131 said			0
@entity44 officials had waded into the row after the disappearance prompted a storm of outrage by furious @entity45 businesses and residents , the @entity135 reported			1
mr @entity105 claimed it is being sold by a ' well - known ' collector who is not @entity111 , but has refused to divulge any more information			0
he added that the painting was being stored in @entity147			0
councillor @entity148 says the artwork was a ' gift ' to his community and had instigated a campaign to get the artwork returned by urging people to e-mail the @entity44 auction website			0
he said : ' the @entity3 appeared last may and created lots of excitement in the area - people were coming from across @entity6 to see it			2
' we were really proud to have a @entity3 in our neighbourhood , so residents were shocked to realise it had been ripped out of the wall			0
new addition : it is thought the reclusive graffiti artist is behind the stencil of a rat that has appeared next to the blank spot where @entity10 used to be ' the community feels that this art was given to us , for free , and it 's now been taken away to be sold for huge profit			1
i 'm very angry about the @entity3 going - we want our @entity3 back ! ' much of the controversial artist 's work is believed to have a political message , and @entity10 is believed to be a statement on sweatshops churning out decorations and memorabilia ahead of the @entity18 and the @entity184			1
in 2008 the graffiti artist @entity3 revealed that millions of pounds worth of works attributed to him were fakes			0
a body set up by the artist to verify his work identified 226 falsely attributed pieces in eight months in 2008			0
he said at the time : ' graffiti art has a hard enough life as it is - with council workers wanting to remove it and kids wanting to draw moustaches on it , before you add hedgefund managers wanting to chop it out and hang it over the fireplace			0
' for the sake of keeping all street art where it belongs i 'd encourage people not to buy anything by anybody unless it was created for sale in the first place			2

@entity45 told the sale of ' @entity10 ' was halted at last minute
no explanation was given from the auction house in @entity9
