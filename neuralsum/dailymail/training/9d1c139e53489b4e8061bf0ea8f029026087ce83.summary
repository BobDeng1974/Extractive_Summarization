there are already devices that track your steps , weight and calories , but the latest gadget flips health tracking on its head by monitoring how many cigarettes you have			0
instead of encouraging people to smoke more , the smart lighter has been designed to shame them into quitting by revealing the true extent of their habit			0
called @entity16 , the device resembles a @entity24 lighter and each time it ’s used , it records the number of cigarettes the user has had and how long it ’s been since they last lit up			1
the @entity16 smart lighter , pictured , was created by a pair of @entity27 - based designers and resembles a @entity24 lighter			1
each time it is used , @entity16 tracks the number of cigarettes an owner smokes on a small led , pictured , and will also flag up how long it 's been since the user last lit up size : 2.6in x 1.6in x 0.4in ( 67 x 43 x 10 mm ) battery : @entity34 ; lasts one week , or a pack a day weight : @entity37 connectivity : @entity39 ( 4.0 ) compatibility : @entity41 and later and @entity42 4.3 and later prices : @entity45 prices begin at $ 79 ( £ 46 ) , but @entity46 is expected to retail for $ 149 ( £ 88 ) when it goes on sale in june a companion app will also track this data over longer periods of time , and can be used to set goals			1
this app can also reveal how much money has been spent on cigarettes , or subsequently saved by cutting back , and helps smokers learn at what times during the day they are smoking the most			2
progress can then be shared with @entity16 's community or with friends on @entity62 and @entity63			2
@entity16 was created by @entity27 - based designer @entity64			1

‘ when smoking before class , @entity112 asked @entity64 how much he smoked that day			0
‘ when he was n’t sure [ we ] started to track their smoking and became frustrated with the existing ways to learn about their smoking habits			0
