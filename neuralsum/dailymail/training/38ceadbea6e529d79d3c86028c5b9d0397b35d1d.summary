by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 05:25 est , 18 june 2013 ' unrelenting pressure ' : culture secretary @entity2 said companies such as @entity4 had not done enough to ensure sickening images are banished from the internet corpses and animals have greater protection from being abused in online pornography than women , campaigners have claimed			1
as web firms are summoned to a @entity16 summit on tackling the tide of internet filth , ministers were urged to close a legal loophole which means it is legal to include scenes of rape in pornography			1
the rule , which insists that actors are over the age of 18 , is at odds with the ban on possessing necrophilia and bestiality			0
an open letter signed by @entity32 , the @entity33 , the @entity34 , rape crisis centres , and academics at @entity39 demands ' urgent action against violent and misogynistic pornography ' found on the internet			2
it adds : ' we specifically want the government to close a loophole in the pornography legislation which allows the lawful possession in @entity48 and @entity49 of pornographic images that depict rape , so long as the actors are over 18			2
' depictions of necrophilia and bestiality are criminalised by the same legislation , meaning that animals and dead people are better protected than women and girls , ' said the letter to the @entity61			0
" a change in the @entity48 law would send a clear message that it is illegal to possess pornographic images that promote sexual violence against women			2
' the call comes as culture secretary @entity2 accused internet firms of ‘ acting blind ’ over the proliferation of child abuse images on the net , as she summons them to a major summit on web safety today			1
she claimed companies such as @entity4 had not done enough to ensure sickening images are banished from the internet - and promised to put ‘ unrelenting pressure ’ on them to do so			1
she revealed that web firms will be tasked with coming back to ministers with action plans to tackle the pernicious issue of child porn before the autumn			1
progress : last week , @entity4 donated £ 1million to the @entity88 , which polices child abuse images and can get them taken down mrs @entity2 said the fact that millions had been pledged by @entity4 before the summit even starts proves their paucity of action beforehand			1
for the last year , the @entity96 has consistently highlighted the scandal of online porn and how easy it is for children to access it			1
the issue was again illustrated in the aftermath of the @entity105 and @entity106 murder cases			0
both killers accessed pornography in the run up to the murders			0
last week , @entity4 donated £ 1million to the @entity88 , which polices child abuse images and can get them taken down			2
' child abuse images are horrific and widespread public concern has made it clear that the industry must take action			1
enough is enough ' culture secretary @entity2 days later , they put aside millions of pounds more to set up a global database of such pictures so they can be more effectively removed			1
and at the weekend , broadband providers @entity122 and @entity124 said they would put up pop - up warnings if anyone tries to link to a page potentially including child abuse images			2
mrs @entity2 claimed that such progress had only taken place because of the impending summit , which opens today			1
‘ child abuse images are horrific and widespread public concern has made it clear that the industry must take action , ’ she said			2
‘ in recent days we have seen these companies rush to do more because of the pressure of an impending summit			0
imagine how much more can be done if they seriously turn their minds to tackling the issue			0
’ ' we ca n't do nothing ' : @entity144 , the prime minister 's adviser on families , has called on internet firms to take action in memory of murdered children @entity106 and @entity105 internet firms have come under growing scrutiny following the conviction of @entity106 , who murdered five - year - old april jones after amassing a library of internet child abuse images			1
mrs @entity2 will demand that the companies use their technological know - how to come up with new way to tackle child abuse images			1
a source at the @entity163 said mrs @entity2 was taking tough action because she was the ‘ only mother ’ around the @entity166 table			1
' i had an incredibly sad meeting last week with the parents of @entity106 and @entity105 who said : " we just ca n’t understand how you can put these terms into the internet " ' @entity144 , prime minister ’s adviser on families the minister had almost got more money out of @entity4 in just a few days than @entity177 had got out of them in the past year			0
the firm only paid £ 6million in corporation tax last year			0
‘ it is clear that @entity88 companies are not doing enough and can do much more , ’ the source said			0
‘ they have not come under this pressure before and therefore have not felt the need to act			0
‘ the summit has already spurred the industry into action			2
the fact that in the last few days alone @entity4 has found £ 4million to invest in this issue and the major @entity191 have all committed to the introduction of splash pages shows that there is so much more than can easily be done when the companies engage			0
‘ why has it taken a @entity16 summit for the industry to realise the seriousness of this issue ? why have these companies ignored the widespread public concern for years ? ‘ companies have acted blind towards systemic problem of child abuse images			0
if they are allowed to act as though they are blind then they do not have to take responsibility			0
they must be made to acknowledge the extent of the problem and take responsibility			0
’ last night @entity144 , the prime minister ’s adviser on families , called on internet firms to take action in memory of murdered children @entity106 and @entity105			1
‘ i had an incredibly sad meeting last week with the parents of @entity106 and @entity105 who said : “ we just ca n’t understand how you can put these terms into the internet ”			0
‘ if i have to sit with parents who ’ve had their children taken from them whilst images , the most appalling images of abuse are then found on those gentlemen ’s computers , we ca n’t sit by and do nothing about that			2
