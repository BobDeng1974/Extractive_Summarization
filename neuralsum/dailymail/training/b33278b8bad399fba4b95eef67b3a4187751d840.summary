by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 30 september 2013 thief : @entity2 , 48 , was convicted today of stealing hundreds of handbags a mother - of - two has been told she is facing jail after she stole more than 900 handbags in a crime spree that lasted three years			1
@entity2 , 48 , took up to £ 500,000 of bags and purses from shops where she would walk in without a handbag then brazenly walk out after removing their security tags			1
@entity15 heard that she took 905 bags and four purses from top designers such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
she then sold them on , frequently getting more than £ 1,000 for each one			2
all the while her husband , planning consultant @entity24 , and grown - up daughters @entity26 and @entity27 had no idea of her one - woman crime wave			1
police branded @entity32 's biggest bag thief after she was caught red - handed by security guards at a shopping centre in @entity35 , @entity36 last december			1
they said she would routinely target @entity39 stores			2
officers were later able to trace @entity24 's criminal ventures around the country by analysing @entity43 from other stores she 'd visited			1
police found two other handbags in her car that she is believed to have stolen that day and discovered ' overwhelming evidence ' of the other thefts			0
the jury heard that the stock taken in the nationwide campaign of thefts would have cost stores more than £ 130,000			1
but because the mark - up on designer bags is so large the shops themselves would have taken closer to £ 500,000 had they sold them all			1
prosecutor @entity62 said : ' a financial investigation had been looking into the case for some time			0
' it is estimated that the value of all the theft would be in excess of £ 130,000 but that does not take into account the shop ’s mark - up			0
' by selling the bags on at a drastically reduced price , @entity73 was able to make more than £ 80,000 between 2009 and 2012 , and admitted converting criminal assets from 838 of the handbags			1
' @entity79 campaign ' : the 905 handbags @entity24 stole included those by @entity19 ( right ) , @entity20 ( centre ) and @entity21 ( left ) neighbours in her home village of @entity86 , near @entity87 , reacted with shock at the secret life of an otherwise ' quiet and respectable ' housewife			1
one said : ' to say everyone is surprised is an understatement - we had no idea			0
' they are a lovely family , she is a good wife and mother			0
there 's never been any suggestion of anything like this going on			0
' mrs @entity2 is quiet and respectable - she is not the sort of person you see with a new handbag every week			2
there 's nothing flashy about her but she likes her holidays			0
' judge @entity109 told the court : ' the defendant was only caught because people in @entity35 happen to be quite diligent			2
' she was caught red - handed with a handbag and in her car were two handbags stolen earlier that day			0
' this lady has pleaded guilty to a campaign of shoplifting			0
for all intents and purposes she has carried out a business , and we are talking about tens of thousands of pounds			0
' it will be a custodial sentence of some length			0
' @entity127 , defending , said @entity24 was a woman of previous good character			2
@entity24 was released on conditional bail and is expected to be sentenced in october .			2
