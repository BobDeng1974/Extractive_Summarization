@entity1 's @entity0 has long been a fortress with no team scoring there in the @entity5 for 663 minutes			1
last season the now @entity7 goalkeeper @entity6 was the reason for that but now the man keeping the clean sheets is @entity12			1
@entity13 looks at the 22 - year - old who has made @entity1 fans forget about @entity6 ... and @entity16			1
no one knew too much about him last season outside of @entity19 and @entity20 so was it a gamble ? you only have to look at his price tag to see how highly - rated he was			0
he cost € 16million ( £ 11.5m ) and that is a @entity28 record for a goalkeeper			0
the 22 - year - old was already @entity20 's number one when he left @entity33 for @entity1 in the summer			1
with experienced goalkeepers such as @entity35 and @entity36 potentially available , going for a young relatively untried keeper looked a gamble but he already looks to have been money well spent			0
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity12 made a big save to deny @entity40 in the early minutes @entity12 gets down low to keep out a shot from @entity43 's @entity42 in the second half a success right from the start of the season ? no. @entity48 likes to ease in new signings especially when they are young and 31 - year - old @entity51 was signed from @entity52 in the close season as back - up			1
but the back - up became first choice because @entity12 had a right hip injury in pre-season and was n't 100 per cent when the campaign started			2
@entity51 played in the league with @entity12 coming in for @entity5 games but in his first match in @entity63 he conceded three goals from three shots			2
he has recovered brilliantly and now the clamour is for him to start all matches			0
@entity68 is thwarted in his attempt to open the scoring against rivals @entity1 he has convinced everyone in @entity1 ? @entity48 's number two @entity73 is a big fan			2
the @entity75 is a former @entity1 keeper and although he does n't train the goalkeepers he is convinced @entity1 have found someone who can keep goal for them for years to come			2
@entity80 who is the club 's keeping coach is just as excited and even @entity82 is a fan			0
the @entity43 keeper said after tuesday 's game : ' he was fantastic in the first 45 minutes			2
we deserved more reward from all the chances we had but we did n't get it because he played so well			0
' @entity12 put in an impressive performance for @entity1 against their great rivals @entity1 on tuesday and it really was a very special first half			1
@entity1 have not allowed a team to get six shots on target in one half of football all season but he stopped them all			2
he also made two more stops in the second half when most of the football was being played at the other end and he had to stay awake			0
has he fitted into the dressing room ? he speaks some @entity104 , some @entity105 , and some @entity106 so he can make himself understood without problems			0
still only 22 and living his first year in @entity108 he is predictably introverted but has a strong enough personality to impose himself on his defence			0
@entity12 stops @entity40 's attempt on goal during the @entity5 quarter - final first leg on tuesday other strengths ? we saw the shot stopping on wednesday but his distribution is also a weapon for @entity1			1
they were camped in their own half in the first 45 minutes against @entity43 unable to get their passing going			0
@entity12 's long – and importantly accurate – throws and kicks forward to @entity125 were an important release			1
how good can he become ? so good he 'll be sold ? @entity1 have already lost two brilliant keepers in @entity16 who they could only keep for one season and @entity6 who they were not able to take from @entity7			0
they will not want to lost @entity12 and with foreign investment from the @entity132 in @entity133 the club does not have to sell it 's best players – he 's at @entity1 for good			1
@entity1 lost two brilliant keepers in @entity16 and @entity6 but the future looks bright with @entity12			1

@entity1 0 - 0 @entity43 : click here for @entity142 's report
@entity12 was the *difference* between a defeat and a clean sheet
the @entity1 goalkeeper denied @entity40 and @entity42
