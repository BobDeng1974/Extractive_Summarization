by @entity0 two of the three selfie musketeers , @entity1 and @entity4 prime minister @entity3 , were reunited at an @entity5 today			1
in december , a photograph of president @entity7 , @entity1 and mrs @entity3 , taken on the @entity4 president 's phone , went viral			1
the legendary picture was taken during @entity12 's memorial service			1
but today there were no iphones in sight and no wide grins on their faces when the pair discussed the topic of @entity20 at an @entity5 summit in @entity22			1
then : @entity7 , @entity1 and @entity3 were all smiles when taking a selfie at @entity12 's funeral now : there were no smiles on show when @entity1 was reunited with @entity4 prime minister @entity3 today during a signing ceremony with @entity20 at an @entity5 summit in @entity22 @entity4 prime minister @entity3 arrived with a smile on her face at the @entity34 head of states summit			1
yet moments later her smile had vanished when engrossed in conversation with @entity1 mrs @entity3 was no longer all smiles when talking to the prime minister although mrs @entity3 arrived at the summit with a grin on her face , by the time she had begun speaking to mr @entity1 , that smile had disappeared altogether			1
after the picture went viral , mrs @entity3 said she wanted to delete the image which she described as not particularly good			1
but instead , mr @entity1 is said to have suggested that it should be auctioned off and that proceeds from the picture go to charity			1
the meeting today was at a @entity50 conference where world leaders signed an association agreement in which they agreed to maintain closer relations with @entity20			2
the landmark political cooperation accord between the @entity50 and the @entity20 committed to the same deal former president @entity55 rejected last november , a decision that led to his overthrow			2
@entity20 prime minister @entity58 , @entity5 presidents @entity59 and @entity61 , and the leaders of the bloc 's 28 nations signed the core chapters of the @entity66 during the @entity5 summit in @entity22			1
soon afterwards , @entity69 president @entity68 signed legislation completing the process of absorbing @entity72 into @entity69 , defying @entity74 leaders who say the @entity76 peninsula remains part of @entity20			2
today 's deal commits @entity20 and the @entity5 to closer political and economic cooperation			1
yet elements concerning free trade will be signed only after @entity20 has held a presidential election on may 25			0
@entity83 president @entity59 , right , looks at his papers as , from second right , @entity20 prime minister @entity86 , @entity87 prime minister @entity1 , @entity89 prime minister @entity88 , @entity91 prime minister @entity90 and @entity93 prime minister @entity92 applaud during a signing ceremony at an @entity5 summit in @entity22 today mr @entity59 , the @entity83 president , said the agreement would bring @entity20 and its 46 million people closer to the heart of @entity34 and a ' @entity34 way of life '			1
' ( @entity102 ) recognises the aspirations of the people of @entity20 to live in a country governed by values , by democracy and the rule of law , where all citizens have a stake in national prosperity , ' he said			0
two sets of the documents were passed around the table for the @entity5 's leaders and @entity58 to sign in a solemn atmosphere			2
mr @entity59 and mr @entity58 then shook hands and exchanged the documents to applause , witnesses said			0
mr @entity55 turned his back on signing the @entity5 agreement last november in favour of closer ties with @entity126 , triggering months of street protests that eventually led to his flight from the country			0
soon afterwards , @entity69 forces occupied @entity72 , a @entity69 - majority region in the far southeast of the country , drawing outrage and sanctions from the @entity136 and @entity5			0
@entity34 heads of state came together today an an @entity5 summit in @entity22			1
the @entity4 president was pictured next to @entity140 mr @entity58 urged @entity34 leaders to move decisively to contain @entity68 with economic pressure or risk the conflict - the most bitter @entity145 confrontation since the cold war - spilling elsewhere into @entity34			1
' the best way to contain @entity69 is to impose real economic leverage on them , ' he told reporters after the signing ceremony			0
' i strongly believe ... the @entity5 will speak in one single strong voice , defending the territorial integrity of @entity20 and protecting the @entity5 itself because @entity156 knows what is the final destination , is it @entity20 or is it @entity5 ? ' yesterday , @entity5 leaders began preparations for economic sanctions if @entity69 expands its footprint in @entity20 , but no details were given on what measures the bloc would take			0
underscoring divisions in @entity34 , which have hampered its response to the crisis in @entity20 , @entity166 president @entity165 said late on thursday that @entity170 could count on tightening relations with the @entity5 but not on membership			0
' i have always considered that @entity20 should be associated with the @entity5			0
it could n't aspire to be a member of the @entity5 , ' he told reporters			0
@entity20 was part of the @entity126 - dominated @entity177 until 1991 and analysts say @entity68 considers @entity20 to be within @entity69 's historical sphere of influence			2
@entity1 's expression was stern today when arriving at the summit in contrast to mrs @entity3 's wide grin @entity20 prime minister @entity86 ( right ) with @entity1 and @entity89 prime minister @entity88 ( left ) some @entity34 policymakers have pushed the @entity5 to open its doors to countries in the east as an incentive to reform and resist @entity69 pressure on those states to shun @entity34			1
but many @entity5 governments , wary of goading @entity69 with which they have had major commercial ties , will not even suggest that @entity20 could one day join the bloc			0
as well as the closer political ties , the @entity194 has agreed to extend nearly 500 million euros ( Â£ 418 million ) worth of trade benefits to @entity20 , removing duties on a wide range of farm goods , textiles and other imports			0
once @entity20 has a new administration and signs a free - trade agreement with the @entity50 , it will have unfettered access to the @entity5 's market of 500 million consumers			2
that has the potential to strengthen @entity20 's shattered economy , but also runs the risk of provoking retaliatory steps from @entity69 , which has already imposed stricter customs checks on trade with @entity20			2
the other burden for @entity170 is meeting the obligations that come with @entity5 political association			0
these include instituting changes to the rule of law and justice in a country long plagued by corruption and repressive governance , and adopting business and environmental standards that will require hard work and long - term investment to meet .			0
