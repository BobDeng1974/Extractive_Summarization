by @entity0 @entity1 will be the only female member of the @entity3 's presenting team at the @entity4 @entity1 wants to hold her tongue about sexism in football today			1
which is just as well given she 's outnumbered , at a rough count , by about 100 to one			1
we 're here in the @entity12 ' swanky @entity11 to meet the team the @entity3 will be sending to cover the @entity4 in @entity14 in less than a fortnight 's time			1
the ' we ' is largely a throng of sports hacks , while team @entity3 includes , among others , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and , er.			1
she 's the one in the little ra - ra skirt and t - shirt style top , looking rather like the cheerleader			1
now , this is the same @entity1 who said of the last @entity4 , ' i 've experienced sexism in my career - comments and situations that are specific to me being a woman			1
it was quite apparent during the @entity4 in @entity35			1
i was staying in quite an isolated place in a high - testosterone environment			2
i just wanted to go back to my hotel and read a magazine			2
' fast - forward four years and @entity1 says , ' now you can look at this room and think , " yeah , i see what she means			1
" ' see it ? you 'd better believe it , these are some very blokey blokes			2
' that 's the way it is			1
there is n't lots of room for women			2
no gaps have been created , ' she says			2
' the same people are doing the job so you 're not going to move somebody on just for the sake of it			0
do you know what i mean ? ' not really			0
this is , after all , the @entity3 - that great champion of equal opportunities and diversity			1
surely they could have rooted out one or two other women with a grasp of the beautiful game to even up the odds from 13 ( the number of blokes on parade for @entity3 ) to one ( @entity1 ) ? ' with the pundits , you 're talking about men who play football , so it 's a man 's world there , ' she says			1
well , it certainly is here			0
you could bottle the testosterone			0
but what about the 29 million women playing football worldwide or , for that matter , those competing in the @entity90 in @entity91 next year ? i suspect @entity94 captain @entity93 might beg to differ with @entity1			1
' i guess while @entity20 's still a presenter , how is a woman ever supposed to come in ? ' @entity1 is not threatened by her male comrades and is often found teasing them - once describing @entity20 as a ' crisp salesman ' she sounds a little restrained , rather than outspoken			1
@entity99 forbid she 's been told to button it			1
she is , after all , at 41 still a trailblazer for women in sports broadcasting who , along with the wonderful @entity106 , helped bring the @entity107 alive			0
we like her forthright views			0
we like her sharp tongue			0
remember her recent hilarious talk at @entity112 when she teased @entity113 about becoming ' a crisp salesman ' , joked about @entity116 ' affair with his sister - in - law and said @entity118 was the ' moodiest , most miserable b * * * * * * i 've ever met in my life ' after he lost the mixed doubles final at the @entity107 ? i last saw @entity1 a few months after that spectacular @entity123			1
she was reeling from her post-sports - extravaganza high , saying , ' i even found it difficult to get excited about football			0
everything felt a bit anti-climactic			0
' now she says , ' i think a lot of people felt that deflation			0
it was such an amazing thing to have been a part of			0
everyone got so excited about it			0
afterwards , it 's hard to go back to regular work			2
it does n't seem as exciting , but life moves on			0
the memories start to disappear a bit			0
' @entity1 had the honour of presenting the @entity123 when @entity1 worked on the @entity107 the games dominated the @entity146 household , with her twins @entity147 and @entity149 , now eight , attending many of the events			1
she 'll be leaving them at home with her husband , former @entity155 rugby international @entity146 , when she travels to @entity14			1
given that her role on team @entity3 will be to follow @entity94 , whose odds of winning the tournament are up there with the ratio of blokes to girls in this room , she might not be away for too long			1
@entity1 adores her children , who were conceived with @entity165			1
@entity1 with her husband @entity146 in 2012 ' when i was at the @entity4 in @entity35 they came out for a few days , ' she says			1
' but i felt a bit bad for the other guys who were missing their kids			0
at that point i thought , " i should n't have done this			0
" you 're there to work			0
' but i think it 's hard for anyone when they 're away from the family			2
i 'm sure there are a lot of times i 'll think , " oh , i 'm missing sports day today			0
you do the job to the best of your ability but you ca n't help but miss your family			0
but it 's a job			2
you just have to keep all the balls in the air			0
' @entity1 is some juggler			1
since the 2012 games she 's been keeping several balls in the air			2
last year , as well as hosting the @entity197 and covering the @entity198 championships from @entity200 , she replaced @entity201 on @entity202			0
she 's also dipped her toe into primetime tv , hosting @entity206 's comedy panel series @entity207 and presenting @entity209 's splash ! alongside @entity210 ( the first series was a ratings winner , the second made more of a plop than a splash with two million fewer viewers )			2
will she be returning with a third series ? ' i do n't know yet , ' she says			0
' @entity218 is really very ... ' she plasters on a smile			0
' hopefully it will , because i did really enjoy it			0
' @entity1 was brought up on football			1
her father , @entity223 , was the @entity224 international footballer and manager whose life fell to pieces along with the rest of the family 's when @entity1 's brother @entity230 , who was signed for @entity231 , dropped dead in the garden while kicking a ball in 1992			1
he was only 15 and suffering from an un-detected heart condition			0
@entity1 now has a fear of everything falling to pieces when the going gets good			1
in fact , eyebrows were raised recently when it was revealed she had invested in the same tax - avoidance scheme as @entity243 , but she moved swiftly to point out that like many others she 'd been misled , and that since 2012 she 's been working with the @entity245 to repay any money owed			2
@entity1 on the set of splash ! with co-hosts , @entity250 and @entity210 , she says she hope that a third series will kick off soon she says she tends to ringfence her fears by pushing herself on and on			1
' this summer we 've got the @entity4 , the @entity254 and then the @entity255 so it 's going to be a fantastic - though busy - work period			1
then in two years we 're back in @entity14 for the @entity107			1
' has she been confirmed as part of @entity3 ? ' yes , ' she says			1
' look , when i was saying that as a woman in a man 's environment when you 've been on the road for three weeks with blokes all the time , you kind of think , " oh i would n't mind a coffee with a girl today , " it 's not because they 're behaving badly			2
they 're just being themselves and being men			0
' i 'm kind of bored talking about it			0
i 'm busy doing my job			0
you never know if this is going to be the last time they ask you , do you ? or when your time 's up			2
i never take any of this for granted			0
' and , with a swish of that flirty little ra - ra skirt , she 's up and off , pushing her way through all that testosterone .			2
