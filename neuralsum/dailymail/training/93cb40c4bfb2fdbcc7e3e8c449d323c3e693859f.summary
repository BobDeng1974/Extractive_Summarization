by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 07:25 est , 30 july 2012 an angry father flew into a rage and smashed up a shop that supplied legal ' bath salts ' type drugs that put his son in hospital			1
@entity8 , 24 , was taken to @entity10 's @entity9 after snorting a powder labelled ' glass cleaner ' that his friends had called ' fake cocaine '			2
according to police reports , his father @entity15 then called the store where his son had paid $ 20 for the legal high and left a message saying : ' you sold my kid bath salts and i ’ll [ expletive ] kill you '			1
dangerous trade : ' @entity25 salts ' and ' glass cleaner ' are synthetic highs named after the innocuous products because they can be legally sold if they are marked as not for human consumption @entity8 had never used any drug stronger than marijuana , he said , but snorted the glass cleaner for the first time one evening because he was upset and had heard it would give him a buzz			1
but by 1.30am his heart was racing wildly , he was sweating heavily and his breathing had become so laboured he thought he would die			2
three days earlier , a friend of the 24 - year - old ’s had apparently called @entity39 hallucinating , afraid that people were trying to kill him			2
@entity8 said the friend had also used the so - called ' glass cleaner ' bought at @entity44 ’s @entity43 , according to syracuse.com			2
@entity8 drove to @entity44 ’s , based in a little strip mall , carrying a miniature wooden baseball bat in his truck , as usual			2
the slight 5 ' 7 " , 120 - pound man then chased off waiting customers , screaming , ' you need some bath salts ? ' shop worker @entity52 arrived and opened up , while mr @entity8 went to his 2003 @entity53 and slid the bat into his trousers			1
he then went into @entity44 ’s and pretended to be one of the customers he had just chased away			2
@entity25 salts are likely to be stimulant drugs such @entity60 or ephedrine			1
the phrase does not refer to a single chemical , but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the @entity66 as long as they are not marked for human consumption – hence the misleading name			1
in high doses , such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour , and terrifying hallucinations			1
here are just a few of the recent crimes said to have been triggered by the dangerous drugs : he asked for bath salts or glass cleaner , he recalled , and @entity52 put a round blue - and - orange package on the glass countertop			1
he claims @entity52 then pulled out a magazine and opened it to a page that showed him how much glass cleaner to take			2
' that ’s when i just went crazy , ' said @entity8			2
he pulled the bat out of his pants and started swinging			1
he smashed the five - foot - long glass counter and a couple of glass ashtrays			1
then he started flinging glass pipes from shelves at @entity52			1
' here ’s a nice one , ' @entity8 remembers yelling as he threw the pipes			2
' here ’s another nice one			2
' he chased @entity52 back and forth behind the counter and the pair grappled before @entity8 returned his bat to the car and gave harding a lecture			0
he said he told @entity52 : ' you ’re a sick man to sell this to these kids , knowing it ’s gon na twist their minds			0
' then he asked @entity52 for the store phone and called the police to tell them what he had done			0
after 10 to 15 minutes , police arrived and took him into custody			0
they charged him with two felonies – criminal mischief and criminal possession of a weapon – which carry a maximum prison sentence of seven years			1
the police report says @entity8 threatened to kill @entity52 in the store			0
but @entity8 said he only intended to scare the clerk			0
' i wanted them to know why i did it , ' he said			0
' the cop asked me and i said , " so people will know			0
so other parents who do n’t even know their kids can buy this type of drug will be aware			0
" ' it sparked in my mind : it ’s all over			0
i ’ve lived my life for 30 years to do good , and tried to raise my kids to do good			0
but i could n’t help it			0
' he said he had thought about letting authorities handle it , but the law does not consider those products illegal			0
the day after @entity8 ’s violence , federal agents and local police raided @entity44 ’s and other head shops across the country			0
agents seized the @entity154 store ’s supply of glass cleaner , among other products , mr @entity52 said in an interview			0
he said said the store did not sell bath salts because they ’re illegal , and claimed the shop was being wrongly accused of peddling harmful drugs			1
a @entity66 @entity163 agent filed an affidavit last week in @entity166 federal court to get a search warrant for the store raids			1
in it , he listed glass cleaners as one of the names drug sellers use to disguise ' highly dangerous chemicals that are ingested by recreational drug users ' as a substitute for marijuana , cocaine , ecstasy and methamphetamine			1
the raids follow months of horrific crimes by people disoriented by synthetic drugs			1
another frustrated parent , a mother in @entity186 , was charged with trespassing two weeks ago after she tried to buy bath salts at a head shop there , then started yelling at employees			1
neither police nor prosecutors would comment on their plans for @entity8			0
' we do n’t want people acting as vigilantes , ' said police sgt. @entity197			0
@entity200 district attorney @entity199 said prosecutors would consider many factors when evaluating the case , as they do in all others			0
in his blog , @entity154 mayor @entity205 asked , ' what juror votes to convict the guy for busting up a head shop that was selling bath salts to his 24 - year - old son ? ' @entity8 , who earns $ 2,400 a month setting up double - wide and modular homes , said he was worried about having enough money to hire a lawyer			1
' i was being a father , ' he added .			0

a mother was charged with trespassing two weeks ago after she started shouting at staff in a shop that sold ' bath salts '
these drugs can be sold legally in the @entity66 as long as they are not marked for human consumption
in high doses , the chemicals can cause violent behaviour and terrifying hallucinations
