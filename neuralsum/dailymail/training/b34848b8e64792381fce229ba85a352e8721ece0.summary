for three decades , the key to identifying a pedestrian struck and killed near an interstate exit ramp sat at investigators ' fingertips			1
they just did n't realize it			0
the man was walking on @entity8 in central @entity9 in 1984 when he was struck by a semitruck			1
with no identification , the only clues he left were a couple of tattoos , a pack of cigarettes and his fingerprints			1
the prints yielded no matches			0
@entity21 's body remained unidentified thirty years later , when the @entity22 asked state police to review cold cases			1
forensic analyst @entity25 went through @entity21 's file and noticed something odd about the ridges and patterns of the fingerprints			2
' it looked to me like right hand prints were on the left hand card because of the way the ridges went through , ' he said			1
he was right : investigators had transposed the prints			2
the right hand was on a card labeled " left " and vice versa			1

attempts by @entity72 to reach @entity71 were unsuccessful friday			0
transposing fingerprints is n't an everyday mistake , but it 's not uncommon , said @entity76 , director of case management and communications for the @entity22			1
