left dangling in mid-air : the mayor 's 2012 @entity2 gaffe few people seem to be in much of a rush during the rush hour here			1
there is certainly nothing that could be described as a queue at this station			2
at times , there is no one at all			2
according to the mayor of @entity16 , @entity15 , the £ 60 million trans - @entity18 shuttle — @entity21 ’s first urban cable car , no less — is a ‘ much - needed new river crossing in the east of our great city ’			1
he has even incorporated it into the hallowed @entity29 map			0
however , according to figures just revealed ( but only after a @entity33 request ) , this is arguably the most pointless piece of public transport in the country			1
for since its grand opening two years ago , the total number of commuters using the panoramic @entity38 to travel to work appears to have fallen to an all - time low — of none at all			1
this astonishing statistic is based on the number of @entity44 ( @entity16 travel passes ) used on the cable car during a given week this autumn			1
regular users are deemed to be those who take the £ 3.30 service in either direction five times or more in a week and they qualify for a half - price discount			2
so how many regular users does the thing have ? precisely none			0
or to put it in @entity59 terms : cripes ! so much for mr mayor ’s boast that his ten - seater fibreglass bubbles over the @entity18 have been ‘ a howling success ’ , bringing ‘ new jobs , homes and enterprise ’ to ‘ a vibrant new metropolitan quarter ’			1
this scheme is more like his other attempt at suspended travel when he set off down that @entity2 zip wire in 2012 — and famously got stuck			1
it is just that they do not travel in ‘ conventional ’ ways			1
i might be more inclined to swallow this pr spiel if i was n’t immediately ordered off the premises and told i need a special permit to talk to the public			2
so i stand at the station perimeter and talk to people there			0
and they all still seem to be tourists			0
to be fair , the cable car has had precious little commuter traffic ever since it opened in 2012			0
during its first year , the number of regular users was found to be 16			2
last year , that had fallen to four			2
now , they would appear to be extinct			0
since its grand opening two years ago , the total number of commuters using the panoramic @entity38 to travel to work appears to have fallen to an all - time low — of none at all @entity85 ’s head of the @entity38 , @entity111 , tells me the figures are misleading because regular users tend to buy a book of discounted tickets , which they can use any time , rather than pay with their oyster cards			1
but even he says that regulars comprise just 3 per cent of his customers			0
@entity119 , the local blogger who submitted the @entity33 request , says the number is a single round figure : nought			2
whether the true answer is ‘ a handful ’ or zero , the question remains the same : why on earth was this white elephant — connecting two not very interesting places — built in the first place ? spanning the @entity18 between the @entity78 — the old @entity131 — on the southern bank and the @entity80 with its @entity133 to the north , the idea was to carry up to 2,500 people an hour			1
questions : why on earth was this white elephant - connecting two not very interesting places - built in the first place ? a third were expected to be regular commuters , a third were expected to be visitors travelling between events on either side of the river and the remaining third would simply be enjoying the ride			1
it would play a modest role during the 2012 games since it connected two @entity2 sites ( but this was useful only if you happened to have tickets for both )			0
as it turns out , the vast majority of passengers ( 70 per cent , according to @entity85 ’s surveys ; 95 per cent , according to mine ) are simply here for fun			0
in other words , it ’s a theme park ride			0
but it is hardly the role of our transport authorities to build funfair attractions			2
the £ 60 million construction cost was met by £ 36 million in sponsorship from @entity170 , £ 8 million from an @entity172 regional slush fund and £ 16 million from the taxpayer			0
while the former mayor , @entity174 , predicted that the project would be a ‘ disaster ’ , @entity15 was delighted to have another eye - catching wheeze to go with his ‘ @entity15 ’ rent - a - bikes and his hop on / hop off buses			1
‘ get on this immediately ! ’ he proclaimed at the end of his inaugural flight			1
it would be wrong to say that this spectacular ride , dangling nearly 300 ft over the @entity18 for the best part of ten minutes , is unpopular			1
each week , thousands of tourists make the round trip , so much so that @entity85 insist the cable car is paying its way and enjoys exemplary ‘ customer satisfaction ’ scores			1
sitting up here , even on a grey and windy afternoon , i can see why			0
as a visitor attraction , it is not unlike the @entity197 , the capital ’s big wheel near @entity200			0
this cable car might not overlook @entity203 and @entity204 , but it commands an impressive view of the gritty end of @entity16 , it ’s only a fraction of the price of the £ 29.50 - a - time wheel and you certainly do n’t need to book in advance			1
taking off from the south side , i get a cracking view of the @entity213 , liberated from state control and reborn as a concert venue			0
to the east , the mighty vaulted sluices of the @entity217 are faintly reminiscent of the @entity219			0
the skyscrapers of @entity221 blot out much of the broader @entity16 landscape but i can see @entity223 in one direction and the @entity225 in the other			1
what is striking is how much old - fashioned industry is still here in the @entity231 , much of it unchanged since @entity233 it dawns on me that the last time people routinely flew this low over places such as @entity238 and @entity239 , they were in @entity241 uniform			1
we come in to land at @entity80 and it ’s not terribly inviting			0
there are a few lifeless apartment blocks , a couple of coffee shops , a halal burger van and a @entity251			0
the excel exhibition centre is a five - minute walk away , but there ’s nothing on there today			2
most cable car passengers stay on board and go straight back to @entity259			0
among those i do find wandering around are the @entity263 family from @entity223			0
despite living nearby , they had never used the cable car until today			0
‘ it ’s been on our to do list for a long time and now we ’ve done it , ’ says @entity266			1
but they can not see the point of an aerial link between two places already connected by the tube ( and it ’s only a couple of stops )			0
@entity85 insists the cable car carries 1.5 million paying customers each year and this figure will increase as the area is developed			0
‘ it ’s great to have something that gives the area an identity , ’ says @entity111 , adding that it is the first project in @entity85 history to attract complaints for being too quick			1
‘ when we started , it took five minutes to get across and people complained it was n’t long enough			2
’ now , it ’s a five - minute ride before 9am and ten minutes thereafter			1
former mayor of london @entity174 , pictured , predicted the project would be a ‘ disaster ’ but even if it does manage to repay the £ 16 million spent by the taxpayer , should the state be wasting time on this sort of vanity project ? and does it really deserve to be on the world - famous @entity29 map with its very own livery ? i suppose it makes a good pub quiz question : which @entity29 line is marked in red and white ? answer : the @entity38			1
as dusk falls , i search for a phantom commuter in the evening rush hour			0
finally , a lone figure alights purposefully with a walking stick at @entity259			0
i ’m your man , ’ laughs @entity318 , 60			2
‘ i ’ve been using this every day since it opened to get to work and i think it ’s fantastic			1
’ the disabled father of three gets a mini-cab from his home in @entity327 , @entity16 , to the cable car , uses a discounted book of tickets rather than an oyster card to fly over the @entity18 and then picks up a minicab on the other side to his office in @entity335 , @entity336			1
‘ it ’s hard to get a seat on the @entity29 and the cable car has step - free access			1
my brother calls it the best - kept secret in @entity16			1
’ perhaps its day will come			2
perhaps , like its neighbour , the old @entity131 , the @entity38 will evolve from a national joke into a national treasure			2
perhaps @entity85 will eventually uproot it and put it somewhere genuinely useful			0
in the meantime , just sit back and enjoy the peace , the view and the emptiness on @entity15 ’s @entity231 ghost train .			0

according to @entity16 's mayor , the trans - @entity18 shuttle is ‘ much - needed ’
but the total number of commuters using the panoramic @entity38 to travel to work appears to have fallen to an all - time low — of none at all
it 's arguably the most pointless piece of public transport in the country
