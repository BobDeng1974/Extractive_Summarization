most of the @entity10 had already announced rise of more than £ 100 this winter , before ministers moved to reduce the impact of government schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable insulate their homes			1
now @entity19 has said it will cut bills by £ 53 in january , @entity18 bills will fall by £ 50 , while @entity21 said it would hold prices until 2015 , but ministers admitted prices could still rise again			1
checking the bill : details of handouts of up to £ 1,000 for homeowners to spend on energy - saving measures have been revealed ( file picture ) chancellor @entity31 has sealed a deal which will see the taxpayer shoulder the cost of some schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable insulate their homes			2
ministers stress that they have never promised to cut bills overall , insisting they can only act to reduce the costs of government policy			1
the taxpayer is to pick up part of the cost of environmental programmes in a package of measures to be unveiled by the chancellor in thursday 's @entity48 statement			2
they again dismissed @entity51 's promise to freeze bills as a ' con ' because it is impossible to control global energy prices			1
the government is cutting the cost of the energy company obligation ( @entity59 ) , an insulation scheme delivered by major energy suppliers , in a move that should shave £ 30 - £ 35 off bills , on average , next year			1
the @entity64 also announced it is establishing a rebate , saving the average customer £ 12 on their bill for the next two years			2
electricity companies will also take voluntary action to reduce network costs in 2014 - 15 , funding a one - off reduction of around £ 5 on electricity bills			1
in addition , energy firms will be given two years longer to hit targets on the insulation of homes , enabling costs to consumers to be spread out			2
@entity19 winter 2013 price rise : 10 per cent , adding £ 131 on average standard dual fuel tariff new cut : £ 53 , in january 2014 @entity84 winter 2013 price rise : 10 per cent , adding £ 139 on average standard dual fuel tariff new cut : is calculating size of cut			1
promises a freeze in prices until spring 2015 , provided wholesale energy costs or network charges do not rise @entity18 winter 2013 price rise : 8 per cent , adding £ 106 on average standard dual fuel tariff new cut : 4 per cent cut for average dual - fuel customer , saving around £ 50 , coming into effect by the end of march @entity21 winter 2013 price rise : 4 per cent , adding £ 52 on average standard dual fuel tariff new cut : says it took into account the prospect of cuts in green levies when it set a lower price rise @entity104 winter 2013 price rise : 8 per cent , adding £ 112 on average standard dual fuel tariff new cut : yet to announce details @entity106 winter 2013 price rise : did not announce a price rise at the same time as the other @entity10 energy secretary @entity110 said : ' consumers are the ones who are winning today with an average of £ 50 off household energy bills , we ’ve managed to do that by protecting the fuel poor … and we ’ve done that by maintaining our green energy policies			1
' he told @entity121 's today programme : ' one thing i think people have missed a bit is our very fierce competition policies			2
' we ’ve been working with @entity127 to increase competition in the retail sector			0
which is why we ’ve seen a lot of new firms come to supply energy			0
' @entity51 reduced the number of firms in their time – @entity136 and @entity51 reduced the number of firms and created the @entity10			0
' the @entity10 are @entity51 ’s creation			0
under the @entity138 we ’ve seen a whole group of new people coming in to compete and winning customers off the @entity10			0
' the @entity10 may not like that , but this government is in favour of competition			0
' but he later admitted that if wholesale prices rise , costs to customers will go up again			1
' as the major energy companies have now confirmed there will be no need for price rises in 2014 unless of course there is a major change in wholesale or network costs , ' he told @entity158			1
today the firms gave details of how the savings would be passed on			0
@entity84 said it would reduce its bills and is calculating what the saving will mean for customers			1
@entity19 put up electricity prices by 10.4 per cent and gas by 8.4 per cent two weeks ago			1
but today it said it would roll back some of those rises , cutting the average dual - fuel bill by £ 43 and reducing the @entity172 scheme by £ 12			1
managing director @entity173 said : ' @entity19 is pleased to be cutting energy bills by an average of £ 53 from january 1			1
' we 've been able to do this because the government has committed to making changes to the environmental and social obligations that are paid for through energy bills			2
these changes will now allow us to help more people at a lower cost			0
' @entity84 said it would pass on the savings , and promised not to push up prices again before spring 2015			1
@entity188 , ceo at @entity84 , said : ' as a result of this announcement we will reduce our bills			1
' we are currently calculating how large this reduction will be , and can assure our customers that it will fully reflect the reduction in the costs to our business			2
' in addition , in order to give our customers greater certainty with their household budgets , we do n't plan to increase energy prices before spring 2015 , unless there are increases in wholesale energy costs or network charges			1
' @entity18 said it expects a saving for the typical dual - fuel customer of around 4 per cent before the end of march , equivalent to a saving of around £ 50 for a typical dual - fuel customer			1
@entity21 said its ‘ decision to hold back the full impact of rising costs ’ earlier this month by implementing lower rise than competitors had been ‘ validated by the conformation that the government will take action on energy changes ’			1
‘ customers should expect other energy suppliers to follow @entity21 ’s lead by significantly lowering their prices , ’ he said			0
preview : ahead of his @entity227 this week , chancellor @entity31 gave details of reforms which he said would see £ 50 shaved off energy bills ministers have been scrambling to find a way to deal with rising energy costs since @entity51 leader @entity136 promised to freeze bills for two years if he wins the 2015 election			1
@entity236 dismissed the plan as a ' con ' but action to reduce the cost of gas and electricity proved popular with voters			0
the government focussed on the impact of government policy , in particular to green levies which are added to bills used to fund schemes to make homes more energy efficient			0
ministers hailed today 's deal as a ' serious , workable package which would save households around £ 50 on average '			1
but @entity51 's shadow energy secretary @entity257 said : ' if @entity236 and @entity258 think just doing what the energy companies ask of them is the answer to bills being too high they are wrong			2
' energy bills have gone up by £ 120 this winter alone , so even with a £ 50 cut in levies , people ’s bills will still be higher this winter than last year			1
' the real reason bills are rising year on year without justification is because the energy market is broken			2
instead of bailing out the energy companies , @entity236 should stand up to them and stop them overcharging people			0
' energy secretary @entity110 said the plan was a ' serious , workable package ' but @entity51 's @entity257 said bills would still be higher than last winter mr @entity31 yesterday said he was certain that the average £ 50 saving from slashing the @entity282 would be passed on by energy firms to consumers			1
he said : ‘ this will help families			0
we ’ve been in discussions with the energy companies			0
we are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in			0
’ asked how £ 1,000 grants for homebuyers to improve energy efficiency and cuts to environmental levies on bills would be funded , mr @entity31 replied : ‘ the money will come from additional taxes that we will raise from dealing with tax avoidance			2
’ he refused to give details of the tax avoidance crackdown but said people were wrong to be sceptical about whether such action really raised revenue			0
‘ this government has taken step after step and the amount of tax we collect from people who were previously avoiding their tax goes up by billions of pounds over this parliament , ’ he said			0
the chancellor attacked @entity51 ’s pledge of a 20 - month freeze on energy prices if they win the election - which has been dominating the political agenda since @entity136 announced it in september			2
