new dna technology could help reveal the killer in an unsolved murder of a mother and her three - year - old daughter			2
the technique , known as @entity6 , can generate a digital mugshot of the suspect by using samples such as blood and strands of hair left at the scene			1
investigators in @entity15 have used the analysis , generated by @entity17 , in a bid to get a breakthrough in the slaying of @entity21 , 25 , and her toddler @entity22 four years ago			1
their bodies were found in the busy @entity25 in @entity26 on january 9 , 2011			2
unsolved : investigators in @entity15 are hoping the dna technique called snapshot , generated by @entity17 , leads to a breakthrough in the slaying of @entity22 , three , and @entity21 four years ago			1
there were no witnesses to their deaths in january 2011 leads : there were no signs of forced entry at their home and police believe the toddler and her mother may have known the killer			2
more than 200 people have been interviewed in connection to their deaths police have never revealed how they died and would only confirm it was by different means			0
there were no signs of forced entry - leading detectives to believe they knew the killer or killers			0
the only piece of evidence left at the scene was an unspecified dna sample that has , until now , been untraceable			1
as there were no witnesses , authorities turned to the forensic phenotyping and found the suspect was dark - skinned with brown hair and brown eyes			1
however the computer - generated image does not have an estimated height or age - traits which the company claim are ' very complex '			0
speaking to @entity69 , @entity17 's director of bioinformatics , @entity70 , said : ' this is particularly useful when there are no witnesses , no hits in the dna database and nothing to go on			0
prediction : using the phenotyping technique , investigators have been able to determine that the suspect is dark - skinned with brown eyes and brown hair ' traditional forensic analysis treats dna as a fingerprint , whereas @entity6 treats it as a blueprint -- a genetic description of a person from which physical appearance can be inferred			1
' traits are generally predicted with more than 80 percent confidence , and importantly , @entity6 also reports which phenotypes can be excluded with more than 95 per cent confidence			0
' @entity95 , a cold case investigator with the @entity26 police department , said that more than 200 people were interviewed in connection with the mother and daughter 's death			0
around 150 of them submitted their dna - but none matched the sample left at the scene .			0

technique known as @entity6 can *create* a digital mugshot using samples
traits such as skin and hair color can be predicted using hair and blood
could lead to breakthrough in case of @entity21 and @entity22
bodies were found in their @entity15 *apartment* in january 2011
only piece of evidence found was an unspecified dna sample
using the technology , authorities have been able to determine suspect was dark - skinned with brown eyes and brown hair
