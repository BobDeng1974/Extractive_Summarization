by @entity0 last updated at 12:00 am on 14th september 2011 deputy prime minister @entity1 is set to see the disappearance of his constituency @entity4 but he may have the last laugh as the net result could be two new @entity8 seats in the city @entity8 yesterday threatened to vote down plans to reduce the number of @entity12 , as it was revealed the changes could mean several of the party 's highest - profile ministers lose their seats			1
around a quarter of @entity8 are affected by the redrawn constituency borders revealed by the @entity19 yesterday , compared with one in ten @entity12 and a handful of @entity21			1
@entity8 party president @entity22 , transport minister @entity23 and energy secretary @entity24 will all see their seats carved up or merged with others			2
@entity28 dem business secretary @entity27 – whose seat is also at risk in the shake - up – took aim at the proposals yesterday , even though his party had vowed to support them as part of the @entity38 deal			1
lord @entity39 , the party ’s constitutional affairs spokesman in the @entity42 , has indicated that @entity8 will try to vote down the plans when they come to @entity44 in 2013 following a two - year consultation			2
the government wants to cut the number of mps from 650 to 600 and ensure constituencies have a similar number of voters – around 76,000 – so that everyone ’s vote counts equally			1
despite @entity21 backing for the moves , @entity53 also faces a serious rebellion in his ranks from mps who think the changes have been deliberately botched by the @entity19 to punish them for demanding such a radical shake - up			1
mps inundated their whips with complaints yesterday , warning they too may vote down the proposals			2
meanwhile @entity65 sources vowed to capitalise on the @entity8 discontent and deliver a defeat to the government			1
senior party figures including shadow chancellor @entity70 , his wife , shadow home secretary @entity72 , and @entity74 spokesman @entity73 will all see their seats disappear			1
sources close to @entity1 made clear that the deputy prime minister expects his @entity8 mps to vote for the changes , pointing out that the party ’s election manifesto called for a reduction of 150 mps in the @entity83			1
the source said : ‘ there will be mps of all sides who do not like the @entity19 ’s conclusions			2
they have two years to make their case to the @entity19			2
but these plans are in the @entity38 agreement			2
‘ we have more to lose than the @entity21 if we go around suggesting that things in the @entity38 agreement are negotiable			1
’ but dr cable took a markedly different line yesterday , saying : ‘ in order to get the right size of constituency , no account has been taken not just of borough boundaries , but any sense of identity			1
that will cause a lot of concern			2
’ the plans will see dr cable ’s @entity109 seat making way for a new @entity113 and @entity109 constituency spanning the @entity114 could force him into a face - off for the new seat with high - profile @entity21 @entity118 , the mp for @entity113			1
senior @entity21 reacted with fury to the @entity8 complaints , pointing out that the party vowed to support the plans in exchange for holding last may ’s referendum on the @entity125			1
mr @entity1 , as forecast could see his @entity4 seat ( current boundaries above ) abolished and replaced with a new seat , @entity131 and @entity132 ( below ) losers : the most prominent @entity21 casualty is @entity135 in @entity136 , represented by chancellor @entity137 , left , and in the @entity65 ranks , shadow chancellor @entity70 will see his @entity139 and @entity140 seat condemned			1
other senior figures facing serious disruption or disappearance of their seats are cabinet ministers @entity145 , far right , and @entity24 , second right			0
@entity147 and @entity27 will also be affected @entity148 electorates 1			0
@entity149 ( @entity150 ) - 109,902 2			0
@entity151 ( @entity65 ) - 90,674 3			0
@entity152 ( @entity65 ) - 90,110 4			0
@entity153 ( @entity150 ) - 88,851 5			0
@entity154 ( @entity65 ) - @entity155			0
@entity156 ( @entity157 ) - 21,7802			0
@entity158 and @entity159 ( @entity8 ) - 33,0853			0
@entity161 ( @entity160 ) - 41,1984			0
@entity162 ( con ) - 44,5935			0
@entity163 ( @entity160 ) - 45,364 cabinet office minister @entity164 told the @entity165 : ‘ it would be unprecedented for this to be voted down			0
' the legislation that set up this completely independent process was voted through @entity44			0
' it would be eccentric indeed to reject the results			0
’ justice secretary @entity145 , whose @entity173 seat will disappear , backed the plans			1
he said : ‘ at the moment your vote is far more important if you live in one of those places with small constituencies rather than one of those with big constituencies			0
' it ’s not really democratic			0
’ the prime minister ’s official spokesman added : ‘ it is for the boundary commissioners to decide where the constituency boundaries are drawn			1
’ but one @entity65 official said : ‘ it ’s just a series of ludicrous lines on a map			0
' if @entity65 votes against these measures you would only need around 30 @entity8 and a dozen @entity21 to rebel and the government has a problem			1
’ a boundary change which would ' move ' historic @entity201 into the rural @entity203 parliamentary constituency was condemned as ' madness ' today			1
the @entity19 wants to take the @entity206 ward of @entity207 out of the city constituency and include it in the @entity203 to balance up the electorate when the number of @entity12 is reduced			1
it would mean not just the 900 - year - old cathedral but also @entity207 docks - the @entity215 's most inland port - becoming part of the @entity217 constituency			1
@entity207 's @entity21 mp @entity218 said today : ' it 's absolutely barking			1
to remove the @entity206 ward from the city of @entity207 would be like @entity222 without the prince			0
' @entity227 's former @entity226 seat ( above ) could be snatched by the @entity21 under proposals for a new look @entity230 and @entity232 seat ( below ) , which will take in chunks of the current @entity235 seat , including @entity236 and @entity237 , as well as @entity232 1			1
why is the review being carried out ? the government wants to make sure all constituencies have the same number of voters			1
at the moment people 's votes can carry more or less weight depending on where they live 2			2
how are the boundaries worked out ? first the electoral quota is calculated			0
this is the number of registered electors in the @entity215 divided by the number of constituencies			2
the current electoral quota is 76,641			0
every constituency in @entity255 – except two covering the @entity149 – must have a number of registered electors within 5 per cent of this figure			1
using this quota , the @entity19 allocates the specified number of constituencies among the nine regions of @entity255 3			2
can you comment on the proposals ? yes			0
all responses will be considered before the @entity19 decides whether to publish revised proposals later in 2012 , before making final recommendations to the secretary of state by 1 october 2013			0
will my mp or constituency be affected by the boundary changes ? the new rules mean that there must be 600 constituencies in the @entity215 , as opposed to 650 previously			2
this means the number of constituencies in @entity255 will be reduced by 31 , from 533 to 502			2
both of these factors mean that there will be some changes to the majority of the existing constituencies			0
will the boundary changes have an impact on my council tax , local services or insurance premiums ? no. the boundary changes only relate to parliamentary constituencies .			0

government wants to even out number of voters in each constituency
@entity1 , @entity137 and @entity70 are *key* casualties
@entity227 's old seat could become winnable @entity21 target
