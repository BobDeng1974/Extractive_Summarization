@entity0 has lambasted the @entity2 regimes of recent years and insisted they should be ‘ ashamed ’ of the damage inflicted on the club			1
the interim chairman spoke out as @entity6 announced they had accepted a £ 1.5million loan from the @entity10 consortium — cutting off any prospect of drawing down a second £ 5m advance from @entity15 ’s @entity14 firm			1
@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are lending the money without any security , interest or fees			2
@entity0 is angry at decisions made by previous board at @entity6 the new @entity2 board say they will use the cash to keep the club functioning while they finalise a ‘ medium to long - term ’ funding package for their rebuilding plans			1
@entity32 is expected to play a significant financial role at that point , having temporarily stepped back as he seeks to prove to the @entity35 that he should be deemed ‘ fit and proper ’ to become chairman			2
@entity0 is filling the role for now and — in conjunction with fellow directors @entity16 , @entity40 and @entity41 — has been analysing the various contracts inherited after taking control on march 6			1
he has now castigated decisions taken by the former board — which comprised @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 — and those who preceded them in the wake of @entity54 ’s ruinous reign			0
‘ many of the people who have occupied the @entity2 boardroom during that period should be ashamed of themselves for the parts they played in dragging this great institution towards near financial ruin , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity32 ( right ) is expected to play a significant financial role at @entity6 ‘ it is actually difficult to look closely at the club ’s finances and understand the rationale behind some of the decisions taken			0
‘ let me give just two examples of the recklessness displayed by those who were removed from office just more than two weeks ago			0
‘ one is the amount — in the region of £ 300,000 — spent on a needless general meeting and the other is the signing of five @entity80 loan players without medicals			2
’ manager @entity83 confirmed last week that at least two of the five imports from @entity86 were unlikely ever to play for @entity6			0
@entity0 thanked the ‘ commitment ’ shown by the @entity10 and said the board hoped to unveil their next financial step ‘ in the coming weeks ’			1
@entity32 has previously estimated he would put forward approximately 50 per cent of the funds required to restore @entity6			0
@entity83 claimed his first win as @entity6 boss at the weekend addressing investment by the @entity95 - based businessman , @entity0 added : ‘ he is not doing so at the moment because , as we have said , we respect the processes of the @entity35 and must wait until they have completed their review of @entity32 ’s status before he can fully participate in the future of the club			2
‘ after that , we will be inviting him to invest alongside the gentlemen who have just provided today ’s facility and others who are also willing to invest			0
‘ we can and we will rebuild the club and this £ 1.5m investment is stage one of the process			1
’ the previous board agreed a two - stage £ 10m loan from @entity14 , which gained 75 per cent of the club ’s retail operation and various securities in return			2
‘ we have already made it clear we are happy to engage with @entity14 but the board has decided against drawing down the second £ 5m tranche of @entity14 ’s £ 10m loan , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we are still in the process of reviewing all of the contractual relationships that @entity14 has with the club			0
’ meanwhile , @entity126 assistant boss @entity125 has told the @entity6 board that @entity83 is the right man to be their long - term manager			0
‘ i suspect they will find they have a fantastic character in @entity83 and will make him the permanent manager , ’ he said .			0
