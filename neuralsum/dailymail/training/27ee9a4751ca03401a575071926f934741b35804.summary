blow for @entity0 : judges ruled a crackdown on legal aid for immigrants was ' unlawful ' judges have inflicted a humiliating blow on justice secretary @entity0 after ruling a crackdown on legal aid for immigrants was ‘ unlawful ’			1
the @entity8 said guidelines determining whether public money should be given to people threatened with deportation so they could fight the case were ‘ too restrictive ’			1
the guidance was wrong because it demanded a ‘ very high threshold ’ for handing out legal aid when someone was facing being thrown out of @entity16 and said funding should only be granted in cases which were ‘ rare and extreme ’			1
@entity20 , the @entity21 , yesterday upheld a @entity23 decision that the rules were ‘ unlawful ’			1
the @entity25 must now redraft the guidelines and reassess funding for some immigrants , including @entity29 , a 28 - year - old @entity30 national who has committed a ‘ considerable number ’ of crimes			1
the ruling is another blow to mr @entity0 who earlier this month was told a ban on sending books to inmates in jail was unlawful			0
and last week a paedophile and a dangerous armed robber were controversially awarded hundreds of pounds in compensation because delays in the prison system breached their human rights			0
the case centres on guidelines about exceptional funding , which sets out who is still eligible to apply for legal aid in certain immigration cases following the government 's legal aid cuts			1
ruling : the master of the @entity55 has upheld a decision by the @entity23 ( above ) that the rules were ' unlawful ' the scheme was intended to act as a ‘ safety net ’ but @entity20 , sitting with @entity60 and @entity61 , said the @entity25 had ordered it be applied too stringently			1
he said : ‘ it correctly identifies many of the factors that should be taken into account in deciding whether to grant exceptional funding , but it neutralises their effect by wrongly stating that the threshold for funding is very high and that legal aid is required only in rare and extreme cases			1
’ the appeal court considered five cases of immigrants who had been refused legal aid under the scheme			1
the @entity25 lost on three cases , which means the claimants must be reassessed for funding			2
he has been jailed several times , including for stealing a car and crashing it during a high - speed chase while trying to flee police			0
mr @entity0 introduced the crackdown on legal aid in a bid to trim the bill by £ 350million a year by 2015			2
work to do : the @entity25 must now redraft the guidelines and reassess funding for some immigrants			1
the @entity25 's offices near @entity92 in central @entity93 are pictured there were wide - ranging changes to the provision and scope of legal aid , including for immigration cases			1
immigrants could apply for ‘ exceptional case funding ’ to secure legal aid but this should be withheld unless it would make challenging a deportation ruling ‘ practically impossible ’			1
previous warning : shadow justice minister @entity106 ( pictured ) said the government 's legal aid cuts were ' rushed through before preparing the necessary evidence to justify them ' in 2013 - 14 , there were 235 applications for legal aid funding in immigration cases and only four were granted – suggesting the bar was set too high , said critics			2
shadow justice minister @entity106 said : ‘ the government 's legal aid cuts were rushed through before preparing the necessary evidence to justify them			2
‘ @entity120 , alongside most of the legal profession , warned that this would raise substantial barriers to access to justice			0
@entity124 should listen and fix the mess he has created			0
’ @entity126 , chairman of the @entity127 , said : ‘ people who are refused legal are being denied access to justice			0
‘ if , as is so often the case , they are unable to present their own case effectively , then it is simply not heard and the courts can not do their job			0
this is a breach of their human rights			0
‘ the government must urgently improve access to justice for these people , who are among the most vulnerable in society			0
’ the @entity25 said it would ‘ carefully consider ’ its next steps following the ruling			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we continue to believe that the exceptional funding scheme is functioning as intended			0
its purpose is to provide funding where it is legally needed			0
‘ legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but resources are not limitless and must be properly targeted at the cases that need it most			2
‘ the system must be sustainable and fair for those who use it and the taxpayers who pay for it			0
