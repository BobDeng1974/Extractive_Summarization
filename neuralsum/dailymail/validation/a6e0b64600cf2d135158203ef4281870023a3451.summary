@entity1 's @entity0 has been criticised by his manager @entity2 , who feels the midfielder should be ' embarrassed ' about diving in saturday 's 2 - 1 win at @entity6			1
@entity0 was booked early in the second half of the @entity9 clash at the @entity10 for simulation having taken a tumble in the box			1
and @entity2 told @entity15 ' goals on sunday programme : ' he dived			1
' he should be embarrassed			0
he 's a great professional and that 's unlike him			0
i was surprised but it shows what pressure does to players			0
@entity1 midfielder @entity0 ( left ) was booked for diving in the second - half against @entity6 @entity2 told @entity15 ' goals on sunday programme that @entity24 should feel ' embarrassed ' ' i have n't spoken to him about it but i do n't need to			1
he will see the replay and he will be embarrassed			0
' the win continued @entity1 's resurgence under @entity2 , who took over in january after leaving @entity29			1
having been in the relegation zone at that point , the @entity1 are now 11 points clear of it and up to 11th place - one spot above @entity29			1
@entity2 had a rocky relationship with the @entity38 club 's fans and when his @entity29 side were beaten 1 - 0 at @entity6 in september , several of the away supporters held up signs calling for him to be sacked			1
however , following a much happier return to the @entity43 for the 53 - year - old on saturday , he insisted it was of no real significance to him that @entity1 had leapfrogged @entity29 in the table			1
and @entity2 also indicated he is not about to take anything for granted in terms of survival			2
@entity1 - with 19 points from 10 league games under @entity2 so far - have a total of 36 , and he said : ' i 'm still thinking about another couple of points			1
@entity6 forward @entity57 ( left ) hassles @entity1 's @entity58 ( right ) for the ball on saturday palace winger @entity60 ( right ) celebrates scoring his side 's second goal with team - mate @entity63 ' but nine wins ( for @entity1 in the league over the season ) going into this international break - i would have absolutely jumped at that when i arrived			1
' asked if there was any significance for him to going above @entity29 , @entity2 said : ' no , not really			2
' the most important thing for me is that this club is within touching distance of @entity9 status for next year			2
' that is the only agenda i had when i arrived			0
we have done absolutely brilliantly			0
' it ( his previous visit to @entity6 ) was a difficult night , and i 've had them as a manager			2
you have to show your mettle			0
' but it was a different feeling on saturday because we are in great form			0
you want to have more of those in your career , and hopefully i can as i continue with @entity1			2
' @entity6 midfielder @entity88 ( left ) dribbles the ball away from @entity1 's @entity90 ( right ) @entity6 , 10th on 42 points , are looking this season to better their @entity9 records set last term of a ninth - placed finish and 50 - point total			1
saturday 's result made it back - to - back defeats and manager @entity100 is keen for an impressive campaign not to fizzle out			0
he did , though , stress he thought the @entity103 ' performance against @entity1 had been an improvement on the previous weekend 's loss to @entity106			2
' i thought performance-wise it was a marked difference from last week , which was pleasing , but we have n't got a positive result , ' @entity100 said			0
' we are disappointed - we made mistakes , so maybe we did n't do enough to win			0
' but we certainly deserved to take something out of it			0
' @entity1 have climbed to 11th in the @entity9 table since @entity2 took over at the club in january			1
