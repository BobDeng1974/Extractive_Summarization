@entity0 has turned the @entity2 ’ @entity1 into a one - man show			1
the @entity5 trainer would have won it with @entity7 had she not stumbled at the final fence and thrown off @entity9 but still ended up lifting the prize with stablemate @entity11			1
that makes it seven wins running , @entity0 having lifted the prize for the last six seasons with another record - breaker in @entity18 before she retired to stud			1
@entity11 capitalises on @entity7 's fall to win the @entity21 ’ @entity22 it will be a shame if @entity0 ’ total domination of day one overshadows the first @entity27 win of trainer @entity29 courtesy of @entity30 in the @entity31			1
@entity29 , who runs @entity32 in this afternoon ’s @entity33 , is a trainer going places and now has the @entity35 in his sights for @entity37 , who won under @entity38			2
there was no redemption for last year ’s unlucky @entity22 third @entity42 , who could only manage fifth this time around			0
jockey @entity44 was adamant that his mount was not himself , describing the feel he gave him as ‘ not like him ’			0
his father trainer @entity49 will begin a retrieval mission next week but i wonder if tuesday ’s run means @entity42 will be over fences next season			0
jockey @entity44 ( above ) was adamant that his mount @entity42 was not himself @entity5 trainer @entity55 is more established than @entity29 but his efforts in plotting a route back to the @entity27 with his @entity59 winner @entity60 also deserves praise			1
the gelding was second at the meeting last year and had run only three times since with his novice status preserved			0
@entity55 also set up a 64th birthday winner for owner @entity67			0
the final race of day one now has the less than snappy name of the @entity70 ’ @entity31			2
quite a mouthful but @entity72 trainer @entity71 is hoping that might work in her favour after @entity75 won for owner @entity76 and gave jockey @entity77 his second win of the day			2
admitting she had never visited the island , @entity79 said : ‘ maybe @entity76 will take me there now			0

@entity11 makes it seven wins running in @entity2 ’ @entity1
