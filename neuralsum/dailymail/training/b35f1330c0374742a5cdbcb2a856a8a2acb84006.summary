@entity1 was responsible for one of his biggest wins back in 2006 , now that same company threatens to bring him down @entity6 is accused of using an account reserved for port operations to fund his election campaign the @entity11 government faces allegations of owing @entity6 $ 500 million the maverick mp once told the @entity14 that @entity15 was not treating @entity11 with ' dignity ' upset potential @entity11 partners by naming the wrong company and trumpeting a $ 60bn deal before it was signed he set up the @entity21 with a view to improving his standing in @entity24 by @entity25 it 's a love - hate relationship , years in the making			1
@entity6 , 60 , has a long and successful history with @entity11 and , more particularly , @entity1			1
he was already a very wealthy individual on the back of real estate investments in 2006 when the @entity11 company helped him land a $ 415 million deal in @entity15 's @entity33			1
now , eight years on , that connection has gone full circle with the now mp for the federal seat of @entity38 locked in a bitter legal battle with the company			2
@entity1 insists that account was to be used only for covering the operational costs of @entity54 , an iron ore port in @entity15			1
the allegations centre on two cheques			0
one , which @entity11 officials say , was drawn from this account in 2013 for $ 10 million which reportedly went to mr @entity6 's @entity61 and a $ 2.17 million amount which was received by pr firm @entity63			1
in short , @entity1 has accused mr @entity6 of using the $ 12 million to fund his federal election campaign			1
that battle for the seat of @entity38 he won by a mere seven votes , necessitating a recount before his position in the @entity70 was ratified			0
@entity6 has been accused of using funds from an account for port operations for his election campaign before this fallout , it was , on paper at least , the perfect marriage			1
@entity6 the mining magnate seeking to shore up a long - term business connection with the biggest market in @entity24 and the @entity11 happy to tap into his hold on @entity15 's natural resources			1
and such was his commitment to @entity11 , with @entity15 's footballing fraternity extending into the region , mr @entity6 saw opportunity there too when he bought the @entity21 soccer club to help improve his profile in @entity11			1
remarkably , in order to keep costs down and avoid attendance related fines from the @entity94 , he ordered a cap on 5000 on home games for the club			0
long before he labelled the @entity11 ' mongrels and bastards ' , he was regaling the @entity100 about the benefits of working with @entity11 and , in fact accused @entity104 politicians , including then pm @entity105 , of not treating them with dignity			1
@entity6 and @entity107 of @entity11 celebrate the @entity11 first mining venture in 2009 that was in 2009 when he insisted the @entity112 government 's trade policies made trade more difficult for @entity11 investors than @entity116 investors			1
in an address to the @entity118 he called the policies ' racist ' and said there was ' a great cry in @entity15 about @entity122 under the bed '			2
mr @entity6 then argued that ' capital is now in @entity11 , it 's not in the @entity116 ' and that @entity15 had a terrific opportunity to become a strong trade partner with @entity11 ' if our politicians could only be fair and treat the @entity11 people and @entity11 government with the dignity they deserve			1
' ' why should the average @entity116 , regardless of his education or qualifications , have the right to invest $ 950 million in @entity15 but the ­ average @entity11 , regardless of how much money he has , is not allowed to invest without our treasurer saying so ? ' that pronouncement landed as mr @entity6 's @entity139 and @entity140 of @entity11 were granted major project status by the @entity142 for the ' @entity143 ' , a $ 7.5 billion thermal coal mine in @entity145			1
it has n't been all plain sailing though , as evidenced when @entity6 saw the opportunity to parlay the @entity15 success in his home state of @entity145 , even further			1
one of the mining projects in the @entity33 which helped build @entity6 's fortune the billionaire has hopes of replicating his @entity15 mining success back home in @entity145 but in early 2010 , as he was trumpeting the success of a $ 60 billion 20 - year deal with the help of the @entity162 @entity161 , no less , the wheels started to come off			1
mr @entity6 's gaffe in naming the wrong company was seen as a little more than a bump in the road but then doubts began to surface , first from the vice-president of @entity169 , suggesting it was far from a done deal			1
doubts which turned to denials by the boss , @entity174 , who also happened to be the daughter of @entity11 's then premier , @entity176			2
but the larger than life entrepreneur turned politician would not be denied			0
late last year he had cause for double celebration - winning a spot in parliament along with the final approval for the massive ' @entity143 ' project in the @entity184 - which could potentially produce up to 40 million tonnes a year			0
the ebb and flow of his business dealings took its next twist when @entity1 launched its legal action over the @entity190			2
@entity192 senator @entity191 ( left ) says he was n't concerned at or offended by @entity6 's comments , telling reporters ' i know he did n't mean that ' one of mr @entity6 's companies , @entity197 , put $ 12.7 million back into the account after media accounts of the incident first emerged			1
he has countered , claiming to be owed $ 500 million in royalties by ' the communist @entity11 government '			1
on monday night , while pressed on the legal action , he launched into a tirade about @entity11 business interests in @entity15 , accusing @entity11 people of trying to take over @entity15			2
' i 'm saying that because they 're communist , they shoot their own people , they have n't got a justice system and they want to take over this country			0
and we 're not going to let them do it			0
' @entity6 on monday night ' the @entity11 government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free			1
so far they 've shifted $ 200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it			0
i do n't mind standing up against the @entity11 bastards and stop them from doing it , ' he said			2
he went on to add : ' i ’m saying that because they ’re communist , they shoot their own people , they have n’t got a justice system and they want to take over this country			0
and we ’re not going to let them do it			0
' ' we 'll be suing them and they 'll be answering the questions			0
we ’ve had three judgments in the @entity245 and the @entity246 and an arbitration against these @entity11 mongrels			0
' i 'm saying that because they 're communist , they shoot their own people , they have n't got a justice system and they want to take over this country			0
and we 're not going to let them , ' he said			0
@entity6 softened his tone when he took to @entity258 but ramped it up again later in a radio interview that sparked a diplomatic firestorm and the maverick mp did soften his tone somewhat when he took to @entity258			1
' my # qanda comments not intended to refer to @entity11 people but to @entity11 company which is taking @entity104 resources & not paying '			2
@entity267 mp @entity6 says his looming court battle with @entity11 company @entity1 will reveal all but in typical style he jumped back into the fry - pan again late yesterday when quizzed on radio whether he stood by the mongrel comment , repeating his ' shooting their own people ' claims against the @entity11 government			1
' they ’re a government - owned body that executes people in @entity11 , does n’t give them the right of free speech , does n’t allow them to talk on the radio like i am now … they have one day trials , they do n’t have any democracy			2
' i feel for the @entity11 people that live under such tyranny			0
' i think ( they 're mongrels ) if they do that to people and kill them and shoot them , which they do do , and they do n’t have elections			0
i do n’t think that ’s the sort of values that we have in @entity15			0
' and today , in a statement , he has tried to close off the controversy by saying the comments he made were meant for ' one @entity11 state - owned company that has failed to honour its agreements and announcements made to the @entity303 in early 2006 '			2
' i have been an admirer of @entity11 and its people for many years , ' he said			0
' the @entity192 is very fortunate to have in its ranks @entity15 ’s first mainland - born @entity11 senator @entity191			2
i have been a major supporter of the @entity11 for a long time			0
' what is unacceptable is a @entity11 state - owned enterprise that abuses the legal system for commercial gain in a global strategic effort to control resources			0
' i can not support any deterioration of the living standards or the wage systems that any @entity104 or other person living in this country are entitled to under @entity104 law			0
no amount of money , no amount of lobbying should blind us from the duty to protect , ' he added .			0
