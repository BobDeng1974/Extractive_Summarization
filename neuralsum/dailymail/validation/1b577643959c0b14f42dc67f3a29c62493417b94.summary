we 've all spent countless hours looking at friends ' holiday snaps on @entity3 or @entity4 with a hint of jealousy , wishing we could be sitting on a beach , eating a fancy meal or spending the night in a luxurious hotel room			0
it can seem steep forking out for hotel stays night after night , but one couple has discovered the way to do it for free			0
@entity14 , 23 , and @entity15 , 26 , have taken advantage of the home - sitting craze , which allows people stay in strangers ' incredible houses while they are away - without having to spend a penny on accommodation			1

they left @entity79 in july 2013 , and currently have no plans to stop their worldwide adventure			0
home - sitting is a win - win situation , as home owners want people staying in their house to deter burglars , and most often , to look after their pets , in exchange for free lodging			1
