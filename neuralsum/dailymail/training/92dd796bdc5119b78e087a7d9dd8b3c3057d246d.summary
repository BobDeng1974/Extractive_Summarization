@entity2 of @entity3 's pregnancy could help save the @entity4 , polling experts said today			1
the royal couple 's decision to reveal @entity7 will have a sibling could stir a late swell of support for keeping the @entity11 together with ten days until the knife - edge vote			2
a new poll today revealed many voters demanding an independent @entity15 , or still undecided about the issue , want to keep the @entity17 as head of state			1
within minutes of @entity21 's announcement today there was speculation about whether the @entity2 ' second pregnancy could be the boost the stuttering ' no ' campaign needs and sway voters			1
could the baby save the @entity4 ? @entity2 of @entity3 , pictured in @entity15 in may , could influence the outcome of the independence ballot because many no voters consider themselves monarchists titles : the royals have strong links with @entity15 and the @entity36 and @entity37 use their titles of the @entity39 and @entity39 whenever they are there ( pictured on a distillery tour this summer ) support : @entity43 congratulated the couple today using their @entity15 titles			1
he says the @entity17 will remain head of state if he wins but others in his party disagree a @entity51 poll yesterday put support for independence at 51 per cent , with the no camp on 49 per cent			1
the @entity56 campaign has surrendered a 22 - point lead in the space of a month			2
on the back of this the @entity17 held talks with @entity61 yesterday amid panic at the prospect of the end of the 300 - year - old @entity4 , and there is said to be ‘ great concern ’ at @entity67 about the result			1
experts said today that @entity17 's worries and news of the royal baby could mark a key point in the campaign			1
a spokesman for @entity75 told @entity76 : ‘ @entity17 is generally very popular in the @entity11 and so are the young royals like the @entity36 and @entity37 , probably more so than prince @entity78 for example			0
‘ the royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the @entity17 ’s reported concerns and now @entity37 ’s pregnancy will bring that into focus			0
‘ there are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. it wo n’t be just because of the baby , but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result ’			1
the queen , pictured at the @entity97 in @entity15 , is thought to be strongly in favour of the @entity4 and will be in @entity15 on september 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the @entity11			1
her influence could save the @entity4 leader of the ' better together ' campaign and former @entity11 minister @entity104 argues with @entity15 's first minister @entity43 during the second live television debate on @entity15 independence			1
the two sides are neck - and - neck but a poll in the @entity111 today found that 40 per cent of yes voters say an independent @entity15 should keep the @entity17			1
a further 14 per cent of undecided voters are also monarchists			1
however it also emerged that yes voters are more anti-monarchist that first thought even though @entity43 has pledged that the @entity17 would stay as head of state			2
but the @entity119 ’s @entity118 and others are calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after @entity17 steps down or dies			0
on a recent visit @entity37 and @entity123 were showered with gifts for their baby son , @entity7 , including this mini kilt ( right ) made from local @entity39 tartan the royals have strong links with @entity15 , with the @entity17 always spending her summers at @entity131			2
a senior royal source was quoted as saying : ‘ @entity17 is a unionist			0
lots of people were telling us that it was going to be ok but there is now a great deal of concern			0
’ in may the @entity37 – using her @entity15 title the @entity39 – visited @entity15			0
@entity37 and her husband , also given the title @entity39 by the @entity17 on his marriage , were on a visit to the country ’s oldest distillery , @entity148 , home to the @entity150			0
@entity61 , at @entity131 yesterday with the @entity17 , was expected to reassure her that in the closing days of the campaign he intends to make the ‘ emotional argument ’ about all that @entity155 and @entity15 have achieved together and what ‘ we can continue to achieve ’			0
pro-union mps said her presence at @entity131 would be a sign of continuity			2
‘ there is a strong anti-monarchy element in the @entity119 , ’ said former defence secretary @entity161			0
‘ you can bet your bottom dollar as soon as they get independence , their next target is going to be @entity15 being a republic			2
’ sources have confirmed that the monarch will continue with her annual holiday at her private estate in the @entity175 , on september 18			0
the @entity176 insisted that the @entity17 was politically neutral , but one well - placed source said : ‘ you do n’t have to be a genius to work out the @entity17 is a unionist			0
is the @entity181 a @entity182 ? ’ a @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ the referendum is a matter for the people of @entity15 : the @entity17 remains strictly neutral on this , as she does on all political issues			0
@entity17 has maintained a close interest in the referendum as she does with all major matters of public debate and is being kept informed by her ministers and officials in the usual way			0
