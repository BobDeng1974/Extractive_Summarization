by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 16:14 est , 28 september 2013 @entity2 's reputation as an astonishing talent is matched only by his image as a temperamental ' bad boy ' he is an intense , charismatic and ambitious ballet prodigy who became the @entity7 ’s youngest ever principal at the age of 19			2
but @entity2 ’s reputation as an astonishing talent is matched only by his image as a temperamental ‘ bad boy ’ who has walked out of not one , but two @entity15 productions			2
he sent shockwaves through the dance world in april when he quit a much anticipated adaptation of @entity19 – barely a year after he stormed out of the @entity7 , where he wowed in productions such as @entity21			1
at the time of his latest walkout , @entity2 cited an unspecified ‘ health issue ’ for abandoning the @entity25 production			2
but now producers are suing him for £ 400,000 , claiming it was his wild partying that left him in no condition to perform			1
legal papers filed at the @entity31 accuse the troubled 23 - year - old @entity32 and his mentor @entity33 , who also quit the production , of indulging ‘ in a lifestyle which was not conducive to maintaining a sound state of health ’			1
the lawsuit , filed on behalf of producers @entity38 , continues : ‘ they engaged in intensive and potentially debilitating social activity			0
’ the brilliant but erratic @entity2 – who co-owns a @entity15 tattoo parlour – will have difficulty claiming a monastic devotion to his art. when he abruptly fled the @entity7 in 2012 , he revealed he had spent his nights clubbing , had taken drugs , and that he sometimes cut himself with razors for the adrenaline rush			1
he has also admitted dancing while high on cocaine			1
the legal papers reveal that the two dancers were due to be paid £ 7,000 for seven performances as @entity55 drug smugglers @entity53 – but they were also obliged to rehearse for two weeks before the show , for which they would each be paid £ 1,400			0
accused : @entity2 in @entity58			0
he revealed he had spent his nights clubbing , had taken drugs , and that he sometimes cut himself with razors when @entity2 and @entity33 failed to appear , the dance company was forced to hire two replacements , refund tickets worth £ 14,000 and reprint promotional material			1
producers also claim that ticket sales slumped when it became known that @entity2 and @entity33 would not be dancing – a loss the company put ‘ in the region of £ 400,000 ’			2
to make matters worse , it is believed the @entity38 company had neglected to take out the usual insurance against the non-appearance of its stars			0
according to the papers , both dancers emailed producers medical letters stating that they were not fit to work – but neither responded to the producers ’ request to attend a medical examination			0
@entity2 is now working in @entity83 but due to perform at a gala at @entity15 ’s @entity86 theatre tonight			1
neither dancer has commented on the legal action , but @entity2 ’s mother @entity89 said from @entity90 : ‘ as i understand , neither side will be making public statements			0
i do n’t know what their defence will be			0
’ @entity38 did not return calls , while the company ’s solicitors would not comment .			0
