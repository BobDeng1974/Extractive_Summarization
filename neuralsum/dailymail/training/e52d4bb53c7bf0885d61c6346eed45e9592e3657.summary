by @entity0 published : 09:07 est , 13 july 2012 updated : 09:21 est , 13 july 2012 @entity5 ’s ‘ management fee ’ for the @entity6 was increased almost tenfold to £ 60million despite the firm failing to provide enough security staff to protect @entity3			1
games organisers @entity8 agreed to raise it from £ 7.3 million to £ 60million , according to secret documents revealed today			1
almost £ 34million of the rise was for the @entity5 ‘ programme management office ’ to oversee the security operation , but it was so poorly handled 3,500 armed forces staff have now had to be rushed in			1
it came as it also emerged hundreds of a-level students have been hired as front - line guards at the @entity7 to fill the security void when it starts in two weeks			0
claims : @entity5 has allegedly increased its management fees almost tenfold despite failing to find enough staff to secure venues like the @entity24 they are among 3,300 teenagers recruited from colleges around @entity28 to help form a ring of steel at the venues for £ 8.50 an hour			1
security experts expressed alarm that youngsters aged 18 and 19 had been entrusted with searching spectators and bags			0
@entity5 ' management fee is thought to be almost ten times the amount that the firm has invested in recruiting security personnel for the games			1
it was initially estimated by the @entity42 that 10,000 security staff would be needed for the @entity6			1
@entity5 was contracted to provide 2,000 of those staff in 2010 at a cost of £ 86 million			1
falling short : @entity5 admitted it could not supply the 10,000 guards it promised to deliver but has raised its management fee to £ 60million but when the overall number of personnel required for the @entity7 rose to 23,500 last year , @entity5 was asked to provide 10,400 recruits			1
under the new contract with @entity8 , the organisers of @entity3 , the security company ’s overall fee rose to £ 284 million			1
the contract stipulated that @entity5 should train 3,300 students and 2,500 unpaid workers			1
a steward sub-contracted to work for under - fire security provider @entity5 at the @entity28 @entity61 was arrested for stealing a camera from a spectator ’s bag			1
the man , believed to be from @entity66 , was arrested after a visitor to the @entity69 race realised the camera was missing from his bag			1
@entity73 @entity72 have today confirmed they investigated the incident and arrested the man			0
he was later issued with a reprimand			0
the camera was later returned to the rightful owner			0
but their management fee for recruiting civilian staff rose from £ 7.3 million to £ 60 million , according to documents seen by the @entity83 , however , the documents show that the firm ’s spending on recruitment only increased by £ 2.8 million in the same period			1
in a statement to @entity89 ’s tonight programme , @entity5 said they had been ‘ absolutely transparent with @entity8 throughout ’			1
the company said that the ‘ revised proposal was subject to rigorous scrutiny and extensive negotiation … to ensure value for money			2
’ the firm also said that the amended contract gives ‘ significantly improved terms ’ and that there are ‘ caps on any profit that we will make ’			0
meanwhile the beleaguered security firm suffered further share price falls today amid fears that the @entity6 debacle will permanently damage its reputation			1
its shares fell 3 % on top of similar falls yesterday , meaning more than £ 200 million has been wiped off its value since the staffing problems emerged			2
meanwhile , there are fears that chief executive @entity117 , who will be hauled before @entity118 next week , will be forced out			0
he survived the collapse of a £ 5.2 billion takeover deal for @entity122 cleaning giant @entity121 last year after a shareholder rebellion scuppered the move , but the latest debacle has put his position under renewed pressure			2
@entity129 analyst @entity128 said : ' in terms of numbers , the @entity6 wo n't make much difference to people 's full - year forecasts			2
financially , it 's nothing significant			2
' people are not worried about numbers but about impact on reputation , which is hard to quantify			2
' potentially , there 's a danger it could lose further contracts			0
and there is the question is that the end for @entity117 ? ' @entity5 's revenues hit £ 7.5 billion last year , while underlying profits grew 2 % to £ 531 million and analysts said any shortfall from the @entity6 contract would not hurt the company			1
ms de @entity128 believes the company 's growth prospects remain strong because it is set to benefit from the public sector 's austerity drive as more authorities look to outsource work			1
last year , for example , @entity5 started running @entity161 prison , and a contract to run @entity164 prison in @entity165 started in april			2
and @entity5 won a ground - breaking £ 200 million contract to design and run a station for @entity72 , including running cells , administering drug tests and managing the force 's vehicle fleet			1
a retired police officer who was turned down by @entity6 company @entity5 was given an access all areas pass anyway in a ‘ massive breach ’ of security			1
@entity177 , a veteran of 32 years with @entity178 , was invited to collect his @entity6 pass , despite being turned down for a job with the security company			0
the 55 - year - old applied for a job with @entity5 in january and was told he had landed a role as a group leader during the games			2
but his job offer was rescinded because he was unable to attend training dates , and just hours later he was sent an e-mail inviting him to collect his security pass in @entity191			0
mr @entity177 claims that the pass , bearing the @entity5 logo , gives him access to secure sites across the @entity196 but said it could easily have been obtained by falsifying documents			2
last night he branded it as a ‘ spectacular failure ’ on the part of the organising chiefs despite the fact checks that had been made on a five - year history he provided them with			0
mr @entity177 , who works as an assistant manager at the @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity209 , said : ' last friday they emailed me saying i had been scheduled on training courses , but it would be in @entity66			2
' i was told i would be group leader supervisor , supervising the entrances , exits and pedestrian search areas			0
' but when i could n’t go to that training , they said i would n’t be able to do the job			0
' it was unspeakable stupidity , but then i got an email asking me to go and collect my accreditation			0
' mr @entity177 said he was disappointed by the levels of security at the games			0
he said : ' i ’ve got a background in anti-terrorism , i was in the special unit for 20 years dealing with firearms and intelligence gathering			0
' i got my licence from the @entity233 , in 2006 after i retired from @entity178			0
' i must be one of the most experienced applicants that they have but because the system is so unfit for purpose i now wo n’t be there			0
' they are not fulfilling the role that they are supposed to			0
' the @entity6 are going to be staffed by young inexperienced people who have no background in security			0

its *original* fee was only £ 7.3 million but @entity66 2012 chiefs have agreed to bump it up because more staff were needed
but the investment in recruitment by @entity5 only rose by £ 2.8 million in this time
meanwhile the company 's share price *slumps* again because of its damaged reputation
