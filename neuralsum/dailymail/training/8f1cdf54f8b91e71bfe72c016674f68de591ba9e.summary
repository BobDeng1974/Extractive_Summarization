the @entity15 designer , 53 , was asked to leave his job at @entity1 after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was @entity50 that he ' loves @entity51 ' and that her parents should have been ' gassed '			1
he then allegedly ranted to an @entity55 man sitting with her : ' * * * * ing @entity55 b * * * * * * , i 'm going to kill you			0
' two other women also complained to police about suffering anti-semitic abuse at the hands of the designer			1
shamed : fashion designer @entity0 sporting a clean look to publicise his new appointment ; right : arriving at court in 2011 following a video which emerged of him spewing anti-semitic and racist abuse face of @entity1 , @entity68 , was among those outraged by his remarks			1
at the time the @entity73 - winning actress said : ' in light of this video , and as an individual who is proud to be @entity50 , i will not be associated with mr @entity0 in any way			2
' i hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still - existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful			2
' @entity1 owners @entity83 cited a zero - tolerance policy on racism and anti-semitism and immediately gave the designer his marching orders			1
he was later charged in court and given suspended fines of 6,000 euros ( Â£ 5,250 )			0
since then , @entity0 has undergone treatment for drugs and alcohol and worked briefly as a designer for @entity98 fashion brand @entity96 in 2013			2

since @entity5 left , the label has been led by a team of designers			0
