@entity102 , from fellows , said : ' it is safe to say that @entity3 gets a little bit carried away in this letter			1
' the letter is fascinating , as it is as if @entity3 had no self - censorship when writing it			1
he spills all his thoughts and feelings down onto paper without giving it a second thought			0
' the result is a rather colourful letter that makes for quite cringy reading , peppered with terms of endearment like sweetheart and darling			2
' @entity3 does n't seem to be that interested in going to the opera - he makes it quite clear he would rather be cavorting with @entity9			1
' @entity3 obviously had a penchant for married women because by the early 1930s he was with @entity30 and @entity9 's attempts to contact him were blocked			1
she was totally cut out of the equation			0
' this letter is a fascinating piece of royal history			0
it is a private window into the heady relationship between the infamous prince and his mistress in their first months together			0
