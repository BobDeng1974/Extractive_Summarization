@entity1 ’s countdown to the @entity2 continues and all indications are that despite playing just four friendlies in four months he will be ready to start against @entity5 at the @entity6			1
since the @entity9 league computer decreed that @entity1 ’s ban for a bite on @entity12 at the @entity13 would end the same day as football ’s most expensive fixture between two of its bitterest rivals , @entity1 ’s focus has been on winning the race to be fit to start the match			1
at first he was hampered by the demands of moving his family from @entity22 to @entity23 and by @entity25 ’s ban on him training with team - mates or even setting foot inside the club ’s @entity30 headquarters			1
off the pitch he moved his family from his wife ’s parents ’ house in the @entity23 coastal town of @entity60 to a new home in nearby @entity62 where coach @entity63 and defender @entity64 also live			2
on the pitch a behind - closed - doors friendly with the b - team was followed by a specially organised match against an @entity69 in which he scored twice and passed up on the chance to complete his hat - trick from the spot so that the b - team ’s pre-designated spot - kick taker could score			0
he wanted former captain @entity75 to present him with the @entity76 this week for his 31 goals scored at @entity22 last season			2
when @entity75 confirmed he would not be able to make it @entity1 insisted on the next best thing – @entity81 the man who brought him to @entity22 in january 2011			1
@entity83 chases after the ball during @entity35 's clash with @entity38 in @entity86 the @entity23 star unleashes a venomous volley that hits the post , rebounding off a defender into the net he also wanted the trophy to be presented to him at @entity94 but @entity22 ’s next home game comes the weekend of the @entity2 so the @entity76 will instead be handed over on wednesday in @entity23			1
the player still wants the chance to show it off in front of the @entity99 before the season ends			0
before the @entity76 presentation , he will play the second of two international friendlies in @entity104 on monday			0
whether for the third bite , or the signing for @entity23 — or both — his commercial value appears higher than ever			0
@entity35 ’s matches against @entity38 and @entity104 have earned their football association around £ 1,000,000 — that is twice what they would have been paid had the player , who is banned for eight further competitive internationals , not been part of the team			1
friday ’s pre-agreed 70 minute run - out was marked by all - but scoring @entity35 ’s only goal in a 1 - 1 draw			1
a thunderous right - foot volley came back off the post and rebounded over the line off defender @entity124			0
he looked predictably short of match sharpness but a long way from the ‘ overweight ex-footballer ’ description given him by the @entity131 media after his last friendly			0
@entity1 ( standing on the football ) takes it all in at @entity23 training as the players have a team meeting the world 's third most expensive player smiles despite his long four - month ban from competitive football @entity23 supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season means he makes an instant impact on his return			1
after serving his 10 - game ban for biting @entity147 , @entity1 scored twice on his league return			1
that afternoon a @entity150 side still reeling from the mismanagement of @entity152 and under the temporary stewardship of @entity154 were the opponents , and not @entity5			2
another precedent lends itself to the theory that his delayed start need not be a problem			0
when @entity161 signed for @entity23 from @entity162 in august 1973 for 120m pesetas ( just over £ 500,000 ) a bureaucratic problem meant the team had already played the first seven fixtures before @entity161 could play			2
when he finally got to make his debut in the last week of october he scored twice against @entity166 in a 4 - 0 win			2
speaking with @entity9 radio on friday night @entity169 manager @entity168 said he thought @entity1 had the quality to fit right in to any side in any league			0
‘ he created @entity22 ’s great season without any doubt , ’ he said			0
‘ he will give @entity23 something they did n’t have before			0
’ on wednesday in @entity5 @entity178 , who also scored 31 league goals last season , will be awarded his @entity76			2
ten days later the two top marksmen will come face to face in what @entity183 always referred to as the match that stops the world — it will be the man who ca n’t stop scoring , against the man who ca n’t wait to start ’			0
@entity23 striker @entity1 surveys the lay of the land as his team - mates watch on at training @entity1 , @entity35 's top scorer with 40 goals in 78 caps , looked sharp as they took on @entity38 @entity1 uploaded a @entity196 selfie with his @entity35 team - mates as he enjoyed playing for his country again			1

the striker looks set to make his competitive comeback against @entity5 on october *26*
played first @entity35 game since biting @entity12 at the @entity13
set up a goal in the 1 - 1 draw versus @entity38 on *saturday*
after his last *lengthy* ban @entity1 scored two goals on his comeback for @entity22 against @entity150
eyes of the world will be watching when @entity23 travel to the @entity214
