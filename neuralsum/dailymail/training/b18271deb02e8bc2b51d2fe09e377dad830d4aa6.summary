the @entity0 returns on tuesday evening and we 've reached the fourth - round stage			1
just 16 teams remain - nine @entity4 , four @entity5 , two @entity6 and one @entity7 - and @entity8 is just about moving within reach			2
we take a look at 10 things to look out for ahead of the midweek action			0
@entity13 lifted the @entity0 last season - but who will follow in their footsteps this time ? tuesday @entity16 vs @entity17 ( 7.45pm ) @entity18 vs @entity19 ( 7.45pm ) @entity20 vs @entity21 ( 7.45pm ) live on @entity22 1 @entity23 vs @entity24 ( 8pm ) @entity25 vs @entity26 ( 8pm ) wednesday @entity13 vs @entity27 ( 7.45pm ) live on @entity22 1 @entity28 vs @entity29 ( 7.45pm ) @entity30 vs @entity31 ( 7.45pm ) @entity25 and @entity32 their inconsistent form has probably already put paid to a repeat of last season 's @entity4 challenge , so @entity25 may well target one of the @entity39			1
after their marathon penalty shoot - out success against @entity42 in round three , they now face @entity26 at @entity44 on tuesday night			1
with changes expected to be made , it remains to be seen if the misfiring @entity48 - who still has just the one goal since his arrival - is given another chance to prove himself			2
the @entity55 have already suffered five defeats this season and though the @entity0 is last on their list of priorities , another one here will be sorely felt			2
misfiring @entity48 will be hoping to retain his place and find some form for @entity25 against @entity26 @entity26 hoping for repeat performance @entity26 won 3 - 1 at @entity44 at this same stage in 2012 en route to lifting the @entity0 , the first major piece of silverware in the club 's history			1
@entity70 's side have started the @entity4 season well - currently sitting sixth - and they will hope this form translates to the @entity0			2
they 've already dumped out one @entity74 opponent already , beating @entity75 3 - 0 in the last round			2
having been part of that 2013 - winning team , @entity78 will fancy another long @entity0 run and is expected to resist wholesale changes to his line - up , though @entity84 and @entity85 will be rested			2
@entity78 is , of course , going head - to - head with a former manager at @entity26 in @entity89			1
@entity90 ( centre ) was on target when @entity26 beat @entity25 3 - 1 at this stage two seasons ago @entity20 's @entity95 this was the fixture that jumped out from the fourth round draw - a real @entity100 tie in the best of @entity0 tradition			1
a staggering 72 places separate @entity4 leaders @entity21 and their @entity7 opponents @entity20 but a sell - out crowd at the @entity107 will be cheering on the underdogs			1
the @entity109 have already dumped @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 out of the competition and their manager @entity114 believes anything can happen			0
' we are n't here to clap people on to the pitch , ' he said			0
' we going to try and knock them out			0
we know the task is massive but we want to reach the quarter - finals			0
' while @entity21 's squad cost Â£ 307m to assemble , the @entity109 ' side was put together on a shoestring			0
but knockout football can be a great leveller			0
@entity20 manager @entity114 ( right ) celebrates with @entity128 after their win at @entity111 showcase for @entity21 's kids @entity21 have one of the best academies in the country and are the current holders of the @entity135 and @entity136			1
and some of their emerging talents are likely to feature at @entity20 on tuesday , including @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0
@entity143 defender @entity140 has already tasted first - team football and started in the last round against @entity146			0
@entity147 20 international @entity139 has made just one first - team appearance but is hotly tipped to become a star for club and country			0
@entity141 is also highly - regarded by @entity152 and came on last week in the @entity154 match with @entity155			0
he helped @entity147 win the @entity156 in the summer			0
@entity157 playmaker @entity142 , 17 , is a regular starter in the @entity158 and the @entity159			0
@entity141 featured in @entity21 's @entity154 win over @entity155 last week @entity16 hoping to continue scoring spree nobody will fancy taking on the in - form @entity162 at the moment , especially after their 8 - 0 rout of @entity164 at the weekend			1
@entity166 's team sit fourth in the @entity5 and they have won their last four matches , so this will be a real test for @entity170 's @entity17			2
it is 51 years since @entity16 last made it to the fourth round and this is the furthest they 've ever progressed , so history could be made on tuesday night			1
' they are really nice milestones because you do n't set out to achieve things like that ... hopefully someone will be talking in 50 years ' time about this team , ' said @entity166			0
@entity170 must decide whether to rest players ahead of the weekend trip to @entity111 but that could prove a dangerous strategy			0
@entity16 celebrate @entity188 's ( right ) goal on saturday , the fifth in their 8 - 0 win at @entity164 league one duo hoping to make a name for themselves as @entity196 proved when they reached the final in 2013 , lower league clubs can progress in this competition			1
so though the meeting of @entity6 sides @entity18 and @entity19 is not the most glamorous tie of the round , both will see it as an opportunity			1
the @entity18 created a seismic shock when they thrashed @entity206 4 - 0 in the second round and are into the fourth round for the first time in their history			1
the @entity212 , who profited from an unexpected run to the semi-finals of last season 's @entity216 , enter the contest in good form , having won their last three matches			0
@entity18 striker @entity221 celebrates his goal during their 4 - 0 rout of @entity206 in the second round another chance for @entity226 to stake his claim when these two sides met back in august , @entity24 thrashed sorry - looking @entity23 5 - 1			1
fast forward two months and the @entity230 side are a very different proposition			0
caretaker boss @entity226 has galvanised the @entity232 since he took over from @entity233 and has won five of his eight matches in temporary charge			0
a win against @entity24 on tuesday night and a place in the last eight of the @entity0 will further boost his chances			1
@entity242 's team are currently top of the @entity5 but produced their worst performance for some time in losing at home to @entity246 at the weekend			0
still , they will head to @entity248 as the favourites			0
@entity226 has another opportunity to stake his claim for the @entity23 job on a full - time basis against @entity24 saints hoping koeman renaissance continues after that exodus of talent in the summer , few expected to see @entity29 second in the @entity4 table at the start of november			1
@entity261 reinvested the transfer cash shrewdly and with the likes of @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 impressing , they are flying high			0
having beaten @entity28 1 - 0 at @entity269 's on saturday , they face a quick re-match at the @entity271 on wednesday night			1
@entity28 boss @entity272 lifted the @entity0 with three different clubs - @entity206 , @entity21 and @entity274 - and back - to - back home wins over @entity26 and @entity27 suggest their fortunes are improving			1
@entity272 and @entity261 are set for a speedy reunion when @entity28 host @entity29 on wednesday @entity279 set for @entity280 after losing further ground in the title race at @entity283 on saturday , @entity13 will be seeking a return to winning ways when they play @entity27 at the @entity286 on wednesday night			1
with a derby against @entity19 looming on sunday , @entity287 is expected to make changes and @entity290 could return after a month out following groin surgery			2
@entity13 lifted the @entity0 last season and regard the competition as worthwhile			2
they will start as clear favourites against @entity27			0
sunday 's win at @entity30 lifted some of the pressure on manager @entity298 but he 'll admit the @entity0 plays second fiddle to trying to avoid a relegation struggle this season			2
@entity290 is set to make his return from injury when @entity13 take on @entity27 @entity31 seeking to pile more misery on spurs @entity30 were heavily criticised after throwing away the lead to lose at home to @entity27 on sunday and recent results have shown they are far from top four material			1
the @entity0 should offer some comfort to @entity310 and his under - performing team but they 'll have to be on their guard against @entity31 on wednesday night			1
@entity310 is likely to rotate his squad for the visit of @entity316 's men , who currently sit one place outside the relegation zone after a very disappointing start to the season			0
having said that , @entity31 have gone 10 league matches without a win and so @entity30 will start as clear favourites			1
@entity310 desperately needs an improved performance from his @entity30 side against @entity31			2

the @entity0 returns with eight fourth round ties
@entity48 will be hoping to keep his place as @entity25 host @entity26
league two @entity20 have their big night against @entity21
@entity290 could return for @entity13 against @entity27
@entity17 face tricky trip to free - scoring @entity16
@entity30 hope to return to winning ways against @entity31
@entity18 and @entity19 go head - to - head in all - @entity6 affair
@entity226 bids for another win as @entity23 welcome @entity24
@entity28 and @entity29 meet for second time in five days
