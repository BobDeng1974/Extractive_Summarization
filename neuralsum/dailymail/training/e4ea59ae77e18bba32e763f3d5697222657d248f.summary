@entity0 criticised referee @entity1 and accused @entity2 of tricking the official into awarding @entity4 a penalty			1
@entity0 was unhappy that @entity1 did not show @entity6 a red card for tugging @entity9 ’s shirt when he was through on goal moments before he awarded a penalty for @entity13 ’s challenge on @entity2 who then scored from the spot			1
‘ the decision on @entity6 is difficult to understand , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s outside the box but there is no other @entity4 defender			1
he ’s the last man and it ’s a clear goalscoring opportunity			0
@entity2 hits the turf , leading to a penalty for @entity4 which the forward converted to win the game @entity2 wheels away in celebration after scoring the only goal of the game at @entity30 ‘ i do n’t understand why it ’s a yellow card			1
it should be a red			0
it ’s very different to play against 10 men than 11 , especially against a side who worked well defensively			0
’ @entity0 pointed to an incident in @entity40 ’s draw at @entity41 last month when they were awarded a penalty by @entity1 but the referee took no action against @entity46 who was the last man			1
‘ my disappointment is we had the same situation last time at @entity41 that was a clear mistake			0
it was a real bad sign to see the same referee make mistakes applying the same rule			2
’ @entity9 and @entity56 clash after the @entity40 defender was brought down by @entity58 @entity0 said he understood why @entity1 awarded a penalty against @entity40 but only because @entity2 had made the most of little contact from @entity13			1
‘ i know the @entity63 culture well , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ you ’ve been brought up in a way that you ’re forcing the referee to make a decision			2
‘ i do n’t think there ’s enough contact for it to be a penalty			0
if he does n’t give the red card because he ’s not sure i do n’t understand why he gives a penalty because he ca n’t be sure it is one			0
’ @entity4 boss @entity74 had a different view of both incidents			2
‘ @entity58 pulled him back but i do n’t think it ’s a red because i do n’t think you can say it was a clear goalscoring opportunity , ’ said @entity74			0
‘ for the penalty , defenders have to be careful and his leg has been clipped			0
’ @entity0 was aggrieved with the performance of referee @entity1 ( above )			1
