a @entity1 chief says staff are committed to the protection of the public from those who exploit the so - called ' dark web '			1
file picture @entity1 now concentrates on the ' darkest places ' of the internet inhabited by ' the plotters , the proliferators and the paedophiles ' , its outgoing head stressed yesterday			2
its staff are committed to the protection of the public from those who exploit the so - called ' dark web ' , sir @entity14 said			1
sir @entity14 , who retires this month after six years in charge , also insisted @entity22 's electronic eavesdropping agency did not engage in ' anything remotely resembling mass surveillance '			1
while he acknowledged that tracking down perpetrators online meant accessing the internet ' at scale ' , he said his organisation was committed to delivering security while protecting privacy to the ' greatest extent possible '			1
his comments come after a turbulent year for the intelligence agency , overshadowed by the disclosures of the former @entity36 intelligence operative @entity35			1
@entity1 has also come under criticism after it was revealed earlier this year they are allowed to spy on @entity22 citizens ' use of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 without an individual warrant because the firms are based overseas			2
speaking at the @entity46 in @entity47 , sir @entity14 issued an impassioned defence of its work , while paying tribute to his staff , some of whom he said had made ' the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty ' - although he gave no further details			1
referring to his staff , he added : ' the people who work at @entity1 would sooner walk out the door than be involved in anything remotely resembling ' mass surveillance '			1
' my staff are the embodiment of @entity22 values , not a threat to them			1
' @entity1 and its @entity36 counterpart , the @entity68 , came under fire from civil liberties campaigners on both sides of the @entity72 after mr @entity35 leaked thousands of documents revealing the scale of their surveillance activities			1
after mr @entity35 revealed @entity1 was gathering millions of pieces of date on @entity22 citizens , sir @entity14 was forced to defend his organisation to @entity80 in an unprecedented public hearing			1
in the hearing before the government 's @entity86 , alongside the heads of @entity83 and @entity84 , he claimed terrorists had started changing their tactics because of mr @entity35 's revelations			2
director of @entity1 sir @entity14 said : ' my staff are the embodiment of @entity22 values , not a threat to them ' yesterday sir @entity14 sought to underline the scale of the challenge facing the agencies - describing the ' enormous exodus ' to the internet as ' the biggest migration in human history '			1
he said that only a small percentage of all the emails , texts and images sent globally were within reach of @entity1 's sensors - of which only a small percentage were actually intercepted			2
but he acknowledged the volumes were still large			0
he said : ' we access the internet at scale so as to dissect it with surgical precision			0
practically , it is now impossible to operate successfully in any other way			0
' you ca n't pick and choose the components of a global interception system that you like - catching terrorists and paedophiles - and those you do n't - incidental collection of data at scale : it 's one integrated system			0
' with the ' vast majority ' of such criminal threats to the @entity22 coming from groups or individuals based abroad , sir @entity14 said strong intelligence and cyber capabilities were needed to identify and - where they were beyond the reach of international law enforcement - directly disrupt them			1
he said : ' we all now know that the beautiful dream of the internet as a totally ungoverned space was just that – a beautiful dream			0
like all utopian visions , it was flawed because it failed to account for the persistence of the worst aspects of human nature			0
' alongside the blessings – the comprehensive information , the communities of interest , the commercial opportunities and efficiencies – there are the plotters , the proliferators and the paedophiles			0
' from what we know of ungoverned spaces in the real world , do we really believe that the world would be a better place if the @entity138 becomes an ungoverned space where anybody can act freely with impunity ? ' @entity1 ( pictured ) and its @entity36 counterpart , the @entity68 , came under fire from civil liberties campaigners on both sides of the @entity72 after @entity35 leaked thousands of documents revealing the scale of their surveillance activities he added : ' those who would do us harm do n't want to be found			2
they use certain routers or applications to hide in the darkest places of the internet			0
' we have to enter that labyrinth to find them			0
we work to crack their defences			0
we have to understand what adversaries seek to do to us and dedicate ourselves to preventing them from realising their plans			0
' he stressed that the ' core ' of @entity1 's mission was ' the protection of liberty , not the erosion of it ' and that it actively sought to minimise intrusion into people 's everyday lives			0
he added : ' by definition , the acquisition , aggregation , usage , sharing and retention of information involve varying degrees of interference with , or intrusion into , the privacy rights of individuals			2
' so those activities can only be undertaken if judged to be necessary in the interests of our statutory purposes - national security , economic well - being or the prevention and detection of serious crime - and proportionate in what we seek to achieve			2
' @entity1 was formed in 1919 and employed @entity220 code - breaker @entity218 in the @entity221 .			0

sir @entity14 said agency is not engaged in ' mass surveillance '
organisation is committed to ' delivering security while protecting privacy '
he praised staff , some of whom he said had made ' the ultimate sacrifice '
