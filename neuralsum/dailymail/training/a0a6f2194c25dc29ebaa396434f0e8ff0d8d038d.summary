the @entity1 programme might seem an unlikely time and place for a sex symbol to emerge			1
yet it is attracting a whole new audience of red - blooded males – thanks to presenter @entity9			1
her increasingly racy choice of outfits has ensured a huge following for the curvaceous mother of three on @entity14 and @entity15			1

another commented : ‘ @entity9 was looking spicy			1
’ a third added : ‘ @entity45			1
no news is bad news when she ’s reading it			1
’ miss @entity9 added : ‘ i have not made any particular special effort , but i do n’t want to seem ungrateful because it is always nice to hear that people like what you are wearing			1
‘ perhaps it is because i am approaching my birthday and i ’m in a more celebratory mood			2
‘ i am not going to be coy , i do most of my shopping online			2
and at that time of the morning it is important we all make an effort to look colourful and cheerful			2
’ this week , @entity60 tweeted : ‘ tell me the news @entity9 , and may i say , what a smashing blouse you ’re wearing			2
’ miss @entity9 also has videos dedicated to her on @entity15 , with clips of her on @entity1			1
