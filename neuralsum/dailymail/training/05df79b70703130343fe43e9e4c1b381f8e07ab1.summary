when @entity2 's identity was stolen , the thief did n't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts			1
she assumed @entity2 's persona completely , using it to get a job , a driver 's license , a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children			1
all the while , the crook claimed the real @entity2 was the one who had stolen her identity			2
the women 's kafkaesque nightmare puts a face on ' total identity theft , ' a brazen form of the crime in which con artists go far beyond financial fraud to assume many other aspects of another person 's life			1
the scheme has been linked to illegal immigrants who use stolen @entity31 numbers to get paid at their jobs , and authorities fear the problem could soon grow to ensnare more unsuspecting @entity35			2
defrauded : @entity38 school teacher @entity37 , pictured had her identity stolen several years ago and has been battling with the government since @entity2 learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago			1
now she trudges to the @entity41 with her birth certificate , driver 's license , passport to prove her identity ' when she claimed my identity and i claimed it back , she was informed that i was claiming it too , ' said @entity2 , a 31 - year - old @entity38 elementary school teacher			1
' she knew i was aware and that i was trying to fight , and yet she would keep fighting			0
it is not like she realized and she stopped			0
no , she kept going , and she kept going harder			0
' a 32 - year - old illegal immigrant named @entity51 is accused of using @entity2 's identity during a 10 - year period when she worked at a @entity55 company that packages refrigerated foods			1
for years , large numbers of illegal immigrants have filled out payroll forms using their real names but stolen @entity31 numbers			2
however , as electronic employment verification systems such as e-verify become more common , the use of fake numbers is increasingly difficult			0
now prosecutors worry that more people will try to fool the systems by assuming full identities rather than stealing the numbers alone			0
for victims , total identity theft can also have serious health consequences if electronic medical records linked to @entity31 numbers get mixed up , putting at risk the accuracy of important patient information such as blood types or life - threatening allergies			1
@entity82 statistics show that @entity35 reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011 , up from 251,100 a year earlier			1
while it is unclear how many of those cases involve total identity theft , one possible indicator is the number of identity theft complaints that involve more than one type of identity theft - 13 percent last year , compared with 12 percent a year earlier			1
when @entity2 's identity was stolen , the thief did n't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts			1
she assumed her persona completely , using it to get a job , a license , a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children nationwide , employment - related fraud accounted for 8 percent of identity theft complaints last year			1
but in states with large immigrant populations , employment - related identity fraud was much higher : 25 percent in @entity108 , 15 percent in @entity109 , 16 percent in @entity110 , 12 percent in @entity111			2
prosecutors say that the longer a person uses someone else 's identity , the more confident the thief becomes using that identity for purposes other than just working			1
' it is such a horrible nightmare			0
you get really angry , and then you start realizing anger is not going to help			0
but when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life , it is really such a big inconvenience			0
' once they have become established in a community , identity thieves do n't want to live in the shadows and they seek a normal life like everybody else			2
that 's when they take the next step and get a driver 's license , a home loan and health insurance			2
' and so that is a natural progression , and that is what we are seeing , ' said assistant u.s. attorney @entity143 , who is prosecuting the case against @entity2 's alleged impostor			2
@entity2 first learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago			2
now each year she trudges to the @entity41 with her birth certificate , driver 's license , passport and even school yearbooks to prove her identity and clear her employment record			1
she spends hours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus , fills out affidavits and has yet to clean up her credit history			0
her tax records are a mess			0
she even once phoned the impostor 's @entity161 employer in a futile effort to find some relief			2
both women claimed they were identity theft victims and sought to get new social security numbers			1
the @entity41 turned down the request from @entity2 , instead issuing a new number to the woman impersonating her			0
@entity82 statistics show that @entity35 reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011 , up from 251,100 a year earlier and in another ironic twist , @entity2 was forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants			1
' it is such a horrible nightmare , ' @entity2 said			0
' you get really angry , and then you start realizing anger is not going to help			0
... but when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life , it is really such a super big inconvenience			0
you have to find the time for someone who is abusing you			0
' when @entity2 recently got married , her husband began researching identity theft on the @entity191 and stumbled across identity theft cases filed against other illegal immigrants working at @entity194 , the same manufacturer where @entity51 worked			1
he contacted federal authorities in @entity161 and asked them to investigate the employee working there who had stolen his wife 's identity			1
the alleged impostor was arrested in august , and her fingerprints confirmed that immigration agents had encountered @entity51 in 1996 in @entity204 , @entity109 , and sent her back to @entity110			2
@entity51 did not respond to a letter sent to her at the @entity207 jail , where she is awaiting trial on charges of aggravated identity theft , misuse of a social security number and production of a false document			1
her attorney , @entity215 , did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment			0
court filings indicate the two sides are negotiating a plea agreement			0
citing privacy issues , the @entity41 declined to discuss the @entity2 case			0
@entity194 did not return a message left at its @entity55 plant			0
@entity143 expects more cases of total identity theft ' because we all know what is going on out there - which is thousands and thousands of people who are working illegally in the @entity35 under false identities , mostly of @entity35 citizens , and very little is being done about it			1
but we are doing something about it , one case at a time			0
