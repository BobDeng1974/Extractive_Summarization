@entity0 has officially rolled out its ‘ retweet with comment ’ feature , which , unsurprisingly lets people annotate the tweets of others			1
this image shows the new button , ' @entity25 , ' which triggers the action @entity0 began testing its tool last summer			2
until now , @entity0 users have had to embed tweets by cutting and pasting a url and then adding a comment , within the 140 character limit			1
but now the process is available at the touch of a button and is going down well on the social network			0
a user called @entity38 tweeted : ‘ at last @entity0 officially launches “ @entity41 ” feature so you do n't need to edit original tweets , ’ while @entity39 said : ‘ @entity41 with comment is the best feature since retweet ’			1

’ the tv chef then commented on another that she shared , which said : ‘ also this is great news for tweeters like @ @entity95 who quotes tweets a lot ’ simply adding : ‘ it is indeed ! ’ others made references to @entity101 and quote tweeted a message about retweeting with comments , to point out the cyclical nature of the roll - out			0
as well as allowing people 116 characters with which to construct a comment , the new feature preserves the context and meaning of an original tweet , @entity107 noted			1
the platform is gradually evolving to let its users express themselves in more detail , instead of simple phrases that fit within the character count			0
users have got around the problem by using unofficial techniques such as posting screenshots and using apps such as @entity125 and @entity126 that extend the character limit			0
the feature does n’t allow users to comment on a string of tweets , to produce one mammoth message and users ca n’t retweet their own quote tweets .			1
