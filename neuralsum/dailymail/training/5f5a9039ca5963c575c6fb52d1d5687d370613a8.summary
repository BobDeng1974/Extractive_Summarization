‘ my allergies grew so bad that i lived in fear of libraries and common rooms as even a small inhalation of dust could bring on an asthma attack which would completely shut down my airways			2

when she was at university , she had a severe asthma attack after opening a dusty book in a library and had to be hospitalised ms @entity9 first attended @entity61 ’s @entity47 in @entity62 but lasted only a term as her continual allergy - related health problems meant she spent more time in the hospital than in her halls			1

when she is at home , ms @entity9 and her family have to vacuum and dust daily , change the hypoallergenic sheets every day and never open the windows during summer for fear of letting in pollen she said : ‘ it ’s really hard , i have to battle so much just to achieve normal things			1
‘ one day i was studying , i ’d got my friends to get the books off the shelves in the library as that is normally a danger area for me			0
‘ as i got the book out of my bag and opened it , it must have wafted a cloud of dust into my face because i felt my airways closing and was struggling to breathe			2
‘ it was a terrible reaction and i ended up back in hospital			0
’ ms @entity9 now studies medical sciences with the @entity47 from the safety of her own home where she and her family have to stick to a strict cleaning regime			1

ms @entity9 had to give up her dream of remaining at university but she is now doing a degree from home through the @entity47 she said : ‘ older , dustier books trigger my allergies so fewer , newer books definitely minimises the risks			1

‘ my allergies have such a big impact on my life it ’s inevitable that they would influence my choices for the future			0
‘ all my friends have been to university , moved away from home and had an amazing time			0
