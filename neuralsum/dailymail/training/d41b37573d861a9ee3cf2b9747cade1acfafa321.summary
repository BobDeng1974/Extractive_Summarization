by @entity0 published : 20:37 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 20:38 est , 16 january 2013 sunbeds are twice as likely to cause skin cancer than a holiday in the @entity5 , scientists warn			1
they say the risks posed to users - who mainly comprise young women - are far higher than previously thought			2
the experts found that on average sunbeds in @entity11 are emitting harmful radiation that is twice as high as the recommended safe levels			1
they have calculated that a ten minute session on a sunbed is twice as likely to cause skin cancer than spending the same time in the midday sun in the @entity5			0
dangerous : using a sunbed is twice as likely to give you skin cancer than a holiday in the @entity5 the @entity22 has stated that sunbeds are as lethal as cigarettes and they are listed as one of the most dangerous , cancer - causing habits			1
but until now there has been limited information on the risks posed by sunbeds in this country			1
last year the government banned the under 18s from using the sunbeds but there are fears this law is not being properly enforced			2
many gyms and beauty salons run coin - operated sunbeds which are n't supervised so there is nothing to stop teenagers using them as often as they want			2
professor @entity45 , who carried out the research , accused the sunbed industry of putting young women and other users at risk			0
' this situation is unacceptable and stricter control measures must be put in place			0
' ' the development of high - power sunlamps , along with clear failures of the sunbed industry to regulate themselves effectively , is putting young people at an even greater risk of skin cancer than we previously thought			0
' healthier option : a woman sunbathing by the pool for ten minutes in the midday sun in the @entity5 is half as likely to get skin cancer than someone who spends ten minutes on a sun bed the researchers from the @entity71 tested the strength of radiation emitted by sunbeds at 402 tanning salons and beauticians in @entity11			1
they also estimated the risk of skin cancer and compared this to natural sunlight			0
their findings , published in the @entity82 , show that 90 per cent of sunbeds are emitting radiation that is higher than the safety standards set by the @entity86			1
and the radiation produced by one sunbed was so strong it was six times more likely to cause skin cancer than the @entity5 sun. cases of malignant melanoma - the deadliest skin cancer - have doubled in the last decade , according to figures from @entity95			2
around 13,000 @entity96 are diagnosed with the illness each year and it causes 2,800 deaths			0
research has previously found that a using a sunbed before the age of 35 increases the risk of malignant melanoma by nearly 90 per cent			0
@entity106 , senior health information officer at @entity95 , which funded the study said : ' it 's worrying to see that so many sunbeds in @entity11 are not meeting the safety standards			1
' this strengthens our advice that using a sunbed just is n't worth it			0
