how do you stop your biscuit breaking and mixing with your tea when you dunk it in your drink ? thanks to a new product that 's a conundrum that might never trouble tea drinkers again			1
a cylindrical mesh pouch has gone on sale that dips into your cup and catches any stray biscuit , letting you enjoy your drink in peace even after subjecting it to a gruelling dunking session			1
the £ 2 ( $ 3.25 ) @entity19 ( shown ) is a meshed pouch that is lowered into a beverage			1
when a biscuit is dunked inside it the bag catches any breakages			1
using a string the drinker can then get the bag and the crumbs out of the tea the device was designed by dad of two @entity33 from @entity16 , @entity34			1
solved the age - old problem with a canny mesh pouch which is immersed inside a mug of tea			1
the drinker dips their biscuits in the mug like normal but the pouch collects any unwanted bits that might float off during the dunking process			2
and even if the biscuit becomes too soggy and breaks off altogether the gadget will guarantee drinkers are not left with a heap of biscuity sludge at the bottom of their cup			0
dunkers know that insufficient biscuit submersion results in an unsatisfying experience ; waiting too long causes the biscuit to break apart , leaving an unpleasant sludge in the bottom of the mug			0
but research , conducted by dr @entity62 , suggests there is a science behind the dunk , with the humble @entity66 named most robust biscuit for dunking			0
in addition vertical submersion is best , and the fat content of the biscuit and the temperature of the liquid are crucial in the success of your dunking ventures			0
the length of time a biscuit can be dunked is roughly proportional to the amount of fat and sugar in a biscuit			2
the sweeter and more buttery a biscuit , the faster it will break apart when dunking			0
once the drinker has finished dunking they can lift the washable pouch out using an attached string and continue drinking the tea as normal			1
mr @entity33 apparently dreamed up the design after watching family members dunking their biscuits for too long			0
he now hopes his product , called the @entity19 , will become a staple in homes around @entity97			0
the products are made of so nylon they can be washed out and re-used			1
despite only launching the product two weeks ago mr @entity33 has already sold more than 600 cookie catchers , which cost £ 2 ( $ 3.25 )			1
' the idea came to me when after a big lunch my family were all sat around drinking tea and tucking into a selection box of biscuits , ' said mr @entity33			0
' my brother had drunk a bit much at lunch and kept over-dunking his biscuits in his tea			0
every time he left them in the tea too long and they would break off			0

' we all said that someone should invent a device that catches the crumbs and stops your tea being full of bits			2
' it got me thinking			0
i 've always been entrepreneurial so i took the idea away and came up with this little mesh sack that sits inside your tea cup and catches all the bits			2
' when you 're done dunking you whip it out of the mug using the attached string and you can enjoy the rest of your tea with no bits in			2
he adds that it can also be washed out and used over and over again as it is made from nylon			2
' anyone who has ever dunked a biscuit in tea will understand what this product is all about , ' he continued			1
' it 's a @entity97 solution to a very @entity97 problem			0
' we have only just launched and we 've already sold about 600 cookie catchers , so they 're obviously striking a chord with the tea drinkers of @entity97			0
' despite only launching the product two weeks ago mr @entity33 has already sold more than 600 cookie catchers , which cost £ 2 ( $ 3.25 ) this scenario shown , of a biscuit ruining a cup of tea , might never be a problem again			1
