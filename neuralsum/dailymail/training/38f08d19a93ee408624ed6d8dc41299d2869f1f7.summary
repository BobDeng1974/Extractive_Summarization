they hope a multi-million pound expedition to sample some of the ice will solve an ancient climate change mystery that continues to baffle experts			1
by studying cores of ice , the researchers believe they could reveal why the @entity6 ’s atmosphere underwent a transition roughly one million years ago			1
three kilometres under the @entity12 ice sheet are layers of compacted snow that fell up to one - and - half million years ago and trapped bubbles of the @entity6 ’s atmosphere at the time			1
scientists on the planned exhibition , which could cost in the region of £ 40million , would extract this natural log book by extracting an ice core between 2.4 and three km long from the @entity12 ice shelf			1
experimental climate physicist , professor @entity35 , at the @entity33 , @entity9 said : ' the @entity36 is a most important and enigmatic time interval in the more recent climate history of our planet			1
' the @entity6 ’s climate naturally varies between times of warming and periods of extreme cooling ( ice ages ) over thousands of years			1
' before the transition , the period of variation was about 41,000 years while afterwards it became 100,000 years			0
the reason for this change is not known			0
' using tried and tested techniques , the scientists plan to drill deep into the shelf to access the oldest layers of ice			2
professor @entity57 said : ' ice cores contain little air bubbles and thus represent the only direct archive of the composition of the past atmosphere			0
a previous expedition in 2003 managed to extract ice 800,000 years old at a site called @entity66 , but professor @entity57 and colleagues hope to nearly double that in the near future			2
the deeper scientists drill into the ice , the more difficult it gets to retrieve an accurate sample			0
the beginnings of a bore hole in ice is pictured ' the information on greenhouse - gas concentrations at that time can only be gained from an @entity12 ice core covering the last 1.5 million years ' such an ice core does not exist yet , but ice of that age should be in principle hidden in the @entity12 ice sheet			1
' a previous expedition in 2003 managed to extract ice 800,000 years old at a site called @entity66 , but professor @entity57 and colleagues hope to nearly double that in the near future			2
however , the deeper scientists drill into the ice , the more difficult it gets to retrieve an accurate sample			0
professor @entity57 explained : ' if the ice thickness is too high , the old ice at the bottom is getting so warm by geothermal heating that it is melted away			0
' this is what happens at @entity66 and limits its age to 800,000 years			0
' scientists are planning an expedition to @entity12 ( pictured ) in three to five year 's time			1
they are currently focusing on raising funding for the trip which could cost around £ 40million , and working out where to drill to collect the ice core furthermore , horizontal movement in the ice can cause the very bottom annual layers to mix up			1
in their search to find the ideal site , professor @entity57 and his team at the university , combined data to identify possible drill sites			0
@entity117 , co-author of the study which is published in @entity119 , of the @entity120 , said : ' to constrain the possible locations where such 1.5 million - year old - and in terms of its layering undisturbed - ice could be found in @entity12 , we compiled the available data on climate and ice conditions in the @entity12 and used a simple ice and heat flow model to locate larger areas where such old ice may exist			2
' the team plan to survey the sites on the ground before choosing their deep drill location			0
professor @entity57 said : ' a deep drilling project in @entity12 could commence within the next 3 - 5 years			0
' this time would also be needed to plan the drilling logistically and create the funding for such an exciting large - scale international research project , which would cost around 50 million euros			2

scientists from @entity33 , @entity9 , are planning an expedition to @entity12 for three to five year 's time that could cost around £ 40million
researchers plan to extra an ice core between 2.4 and three km long from the @entity12 ice shelf to examine the @entity6 's ancient climate
they hope the giant experiment will reveal why the @entity6 ’s atmosphere underwent a transition roughly one million years ago
