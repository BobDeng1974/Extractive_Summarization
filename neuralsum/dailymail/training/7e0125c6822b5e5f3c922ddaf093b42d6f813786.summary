by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 20:56 est , 30 october 2013 the most closely guarded , high - stakes secret in @entity3 retail — what on earth @entity4 has come up with for its @entity8 ad campaign — can today be revealed			2
but can it top last year ’s offering , which starred a dancing @entity12 , the little boy with @entity13 , without being naff or cheesy ? will it shift those all - important @entity16 dresses , cashmere sweaters and mince pies ? has it any chance of beating the annual offering from its nemesis , @entity22 ? in the @entity29 advert , model @entity26 , in a check collection sweater under a @entity25 coat , gives chase to her runaway dog oops ! falling down a rabbit hole , she loses her clothes			1
luckily , @entity26 is in her own label for @entity37 silk and lace undies and can it redeem the brand after the humourless ‘ leading ladies ’ autumn campaign , which saw the likes of artist @entity45 and pop starlet @entity46 in the brand ’s finest ? well , i have had a sneak preview of the advert , leaked to the @entity51 from an insider on the set , and the answer to all of these questions appears to be : yes			1
the ad will be unveiled to the @entity57 in a gala screening tomorrow night ( yes , @entity29 ads are now that important ) , and will be screened on prime - time @entity60 on november 6			1
it has an all - @entity3 cast , including @entity4 golden girl @entity26 and male model of the moment @entity65 , alongside @entity67 - winning actress @entity66 , in her first ever appearance for the brand			1
welcome to the @entity71 's tea party , hosted by model @entity65 in @entity73 @entity66 's @entity74 is in a black @entity4 coat with faux fur collar this time , i think @entity4 has done its homework , and pulled off quite a coup : while @entity66 is known for her rather eccentric style of bird ’s - nest hair and socks worn with flip - flops , of late she has become something of a fashion icon			1
post @entity87 , her wonderful portrayal on tv of @entity89 , and an appearance on the july cover of @entity92 , she has matured into not only a red carpet ambassador for @entity3 fashion , favouring @entity95 above all others , but a curvy , creamy , increasingly classic beauty			0
@entity66 is certainly a vast improvement on the iconic @entity3 women chosen for the autumn campaign — a motley crew of athletes , artists , actors and authors in a shoot by legendary @entity108 photographer @entity107 that was too glossy and too unattainable , with no fun or mischief at all			2
here , @entity111 makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that , although only two minutes long , cost many millions to produce			0
at the end of the ad , back in the real world , @entity111 reunites @entity26 with her dog the story — directed by @entity121 music video maestro @entity119 , who has made shorts for @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 — has a cinematic soundtrack			2
the narrative is as follows : @entity26 , gorgeous pillow - lipped creature that she is , clad in checked sweater , cream coat and black skinny jeans , emerges from her house in a very @entity134 , deserted @entity135 with her @entity136 ( @entity137 , he ’s gorgeous ! so much so that the store will be selling stuffed toys which look like the actor dog , @entity141 )			1
the dog then runs away , and disappears down a rabbit hole			0
@entity26 sets off in hot pursuit ( who knew she could squeeze down a tiny hole with those extravagant breasts ? )			2
and , losing her clothes on the way to reveal her underwear ( boys : there are two shots of @entity26 wearing very little indeed — she has never looked more beautiful ) , she enters a magical world of @entity155 , where the tea party is hosted by male model @entity65 , clad in immaculate @entity3 - manufactured menswear			1
@entity26 magically transforms into @entity158 ( sporting a gorgeous @entity37 red coat ) , then is transported on a magic carpet straight out of the @entity161 , and becomes @entity162 , all pigtails and cream cocktail dress , to enter the land of @entity166 off duty : @entity66 , pictured left with her @entity169 medal , and out and about in north @entity135 is known for a more eccentric style which is where a giant @entity66 comes in , as the wizard , which suits her down to the ground			1
‘ love those red shoes ! ’ she booms , in that famous , cut - glass voice			0
finally , @entity26 ( who knew she could act ! ) re-emerges into the real world to find that @entity111 , immaculate in a faux fur - trimmed black coat , has not only rescued her dog ( phew ! remember , an abused dog , shivering outside in a snow - covered kennel , did n’t work terribly well for @entity22 ) , but admires @entity26 ’s outfit as well			1
the product placement — dresses , dresses and more dresses — is perfect , and there is nothing cheesy about the production , apart from the @entity193 truckles at the tea party			0
it ’s fun , and , given the chemistry between @entity26 and @entity65 , super sexy			2
@entity26 is a reliable cash cow ( excuse the term ) for @entity4 , with her own - label lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store ’s history			2
and the chiselled features of @entity65 will keep mums , who will be the ones lugging those @entity207 and @entity208 carrier bags home , very happy indeed			0
wonderful : after her portrayal on tv of @entity89 , and an appearance on the july cover of @entity92 , @entity111 has matured into a red carpet ambassador for @entity3 fashion regal : @entity66 , who won an @entity67 for her performance in @entity87 , is a classy , unexpected ingredient in the advert , writes @entity0 and @entity66 ? teamed cleverly with @entity26 , she ’s a classy , unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to @entity221 , being neither too frumpy , nor too unattainable			1
she ’s a busy , likeable @entity135 mum in her late 40s who has n’t decamped to @entity223 or opted for cosmetic surgery , and proves that , with @entity4 ’s help , she scrubs up extremely well , giving us ordinary mortals big buckets of hope			0
the bigwigs at @entity4 ’ hq in @entity232 — ceo @entity233 , head of fashion @entity234 — are trembling in their shoes , anxious not only about how the ad will play to the press on tuesday night , but also what on earth @entity22 has up its merino wool sleeve			0
from my sneak preview , the ad is a triumph			0
but will other viewers agree ? for @entity4 ’s vocal shareholders , this can not just be a vanity project , an escape for a few moments into fantasy			0
it has to make those cash registers burst into song .			0

cast includes @entity66 and @entity26
advert inspired by @entity155 and @entity166
*commercial* will be screened on prime - time @entity60 on november 6
