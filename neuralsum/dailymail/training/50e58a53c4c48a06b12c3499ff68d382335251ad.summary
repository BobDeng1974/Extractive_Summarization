@entity0 was 16 months old when he suffered severe brain haemorrhaging after being shaken by @entity2 a baby who was shaken to death by his violent stepfather could still be alive today if it was n't for a host of ' catastrophic mistakes ' at a hospital , an independent report has found			1
@entity0 was 16 months old when he suffered severe brain haemorrhaging after being shaken by @entity2			1
the 32 - year - old from @entity11 was jailed for six - and - a - half year in december 2007 after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter at @entity13			2
the baby 's mother @entity14 , then aged 21 , also from @entity11 , admitted cruelty by neglect and was given a six - month suspended prison term			2
but an independent report ruled that there was a ' significant probability ' the little boy would not have died if an intervention had taken place			1
now @entity0 's biological father @entity25 , 31 , has said he hoped lessons had been learned as his son would ' probably still be alive ' if cared for properly by health professionals			1
just a week before his death , the report said that staff at @entity31 noticed bruising on @entity0 's arms a week before his death but failed to act			1
junior doctors and nurses who examined the toddler also believed he was being abused but a consultant paediatrician stopped them from alerting police and social workers , it said			0
the report listed a catalogue of errors by medics who treated him leading up to his death on june 30 , 2006			1
they included ' serious errors of judgement ' that may have led directly to further injury to @entity0 after his admission on june 21			2
it also found that the staff who raised concerns should have pursued those further , even though a senior colleague disagreed , that record keeping at the time was poor , inadequate and contained numerous omissions , and that the trust did not take ' appropriate action ' at the time to investigate thoroughly			2
@entity2 was jailed for six - and - a - half years in december 2007 after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter at @entity13			2
the baby 's mother @entity14 , then aged 21 , admitted cruelty by neglect and was given a six - month suspended prison term the little died following his transfer from @entity11 to the paediatric intensive care unit in @entity69 , @entity70 , when a bleed on the brain was diagnosed			2
he had been admitted a few days previously on june 21 , 2006 , where bruises were noted but no follow - up action was taken and he was discharged			0
he was then admitted to the hospital again on june 29 with a brain injury and died a day later			0
dr @entity80 was the head of the paediatric department at @entity31 at the time			0
he later acted as a whistleblower in the case and said he had tried to raise concerns over his death and a member of staff in the department			0
yesterday he said a number of medical staff had told a consultant who had seen @entity0 that the case needed to be referred to social services			1
but an independent report ruled that there was a ' significant probability ' the little boy would not have died if an intervention had taken place			1
now @entity0 's biological father @entity25 , 31 , has said he hoped lessons had been learned as his son would ' probably still be alive ' if cared for properly by health professionals he said : ' from day one it was quite clear an opportunity had been missed the previous week and this little boy had suspicious , unexplained bruising			1
' i have no doubt that if @entity0 had been referred to social services he would have survived			2
' mr @entity0 said he hoped the hospital had learned lessons			1
he said : ' in 2012 i learned from a senior doctor who had helped look after @entity0 in his final hours that he died following ' catastrophic mistakes ' in basic safeguarding at @entity31			1
' the hospital did not tell me anything about this			0
' i have learned from the report that if the hospital had cared for @entity0 properly he would probably still be alive			1
' i understand from the report that @entity0 was sent home where he met his death by a doctor against the advice of medical and nursing colleagues and against the child protection policy			1
' it is impossible for me to say how this makes me feel			0
it is all made worse by the fact that this has been kept from us for eight long years			0
' he should have been referred to social services			0
this would probably have saved his life			0
' the report is also clear that @entity0 's death was not investigated properly at the time or subsequently			1
' it is good to learn the truth at last			0
but the report leaves many questions in my mind unanswered			0
just a week before his death , the report said that staff at @entity149 noticed bruising on @entity0 's arms a week before his death but failed to act			1
junior doctors and nurses who examined the toddler also believed he was being abused but a consultant paediatrician stopped them from alerting police and social workers , it said ' the review has been unable to find out why i was not involved in the investigations into @entity0 's death			1
' nor why neither the hospital nor safeguarding board contacted me to tell me of their findings			0
' i hope that @entity31 will learn the lessons from this latest investigation and that no other family will lose a child because of such serious mistakes			0
' but if that does happen i hope the hospital will immediately put its hands up and admit it got it wrong			0
' covering things up for years only makes things worse			0
' mr @entity0 made a formal complaint about the inadequate care the youngster received and chief executive @entity179 agreed to commission the review , which was carried out by consultants @entity182			2
the hospital have now apologised and insisted improvements have been made , including how it works with other agencies			0
@entity187 said there were now new processes for ensuring that the information for a child is available in the medical records in the event of the same youngster being admitted			0
@entity179 , the trust 's chief executive said : ' we recognise that an apology alone is not sufficient and i hope that we have been able to demonstrate to mr @entity0 our commitment to act on what we have learnt from this review			1
