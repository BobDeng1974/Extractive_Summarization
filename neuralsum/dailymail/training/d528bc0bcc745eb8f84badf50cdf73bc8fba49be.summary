by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 10 january 2013 a @entity2 man is being sued by his neighbors for allegedly allowing his children to take drugs and have threesomes on the roof of their luxury apartment building			0
@entity9 , 73 , is accused of letting cannabis - fuelled parties take place in his one - bedroom flat when he is not around , leaving the entire @entity15 high - rise reeking of marijuana			1
but mr @entity9 has hit back saying that the lawsuit is racially motivated and targets his personal guests , as his children live miles away in a different state			1
sue for smell : the neighbors allege that mr @entity9 , who lives on the eight floor of this building on the @entity24 , allows his children to smoke cannabis and have sex on the roof when he is away ‘ my children are 40 years old and live in @entity33 , ’ the university psychology lecturer told the @entity29 , adding that the ‘ racist neighborhood ’ does not approve of his black friends			1
although management of the co-op owned high - rise received the lawsuit yesterday , the feud between mr @entity9 and his neighbors has been going on for years			1
‘ i opened my dishwasher on a clean load of dishes and the smell was overwhelming , ’ a neighbor wrote to management of the @entity24 building in january 2010 , blaming ‘ @entity9 ’s stepson ’			2
last january another complained : ‘ it is 10.45pm and my apartment smells like a party was going on … the stench of musty pot that is lingering in my closet is unbearable			0
’ the lawsuit also includes accusations of ‘ lewd behavior ’ after a woman , named in the lawsuit as ‘ @entity58 ’ , was caught on @entity59 going up to the roof terrace with two men after dark , which is prohibited by co-op rules			0
no to smoke : @entity64 say the cannabis smoke from the ' wild parties ' in mr @entity9 's one - bedroom flat has spread throughout the building into their homes - even into their dishwashers and closets mr @entity9 , who has lived in the building for 12 years , said he was aware that there had been complaints regarding his guests ‘ getting rowdy ’ , and admitted that his friends ‘ probably did have sex ’ on the roof , but that the issues have already been resolved			1
the board of the co-op building had voted for him to be kicked out of the flat in march , but after mr @entity9 promised that the wild parties would stop he was allowed to stay			2
‘ i think there ’s a racial issue here , ’ he told the paper , adding that his friends named in the suit are all african - american			0
‘ this is a very racist neighborhood			0
’ the co-op is seeking $ 15,000 in damages , plus payment from @entity95 for their legal bills .			0
