pictured : @entity1 ’s rumoured new girlfriend who was n't with him in @entity2 by @entity3 published : 16:11 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 16:52 est , 24 august 2012 prince @entity4 has summoned his youngest son for a heart - to - heart talk this weekend over his naked @entity2 romp			1
royal sources stressed that 27 - year - old prince @entity1 would not be getting a ‘ dressing down ’ but @entity4 was keen to discuss his concerns ‘ father to son ’			1
although they have already spoken over the phone , @entity1 will be asked to explain in person how he ended up playing a sleazy game of ‘ strip billiards ’ with a group of strangers in a hotel suite – some of whom then sold photographs of it to a @entity24 celebrity website			1
last night aides were still undecided whether to take the newspaper to the @entity47 – or even serve it with a personal writ – and were waiting to hear the thoughts of @entity4 and his son on the issue			2
it is not known where the meeting will take place – @entity57 , @entity58 or @entity59 , the @entity4 ’s private @entity61 residence			2
but @entity4 is currently on holiday at @entity63 , his @entity64 estate and there is a strong chance @entity1 may have to make the trip north			1
prince @entity68 will not be present at the meeting , though the brothers have spoken at length on the phone			2
the prince is said to be stunned by the scandal			0
@entity4 is understood to be ‘ frustrated and concerned ’ that , once again , @entity1 is news for all the wrong reasons			1
a @entity40 spokesman said : ‘ we are still considering all our options and will not be rushed on this			0
prince @entity1 is , of course , being consulted every step of the way			2
‘ we have always said that we believe very strongly the photos were taken on an entirely private occasion			0
we have also said that it is a matter for editors to decide what they should publish			2
’ sources close to the case say the palace is , in fact , livid over @entity35 ’s decision to publish the pictures , despite them having been viewed by millions on the internet			1
but senior aides feel they have to weigh up what they have to lose or gain by a public fight with the country ’s biggest selling daily newspaper			0
they are also understood to be extremely fearful that more photographs or accounts of the prince ’s seedy exploits in @entity2 will emerge			2
this lack of decisiveness is hugely at odds with their aggressive attempts to stop the pictures being published in the first place			0
scandal : prince @entity1 mingles with the ladies on his @entity2 holiday when he was pictured cavorting naked with women in a hotel on wednesday prince @entity4 ’s solicitors , @entity116 and @entity117 , wrote to the @entity47 asking them to make @entity119 ‘ fully aware ’ it believed there was no public interest in newspapers running the photographs and that to do so would be a ‘ clear breach ’ of media regulations			1
yesterday @entity127 , a @entity128 mp on the @entity129 , backed @entity35 ’s decision to publish , claiming there was a ‘ clear and demonstrable ’ public interest			1
threat : despite the @entity40 and prince @entity1 's lawyers saying that papers would breach @entity47 rules if they printed the naked photos , they are yet to complain about @entity35 's front page she told @entity142 ’s today programme : ‘ the @entity47 after the @entity143 really ought not to be in the business of collectively telling newspaper editors they ca n’t run a story and they should n’t use their best judgment			1
’ @entity148 , daughter of media mogul @entity149 , the @entity35 ’s owner , yesterday insisted newspapers should be able to publish material available widely online			1
she said : ‘ i feel bad for him , [ but ] we ’ve all seen the pictures online			0
if newspapers ca n’t participate , i think it asks questions about where print and online [ meet ]			0
’ but @entity161 chairman @entity160 said of @entity35 ’s decision : ‘ the fact that [ the photos ] happened is well known			1
how the public interest is served by doing this is not clear			0
’ the @entity47 has received more than 850 complaints from the public about @entity35 ’s decision to use the images			1
but it says that , because it is an issue of privacy , it is crucial to have a complaint from the prince himself in order to take action			0
@entity177 , of the @entity47 , said that if a formal complaint was made after publication , then the @entity47 would look at the case in detail , including case law			0
last night the storm grew over the role of @entity1 ’s police protection officers in the incident grew after @entity188 commissioner @entity187 appeared to have a change of heart			1
he initially dismissed the pictures as not an issue for the @entity188			0
but as it faced growing questions over the actions of two royal bodyguards who watched @entity1 being photographed , it emerged the commissioner has now taken a keen personal interest in the case			2
@entity1 's rumoured new girlfriend @entity198 posing in a bright pink wig , this is prince @entity1 ’s rumoured new girlfriend enjoying herself on holiday days before the naked photos scandal broke			1
@entity198 , 23 , the daughter of a sixties @entity204 , was last month revealed by the @entity205 as the latest blonde beauty to be romanced by the royal after they were pictured on a night out together			0
two weeks ago she flew out first class with the prince to @entity211 , sir @entity213 ’s private paradise in the @entity214 , to celebrate his son @entity215 ’s 27th birthday			0
willowy former @entity219 drama student @entity217 bears a close resemblance to several of @entity1 ’s former girlfriends , including long - term love @entity222 and summer fling @entity224			1
pictures from the @entity211 trip show her with the word ‘ @entity215 ’ and a heart written in body paint on her arm to mark the occasion			2
in one photo she can be seen cuddling one of her best friends , @entity236			0
in another she appears to be posing on the bow of a luxury cruiser with a group of similarly dressed pals			0
intriguingly , however , she does not appear to have gone on with @entity1 to @entity2 – which may account for the extent of the prince ’s unfettered behaviour			1
miss @entity198 was keeping a low profile yesterday as was her mother , four - times married and divorced @entity248 , a banking heiress and model who has five children with three of her husbands .			0

have already spoken over the phone but @entity4 is keen to talk in person
royal sources stress 27 - year - old prince will not be getting a ‘ dressing down ’
pair must decide how to handle the decision of @entity35 to publish pictures
