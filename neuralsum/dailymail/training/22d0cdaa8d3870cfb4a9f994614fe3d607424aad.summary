astronomers have discovered that @entity1 , the north star , is getting brighter			1
they say the star has suddenly reversed two decades of dimming			0
it is expanding at more than 100 times the rate they expected - and nobody is sure why			2
is @entity1 getting brighter ? stars appear to rotate around @entity1 , the north star , in this long exposure picture taken near the 4 - meter telescope dome at @entity12 near @entity13 , @entity14			1
the image is composed of 114 30 - second exposures of the night sky combined to make the equivalent of a nearly one hour exposure in which the earth 's rotation causes the stars to appear to move across the night sky			0
@entity1 , also known as the @entity24 , @entity25 or @entity24 , is the brightest star in the constellation @entity28			1
historically it has been used to guide travellers , and is very close to the north celestial pole , making it the current northern pole star			0
recent papers calculate the distance to @entity1 at about 434 light - years , although some suggest it may be 30 % closer which			1
a team led by @entity39 of @entity40 in @entity41 recalibrated historic measurements of @entity1 by @entity43 in 137 @entity44 , the @entity46 astronomer @entity45 in 964 @entity44 , and others			1
they investigated the fluctuations of the star over the course of several years , combing through historical records and utilising the @entity53			0
the team found that @entity1 is 2.5 times brighter today than in @entity43 's time , which they say is a remarkable rate of change			1
' if they are real , these changes are 100 times larger than predicted by current theories of stellar evolution , ' says @entity40 astronomer @entity62			0
the team 's data also hint that the star 's cyclic 4 - day variation in brightness , although still weak , is once again growing more robust -- but no one knows what 's driving these flutterings or how long they will last			0
@entity39 and his team began to research the star around the beginning of 2000 , when they found that the dropping brightness was on the rise again			1
pinpointing @entity1 : researchers say it is getting brighter far more quickly than they expected after reversing its dimming ' it was unexpected to find , ' @entity39 told @entity80			1
' it started increasing rather rapidly			0
' ' @entity1 is arguably the best - known star in the @entity84 , since it lies within a degree of the @entity86 , ' the researchers wrote			1
' for much of human history , @entity1 was highly regarded for its unchanging nature			1
' however , we now know that @entity1 is a @entity91 variable , undergoing ultra-low - amplitude pulsations			2
' thirty years ago , a paper in the @entity94 by @entity95 announced that the amplitude of these pulsations was diminishing			0
' this behavior was confirmed , and it was believed that soon enough @entity1 would no longer be a @entity91 variable			2
@entity101 above @entity102 , with @entity1 in the centre ' we started photometrically monitoring @entity1 in 1999 and discovered that the amplitude of pulsations had reached a minimum and was now , in fact , growing again			2
' it was while gathering historic photometry for the amplitude study that we noticed the published magnitudes of @entity1 were systematically fainter , the further back in time the data went			2
' this is an entirely unexpected behavior for a @entity91 variable , and one that we wanted to investigate further			0
@entity39 presented the results of his research in a poster session at the @entity117 meeting in @entity118 .			0

team found that @entity1 is 2.5 times brighter today than in @entity121
experts say find is ' entirely unexpected '
