it is 10 years to the day since @entity1 , an 18 - year - old tyro with the world at his feet , made his unforgettable debut for @entity5 in a @entity7 fixture with @entity8 at @entity9			1
many believed the £ 25.6m transfer fee would weigh heavily on @entity1 's young but stocky shoulders but he confounded the doubters with a stunning hat - trick in a 6 - 2 win			1
on the anniversary , we take a look back at how @entity1 's debut was reported by @entity20 at the time			1
@entity1 's scored a debut hat - trick for @entity5 in a @entity7 match with @entity8 a decade ago as he announced his arrival at @entity9 in remarkable fashion @entity26 united 6 fenerbahce 2 report by @entity27 at old @entity28 the shirt he wore at the end belonged to @entity8 but the fans who applauded on an enchanted @entity33 evening had already identified a legend in @entity5 red			1
@entity1 had arrived , and in some style			2
@entity9 witnessed something magical last night , an opening performance as memorable as any ever seen at their @entity9			0
not even sir @entity40 enjoyed a debut like this			0
two goals had marked his first league match as an 18 - year - old against , well , @entity46			2
@entity1 drills the ball home from outside the box for his second goal of the evening after 28 minutes @entity1 curled home a free - kick to complete his treble as @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 looked on the @entity5 fans rejoiced at @entity9 as their £ 25m signing made a stylish debut tuesday september 28 , 2004 @entity7 - @entity9 @entity5 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity57 ( @entity65 82 ) ; @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity56 ( @entity69 62 ) ; @entity1 , @entity70 ( @entity71 82 ) scorers : @entity56 7 ; @entity1 17 , 28 , 54 ; @entity70 78 ; @entity66 81 booked : @entity57 @entity8 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity73 ; @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 ( @entity78 62 ) ; @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 ; @entity83 ; @entity84 scorers : @entity81 47 , @entity82 60 booked : @entity80 man of the match : @entity1			1
referee : @entity89 ( @entity90 ) attendance : 67,128 the matchday programme sir @entity93 has dared to compare @entity1 to @entity94 but already that does not do him justice			2
@entity94 never excelled like this in the @entity7			0
this was @entity99 against @entity100 , @entity40 at @entity101			0
when @entity94 joined from @entity102 , he started as a substitute against @entity104			0
@entity5 were pleading poverty on the eve of this contest but they are richer for the £ 30million they agreed to pay @entity109 last month			1
they have @entity1 , as exciting a player @entity93 has seen in 30 years - and @entity5 have seen in 40			1
@entity111 said he was the only @entity112 player he would pay to watch and for the 67,000 fortunate enough to be here , @entity1 was certainly worth the admission fee			2
he did more than entertain them with his first professional hat - trick			1
he took them back to a glorious past and opened the door to a glittering future , leaving them spellbound in the process			0
three months out with a broken foot did nothing to lessen his impact			0
nor did the side @entity93 selected to play alongside him			0
@entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 occupied three of the four midfield places			2
imagine what @entity1 can achieve when he finally gets to line up with the real @entity5			1
against @entity8 he was magnificent , providing a dazzling demonstration of pace , power , poise and precision			2
as a passer and a predator , he was simply sensational			0
all three goals came from outside the penalty area			0
@entity70 provided the ammunition for his opening 17th - minute goal but after that @entity1 delivered on his own			1
a 22 - yard shot increased @entity5 's advantage			1
a 20 - yard freekick then followed			0
who needs @entity145 ? not @entity5			2
@entity1 even mimicked the @entity147 captain with a celebration that saw him run to the corner flag with his arms outstretched			2
no wonder @entity93 said this a footballer who does not require coaching			0
he needs nurturing , yes			0
but this is the boy , as @entity99 said last week , who has ' everything '			0
@entity5 line up before the match - ( back row , left to right ) @entity66 , @entity70 , @entity61 , @entity63 , @entity67 , @entity64 , @entity57 ; ( front row , left to right ) @entity68 , @entity1 , @entity55 , @entity56 @entity1 , wearing a @entity8 shirt , asks referee @entity89 for the match ball minutes played : 90 goals : 3 shots on target : 4 shots off target : 2 assists : 1 passes : 23 passing accuracy : 61 per cent fouls conceded : 2 fouls won : 3 @entity172 had seen this before , and against @entity175 opposition			1
he handed @entity1 his full competitive debut in last year 's @entity178 qualifier and the teenager responded with the game of his life			1
the game of his life , that is , until he met @entity183 , @entity184 and then @entity8			2
while @entity172 would have delighted in seeing @entity55 return to action and @entity63 take the captain 's armband , @entity1 wasted little time in proving himself ready for next month 's @entity189 encounters against @entity190 and @entity191 - but then @entity1 , it seems , is always ready			1
@entity5 opened the scoring when @entity195 @entity194 sent an accurate cross to @entity56 and the @entity197 headed past @entity73 with considerable aplomb			1
already @entity1 was sparkling - twisting , turning and running in a fashion defenders fear most			1
@entity70 cut through @entity8 's back line with a beautifully timed pass , and then looked on in admiration as @entity1 struck from just outside the area			1
@entity1 jumps on @entity70 after the @entity204 scored @entity5 's fifth goal of the night @entity1 sends the ball beyond @entity8 goalkeeper @entity73 for his first goal of the evening @entity5 manager sir @entity93 said afterwards : ' i do n't suppose i have seen a debut like it			1
' what you saw tonight is the reason why we signed him			0
and i think he can only get stronger now			0
we think the boy has great potential and it was a great performance and a great start by him			0
' @entity8 coach @entity219 was equally as enthusiastic , saying : ' maybe he will become the player of the century			2
' his second goal arrived in the 28th minute , and it was another trademark strike from a prodigious talent			0
a sidestep to escape the attention of @entity225 , the @entity8 captain , was followed by a blistering 22 - yard drive			2
' @entity1 , @entity1 , @entity1 , ' cried the fans			0
those who once hailed @entity228 as the @entity229 now have their @entity230			0
@entity8 reduced the deficit when @entity81 met a 47th - minute corner with a volley , but @entity1 's free - kick arrived seven minutes later and again @entity9 rose to its feet			1
there was a moment when he stumbled from the sublime to the ridiculous , a backpass that looked more like a shot resulting in a corner for @entity8 and another goal for the @entity175 champions from @entity82			0
but @entity70 scored in the 78th minute with an excellent finish , and @entity66 left @entity73 beaten for a sixth time after running on to a pass from - who else ? @entity1			1
the goals made @entity1 the youngest player to score a hat - trick in the @entity7 at 18 years and 335 days			1
he scored 17 goals in 43 appearances for @entity5 during his debut season but it was a campaign of disappointment for sir @entity93 's team			1
they finished a massive 18 points behind champions @entity261 in the @entity262 , ending up in third place , and were eliminated by @entity264 in the last 16 of the @entity7			0
the rest of @entity1 's career at @entity9 is , of course , pretty impressive			1
he now has 218 goals in 443 matches for the club and has won six @entity262 titles , three @entity273 , the @entity7 and the @entity274			0
