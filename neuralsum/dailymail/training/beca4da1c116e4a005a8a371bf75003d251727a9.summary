@entity2 's computer science graduate school tied for no 1 with @entity61 , @entity62 and the @entity63 in @entity65 's most recent rankings the university said in the erroneous messages that it accepts less than nine per cent of more 1,200 applicants - or about 100 people - into the master 's program each year			1
