they had saved for more than a year for their dream holiday			2
so the @entity3 family were devastated when one of their passports disappeared at check - in just minutes after they had handed it over – forcing them to abandon their £ 5,500 trip to @entity10			1
@entity3 , 54 , believes the check - in worker at @entity12 knocked the passport on to the baggage conveyor and that it disappeared into the maze of the airport ’s luggage system			1
mr @entity3 had spent 13 months planning the two - week trip and had booked tickets to theme parks including @entity32 for himself and his wife @entity33 , 49 , their 28 - year - old son @entity35 , grandson @entity37 , eight , and mrs @entity39 ’s retired parents @entity40 and @entity41 , who are 74 and 73			1
he said : ‘ we are just gutted			0
i do n’t know when we will get to go back now as it is not just the money from the flights we have lost , it is the rest of the trip too			0
’ mr @entity3 , a council worker , said he feared that it was the family ’s last chance to go away together because his father - in - law ’s health is deteriorating			1
' sorry ' : @entity53 says it will contact the family and offer a gesture of goodwill he added that he was furious about the reaction of @entity53 , which was operating the flight , claiming the family is yet to receive an apology			1
‘ we are annoyed at the way they have gone about it , ’ he said			0
‘ they have told us they are investigating but we have n’t heard anything			0
they do n’t seem interested			0
‘ i was just flabbergasted at the attitude of the staff			0
i actually said to them : “ do you realise what we are losing here ? ” ’ the family , from @entity75 , @entity76 , had already shown all six of their passports at a minor security check when they arrived at the airport last monday			0
but when they handed over the documents at check - in , they were stunned when the worker said @entity35 ’s was missing			1
after they complained , the family were told that an employee of @entity91 , which runs the airport ’s baggage system , would carry out a ‘ thorough search ’			0
but mr @entity3 said this lasted for only two minutes			2
@entity39 's missing passport turned up on the baggage carousel in arrivals the next day when the passport could not be found , they were offered later flights if they could get an emergency passport , but mr @entity3 said it was impossible to get a new one in time			1
the @entity105 had to abandon the trip because they did not want to leave @entity35 , a civil engineer , behind , especially as it would leave @entity37 without his father			2
a spokesman for @entity53 said : ‘ we are sorry to hear about the disruption to the @entity113 ’ family travel plans following the loss of a passport at @entity12			2
‘ @entity53 will contact the customer to offer a gesture of goodwill			1
’ the @entity105 said they have yet to be contacted by the airline			0
@entity91 said : ‘ @entity53 is investigating what has happened in association with @entity91 , and when this is completed they will be in touch with the family			2

@entity3 said the family of six saved for over a year to *pay* for the trip
he says his son @entity35 's passport was lost by the airline 's check - in staff
they were offered a later flight but could not obtain a new passport in time
mr @entity3 says his family was left out of pocket *due* to the carrier 's *mistake*
@entity53 says it will contact the family and offer a gesture of goodwill
