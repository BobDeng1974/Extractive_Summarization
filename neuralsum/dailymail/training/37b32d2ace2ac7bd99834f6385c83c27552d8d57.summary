' scroll down to read the travel documents ' the best view over @entity4 ... even from the sauna ' : @entity1 was in the lap of luxury for one night , and taxpayers chipped in for millions no generic lodging : ' @entity28 ' is the creme - de - la - creme of @entity5 's four - star hotels @entity40 ? even the ordinary rooms at ' @entity28 ' include bubbly and walk - in ' rain ' showers ; imagine what the presidential suite is like ! it was during the @entity7 meeting that @entity1 insisted , during a joint press conference with @entity49 prime minister @entity48 , that he would make ' absolutely no apologies ' for his prisoner swap with the @entity52 , trading five of their most prized leaders for a single captive @entity57 soldier now accused of deserting his unit in @entity59			1
the @entity4 trip was planned with less advance notice than the @entity62 is accustomed to having , because the @entity7 summit was originally a ' @entity7 ' meeting scheduled for @entity65 , @entity66			2

' @entity102 , only $ 2.5 million ? ' a @entity105 @entity104 aide snarked when @entity106 told him the on - the - ground cost for @entity1 's latest @entity4 stay			1
' i suddenly feel all warm and fuzzy about the president having respect for taxpayers			1
' that same congressional staffer said in march that it was hard to believe ' nearly 1,000 people ' had to travel with the president for a routine diplomatic meeting			0
' are there really that many secret service agents and clipboard - holders ? ' he asked then			0
a search monday on @entity121 found that rooms at ' @entity28 ' in @entity4 can be had for £ 122 , or about $ 207 , per night on upcoming wednesdays , the same weekday @entity1 spent the night there			1
the presidential suite presumably costs far more			0
@entity126 : @entity1 , @entity48 , @entity127 , @entity128 and company gathered for a confab in @entity4 airfare not included : the $ 2.5 million travel tab for @entity4 does n't figure in the $ 228,000 hourly cost of operating @entity133 , seen here friday in @entity134 the @entity136 's superior rooms for ordinary travelers feature 46 - inch led tvs , private fridges with complimentary champagne and wine , and walk - in rain showers			1
