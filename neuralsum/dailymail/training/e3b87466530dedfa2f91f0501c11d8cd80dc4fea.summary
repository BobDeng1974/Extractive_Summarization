by @entity0 i want it all			1
somewhere hot , but not too hot			1
somewhere i can explore , with a room i never have to leave			1
somewhere with delicious local cuisine and international delicacies			1
i want a menu of activities , and a menu for the spa			1
somewhere brimming with culture , but only sometimes			1
and i do n’t like children			1
well , i do like children			2
but not on my holiday			2
in the past , my holiday experiences have included an array of sulking , strops and – very occasionally – compromise			2
this is the one time of year when i wish to do whatever i want , whenever i want			2
feeling blue : the @entity22 resort occupies a prime position on the north coast of the island so can @entity27 ’s @entity22 resorts save all my problems ? these are places designed for those who can not make up their mind – or for mixed groups with varying requirements ( it is not a prerequisite that guests must have a split - personality disorder and be utterly selfish			1
that ’s just me )			2
i have ventured to the original @entity22 resort , in @entity40			1
upon arrival , the champagne is free - flowing – although possibly only to distract guests from the snaking check - in queue			1
ah bubbles , they make annoying things more pleasant			2
come in and splash : the resort has six pools , meaning guests can take a dip at any moment they please i am inhaled into this alluring atmosphere in quite a different manner from that in which @entity56 airport spat me out			1
smooth , calm and – that check - in queue aside – organised			1
the lobby hall oozes opulence – marble pillars always do			2
there is , perhaps unsurprisingly , a @entity64 theme to the complex			1
there is an old - fashioned glamour about the place too			1
the staircases swoop and spiral , looping inwards down to the lower floors			2
the friendly receptionist hands over several bits and bobs , leaflets , key cards and the like			2
my favourite of these is the vip card to the private lounge , complete with wifi , waiter service for drinks and a distinct sense of dignity			2
check - in complete , i am led by one of the uniformed team , back out of the main entrance and to a building on the left			1
in front of me is a pool – one of six , lit up and glowing turquoise in the cool evening air			2
i wonder if children are allowed in that one			2
and here 's me , today : @entity0 enjoys a moment by the sea ( left ) ; the pretty harbour at nearby @entity56 ( right ) and if they are not , will i get told off for bombing in ? as i walk to the end of the corridor , i am growing nervous			1
so far , i have been taken in by the haze of pleasure			2
it is like my rational self has been clouded with the idea of warm bread rolls and genuine politeness			2
no - one is ever this relaxed before reaching their room on holiday			1
the sheets are going to be stained , and i ’ll be forced to fight each night with the tv remote , which will certainly have a mind of its own			2
and the shower will blast hot then cold , and never reach a plausible temperature			2
the key card works ! this is usually my first problem			2
a sense of space : rooms are generously proportioned , with sparkling sea views wait			0
there ’s something over in the corner , distracting me from the actual room			0
a foreign body ? it ca n’t be			0
it is ! my luggage ! it has arrived before me ! i focus on the room			0
the modern , slick living space has a chaise - longue , a flat - screen tv and an arrival platter of fruits and wine			1
it opens onto a balcony that looks over another pool , and the sea			0
there is a slight covering just in case a little shade is required			0
oh , and my favourite part – there is a small private pool up a few discreet steps			0
the bedroom is dreamy – as i ’m sure my sleep will be			0
there is another balcony off this ocean - front room			1
tomorrow i will wrap up in my fluffy robe and sit right here to watch the sunset			0
the beach is so quiet and the waters are waving			0
we ’ll see you soon , they say			0
i decide to go to the ( very ) detailed meeting for guests , which help them learn how to ‘ @entity22 ’			1
we are told the term is a concoction of two words			0
‘ sense ’ refers to the way in which the hotel has ( apparently ) been designed with the idea of enticing all five senses – smell , taste , hearing touch , sight – in mind			1
‘ @entity188 ’ is a @entity186 word that can loosely translate as having a ‘ sudden enlightenment ’			0
room for self - improvement : the resort appeals to all five of guests ' senses perhaps @entity27 have set their hopes a little high			1
they want me reach enlightenment while smelling aromas , tasting fabulous flavours , hearing sweet sounds , touching , erm , soft things , and seeing beauty			0
this seems a lot to ask of a simple holiday			0
but , ( wo ) manfully , i get to work			0
i follow my nose ( let us call this ‘ @entity210 ’ ) to the first of seven restaurants – the main dining room – for breakfast			0
i ogle the fresh fruit , pancake station and continental counter , but settle on a naughty pile of bacon and egg on toast			0
taste buds engaged ( sense two )			0
still deliberating on whether enlightenment will be more imminent if i sit by the beach in my kaftan or in the pool on a lilo , i notice the personal trainer talking to some of the hotel guests			1
i peruse the activity timetable			0
i could wake up for yoga every morning			0
well , i could try			0
it ’s certainly nice to have the option , is n’t it ? a spot of @entity237 could be the best way to reach enlightenment			0
i always have good ideas when upside down			0
as evening slides in , i decide to dally with elegance by having dinner at the a la carte restaurant			0
the food is fine - dining , with live music to set the mood			1
resident performers are on hand to sing and keep my ears happy ( @entity250 ) – in case i become bored of hearing the ocean waves ( unlikely )			0
in the lap of the ( @entity64 ) gods : @entity0 managed to rouse herself from her sun - lounger on occasion i find myself drawn to the spa			1
i do not fight this			0
my muscles are melted with marjoram and oils by a lovely lady whose fingers are made of magic			0
the massage soothes my skin ( @entity267 ) , and holds me somewhere between sleep and limbo … i think i fall asleep			0
oh well , at least i ’m rested for the night			0
i am donning my most goddess - like outfit and heading to a local taverna for some grub			1
and while i enjoy a gorgeous tomato omelette , tzatziki , meats , fried potato and cheese , i reflect on what @entity22 means			1
@entity27 do not just want to offer a nice hotel			1
they want it to be a perfect hotel , in a perfect setting , with perfection at every turn			1
the walk back to the hotel is filled with beautiful sights ( let us not forget about @entity291 ) – but my favourite thing to look at is the other guests			1
i do n’t think i see one tantrum all week			0
not even from the babies			0
apparently , there is a new @entity22 resort in @entity299			1
my sixth sense is telling me to start saving now			0
a seven - night stay at the @entity40 in october , on a full - board basis , costs from £ 492 per person ( based on two sharing ) , including flights and transfers – via @entity27 ( 0203 451 2688 ; www.thomson.co.uk ) .			1

the five - star @entity22 resort sits on the north coast of the @entity64 isle
the hotel is located just east of @entity56 , with full - board breaks available
