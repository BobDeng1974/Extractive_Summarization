in a first half of utter domination the home side went three goals ahead with only three shots on target , while @entity0 failed to muster a single one			1
already three points adrift of safety ahead of kick - off , @entity0 manager @entity12 knew how imperative it was to get something from this game			2

@entity21 wheels away in celebration after finding the bottom corner with a well - placed effort to make it 3 - 0 to @entity1 @entity21 gets his hot away just before @entity0 midfielder @entity25 can get a block in as @entity1 raced into a 3 - 0 first - half lead @entity21 heads towards team - mate @entity28 , who set up the goal with a brilliant run and pass @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity31 6 ; @entity21 7.5 , @entity32 7 , @entity33 7 , @entity34 7 ; @entity35 8.5 ( @entity36 57 6 ) , @entity37 7 , @entity38 7.5 , @entity39 8 ; @entity40 7 ( @entity41 55 6.5 ) ; @entity42 6.5 ( @entity43 80 )			1

click here to see more from @entity78 's match zone the first came after 21 minutes , @entity39 bursting down the left , easily past 19 - year - old right - back @entity53 , and sending a low ball across the box which @entity28 was able to slide in at the back post			1
he was almost split in two by the upright in the process , and was eventually substituted in the second half , given a standing ovation by the adoring @entity88 crowd for netting his first goal since making a permanent move back to south @entity91 in january			1
‘ if it meant colliding with the post , i had to get my goal , ’ said @entity35 , who had gingerly limped off , afterwards			0
‘ it will definitely hurt , but no pain , no gain			0
‘ we ’ve been talking all week about getting into the box so as soon as @entity39 got the ball i knew i had to get in there and get on the end of it			2
’ it took another 20 minutes for the second , @entity39 again simply out - pacing @entity53 down the left and crossing low again			1
this time goalkeeper @entity52 got a hand to the ball but could not divert it out of the path of @entity109 who finished into the open net			0
@entity112 unleashed a ferocious strike from 40 yards that found the top corner to pull a goal back for the visitors @entity58 ' effort dipped and swerved past @entity31 but it was too little too late for @entity0 , who fell to another away defeat @entity58 grabs the ball in a hurry as he makes his way back to the centre spot as @entity0 sense a late comeback @entity39 ’s relentless dismantling of teenager @entity53 was painful to watch , like a grown man putting a puppy into a sack and repeatedly kicking it			1
but he was afforded some respite , at least , for the third , just 60 seconds later this time			2
@entity1 probed down the other flank , @entity132 using skill to outwit a few @entity0 players before passing into @entity21 who took a touch before bending the ball through a flurry of players and bouncing agonisingly into the far left of goal			1
@entity53 , playing only his third game for @entity0 , was hooked at half - time , @entity54 coming in at centre - back and @entity56 moving to right - back to try to deal with @entity39 ’s threat			1
@entity0 manager @entity12 claimed it was due to injury			2
‘ @entity53 came off for no other reason that he ’s got a bad calf , ’ he said			0
‘ his calf stiffened up and it would n’t be fair to the boy to keep the boy on there hobbling			0
’ @entity21 is congratulated by team - mates @entity38 and @entity32 after firing @entity1 into an unassailable lead against @entity0 @entity38 doubled the home side 's lead five minutes before half - time after tapping @entity39 's low cross into an empty net @entity38 leaps to his feet in celebration as he heads towards the provider @entity39 as @entity1 took a firm a grip on proceedings midfielder @entity38 points to his shin with a smile on his face appearing to suggest the ball had n't gone in off his boot if @entity53 was the puppy of the side , his team - mates finally produced some bite in the second half , even if it was all too late			1
they finally got an effort on target , after 72 minutes			0
from who else but @entity179 ? the striker reached a cross first but could only direct at tame header down the middle which @entity1 goalkeeper @entity31 held			2
then , out of nowhere , they pulled one back in the final 10 minutes , with one of the strikes of the season			2
@entity112 picked the ball up in the middle of the park and took a touch before belting an effort over @entity31 and into the top left corner from 40 yards			0
with one minute remaining of the 90 he almost struck again , this time hitting a first - time drive from slightly to the right of goal , but @entity31 was alert and dived to push it wide			1
former @entity198 winger @entity35 slid in at the back post to turn home @entity39 's low cross to give @entity1 a first - half lead the 22 - year - old beat team - mate @entity40 and @entity0 full back @entity204 to poke the ball home from close range @entity35 's momentum took him and @entity40 crashing into the post as both @entity1 players required treatment @entity35 and @entity40 both lay on the floor in pain after colliding with the post before both players were able to continue @entity38 calls over to the bench for medical assistance as @entity1 's celebrations were cut short after taking the lead in the 21st minute palace manager @entity51 is targeting finishing above former club @entity220 , who he left in a shock move in december but has since reeled them to within reach			1
‘ i said to the players when i arrived to look above because if you look below there is anxiety and pressure , ’ @entity51 revealed			2
‘ you ca n't play like that			0
‘ you have to try to @entity220 , whoever is above us			0
we 're above @entity233 , that was a bit of goal for us			0
can we stay above them ? ’ but time is running out for @entity0 to stay in the league			2
‘ i ’m hoping nine games is enough , ’ @entity12 added			0
‘ that ’s all that i ’ve got , so we ’ll go for it as best we can			0
‘ they ’re still unified in what we ’re trying to do , and all we can do really is to keep fighting			0
’ even getting a stunning consolation goal flattered @entity0 at the final whistle and the fight is beginning to drain from them .			0
