when asked to rank organisations they believe have their interests at heart , religious institutions came out on top for a very modest 17 per cent of people – exactly the same as the omnipresent internet search engine			0
reason to celebrate : chief executive @entity17 's company @entity2 is as trusted as religious institutions and in a world where more people go shopping than to church on a sunday , it seems that many now place their faith in supermarkets , as the big chains such as @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 ’s were held up as most trustworthy by 19 per cent			1
uphill struggle : new archbishop of canterbury @entity33 will have to find a way to reconnect with the @entity37 public the figures may well alarm the new archbishop of @entity41 , @entity42 @entity33 , who faces an uphill struggle in reconnecting with the concerns of ordinary @entity37			1
the study asked more than 2,000 people to rank the top three institutions they trusted the most			0
overall , the @entity48 came out highest on 37 per cent , ahead of the police on 26 per cent and big charities on 21 per cent			1
as well as revealing which organisations the public relies on , the @entity54 report , published today , aimed to lift the lid on how the rising cost of living and economic crisis has imposed lifestyle changes – and it claims to reveal a nation in survival mode			0
it said : ‘ we are highly pessimistic about our economic future			0
most @entity37 – 73 per cent – envisage at least two more years of economic misery			2
within this , 11 per cent think it ’s permanent , 21 per cent believe it could last five to ten years and 41 per cent two to five years			0
’ but the report added : ‘ rather than being defeatist , in many ways the slump is bringing out @entity37 qualities last seen during @entity72 , such as prudence , self - reliance , self - confidence , personal responsibility , flexible attitudes to work and mobility and a greater interest in local communities			2

for public trust the church only ranked on a par with @entity2
@entity48 came out highest on 37 per cent , ahead of police on 26 per cent
