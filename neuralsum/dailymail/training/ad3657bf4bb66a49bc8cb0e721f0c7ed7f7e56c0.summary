the battle for space supremacy between @entity2 intensified today as @entity2 successfully launched a satellite into space from its own soil for the first time			1
it comes just weeks after after arch - rival @entity8 accomplished a similar feat to the surprise of the world			2

there was no immediate confirmation that the satellite was operating as intended			2
the launch is a culmination of years of efforts by @entity2 - @entity53 's fourth - largest economy - to advance its space program and cement its standing as a technology powerhouse whose semiconductors , smartphones and automobiles command global demand			1
@entity8 's long - range rocket program , in contrast , has generated international fears that it is getting closer to developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the @entity66 @entity2 's success comes amid increased tension on the @entity69 over @entity8 's threat to explode its third nuclear device			1
@entity72 is angry over tough new international sanctions over its december 12 rocket launch and has accused its rivals of applying double standards toward the two @entity79 ' space programs			0

the satellite launched by @entity82 is designed to analyse weather data , measure radiation in space , gauge distances on earth and test how effectively @entity14 - made devices installed on the satellite operate in space			0
rising tensions : @entity8 sparked fears it is getting closer to developing nuclear weapons after launching this long - range rocket to deliver a satellite into space for the first time last month fears spread : @entity14 protesters burn a mock rocket as police officers spray fire extinguishers during a rally in @entity82 denouncing @entity8 's rocket launch on december 12 @entity14 officials said it will help them develop more sophisticated satellites in the future			1
