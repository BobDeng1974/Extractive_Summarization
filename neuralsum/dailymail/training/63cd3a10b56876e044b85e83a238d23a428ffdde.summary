@entity1 boss @entity0 has revealed how he failed in a last - gasp bid to snatch @entity4 wonderkid @entity3 from under the nose of @entity6			1
but he believes it ’s still possible he could land his 16 - year - old former @entity9 protege on loan from the @entity12 champions			1
@entity3 joined the @entity14 giants on thursday in a £ 2.3million deal which could see him go on to earn a whopping £ 80,000 a week			1
while @entity0 has backed him to have a fantastic career in @entity6 , he ’s ready to offer him the chance to get some game time under his belt if he fails to break into @entity22 ’s first - team			1
@entity3 holds his shirt after being unveiled as a @entity6 player asked if he kept trying to land @entity3 until the final minutes of the @entity6 deal , @entity0 said : ‘ yes , i was speaking with him			1
i hoped to get him to @entity1 and i met him and his father and i talked with them			1
‘ i knew all the way that it was going to be hard			2
i did n’t put much into it			2
i just said to him that @entity1 was an option			1
that here , he would have a better chance to play			2
that this could be a between step to the biggest clubs			0
‘ i have a good relationship with @entity3 and his father and they called me up the day they chose @entity6			1
there ’s not many times in your life you get the option to go there so when you get the chance it ’s good			0
it ’s not going to ruin his career			0
@entity3 poses with @entity51 ( left ) and @entity52 after signing on thursday ‘ is there a chance i could get him on loan ? you never know in football			1
this could be possible , but we also want players that we own or can make money from of course			0
’ while the chance of @entity1 borrowing @entity12 football ’s hottest talent from one of the continent ’s biggest clubs seems fanciful , there is perhaps method in @entity0 ’s madness			1
one of the conditions @entity3 ’s father @entity73 has put in place with @entity6 is that his son does n’t play third - tier football next year			1
@entity3 grins after hearing a question during the press conference on thursday at the moment he will go straight into the @entity6 b - team for what is left of the season under the tutelage of @entity84			1
the idea is that he helps the @entity87 legend to promotion from one of @entity14 ’s regional third divisions			1
if the b - team go up then @entity3 will spend most of next season training with the first team but getting match practice with the b - side			2
if , however , @entity84 is unsuccessful and they remain in the third tier this could present an opportunity for @entity0 to take advantage of his close relationship with the player			2
the @entity1 manager insisted @entity3 is not the sort go off the rails after joining such a big club so young			2
‘ if i was asked to rate @entity3 ’s attitude from one to 100 , it is 100 , ’ he said			0
‘ he takes very quickly to each level he reaches			0
he ’s the guy who trains the most , he ’s very humble and very , very mature as a boy			0
he has the attitude to succeed and just loves playing football			0
‘ money is not the issue for him			0
in @entity4 , money is okay so that ’s not the biggest problem			0
‘ it ’s an exciting move and it ’s very hyped in @entity4			0
it ’s the biggest thing that ever happened			0
he ’s the first @entity4 player to join @entity6			2
i ’m happy for him			0
it ’s going to be so exciting to see how far he can reach			0

@entity120 will earn up to £ 80,000 a week at @entity6
