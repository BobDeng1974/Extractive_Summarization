they gather on the streets after dusk , ‘ making noise , dropping litter and being a nuisance ’			2
but the ever - expanding @entity7 community do n’t understand what the fuss is about			1
hanging around outside in the evening is part of their cultural tradition back home in eastern @entity14			2
but to former home secretary and @entity18 mp @entity16 and the residents of @entity20 in @entity18 , it ’s a serious problem that is damaging the quality of life in a once peaceful community			1
the residents are ‘ angry ’ and want the streets cleared			2
frustration ? this @entity7 local is patrolling the streets of @entity27 to help his community integrate better racial tension and fear of civil unrest is growing , and to make matters worse there are the first signs of vigilante action against the new @entity7 arrivals			1
some residents with strong views about their unwanted neighbours have begun patrolling the streets at night to ‘ gather evidence ’ of anti-social behaviour and possible criminal activity			2
in addition , the local @entity46 community association is running ‘ official ’ warden patrols between 8pm and 10pm every weekday with the intention of ‘ educating ’ the @entity7 population about ‘ how to behave in @entity52 ’			1
warning : @entity16 , former home secretary , warned that @entity7 migrants could cause riots several volunteers wearing luminous jackets accompany a @entity59 community worker who can speak their language , and politely tell the groups of men , women and children to go back indoors , pick up their litter and stop making a disturbance			1
an official ‘ dispersal order ’ has also been in place in recent months , giving police power to break - up street gatherings in @entity20 if they may cause ‘ harassment , alarm or distress			1
’ but so far there are few signs of the issue being resolved			2
@entity77 is a ‘ community cohesion worker ’ employed by the police commissioner who set up a new neighbourhood watch scheme this summer			2
she admitted there had been ‘ tension and frustration ’ in the community about the @entity7 issue , with some people becoming ‘ very outspoken ’ about the authorities ’ failure to deal with it			1
‘ i ’m sure people are very cross , ’ she said			2
‘ they see the area has been hit hard by the @entity91 opening its doors and this area has been swamped a bit			0
there ’s no doubt people are upset about it			0
’ the @entity7 population in @entity18 is said to be between 2,000 and 4,000 and growing			1
more than 1,000 @entity7 patients are registered to two gp practices alone			1
@entity102 , of the @entity103 , is heading the ‘ crackdown ’ to tackle the street problem and launched the warden patrols three months ago			0
she has also arranged weekly litter patrols by volunteers			0
she said : ‘ the residential streets here are narrow and can get quite full up when they gather outside			0
' you get groups of people making a noise on what used to be quiet streets and it causes a problem			0
' the general public have had enough and feel something must be done			0
we are working to try and integrate the @entity121 into the community and our way of life here			0
that ’s the best way forward			0
’ eviction : @entity128 officials evict immigrants from a derelict site in @entity131			0
despite raids such as this a report has found that just one in every 67 reports of illegal immigration result in a person being deported the problem was difficult because the @entity7 families are not doing anything illegal or criminal by talking in the street , she added			1
councillor @entity145 , who represents the area on the city council , said : ‘ people here have been very patient and very tolerant			0
but there is tension in the community			0
’ yesterday @entity7 families were wandering the streets around @entity20 , many children of school - age among them			1
none of the adults admitted to speaking @entity159			1
for the time being the problem appears to be under control			0
as the cold winter nights set in , fewer people have been gathering outside			0
but with many more @entity7 people likely to arrive in @entity20 in the months to come , it could be a very different story next summer			1
mistake : former home secretary @entity167 says 2004 decision to give migrants working rights ' messed up ' former home secretary @entity167 has admitted that throwing open @entity172 ’s borders to @entity174 migrants was a ‘ spectacular mistake ’			1
mr @entity167 said @entity177 ’s 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to @entity179 and migrants from other new @entity91 states was a ‘ well - intentioned policy we messed up ’			1
@entity16 's warning that the influx of @entity7 migrants into @entity172 risked causing riots reinforced the significance of mr @entity167 ’s admission			1
mr @entity167 said @entity177 failed to anticipate the scale of migration when eight former @entity193 bloc nations became @entity91 members , and @entity172 – almost alone in @entity14 – allowed the free movement of workers between countries			1
at the time , the government predicted up to 13,000 migrants would come to @entity172 each year			1
the actual total over nearly a decade was more than a million			0
virtually every other @entity91 state , apart from @entity201 and @entity202 , kept their jobs markets closed for the seven years permitted			0
in an article for the @entity207 , mr @entity167 – who is mp for @entity209 – admitted the forecasts were ‘ worthless ’			2
mr @entity167 said : ‘ one spectacular mistake in which i participated ( not alone ) was in lifting the transitional restrictions on the @entity174 states like @entity179 and @entity214 which joined the @entity91 in mid- 2004			1
‘ other existing @entity91 members , notably @entity216 and @entity217 , decided to stick to the general rule which prevented migrants from these new states from working until 2011			2
' but we thought that it would be good for @entity172 if these folk could come and work here from 2004			2
‘ thorough research by the @entity226 suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be “ relatively small , at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to 2010 ”			0
events proved these forecasts worthless			0
‘ net migration reached close to a quarter of a million at its peak in 2010			0
lots of red faces , mine included			0
