' he was feeding my daughter when he suddenly said " oh my god " , ' said the insurance worker			0
' he looked at the baby grow and noticed the trousers were covered in penises			0
' at first i thought it must just be a mistake , but i looked and there are lots of different ones all over it			0
unfortunate likeness : @entity5 , 23 , spotted the drawing of a penis in the image of a jumper ( above ) while he was feeding his twin baby daughters ' it just looks like the designer was having a laugh and no one spotted it			1
i was angry because it 's not the kind of thing you should be dressing a baby in			0
' next , which stocks hundreds of baby clothes , later admitted the drawing of a jumper had ended up looking like a penis because of a misprint			1
mr and mrs @entity75 had been given a packet of the baby grows as a present four months ago , but had only recently noticed the design flaw			1
they are now refusing to dress their twin daughters in them			2
' we are n't going to keep it and keep dressing the girls in it , ' said mrs @entity75			0
' i think what makes it all worse is that i have dressed two girls in it , not just that i put it on a baby			0
' the girls were wearing it for weeks before we noticed			0
we do n't tend to look in depth at the clothes			0
' we just thought it was a cute , nice baby grow with washing line with clothes and socks on it , but then we saw this			1
once you notice it , it is unmistakeable			0
' a spokesman for @entity0 said the offending design was pulled from shelves after they received another complaint about the item			2
in a statement , the store said : ' we were shocked by the image that ended up on one of our sleepsuits			2
' the offending part of the design started life as an upside down jumper with a neck binding and placket with buttons ( hanging on the washing line ) , but unfortunately has been over simplified by the printer and has unintentionally become something else			1
' this is an innocent mistake that had not been picked up in the approval process			0
as it was inappropriate we made the decision to withdraw this item from sale as soon as it was bought to our attention earlier this year			2
