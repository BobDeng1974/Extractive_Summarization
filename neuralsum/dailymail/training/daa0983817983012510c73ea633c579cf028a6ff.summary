it is a problem that affects some five million @entity1			2
but tinnitus – or at least the risk of developing it – could be tackled by drinking three or more coffees a day			2
the findings , from a study involving nearly 70,000 women , suggest caffeine may have a protective effect against the condition – a constant ringing in the ears that can drive some victims to suicide			1
decaffeinated coffee did not have the same benefit			2
pain : tinnitus is a crippling condition - but could be treated by drinking coffee , a controversial study suggests researchers in @entity24 who tracked coffee - drinking habits in middle - aged women found those who drank three to four cups a day were 15 per cent less likely to develop tinnitus and those on more than four cups were 20 per cent less at risk			1
the results , published in the @entity32 , are controversial because it was thought that too much caffeine made the ringing worse			1
but after a 2010 study found tinnitus sufferers who cut caffeine out of their diets saw no improvement , with some actually getting worse , scientists decided to look at whether the world ’s most widely - consumed stimulant might be beneficial			1
rock chick : there are fears loud music gigs could put young people 's hearing at risk @entity52 is caused by nerve damage in the inner ear			2
it can be caused by exposure to loud music , an ear infection or even a cold			0
the damage results in an abnormal stream of impulses that the brain interprets as constant sound			0
many of us suffer temporary tinnitus that lasts no more than a few hours , often from a cold or from going to a loud concert			0
but for around one in 100 people , it becomes a long - term affliction			0
experts fear growing numbers of younger people are being affected , due to a gradual rise in noise levels generally and the use of earphones at high volumes			0
there is no cure but treatments include counselling and relaxation techniques			1
this is where patients listen to background noise , such as gentle music , waves crashing on a shore or even the hum of traffic , to distract their attention away from the tinnitus			0
in 2010 rock fan @entity96 , from south - east @entity98 , stabbed himself to death after he suffered months of constant ringing in his ears from attending a concert by the band @entity103			0
the married father - of - two , who was 52 when he died , died after repeated unsuccessful attempts to get treatment			0
experts at the @entity108 and at @entity109 came up with their theory after analysing data from one of the world ’s biggest studies into women ’s health			1
puzzling : researchers admitted they are baffled by how caffeine might prevent tinnitus , but said it may have something to do with how the stimulant affects delicate hair cells in the inner ear the @entity124 detailed the health and lifestyle habits of more than 65,000 nurses in the @entity128			1
all were aged between 30 and 44 at the beginning of the study			2
over 18 years , more than 5,000 went on to develop tinnitus			1
researchers admitted they are baffled by how caffeine might prevent tinnitus but said it may have something to do with how the stimulant affects delicate hair cells in the inner ear			1
they said further research is also needed before doctors can recommend increasing caffeine intake and to confirm that men may benefit in the same way as women			1
in a report on their findings they said : ‘ higher caffeine intake was associated with a reduced risk of tinnitus			0
‘ the majority - approximately 70 per cent – of caffeine intake was from coffee consumption but we did not find an association with decaffeinated coffee			0
‘ this suggests it is caffeine rather than another component of coffee that was associated with a decreased incidence of tinnitus			0

researchers baffled because the stimulant was thought to make it worse
doctors warn further tests are needed before it can be claimed as a cure
study tested almost 70,000 women in @entity24 over a period of 18 years
