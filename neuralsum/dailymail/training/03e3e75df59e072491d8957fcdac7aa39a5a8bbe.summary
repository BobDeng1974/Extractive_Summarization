@entity0 tried to show his wife he was a dab hand at chores but ended up mistaking the iron for a telephone and burning his face it is a saying men have been trying - and failing - to shake off for centuries			1
and husband @entity10 proved the age - old complaint still stands - men simply ca n't multitask			1
mr @entity0 was determined to show his other half he was able to juggle several jobs at once when he accidentally ironed his face after mistaking it for the telephone			2
@entity10 - from @entity17 , @entity18 - wanted to show his wife @entity19 that he was a dab hand at chores around the home			1
he said : ' i decided to do the ironing while she was out at work , just to prove a point			2
' she always complained at me for not doing the housework so i thought i would do the ironing to save her a job and prove to her that i 'm not as useless around the house as she thinks			1
' women are always going on about multi-tasking , so i set up the iron , opened a beer and put the boxing on the telly , ' he added			2
' it all started out well and i was beginning to think it was n't that difficult at all			0
i put up the ironing board in front of the television and started ironing my shirts			1
the first few went ok			0
but @entity10 , 32 , added : ' @entity47 was , i then got so involved in the boxing that i was n't really thinking about what i was doing			1
' so when the phone rang i picked up the iron by mistake and pressed it to my ear			1
' i really do n't know how i could make such a silly mistake			0
but i guess it proves men are not able to multitask as well as many women can			2
' my wife always watches the soaps when she does the ironing and never has any problems			1
' but @entity0 added insult to injury when he sprinted to put cold water on the burn - and ran straight into the bathroom door			0
@entity0 from @entity18 proved the age - old complaint that men ca n't multitask by failing to juggle several tasks at once ' that gave me a black eye so now i look more like i 've been in a boxing match instead of just watching one , ' he added			2
' the pain was incredible			0
it has also been quite embarrassing to tell everyone how the accident happened , but most people have been very understanding but many of my friends find the whole thing very funny			0
' i really do n't know how it happened			0
i was just so engrossed in the television			0
' doctors say he will make a full recovery from the burns - but @entity10 says he 's off housework for ever			1
' it 's harder than it looks			0
i really respect what my wife does now , ' he said .			0
