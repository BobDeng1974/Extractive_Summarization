@entity0 scored the first goal of the new @entity3 season as @entity4 and @entity5 served up a friday night appetiser that augurs well for the next nine months			1
@entity0 , who had failed to score in 10 games as @entity5 slipped out of the @entity9 last season , showed the @entity10 should be more to his liking when he was given time and space to put away an 18th minute header			1
but to prove to @entity15 and his demanding owner @entity16 that the second tier will not be a cakewalk for their pre-season promotion favourites , @entity4 deservedly hit back through @entity22 international @entity21 after @entity23 had been robbed by @entity24			1
subs not used : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 manager : @entity15 6 referee : @entity77 ( @entity78 ) 7 attendance : 15,625			2
though the quality was n’t @entity80 - standard – @entity21 ’s swerving strike excepted - there was enough commitment and attacking ambition to make the 15,000 fans inside @entity86 glad that competitive domestic football is back			2
with the pressure on @entity15 after relegation , he was the happier manager even though his side were left hanging on for periods of the second half			2
‘ we proved we ’ve got the characters to deal with these games , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve gone away from home and dug out a result , i thought our attitude was spot - on			0
we could have gone gung - ho but did n’t , and earned a point that may be important in may			0
‘ we ’ve got players like @entity59 who enjoy defending , they like heading the ball away			0
’ @entity5 have already lost @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 this summer with @entity107 @entity80 star @entity106 absent on friday ahead of an expected £ 8million move to @entity109			1
they did receive an early stroke of luck after 70 seconds when referee @entity77 gave @entity4 a free - kick instead of a penalty after @entity59 had handled inside the box			1
but the visitors took advantage of their good fortune when @entity59 flicked on a @entity23 free - kick after 18 minutes and @entity0 headed in only his second goal since joining the club from @entity35 in january			1
technique : @entity21 levelled the scores for @entity4 with a well - taken strike from long range proving a point : @entity4 midfielder @entity21 is mobbed by his team - mates after his first - half finish fiery encounter : the opening match of the @entity10 season had its fair share of meaty challenges the big @entity134 , who missed the start of pre-season to deal with a family issue back home , celebrated with his trademark backflip and @entity15 knows he will need him firing this season			1
‘ @entity0 has worked really hard			2
he came in a few weeks late because he ’s had personal challenges but really come on , ’ said the @entity143 manager			0
to @entity4 ’s credit , they bounced back well after falling behind			2
their reward arrived after 40 minutes when @entity24 , not renowned for his tigerish tackling , caught @entity23 napping and @entity21 crashed home the loose ball with a left - foot finish that swerved away from @entity52			1
the second half was largely @entity4 and their manager @entity25 claimed : ‘ i thought we deserved a bit more from the game			1
‘ we had a lot of the ball against a team that has just come down from the @entity9 and scored an outstanding goal			0
the lad ( @entity160 ) is a great technician and has a fantastic left foot			0
’ let the games begin : @entity5 boss @entity15 , left , and @entity4 manager @entity25 , right different league : @entity15 oversaw a 1 - 1 draw in his first @entity10 match against @entity4 @entity47 , one of two former @entity5 players in the @entity4 line - up along with the impressive @entity46 , had @entity4 ’s best chances but miscued with an overhead kick and then sent a header over with @entity52 stranded			1
on the downside , a back injury to @entity41 leaves @entity25 short of bodies at the back			0
‘ i ’ll need to have a word with the people upstairs , ’ he said			0
@entity15 has already done the majority of his transfer business but will need an extra defender when @entity106 leaves			0
only one of his six summer recruits , forward @entity184 , started on friday night			0
the man dubbed the baby - face assassin at @entity187 knows his team will have to be tough this season			2
he was secretly pleased by one robust tackle made in the second half by the normally - silky @entity23			1
" @entity193 " football is back			0
devoted : a @entity5 fan looks on during the @entity10 game between @entity4 and his side at @entity86 flocking to the park : @entity4 fans make their way to @entity86 before kick - off on friday evening glued to the action : a young @entity4 fans watches on as her side grabbed a point in opening game of season saluting the fans : @entity5 's @entity143 coach applauds the away fans that travelled to @entity86			1

@entity0 put @entity5 ahead with a free header in the first half
@entity23 's set pieces were *troublesome* for @entity4 early on
@entity4 equalised through a *brilliant* effort from @entity21
both sides go *top* of the @entity10 for at least 19 hours
@entity4 and @entity5 are favourites to challenge for promotion this season
