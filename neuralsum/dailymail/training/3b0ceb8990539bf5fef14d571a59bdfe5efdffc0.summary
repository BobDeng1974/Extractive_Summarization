by @entity0 in @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 despite being someone who has won the championship eight times , @entity3 has never enjoyed an unconditional love affair with the @entity8 or the @entity10 public			1
on monday , returning yet again to begin the defence of his title , he will find himself taking his bow on the secondary court @entity14 , with @entity16 and @entity18 champion @entity17 playing their matches on the main @entity10			1
the indications last night were that the @entity3 camp were none too impressed with the undisputed king of clay being treated in such a manner			1
back to his best ? @entity3 , watched by uncle @entity28 , practices at @entity10 before his title defence unloved : while @entity3 attracts the admiration of the @entity33 crowd he has never been completely accepted his public relations manager @entity34 gave an obvious clue to how the world number one was thinking when he tweeted : ' 3rd in @entity14 tomorrow			1
what do you think ? ' while there is no unshakeable convention here as at @entity43 that a returning men ’s champion gets to kick off at an appointed hour on the equivalent of @entity47 , and it is not the end of the tennis world , some irritation is understandable			0
it is not that @entity16 or @entity17 have especially juicy opponents – although the latter needs to watch out against @entity53 – and women ’s champion @entity54 was put on @entity56 on sunday			1
@entity3 will have to wait his turn to tackle @entity59 @entity58 and it will add to the sense that not everyone would be unhappy if someone else won this year			2
all sport needs unpredictability and through his sustained brilliance on clay the @entity66 has sometimes turned this into a procession			0
for that reason the @entity1 crowd could hardly hide their delight in 2009 when he lost at this event to @entity77 , having been booed off court when he retired injured in late 2008 at the indoor @entity71 that happens each november			0
his uncle and coach @entity80 did not attempt to conceal his fury five years ago , calling them ‘ stupid ’ , among other things			2
the way of tennis crowds is often only to love a player when they are on the downslide			0
today ’s scheduling may add to the determination of his nephew to prove the doubters wrong over the next fortnight as , for the first time since the middle of the last decade , he comes here as many people ’s second favourite			0
made to wait : the defending champion will not being his campaign until after late on monday strong : @entity100 breezed through his first round match against @entity102 and says @entity3 is still the man to beat the world number one has lost three times on clay this year and looked well beaten in the recent @entity107 final before @entity108 succumbed to a back injury			1
he has talked of losing some of his ‘ inside power ’ and theories have abounded about the relative slippage in his results			2
some believe it to be a minor loss of confidence while in a recent interview with the @entity122 , former @entity120 @entity119 captain @entity118 suggested his footwork on the backhand may have marginally changed to protect his left knee			0
it was hard to agree with @entity100 – a comfortable opening day winner over @entity128 in straight sets – that @entity3 is ‘ probably where he wants to be ’ after losing to @entity16 in the @entity131 @entity18 final			1
betting against @entity3 in this event may well be foolhardy , although the bookies now make the @entity137 the marginal favourite for the title			1
@entity100 became unusually tetchy when asked if he considered the @entity66 was less fancied than @entity16			1
favourite : @entity16 goes into the tournament as favourite after beating @entity3 in @entity141 last week ' i do n’t know who is saying it , i definitely did n’t			1
it does n’t go week to week , you know			0
three weeks ago @entity16 could n’t play tennis anymore ( a reference to his brief wrist injury )			2
when he was injured it was ‘ everything is terrible , oh my @entity152 ’ , now everything is great			2
' @entity3 has played the matches he needs to play			2
he is the favourite , then @entity16 and then the rest			1
' few are rating @entity158 ’s chances especially highly , and he will have to wait until tuesday to play his first round , against @entity161 ’s @entity160			0
of the three @entity165 players in the singles qualifier @entity163 joins the fray on monday lunchtime after being slotted into the draw against the number seventeen seed @entity171			0
it is not much of a reward for coming through the qualifying , neither a glamour tie nor against an especially vulnerable opponent			0
@entity171 is a hugely tough and consistent competitor who rarely loses to players ranked much below him , and it will require a career - best performance from world number @entity181 to topple him			0
but the @entity165 number three is in good form and has nothing to lose , playing with house money			0

defending champion will not start on court @entity188
bookies have @entity16 marginal favourite for title after @entity141 win
but @entity100 says @entity3 is ‘ probably where he wants to be ’
