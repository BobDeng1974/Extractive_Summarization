former @entity0 actress @entity0 burst into tears outside of a @entity3 federal courthouse wednesday after losing her 11th - hour legal bid to keep her two children in the @entity6 @entity7 , 45 , has been locked in a battle to prevent her son and daughter from being sent back to @entity11 , where they live with her ex-husband , @entity13			1
the children are scheduled to get on a plane to return to their father next tuesday			2
following the hearing , @entity0 was seen sobbing in reaction to the ruling			0
' my own country wo n't save my children , and i pay taxes ! ' she exclaimed outside the courthouse , according to @entity43			0
@entity7 , however , still has one more chance to keep her children in the country			0
the federal judge assigned to the case scheduled a conference call friday with the actress , her ex-husband and his attorney to try and work out a way for mr @entity13 to live in the @entity6 @entity13 , who is a @entity53 citizen residing in @entity11 , was deported from the @entity6 over allegations of visa fraud			1
if this final effort fails , @entity7 ’s children will be put on a plane en route to @entity11 next tuesday			2
after the emotional court hearing , @entity7 complained that her children , 7 - year - old @entity61 and 5 - year - old @entity62 , who are @entity6 citizens , are being essentially deported from their home country while she is being forced to pay taxes to support the parents of children ' who illegally crossed our borders , ' according to @entity71			1
she added that something like this could have never happened anywhere else , especially not in @entity53			0
bittersweet : @entity0 's two children have been spending their summer vacation with mom in @entity79			1
but they are supposed to return to their father @entity80 next tuesday			0
@entity0 had petitioned the federal government to allow the children to stay in the @entity6 claiming they had been deported to @entity11 illegally in the first place judge @entity85 responded to @entity7 ’s claims by stating that her son and daughter are not being deported in the official sense , meaning that their constitutional rights are not being violated , @entity84 reported			1
meanwhile , @entity92 revealed wednesday evening that the former @entity93 star could face kidnapping charges if she fails to return her two children to their father as required under the 2012 custody decision			0
@entity13 's legal team is said to be furious at @entity7 and her continued machinations to keep her children in the @entity6 - especially in light of the fact that the father of two allegedly paid for his ex-wife ’s trips to @entity11			1
@entity7 's efforts were dealt a blow by a memorandum handed down yesterday by attorney general @entity108 and director of homeland security @entity109			2
they slapped down the @entity93 star 's august 5 petition , which claimed that the children had been illegally deported by a @entity32 court			1
they have been here with her on summer holiday			0
in its filing , the recommendation of @entity108 and @entity109 read , in part : the court should decline petitioners ’ request that the @entity6 take custody of them [ the children ] for the following reasons : ( 1 ) no subject matter jurisdiction exists over the @entity129 because the respondents have no mandatory duty to take custody of @entity133 ; ( 2 ) no subject matter jurisdiction exists because sovereign immunity bars the @entity121 from requiring the respondents to take custody of @entity133 ; ( 3 ) no subject matter jurisdiction exists because petitioners have not been deported and fail to raise a federal question			1
a @entity32 court ruled two years ago that the children should live in @entity11 with ex-husband @entity80			1
@entity143 , @entity7 's attorney , told @entity144 : ' @entity0 has no intention of violating the @entity32 judge 's order			1
heavyweights : @entity0 's high - powered legal team in her attempt to keep her children in the @entity6 includes @entity152 , @entity153 ' this is about @entity0 's children and their civil rights			1
this legal action is the only way for the children to enforce their rights as @entity6 citizens			0
' no person , especially an @entity6 child , should be forced to leave the @entity6 unless a federal authority makes that decision in a manner consistent with the @entity166			0
' that did not happen with @entity0 's children and we are simply asking a federal authority to make a decision consistent with the children 's fundamental rights as @entity6			1
' the court documents seen by @entity144 are the latest twist in a bitter battle that has gone on since @entity7 , 45 , and @entity80 , 39 , a @entity53 businessman , divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage			0
it has left @entity7 emotionally exhausted , desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $ 2million in debt after spending all her earnings from @entity0 on legal fees and flights to @entity11 to see her children			1
@entity144 revealed last week that @entity7 had filed a lawsuit at the @entity121 of the @entity186 in @entity3 on behalf of herself and her children			0
she sued the @entity6 government , including attorney general holder and @entity109 , secretary of the @entity190 , because she claims that an earlier ruling by a @entity193 judge that her children should live in @entity11 was unlawful			1
only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation			0
she wanted the @entity198 in @entity79 court to grant her ‘ temporary emergency authority ’ over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was ‘ unconstitutional ’			2
marriage woes : @entity0 left @entity13 in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the @entity53 businessman 's visa was revoked			2
a judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 in strong language , @entity7 said it amounted to an ‘ illegal deportation ’			2
the lawsuit stated : ‘ emergency relief is necessary because the children are currently physically located in @entity79 , but they are required to return to @entity11 on august 19 , 2014 … ‘ ... the children are left with no option but to seek relief from this court because there is no alternative means by which they can obtain a legal remedy allowing them to remain in their own country ’			1
the lawsuit says the case is ‘ highly unusual ’ and raises the possibility of @entity7 breaking the law to ensure that her children stay in the @entity6			2
it states that children ’s ‘ only hope of obtaining relief from this court would be to have their mother retain them in the @entity6 , in violation of @entity32 order … ‘ ... such an option would deny the children a meaningful remedy and expose the mother and the children to unjust punishment ’			1
holding tight : @entity0 will be devastated if her children have to fly back to her ex on tuesday			0
she 's spent all her earning fighting the @entity32 custody order and flying to see them @entity7 has also demanded that steps be taken to see if @entity13 could be given a visa to enter the @entity6 to see his children			1
the only reason the current arrangements were decided as such was because he can not enter the @entity6 , allegedly because he lied to get a visa in the past			0
@entity7 , who played @entity259 's mother in @entity0 , has custody of her children 50 per cent of the time but they live and go to school in @entity11			1
but the real issue is the rancor between the two sides , which has never been resolved			0
according to court documents obtained by @entity43 , trust broke down between the pair so badly that @entity7 hired a private eye to spy on @entity13 ' in relation to certain issues regarding child custody and other matters '			2
soon after the birth of their daughter , who was born after they split , @entity13 put out a statement which said : ' i was never informed by @entity0 about the birth of our daughter , nor was i invited to attend			2
@entity0 films a scene from @entity0 with @entity259			0
@entity0 says she spent all her earnings trying to win back her children ' in fact , i found out about it through @entity290 reports like everyone else			0
although this sickens me , i am of course overjoyed that our baby was born healthy			0
' i would ’ve wanted nothing more than to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments , and i only seek to co-parent both our children responsibly and with love			0

federal judge @entity29 refused to step in to keep @entity7 's children in the country
the actress filed an emergency petition asking for a temporary restraining order to prevent her son and daughter from being sent back to @entity11
she claims a @entity32 judge deported her children illegally in 2012
the @entity32 court ruled @entity0 's ex-husband @entity13 could take the children to live in @entity11 and spend vacations with @entity0 in the @entity6
the children have been here with her for summer vacation and she is *loathe* to let them go
judge @entity85 scheduled a conference call with @entity13 and @entity7 friday to find a way for the father of two to return to @entity6
