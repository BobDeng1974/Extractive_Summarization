there she gave her now familiar midterm stump speech , in which she invoked her granddaughter @entity55 and encouraged the audience to back the reelection efforts of the top @entity15 on the ballot in @entity16 tomorrow if they want their children and grandchildren to have the opportunity to live out the @entity62			0
republicans , on the other hand , she said , are ' trying to instill fear			2
they ’re staking everything on it			2
' ' fear is the last resort of those who have run out of ideas and run out of hope , ' @entity39 added , according to the @entity73 , noting that @entity16 gov. @entity41 and @entity14 are ' fearless			1
' touting her support for female - friendly policies , @entity39 again claimed that ' women ’s rights , here at home and around the world , are like the canary in the mine '			1
' you start taking away , you start limiting women ’s rights , who ’s next ? ' she asked			0

a poll released today shows @entity4 leading @entity14 by a single digit , while another survey that came out this morning has @entity14 two points ahead of him @entity118 also disputed reports that the @entity39 spoke before a packed house			1
if just 700 people attended the event , that ' must have been disappointing , ' she told the @entity98 , because the @entity15 ' booked a space that could hold at least twice as many			0
' ' certainly i think that everybody in the community is surprised at the turnout , and it does n’t seem to have created quite the energy that maybe they had hoped for , ' she continued			0
' i would suggest that having @entity34 there is the next best thing to having @entity89 there			2
