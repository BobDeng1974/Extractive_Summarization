as star names from across the globe gear up for the glitzy @entity2 in @entity3 next month , spare a thought for the top names who have been left behind			1
there are only 23 men who can make up each country 's squad which has left international managers with plenty to ponder and some tough decisions to make			2
here , @entity14 takes a look at the best @entity2 snubbed xi.			0
. @entity17 ( @entity18 ) the @entity20 goalkeeper fell out of favour at @entity22 towards the end of their relegation campaign this season and it has cost him a place in @entity29 's side			1
@entity17 was first choice in between the sticks for @entity18 when @entity32 retired in 2010 and played in the last @entity2 and @entity33			2
despite winning 54 caps he was not even one of the four goalkeeper 's included in the preliminary 30 - man squad			0
difficult time of it : @entity17 did n't pull up any trees during his first season at relegated @entity22 @entity41 ( @entity42 ) the @entity44 right - back has paid for an inconsistent season with the @entity47 giants			1
he has won 56 caps for @entity42 and was part of the side to win the last three major international tournaments - @entity52 and 2012 , plus the last @entity2 in @entity53			1
but the former @entity55 defender made only 22 appearances for @entity44 and has not played for @entity42 since a friendly versus @entity58 in october last year			1
@entity59 ( @entity60 ) the @entity62 defender was left shocked by his omission , not even making it into @entity60 's provisional 30 - man squad			0
he played in @entity60 's most recent friendly against @entity42 and was involved in matches against @entity68 and @entity69 last november			2
@entity59 assumed he was a shoo - in for the team			0
left back at home : @entity59 ( left ) has been snubbed from @entity60 , while @entity41 is n't with @entity42 @entity72 ( @entity73 ) the centre - back is set to leave @entity75 after struggling for a regular starting place , which has meant he was overlooked for @entity79 's @entity2 squad			1
at 31 years old he will know time is ticking for him to regain some form to be considered for the national team again			0
@entity84 ( @entity73 ) @entity84 was the most high - profile omission from the @entity73 team and the toughest decision that @entity79 had to make			0
@entity89 defender @entity88 is set to start for @entity73 at the @entity2 and @entity79 opted for @entity91 's teenage sensation @entity90 to get big tournament experience			0
you 've not played enough ! @entity84 has struggled for games under new @entity96 manager @entity95 @entity97 ( @entity98 ) @entity98 manager @entity99 has divided opinion by leaving out @entity101 winner @entity97			1
deschamps decided he was a disruptive influence and would n't be happy on the bench , but @entity97 has notched up 50 appearances for club and country this campaign and won two cups			2
unbelievable ! @entity99 has caused uproar by not picking @entity97 in the @entity98 squad @entity112 ( @entity3 ) once the world 's most expensive player when he joined @entity44 from @entity115 for £ 55million , albeit only for a few days			1
injuries have blighted his career and he has failed to reproduce the kind of form which commanded that fee , since then returning to the @entity122 club on a free transfer			0
@entity124 ( @entity3 ) the tricky @entity125 has been outstanding for @entity55 and was one of the key players in their title charge this season			1
his stunning winner against @entity75 , curled into the bottom right corner , had many believing this was to be @entity55 's season			2
but stiff competition , particularly for attacking midfield players , meant he just missed out when @entity138 named his squad			0
@entity140 ( @entity3 ) @entity140 , arguably one of the most gifted players to take to the field , was left out after it was considered he was partying too much and not focusing enough on the game so close to the @entity2			1
@entity138 's assistant @entity146 said he ' lacked dedication and consistency ' to his international career			1
aged 34 , he has 33 goals in 97 appearances for @entity3 , won a @entity2 in 2002 , and has a glittering trophy cabinet , but this was a step too far			0
big surprise ! @entity124 has been overlooked by the host nation @entity3 despite impressing at @entity55 out : @entity140 going nowhere : @entity112 snub : @entity157 @entity158 ( @entity159 ) never far from controversy , the @entity161 striker , who scored 18 goals in his debut season for the title - winning side , told the @entity167 last month not to recall him to the national team because he had booked tickets to go to @entity170 with his family			1
they duly obliged , and @entity174 striker @entity173 was picked instead , meaning one of the best forwards in the world , in scintillating form , will not be at the tournament			0
@entity180 ( @entity60 ) a chequered history of fights and fall - outs with team - mates and managers did not stop @entity180 earning a big money move to @entity91 last summer			0
and he was a regular as @entity60 's number 9 since making his debut in 2011			0
in - different form for the south coast club , then another attack on a team - mate meant he moved to serie a champions @entity161 , but his return of three goals in 18 games has not impressed @entity60 manager @entity197			0
too much trouble ? @entity158 has n't been picked by @entity159 because of his effect on the dressing room one major flop : @entity180 failed to live up to his billing at @entity91 before a loan move to @entity161 @entity205 ' bench @entity206 ( @entity73 ) the @entity208 goalkeeper was left devastated after not only being relegated this season , despite being one of his club 's best performers , but then being left out of @entity79 's @entity213 would only have been back - up to @entity214 , but it was a harsh omission on a player who has been involved in every squad that he has been available for in the past two years			1
@entity218 ( @entity98 ) the @entity75 left - back was picked for @entity98 's previous @entity2 and @entity221 squads but days after helping his club win the title was told he was not going to @entity226 's @entity225 and @entity227 made the cut instead			1
looking ahead : @entity218 wo n't be involved for @entity98 as they look to win back the biggest prize on @entity231 not too slick : @entity159 have preferred @entity173 to @entity233 's mercurial @entity232 @entity234 ( @entity73 ) the centre - back pulled out of @entity73 's final @entity2 qualifiers after a meeting with @entity79 to discuss his long - term injury problems and has not been considered since then			1
@entity239 ( @entity159 ) a disappointing season at @entity241 meant the winger has not been included in @entity159 's star - studded squad			2
he was one of the most highly - rated players in football when he joined @entity241 from @entity247 for £ 25.7million but , often playing with a muscle problem , he has struggled to live up to that			0
@entity232 ( @entity159 ) the forward has failed to live up to his billing as one of the hottest young players in his teenage years			2
he was in @entity159 's last @entity2 squad , aged just 20 , but just two goals for @entity233 this season has cost him his place in the national team			2
standing by ! @entity260 striker @entity259 will only be called upon by @entity73 if they suffer injuries up front			0

@entity98 left @entity97 out , while no room for @entity232 with @entity159
@entity124 does n't make @entity3 despite form for @entity55
no @entity112 , @entity140 or @entity157 for @entity138 's side
@entity29 drops @entity17 after poor year at @entity22
@entity41 could win @entity271 but not in @entity42 team
