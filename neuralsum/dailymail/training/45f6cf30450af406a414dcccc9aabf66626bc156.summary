the @entity0 has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the @entity2			1
now , a new @entity4 study suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago			2
researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in @entity11 , which contain enough water to raise sea levels by at least a metre , may be irreversible			2
now , a new @entity4 study suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago the findings of the 21 - year study by @entity21 and the @entity22 , @entity24 claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the @entity27			1
scientists found the rate by taking radar , laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers ' mass between 1992 and 2013			1
they found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year ( 91.5 billion @entity4 tons ) , or the equivalent of losing the water weight of @entity37 every two years			1
' the mass loss of these glaciers is increasing at an amazing rate , ' said scientist @entity41 , jointly of the @entity42 and @entity21 's @entity43			1
' previous studies had suggested that this region is starting to change very dramatically since the 1990s , and we wanted to see how all the different techniques compared , ' added lead author @entity48 of @entity42			0
the study found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year ( 91.5 billion @entity4 tons ) , or the equivalent of losing the water weight of @entity37 ( pictured ) every two years ' the remarkable agreement among the techniques gave us confidence that we are getting this right			1
' the researchers reconciled measurements of the mass balance of glaciers flowing into the @entity27			0
mass balance is a measure of how much ice the glaciers gain and lose over time from accumulating or melting snow , discharges of ice as icebergs , and other causes			0
measurements from all four techniques were available from 2003 to 2009			0
combined , the four data sets span the years 1992 to 2013			1
the glaciers in the embayment lost mass throughout the entire period			2
the researchers calculated two separate quantities : the total amount of loss , and the changes in the rate of loss			0
it takes just 10 years for a single emission of carbon dioxide ( @entity84 ) to have its maximum warming effects on the @entity86 , according to a new study by the @entity88			1
pictured is the average global surface temperatures in 2013			1
red and dark orange show warmer - than - average temperatures many scientists believe it takes several decades for the effects of global warming to be felt on @entity86			1
but in fact , it takes just 10 years for a single emission of carbon dioxide ( @entity84 ) to have its maximum warming effects on the planet			0
this is according to @entity104 - based researchers who claim to have dispelled a common misconception that the damaging effects from a co2 emission will only be felt by future generations			2
the results suggest that warming can persist for more than a century and that the benefits from emission reductions will be felt by those who have worked to curb the emissions			0
some of these benefits would be the avoidance of extreme weather events , such as droughts , heatwaves and flooding , according to scientists at the @entity88			0
however , some of the bigger climate impacts from warming , such as sea - level rise , melting ice sheets and long - lasting damage to ecosystems , may not occur for hundreds or thousands of years later , they claim			1
' a lot of climate scientists may have an intuition about how long it takes to feel the warming from a particular emission of @entity84 , but that intuition might be a little bit out of sync with our best estimates from today 's climate and carbon cycle models , ' said lead author of the study dr @entity145			2
the rate of loss accelerated an average of 6.1 gigatons ( 6.7 billion @entity4 tons ) per year since 1992			1
from 2003 to 2009 , when all four observational techniques overlapped , the melt rate increased an average of 16.3 gigatons per year - almost three times the rate of increase for the full 21 - year period			1
the total amount of loss was close to the average at 84 gigatons			2
the scientists said that glacier and ice sheet behavior worldwide is by far the greatest uncertainty in predicting future sea level			0
' we have an excellent observing network now			0
it 's critical that we maintain this network to continue monitoring the changes , ' ms @entity41 said , ' because the changes are proceeding very fast			0
' the results were released as a global warming conference has begun in @entity171			0
those talks are seen as critical to reaching a multilateral accord next year in @entity174 the @entity0 is an arm of the @entity176 off @entity177 in western @entity11			0
the sea is mostly ice - covered , and the @entity179 protrudes into it			0

findings came from 21 - year study by @entity21 and @entity22
they claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of @entity2 melt
study combined radar , laser and satellite data between 1992 and 2013
it found @entity195 lost an average 83 gigatons per year
this is same as losing water weight of @entity37 every two years
