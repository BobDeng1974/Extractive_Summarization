@entity0 insists he will never be swayed by @entity2 ’s mind games because he has an ‘ iron shield ’ surrounding him			1
@entity4 manager @entity2 is renowned for making jibes at his opponents in a bid to ruffle their feathers			1
he has replaced sir @entity9 as the master of mind games in the @entity12 but may have met his match in former mentor @entity14 , who he faces at @entity15 on sunday			1
can anything get past it ? ‘ no , ’ said @entity14 , who was known in @entity30 as the ‘ @entity31 ’			0
he added : ‘ because i think everybody can write or speak about me — i can not change that — i have learnt not to react and believe in myself , my players , my staff and that is important			0
’ where @entity38 manager @entity37 and @entity40 boss @entity39 have reacted to @entity2 ’s comments over recent seasons , @entity14 was calm ahead of @entity16 ’s match against the league leaders on sunday			1
the @entity47 joked that he had only learned to shield himself from comments since coming to @entity49 three months ago			0
he was perhaps buoyed by @entity50 being ruled fit after recovering from a thigh injury picked up against @entity52			0
@entity2 may have his own injury boost because he revealed he is ready to risk top - scorer @entity54 , who has missed @entity4 ’s last two games with a hamstring problem and spent time in hospital this week after contracting a virus			1
@entity50 is fit for @entity16 's crunch match against @entity4 on sunday at @entity15 the £ 60million signing was struggling with a thigh injury picked up in their 2 - 2 draw at @entity52 @entity2 may have his own injury boost because he revealed he is ready to risk top - scorer @entity54 in terms of mind games , reputations have counted for little for @entity2 , who has targeted @entity37 , @entity39 and @entity68 manager @entity67			1
but @entity14 knows @entity2 better than most , having made him one of his assistants and most trusted coaches when he was in charge at @entity72 from 1997 to 2000			2
@entity2 used @entity72 , where he was first a translator under sir @entity74 and became his close confidant , as a launch - pad to success			2
@entity14 and @entity2 have remained close , although the pair have not met since he took over at @entity16			1
@entity2 , then - @entity80 manager , greets @entity14 , who was boss of @entity68 at the time @entity14 had nothing but kind words to say about @entity2 ahead of their clash at @entity15 on sunday @entity14 says @entity2 is ' a wonderful coach ' and that seeing him become a champion has been ' fantastic ' this will be only the second time they have come face - to - face as managers			2
their first was when @entity2 masterminded @entity80 ’s 2 - 0 @entity93 final win against a @entity68 side led by @entity14 in 2010			2
the @entity16 boss has said @entity2 is a better coach than him now , and on friday admitted his surprise that his counterpart has gone on to achieve so much			2
he believes @entity2 now poses the biggest challenge he has faced as a manager but is not fazed by it			0
@entity14 added : ‘ you have to analyse that i have started just three months ago and him longer			0
i ’ve said that before			0
so it ’s logical that he ’s further with his team than i am with @entity16			0
but nevertheless we can win against @entity4			0
’ @entity2 's @entity4 sit top of the @entity12 table after an unbeaten start to the new season @entity2 has kept the public guessing with updates on the fitness of star striker @entity54 in recent weeks			1

@entity0 says @entity2 's mind games will not work on him
' i ’m made from a little bit of iron so i have a shield , an iron shield , ' he says
