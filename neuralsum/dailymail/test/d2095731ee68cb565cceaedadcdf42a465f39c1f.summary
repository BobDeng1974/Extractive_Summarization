@entity0 and @entity1 could rematch in under six weeks after the pair reignited their war of words at a @entity7 press conference on thursday			1
the pair clashed in a memorable 12 - round grudge match on november 29 with @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity14 middleweight champions @entity12 handing his rival his first career defeat			2
now the duo are both set to fight at @entity18 on may 9 but not against each other			1
as it stands , @entity20 will be making the first defence of his @entity24 interim belt while @entity0 will have a warm - up ' international contest ' ahead of his challenge for the @entity28 middleweight title mooted for july			1
@entity0 and @entity1 were involved in a war of words during the press conference @entity0 shows his unbeaten record to @entity1 during a press conference @entity20 challenged @entity0 to take a re-match with him on may 9 @entity36 promoter @entity35 initially played down the chances of the pair fighting in may , but later said he would work on trying to get the fight on but this show has been scheduled in a bid to build up a rematch between them , with promoter @entity35 suggesting an autumn rematch			1
however they kicked off their verbal sparring in a fiery press conference and @entity20 challenged @entity0 to go straight ahead and fight him on may 9			1
and , despite having a guaranteed world title shot lined up against the winner of next week 's @entity52 clash between @entity55 v @entity53 , @entity0 took the bait			2
@entity0 said : ' you want to fight on may 9 ? i 'll tell you what we 'll do , @entity35 can double my purse for the world title and i will fight @entity1 no problem			1
it will be on my terms because i 've got the win			0
' @entity20 and @entity0 have had a long standing rivalry and @entity0 won when the pair met in november @entity35 , who was sat between them , was startled by the agreement and initially laughed it off			1
but afterwards the @entity36 promoter revealed he will now attempt to drive through a shock deal for an early rematch			0
however he does have concerns about staging the fight at @entity18 and may seek to make the fight at a bigger venue â€“ possibly even a football stadium if they are able to push the date back into the closed season			1
@entity35 said : ' listen , if i could get that on for may 9 , that would be on , i can assure you but we are limited by the fact it is @entity18			1
@entity0 is due to fight at @entity18 on may 9 on the same card as @entity1 @entity0 is keen to get back in the ring with @entity0 and get revenge for his professional defeat ' but when i leave this press conference you know what i will be working on and we will see how we go with it			1
' i want to see it again			0
it was an exciting fight and there is a genuine rivalry with them , it 's not done for show			0
' i think the next one will be electric			0
' the current plan for the 25 - year - old pair to meet in the autumn is a risky one as six months is a very long time in boxing			0
although unlikely , either man could lose on may 9 before @entity0 will face undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career against the winner of @entity112			2
@entity0 got the better of @entity20 over 12 rounds when the pair met back in november @entity20 and @entity0 are both keen on a re-match and while may 9 is a possibility an autumn fight is more realistic defeat for @entity0 or @entity20 before the rematch could damage the credibility of the fight and @entity35 knows it could be in everybody 's best interest to get the fight on as quickly as possible			1
he added : ' it is a long road to the rematch and that is why when i leave here i will be sharpening my pencil and having a look at [ doing the deal ]			0
@entity0 has said what he wants and now we will see where we get to			2
' @entity20 won the @entity24 interim world title by out - pointing @entity134 at the @entity135 in february and the @entity137 man has urged @entity0 to forget about his current route to the @entity28 title and instead concentrate on dethroning him			1
but @entity0 taunted his rival by saying the belt does not mean anything			2
@entity0 said : ' that 's not a world title			2
do you call that a world title yeah ? well you 're mad then			0
you 're deluded man , you must be on drugs			0
' take your little belt home and hold your trousers up with it because that is all it 's good for			0
you have n't got any good belts , i 've got the best belts			0
' would you even bother putting that on your mantelpiece ? you can show it to your grandkids when you 're older and lie to them			0
keep it , it 's rubbish			0
