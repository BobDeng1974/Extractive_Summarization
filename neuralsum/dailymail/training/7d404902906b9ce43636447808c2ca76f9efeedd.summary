by @entity0 @entity1 produced the fastest wheelchair mile in history — and has been tipped to go faster still by sir @entity4 , a man who knows a thing or two about milestones			1
sir @entity4 was at the top of @entity9 in @entity10 to present @entity1 with his medal after he had crossed the line outside @entity13 in 3min 7sec			1
that was two seconds faster than the time he set on the same route a year ago but short of the three - minute barrier he had targeted to mark the official 60th anniversary of the first sub-four - minute mile run by sir @entity4			2
record breaker : @entity1 recorded the fastest ever wheelchair mile in @entity21 on saturday ‘ it was wonderful to see him get so close , said sir @entity4			2
‘ i think he ’ll do it next year			0
’ @entity1 , who was also cheered on by @entity25 , duly retained his @entity28 men ’s wheelchair road mile title , beating @entity30 ’s @entity29 by 22 seconds , and vowed to be back next year to launch another attack on the three - minute barrier			1
‘ i gave it my best shot and i was n’t too far off , ’ said @entity1 , who clinched the fourth of his quartet of @entity35 gold medals when he won the wheelchair marathon on these same streets two years ago			0
agonising : @entity1 broke the world record but just failed to go under the three - minute mark in @entity21 ‘ it was such an honour to meet sir @entity4 and it would have been great to have broken three minutes in front of him			0
i ’ll be back next year to give it another go			0

four - time @entity35 gold medal *winner* crossed the line in 3min 7secs
sir @entity4 has tipped him to go even faster
beat @entity30 *'s* @entity29 to retain @entity55 *athletics* wheelchair road mile
