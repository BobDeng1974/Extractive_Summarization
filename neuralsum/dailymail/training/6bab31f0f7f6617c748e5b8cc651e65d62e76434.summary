the documents , which will go on show in @entity44 next week , are all original and were mostly created in the 1960s			1
the archive is being sold as a single lot and has been billed as one of the most important ever auctions of pop memorabilia			1
incredibly , it was only discovered by chance when a small company dealing in music promotion took part in a ' lucky dip ' blind auction at a lock - up facility in @entity3 , @entity39			1
it is believed the material had been placed there for safe - keeping by an associate of the band in the late 1970s and then simply forgotten about			0
its emergence led to a legal dispute which has since been settled after it was ruled it had been a ' fair find '			0
the surviving members of the @entity1 are aware of the sale			2
the archive is being sold by @entity83 auctioneers the @entity84 in a sealed bid auction			2
@entity86 , of the @entity84 , said : ' this archive is like the @entity89 career			2
it is so vast , it would take six months to catalogue			0
among the crate 's contents was the original studio arrangement for the @entity1 ' hit @entity94 ' it is the largest archive of modern musical history that will ever likely be offered for sale from a group of musicians and genius songwriters that influenced the world			1
' it covers 150 songs from the early development of the @entity1 to their comeback of 1976			0
' the majority of the songs include hand - written scores , publishing and copyright contracts and compositions for artist participation of drums , bass and strings			1
' there will never be an archive like this ever again			0

the archive was lost over the course of time and was really found by chance			0
' it was a blind storage unit sale and the items inside were listed as documents and books			1
' a small company of music promoters took a gamble on it and bought the contents for a few hundred pounds			2
' it did n't take them long to figure out what they had but it has taken some time to put a value on it			0
photographs , many unseen , show the @entity1 ' private side - here @entity32 is seen at the mixing desk the photos show the stars off - duty and relaxed - this image , dating back to the mid- 1960s , is of the band in @entity156 ' of course it is the @entity1 property and its discovery led to a protracted legal dispute which resulted in it being labelled a fair find			2
' @entity162 , the @entity1 official archivist , said : ' this historic collection presents a priceless look into the inner workings of this legendary group			0
' when these documents were created in the 1960s and ' 70s , there was no thought they would someday tell an important part of the story of one of the most impressive - not to mention lucrative - catalogues in the history of popular music			0
