by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:03 est , 2 february 2014 it 's a problem that blights towns across the country - postmen dropping rubber bands used to hold bundles of letters together on the streets			1
now one retired teacher has decided to take a stand - collecting 3,000 of them over three years to shame the @entity12			1
@entity13 noticed large numbers of rubber bands left on the streets near his home in @entity19 , near @entity20 , @entity21			1
the retired teacher soon realised the culprits were postal staff who dropped them as they sorted through bundles of letters for posting			2
@entity13 has spent three years picking up almost 3,000 rubber bands ( some pictured right ) dropped by postmen from his nearby streets since 2011 , mr @entity13 has been involved in a one - man crusade against the littering postmen - by collecting over 3,000 of the elastic bands			1
each year , mr @entity13 sends a large bundle of them back to the @entity12 for recycling - and to make a point about their antics			1
last year alone the grandfather collected more than 1,000 of the bands that are used by @entity12 to bundle deliveries			1
mr @entity13 , a former biology teacher at the presitigious @entity42 , said : ' it is my way of fighting back against the problem of litter - but i do wish the postmen would be a bit more careful with their elastic bands			1
' it is bad enough that we have a litter problem as it but noone expects one of the big culprits to be the @entity12			2
i keep picking up the elastic bands for them to use again but as fast as i do that , they 're being dropped on the streets again			0
the retired teacher first noticed the dumped bands when walking to church in 2011 ' i appreciate postmen have much bigger deliveries to make these days but littering the streets like this affects us all			1
sometimes the streets look an awful mess and the postmen and women should know better than to just drop their rubbish all over the place			0
' we all need to care more for our environment and show through example that we can all do our bit			0
i just think the @entity12 should do their bit too			0
' mr @entity13 said he began to notice the elastic bands on his regular one - mile walk to church and decided to start picking them up			2
he said : ' i do quite a lot of walking and i always notice how much litter is around			0
where i live , the church is about a mile away and i go three times a week and you see litter in the street like empty cans of soft drink , takeaway wrappers and such like			0
' then i noticed the number of rubber bands that were being left around the street			1
i knew instantly they were from the @entity12 because they were the distinctive red they use in deliveries			0
' obviously i ca n't pick up all the empty cans and takeaway wrappers but i thought picking up the elastic bands would be me doing my bit to tackle litter - and to make a point to the @entity12			1
every year mr @entity13 sends piles of the bands to @entity12 as an attempt to make a point about the antic lat year alone the grandfather picked up 1,000 rubber bands near to his home in @entity19 , @entity21 ' after a while i was amazed at how many i was collecting			1
with most litter you ca n't identify the people responsible for dropping it , but the elastic bands are clearly dropped by the @entity12			2
' i 've not got anything against the @entity12 but some of their staff do drop a lot of elastic bands			1
i find myself collecting them every time i leave the house and it is not my job to do that kind of thing			0
' i started it out of habit of wanting to keep things tidy but i was really surprised at how many i was finding			0
the other day for example i picked up five			0
as far as i know the bands are biodegradable but that would take years and they are so unsightly			0
' i am sure that @entity12 just think the council will sweep them up but that does n't happen			0
in my eccentricity i have been keeping a record of how many bands i 've collected			0
@entity12 said they recycle millions of bands every year and regularly remind staff not to drop them on the street ' last year it was 660grams , which is about 1,000			1
they year before it was 500g			0
i keep the bands in my study in a carrier bag and then at the end of the year i present them at the local sorting office - yet no - one from the @entity12 has ever even acknowledged it			1
' i know it 's an eccentric pastime but on the other hand we do have a litter problem in this country and this is my way of showing that we can all do our own little bit			0
' i decided to focus on the rubber bands because it was so obvious who was dropping them			2
i do n't go around picking up other litter , like sweet wrappers or takeaway packaging it would completely overwhelming			0
' mr @entity13 estimates he walks over 250 miles every year collecting the elastic bands			2
@entity168 , from environmental charity @entity166 , said : ' @entity13 is setting a fantastic example to everyone by showing that we can all do our bit to tackle the problem of litter that blights our streets			2
' over the years , the charity has encouraged @entity12 to play its part by getting its postal workers to keep hold of the bands			2
@entity12 spokesman @entity181 said : ' we regularly remind our postmen and women of the importance of avoiding litter and the benefits of re-using bands			1
' we re-use millions of rubber bands each year and the vast majority are recycled within delivery offices and mail centres			1

@entity13 first noticed the rubber bands left on the streets in 2011
since then has collected over 3,000 as part of a one - man crusade
sends large bundles of them back to @entity12 every year to make a point
@entity204 said they recycle millions of bands and regularly remind staff not to drop them on the street
