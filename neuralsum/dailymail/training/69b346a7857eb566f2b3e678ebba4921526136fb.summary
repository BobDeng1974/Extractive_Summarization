by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity3 security agents regularly spy illegally on phone calls , according to reports , which will embarrass president @entity7 , who has vocally criticsied the @entity8 @entity3 security agents regularly spy illegally on people 's phone calls , emails , and social media activity , intelligence sources confirmed today			1
revelations about the covert activities follow president @entity7 attacking @entity8 for its own espionage activities , and saying they should stop ' immediately '			1
@entity18 , the most famous and best respected newspaper in @entity3 , today carries a detailed report outlining the behaviour of the @entity21 , the country 's notoriously ruthless external intelligence agency			1
it says the @entity21 intercepts signals from computers and telephones - including foreign ones - to work out ' who is talking to whom '			1
such activity boils down to wiretapping , even though this is officially strictly forbidden following a number of scandals in the past			0
' all of our communications are spied on , ' says @entity18 's report , quoting unnamed intelligence sources , as well as remarks made publicly by intelligence officials			2
' emails , text messages , telephone records , access to @entity44 and @entity45 are then stored for years , ' it says			0
such activities are just like those carried out by the @entity48 , as described in documents leaked by former @entity48 worker @entity50			0
he confirmed that the @entity48 keeps vast amounts of @entity54 data under a programme called @entity56			0
it includes emails , chat room conversations and videos taken from sites run by giants like @entity44 and @entity63			0
the @entity8 government also gathers so - called ' metadata ' , noting the time , duration and numbers called - all listed by service providers like @entity70			2
the revelations will be an embarrassment to @entity3 , which has vocally criticised the @entity8 after the @entity50 leaks			1
@entity3 interior minister @entity73 today publicly dressed down the @entity8 at the @entity8 ambassador 's july 4 garden party , denouncing alleged @entity8 ' espionage ' of @entity3 and other countries			1
tensions between @entity3 and the @entity8 have been strained since former @entity48 worker @entity50 leaked documents suggesting @entity8 regularly spied on its @entity81 allies @entity73 was guest of honor at the fete hosted by ambassador @entity84 thursday			1
in a speech before hundreds of guests , he said that ' in the name of our friendship , we owe each other honesty			0
we must say things clearly , directly , frankly			0
' he said that president @entity7 's demand for clear and precise explanations about reports of @entity8 spying are justified because ' such practices , if proven , do not have their place between allies and partners			1
' @entity81 countries agreed wednesday that planned talks on free trade with the @entity8 must start in parallel with discussions on @entity48 surveillance			2
@entity3 's @entity21 has publicly always insisted that it works within the law , but its past activities have included the sinking of the @entity111 ecological protest boat in 1985			2
the operation against the @entity114 craft - which caused the death of a @entity119 activist - violated @entity117 neutrality and caused international outrage			0
@entity3 interior minister @entity73 publically dressed down @entity8 ambassador @entity84 during a july 4 garden party it was ordered by former @entity125 president @entity124 , who was himself linked with an illegal wiretapping cell within @entity3 itself			1
but @entity3 's national security commission has challenged @entity18 's report , saying that the only body that collects communications information was a security agency controlled by the prime minister 's office			1
earlier this week , president @entity7 threatened to block negotiations on transatlantic trade following revelations that the @entity8 spied on its allies			1
' we can not accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies , ' mr @entity7 said			0
' we ask that this immediately stop			0
there can be no negotiations or transactions in all areas until we have obtained these guarantees , for @entity3 but also for all of the @entity149 , for all partners of the @entity8			1
' the @entity21 revelations will now leave mr @entity7 looking , at best , incredibly naieve , and at worst extremely hypocritical			0
@entity3 's seven other intelligence services , including domestic secret services and customs and money - laundering watchdogs , have access to the @entity21 data , writes @entity18			2
@entity158 is said to have a similar spying programme on international phone and internet traffic , and is said to share personal information with the @entity8 @entity48			2
a spokesman for the @entity21 in @entity1 refused to comment directly on @entity18 's report .			0
