not proud : @entity0 has said @entity2 's detainees should have been legally designated as prisoners of war and held in @entity5 , or taken to @entity7 prisons if charged the @entity9 official in charge of @entity2 has admitted that if he had his time over , he would have argued that the notorious detention camp should never have been built			1
@entity0 , @entity7 ’s deputy assistant defence secretary for detainee affairs , told @entity13 in an exclusive interview that @entity2 ’s detainees should have been legally designated as prisoners of war and held in @entity5 , or if charged with crimes , taken to prisons in @entity7			1
mr @entity0 – who , after three and a half years in his job , last week announced he will be stepping down to take a private sector job in september – added that the best way for president @entity21 to close @entity2 would be to announce that the ‘ war ’ with @entity23 is over			1
under international law , this would end any justification for continuing to hold prisoners who had not been charged with crimes			2
@entity0 ’s words will be seen as explosive , because alone of senior officials who serve the @entity21 administration in this field now , he played a key role in creating @entity2 under @entity34			1
as a senior military lawyer from early 2002 to mid- 2003 , he designed the @entity2 ‘ military commissions ’ – special tribunals set up to try terrorist suspects			1
these have proved a dismal failure			0
their rules have repeatedly changed , and more than a decade after five men accused of plotting 9/11 were captured , their case is bogged down in pre-trial hearings which have no end in sight			0
mr @entity0 said that if he were advising the @entity34 administration now , ‘ i would argue that detainees should be kept in @entity5 , or , if moving them is necessary , then into the @entity7			1
if i could change one thing in @entity2 ’s past , i would have called them prisoners of war from the beginning			1
’ that , he said , would have meant their legal status would have been clear from the outset			0
they would also have been covered by @entity60 of the @entity61 , which was not applied to @entity2 detainees until a @entity64 decision in 2006			1
mr @entity0 played a key role in creating @entity2 under @entity34 many legal critics say that it was @entity7 ’s failure to recognise @entity68 after 9/11 which opened the road to torture and prisoner abuse			1
mr @entity0 admitted : ‘ there were people who were treated badly , and this is not something we are proud of			2
’ however , he insisted such abuse had stopped , saying that some detainees had become adept at making false allegations			0
‘ they know that we look into every credible allegation , and that absorbs an enormous amount of manpower and effort			0
with @entity2 , the amount of deceptive smoke overwhelms the tiny amount of fire from years ago			2
’ he declined to be drawn as to whether anyone should still be prosecuted and tried under the military tribunal system he helped create			0
guards sit in a tower overlooking @entity2 detention camp in may 2007 but he added if any more detainees beyond the six currently facing military commissions were to be charged , it might well be better to do this in ordinary federal courts			1
‘ they have many advantages , such as the number of offences which can be prosecuted in them			0
’ @entity0 agreed that restrictions imposed by @entity108 on releasing or transferring detainees have ensured that progress towards closing @entity2 has ground to a halt			1
the answer , he said , was take a more radical step			0
‘ just like you ca n’t kill your way out of this war , you ’re not going to transfer your way out of @entity2			2
‘ the really hard question is , “ how do you end this war ? ” once you do , we legally have to let them all go , other than those we prosecute			0
’ he said @entity34 ’s term ‘ the global war on terrorism ’ had suffered from a lack of clarity , suggesting that it might be effectively limitless			2
‘ the struggle with terrorism is not going to end			0
but we do have to end the legally cognizable armed conflict with @entity23 , a specific transnational group			0
‘ arguably , if the war aim of diminishing @entity23 ’s ability to mount a certain level of attack has been achieved , we could declare an end to hostilities and return to dealing with the threat as a law enforcement matter			0

@entity0 had key role in creating @entity2 under @entity34
he has now argued the detention camp should never have been built
he said detainees should have been @entity147 's and held in @entity5
if charged , they should have been taken to @entity7 prisons , he said
