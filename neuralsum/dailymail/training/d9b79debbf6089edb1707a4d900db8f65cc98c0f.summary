funny , is n’t it , how trends come around again			0
i started at @entity3 in the early seventies , when bell - bottom flares and denims filled the racks			0
now , in 2015 , they ’re back in fashion			0
what i ’m more surprised about is seeing a @entity12 throw - back in our politics			0
@entity16 ’s attack this week on a major @entity18 business smacked of the destructive anti-business mood that went out of political fashion decades ago			1
@entity21 — the boss of @entity22 the chemist — voiced his fears about the implications of a @entity16 government			1
but more than 40 of the chief executives in the @entity41 companies are not @entity18 — and a quarter of the chairmen are n’t @entity18 either			2
why should they be disqualified from speaking about matters which are directly their concern ? as a man responsible for 70,000 workers — that ’s 70,000 livelihoods supporting 70,000 families — mr @entity21 was perfectly entitled to speak out			1
what happens in @entity53 has a direct impact on his employees and his customers			2
but @entity16 reacted with furious attacks			1
there was a tide of derision from their backbenches ; personal jibes about mr @entity21 and his ‘ big mansion ’ ; even slights against the boss of one of our best - loved @entity69 chains from the shadow business secretary himself			1
though some might dismiss this as just another political spat , to me it is more significant			0
it marks a turning of the tide that every business and worker in the country should pay attention to			0
for a long time , we seemed to have reached a consensus about business in @entity18			2
mainstream politicians agreed that business was not the enemy but the vital engine that kept our economy moving , creating jobs and opportunities			0
@entity21 voiced fears about the implications of a @entity16 government , prompting @entity16 to react with furious attacks there was an agreement that enterprise should be rewarded ; that wealth - creators should not be squeezed ‘ until the pips squeak ’ , as the @entity16 chancellor @entity101 is alleged to have said in the @entity12 — but that they should be welcomed for the contribution they make to our economy , and the dynamism they bring			1
the old days of punitive taxes on business - people , of class war and the stirring of resentment , seemed hopelessly old - fashioned			2
politicians on both the @entity112 were united in a belief that a strong economy was not , in the end , built by officials in @entity117 , but by enterprising individuals on @entity119 and in offices up and down the country — and that beyond reasonable regulation and taxation , governments should let them get on with the job			0
now , @entity30 and the @entity16 have blown that consensus apart			1
for the past few years , there has been a steady drum - beat of anti-business policies from @entity16			1
it started with a speech in which @entity30 labelled businesses as ‘ predators ’			2
@entity16 has mooted a national insurance rise that would squeeze small firms and make it less attractive to take on new workers			1
it has proposed a hike in corporation tax — a policy which might play well to the gallery , but which would see @entity18 jobs being lost overseas			1
their ill - advised energy price freeze policy threatened investment into the @entity18			1
most important , @entity16 lacks a clear and credible plan to deal with @entity18 ’s remaining budget deficit			1
four decades of experience have taught me that businesses crave one thing above anything else : certainty			0
as a man responsible for 70,000 workers mr @entity21 , chief executive of @entity22 ( pictured ) , was perfectly entitled to speak out , according to @entity156 if business leaders are to grow their firms , if investors are to put their money in the @entity18 , they need to know that our economy is built on firm foundations			1
the prospect of more borrowing , spiralling interest rates and falling confidence is a worrying one , to say the least			0
and all this is happening against the backdrop of a turbulent global economy — an economy in which winning deals , trading and making a living is a daily battle for businesses in @entity18			2
i know how competitive this global economy is			0
if @entity18 gets bogged down in another era of sky - high taxes , over-regulation and business bashing , the jobs and the investment will simply go elsewhere — and the impact will be felt in shuttered shop fronts , empty @entity119 and lengthening dole queues			1
the @entity3 former chief says there has been a steady drum - beat of anti-business policies from @entity16 , starting with a speech in which @entity30 ( pictured ) labelled businesses as ‘ predators ’ these are the very possible real repercussions of anti-business policy and rhetoric			1
in my view , we need to back @entity18 businesses to the hilt ; to hear their concerns and not attack them for having them			1
last year , during the @entity206 referendum , we saw how attacks on businesses can quickly spin out of control			0
businesses that voiced their concerns about the impact of independence — and stated their support for the @entity216 — faced withering criticism and threats of boycotts			2
one senior politician even talked about a ‘ day of reckoning ’ for businesses and banks that had dared to speak about the potential downsides of independence			2
it was an extraordinary comment — a chilling comment — for any politician to make during what was a largely good - tempered debate about @entity206 ’s future			0
but it underlined the danger of resorting to abuse and personal attacks when people raise genuine concerns			0
in a healthy , thriving democracy , people must be free to speak out without fear or favour			0
so i have a suggestion for @entity30 and @entity16			1
when you run a major retail business , as i have done , and a lot of your time is spent in boardrooms and meetings , it ’s a good idea every now and again to ‘ walk the floor ’ — to get down onto the shop floor , get to know your staff , speak to customers and generally find out what is happening in the real world			2
@entity30 and his team should try doing the same			0
they should ‘ walk the floor ’ in @entity18 ’s businesses to experience the reality they face : earning a living , keeping overheads down , paying the wages each month			2
if they did , they would see that most firms , large or small , are made up not of greedy tycoons , but of men and women who work incredibly hard , who often commute long hours and who pay their taxes — like the 70,000 people who work for boots			0
this is the real face of @entity18 business			1
they are n’t the enemy			0
they are the backbone of our economy — and they deserve the support and respect of our politicians .			0

@entity16 **'s** attack on major @entity18 business smacked of destructive mood
boots boss @entity21 had voiced fears about a @entity16 government
he had a right to speak out as affairs in @entity53 affects his employees
but @entity16 reacted furiously , *reflecting* the party **'s** anti-business policies
@entity16 has mooted national insurance rise and a hike in corporation tax
their ill - advised energy price freeze policy threatened investment into @entity18
@entity30 needs to realise businesses are made up on *hardworking* @entity18
