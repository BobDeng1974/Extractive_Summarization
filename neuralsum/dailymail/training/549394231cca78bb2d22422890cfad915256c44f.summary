award - winning author @entity1 said he does n't love women writers enough to teach them , adding ' what i teach is guys '			1
his comments , made in a @entity13 interview , have caused backlash , with critics accusing him of hating women			0
however , the author of a perfect night to go to @entity20 , says if his students want to learn about women authors they should join another class , @entity18 reported			1
he said students who wanted to read women authors , such as @entity27 novelist @entity26 , should go down the hall where ' there are people who teach women writers much , much better than i can '			1
mr @entity1 , who teaches classes at @entity35 's @entity34 , said : ' usually at the beginning of the semester a hand shoots up and someone asks why there are n’t any women writers in the course			1
' however , far from disregarding works by women , mr @entity1 says the reason he does n't teach them is because he is n't passionate enough about their work			1
' when i was given this job i said i would only teach the people that i truly , truly love			0
unfortunately , none of those happen to be @entity20 , or women , ' he told @entity13			0
the only concession on his course is @entity56 , but mr @entity1 , a former @entity57 presenter , says even his third - year students struggle to understand the @entity60 author			2
mostly though , the professor focuses on ' guys			0
serious hetrosexual guys ' , such as @entity64 and @entity65			0
with a focus on mostly @entity68 and @entity69 modern short fiction , he added : ' i can only teach stuff i love			0
i ca n’t teach stuff that i do n’t			0
' make the grade : @entity56 , right , is included in the course that mainly includes writers such as @entity64 as well as women and @entity20 writers , he added that he had not yet found inspiring works by any @entity27 writers			2
the remarks led to backlash on @entity82 , with a barrage of commentators showing their distaste for his exclusion of women writers			2
mr @entity1 however , brushed off the controversy , saying his remarks had been taken out of context			2
' i was careless with my words , ' he told the @entity94 ' i said them in a such a way that they could be interpreted to be disparaging , dismissive			0
' he added that he had been talking @entity97 with a colleague at the time of the interview , which he blamed for distracting him from giving his interviewer his full attention			0
and , according to the @entity103 , mr @entity1 claims most of his students are young women , and that he teaches authors of questionable sexuality , which he argued counteracts claims that he only likes macho men			1
' i think anybody who teaches @entity112 can not be attacked for being an anti-anything			0
excluded : author @entity1 teaches classes at @entity35 's @entity34 he added : ' i want to apologize to the people who ended up feeling like that after reading my words			1
' a @entity35 statement said : ' neither @entity34 nor the @entity35 endorses the views attributed to @entity1 in the article			2
' it added that the ' noted @entity27 author and journalist , teaches elective seminars on his area of expertise , leaving other areas of literature to be taught by colleagues who can do so most effectively based on their areas of specialization			1

students wanting women writers can take another class , @entity1 says
@entity27 author who teaches at university says he can only teach what he 's passionate about
