' anxious ' : former @entity1 chairman @entity0 said the findings were ' not good news for integration ' white @entity6 are ' retreating ' from areas dominated by ethnic minorities , a study has revealed			1
analysis of census figures shows that white @entity6 are leaving areas where they are in a minority and are being replaced by immigrants and other ethnic minorities			1
as a result , nearly half of ethnic minorities – 4 million people – live in communities where whites make up less than half the population , the study by the @entity17 think - tank found			1
demos said the survey showed a ' spiral of white @entity6 demographic decline ' as white @entity6 choose to leave minority - dominated areas			1
@entity0 , the former chairman of the @entity30 , said the findings should make us ' a little anxious ' , and were ' not good news for the cause of integration '			0
he said : ' what ought to make us a little anxious is the “ majority retreat ” it has unearthed – white people leaving minority - led areas and not being replaced			1
' in 2005 , mr @entity0 warned @entity6 was ' sleepwalking into segregation ' as the @entity6 was dividing into ' ghettos ' of particular races and religions			0
sir @entity45 , chairman of the @entity47 think - tank , said : ' this is extremely serious			2
it is undeniable evidence that we have indeed been sleepwalking into segregation as @entity0 warned , and it is the clear result of @entity55 's mass immigration policy			0
' public dismay at the pace of change in our communities largely explains why so many voted as they did in last week 's local elections			0
the case for a sharp reduction in immigration is now overwhelming ; we can not possibly integrate new arrivals on anything like the present scale			0
' change : @entity69 has been a centre of ' white flight ' , with the number of minority residents increasing segregation : many areas of the capital have been deserted by their white @entity6 residents more than 600,000 white @entity6 londoners have left the capital in a decade , it was reported earlier this year			1
census figures show that between 2001 and 2011 the level of ' white flight ' reached @entity84 is the equivalent of a city the size of @entity87 - made up entirely of white @entity6 - moving out of the capital			1
the figures mean that for the first time , white @entity6 are in a minority in the country 's largest city			1
at the same time , some rural areas have seen a rise in the proportion of people who describe their ethnicity as ' white @entity6 '			2
some 3.7million @entity79 classified themselves as white @entity6 in 2011 – down from 4.3million in 2001 – despite the city 's population increasing by nearly a million over the decade to 8.2million			2
it was reported in february that white @entity6 made up 45 per cent of the city 's population , compared with 58 per cent in 2001			1
behind white @entity6 , the largest ethnic group in @entity69 is @entity104 ( 18 per cent )			1
black @entity79 make up 13 per cent			0
demos said the change was the result of ' white retreat ' , where departing white @entity6 are replaced by migrants and ' the natural growth of the minority population '			2
its analysis of the @entity114 showed 4.6million ethnic minorities – or 45 per cent of the total – live in areas where white @entity6 make up less than half the population			1
some 4.1million ethnic minorities live in council wards in which all whites – including foreign nationals – add up to less than half the total			1
that compares with only a million ethnic minorities – 25 per cent of the total – in the same situation at the time of the @entity129			2
such areas include @entity131 in @entity132 and several council wards in @entity134 and @entity69 , @entity17 said			2
at the same time , it showed more ethnic minority families were moving into ' white - dominated ' parts of the country			2
there are now just 800 council wards out of 8,850 where the population is 98 per cent white			1
that compares with 5,000 in 2001			0
mr @entity0 said : ' this very interesting piece of research reveals a number of vital findings about how people in @entity150 and @entity151 are living together			0
' first , it shows a kind of “ @entity155 effect ” – a welcome minority advance into areas previously only the preserve of the white majority			0
' it also demonstrates a greater degree of ethnic mixing within cities , although unfortunately this appears to be mostly between minorities			0
' ' flight ' : whites make up less than half the population in several council wards in east @entity69 , pictured the ' @entity155 effect ' refers to the arrival of ethnic minority characters in recent years into plotlines on the @entity173 soap @entity155			1
@entity174 , director of @entity17 , said the survey identified a growing population which is ' geographically separate ' and has ' limited familiarity with majority cultural codes '			0
he added : ' the greater concentration of the ethnic minority population means there is less opportunity for interaction with the white mainstream			0
' @entity185 , a professor at @entity186 who carried out the detailed analysis , said : ' these results present a mixed picture			0
while ethnic mixing and integration is being helped by more minority people moving into @entity150 's whitest areas , the most concentrated minority areas are just becoming more so			0
