the red carpet is normally the place for stars to show off the most recent — and most expensive — designer dresses			2
so this year ’s @entity4 were rather unusual			2
because rather than @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity10 , most of the celebrities in attendance were wearing frocks from @entity12			0
yes , the department store more commonly patronised by mothers - of - the - bride in search of fascinators and pastel suits has dipped a toe into the highly competitive world of celebrity dressing			1
take @entity41 , who recently defected from the @entity42 to @entity44 ’s @entity43			1
she wore a pink @entity46 dress by @entity48 brand @entity47 — priced at £ 289 to you and i , free for @entity41			1
but it was so clingy it left observers wondering why she could n’t have shelled out on a decent bra to wear underneath			0
@entity41 ’s colleague , @entity56 , had a freebie of her own , albeit the same frock as her co-star in a different colour — a champagne version			1
@entity48 also dressed pop star and @entity63 contestant @entity24 in a stunning dynasty black sequin dress			1
and model @entity30 , daughter of @entity31 and @entity33 star @entity32 , was dressed by @entity48 in a £ 290 beaded @entity35 dress and pretty silver clutch , £ 80 , by @entity68			1
@entity41 wore the @entity70 - style dress in fuschia , which costs normal shoppers £ 289 @entity41 's @entity44 colleague @entity56 also opted for the @entity47 dress but in a shimmering champagne far from the @entity76 : @entity77 went for a lace mini by @entity79 supplied by the now - glamorous store soap star @entity77 modelled a champagne lace dress by @entity79 , while @entity83 of made in @entity82 chose a @entity47 feather cape , £ 65 , and a green patent clutch from the department store			1
another @entity47 at @entity12 fan was @entity88 , star of the @entity90 series @entity91 , in a £ 149 green draped dress			0
and actress @entity93 , of @entity94 , chose a @entity48 @entity96 jacket , £ 99 , and trousers , £ 69			0
even the men succumbed to the temptations of @entity12			1
hollywood star @entity100 , @entity101 of @entity76 and @entity103 ’s @entity102 all turned up in suits provided by the store			1
so how did @entity12 manage to take over the @entity4 ? unsurprisingly , many are muttering that it has rather more to do with its generous freebie policy than its fashion appeal			2
the store made its first moves back in april , when the @entity38 nominations were announced			1
before , the department store was more commonly patronised by mothers - of - the - bride in search of fascinators and pastel suits nominees were encouraged to get in touch with @entity12 as one of the award ’s sponsors , and were told they could pop into the store to select an outfit , or request to have dresses sent to them			1
for the seriously disorganised , there was another option : turn up to the @entity12 suite at the @entity131 in @entity132 on the day of the @entity4 and waltz off with a freebie there and then			2
@entity12 spokesman @entity135 said : ‘ we are the official menswear and womenswear sponsor to the @entity4			0
we reach out to all the nominees and the citation readers and offer them clothes			0
‘ quite a lot of people went to the @entity131 to get ready , and if there was a last - minute emergency , we were happy to offer them clothes			0
’ ms @entity148 added that sometimes the freebies were only loans — if something was a sample from next season ’s collection , for instance — but generally the clothes were complimentary to anyone with a high enough profile			0
@entity100 ( left ) wore one of the store 's suits to present the @entity162 , as did @entity102 ( right ) suited up : @entity93 , of @entity94 , chose a @entity48 @entity96 jacket , £ 99 , and £ 69 - trousers it was n’t the end to @entity48 ’s largesse			2
they also gave a couple of items for the ceremony ’s goody bags : a clutch bag and @entity175 bow tie			0
so what has made them so generous ? well , amid much gloom on the @entity180 , the chain reported a stellar @entity181			0
while their rivals @entity183 and @entity185 struggled , they claimed their best ever trading period , with profits up by 4.3 per cent			0
the independent chain was also recently sold to the @entity190 conglomerate @entity189 , which is keen to open 50 stores in @entity192 , four in @entity193 and two in @entity195			0
@entity189 chairman @entity196 said @entity12 has ‘ a strong and iconic heritage brand in the @entity198 and abroad ... it has the type of department store management system that the @entity192 department stores lack ’			1
whether he will opt to keep the uber - generous freebie policy for stars who surely can afford to clothe themselves remains to be seen .			2
