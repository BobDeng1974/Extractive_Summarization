by @entity0 published : 21:42 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 5 march 2013 @entity1 has vowed for the first time to take steps towards putting an end to the country 's ivory trade , as wildlife groups warned the slaughter of elephants will continue until a ban is imposed			1
the country 's domestic ivory trade is currently legal , but activists say smuggled @entity15 tusks are mixed in with native stocks , and that skyrocketing demand in @entity1 is helping to fuel the worst poaching crisis in @entity19 in 20 years			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity20 has pledged to tighten controls on the country 's local tusk trade and to ' work towards ' putting an end to the trade altogether , but failed to give a timeline for implementing a ban			1
trade : a @entity1 woman examines two elephant tusks on display in the window of a @entity34 jewellery shop ms @entity20 made the pledge during the opening meeting of the 178 - nation @entity37 ( @entity37 ) in @entity34 this week			1
she said her government would tighten controls on @entity1 's local tusk trade by systematically registering domestic elephants and ivory products			1
then , ' as a next step , we will work towards amending the national legislation with the goal of putting an end to ( the ) ivory trade and to be in line with international norms ' , she said			1
but there was no timeline and @entity53 , deputy director of @entity1 's department of parks and wildlife , said there were no immediate plans for a domestic ban			1
he said that could happen ' step by step in the future - maybe ' , but called it ' the long - term goal '			0
for now , the government will focus on boosting measures to tighten domestic trade controls and slow the flow of @entity15 ivory from entering @entity1 markets			1
@entity1 traders currently have the right to buy or sell ivory obtained legally from domesticated stocks , and mr @entity53 said taking those rights away could be tantamount to the struggle to ban assault weapons in the @entity79			1
' you can not change everything overnight , ' he said			0
' it 's going to take time			0
' warning : conservationists say @entity1 's thriving ivory trade is helping to fuel illegal poaching in other countries including @entity19 asked how @entity1 's legislation might be amended , he said there was a push to add @entity15 elephants to @entity1 's own lists of protected species , a move that would allow authorities to impose higher fines and harsher jail terms on smugglers			1
@entity100 , head of the @entity102 's delegation to cites , welcomed ms @entity20 's pledge but said ' the fight to stop wildlife crime and shut down @entity1 's ivory markets is not over '			1
' the fight to stop wildlife crime and shut down @entity1 's ivory markets is not over ' @entity100 , @entity102 ms @entity20 ' now needs to provide a timeline for this ban and ensure that it takes place as a matter of urgency , because the slaughter of elephants continues ' , he said			1
around 70 years ago , up to five million elephants are believed to have roamed @entity19			2
today , just several hundred thousand are left			0
last year , 32,000 elephants were killed on the continent , according to the @entity119 , which says black - market ivory sells for around £ 865 per pound ; much of it ends up as tourist trinkets			2
@entity1 is one of the world 's top destinations for smuggled ivory - second only to @entity127 , according to the wildlife monitoring network traffic			2
the group has called for @entity37 members to impose economic trade sanctions against @entity1 , along with @entity132 and @entity133 , which would halt those nations ' ability to trade in all 35,000 species regulated by the convention			2
cites banned the international ivory trade in 1989			1
but the move never addressed domestic markets like @entity1 's , where trading remains legal as long as only ivory from domesticated elephants is involved			1
animals such as rhinos , tigers and orangutans will not be left in the wild in 30 years ' time , more than half of @entity146 believe			0
the poll finding comes as the government launches a new ' if they 're @entity155 ' campaign to highlight the threats to some of the world 's highest - profile endangered species - rhinos , elephants , tigers and orangutans - and the action people can take to help them			0
launching the campaign , involving more than 20 wildlife groups , zoos and safari parks , environment secretary @entity170 said he did not want future generations to think of the four species in the same way he thought of the dodo			0
under threat : more than half of @entity146 believe there will be no rhinos left in the wild in 30 years time the survey of more than 1,700 people for the campaign found that 54 % did not think those animals will be left in the wild in 30 years ' time			0
the concern over the fate of species such as rhinos is mirrored by the experts , with @entity193 's chief executive @entity192 warning that this year one rhino has been lost to poachers every 11 hours , on average			0
he said : ' if this poaching continues to escalate , a species which has existed on this planet for 40 million years faces the very real prospect of extinction in our lifetime			0
' we can not be the generation that allows this to happen and @entity206 is working hard to preserve all endangered species			0
' the government 's campaign comes as countries meet in @entity1 for the latest meeting of the @entity37 on the @entity212 ( @entity37 ) , where efforts to protect species such as rhinos , elephants and sharks are on the agenda			2
the @entity219 , royal patron of the @entity193 , has urged the conference to do more to protect rhinos and elephants from illegal killing for their ivory and horn , which has become extremely valuable for use in traditional @entity230 medicine			2
' we can not be the generation that allows this to happen ' @entity192 , @entity193 chief executive the @entity146 @entity209 is calling for countries attending the meeting to maintain the ban on ivory sales and to protect rhinos by bringing in stricter controls on the export and re-export of rhino horn			2
the campaign , launched today , also outlines how the public can help protect endangered species , urging them to think before they buy anything that could be made from or contain body parts of endangered species , ask where products have come from and get involved with wildlife conservation projects			0
launching the campaign at the @entity254 , mr @entity170 said : ' if they 're @entity155 aims to raise awareness and encourage individuals to take action to protect four of the planet 's most iconic species , rhinos , elephants , orangutans and tigers , from extinction			0
' it 's by working together that we show international leadership in the fight against the disastrous trade in wildlife and the devastating impact of deforestation			0
' he added : ' there are no medicinal benefits to traditional @entity230 medicines that contain animal parts and by turning your back on them you can help to protect these iconic animals			0
' meanwhile , the @entity283 has gathered 40,000 signatures for a petition calling on cites to implement a full ban on any trade in ivory to stop the poaching of african elephants			1
a recent report by conservation charity @entity102 warned that trafficking of wildlife products , from rhino horn to illegal timber , is one of the world 's biggest trades , worth £ 12 billion a year , and is driving species towards extinction , funding war and damaging communities .			0
