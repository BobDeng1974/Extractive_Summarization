babies might be smarter than we had previously thought and can understand complex social situations from the age of just 13 months old			1
a study has found that infants are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying , friendship and what it means to be a bystander			1
in an experiment with puppets they responded to different scenarios in a way that suggested they were more engaged than had been expected			1
a study has found that 13 month old babies ( a stock image is shown ) are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying , friendship and what it means to be a bystander the researchers asked parents of 48 infants aged around one to bring them into the lab for the experiment			1
they were sat down in front of a stage where two puppets appeared			2
first , puppet a and puppet b interacted in a friendly manner so the children could get used to them			2
the scientists then put on a show with a variety of scenarios			0
children watched a puppet show in which characters named @entity42 , behaved in a friendly way towards each other , as well as bullied and hit each other ( a real scenario is shown in a stock image ) a third puppet , @entity49 , walked up and was deliberately knocked down by b as @entity42 looked on			1
in the next scenario when puppet a was n't present , @entity50 knocked down c , and in a third scenario , @entity54 was accidentally knocked down as @entity42 looked on			2
children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years , according to a study published last summer			1
psychologists at @entity61 studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four - year - olds who were identical ans non-identical twins			2
those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later			0
the children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child			0
each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head , nose , ears , hair , body and arms			0
the children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing , and again at the age of 14			0
the researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores			0
dr @entity89 , of the @entity90 at @entity61 , said : ‘ our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life			0
‘ through drawing , we are attempting to show someone else what ’s in our mind			0
' this capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability , in a similar way to writing , which transformed the human species ’ ability to store information and build a civilisation			0
’ the researchers could not talk to the babies to see their response so they monitored how long they looked at the stage to gauge their interest and engagement			2
the findings showed that the babies looked longer at things that were unexpected and novel than things which were more predictable			1
for example , this happened when puppet a behaved in a friendly manner with b - even after he deliberately knocked down @entity128 psychological scientists and study authors @entity131 and @entity132 of the @entity133 said : ‘ this to us indicates infants have strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others - his or her acquaintance or " friend " should do something about it ’			1
another instance when the babies looked longer at the stage was when puppet a shunned @entity50 even if he was not there when he knocked down @entity128 the scientists said this suggested that the babies were able to keep track of what puppet @entity42 knew and use that information to make inferences about it ’s behaviour			1
the findings indicated the newborns had ‘ strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others ’ , the researchers said			0
in their report they explained : ‘ our findings show that 13 - month - olds can make sense of social situations using their understanding about others ’ minds and social evaluation skills			1
‘ the research is innovative in that we show that infants are able to construe social situations from different participants ’ perspectives			1
’ previous research has suggested that babies are incredibly inquisitive and adaptable			0
however not all studies said they are smart and the @entity179 's @entity178 concluded they were ‘ so stupid it ’s not even funny ’ .			0

psychologists at the @entity133 used puppets to study how 13 - month - old children responded to different social situations
they found that babies are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying , friendship and what it means to be a bystander
findings showed that the babies looked longer at things that were unexpected and novel than things which were more predictable
