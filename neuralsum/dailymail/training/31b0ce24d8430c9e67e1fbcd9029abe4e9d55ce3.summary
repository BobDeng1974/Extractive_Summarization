by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 11:26 est , 23 october 2012 life is full of scenes that you wish you could remember forever			0
invariably though , even with the fastest responding digital cameras , cherished moments often pass before they can be pictured			0
that said , it is questionable whether you would want a camera attached to you snapping virtually every moment of your life and transmitting the pictures to the internet where they will be stored forever			1
in case you do , however , a @entity16 tech startup has developed just such a device , and the service to go with it			0
good idea or bad idea ? the tiny @entity24 camera clips to your clothes and takes pictures every 30 seconds - capturing moments of your life that would otherwise be lost to fading memories @entity29 : though it is just the size of a postage stamp , the @entity30 incorporates a five - megapixel camera and gps unit that geotags all the pictures it takes roughly the size of a postage stamp , the @entity30 camera attaches discreetly to your clothes and automatically snaps geo - tagged photos - so no memory of your daily life is ever forgotten			1
it has no buttons , but automatically captures the scene - and records the user 's location - every 30 seconds before uploading the tagged images to the internet for review later			1
potentially the device gives users the chance to rediscover photos they never even knew were taken , capturing the moment , for example , when you first saw your future love or your baby flash a gummy grin			0
measuring just 26 x 26 x 9mm , the @entity30 still manages to incorporate a five - megapixel camera and a battery that will keep snapping for about two days before needing a recharge			1
jogging memories : the @entity30 will automatically snap every dog and tree you pass ping pong memories : never again will an epic rally be lost to misty memories privacy concerns : the team behind @entity75 promise that pictures uploaded to their servers will be encrypted and visible only the the user to replenish the camera 's power , users need simply to connect it to their computer ; at the same time the device automatically uploads the pictures to @entity75 's servers where they are catalogued accoring to date , time , location and even lighting conditions			1
photos can then be searched and shared through the company 's web service or with the aid of a @entity30 app which is scheduled for release on both @entity95 and @entity97 platforms			1
though some may be uncomfortable with loading images of their entire life to the cloud , with the camera generating @entity103 of data a day - a phenomenal 1.5 terabytes a year - there really is no other practical storage option			2
to assuage privacy concerns @entity75 's team promises they will remain private by default , encypted and only visible to the user			0
the team behind the @entity30 are looking for funding to realise their project through @entity113			2
so far they have received about half their hoped for $ 150,000 dollars to bring the product to market and hope to put it on sale by 2013			0
' many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by , too fast for us to grasp , ' they say			0
' we at @entity30 wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens			2
