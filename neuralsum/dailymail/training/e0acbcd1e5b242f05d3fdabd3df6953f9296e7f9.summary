@entity0 may be a @entity2 - winning @entity1 with an international pedigree but arguably his greatest achievement is simply being alive to tell the tale			1
in february , the 71 - times capped scrum - half , 31 , who will make his @entity9 debut on sunday for @entity10 against @entity11 , was taking part in a routine recovery session in the swimming pool for his former @entity16 side the @entity18 when disaster struck			1
‘ me , @entity23 and @entity24 were in the water doing lengths for recovery , stretching and whatnot , ’ said @entity0 , speaking for the first time about the stroke which almost cost him his life			1
death - defying : @entity2 - winning @entity28 @entity0 reveals to @entity29 how he survived a stroke all black back : @entity0 , 31 , makes his debut for @entity10 on sunday as club returns to the @entity9 ‘ i went to explain something to them and found myself talking like a kid , a baby really			1
i could n’t say any words			0
i felt like an idiot			0
i got out of the pool and went to get dressed but i could n’t hear anything			0
all i could concentrate on was what was happening directly in front of me			0
a few of the boys were trying to chat away to me but i could n’t understand what they were saying			0
confused : @entity47 's @entity0 thought he was suffering from the effects of a concussion during the stroke but it was a hole in his heart , doctors found ‘ i had a bit of blurred vision and scarily i actually drove home			1
it was probably only a kilometre and a half so i drove as slowly as possible			1
i stopped if i needed to			0
i kept checking my eyes to see if it was something i had done in the pool			0
‘ i remember texting the team doctor to ask for help			0
but i did n’t know what i was doing or even how to use my phone properly to send the text			0
i got home and decided to wait it out a bit and see what happened before ringing the doc to work out what to do			0
i chilled out for about half an hour and started packing my bag before ringing the doctor to find out what was going on			1
it was a pretty scary not knowing what it was			0
’ initially @entity0 put the symptoms down to a concussion suffered in a previous game			1
but tests revealed he had suffered a stroke after blood was prevented from reaching his brain by a previously undiagnosed heart condition			1
‘ i had a hole in my heart and they ’re putting the stroke down to that , ’ he said			1
‘ at the time i thought it may have been a delayed concussion type of injury			1
but once i ’d had all the scans we realised it was to do with the heart			1
’ @entity0 required surgery to block the hole and now , seven months later , he says he is ready to resurrect his career after becoming one of the @entity9 ’s few high - profile summer signings			1
but surely such a dramatic health scare called him to question his chosen profession ? highlight : @entity0 ( right ) poses with the @entity2 's @entity105 with @entity1 team - mate @entity106 ‘ not at all , ’ he said			1
‘ i would have done anything possible to get back on a rugby field			2
the only i way i would have hung up the boots would have been if i ’d broken my leg again			0
i ’d probably stay out on the field even if i was crawling			0
i tell my coaches all the time , “ do n’t take me off unless i ’m out on a stretcher ”			2
‘ all i wanted to know after the stroke was what the procedures were and what i needed to do to get back out on the pitch			1
i do n’t really know the background that caused me to have it			2
i ’ve just been trying to make the most of life in general			2
it ’s not easy to bounce back			2
it ’s in the back of your head that something like that could happen again			2
‘ i ’ve seen it [ the stroke ] as another opportunity at life and trying to make the most of it			1
that ’s the whole reason i came to the @entity135			0
this opportunity may not have come around this year or the year after			0
i ’ve been playing @entity16 for the last 11 seasons so it will be good to see what the @entity9 is all about			1
’ on sunday he will find out , partnering former @entity140 three - quarter @entity139 at half - back , as @entity143 ’s hastily assembled squad attempt to give the @entity144 the perfect start to the season against @entity148 ’s @entity147			1
@entity0 , who kicked the @entity1 to the @entity2 final in 2011 , will do so convinced he is ready to resume his career			1
he is content and ready for the next step in a rugby career that almost ended in that @entity47 pool			2
‘ it ’s early days but i ’m enjoying life here , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s good to be able to walk down the street and not be yelled at and expected to react like we are back home			2
i do n’t mind it			0
but if you want to get my attention then just approach me rather than try to yell for my attention			0
‘ i ’ve got no dramas with that			0
i might be a @entity2 winner but people should just say ‘ hello ’			2
i ’m not going to bite them			0
’ he is more concerned with taking a second bite at life			0
partnership : @entity0 will partner former @entity140 three - quarter @entity139 in the @entity174 halves			1
