by @entity0 published : 03:43 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 4 january 2013 animal - lover @entity1 knows a pet is for life - so she has had the faces of five of her dead cats tattooed on her back			1
dedicated @entity1 , of @entity8 , in the @entity10 region of @entity11 , had the pictures permanently inked on her skin so can always remember her beloved pets			0
the life - size portraits of @entity16 , @entity17 , mr @entity18 , mr @entity19 and @entity20 take up most of her back			1
cat - too : animal - lover @entity1 has had a picture of five of her dead cats tattood on to her back - clockwise from centre , the animals are @entity19 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 tribute : but @entity1 , right , admits she probably wo n't get the five cats she currently cares for tattooed on her back as well			1
pictured right is @entity17 , one of her dead pets @entity1 , 23 , said : ' i love my cats and i love my tattoo			1
a lot of people who have lost pets can relate to it			0
' i adopt sick cats because i wanted them to have somewhere to go - i took them home so they could live out their last days in comfort			0
' if i keep going , tattooing all the pets i will have in my lifetime , i 'd just be covered in cats			0
' @entity1 took in the cats from animal shelters and cared for them at her home , nursing the pets back to health			2
each of the tattoos incorporates an element of the cat 's personality - @entity16 is shown with worms in his mouth caring : @entity1 adopts ill cats and provides them with a comfortable life before they pass away			1
pictured are @entity20 , left , and @entity19 , right when they died , she decided to get a permanent tribute to the ill - fated animals - starting off with a set of small paw prints			1
but the design grew , incorporating ' elements of each one 's personalities ' until it finally covered her whole back			0
@entity1 , who works as a tattoo artist , said : ' i first started the tattoo for three cats and then added another two later			2
' i 've got five more cats now and if they die i think i 'll pay tribute to them symbolically instead of getting more tattoos			0
' remembrance : pictured is @entity1 's cat @entity18 , who is depicted wearing a monocle in the tattoo			2

@entity1 , 23 , has the faces of her dead cats tattooed on her back
life - sized tattoos feature @entity16 , @entity17 , mr @entity18 , mr @entity19 and @entity20
she has five more cats *...* but has no plans to add them to the giant tattoo
