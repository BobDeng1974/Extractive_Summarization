@entity0 has launched a scathing attack on @entity3 's ' politics of hate and envy ' and claimed the @entity6 are ' the real party of work '			1
the @entity8 said @entity9 was standing on ' the most left - wing platform since @entity11 ' and was ' peddling lies ' about the government 's record			1
in an interview with the @entity17 , the former @entity6 leader set out a powerful moral case for the party 's policies , which have reduced welfare dependency and got two million more into work			1
right , @entity3 leader @entity9 ' @entity3 does n't understand work			1
they do n't understand the importance of work in a cultural , social and health sense , ' he said			1
' instead they 're saying " here are the people we hate "			2
they hate people who get up early in the morning and work to get a business off the ground , they hate people who take risks , hate people that earn money , hate people that create jobs			1
' they are reinventing the politics of envy			2
it 's alive and well			1
it 's the politics of fear			1
it is n't a message of hope			2
' mr @entity0 called on fellow @entity25 to ' bang the drum ' in the next fortnight to champion the government 's achievements – and persuade voters that @entity67 's best days lie ahead if it sticks to its current economic course			1
hailing the ' staggering ' increase in employment , now at a record high , he insisted : ' there are more disabled people in work than under @entity3 , the proportion of people in social housing who have a job is higher than it has been since records began			1
' all these people that have gone back into work are lives saved in my book			1
success : the @entity8 hailed the ' staggering ' increase in employment , now at a record high			1
above , prime minister @entity90 on the campaign trail in @entity92 , @entity93 today ' everything i have done – the cap on benefits , the work experience for young kids , changes to sickness benefits – we really do care about people			1
' @entity3 thinks welfare and work are two sides of the same coin			1
we want to catch people when they fall , but we must get them to rise out of welfare dependency			2
' the @entity8 said @entity3 had made a ' staggering misjudgement ' when it claimed the government 's austerity measures would put one million people out of work			1
' they have been out by a factor of three million			0
in fact there are two million more in work , ' he said			1
' we know @entity9 and @entity123 were party to the government that misjudged the public finances so dramatically , despite all the warnings that we were running a deficit that was too high			1
' not only did they not fix the roof when the sun was shining , they smashed the tiles off			0
' that meant when the crisis came we were least prepared			0
it became what was actually for the @entity67 the worst depression since at least the 1920s			0
' not only can they not run an economy , they ca n't even forecast anything correctly			0
every proposal they have made as an opposition has been a joke			0
every solution involves looking to the past and the state spending more money			0
' they have never understood why they were wrong			0
they have learned nothing - absolutely nothing - since the financial crisis			1
' that 's why every @entity3 government leaves office with unemployment higher than when they came into power			1
' they think governments create jobs			0
the government can set the conditions by which businesses can thrive : lower taxes , less regulation , give entrepreneurs a reason to stay in the @entity67 and create jobs here			1
defence : the former @entity6 leader , pictured on @entity177 last week , set out a powerful moral case for the party 's policies , which have reduced welfare dependency and got two million more into work ' what @entity3 does is start to force up taxes , spend far too much , lose control of the public finances			1
' the economy suffers , people lose their jobs and the lowest - paid bear the brunt			2
' mr @entity0 claimed that having lost the argument on jobs , @entity3 was now deliberately misleading people about the nature of the employment created , suggesting it is mainly part - time and low - paid			2
' they peddle lies about the jobs			0
actually 80 per cent are full - time , 60 per cent are managerial level jobs			2
60 to 70 per cent are going to @entity67 - born citizens , compared to the 90 per cent of jobs that were going to foreign nationals under @entity3 , ' he said			2
' these are n't my figures - they 're official offical for @entity210 figures			2
yet @entity3 rattles its chains like a character from @entity213 and says everything is dreadful			0
' now people have been really hurt by the @entity216 that @entity3 oversaw			0
we ca n't expect people to run round and say " hooray " when we have started to turn things around			0
' their faith in the political system has been damaged			0
after all , @entity3 promised they 'd ended boom and bust			0
' but we 've stuck to our guns and people are starting to feel the pound in their pocket			0
we have incomes rising at two per cent in the private sector			0
things like fuel , heating and food prices have been falling			0
' the greatest risk we face is that the job is not completed			0
@entity3 is peddling this myth that somehow we can start spending more money that we have n't got			0
' he said @entity3 was also seeking to mislead voters about the future of the @entity243 , though they have not matched the @entity25 ' pledge to give it £ 8billion a year in extra funding			1
' they set out to scare people - to believe something nasty is happening			2
take the @entity243 - they say the @entity6 are going to damage or destroy the @entity243			2
it is an appalling lie , ' he said			0
the @entity8 warned that a @entity3 government ' would be a prisoner to two groups - not just the @entity253 , but also their own backbenchers '			1
' the vast majority of @entity256 do not believe in any element of deficit reduction			0
they think we should tax people on any more than average earnings and they want welfare payments to increase dramatically. , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 warned @entity3 would halt his programme to replace all out - of - work benefits and tax credits with a new universal credit , which ensures it always pays more to take a job or more hours than remain on benefits			1
he also revealed that the new benefit will be denied to @entity274 immigrants to deter low - paid incomers			2
mr @entity0 said he wanted immigrants to wait for four years before they qualified , and had already opened talks with the @entity277 on introducing the lengthy time line .			0

@entity8 hailed the @entity25 as ' the real party of work '
@entity283 is standing on ' most left - wing platform since @entity11 '
