two tries in three minutes while @entity1 was in the sin - bin saved @entity3 before they beat @entity4 26 - 3 at the start of their @entity7 title defence			1
@entity8 and @entity9 sneaked scores while hooker @entity1 was off the field , after @entity3 had laboured with scant return in a tryless first hour			1
@entity14 suffered a hamstring injury in the warm - up , so the luckless @entity19 flanker 's wait for his first @entity21 action since november 2013 goes on			1
@entity3 scrum half @entity8 burrows over for his side 's opening try following a powerful maul from the pack @entity3 flanker @entity9 , who was called up late to the starting line - up following @entity14 's hamstring injury , crosses late on @entity3 centre @entity29 is stopped in his tracks by @entity4 's @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 @entity4 xv : @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity32 , @entity37 ; @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity1 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 replacements : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 penalties : @entity33 ( 1 ) @entity3 xv : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity29 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity8 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity9 , @entity68			1
replacements : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 tries : @entity8 , @entity9 conversions : @entity61 ( 1 ) , @entity76 ( 1 ) penalties : @entity61 ( 3 ) the 27 - year - old will now be an automatic doubt for @entity3 's second - round clash with @entity84 in @entity85 next weekend			1
@entity14 has only just recovered from 14 months battling two consecutive shoulder reconstructions , and the 30 - cap loose - forward cut a disconsolate and broody figure on @entity3 's bench			1
@entity3 's management were just as stern - faced despite victory , because the visitors never found any control or fluency at the @entity95			1
@entity4 lost all five @entity7 matches last year , and @entity3 thumped the @entity4 46 - 7 in @entity85 : there would be no repeat this time			2
@entity61 landed four penalties and a conversion but failed to seize his chance to prove he deserves more time in @entity3 's 10 shirt			1
the @entity103 fly - half was unable to boss his backline , all too often standing all too deep in attack : fit - again @entity107 will doubtless return against @entity84 next weekend after 12 weeks missing with concussion			0
@entity3 may live to regret not racking up a bigger score against the lowly @entity110 , who tend to crack as tournaments progress			0
should this year 's @entity7 come down to points difference , just as last year , the @entity113 may rue not pushing the envelope somewhat once this game broke up			2
all the fizzing electricity from @entity119 's tournament opening 21 - 16 win over @entity121 in @entity122 turned to dismal static in a humdrum first - half in @entity124			2
@entity59 , making his @entity7 debut for @entity3 , makes some early inroads into the @entity110 defence in @entity124 where @entity121 sparkled and @entity119 shone , @entity3 could only glower in the gloom of uninspired , guileless first - half attacking play			1
@entity4 proved the architects of their own discomfort right from the off , @entity40 penalised for slipping his bind at the scrum			0
@entity43 's cheap knock - on gifted @entity3 field position , and a pointless midfield offside allowed @entity61 to open the scoring from the tee			1
@entity62 atoned for conceding a scrum penalty by winning a fine choke - tackle turnover , in tandem with @entity67			0
@entity61 endured a mixed opening , slotting his penalty calmly , but throwing a loose pass and also being charged down by @entity36			0
@entity4 scrum half @entity150 loses the ball under pressure from opposite number @entity8 ( left ) @entity61 doubled his and @entity3 's tally after @entity156 wandered offside to retrieve @entity34 's knock - on			1
@entity3 drove close from a lineout maul , but @entity58 could not tap @entity8 's deft chip back inside with enough space for the scrum - half to wriggle home			1
the visitors had to settle instead for @entity61 's third penalty of the afternoon			0
@entity4 then set camp in @entity3 's 22 but after one driving maul @entity33 opted to strike at goal			2
the @entity169 - born fly - half landed the goal to cut @entity4 's deficit to six points at the break			0
@entity3 started the second half searching for some kind of fuel injection , but still their attack misfired			0
@entity4 captain @entity46 drives forward as @entity3 full back @entity177 tries to halt the no 8 's progress @entity61 produced a neat half - break on the blindside , only to force an attempted last pass : @entity36 knocked on trying to intercept , allowing @entity3 a quick wipe of the brow			1
@entity61 almost cut the line again in @entity4 's 22 , but @entity46 produced a fine ruck steal to ease the pressure			0
@entity29 raced close after @entity60 's neat wide pass , but @entity59 knocked on trying to sneak through			0
@entity29 and @entity59 noticeably picked up the pace after the break , but again @entity3 turned to @entity61 's boot to extend their lead to 12 - 3			1
@entity3 dispensed with posting penalties instead chasing the jugular just past the hour , punting to the corner for an attacking lineout			0
@entity3 fly half @entity61 fires over an early penalty during a sloppy first half at the @entity95 @entity61 produced a neat half - break on the blindside , only to force an attempted last pass : @entity36 knocked on trying to intercept , allowing @entity3 a quick wipe of the brow			2
@entity61 almost cut the line again in @entity4 's 22 , but @entity46 produced a fine ruck steal to ease the pressure			0
@entity29 raced close after @entity60 's neat wide pass , but @entity59 knocked on trying to sneak through			0
@entity29 and @entity59 noticeably picked up the pace after the break , but again @entity3 turned to @entity61 's boot to extend their lead to 12 - 3			1
@entity3 dispensed with posting penalties instead chasing the jugular just past the hour , punting to the corner for an attacking lineout			0
@entity4 winger @entity156 ( left ) competes for a high ball with @entity3 and @entity217 three - quarter @entity58 @entity1 spoiled @entity3 's maul from an offside position and was duly sin - binned for his troubles			2
@entity3 went straight for the lineout once more , and finally broke the try deadlock			0
@entity8 wriggled home after the pack drove to the whitewash , with @entity61 converting for a 19 - 3 lead			2
no sooner had @entity3 scored than boss @entity227 brought off @entity61 , @entity66 and @entity228 , no doubt with one eye on next weekend 's @entity84 clash			2
@entity3 dominate possession and territory but can not break the stubborn @entity110 defence in the opening 60 minutes as @entity57 makes a charge @entity3 lock @entity65 makes a strong charge into the @entity4 defence as hooker @entity63 arrives in support @entity9 then raced through @entity4 's porous midfield to rubber - stamp @entity3 's victory			1
@entity76 slotted the conversion to gloss the scoreline , but @entity3 were unable to maintain that momentum once @entity4 were restored to full complement			0
@entity4 's rally forced @entity3 to defend with zeal and composure at the death when @entity227 's men would sooner have been attempting to boost their points - difference tally			2
@entity48 's sloppy spilled ball dented @entity4 's momentum , before @entity33 had a try ruled out for the slightest of knock - ons from @entity46 .			0

@entity61 kicks 14 points on his @entity7 debut
@entity3 flanker @entity14 was a late *withdrawal* after the *backrower* *tweaked* his hamstring in the warm - up
@entity8 powered over for @entity3 's opening try in the 64th minute
@entity9 raced away for @entity3 's second soon after
