it leaves little time for @entity2 to prove his fitness before the @entity3 kick - off against @entity19 on february 6 , with @entity1 head coach @entity20 expected to name his squad early next month			1
@entity1 centre @entity2 faces a race to be fight for the start of the @entity3 the 23 - year - old in action for club side @entity6 against @entity27 in august speaking in the first week of december , @entity6 director of rugby @entity28 stressed the importance of @entity31 to the national team ’s ambitions , saying : ‘ @entity2 has been huge for @entity1			1
' hopefully , he will be fit and playing come @entity35 time and he will be back into the @entity1 squad for the @entity3			1
‘ when @entity1 have played at their best , @entity2 has been at his best			1
’ @entity2 has been sidelined since october , when he suffered a groin injury during @entity6 ’s @entity40 victory over @entity41			1
the @entity43 club have missed his physical presence , although @entity46 international @entity45 could return to fill in against @entity47 on sunday after starting on monday for the club ’s reserves			2
the delay is unwelcome news for @entity20 , who sees @entity2 as the missing piece in @entity1 ’s midfield after a below - par autumn international series			1
@entity55 looks on during @entity47 's match with @entity47 on sunday @entity58 - born @entity57 kept the no 13 jersey warm during the @entity60 but he offers nowhere near as much potency in attack			2
@entity2 ’s physicality sets him apart from his compatriots			2
@entity1 have tended to back sizeable midfielders including @entity57 , @entity66 and @entity67 over lighter options such as @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 — and few come more sizable than @entity2			1

but the @entity93 forward has been in training for three weeks and could make a late charge into @entity97 ’s plans			0
@entity99 's @entity98 kicks a penalty during his side 's defeat to @entity47 earlier this month he may return to @entity104 action this weekend , though @entity86 coaches are unlikely to rush him straight into the starting xv			0
the @entity108 club have suffered two consecutive defeats , but will be favourites when they face @entity99 at home on saturday			0
@entity113 scrum - half @entity98 remains optimistic , despite his side failing to gel after a summer of intensive recruitment			0
‘ some boys feel the pressure but you need to go the other way , train hard , train well and improve your skill set , ’ said @entity98			0
‘ i truly believe we have the players here and the coaching staff to be able to do that			0
‘ sometimes it is hard to remain positive but you have to			0
