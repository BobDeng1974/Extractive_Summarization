by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:14 est , 25 february 2014 they served in three wars , became known as @entity5 because of their awesome fire - power , and during the @entity8 they dropped more bombs than all other @entity11 army aircraft combined			2
packed with high - explosives and bristling with heavy machine guns , the @entity5 earned a rightful reputation as a fearsome weapon of war			0
today , however , there are only 14 aircraft still able to take to the skies , perhaps the most famous of which is the @entity21			0
originally known as @entity21 , and later renamed after the 1990 film of her exploits , she was not only the first aircraft to complete her 25 - mission tour - of - duty without being shot down , but she did so without losing a single member of her crew			1
all ten men who served aboard the aircraft escaped the war with little more than a scratch , a miracle in a profession famed for the short life - span of its members , and despite the @entity40 often returning to base with her engines shot out and riddled with bullet holes			2
now the @entity21 has taken to the skies once again , complete with a crew of @entity8 veterans who served aboard other b - 17s during the conflict			1
the @entity48 is perhaps the most famous of all b - 17 bombers , as she was the first to complete her tour - of - duty without being shot down not only did the aircraft survive her time in combat , so did all ten members of her crew which is a miraculous feat considering the famed short life - spans of pilots during the @entity8 during the @entity8 nearly 1,000 b - 17s could be sortied at any one time , but just 14 remain in flying condition today , including the @entity21			1
here the aircraft is pictured with veteran aviators @entity62 ( left ) , @entity63 ( centre ) and @entity65 ( right ) @entity65 , 92 , who also completed 25 missions as a tail gunner and ball - turret gunner in a different @entity5 , takes a flight on @entity70 mr @entity65 described the experience as ' wonderful ' saying the reliable aircraft had saved his life on two occasions , on both his first and last sortie while the four - engine design of the @entity5 may be outdated by today 's standards , its huge bulk bristling with high - powered machine guns still cuts an imposing figure for $ 450 the @entity82 , which is now in charge of the @entity40 , is offering flights on board the bomber starting at @entity87 , @entity88 , before stopping in @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and other locations across the @entity11 view from the top : a cameraman shows off the view through one of the bomber 's central gun turrets			0
in total the plane had up to eight gun positions manning a total of ten high - calibre machine guns pilots @entity105 ( left ) and @entity106 man the ageing controls of one of the last b - 17 bombers still able to take to the skies survivors : all ten of the @entity21 's crew members survived the war and are commemorated in a picture mounted in the old radio room of the aircraft the @entity120 bombsite inside the front turret of the @entity5 was so secret during the @entity8 that crew members had to destroy the device if the plane crashed , to keep the technology from the hands of the enemy originally named the @entity21 , the plane was renamed after the 1990 film of her exploits as @entity70			1
here pilot @entity105 holds a preflight briefing with veterans and enthusiasts while b - 17s are most famous for their role in the @entity8 , they were also used by the @entity11 military in @entity139 and @entity140 scars of battle : here the controls of the aircraft show the effects of nearly 70 years of use			0
in total 12,000 b - 17s were produced during the @entity8 , with more than 4,500 lost in combat			0

the @entity48 served during the @entity8 as a bomber with the *8th* @entity151 in @entity152
she is *arguably* the most famous b - 17 after becoming the first to complete a tour - of - duty without being shot down
not only that , but the @entity40 made it through the @entity8 without losing a single member of her ten - man crew
originally called the @entity21 , she was renamed after the 1990 film of her exploits
