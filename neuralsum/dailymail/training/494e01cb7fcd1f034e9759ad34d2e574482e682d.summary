by @entity0 former dr who assistant @entity2 : redheads still face prejudice despite prominence of stars with red hair and numbers of women who dye their hair red they suffer a lot of stick for their unusual hair colouring , with hurtful taunts of ' @entity16 ! ' resonating around playgrounds across the country			0
despite the prominence of stars @entity2 , prince @entity21 and @entity22 , redheads still complain that they fall victim to prejudice and discrimination			0
but new research shows that , far from being rare , @entity27 and @entity28 are in fact host to a secret army of red hair gene carriers			1
the results of the study , published today , indicate that more than 20million people in the @entity27 and @entity28 have the genes that can cause red hair			1
the researchers have put together the first - ever map detailing the distribution of red - headed genes across the two countries , showing exactly where red heads are most concentrated			1
the most red - headed part of @entity27 and @entity28 is the @entity44 of @entity45 with @entity46 as a red - hotspot where 40 per cent carry one of the three common red hair gene variants			1
but the biggest surprise revealed by the research is just over 34 per cent of the population of parts of the north of @entity55 are carriers , making @entity57 and @entity58 as red - headed as @entity28			1
the results of the year - long project have been published today by ancestry company @entity27 's dna to coincide with the @entity63 to be held in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity28 , this weekend			1
it comes in the wake of the @entity27 's first ever @entity69 march in @entity46 a fortnight ago , where more than a hundred redheads paraded through the streets to demonstrate against prejudice against people with red hair			0
a spokesman for @entity76 said : ' no - one needs a dna test to tell if they have red hair			2
all they need is a mirror			0
what @entity76 set out to discover was a hidden story , one never before told			0
this is the story of the secret carriers			0
' since red hair is recessive , children born with red hair need both parents to be carriers of one of the red hair gene variants			2
' but millions of people in @entity27 and @entity28 have no idea that they are carriers			2
our project at last reveals just how red - headed a nation we really are			2
' the study has found that the ' number of people is @entity27 and @entity28 who are carriers is very large indeed			2
we estimate a total of 20.4 million people are carriers of the red hair variants , ' the spokesman added			2
' that should help play down ginger jibes			0
' this map produced by @entity76 shows where redheaded genes are concentrated			1
the most red - headed part of @entity27 and @entity28 is the @entity44 of @entity45 with @entity46 as a red - hotspot where 40 per cent carry one of the three common red hair gene variants the study is based on data from 2,343 people who have undergone dna tests to learn more about their ancestry			1
researchers looked at three different variants of the @entity126 gene , which causes red hair			1
according to @entity76 , those with 151 - @entity130 - red have a 70,000 year old variant that probably arose in @entity132 ; those with 160 - @entity135 - red are descendants of someone who probably also lived in @entity132 70,000 years ago ; and 294 - @entity139 - reds belong to a much younger group who come from a @entity142 who lived about 30,000 years ago			0
in order for a child to develop red hair , both parents must be carriers of one of these red - hair gene variants			1
but even then there is only a 25 per cent their child will be born ginger			0
approximately 6 per cent of @entity45 have red hair , or about 300,000 people			1
of the @entity55 , about 4 per cent - around 2.1million people - are red heads			1
dr @entity158 , a geneticist at @entity159 and chief scientist at @entity27 's dna , said : ' the big surprise for me was that the frequency of the redhead variants was lower in the @entity166 , where many people probably think there are more redheads than elsewhere			0
' however , this makes sense when we realise that just like in the @entity175 and @entity176 , this probably means that the genes of the indigenous people have been diluted , in the north by @entity180 and in the south by @entity182			0
' @entity76 now hopes to continue their study further using new @entity185 gene testing technology which can test for all known variants of the @entity126 gene			0
once completed they expect to find the number of red hair gene carriers is even higher .			0

researchers create first ever map showing distribution of red head genes
in south - east @entity45 40 per cent carry one of the common variants
results show @entity57 and @entity58 are as redheaded as @entity28
