a lowly insurance clerk passed himself off as a @entity2 and lived at a top - security military base just yards from @entity5 for two years , @entity4 can reveal			1
office worker @entity6 , 42 , convinced soldiers at @entity8 – where troops who guard the @entity10 are based – that he was an elite commando			1
in fact , he was a pen - pusher who was living a fantasy life inside the base			0
father - of - three @entity6 was so convincing that soldiers from the @entity18 who were living there nicknamed him ‘ @entity24 ’ and shared classified details about protecting the @entity22 and conducting ceremonial duties			1
at a time when the @entity38 was on high alert against a terror attack , @entity6 convinced senior soldiers he was a commando sent to @entity43 to work at the @entity44 ( @entity44 )			1
while a telephone call to the @entity2 would have revealed @entity6 was bogus , he was given his own room with a bathroom in a soldiers ’ accommodation block , which he lived in until march this year			1
@entity6 became a familiar face at the barracks , where he built up his reputation as a tough @entity2 who did physical training with other soldiers and socialised with them in their bars on the base			2
aerial view of @entity5 showing the proxomity to @entity8 , @entity43 where @entity6 lived after passing himself off as a @entity2 in fact , @entity6 was a clerk working at the @entity44 in @entity61 whose job was to calculate the cost of insuring soldiers on exercises and missions			1
he had undergone low - level security checks but had no right to live on the base			2
@entity44 personnel like @entity6 would normally be escorted whenever they visited a high - security military base , but he could come and go as he pleased			2
the @entity72 and the @entity2 : neither @entity73 nor @entity6 is a real pub landlord or a genuine @entity2 but @entity6 did manage to con soldiers at @entity8 last night , an mp on the defence select committee demanded an urgent inquiry into the security breach			2
@entity80 ’s @entity79 said : ‘ this case is a wake - up call for the new defence secretary who should look closely at what happened , because the implications of the case are very serious			0
‘ if you consider the heightened vulnerability of @entity43 since the 7/7 attacks in 2005 , and the fact that he moved in at the time of the @entity36 when everyone was supposed to be on their guard , how he got in and was able to stay inside the base is very worrying			0
‘ the @entity44 must look again at its gate - keepers , its vetting and levels of access			0
’ @entity102 the @entity10 inspects the guards during a ceremony to present new colours to the @entity106 and @entity107 the @entity18 at @entity108 the @entity44 has refused to explain how @entity6 tricked his way into the barracks , but @entity4 has established that a sergeant major who left the @entity18 last year was recently called back to answer questions during an investigation into the scandal			1
a family source close to @entity6 said he was exposed when checks were carried out after a noisy party			1
@entity6 was booted off the barracks and resigned from the @entity119 , avoiding a disciplinary hearing			2
and while defence sources say he defrauded the taxpayer by living there for free , there are no plans to force him to pay accommodation charges			0
his current whereabouts are unknown			0
impersonating a member of the @entity27 is no longer an offence , but those who pass themselves off as members of the @entity27 for financial gain can be charged with fraud			1
@entity6 has not been accused of any criminal offence			1
family sources suggested last night that @entity136 may have been motivated by his father @entity137 , who served as a commando in the @entity139 , and died in 1985			0
last night an @entity44 spokesman said : ‘ when it became clear that there was no entitlement to accommodation , this individual was asked to leave @entity8			0
‘ it is wrong and misleading to suggest this was a security breach			0
the individual in question was an @entity44 employee with the correct security clearances and passes to allow entry to any @entity44 establishment			0

insurance clerk @entity6 , 42 , conned @entity18
they nicknamed him ' @entity156 ' and told him royal secrets
was only caught when checks were carried out after a noisy party
impersonating a member of the @entity27 is no longer an offence
@entity6 has not been accused of any criminal offence
