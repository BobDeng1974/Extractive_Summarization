by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:46 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 10:48 est , 23 september 2013 an amazing jetpack 30 years in the making that will let customers soar though the skies like a super hero is a step closer to being released to the public			1
test flights of @entity10 's 12th and latest prototype are underway after tweaks were made to the design to boost its performance and maneuverability			1
the machine enables a pilot to stand on a platform and use a console to control two vertical engines that mimic the behaviour of the jet engines on a aircraft and can reach a height of up to 8,000ft and travel at 45mph			1
it has been designed to be more maneuverable than its predecessor due and could be used as a first response vehicle new zealander @entity34 has created extraordinary piece of machinery in which a ' pilot ' stands on a platform at the front , using a console to control two vertical engines that mimic the behaviour of the jet engines			1
the @entity44 model is pictured the firm is is currently focused on rolling the jetpack out as a first responder vehicle while the company plans on launching the jetpack as a recreational vehice in the future , it is currently focused on rolling it out as a first responder vehicle for daring rescues and an unmanned air vehicle for heavy lifting			2
the vehicle was inspired by childhood tv shows such as @entity58 and @entity59 , according to new zealander @entity34 , who began working in his @entity61 garage 30 years ago on a device which he hoped would one day see a man speeding through the air under his own power			1
it is expected the jetpack will go on sale for commercial use for the price of a @entity72 luxury car - £ 90,000 - while a specially - fitted unit , with communications equipment for military use demands an asking price of £ 127,000			1
the company recently modified its latest @entity28 prototype to move the ducts lower and add a balance shaft to reduce vibration from the 200 hp engine			1
it said the @entity28 will be the basis for its pre-production model			1
@entity87 ’s ceo , @entity86 , said that the @entity28 prototype was a ' huge step up ' from the previous prototype			1
the company recently modified its latest @entity28 prototype ( pictured ) to move the ducts lower and add a balance shaft to reduce vibration from the 200 hp engine			1
it said the @entity28 will be the basis for its pre-production model the company 's present focus is on further improving the performance of the jetpack through some engine refinements in order to ready the jetpack for commercial sale			1
' the jetpack continues to attract interest from potential customers and investors worldwide , ' said mr @entity86 ( not pictured ) the company ’s present focus is on further improving the performance of the jetpack through some engine refinements in order to ready the jetpack for commercial sale			1
' the jetpack continues to attract interest from potential customers and investors worldwide , ' said mr @entity86			2
' we are focussing initially on developing the jetpack for use as a first responder vehicle and heavy lift unmanned air vehicle '			2
the company is also developing a jetpack simulator that will be available for sale in the next few months			1
@entity124 : the futuristic jetpack jet engines can reach a height of up to 8,000ft and travel at 45mph it is expected the jetpack will go on sale for commercial use for the price of a @entity72 luxury car - £ 90,000 - while a specially - fitted unit , with communications equipment for military use demands an asking price of £ 127,000 the jetpack is officially registered as a ' @entity139 ' , standing 2.20m and with a width 2.14m			1
its engines are 200hp and there is a 45litre fuel capacity			2
it can cover a distance of 18 miles for a period of around 30 minutes and runs on normal car petrol and two stroke oil			2
its noise is the limit of a car - @entity153 off weight : 725lb			0
pilot visibility : to be flown only by daylight and visually			0
can be flown in light rain			0
the @entity160 @entity159 confirmed that the jetpack had been issued with an experimental flight permit for development test flying , meaning that a person can be used to fly the device			1
a mixture of manned and unmanned test flights have been carried out , whereas previously the company used a dummy at the controls , while technicians on the ground have guided the jetpack by remote control			1
as part of the testing programme , engineers at the firm have made modifications to the machine 's v4 engine to make it more durable and decrease the maintenance requirements			1
they hope to have made the final adjustments to the engine by the end of this year			2
already some 30 budding @entity187 have put down deposits on the futuristic personal transport , inspired by the words of test pilot @entity191 who has flown the jetpack			1
' it 's a mixture of scary and just awesome , ' said mr @entity191 after the indoor flight			0
' flying it remotely means you can see the aircraft and so you can see everything that happens , but when you 're actually in it , it 's all behind you and you just get lifted off the ground			0
' he said there was still a ' little bit more work to do ' before the jetpack is ready to be sold but there had been ' tremendous interest ' from around the world			2
' it 's a really exciting time for us , ' said mr @entity86 chief executive of @entity87 whose company is working in partnership with @entity217 to put the final touches to the futuristic machine			2
' we have had manned flights on lots of the prototypes in varying forms but this is the first one that is totally manoeuvrable			0
' some may think that the invention is just a toy for the wealthy but the machine could have life - saving implications			0
one idea is to mount the jetpack on the back of a fire engine so it could be used by a crew member to scout hazardous areas before firefighters moved in to quell the flames he added that he was convinced that the jetpack is going to change the whole concept of light aircraft			0
' this is the motorbike of the sky , ' he said			0
he conceded that while the machine might seem like a toy for the wealthy as they zap from town house to country retreat , bosses at @entity34 believed their creation could have life - saving implications one idea , said mr @entity86 , was to mount the jetpack on the back of a fire engine so it could be used by a crew member to scout hazardous areas before firefighters moved in to quell the flames			1
it could also be used to help in the rescue of pee stranded in difficult to reach areas			0
even the @entity58 would appreciate that			0

completely average , @entity265 , @entity266 , 1 day ago this is neither a pack , nor jet powered			0
@entity269 might be a more accurate description			0
@entity271 , @entity272 , @entity266 , 1 day ago so what happens if you high in the air and something breaks ? @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity266 , 1 day ago ironically , this " jetpack " is powered by a two stroke reciprocating internal combustion engine just like a dirt bike			0
engine specification : type @entity285 two stroke displacement 2.0 litre ( 122 cu in ) bore 89 mm ( 3.50 in ) stroke 79 mm ( 3.11 in ) nominal performance 200 hp @ 6000 rpm @entity290 > 180 ftlbs 3500 - 6000 rpm features sequential fuel injection dual @entity293 @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity72 , 1 day ago sorry , but it 's just too big to be called a ' jetpack '			2
we all want something the size of a small rucksack ! @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity266 , 1 day ago i would get myself in trouble with one of those ... @entity308 , @entity309 , 1 day ago i hope he does n't drop his pee over my head ... ...			0
its about time this arrived ... ... ... ...			0
@entity315 , @entity314 , 1 day ago keep a spare on hand to rescue the first one ; ) but seriously - good on him for inventing a fun & useful craft ! @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity72 , 1 day ago i want one			0
@entity325 , @entity326 , @entity72 , 1 day ago " it could also be used to help in the rescue of pee stranded in difficult to reach areas " ... ... i protest ! ... what about all the other poor vegetables left behind ? or is the pilot allowed to " pee " while flying ? @entity334 , @entity335 , 1 day ago " it could also be used to help in the rescue of pee stranded in difficult to reach areas " @entity336 sure all pee everywhere will feel so safe and happy now ( : the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity344			0
