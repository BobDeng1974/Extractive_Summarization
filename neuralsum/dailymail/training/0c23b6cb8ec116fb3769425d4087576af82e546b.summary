by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , director of buyers ' agency @entity2 & @entity5 foreign investors are illegally buying premium property in @entity11 's most expensive suburbs and are pricing locals out of the market , a leading buyers ' agent has claimed			1
@entity2 said foreigners who did not meet residency requirements were being aided by local real estate agents and lawyers to buy large amounts of property in well - heeled areas including @entity20 and @entity21 in @entity22 's inner - east and @entity23 on @entity25 's @entity24			1
he also claimed the @entity26 ( @entity27 ) was doing nothing to stop them , and that real estate agents and lawyers were turning a blind eye because they were profiting from the sales			1
mr @entity2 , director of buyers ' agency @entity2 & @entity5 , said the investors who were predominantly from mainland @entity37 were willing to pay well above market value just to secure property in wealthy suburbs			1
in his submission to a parliamentary inquiry into foreign investment in residential real estate , mr @entity2 said he had witnessed a recent @entity20 auction where the reserve was exceeded by 30 percent			1
' there were three @entity37 nationals competing , neither spoke @entity48 or understood the process and literally just kept their hands in the air , ' he said			1
mr @entity2 told @entity1 : ' it was great for the vendor they got a big free kick but it was surreal			1
it was like the auctioneer taking money off the tree it was just silly			0
mr @entity2 claims foreign investors are illegally buying premium property in @entity11 's most expensive suburbs , including @entity25 's @entity23 ( pictured ) , and are pricing locals out of the market ' the frustration i 'm hearing from my clients is we 're not competing on equal terms			1
' if they start getting free kicks like that all the time then the market really gets out of control			0
' mr @entity2 said the issue was affecting two segments of the property market in particular â€“ high - end properties worth more than $ 10 million and inner - city properties worth between $ 1.5 million and $ 3 million			1
' it 's a domino effect because if someone down street sees a house sell for $ 12 million when it 's only worth $ 9 million then someone else with a $ 9 million house suddenly thinks it 's worth $ 12 million , ' he said			2
' there are also first home buyers trying to get in the inner city and all these apartments are being sold to people offshore			0
' we 're going to be looking at a generation of renters			0
' mr @entity2 said foreigners who did not meet residency requirements were being aided by local real estate agents and lawyers to buy large amounts of property in well - heeled areas including @entity20 and @entity21 in @entity22 's inner - east and @entity23 on @entity25 's @entity24 ( pictured ) foreigners must have residency in order to buy property in @entity11 , but mr @entity2 said the @entity27 relies on estate agents to report any wrongdoing , and mr @entity2 claimed the agents were turning a blind eye because of the higher commissions they were receiving			1
' the big problem is the vendors and agents are n't going to stop it because they want more money , ' he said			2
' lawyers are not going to dob their own clients to the @entity27			2
' he said current rules were sufficient but they needed to be enforced properly , and labelled the @entity27 a ' toothless tiger '			0
' they have n't got the resources to investigate and even if they do it 's a slap over the face with a wet lettuce , ' he said			2
mr @entity2 said proposals to impose extra stamp duty on foreign buyers would do little to discourage the investors			1
' some people will just see that as the cost of doing business in @entity11 , ' he said			2
@entity135 , executive director of the @entity136 , said he opposed charging foreign investors with extra stamp duty			2
' the first thing that should change is rules should be enforced , ' mr @entity135 said			0
' we can see foreign investment has been positive but where there are concerns the rules are n't being enforced or activity is having an effect on the market we need to understand that			0
' most people would say the @entity27 needs to collect additional detail , i think everyone is in agreement that there needs to be greater amount of fact on the table			0
' mr @entity135 added that the inquiry into foreign investment was a good thing			0
' this shines a light on the fact that we do n't know enough about the transactional detail of foreign buyers , ' he said			0
' we need to rectify that			0
' @entity1 has contacted the @entity27 for comment .			0
