where the running of @entity2 is concerned , dignity often appears to be in shorter supply than common sense			1
brace yourselves , then , for an intensification of the slanderously sleekit whispering campaign under which @entity5 has laboured for so long			1
guilty of being not quite as good a manager as he is a human being , the man whose major crime is one committed by thousands of head coaches around the world every season is about to be targeted by an immense volley of slippery slings and accusatory arrows			1
@entity5 walks away after @entity2 suffered defeat against @entity22 on friday night he ’s going , rightly and not before time			1
a man from a different era , he was never suited to the new realities of managing @entity2 in their current incarnation and reduced circumstances			2
but just walking away will never be enough for some			0
before @entity5 exits , even those who once sang his praises to the high heavens will be encouraged to join in the personal vilification of their former favourite			2
and , following the logic that the biggest lies are the easiest to sell , it will even be argued that @entity5 — a man who shouldered such an enormous burden at a time of huge crisis , suffering every step of the way during the darkest days — no longer cares if the club , his club , is pushed to the brink of extinction			1
we have surely all heard the nonsense before			0
@entity51 , he has taken more money out of @entity2 in recent years than anybody			2
the @entity2 boss is going , and not before time , but he should not be blamed for the club 's woes this is the best i can do … the absolute assertion that his demand for compensation risks plunging the club into insolvency , meanwhile , is akin to blaming the bill from the newsagents for bringing the walls of @entity70 ’s fantasy world tumbling down in 2012			1
the departure of a manager — especially one who has failed to live up to expectations — is never entirely without enmity			2
even those ‘ mutual - consent ’ deals that come complete with confidentiality clauses ca n’t stop ‘ friends ’ or ‘ insiders ’ from throwing mud , often while ensuring their own hands remain clean			0
it is obvious , moreover , that @entity5 has long since outlived his usefulness at the club he has served as player , assistant manager and now manager			1
anyone asked to give a class on how to get sacked in football should make his case study required reading			0
@entity2 fans have stood by their manager in the past , and they will not be diverted by this sideshow but spare us please , the nonsense spouted about him having personally inflicted incomparable damage to a club that has been pillaged by some of the worst corporate vandals the game has ever known			1
a support taken for granted , fleeced for every penny — and not even entrusted with the identity of some of the shadowy investors who own large chunks of their club — are smarter than to be diverted by this sideshow ahead of next monday ’s @entity113			0
tens of millions of pounds have gone			0
even at the most inflated estimation of his salary , @entity5 has n’t approached that kind of recompense for his efforts			2
as for the argument that his spending on the squad contributed to that amount , well , just do the maths ; player salaries make up only a tiny slice of recent overall losses			0
@entity5 ( second right ) has served @entity2 loyally as a player and manager , but has now outlived his use and , as he has pointed out , the football budget was set by others much further up the food chain			1
what was he supposed to do , when assured by a series of directors and chief executives that he had @entity140 amount to spend on the team ? sit on the cash and then be accused of @entity144 - like parsimony ? he spent badly , sure			0
criticise him for signing top - flight players and transforming them into lower - league cloggers , if you wish			0
but never was he given any indication that signing guys on high wages — all agreed by people chasing their next boardroom bonus , it seems — would imperil the very future of the club			0
@entity156 scores the second goal as @entity2 suffered a 2 - 0 defeat on friday night at @entity22 it ’s counter-intuitive to think that a man so visibly pained by what was done to his club would even contemplate imperilling the rebirth and rebuilding that has come at such a hefty cost			1
yet the timing and terms of his departure will occupy the thoughts of all in the @entity2 family over the coming days , the small matter of the club needing £ 8million just to reach the end of the financial year allowed to fade in the background for a little while			1
then there will be the race for a replacement , the grand unveiling and early rallying of the troops			0
all useful stuff for those who like to do their best work in the shadows .			0

@entity5 is only guilty of being a worse manager than he is a person
@entity5 has @entity2 ' best interests at heart
poor signings have cost the club , but are not the reason for financial ruin
