rather helped organize @entity5 ' plans for president @entity4 's visit to @entity15 on nov. 22 , 1963 , and as a young reporter was a key component of assassination coverage			1
now 82 , with his own show on @entity21 , he 's one of the few reporters on the story that day who 's still active in journalism			1
former @entity5 news anchor @entity7 says he has n't been asked to be part of the network 's 50th anniversary coverage due to his messy exit seven years ago amid a lawsuit rather , who later became @entity5 ' top anchor for 24 years , will appear on @entity34 's today show on nov. 22 this year			1
‘ i held off doing anything for anybody else for a while , thinking i may be asked to do something ( for @entity5 ) , ’ @entity7 said			2
‘ i ca n't say i had any reason for that hope			0
’ @entity7 worked at @entity5 for 44 years			2
his downfall came as a result of a 2004 story about president @entity45 's military service			1
under criticism , the network concluded the story could n't be substantiated , but @entity7 has stood behind it			1
his tenure as anchor ended six months later and he left @entity5 in 2006 , eventually filing a $ 70 million lawsuit against his old employers that was thrown out in 2010 by @entity54 's highest court			1
rather helped organize @entity5 ' plans for president @entity4 's visit to @entity15 on nov. 22 , 1963 , and as a young reporter was a key component of assassination coverage @entity5 said it would n't comment on @entity7			1
@entity5 @entity61 bureau chief @entity60 , who as a newspaper reporter in 1963 gave the mother of @entity64 a ride to @entity15 after the assassination , will anchor a nov. 16 special that traces @entity5 ' coverage that day			2
@entity5 ' announcement of @entity60 's special said ‘ viewers are in the moment with legendary anchor @entity72 and journalism 's iconic reporters : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			2
’ all of those men are now dead			0
‘ setting my feelings aside about it , this is not a good idea to say we want to change the historical record so we 're going to airbrush this guy out because we do n't like him , ’ @entity7 said			0
‘ they may want to control the way the public thinks about my record , but i 'm pretty sure they have not been able to do that			0
’ rather had no on - air assignment on the day @entity4 was shot , but he sprang into action when it became clear something had gone terribly wrong and then went on to become @entity5 ' top anchor for 24 years although @entity7 's name is n't mentioned in the announcement , it 's considered likely the @entity60 documentary will include 50 - year - old clips of @entity7			1
as a young @entity104 bureau chief for @entity5 in november 1963 , @entity7 had a mundane assignment in @entity15			2
he had arranged locations along the presidential motorcade route for film of the visit to be picked up and transmitted to @entity5 ' @entity54 headquarters			0
he had no on - air assignment , but sprang into action when it became clear something had gone terribly wrong			0
rather described in his 1977 book , ‘ @entity115 , ’ that @entity116 went with his report that @entity4 was dead - based not on official confirmation but his phone conversations with men who identified themselves as a doctor and priest at the hospital where @entity4 was taken , and a colleague 's conversation with the hospital 's chief of staff			0
it was an extraordinary risk : if @entity7 was wrong , he conceded his career in journalism likely would have ended there			0
@entity60 , left , will anchor a nov. 16 special that traces @entity5 ' coverage of that fateful day 50 years ago , it will feature clip of legendary anchor @entity72 days later , @entity7 was among the first people to see film of the assassination taken by @entity140 and he later described it live on @entity5 , reading from a spiral notebook what it captured of the president and first lady at the moment of impact			1
@entity5 failed , however , to acquire rights to the film			0
‘ i 'm proud of what @entity5 did at the time , ’ @entity7 said			0
‘ when the country needed it , @entity5 was the best in the business			0
’ rather gave an extensive interview about what happened that day to his old competitor , @entity34 's @entity157 , for use on @entity160 's @entity34 special to air nov. 22 .			2

@entity7 , 82 , is one of the few reporters still active in journalism today who covered the 1963 shooting
he claims he was n't *invited* to be part of @entity5 ' 50th anniversary coverage due to a failed lawsuit he brought against the network
rather left in 2006 in messy circumstances following a *controversial* story about president @entity45 's military service
he filed a $ *70million* lawsuit against his former employers but it was thrown out of @entity54 's highest court in 2010
rather has instead taken up an offer to mark the 50 anniversary by appearing on @entity186 show on nov. 22
