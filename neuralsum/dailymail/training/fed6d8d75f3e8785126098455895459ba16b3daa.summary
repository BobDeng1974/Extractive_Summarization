by @entity0 crews searching for the missing @entity3 jet launched a targeted underwater hunt for the plane 's black boxes , with just days left before the devices ' batteries are expected to run out			1
the @entity10 navy ship @entity9 , which is dragging a towed pinger locator from the @entity12 , and the @entity15 navy 's @entity13 , which has underwater search gear on board , will converge along a 150 - mile track in a desolate patch of the southern @entity20			1
more planes have also joined the search a day after leaders of the two countries co-ordinating the hunt vowed that no effort would be spared to give closure to the families of those on board			1
the @entity32 's data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by the equipment on board the ships			1
locating the data recorders and wreckage after that is possible , but incredibly difficult			1
the area the ships are searching was chosen based on hourly satellite pings the aircraft gave off after it vanished from radar on march 8 on a flight from @entity67 to @entity68			1
that information , combined with data on the estimated speed and performance of the aircraft , led them to that particular stretch of ocean , said @entity76 , the head of a joint agency co-ordinating the search			1
listening device : athe @entity10 navy ship @entity9 ( pictured ) , which is dragging the pinger locator from the @entity12 , and the @entity15 navy 's @entity13 , which has underwater search gear on board , will converge along a 150 - mile track in a desolate patch of the southern @entity20 teams are searching for two black boxes like this one which investigators hope will reveal what happened on board the doomed flight ' the area of highest probability as to where the aircraft might have entered the water is the area where the underwater search will commence , ' he said			1
' it 's on the basis of data that only arrived very recently and it 's the best data that is available			2
' air crews and ships have been searching for weeks for the @entity32 , but have so far found no trace of the plane			0
finding floating wreckage is key to narrowing the search area , as officials can then use data on ocean currents to try and backtrack to the spot where the plane entered the water - and where the coveted data recorders may be			1
those devices would provide crucial information about what condition the plane was flying under and any communications or sounds in the cockpit			0
despite weeks of fruitless searching , mr @entity76 said he had not given up hope something would be found			0
' i think there 's still a great possibility of finding something on the surface , ' he said			0
' there 's lots of things in aircraft that float			0
' a @entity137 @entity136 crew member looks out for debris from the @entity3 plane mission : search crews are now looking for the aircraft in the @entity20 , around 1,100 miles north of @entity143 , @entity10 fourteen planes and nine ships were taking part in today 's hunt across an 84,000 square mile expanse of ocean , about 1,100 miles north - west of @entity143 , the @entity144 overseeing the search said			1
the search area has shifted each day , as the investigative team continues to analyse what little radar and satellite data is available while factoring in where any debris may have drifted due to ocean currents and weather			2
' i think we 've probably got to the end of the process of analysis , ' mr @entity76 said			0
' and my expectation is that we 're into a situation where the data we 've got is the data we 've got and we 'll proceed on the basis of that			2
' location : mr @entity173 said that the government should not have allowed the international search teams to scour the @entity176 as they would have known the plane was not there he said it was unlikely that any additional pinger locators would join the search any time soon as they are in scarce supply			2
it comes as the @entity185 opposition leader claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country 's sophisticated radar system and has accused the authorities of withholding information			0
politician @entity191 said that when he was the @entity185 finance minister he had personally authorised the installation of the radar , and that the system would have picked up the missing plane changing course			0
the 66 - year - old also suggested it was possible that the @entity185 authorities had colluded in the fate of flight mh370 , and said an international committee should take over the investigation into the disappearance of the aircraft			0
' i believe the government knows more than us			0
they have the authority to instruct the air force â€¦ or @entity3 , ' he told @entity212			0
' they are privy to most of these missing bits of information critical to our understanding of this mysterious disappearance of @entity44			0
' yesterday , @entity185 prime minister @entity219 flew to @entity10 for briefings on the search for the @entity32 and to meet his @entity10 counterpart , @entity222 , whose country is overseeing the hunt			1
' it is a very difficult search - the most difficult in human history			2
but as far as @entity10 is concerned , we are throwing everything we have at it , ' mr @entity222 said .			2

@entity10 navy ship will drag listening device through search zone
joined by @entity15 navy vessel with underwater search equipment
data recorders will emit pings for around 30 days after march 8 crash
