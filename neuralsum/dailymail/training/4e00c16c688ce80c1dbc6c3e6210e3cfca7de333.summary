by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 14:34 est , 15 december 2013 @entity3 : 05:49 est , 16 december 2013 under - fire @entity5 manager @entity4 survived a crisis meeting with chairman @entity7 and technical director @entity8 after @entity5 â€™ 5 - 0 humbling at home to @entity10			1
despite backing from @entity7 in the highly - charged meeting , they are short - term guarantees and @entity4 knows he could be sacked at a moment 's notice			1
the @entity5 chairman is already sounding out potential replacements			1
@entity4 plummeted in the betting markets for next @entity19 manager to be shown the door after the defeat , which came just three weeks after the 6 - 0 thrashing at @entity23			1
the @entity5 chairman is understood to be sounding out potential replacements and @entity39 has learnt that the @entity5 chairman favours an experienced coach with @entity43 pedigree			1
@entity44 , who was at @entity45 on sunday performing tv duties , out - of - work @entity47 and @entity48 and three high - profile names in the frame			1
however , @entity4 pledged not to resign , despite admitting he has never faced a worse home loss in his career than the drubbing at the hands of @entity56 ' rampant @entity55			1
@entity10 captain @entity29 ran wild at @entity45 , scoring twice and having a hand in the goals for @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			2
and the @entity64 refused to give up on a top - four @entity19 finish			1
asked how much time he would be given at @entity5 , @entity4 said : ' that 's the only thing i ca n't control , it 's not my call so i ca n't say anything else			1
' i have to get down to work , that 's the only thing i can focus on			1
' the call to make that decision is not mine , because obviously i wo n't resign and i 'm not a quitter			2
' the only thing i can do is work hard with the players to get them back on track			2
' this is a top - four squad but in our @entity19 form we are not there			1
red alert : @entity29 was again irresistible for @entity10 and netted his side 's fourth with a cute chip blame me : @entity4 says he will shoulder the responsibility for the loss ' it 's not the points tally that 's the problem , it 's the expression of the results			1
' it 's the second expressive scoreline that we 've suffered in the season , and we admit that in the @entity19 things are n't going in any shape or form the way we want			2
' all of us had high expectations for this season , we still have them			0
again i repeat that we are not far off , but the distance is increasing for those @entity102 spots			0
' and because of the expressive result it makes it even more difficult for us to bounce back			0
' villas - @entity4 offered no argument with defeat , but felt @entity109 's second - half red card allowed @entity10 to pile on the goals , and the misery			1
confirming he would try to appeal that red card , @entity4 labelled the decision ' an extremely poor call '			1
he said : ' i think it was a bit harsh because i do n't think there was intention to hurt @entity29			0
' his foot was high , definitely a yellow card , but a straight red i think is a bit too much , because @entity109 is not that type of player			0
' i think it was an extremely poor call that has an influence , not on the victory of @entity10 but on the expressive result			0
' i will try ( to appeal the red card ) , hopefully there can be some sensitivity into it			0
' shot shy : spurs failed to muster a single shot on target , much to the frustration of @entity137 marching orders : referee @entity139 sends off @entity109 after he left @entity29 stricken on the ground @entity10 manager @entity56 heaped praised on striker @entity29 , hinting that captaincy can bring the best out of the prolific @entity143 forward			0
@entity29 's brace took his @entity19 goals tally to 17 for the season , but @entity56 was most concerned with his leadership skills			2
@entity56 said : ' this is a guy who has captained one of the most iconic clubs in @entity153 football in @entity154 , so it 's nothing new to him			2
' i wanted to have someone who could represent me and the club in that tunnel , before even stepping on the pitch			0
' when @entity29 has the armband on ready to go out , everyone knows this is a team ready to fight			0
' he was great in the changing room , i told him a few days back i wanted him to lead this club and that it was an honour for him			0
' i think he enjoyed it and today you 've seen his performance level			0
' hailing his side 's dominance in every area , @entity56 said : ' i loved their arrogance with the ball today			2
' they were a real threat with the ball all day			0
' in winning teams everyone supports each other , and this was a result achieved without our captain @entity183			0
' when we have that focus and concentration we 're a very good side			0
