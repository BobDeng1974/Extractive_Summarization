a @entity1 furniture shopping mall which invited the public to release butterflies back to nature has seen the event ended up in a complete opposite direction â€“ hundreds of colourful creatures were stamped to death by onlookers who hoped to capture them			1

tragedy : hundreds of butterflies were stamped to death during an event to release them back into the wild set free : 10 families were selected from thousands of in the crowd to release the butterflies from shoe boxes keen participants : the butterflies were transported in the cardboard boxes from @entity18 on the same day			1
as soon as they were let into the air , crowd started chasing and trying to capture them the ceremony , named ' freeing of @entity41 ' , attracted thousands of @entity14 citizens who eagerly awaited the release of the insects			1
ten families were selected from thousands in the crowd to release the butterflies into the air			0
however , after the butterflies were released , many of them settled on the large stage			0
this resulted in excited onlookers and their children chasing and trying to capture the butterflies with many people treading on them without realising			1
eventually there were shouted warnings that the butterflies were being trampled underfoot , but it came too late for hundreds of squashed creatures			2
picture time : some participants were so busy taking photos that they did n't realise many butterflies had been stamped to death on the ground organisers said some butterflies failed to take off properly because they had just arrived from tropical @entity18 where the temperature was higher than @entity14 and so they were slightly sleepy			1
event staff picked up as many of the grounded insects as they could and put them back into their boxes to be returned to a sanctuary			2
