christians may have to sacrifice their jobs if they want to express their religion at work , government lawyers declared yesterday			1
they urged human rights judges in @entity6 to reject a landmark case brought by four @entity1 who said they suffered faith - based discrimination			1
the state lawyers insisted workers are not entitled to wear a crucifix at work against the wishes of their employers – and if that is incompatible with their faith they ‘ are free to resign ’			1
he even pledged to change the law to ‘ make clear that people can wear religious symbols at work			1
’ last night the government ’s handling of the case was attacked by @entity1 for its ‘ astonishing double standards ’			1
government lawyers said the wearing of the crucifix was not a ‘ scriptural requirement ’ of @entity46 , so employers had no obligation to recognise it			2
@entity19 sits besides bishop @entity47 , as she waits for the beginning of the hearing but in a confrontation at the court yesterday , the @entity1 ’ counsel said it was wrong they should have fewer rights than other faith groups just because they had a ‘ tolerant ’ religion			1
the hearing at the @entity26 involved four test cases , two of which involve employees prevented from wearing a cross at work			1
@entity19 ’s row with @entity65 led the airline to back down in 2006 and @entity67 who – after 30 years as a nurse – was told she could no longer wear her cross on duty for health and safety reasons			1
former @entity76 registrar @entity74 , left , who was sacked after declining to conduct civil partnerships , and @entity67 , a nurse of 30 years who was told that she could no longer wear her cross to work , were also involved in yesterday 's case in @entity6 the other two cases are those of @entity74 , who was sacked as a registrar by @entity76 council because she declined to conduct civil partnerships and @entity87 , a @entity89 counsellor who lost his job in @entity91 after admitting to bosses that he felt unable to give sex therapy to gays			1
@entity19 , @entity67 , @entity74 and @entity87 ( pictured clockwise ) who launched a landmark case on religious freedom at the @entity26 yesterday the case comes at a time when senior @entity1 leaders , including the archbishops of the @entity102 and the @entity103 , have complained that @entity46 is being pushed out of public life in @entity20			1
@entity105 , for @entity106 and mr @entity107 , said : ‘ these are real people , real lives , real damage suffered			0
there is no knowing where this will end as society moves in a secular direction			0
the situation in the @entity20 is now critical			0
’ but @entity118 , acting for the government , told the judges that none of the four @entity1 had suffered any form of discrimination			2
‘ there is a difference between the professional sphere where your religious beliefs conflict with other interests and the private sphere , ’ he said			2
‘ everyone has the right to express their beliefs , including the right to display religious symbols , but not an absolute right or a right without limits			2
that does not mean that in their professional sphere anyone can manifest their religious belief in any way they choose			0
’ he said that under @entity149 human rights rules , people were allowed to practise their religion in a ‘ generally recognised form ’			0
however , they could not ask to express their religion in ways which were not a ‘ scriptural requirement ’			0
prime minister @entity28 told the @entity154 earlier this year that the right to wear the cross at work was ' an absolutely vital freedom ' he said : ‘ employees are free to resign if they find their employment incompatible with their religious beliefs ’ , adding : ‘ they can obtain alternative employment in which they can reflect their religion as they wish			1
’ in the case of @entity169 , 61 , from @entity170 , south - west @entity167 , wearing a cross was ‘ a personal expression of faith and not a response to a scriptural command ’			0
mrs @entity67 , 57 , he added , had been told not to wear her cross because of new health and safety rules at @entity178			2
of registrar @entity180 , mr @entity179 said @entity76 believed same - sex couples should have equal access to services and ‘ this is a legitimate , even a weighty , aim for a public authority ’			0
for @entity169 , @entity185 said that @entity65 allowed @entity186 to wear hijabs , @entity188 to wear turbans and bracelets , and @entity191 to wear skull caps			0
last night @entity193 of the @entity194 said : ‘ the government ’s double standards in their handling of these four cases has been astonishing			0
‘ the pm says one thing to the media and in @entity202 and yet shuns such statements at the most critical time , in legal submissions to the @entity26			0
’ the court is likely to take several months before making a ruling .			0

claims that four @entity1 were refused the right to express beliefs at work to be rejected
those who *disobey* employers should ' go and find another job '
hard line means that @entity196 does *n't* support right to wear a cross at work
