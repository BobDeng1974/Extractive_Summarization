@entity1 ’s future at @entity2 remains in grave doubt after it emerged manager @entity4 has increasing reservations about his technical ability			1
@entity1 has endured a difficult start to his career at @entity9 and is yet to score a goal in the @entity12 club this season			1
doubts have existed about the @entity17 forward 's attitude , hunger and desire ever since he first played in @entity20 for @entity21 three years ago and his performances for @entity2 have done nothing to persuade his critics otherwise			0
@entity2 's @entity1 is yet to score for @entity2 in the @entity12 @entity2 manager @entity4 and @entity1 have a discussion during training @entity4 has serious doubts about @entity1 's technical ability the striker missed the @entity32 win at @entity33 with a groin injury but now it has emerged that @entity4 is beginning to have more fundamental issues with @entity1 after admitting privately that he has concerns about whether the striker is good enough to lead his attack			1
@entity2 won 3 - 1 at @entity33 without @entity1 on wednesday in the @entity32 and went into last sunday ’s game at @entity40 – that they lost 3 - 0 – without a recognised centre forward in the team			1
with young winger @entity44 scoring twice at @entity33 and finding himself in a host of scoring positions during the game at @entity40 , it would appear @entity1 is close to becoming surplus to requirements at @entity9			2
the @entity50 did look sharper after coming on as a substitute at @entity40 last sunday and was perhaps unlucky to find home goalkeeper @entity52 in such good form			0
@entity1 came on as a second - half substitute in @entity2 's 3 - 0 defeat against @entity40 @entity1 's attitude and hunger was questioned during his previous spell in @entity20 with @entity21 @entity59 ' @entity1 must help himself ' - @entity60 nevertheless , @entity4 hopes to welcome main striker @entity61 back to fitness in the new year and also has @entity63 to consider			1
@entity63 has also had his own problems since joining @entity2 but has been used a little more by @entity4 in recent games			2
recently , @entity4 admitted that the decision to buy @entity1 towards the back end of the summer transfer window had been a gamble			1
he said : ' i felt it was a risk we needed to take with @entity1 because , as a group , we could n’t afford not to at that time			0
' it was obviously late on and we needed to have someone in			0
it ’s something that we ca n’t regret now			0
i made it clear at the beginning it was a calculated risk - and that is why he probably cost the money he did			0
' @entity2 have previously denied suggestions that they will try to sell @entity1 in the january transfer window .			2
