by @entity0 parents are petitioning against @entity2 for labelling too many products - from potatoes to fruit juice - with the unlikely warning ' may contain nuts '			1
mothers of children with nut allergies have complained that it is ' almost impossible ' to feed their offspring if they take the over-cautious policy at its word			2
more than 12,500 people have signed a petition calling for the supermarket giant to ' stop using blanket ' may contain nuts ' labels '			1
parents are petitioning against @entity2 for labelling too many products - from potatoes to fruit juice - with the unlikely warning ' may contain nuts ' it was launched by @entity25 , from @entity26 , after she said that @entity2 ' dramatically changed its labelling policy '			1
she said : ' suddenly , many previously safe foods are now apparently unsafe as they have ‘ may contain nuts ’ on them			0
' these products literally changed their allergy information overnight			2
' we recognise there will be risk in some foods , such as chocolate and biscuits			0
' however , when you attempt a weekly shop for your family and find that everything from baked beans to pizza , butternut squash , potatoes , fruit juice and more are suddenly labelled as being potentially unsafe it is very disruptive and leaves you with extremely limited options for feeding your family			1
' @entity2 said that the foods would previously have been marked as having been made in factories where nuts were also used			2
but it told the @entity54 that the need for a larger font has changed the warning			1
new rules come into effect in december which will make the labelling of possible food allergens compulsory			2
ms @entity25 added : ' rather than making a genuine and careful assessment of the risks , it appears that @entity2 is using a blanket ' may contain nuts ' policy as a legal disclaimer and to avoid having to implement the proper controls to ensure even staple items of food are safe for our children			1
@entity2 said that the foods would previously have been marked as having been made in factories where nuts were also used , but the need for a larger font has changed the warning ' i am calling on @entity2 to act now to change its labelling procedures to ensure they are true reflections of risk			1
they need transparent traceability for all ingredients so a may contain label is only used with real need			0
the guidance is to prevent blanket statements - yet this appears to be the stance @entity2 is taking			2
' @entity2 told the paper that it takes great care to label its products with allergy advice where necessary			1
it added : ' we only display these warnings where there is a risk of cross-contamination			0
' up to ten people a year die from reactions caused by coming into contact with even minute quantities of peanuts			0
peanut allergy , which is now thought to affect at least one in 50 children , can cause serious breathing problems			0
the most severely affected could experience a life - threatening anaphylactic shock or even die when exposed to just a trace of the nuts in their food			0
sufferers have to carry an @entity115 , an autoinjector to administer adrenaline in an emergency			0
but the fear of accidental exposure can reduce their quality of life and severely limit the social activities of allergic individuals , their families and even their friends .			0

@entity2 labels ' butternut squash , potatoes , fruit juice ' with warning
