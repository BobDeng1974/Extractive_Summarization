by @entity0 ode to the poets : presenter @entity2 has asked the @entity3 to commission a programme on the poetry of @entity7 poets @entity8 host @entity2 hopes to turn his attentions from the power of cars to the power of words , with a special programme about @entity7 poets to mark this year 's centenary			1
may hopes to convince @entity3 bosses to commission the programme , which would include the poetry of @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , among others			1
during an interview for forces radio @entity25 , which was recorded while visiting troops at @entity28 in @entity29 ahead of tonight 's @entity8 , the 51 - year - old presenter said : ' i 've put it forward - i have n't heard from them yet , weirdly obviously this year is the centenary of the outbreak of @entity7			1
' but i thought for the first year we could commemorate the @entity37 truce of 1914 when they all got out of the trenches and played football and swapped gifts and so on - and we could do that through the words of the war poets and the people who kept diaries and postcards and things			0
' may , who first co-presented @entity8 in 1999 , added : ' the words of the really big poets like @entity20 , ( @entity53 ) @entity52 and @entity19 have endured , while a lot of the other things about it , the understanding of it , is fading away			2
' those words may be the bit that survive the longest , and actually tell us a great deal about it in a very short space of time and very few words - which is what poetry is about , it 's about imagery and stuff			0
' @entity19 , who was killed in action just one week before the signing of the @entity71 on november 4 , 1918 , is best remembered for his shocking and realistic war poetry about the horrors of trench warfare			2
this was in stark contrast to the usually patriotic verses penned by other war poets , such as @entity21			0
among his best known works , which were published posthumously , are @entity80 and @entity81			0
two voices : @entity21 's patriotic poetry was idealistic compared to works by @entity19 @entity19 was heavily influenced by his friend and mentor @entity20 , who survived the @entity7 and was awarded the @entity87 for his service			1
described as an ' accidental hero ' , @entity20 's initial innocence soon diminished against the harsh realities of war , as seen in such poems as the darkly - titled , suicide in the @entity95			0
away from presenting @entity8 with @entity97 and @entity98 , may 's other television credits include @entity99 , which looked at his favourite childhood toys and a number of drink - inspired journeys with wine expert @entity103			0
anniversary : this year marks 100 years since the @entity7 began			1
