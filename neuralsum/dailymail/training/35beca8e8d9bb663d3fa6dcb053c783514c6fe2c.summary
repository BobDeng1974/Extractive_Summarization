@entity19 : early humans were using toothpicks almost 1.8million years ago , scientists have discovered basic : researchers found that gum disease among hominids , whose remains were found in a region of southern @entity9 , was caused by what is thought to have been a basic form of toothpick although they had previously used the hominid teeth to discern what individuals ate and their age , this is the first time that they have been able to offer an explanation for the differences in hominid teeth			1
they studied the remains because they believed that the wear and malformations could n't be caused by genetics			2
some scientists had previously believed that the differences were caused by variations between sexes while others thought they might have been indicative of different species			1
@entity47 , from the @entity48 , told the @entity49 : ' progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual 's lifetime			0
' variations : researchers say that their findings shed some light on why the mandibles , or jaws , of the primitive humans were so varied in shape research : some scientists had previously believed that the differences were caused by variations between sexes while others thought they might have been indicative of different species ms @entity47 added that the group had found a small lesion between the teeth and the gums of one of the jaws examined			1
' the individual who was using a toothpick was young , as his or her teeth were not worn down			0
there was a small cylinder - shaped lesion - in this area , if you place a toothpick it goes through			0
' one of the jaws examined had lost all of his or her teeth except for one canine			2
it is thought he or she was able to survive by using tools to mash up food			0
the study was carried out on well preserved remains found at @entity100 between 1991 and 2005			1
the bones belong to the earliest proto - humans known to exist outside of @entity103			2
@entity100 hominids had slightly smaller brains that us , walked upright and used tools			0
they were initially thought to be a separate species of @entity110 but are now referred to as homo erectus georgicus			0
the remains were discovered by @entity113 in 1991 .			0

but the crude early *dentistry* actually made their teeth fall out and is believed to be the first example of *over-zealous* *brushing*
researchers made the discovery in hominid remains found in a region of south @entity9
the remains are the earliest discovered primitive human life outside of @entity103
the research *solves* the previously *unexplained* *mystery* in variations in early human jaws
