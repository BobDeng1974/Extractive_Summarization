by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 15:02 est , 10 may 2013 carbon dioxide levels have reached its highest throughout human history , recent figures from a @entity6 monitoring station show			1
the level in our atmosphere is now at a record high 400 parts per million , prompting renewed warnings of the ‘ huge risks ’ of climate change			2
the shocking figures , which have risen from 270ppm before the @entity15 , is a result of human activity such as burning of fossil fuels and deforestation			2
danger : carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere is now at a record high 400 parts per million , and now experts warn of the risks of climate change the preliminary figures have come from the @entity29 and @entity30 ( @entity31 ) monitoring station in @entity33			1
the greenhouse gas has not been at such high levels for around three million years			1
the prehistoric climate had anaverage temperatures were @entity41 higher and sea levels were around 20 metres above what they are today , @entity36 of the @entity37 at @entity38 , said			2
‘ we are creating a prehistoric climate in which human societies will face huge and potentially catastrophic risks			0
‘ only by urgently reducing global emissions will we be able to bring carbon dioxide levels down and avoid the full consequences of turning back the climate clock by three million years , ’ he said			1
time for change : experts warned the high levels could ' turn back the climate clock ' three million years have have a serious effect on our planet 's future big change : the extreme rise in @entity64 levels in the atmosphere began before the @entity15 mid- 18th century @entity68 @entity67 executive director @entity66 said : ‘ our common future is now bound up with this one simple measurement , the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere , and it now stands well above what some of our greatest scientific minds say is safe			1
‘ the implications are grave , we 're facing major adverse planetary changes , our seasons are shifting faster than we thought possible , but even now there is still cause for hope			0
‘ last year @entity82 installed more pollution - free renewable energy than coal , and it was the same in the @entity6			0
the tools exist to halt the relentless loading of our atmosphere with heat - trapping gases , all we need to do is tap the ingenuity of humankind to deploy them			0
’ and @entity92 , chief executive of @entity93 , said : ‘ the milestone we 've just reached is a reminder that we are heading in the wrong direction in terms of dealing with climate change			0
‘ it challenges us all to come to terms with the fact that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground and that , instead , we need to switch to renewable alternatives if we want to avoid dangerous climate change in the future			0

carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere now at record high 400ppm
greenhouse gas levels have been rising since the @entity15
experts warned this ' turns back climate clock ' three million years
