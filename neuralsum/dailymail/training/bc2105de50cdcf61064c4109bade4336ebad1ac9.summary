devastated @entity6 , 37 , suffered heart failure after developing a serious chest infection in december 2010			1
the former @entity10 dog handler , who served in the second @entity2 , was fitted with a @entity12 ( @entity12 ) which pumps blood around his body while he waits for a heart transplant			2
support : former @entity10 police dog handler , @entity6 , 37 , developed heart failure two years ago and is kept alive by a machine , yet benefits staff have told him he 's fit to work ' 15 seconds from death ' : @entity6 with his lvad machine			1
if it fails , he will soon die the machine connects a pump to his heart which is attached to a battery he carries around with him 24 hours a day			2
if the machine fails or becomes disconnected from the battery @entity6 has just 15 seconds before his heart stops beating			1
despite becoming exhausted after walking a few yards he had his @entity31 ( @entity31 ) of £ 420 - a - month axed after @entity33 officials ruled he could get a job			1
bizarrely , @entity6 , who left the @entity10 in 2008 to work for the probation service helping reformed criminals , still qualifies for the highest rate of disability allowance of £ 520 - a - month			1
tired : even walking his dog tank is an exhausting ordeal for @entity6 divorced @entity6 , who has two sons , @entity43 , 12 , and eight - year - old @entity44 who live with his ex-wife , said : ' i feel like my integrity and honesty is being questioned			1
' i did not want to claim benefits anyway but i did so out of necessity			0
' if my machine was to fail i would pass out within 15 seconds and i would die quite quickly			1
' i am 15 seconds away from death at any time			1
' my life ended when my heart failed - this machine allows me to exist but not to live			1
he added : ' the fight will just start again if i get a transplant - you are on drugs for the rest of your life			1
' i wish for a transplant but that is just the next fight starting			0
' going out to work physically drains me			2
after a day 's work , i need to rest up completely for three days			2
i 'm a physical wreck			0
' @entity6 , who lives in a rented house in @entity69 with fiance @entity70 , 29 , a teacher at a school for pupils with behavioural problems , had his benefits stopped following a physical assessment in @entity69 on october 24			1
he said : ' i had a call from the @entity33 on october 23 asking me to come for an assessment the next day which i had no problem with , i 've never had anything to hide			0
' but when i got to the assessment centre the officials said that because i had walked unaided into the centre that i was fit to work			1
' i explained about my heart failure and even showed them the lvad machine			1
the woman asked me what it did and i simply said " if it stops i 'm dead "			0
' i get very tired very easily and it hurts me to accept that i am unable to work because of my condition			2
lifesaver : the @entity12 machine pumps blood around @entity6 's body as his heart failed in 2010 he added : ' the report said it was not accepted that i had limited capability to work			1
' i have not been able to pay for my kids since i have been ill , my partner is having to financially support us both			0
' i tried going back to work this year for 16 hours a week but it was too much strain			2
' i see my kids for one night every two weeks and then i am exhausted			0
' i love taking my dogs for walks , but i ca n't take them very far before i am out of energy			0
my machine pumps my blood around the body at a constant speed			0
' when i do anything that would usually increase my heart rate the machine continues at the same speed			0
' that is why i tire so quickly and remain exhausted for days after any physical activity			0
' operation : the war hero is waiting for a heart transplant , but even then he faces a long road to recovery eight years ago @entity6 was diagnosed with an irregular heart beat but after a virus in 2010 , his condition worsened and he almost died when his heart failed completely			1
he is now kept alive by a machine woven through his ribs to a pump in his heart which keeps his blood flowing at a constant speed			0
he added : ' my heart failed and i was in intensive care for 16 weeks and died several times - they opened me up 11 times			2
' i went into hospital as a 20 stone muscular man and i lost 70 per cent of my muscle and about nine stone			0
' i even had to learn to walk again			0
but yet i am still told i am not disabled enough to work			2
' a @entity33 spokesperson said : ' @entity31 assesses someone 's capacity for work and looks at what a person can do because we know conditions affect different people in different ways			0
' a decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken following a thorough face - to - face assessment and after consideration of all the supporting medical evidence provided by the claimant			2
' we have made considerable improvements to the @entity161 to make it fairer and more effective			0
' if someone disagrees with the outcome of their claim , they have the right to submit new evidence and appeal			0

@entity6 suffered heart failure but has been told he is fit to work
he claims he becomes seriously exhausted by even the smallest efforts
if his life - saving device breaks he has just 15 seconds to live
