investigators in @entity86 's case have long been focused on @entity9 , who had been dating the boy 's baby sitter and later served the time in @entity13 for molesting two other boys			1
@entity86 's disappearance prompted a massive search that stretched as far as @entity92 and spawned the national movement to publicize the cases of missing children			2

his lawyer , @entity122 , has said @entity119 is mentally ill , and authorities have not cited any additional evidence to implicate him beyond his own admission			0
prosecutors are expected this month to announce whether they believe there 's evidence enough to continue pursuing a case against @entity119 , who worked at a convenience store near @entity86 's home when the boy disappeared and told police he strangled the boy and stuffed his body in a trash bag			1
