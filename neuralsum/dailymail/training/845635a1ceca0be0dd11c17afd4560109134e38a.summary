@entity0 scored his first goals in @entity3 football to give @entity4 a 2 - 1 win away at @entity6 on saturday night			1
the 27 - year - old gave the visitors the lead on 14 minutes with a low , blistering strike that beat @entity6 goalkeeper @entity11			2
the hosts drew level when @entity14 fortuitously deflected a @entity16 clearance into the net 15 minutes later			1
however , @entity0 had the last laugh just after the hour mark when his shot deflected off @entity20 to restore their advantage			1

host commentator thanks for joining me for @entity30 's live coverage of @entity4 's 2 - 1 win at @entity6			1
read @entity33 ' match report here			1
they 've done it ! @entity4 go above @entity36 and back into third place in the @entity39 table			1
@entity0 's double was enough for @entity4 , who had been pegged back after a bizarre goal from @entity14 in the first half			1
@entity45 handles the ball inside his own area , @entity6 players surround the referee but their pleas are ignored			2
i 've seen those given ... i 'm not sure @entity52 will ever come good for @entity6			2
he 's weak , slowand & has n't got a trick ( which works )			2
and this has been one of his better games ... @entity57 is left in a heap after a challenge but there 's no free - kick and a drop ball is played			2
four minutes of added time to be played			2
the visitors are showing very little ambition - understandably so - in these last few minutes			2
@entity66 wins it back in the middle of midfield to start yet another attack			1
more possession and more balls into the box from @entity6 but still no breakthrough			2
saints are heading everything clear and blocking every through ball			2
another dangerous ball from @entity66 - this time from a free - kick 35 yards out - is headed out for a corner			2
@entity6 take it quickly but @entity52 's shot is well wide			2
@entity0 will not complete his hat - trick today - the winger has gone off for youngster @entity85			1
@entity86 replaces @entity87 with 10 minutes to go			2
@entity88 comes within six inches of sealing three points but his header - from a brilliant @entity92 cross - smashed @entity11 's bar before being hoofed clear			1
the hosts are whipping more and more balls into @entity4 's area as the game goes on and the latest almost gave them an equaliser			1
@entity87 got his head to a @entity66 cross but somehow managed to head wide from just a few yards			2
he 's been a nuisance for @entity6 's defence all evening and @entity88 has just proved his worth at the other end of the pitch			2
the @entity105 flicked away an inswinging corner from @entity66 with @entity107 under pressure			2
@entity6 have turned to @entity109 to rescue something here			2
i watched @entity36 's reserves earlier in the week and @entity109 - who is just back from a knee injury - looked very sharp			1
@entity115 will be hoping he and @entity116 - still without a league goal for the club - can help salvage at least a point			0
newcastle bring on @entity109 and @entity116 for @entity121 and @entity14			1
@entity20 had been talking to @entity122 compatriot @entity0 just moments before he gifted the @entity4 winger his second of the match			1
it was certainly very pally of @entity20 to allow @entity0 to rob him of the ball before poking past @entity11 , another @entity127 international			1
@entity128 gets booked for dragging back @entity121			2
just like his first , @entity0 gets a goal out of nothing			1
the @entity122 ran onto a flick from @entity57 , bundled his way past @entity20 and unleashed a shot which took a wicked deflection off the @entity6 man to beat @entity11			0
2 - 1 to @entity4			1
a superb cross from @entity137 was met by @entity14 but the @entity138 could only flick his header wide of @entity107 's right - hand post			1
he 'll be frustrated with that			0
@entity57 and @entity142 replace @entity143 and @entity144 with 30 minutes left on the clock			0
more good work from @entity92 down @entity4 's right side			1
the @entity3 man fired in a cross after a good run but @entity151 got his head on it to clear the danger			0
looks like @entity4 will make their first substitution shortly , although it 's not yet clear who is coming on			1
@entity158 clearly feels his side need something different to go on and win this game			0
@entity162 heads the ball across to @entity52 on the edge of @entity4 's area but the midfielder 's volley ended up well over @entity107 's bar			1
it was a tricky chance but he should 've kept it down			0
the visitors are looking assured in possession , knocking it around their back - four and trying to play their way through @entity6			2
the hosts , on the other hand , look more at home using their width on the counter-attack			0
difficult to tell which way this one is going to go			0
a nice piece of skill from @entity88 on the left almost sets @entity185 away but @entity6 snuff out the danger			0
@entity188 crowd very quiet in the opening minutes of the second half			1
@entity14 's fortunate goal sees @entity6 go in level after @entity0 's first strike fr @entity4			1
all to play for after the break			0
@entity162 wins a corner for the hosts but it comes to nothing			0
saints look happy to see the opening period out as it is			0
@entity4 break through @entity0 after another weak penalty shout for a @entity45 handball but @entity6 win the ball back and immediately go on the attack			1
@entity204 latches onto a precise ball over the top but he could n't direct his first - time effort on target			0
howls of anger from the @entity188 faithful as @entity162 goes down in the box after a tackle from @entity92			1
the @entity3 man did get a touch on the ball though			0
correct decision not to award a penalty			0
@entity14 attempts to score his second goal of the game - and first he intended - but his 30 - yard effort is miles over the bar			1
he 'd have been better off passing , there			0
@entity115 certainly let @entity143 know exactly what he thought about the @entity228 's attempt to get @entity137 booked			0
at one point i thought he was going to enter the pitch and drag @entity143 to his feet			0
from the resulting free - kick the @entity4 winger was flagged offside , much to @entity115 's satisfaction ... @entity137 goes in hard on @entity143 by the touchline but manages to escape a booking			1
moments later the @entity4 midfielder is involved with the referee himself			1
@entity16 slid in to try and clear the ball but diverted it onto the net of @entity14 and into an empty net			1
huge slice of luck for @entity115 's men			0
@entity144 's wicked free - kick from out on the right found the head of @entity45 but the big defender could only direct his header over the bar			0
he 'll be disappointed with that after getting away from the clutches of @entity151			0
at the other end @entity14 is flagged for offside			1
the visitors work the ball down the right , @entity143 crosses but @entity88 ca n't get on the end of it			0
@entity4 have really settled into the game now			1
i once scored a penalty past @entity107 during a kickabout when he was a teenager at the club 's academy			2
he did , however , recover from that humiliation and is currently keeping his old club at bay			0
he really is a top keeper and , for me , should be @entity3 's no 1			0
lots more possession for the @entity4 since @entity0 's goal , which was completely against the run of play			1
that strike seems to have given @entity158 's men a shot of confidence and they 're now knocking the ball about with some style			0
out of nowhere @entity4 take the lead through new boy @entity0			1
a long ball was knocked down by @entity88 to @entity285 , who picked out the run of @entity0 with a perfectly - weighted pass			1
the @entity122 made no mistake from 12 yards but @entity11 will feel he should 've done better			0
another decent move from @entity6 ends with the ball at the feet of @entity204			0
the former @entity294 man got a shot away but @entity107 was down low to make a comfortable save			0
@entity158 's men are closing down quickly and keeping their shape as you 'd expect but they 're struggling to keep hold of the ball for more than a few passes			0
@entity88 very isolated so far			0
the hosts are enjoying the majority of possession in the early stages , with @entity52 getting on the ball three or four times down the right already			0
he looks to be in the mood , just like he was at @entity309 last week			0
@entity6 have started reasonably brightly here			0
their second chance of the game fell to right back @entity20 , whose low strike looked to be on target before it was blocked			2
@entity315 just let the ball run under his foot for a @entity4 throw			1
caretaker boss @entity115 could be seen in the background telling his players to relax			0
a typically powerful run through the middle from @entity162 ends with the ball reaching @entity52 out on the right			0
the @entity138 found @entity326 with his cut - back but the midfielder 's shot was sliced terribly and almost went out for a throw - in before the ball was kept in			2
do n't under - estimate the significance of this game for @entity115			0
win this and i would think he could be put in charge until the end of the season			0
@entity4 get us underway at @entity188			1
we 're a little over five minutes away from kick - off at @entity188 , which means @entity4 's players have almost certainly whacked on these snazzy yellow kits by now			1
speaking ahead of kick - off at @entity188 , @entity4 boss @entity158 said : ' we know they are strong , but it is tough to beat us			1
' winning games is the best medicine			0
we miss some good players but for others it 's an opportunity			0
' they need a win , the last few games they 've had some defeats and they are at home			0
