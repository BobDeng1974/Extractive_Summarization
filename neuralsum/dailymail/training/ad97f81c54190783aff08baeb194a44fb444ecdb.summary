it was once @entity1 's longest lake bridge , stretching for nearly two miles across the surface of @entity3 and providing a crucial transport link for those who lived there			1
as the lake level rose it disappeared into a watery grave , buried under the surface for almost 400 years , but now a prolonged drought means it emerges during the dry season			1
for the last two years visitors have travelled to see the @entity15 creation as it appears among the mud in the @entity3 basin , in @entity19 province , south east @entity1			1
built during the reign of the last @entity15 emperor , it served as a key link between the large towns and small fishing villages that surrounded the water			0
the @entity3 lake serves as an important part of @entity15 history , as that is where the first @entity15 emperor won victory over the @entity52 in 1363 , effectively beginning the dynasty			2
this granite bridge was one of around 1,000 such bridges built across the one lake during the end of the @entity15 reign			2
@entity3 is @entity1 's largest freshwater lake , and at is annual peak usually covers an area twice the size of @entity63			1
relic : the walkway was known as ' thousand eye bridge ' because it used to have 1,100 holes along its length , and was completed during the rule of the last @entity15 emperor dried up : the level of @entity3 varies hugely depending on the season , but for the last several years it has struggled to fill itself during winter , and has all but disappeared during the dry season @entity73 by the @entity75 its size varies wildly depending on the season , but in recent years it has been struggling to fill itself during winter , and all but disappearing in summer			1
water levels currently sit at 32ft ( 10m ) and have fallen to the same level each year since 2012			0
@entity1 authorities point to a prolonged dry spell that has affected the region , but locals also point to the creation of the massive @entity85 further up the river			0
the dam stores water in the winter to help keep the turbines running during the dry season , and observers are concerned this is depriving the lake of the water it needs to survive			2
damaged : @entity1 authorities have blamed the dried up lake on a prolonged drought , but locals point to the creation of the @entity85 along the @entity75 , which feeds the lake , as the cause disappearing : during the dry season the lake level has dropped below ten metres ( 32ft ) at its lowest point , devastating the local fishing industry ( pictured , the lake at its peak ) whatever the cause , the impact on the locals has been devastating			1
the fishing industry has been ruined as dead fish are left washed up on the lake 's banks as the waters recede			0
@entity3 is also a major breeding site for migratory birds who arrive in the summer and rely on the lake for food while they mate			0
last year authorities were forced to air - drop shrimp , maize , and small fish on to the dry lake bed in order to feed the birds .			0

bridge is two miles long and once sat on surface of @entity3 , @entity1
however it sank *underwater* for almost 400 years after lake level rose
now drought means that granite *slabs* *reappear* during the dry season
