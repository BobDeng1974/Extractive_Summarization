a 24 - year - old woman has up to 50 orgasms a day due to a rare medical condition which leaves her constantly aroused			1
@entity3 , who suffers from @entity4 , says the condition has almost ruined her life			1
her uncontrolled orgasms can be triggered by anything from riding in a car to a loud bass			1
scroll down for @entity11 @entity3 , with boyfriend @entity12 , suffers from @entity4 - meaning she can orgasm uncontrollably up to 50 times a day miss @entity3 said : ' it can happen anywhere and sometimes i 'll have five back to back			1
' it 's not pleasurable - it has become like torture			0
i 've been living with it since i was six			0
' for years , she suffered in silence , too ashamed to tell friends or family			2
she said : ' i can have 50 orgasms in one day and five or ten within an hour of each other			1
' it happens when i 'm with my friends or out in public and it 's very embarrassing			0
miss @entity3 suffered in silence for years because she was too ashamed to confide in friends , family or a doctor ' it kills me inside			1
i just have to put on a smile and pretend that nothing 's wrong			0
' once at the point of despair , she is now turning her life around after finding love - and much needed medical treatment , after battling doctors who did n't understand @entity4 or how to treat it			1
miss @entity3 said : ' since last year i 've been on a quest to find out more about this condition			1
' it 's been one disappointment after another thanks to the reluctance of some doctors to see this as a valid condition			2
' but after making contact with pelvic pain expert dr @entity57 , she hopes she has found a way to control her orgasms			2
miss @entity3 said : ' after seeing dr echenberg i found there are things which can reduce the intensity of the orgasms - even though they are still constant			1
' i take medication to numb the areas and do exercise to try to take me mind of it			0
taking control over the disorder rather then it controlling me is a dream come true			0
however , under doctors ' orders , miss @entity3 and her boyfriend @entity12 , 22 , must abstain from sexual contact			1
the couple met seven months ago on a dating website			0
and despite previously having sex to cope when her symptoms were bad , she must now stay celibate			2
she said : ' it was difficult at first to explain my disorder to @entity12			0
i was n't sure when was the right time or how he was going to react			2
' but he 's so supportive , he completely understands and he is just my rock			0
since seeking help a year ago , miss @entity3 is slowly getting her condition under control			1
she also has treatment from physical therapist @entity91 ( pictured ) ' @entity12 's really been holding me back as far as the intimacy goes - he actually has to remind me we 're not allowed to do anything			2
' recently miss @entity3 visited physical therapist @entity96 in @entity98 , @entity99 , who examined how her body reacts to the condition			1
she also performs meditation and stretching excersises to keep her episodes under control			0
now @entity106 and mr @entity12 hope to move in together and plan their future			0
the couple must also abstain from sex until she gets her condition under control - something that meditation can help with he said : ' i suppose you could say it was love at first sight with @entity3			1
dealing with her symptoms at first was kind of a challenge , because i did n't quite know how to approach it the right way			2
' as far as the sex ban goes , it was kind of hard to cope with but then i realised that it 's important to her health that she does n't do this so i 've been able to abstain as well as her			2
' i 'll continue to do whatever i can to support her			0
' miss @entity3 added : ' this past year has been amazing			1
meeting @entity12 and dr @entity57 , i finally feel like i 'm going to have a more normal life - and eventually a positive sex life			1
' dr @entity131 , an expert on sexual medicine at @entity133 in @entity134 said : ' persistent genital arousal disorder is a newly recognised condition , where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire			2
' pgad sufferers experience intrusive , unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting			0
this arousal can persist for hours , days or even longer			0
' this can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm , this often does n't help or can worsen the symptoms			0
' spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it 's those women who ca n't control the arousal which is uncommon			0
' i see around 20 women a year with this condition , it may be as common as one in 100 we just do n't know			1
' sometimes it may resolve on its own , there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient			0
