in the wake of @entity3 ' decision to temporarily step away from the @entity4 , fresh footage has emerged of him lying yet again about the 2003 iraq war story that has got him into so much hot water			1
the latest footage to surface is a 2007 interview with @entity11 in which @entity3 repeats his claim that a rocket - propelled grenade was fired at his helicopter			1
the news anchor admitted on wednesday that the story is totally false , but in the interview with a student journalist he even goes further and claims that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of the weapon			1
in a 2007 interview with @entity11 , @entity3 claims that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of an rpg that had been fired at his helicopter in @entity26 in 2003 ' i looked down the tube of an rpg that had been fired at us and had hit the chopper in front of ours			1
and i 'm so fortunate to be sitting here , ' @entity3 told his young interviewer prior to a speaking engagement at the campus			1
during the same interview @entity3 also recalls a close call in @entity38 in 2006 when he also claims he was lucky to escape rocket fire , reports @entity40			1
' i 've been very lucky to have survived a few things that i 've been involved in , ' said @entity3 in 2007			1
' the war with @entity43 in @entity38 a few years back where there were katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in			1
' yet @entity3 ' original report on the july 2006 incident tells a rather less dramatic version of events			1
it does not reference anything close to rockets passing ' just beneath ' his chopper and nor does he make any claims about being lucky to be alive			1
fresh footage has emerged of @entity3 , pictured above in 2014 , lying yet again about the 2003 iraq war story that has forced him to temporarily step away from anchoring the @entity4 ' the trails of smoke and dust visible out the window are where katyusha rockets have landed - in this case in the uninhabited @entity38 countryside , and in some cases they have set fire to the surrounding brush			1
the missiles are unguided and random			0
and plentiful , ' writes @entity3			2
' then , i noticed something out the window			0
from a distance of six miles , i witnessed a rocket launch			0
a rising trail of smoke , then a second rocket launch , an orange flash and more smoke â€” as a rocket heads off toward @entity38			2
' but , in the 2007 interview , he told the student : ' i 've been very , very lucky the way my life has turned out			1
' @entity87 president @entity86 announced on friday that an internal investigation had been launched after questions arose over @entity3 ' false on - air statements that he was in a helicopter hit by a rocket - propelled grenade while in @entity26 in 2003			1
then in a memo on saturday to @entity87 staff , that was released by the network , the anchorman said that as managing editor of @entity4 it had become ' painfully apparent ' that he has become a distracting news story			1
@entity3 announced that was taking himself off the broadcast for several days with weekend anchor @entity103 set to fill in			1
' made a mistake recalling ' : @entity3 , shown left in @entity26 and right in the aftermath of @entity106 , has found his claims met with scrutiny in the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news , it has become painfully apparent to me that i am presently too much a part of the news , due to my actions			1
' as managing editor of @entity4 , i have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days , and @entity103 has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue			2
upon my return , i will continue my career - long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us			0
a source told the @entity128 will not be involved in any of the day - to - day editing of the program during his absence			2
it has been repeatedly reported that @entity4 executives were warned a year ago about @entity3 constantly inflating his biography			1
the @entity135 reports that it had got to the point where it was a joke in the news division but ' there was no one around to pull his chain when he got too over-the - top '			0
@entity87 refused to comment saturday on when or whether @entity3 would return and who would decide his future			1
@entity3 , however , said he would be back			2
' in the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news , it has become painfully apparent to me that i am presently too much a part of the news , due to my actions , ' @entity3 said in his memo			2
' upon my return , i will continue my career - long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us , ' he wrote			0
there was no indication by @entity3 , who has anchored @entity4 since 2004 , that an absence was forthcoming during his newscast on friday			1
he signed off as he usually does , saying he hoped people would be back to see him on monday			0
@entity103 did mention @entity3 ' leave in saturday 's newscast			1
' a word tonight about our colleague @entity3 , who you may know has been under scrutiny this past week over his recollection of certain stories he 's covered , ' @entity103 said before reading @entity3 ' memo to viewers			2
since @entity3 ' apology , questions also have been raised about his claim that he saw a body or bodies in the @entity106 floodwaters that hit @entity182 in 2005			2
his remarks in a 2006 interview drew suspicion because there was relatively little flooding in @entity182 ' @entity187 , the area where @entity3 was staying			1
a person at @entity4 confirmed that @entity3 stayed at the @entity189 , which is in an area where a news photographer and a law enforcement official said they saw bodies			1
@entity4 has reigned as the top - rated evening newscast over its competition on @entity197 and @entity198			2
@entity3 ' importance to @entity87 goes beyond his anchor status , said @entity201 , a faculty member for broadcast and online at @entity204 , a journalism think tank			1
' he sets the tone of the network			0
it may not be as critical as when ( @entity211 ) @entity210 was @entity197 ' anchor , in every way , but he is more than a face , ' he said			0
@entity3 ' absence itself is a delicate challenge , according to @entity201			2
' he ca n't be gone long			0
the timing will be critical - too short and it wo n't seem like he has taken himself out of the game long enough , and too long and he looks like damaged goods , ' he said			0
