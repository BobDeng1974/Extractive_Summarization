by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 22 october 2013 an @entity2 university student has taken it upon himself to heal broken hearts - one song at a time @entity6 , a @entity7 film student , filmed by @entity8 who is studying film at @entity10 , enters packed university lecture theaters , singles out a girl and begins singing to her at the top of his lungs			1
during the serenade he hands the bewildered girl a flower before leaving the lecture grinning ear to ear and generally to rapturous applause and laughter			2
for the next video , they added an acoustic guitar accompaniment by @entity42			1
dressed like he 's going to church on sunday with a white shirt tucked into black pants and a tie , @entity6 strides into packed lectures halls and starts belting out boy - band standards			1
lecturers , cut off mid-sentence , look at the interlopers askance			0
young women seated in the first row watch with bemused looks as the singing young man approaches , flower in hand , before it dawns that the performance is aimed at them and they are generally simultaneously embarrassed , amused and confused			0
in one packed lecture theater at @entity63 , the whole front row receives yellow flowers , which could n't fail to melt even the most angst - ridden college girl 's heart			1
at the @entity70 the boys ' reputations seem to have preceded them , as the lecture hall begins tittering as soon as they hear the opening strains of acoustic guitar			1
tough crowd : some people are less enchanted with @entity6 's singing than others front row : with one notable exception , the girls in this lecture 's front row seem to have enjoyed @entity6 's efforts in one lecture , @entity6 finishes up his love - song to a university student and begins to leave the lecture theater before turning back and serenading the stern - looking lecturer with @entity89 's @entity90 which has both the lecturer and students in stitches			1
at the @entity95 , a female lecturer who is serenaded is so touched she offers both young men chocolate bars for their efforts			0
one professor who clearly believes in love from @entity70 holds his lapel microphone in front of @entity104 as he sings to amplify his dulcet tones			2
' we did n’t think the professors would be so cool about it , ' @entity6 told @entity109			2
' we thought some would [ tell us to ] get out and would tell us not to disturb the lecture			0
' and while professors and students alike seem delighted by the unexpected mid-lecture music break , some university officials are less than pleased about the interruptions			0
' we value the time of our faculty and our students , and must oppose activities that disrupt teaching and learning , however briefly , for purposes of entertainment , ' @entity118 , vice-principal academic and dean of the @entity95 told @entity109 via email			0
' we also can not endorse having our students or faculty singled out for attention , possibly quite unwelcome , in the context of a love song when they are supposed instead to be teaching or learning , ' she said			0
students do not agree with this attitude , though			0
' it definitely made my day , ' @entity136 told @entity109			0
' who does n’t want a guy singing to her ? ' hilarity : the student sitting in front of the girl @entity6 is singing to is amazed by the unexpected turn of events amplified : this lecturer lends his microphone to @entity6 @entity149 : the efforts of @entity6 , @entity25 and @entity8 result in a lot of laughter and a welcome respite from the rigors of academic work ' @ kyleforgeard you seem to have missed @entity157 on your rounds			1
i like daisies , ' tweeted a @entity162 student to @entity6			1
@entity6 and @entity8 say they serenade women to make people happy and the videos are not part of their coursework			1
according to @entity109 , the pair have been making videos together since ninth grade			0
their @entity173 channel , @entity172 , has received thousands of hits since they posted their university serenades			1
' it ’s a passion of ours , ' said @entity6			2
' we want to grow our [ @entity173 ] channel and make it big			2
