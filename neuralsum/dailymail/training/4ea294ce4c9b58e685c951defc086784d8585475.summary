an @entity1 woman who reached down into her tummy and tearfully delivered her baby during a caesarean has encouraged women to consider the procedure			1
@entity7 , 27 , gave birth to baby @entity9 in a maternal - assisted caesarean at @entity11 , @entity12 on january 15			1
the process follows the typical caesarean procedure , performed by surgeons			1
the major difference being the mother , wearing sterilised gloves , plucks the baby out herself			2
' it was a beautiful , healing moment - after two emergency caesareans , ' said mrs @entity7 , now a mother - of - three			1
she told @entity23 it made the caesarean feel ' natural '			2
the rare procedure can bring humanity to an operation some women find dehumanising , although some obstetricians and midwives are cautious			1
born , at last : @entity7 welcomes her third baby , @entity9 , into the world after lifting her out of her sectioned belly wearing gloves and guided by hospital staff , mrs @entity7 welcomed @entity36 into the world at @entity11 , @entity12 , last week ' i ca n't explain it			1
it was wonderful ' ! @entity7 meets baby @entity9 for the first time after lifting her from her belly at the end of her caesarean section the key thing for hospital teams to consider is infection , said associate professor @entity48 , the vice president of the @entity49			1
different hospital follow different protocols to ensure the mother is kept sterile			0
mrs @entity53 wore two pairs of gloves to keep the second pair completely sterile			1
ms @entity7 followed strict sterilisation procedures			2
she was scrubbed up , wearing gloves and unable to move her hands			2
' i sort of understand very well where people say " this is something that adds an element of risk " and , " does it really add anything to the procedure , ' assoc. prof @entity48 said			2
' certainly some may feel its a great joy and benefit			0
' how does it play out in terms of risk to the woman ? nobody really knows			0
i suspect it 's low but i ca n't prove that			0
' i think every other aspect ( of birth ) we 're all so paranoid about making sure it 's done as safely and minimise the risk of complications and infection			1
mr @entity48 said he would be happy to perform the procedure , although some obstetricians are more reticent to perform the procedure			0
it requires the buy - in of hospital staff , including those in the operating theatre , anaesthetists and hospital policymakers			0
midwifery expert professor @entity94 , from the @entity95 , has seen one maternal - assisted caesarean over her long career but said several hospitals were open to performing them			1
' there would be lots of obstetricians unhappy with it happening			0
it also is a little bit more work for the midwives and everyone			0
( the patient ) has to make sure her hands do n't touch anything			0
' ' not all women want this			0
it 's something that some women do , ' ' said @entity115 , who has delivered babies for more than 25 years			1
' i think it certainly should be a choice			0
' @entity7 was moved to tears after meeting baby @entity9 following her maternal assisted caesarean procedure @entity122 : @entity7 is pictured here with her elder daughter @entity124 and her newest daughter @entity9 birth of baby @entity127 : @entity53 , 41 , from @entity128 on the @entity129 is pictured lifting her 10th child from her sectioned tummy and now baby @entity132 : mrs @entity53 then lifted her 11th child out			1
she told @entity23 on thursday the twins will be her and husband @entity135 's last additions to the family and women who have experienced maternal - assisted caesareans said it was a vast improvement on their previous procedures			1
' my other caesareans were very sterile , very surgical , very impersonal , ' mrs @entity53 told @entity23 from her home on the @entity129 earlier this week			1
' people were talking about what they did on the weekend without even thinking about me laying on the table , going through this momentous experience of having a baby			2
' ' this was much more personal			0
' ms @entity7 , who had no complications and was thrilled with the process , has no regrets about her choice			2
she told @entity23 it was an option women in her shoes should consider			0
' i 'd probably say it was the closet thing i could possibly have to delivering naturally			0
' ' i 'd recommend anyone who 'd like to try a caesarean as close as a natural birth as possible to highly consider it , ' she said .			0

several @entity1 women have had the rare procedure safely
@entity7 , 27 , had a maternal assisted caesarean section last week
