by @entity0 a @entity1 @entity2 mp was branded ‘ crass , ignorant and insensitive ’ yesterday after he joked about encouraging jihadists to blow up a building that spoils his view			1
@entity6 said that if @entity8 terrorists ever came to the picturesque city of @entity10 he would ask them to destroy a newly - built @entity12 centre near his home			1
the 46 - year - old , who was elected an mep for @entity16 in may , told a local newspaper : ‘ if you had @entity1 policy on planning it would never have got through			0
‘ my view of the lovely cathedral , one of the most beautiful buildings in @entity16 , is now blocked			0
as a joke , if @entity8 came in i would be saying that ’s the first building you can get , please			1
just move it so i can have my vision back			0
’ the extreme @entity29 group @entity8 has been engaged in a series of horrific massacres across @entity32 and @entity33 since early 2013			1
@entity34 , the @entity35 ’s parliamentary candidate in @entity10 , said the comment spoke volumes about the character of @entity1			0
he added : ‘ at a time of serious terrorist activity in various parts of the world ... @entity1 inviting a terrorist organisation like @entity8 to destroy a building in our city is crass , ignorant and insensitive			2
’ mr @entity6 , a former barrister who is the party ’s @entity47 spokesman , later apologised , saying : ‘ the devastating and worrying violence in the @entity50 is something i am well aware of and which i have commented on on many occasions			1
the issues and death are no laughing matter			0
‘ the joke was to identify an ugly building in @entity10 which has altered the beautiful historical views and surrounding architectural context			2
’ the extreme @entity29 group @entity8 has been engaged in a series of horrific massacres across @entity32 and @entity33 since early 2013 mr @entity6 , 46 , said : ‘ i simply used hyperbole which is a common method in northern comedy			1
' i did n’t think for a moment this would be regarded as something i actually wished for or advocated			0
in future i shall be more circumspect and just stick to professional language			0
’ however , agreeing with him about the @entity12 building , mr @entity34 said it was a ‘ poor design which does no favours for our city			2
’ the building is described as a super-surgery which will amalgamate a number of @entity78 in the area , something which has angered residents .			2

@entity6 joked that the terror group could *prioritise* the building
he has since apologised for his ' hyperbolic ' comments
