@entity0 and @entity1 could be beneficiaries of the uncertainty around an @entity5 squad whose reputation has been left in tatters by the @entity8			1
question marks remain over the fitness of @entity11 and @entity12 ahead of wednesday ’s naming of the party for a three - @entity5 series against the @entity16 that @entity17 desperately needs to win if he is to remain @entity5 coach			1
@entity11 and @entity12 were injured towards the end of @entity5 ’s disastrous @entity8 campaign and are far from certain of being fit ahead of the first test in @entity22 on april 13 that follows two warm - up games in @entity25			2
@entity0 could be named as part of the @entity5 squad ahead of the three - @entity5 series against @entity16 the 23 - year - old is an all - rounder who bowls left - arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for @entity31 the 23 - year - old @entity0 is an all - rounder who bowls left - arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for @entity31			1
is he any good ? just ask @entity33 ! so often a victim of left - arm spin , the former @entity5 batsman was dismissed by a 19 - year - old @entity0 as @entity37 beat @entity31 by 10 wickets in 2011			1
@entity0 has 54 first - class wickets and a batting average of 30.16			0
@entity41 ? @entity0 would probably be among the smarter cricketers in @entity5 ’s tour party , having studied politics at @entity45			2
he admits he is often ribbed by his team - mates for having a crossword out in the dressing room			0
that means @entity31 ’s left - arm spin - bowling all - rounder @entity0 and @entity51 pace bowler @entity1 could be named to travel with the squad as cover for @entity11 and @entity56 in the early days of the month - long tour			1
@entity0 , 23 , is predominantly a batsman and topped 1,000 championship runs last season but is perhaps the nearest equivalent to @entity11 on the circuit			0
@entity1 impressed @entity5 ’s outgoing fast bowling coach @entity62 during a training camp in @entity64 before @entity65 and only fitness concerns have held the 25 - year - old back from full international recognition			2
it seems certain that @entity70 , now returned to full fitness after leaving @entity5 ’s last @entity73 tour with a condition later diagnosed as situational anxiety , will return after a successful tour of @entity64 as @entity78 captain			0
@entity5 ’s test middle order is settled following the success of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 in the three successive victories over @entity85 last summer , leaving @entity70 to battle @entity86 to become @entity88 ’s opening partner			0
@entity1 ( centre ) could also be included in @entity5 's test squad to face the @entity16 question marks remain over the fitness of @entity11 ( pictured ) ahead of the @entity5 series @entity17 desperately needs @entity5 to defeat the @entity16 if he is to remain coach @entity88 , sacked as one - day captain on the brink of the @entity8 , returns to action for @entity98 against @entity99 in @entity100 starting on sunday and will then seek to build on the progress made by @entity5 in test cricket last summer			1
@entity103 , one of the casualties of the fall - out from the last @entity73 , is favourite to tour as reserve wicketkeeper ahead of @entity108 ’s exciting @entity107 , while @entity109 and @entity110 will compete for the other spin place			0
@entity109 , a more mature performer than when he was thrust into the @entity5 squad prematurely in 2009 , looked a certainty to tour until he bowled poorly for the @entity78 in @entity64 and may now be pipped by the more reliable @entity110			0
such is the desperate state of @entity116 cricket after the @entity8 that the pressure will be on not just @entity17 but also managing director @entity118 when @entity5 take on a @entity16 side who look sure to be weakened by the @entity121			2
@entity122 , for one , is likely to retire from international cricket after the @entity8 and @entity16 should be even more vulnerable than @entity5			0
@entity88 ( @entity124 , capt ) , @entity86 ( @entity125 ) , @entity126 ( @entity99 ) , @entity83 ( @entity127 ) , @entity82 ( @entity99 ) , @entity11 ( @entity128 ) or @entity0 ( @entity31 ) , @entity136 ( @entity135 ) , @entity56 ( @entity127 ) or @entity1 ( @entity51 ) , @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , @entity131 ( @entity132 ) , @entity134 ( @entity135 ) , @entity70 ( @entity127 ) , @entity103 ( @entity99 ) , @entity133 ( @entity99 ) , @entity109 ( @entity99 ) or @entity110 ( @entity108 ) .			1

@entity31 all - rounder @entity0 could be set for an @entity5 call - up
@entity51 fast bowler @entity1 could also be included
@entity17 under pressure following poor @entity8
