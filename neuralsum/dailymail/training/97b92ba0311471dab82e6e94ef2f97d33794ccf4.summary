by @entity0 last updated at 8:11 pm on 11th july 2011 the controversial @entity2 lawyer slammed for brashly celebrating her court victory with champagne and a finger up to the public has spoken out in defence of his client , insisting she never killed her two - year - old daughter @entity2			1
@entity10 , who has used his moment in the limelight following @entity14 's dramatic six - week trial to slam those who have dared to criticise the verdict , said he has not ' for one minute ' doubted the integrity of his client			1
he also took the opportunity to attack the ' stalker ' at whom he infamously stuck up his middle finger , saying the man was ' lucky ' he was protected at that moment by the walls of the bar he was outside			1
the jury at court in @entity40 found her not guilty of first degree murder , aggravated murder and aggravated child abuse			0
she was found guilty of four lesser charges of lying to police but she will walk free from from jail on june 16 because of time already served and good behaviour			0
in the wake of furious public backlash to the case 's outcome , with repeated death threats sent to @entity14 , her parents and her defence team , @entity10 took the opportunity to speak up for the reviled former murder suspect			1
@entity59 : @entity10 shares a glance with @entity2 during the dramatic six - week trial asked if he believed @entity14 was innocent , @entity10 told @entity62 : ' i do believe her story			1
i believed it from the first time i met her			0
several weeks before i formerly was on the team i went to her home , her room where all the photographs are and talked to her			1
' i have never for one minute had any doubt at all			1
she did not kill her child			0
' he added that while @entity14 has a history of lying , he believes her story on @entity2 's supposed accidental death was true			1
' i do n't think her story has changed since the very beginning , ' he insisted			2
' there 's no question that she told a lot of stories to friends for protective mechanism and i think we presented evidence for that			2
' uncouth : @entity10 flicks the bird at a ' stalker ' , left , while toasting his team 's sensational court victory @entity102 's parents @entity100 and @entity103 , who have been married for 30 years , publicly supported their daughter from her initial arrest in 2008 to the start of the murder trial			1
but on the opening day in court , the defence dropped a bombshell that @entity2 was never missing but had drowned in an accident in the family 's pool on june 16			2
more shocking was the accusation that @entity14 had sexually abused his daughter when she was a child , and suggested the dysfunctional relationship explained @entity14 's behaviour after @entity2 's death			2
tragic : two - year - old @entity2 died but no one has been convicted of murder defence lawyer @entity122 suggested this was why @entity102 had lied so frequently at first - to protect her dysfunctional family			1
he said mr @entity14 had a role in disposing the body and bullied his daughter , who he had molested from aged eight , into keeping it all secret			0
the family have denied the defence 's account of events that @entity2 drowned in their pool			2
in court , @entity2 dismissed claims that she had left a ladder to the pool in place and @entity14 denied that he had ever sexually abused his daughter			0
@entity10 insisted that @entity102 has , in fact , coped remarkably well under huge stress			1
' she 's under a lot of pressure , ' he told @entity62			1
' just imagine 23 hours a day for three years [ in a solitary cell ]			0
most people would be drooling			2
' she 's a very intelligent person			2
' we tried to keep her emotions down which is pretty hard to do when your family is testifying against you and people are calling for your blood like a lynch mob			0
' the attorney added that he was afraid for her safety in the wake of the trial			0
asked where she would go after her release next weekend , he said : ' i do n't know and if i did i would n't tell you			2
' he added : ' we 're all concerned about her safety and her future			0
i do n't know that anything is ever beyond repair			2
[ but ] i think with her parents that 's pretty well burned			0
appearance : @entity10 made the comments in defence of @entity2 ' it 's as much her country as anybody else 's			1
she just needs some time and counselling and to be reintroduced into society			0
' @entity10 came under fire last week for celebrating the court victory with a champagne party at a local bar			1
in an apparent moment of madness , he turned to one camera pointed at him and rudely flipped his middle finger			0
instead of defending the action , however , @entity10 said he was gesturing towards a ' stalker ' who he threatened was lucky he did not come out to confront him properly			1
torn apart : @entity2 , left , has become estranged from mum @entity103 after allegations of rape and incest behind bars : @entity2 will walk free from @entity40 jail on sunday 17 july ' my frustrations were not with the news media itself or in general , ' he explained			0
' there was one particular stalker that had been stalking our defence team morning noon and night every day of the trial , yelling obsenities and threatening and trying to embarrass and expose mr @entity122 , myself and the others on the team			0
' [ @entity215 ] went so far as to even ask some of the women on our team on the street if they were on their periods			0
' that little non-human person deserved what he got and he 's fortunate he was n't in the room , ' he added			1

@entity10 says he ' never for one minute ' doubted @entity102 's innocence
*praises* @entity102 for ' intelligence ' and ' *strength* ' saying others under pressure she faced would be ' drooling '
insists she has right to freedom , saying the @entity240 is ' as much her country as anyone else 's '
threatens ' stalker ' he gave finger to , saying ' he 's lucky he was n't in the room '
