by @entity0 @entity1 are in danger of ruining the narrative of their own @entity4			1
this has been a joyful three - and - a - half weeks in @entity7 and @entity1 ’s place in their own final would not do a romantic plot - line any harm			1
nevertheless , the host nation ’s reaction to the loss of their best player last friday has begun to take a little of the shine from their presence in the last four			0
we can understand @entity24 sadness at the injury to @entity26			1
the impish forward is the star player in a flawed team and , for a while , looked the best chance @entity1 had of lifting the trophy in @entity32 on sunday			1
@entity1 ’s reaction to his injury — caused in the challenge with @entity40 ’s @entity39 — has not reflected well on them			1
it was a poor tackle , certainly			0
@entity39 will not take any great pride in it			0
it was , however , @entity56 ’s team that set the tone on that brutish night in @entity58			0
it was the players in yellow who sought to reduce the contest to a test of physicality as much as football , their coach who clearly did not fancy taking on @entity40 purely at what @entity1 themselves once classified the @entity69			1
the bottom line is that if you go out looking for fights , there is always a chance you may not win and , even if you do , you are always likely to sustain collateral damage			0
devastating : @entity26 was carried off on a stretcher and his @entity4 dream was ended @entity39 was not the villain that night			1
@entity56 was the coach who devised the tactics , @entity80 his henchman and @entity83 referee @entity82 the man without the common sense or courage to do anything about it			0
@entity1 , though , have thrashed about wildly since they realised the extent of the fall - out			2
somehow they persuaded @entity92 to look retrospectively at @entity39 ’s challenge on @entity26 , unsurprisingly the disciplinary committee yesterday decided to take no action against the @entity96			2
their appeal against the booking that rules @entity100 out of today ’s semi-final against @entity102 was also unsuccessful			2
escape : @entity39 will not face any punishment for his challenge on @entity26 tearful : @entity26 sent an emotional message to the @entity24 public after his injury all this against a background of sentimentality and noise about their fallen child			1
@entity56 told us that , after the injury , @entity26 could not feel his legs			2
then on sunday the @entity1 team doctor revealed that impact 2.5cm further along @entity26 ’s spine could have left the @entity123 player with permanent damage			1
we should all be glad the 22 - year - old escaped that , of course , but this is a rather transparent brand of propaganda from @entity1 and , in all honesty , it is better left untouched			0
@entity26 , after all , is due to be playing again by the time the @entity131 season starts in @entity83			0
wave : @entity26 boards a helicopter after leaving @entity1 's @entity4 camp to return home meanwhile : @entity56 's side train ahead of their semi-final showdown with @entity102 @entity139 and his cohorts are trying to place undue pressure on today ’s referee @entity142 or make @entity144 ’s @entity143 think twice about making their tackles we can only speculate			1
if that is the plan , we can only imagine that @entity148 and @entity149 are not worrying too much about it			0
if @entity1 are to reach the final and pay back their public on a tournament that has cost millions then they will not bully their way to @entity32			2
that was a one - trick hand and it has been played .			0

@entity26 's injury suffered in @entity1 's win against @entity40 has ruled him out of the @entity4
hosts now face @entity102 and a potential @entity4 final without their star man
