former @entity1 chairman @entity0 has urged @entity3 nations to boycott the 2018 @entity4 unless world governing body @entity5 undergoes serious reform			1
@entity5 is firmly under the spotlight again following the release of a report on thursday by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of their ethics committee which cleared @entity14 and @entity15 to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments , having found no serious breaches of bidding rules by either nation			1
@entity20 , who conducted the investigation on which thursday 's report was based but whose full report has not been made public , has appealed against the version released by @entity5			1
@entity26 chairman @entity0 has called on @entity3 nations including @entity28 to skip the 2018 @entity4 @entity0 ( pictured ) believes boycotting the tournament could help force @entity5 into much - needed reform allegations of corruption - strenuously denied - continue to be levelled against the @entity15 and @entity14 2018 bid teams			1
according to @entity0 , who retired from his post with the @entity1 last year , boycotting football 's biggest tournament should be a real possibility but only if other countries support @entity28 in doing so			1
' @entity28 on its own can not influence this - one country ca n't do it , ' he told @entity42			2
' if we tried to do something like that we 'd be laughed at			0
i think @entity28 within @entity46 undoubtedly have the power to influence @entity5 , but to do so they would have to consider withdrawing from the @entity4 , the next @entity4 , unless proper reform - including ( @entity5 president @entity50 ) @entity49 not standing ( for a fifth term ) - is carried out at @entity5			1
@entity0 wants @entity3 nations such as @entity4 holders @entity54 to stand up against @entity5 @entity20 has appealed against the version of his report into the bidding process released by @entity5 ' if i was at the @entity1 now , i would do everything i could to encourage other nations within @entity46 - and there are some who would definitely be on side , others maybe not - to take this line			1
at some stage you have to walk the talk , stop talking and do something			0
' it sounds drastic but frankly this has gone on for years now , it 's not improving , it 's going from bad to worse to worse			0
there are 54 countries within @entity46			0
there 's @entity54 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 - all powerful			0
you ca n't hold a serious @entity4 without them			2
they have the power to influence if they have the will			0
' @entity0 , who gave way to @entity84 as the head of the @entity1 , says the events surrounding the report into 2018 and 2022 bidding went ' beyond ridicule ' and said he had stepped down from his role on @entity5 's anti-discrimination task force as a consequence			1
@entity5 president @entity49 has been criticised after @entity14 and @entity15 were awarded the next two @entity94 @entity28 captain @entity95 ( right ) celebrates scoring a penalty in his country 's 3 - 1 win against @entity99 he added : ' @entity5 is sort of a totalitarian set - up			1
bits of it remind me of the old @entity105 empire			2
people do n't speak out and if they do they get quashed			0
' the choosing of @entity15 was clearly one of the most ludicrous decisions in the history of sport			2
you might as well have chosen @entity113 in the winter			0
it was like an @entity117 sort of decision			0
' i 've resigned for two reasons - firstly , the body has been pretty ineffectual			0
i 've been on it for more than a year and we only had one meeting ; secondly because frankly i do n't wish to be personally associated with @entity5 any further			2

@entity14 and @entity15 have been cleared to hold the 2018 and 2022 @entity94
@entity20 investigated the bidding process and has appealed against the version of his report released by @entity5 last week
former @entity1 chairman @entity0 wants @entity3 nations to boycott the 2018 tournament in @entity14
@entity0 believes @entity28 could not influence @entity5 on their own
' bits of @entity5 remind me of the old @entity105 empire , ' he added
