a @entity1 mom who claims her son was ' kidnapped ' by social workers in a hospital on the grounds of medical child abuse is desperately fighting to regain custody			1
@entity8 says her son @entity9 - now 16 - has had health issues since he was child , beginning with breaking his leg at age six and the bones never fully recovering			1
at 15 his leg was partially amputated to fit a prosthetic , however there were complications , with the teen suffering tremors and intense pain after the surgery			1
after being transferred to numerous children 's hospitals around the country , an mri determined @entity9 had tumors on his leg and he was diagnosed with neurofibromitoisis			1
fighting for her son : @entity8 says her sickly son , @entity9 , was wrongly taken away from her amid allegations of medical child abuse @entity9 under surgery at @entity32 in @entity33 on march 31 , but the tremors and pain persisted			1
doctors suggested @entity9 manage without drugs			1
' they could n't help him , and i , as his parent , requested , ‘ please , get him help somewhere , ' @entity8 told @entity38			1
' i wanted him transferred , ' @entity8 said rider said she called an ethics meeting with her son ’s doctors and social workers , asking that he be transferred to another hospital			1
then on april 15 , upon arriving at the hospital , @entity8 was met in the lobby by a social worker , who took her to a room with two doctors and another social worker , none of whom @entity8 had met before			1
the mom was then told @entity9 had been taken into emergency custody due to evidence of medical abuse			1
doctors believed that @entity9 was coping better and improving when his mother was not around and that ' only pharmacological means can be used to treat pain ' , according to the @entity64			1
' all attempts to … have [ the ] mother voluntarily partner with us in [ the boy 's ] care have been futile and met with resistance , ' the doctor 's reported			0
' in order to best develop a therapeutic medical plan for [ the boy ] , we need to remove the mother from his care at the moment			0
' poorly : @entity80 has been in and out of hospital since the age of six , stemming from a broken leg that never properly healed stunned : both mother and son said they did not understand what was happening when @entity9 was put into a foster home in @entity89 @entity9 was placed with a foster family in @entity89 and @entity8 said she was left in complete shock			1
' they literally did a hospital kidnapping , ' she said			2
@entity9 has said he feels the same way as his mother and disagrees with what the doctors are saying			1
' they kept telling me that ...			0
my anxiety is my mom causing me pain			0
' there were times [ though ] where i 'd be in pain for hours at a time and they would n't give me anything			2
' i needed , like , a muscle relaxer and they would n't give me anything for it			2
told me to wait it through			0
' that 's immoral to me , when patient in pain needs medicine , give him some pain medicine			0
' i was hurting so much at one point my nose bled			0
' if i was a doctor , i 'd be ashamed if i heard of other doctors doing stuff like this			2
they 've been lying in the court			0
' patient : @entity80 and his mom @entity8 have traveled to hospitals all over the country trying to find him the proper care at the next custody hearing on august 11 , @entity131 and her attorney , @entity132 , plan to challenge the case using an old federal law , which they believe has been violated			1
the @entity137 was passed in 1978 ' protect the best interests of @entity140 children and to promote the stability and security of @entity140 tribes and families '			0
the law puts a greater emphasis on the proof to take temporary custody of @entity140 children			2
@entity132 believes in this case there is no medical evidence that @entity131 had personally - physically or otherwise - wronged her son in any way			0
he also said that @entity9 fits the legal definition of an @entity140 child			1
@entity132 said he understands that people will think that there is more to this story , but maintains there is n't			0
' the system is something that needs to be radically confronted and resisted and changed and abolished , ' he told @entity38			0
homesick : @entity9 said he longs to return home to his and family and friends in @entity1 ' it ’s very , very similarly minded people , a class of people who believe that they understand what ’s better for other people ’s children			2
' they would n’t come out and say that , but that ’s what they do			0
' they make their living from acting that way			0
' @entity1 state rep. @entity180 told @entity38 he was stunned when he heard of @entity9 ’s situation ' these parents are hurting			2
what happened to them just should not happen to anyone else , ' @entity180 said			0
' who can possibly believe that child is better off in a foster home in @entity33 than in the family home ? ' that 's another one of those bizarre things that you just have to think , ‘ ' really ? ''			0

@entity8 lost custody of her son @entity9 , 16 , on april 15
he has been in and out of hospital from the age of six after breaking his leg
doctors and social workers claim she *insists* on giving him drugs and that his health wo n't improve while she is around
