@entity0 attempts to distance themselves from deep @entity2 cuts descended into farce today when two thirds of @entity6 's @entity5 stayed away from the @entity8 debate on their rival @entity9			1
in an unprecedented move , @entity0 treasury minister @entity10 used a statement from the government @entity13 to spell out how he disagreed with conservative plans for spending cuts			1
but despite the extraordinary stunt - which signals the death of the coalition - being central to @entity0 hopes of survival at the next election , only 17 mps , including mr @entity10 , bothered to turned up			1
behind mr @entity31 , an mp waves an ironic goodbye mr @entity10 later posed with a specially - made yellow budget box to promote his rival fiscal plan @entity10 set out the alternative @entity40 , which includes : before mr @entity10 's statement even got underway , commons speaker @entity41 cast doubt on the exercise , insisting statements ' have to be ministerial , delivered not in a personal or party capacity but on behalf of the government '			1
the @entity0 minister carried on regardless , with just a handful of backbenchers looking on			2
on the government frontbench , only deputy pm @entity6 , @entity0 chief whip @entity26 , business secretary @entity27 and deputy commons leader @entity28 had turned up			1
after a slow start , a few more @entity0 eventually filed in , taking the total to 17 , less than a third of the 56 the party currently boasts			2
asked why so few colleagues had found the time to support mr @entity10 , a party insider said organising @entity5 was like ' herding cats '			1
mr @entity6 himself got up and walked out while mr @entity10 was under attack from his @entity32 opponents			1
to much mockery from @entity32 , mr @entity10 ploughed on , claiming he was setting out @entity0 plans for those ' left cold ' by @entity68			1
@entity32 's shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity31 blasted : do n't you realise how two - faced you look ? you [ the @entity0 ] want to have your cake and eat it , to be in government but not in @entity72			1
' it 's too late for this			0
the @entity0 have backed the @entity2 all the way , working families have paid the price and now it is time for you to pay the ultimate price for your behaviour			2
' despite confirming that the @entity81 was agreed by the @entity2 and the @entity0 , mr @entity10 criticised the plans contained in it to cut government spending to 1964 levels - ' the era of @entity86 '			1
as he tried to set out his @entity0 plan that ' borrows less than @entity32 ' and ' cuts less than the @entity90 ' , he was met with a volley of heckling from @entity32 backbenchers			1
shouts of ' this is an abuse of office ' and ' this is ridiculous ' could be heard as @entity97 and others waved the coalition @entity81 document			0
in a further sign of chaos , @entity32 frontbencher @entity101 reached across the table separating the despatch boxes with a copy of the red book and dropped it in front of mr @entity10			2
just 17 @entity110 were in the @entity8 to hear mr @entity10 's statement , with 40 choosing to stay awa @entity113 , mr @entity10 detailed the @entity0 ' ' better economic plan for @entity115 '			1
he said : ' yesterday the chancellor set out the final coalition budget of this parliament			0
' the policy measures contained in the @entity81 document were all agreed between us			0
' i secured key @entity0 commitments , including a significant increase in the income tax personal allowance , support for mental health , tax measures to support motorists , scotch whisky and the oil and gas sector because together they make our society fairer and our economy stronger			2
' yet i know that millions of people watching yesterday 's exchanges between the chancellor and the opposition leader were left wondering ' is n't there another way to do this ? '			0
' because , of course , people want a stronger economy based on a credible plan			0
but people also want a fairer society based on modern public services			0
' mr @entity10 was repeatedly heckled and mocked by @entity32 over his attempts to distance himself from the @entity2 who he has shared power with for five years mr @entity10 said @entity2 spending plans would take government consumption back to the levels seen in 1964 , adding : ' the era of @entity156 is not my vision for the future of @entity115 ' @entity32 frontbencher @entity101 reached across the table separating the despatch boxes with a copy of the red book and dropped it in front of mr @entity10 mr @entity10 went on : ' so to all those people left cold by yesterday 's exchanges , to all those asking themselves is there another way , today i say yes there is , there is a better way			1
' today i set out a better economic plan for @entity115 - a plan that is based on values of fairness as well as strength , a plan that delivers on our commitment to balance the books in a fair way			2
' a plan that borrows less than @entity32 , cuts less than the conservatives and enables our country to see light at the end of the tunnel , not a rollercoaster ride but a steady path back to prosperity			2
' this sticks to the path that we have chosen in this government , not lurching away from it by cutting too much or borrowing too much			0
' the fiscal forecast published by the chancellor yesterday would , according to the @entity197 , return government consumption , the effective spending power of the state , back to the level last seen in 1964			0
' but the era of @entity156 is not my vision for the future of @entity115			0
' @entity32 's shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity31 blasted : ' do n't you realise how two - faced you look ? mr @entity41 had said he would be put in a difficult position if mr @entity10 used ' the privilege accorded to ministers for purely party purposes ' but he took a back seat for much of the speech			1
before the statement , mr @entity41 said : ' the content of ministerial statements is by a longstanding practice not a matter for the chair , nor is my permission required for such a statement to be made			0
' but these statements have to be ministerial , delivered not in a personal or a party capacity but on behalf of the government			0
' while some latitude is , of course , permitted , there does come a point at which using the privilege accorded to ministers for purely party purposes would be unfair to the @entity232 and put the chair in a very difficult position			0
i know that mr @entity10 will bear that in mind			0

@entity10 delivers unprecedented *political* @entity8 statement
set out rival spending plans to attack @entity2 for cutting to 1960s levels
@entity243 do not want to got back to the era of ' @entity86 '
but two - thirds of @entity0 mps stayed away and @entity6 left early
@entity0 insider says organising their mps is like ' herding cats '
@entity32 brands @entity10 ' two - faced ' for distancing himself from @entity2
