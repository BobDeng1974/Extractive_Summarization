two of @entity3 's top teenage sailors crashed into each other during a late - night journey , leaving a schoolgirl who was travelling with them brain - damaged , a court heard today			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , who have both represented @entity3 , were in charge of a group of 24 girls aged between 10 and 14 when they themselves were aged 17			1
their two boats collided in darkness when they were returning to their hostel after a day 's sailing on @entity19 during a half - term residential course			1
four young passengers were thrown from the boats , and one suffered severe brain injuries , @entity21 was told			2
trial : @entity8 , left , and @entity7 , right , are accused of acting recklessly before a boat collision crash : this is one of the boats involved in the collision during a half - term sailing trip in october 2010 the jury heard that the girls had been urging @entity35 to go faster moments before the two inflatable speedboats crashed			1
prosecutor @entity38 said that four boats had illegally set off across the bay without using lights			2
' two of the four boats were more powerful than the others and the defendants ran to the top of the slipway in order to get them , ' he said			0
' @entity48 was the chief instructor of the sailing course and he told the girls to be sensible			0
in fact , he said : " do n't f * * * around			0
" ' danger : the other boat involved in the crash , which took place when the boats did not have lights attached experienced : @entity8 and @entity35 were aged just 17 at the time of the accident , but were among the top young sailors in the country in previous days , the boats had been used for ' wake jumping ' , the court heard			1
mr @entity38 said : ' this is where each boat jumps the other 's wake for a thrill ride			0
it is also quite a potentially dangerous thing to do			0
' in the boat driven by @entity35 , there was effectively a request made by one or two people in the boat that they go faster , jump waves and swerve			2
' there came a point where @entity35 came across the path of @entity8 and they collided			1
' it was a sufficiently violent collision to throw two people into the water and to cause a third person to fall halfway into the water			0
a fourth young girl was thrown from one boat and landed in the other			0
' in the most severe case , a young girl suffered a brain injury of moderate severity			1
' the victim , an 11 - year - old girl , has not been named			0
court : @entity8 and @entity35 pictured with friends and family outside @entity21 today holiday : the pair were supervising a group of schoolgirls doing a residential course at @entity19 , pictured instructor @entity48 and @entity108 , organisers of the course in october 2010 , have already admitted offences in connection with the accident			1
the court heard that @entity35 and @entity8 were not qualified to drive the high - powered boats at night			1
mr @entity38 told the jury : ' these girls were in a difficult position			0
they were 17 and had been coached in sailing to some considerable success by @entity48			0
' it was his idea to cross @entity19 without lights at night and they did what he said			2
but did this collision just happen because of @entity48 and the sailing club 's bad plan - or because there was excess speed and a failure to keep a proper look out ? ' if you know you are close to other boats and without lights then you should be driving very carefully			2
it 's common sense and it 's good seamanship			0
' @entity8 and @entity35 , both 20 , admit piloting the boats without navigation lights , but deny failing to travel at a safe speed and failing to keep a proper lookout			1
