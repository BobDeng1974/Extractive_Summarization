@entity0 will acquire the maker of the popular game @entity2 for $ 2.5 billion			1
the technology company said it will buy @entity5 - based game maker @entity4			0
@entity2 , which lets users build in and explore a virtual world , has been downloaded 100 million times on pc alone since its launch in 2009			1
it is the most popular online game on @entity12 , and the top paid app for @entity16 's @entity15 and @entity19 's @entity18 operating system in the @entity20 move for mobile ? @entity0 will acquire the maker of the popular game @entity2 for $ 2.5 billion in a move many insiders say is engineered to increase the tech giant 's share in the mobile market the deal is expected to close in late 2014			1
@entity0 expects the acquisition to be break - even in fiscal 2015			0
@entity0 is primarily known for business software like @entity30			0
but this acquisition will help @entity0 expand its gaming division which also includes game franchises such as the ' @entity34 ' shooter game and ' @entity36 ' racing game			2
however , many contend that @entity0 's impending purchase of @entity4 , is more aimed at pulling users onto the software company 's obscure mobile platform than its better known pc system or @entity12 game console			1
the software company 's @entity45 system has only 2.5 percent of the world 's smartphone market , and its surface tablet barely more , according to tech research firm @entity50			2
growth is hampered because many app and game developers ignore it			0
enter @entity2 , which is the top paid app both on @entity16 's ( @entity55 ) @entity15 and @entity19 's ( @entity56 ) @entity18 systems			1
' it seems like @entity0 is looking at @entity4 and @entity2 as a way to tap into this enormous cultural phenomenon , ' said @entity61 , chief executive of independent game studio @entity63 ' if you look at @entity15 , @entity2 has been a top - grossing game for quite some time , if @entity0 could on @entity66 phones give players a unique and compelling experience that you ca n't get on the other platforms , that could be a driver to sell devices to existing @entity2 fans			1
' @entity0 does not disclose numbers of users of @entity45 , and declined comment on the deal			2
@entity2 was launched five years ago as a pc game , but 54 million sales later , about 40 percent of copies are downloaded onto phones and tablets			1
left to their own devices , it does not seem likely that @entity4 's 40 - strong team would ever get round to designing a @entity45 version of @entity2			2
@entity86 , the game 's creator and co-founder of @entity4 , said last year that @entity66 phones are so insignificant in terms of market share that they are not worth developing for			0
wildly popular : @entity2 , which lets users build in and explore a virtual world , has been downloaded 100 million times on pc alone since its launch in 2009 ' because it 's tiny , ' @entity86 wrote in an email to @entity98 last june , when asked why his company only made mobile versions of its games for @entity15 and @entity18 , but not @entity45			1
' both @entity102 and @entity103 have more users than @entity45 , ' wrote @entity86 , referring to @entity106 's discontinued operating system and the fading @entity108 smartphone pioneer			1
@entity109 is focused on the mobile benefits for @entity0			0
' we do n't view this acquisition as a signal of @entity0 's intent to double down on @entity12 but consider it an attempt to better address mobile on a cross-platform basis , ' said @entity119 analyst @entity118 in a note to clients this week			1
' this also appears to be consistent with ( @entity0 ) ceo @entity125 's mobile and cloud strategy			2
' @entity0 is expected to pay close to $ 2.5 billion for @entity4 , or about 8 times sales last year			0
that is small change for @entity0 , which has $ 86 billion in cash and short - term investments			0
but it is relatively large and expensive for game company acquisitions , which do not have a stellar record of success			0
@entity136 's @entity135 ( @entity137 ) paid $ 1.53 billion for a 50 percent stake in @entity140 game maker @entity139 last year at about 3.5 times projected annual sales			2
@entity145 ' ( @entity144 ) $ 750 million acquisition of @entity146 in 2011 was valued around 10 to 11 times sales			0
@entity148 , chief executive of research firm @entity149 , said the price tag ' seems like a lot for a title that has certainly not peaked but is certainly not in its initial frenzy			0
' he doubts that @entity2 can really help @entity66 phone sales : ' @entity2 itself has done very well on the @entity15 platform , but it 's better on the @entity159 , the screen is bigger , ' he said			1
' i do n't see why this could drive handset sales			0
