' @entity17 ' : fusilier @entity9 ' wife @entity8 sold his @entity10 over the internet for £ 500 ' insulting ' : fusilier @entity9 ' morther @entity20 said she would have re-mortgaged her house to get her son 's medal back but @entity26 ’s devastated parents have criticised their daughter - in - law for not offering it to them before selling it			1
@entity30 and @entity31 have now paid the new owner £ 1,757 – more than three times the initial listing – to retrieve the medal			1

mrs @entity26 , 49 , last night branded her daughter - in - law as ‘ callous ’ and ‘ despicable ’			2
she said : ‘ it ’s as if my boy ’s life meant nothing to her			0
‘ it was terribly insulting that she did n’t offer us the medal instead of sneakily selling it			0
’ @entity26 , from @entity49 , was serving with the @entity50 in the feared @entity51			1
he and his wife had been married for just a few months when he was killed on his six - month tour of duty			1

’ sacrifice : the @entity10 was presented to fusilier @entity87 after he was killed in an explosion in @entity51 in 2009 ( file picture ) but four years after @entity26 ’s premature death , his young widow – who had fallen out with the soldier ’s family and is now in a new relationship – advertised the @entity10 on the internet			1
it was snapped up by a dealer in @entity98 , who paid £ 1,200 – £ 700 above the initial asking price – and then placed it with the @entity101 , a shop that specialises in selling military memorabilia			2
the @entity101 insists it did not make a profit on the transaction			0
@entity106 and mrs @entity26 have said they would have re-mortgaged their house in order to retrieve the award			0
