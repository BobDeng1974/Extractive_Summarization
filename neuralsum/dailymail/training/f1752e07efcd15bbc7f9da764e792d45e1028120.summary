a teenager who suffers from a rare genetic condition which makes her look middle - aged has been given new confidence thanks to pioneering facelift surgery			1
@entity4 , 16 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , had to endure years of cruel taunts and even physical abuse because of her appearance			1
she inherited lipodystrophy - which makes her skin looked wrinkled and twisted - from her mother @entity12 who also suffers from the illness			1
but after hearing of her condition , a top surgeon in the @entity15 offered to perform cosmetic surgery for free			1
it has proved to be a complete success and @entity4 has felt able to start a relationship with new boyfriend @entity21 and is even keen to go to college			1
by the time she was 12 , @entity4 was already being mistaken for a middle - aged woman - and was even mistaken for 17 - year - old sister @entity41 's mother			1
but now thanks to a lifeline by a surgeon in the @entity15 @entity4 feels indistinguishable from her peers			1
dr @entity45 told @entity4 her condition is actually cutis laxa , an even rarer disease which only affects 30 people in the @entity50			1
and @entity4 , who one day dreams of owning a beauty salon , says she is ready to leave the past behind and forgive her tormentors			1
she said : ' before i had surgery i was picked on for looking different , now i look the same as other girls my age			2
' i do n't feel like people are staring at me when i walk down the street anymore			0
i finally feel like a teenager			0
' i 've carried some hurtful comments with me all my life but now i feel ready to leave the past behind and forgive and forget			0
' her newfound self - assurance has helped her start a relationship with apprentice painter and decorator @entity70 , 22 , three months ago , who she met through friends			1
she said : ' i 've had boyfriends in the the past but i do n't think any accepted my condition , really			0
but with @entity75 it 's never been an issue			0
found love : on top of her facelift , @entity4 has also met a new boyfriend @entity21 ' he 's seen pictures of me before and told me i was always beautiful - although i would n't have had the self - confidence to believe him before			1
' growing up @entity4 put her rapid aging down to lipodystrophy - a genetic illness which decays bones and destroys fat beneath the skin			1
at age four doctors told her she had inherited the condition from @entity12 after she developed excess skin round her jawline			2
@entity4 said : ' @entity93 explained that i had an illness like she did , but that i was beautiful and should n't pay any attention to what anyone said			2
' the bullying was worst between the ages of eight and ten			2
kids used to call me monkey and granny and i was even beaten up just because of how i looked			1
' it got so bad i stopped going for a while			0
' but even after changing schools @entity4 's life was made a misery because of her illness			1
she recalled : ' i lived in fear of being asked how old i was			0
genetic : @entity4 , pictured right pre-surgery , inherited the condition from her mother @entity12 , left			2
but sister @entity41 , centre , has not been affected ' i was even mistaken for a teacher in school on a couple of occasions , which was just mortifying in front of my classmates			2
' after @entity4 's plight was made public she was contacted by lipodystrophy expert dr @entity45 , from @entity126 , @entity15 , who asked to carry out some tests on @entity4 and @entity12			1
the pair were found to be suffering from cutis laxa , an even rarer condition which can shorten life expectancy , weaken joints and can lung and heart problems			0
taunts : as a child , @entity4 was bullied by other children who called her ' monkey ' and ' granny ' although hard news to take in , @entity4 was later presented with the offer of a facelift and nose augmentation free of charge by top surgeon dr @entity147			1
she said : ' it was an amazing opportunity that i could never of dreamed of before			0
' when i saw myself in the mirror after the bandages all came off it was mixture of surprise and happiness			0
' i used to hate my nose , but now i love it			0
' difficult : @entity4 said she was even confused as a teacher at school on several occasions , but feels much happier after her facelift with boyfriend @entity70 , right and thanks to her confidence boost , @entity4 is determined to go to college and achieve her ambition			1
she said : ' i feel much more confident and just happier in general			0
' i 'm now able to do things like going to college and having a career which i might not have felt possible before			2
' the surgery has given me a boost and now i do n't fear what other people think			0
' i 've noticed a change in me and i feel a lot happier			0
' and poignantly , @entity4 says she is all the more determined to live a happy , normal life because of the support she has had from her mother @entity12			2
she said : ' i know i 'm lucky to have had the opportunity and it 's something my mum would have loved to have been offered			0
' i want to make something of my life for her - to make her proud			0
' i know i 'll always have this condition and it may shorten my life , but at least i can feel more like comfortable and confident			0
' although i look younger i still feel older than my years because of everything i have been through			0
