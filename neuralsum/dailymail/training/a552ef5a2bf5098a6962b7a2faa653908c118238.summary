@entity2 with her son @entity0 aged 21 weeks			1
doctors told her she could lose both twins but @entity0 survived a mother - to - be who feared losing both her twins has told how she had to carry one in her womb for five weeks after it died to save the life of the other			1
@entity13 , 27 , suffered from twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome which caused one of her unborn babies to take in too many nutrients in the womb - starving his brother			1
doctors warned both babies could die - with bigger baby @entity21 growing too fast and tiny @entity0 being too small and weak as a result of the rare condition			1
they performed two risky operations to separate the twins , which resulted in @entity21 's death at 22 weeks			1
@entity0 immediately began gaining strength and was born by caesarean section at 27 weeks - the death of his bigger brother having saved his life			1
however , @entity2 then went through the harrowing experience of giving birth to one live and one dead baby			1
the community carer from @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ' @entity21 died to save his brother			1
' as soon as he passed away , @entity0 was able to develop and grow strong , he finally had the blood and nutrients to survive			2
' he is our little miracle			2
i will never let him forget how his big brother saved his life and is now his angel			2
' @entity2 and husband @entity48 , 26 , an aircraft mechanic in the @entity50 , were thrilled when she became pregnant in july last year			2
but she began to bleed in september and was rushed to an emergency scan at the @entity52 in @entity52 , @entity39 - which showed she was expecting identical twins			2
a second routine scan two weeks later , on september 26 , revealed the devastating news that she had twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome			2
the condition , affecting one in 1,300 twin pregnancies , is a disease of the placenta where one twin takes in too many nutrients by receiving most of the blood supply from the placenta - starving the other			2
an ultrasound of @entity13 's twins in november last year			2
the larger twin @entity21 ( on the right ) perished in the womb but @entity2 had to carry him to save @entity0 @entity0 was born by caesarean section at 27 weeks there was a fluid discrepancy between @entity2 's babies , with @entity21 taking up more nutrients than his younger brother			1
the problem became so bad that @entity2 was forced to undergo laser treatment at @entity81 in @entity82 on october 21 , when she was 18 weeks pregnant			2
@entity2 , who also has a son @entity83 , six , added : ' we were given three options			0
the first was to terminate both twins , which we said ' no ' straight away to			0
' we were then offered the laser surgery , which had a 40 per cent chance one would survive , 30 per cent chance that both would and a 30 per cent chance that both would die			0
' the third option was to leave it but there was an 85 per cent chance both would die and i would miscarry			0
we chose to take the laser option			0
' incredibly , both babies survived the first procedure , in which doctors inserted a metal rod into @entity2 's womb and used lasers to cut blood vessels between the twins			0
@entity2 with her son @entity108 when she was pregnant with the twins ( left ) and today with @entity0 ( right )			0
she said : ' @entity21 died to save his brother ' @entity2 and @entity48 with their son			1
they do n't know if @entity0 will have any healthy problems as a result of his early birth @entity2 and @entity48 , who moved from @entity117 to @entity39 four years ago , married on november 5 , with @entity2 feeling the effects of twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome			0
a scan two days after their wedding showed @entity0 had no fluid around him and was ' shrink wrapped ' in his sac , while @entity21 had lots with his heart overloading to keep up with it			1
doctors made the decision to repeat the laser procedure for a second time but had to choose one twin to give more access to the placenta			0
@entity2 began experiencing excruciating pains after the laser treatment and the next day doctors broke the devastating news that @entity21 had died			1
she said : ' words just can not describe how horrendous it was when @entity21 passed away , it was the worst day of my life			1
' the doctors said there was a chance both babies would die but nothing can prepare you for it when it happens			0
' i would wake up some mornings and just think ' i ca n't do this '			0
i had to stay strong for @entity0 but it was just so hard			1
' because i was so used to @entity21 moving and not connor i just had a massive dead weight in me			1
' @entity0 started producing fluid for the first time and a bladder appeared for the first time too but it was so hard to get excited because i was so upset about losing @entity21			1
' i do n't know how i would have got through without @entity48 and @entity83 , they were fantastic			0
' @entity2 and @entity160 moments after @entity2 gave birth on the 27th december intensive care : @entity0 moments after he was born @entity2 continued to carry both babies before giving birth to both by caesarean section at 4.30am on december 31 at @entity167			0
the twins were in separate sacs so were sterile from each other			0
she added : ' i was ten centimetres dilated and the nurse said she could feel feet of one moving baby and the hands of one that was n't moving			0
' it was horrendous carrying both of them			0
every time @entity0 moved @entity21 moved as well and i kept thinking that maybe he might be alive still			1
' @entity0 , weighing 1lb 14 oz , was rushed into intensive care while @entity21 , who weighed just 210g , was taken to meet @entity2 and @entity181			1
doctors gave @entity0 a 70 per cent chance of survival but he battled through three months of intensive care and was allowed home on oxygen on march 26 , four days before his due date			0
now five months old , he weighs 8lb 11oz			0
it is not clear whether he will suffer any long term health implications .			0
