@entity1 manager @entity0 feels his side showed they do have what it takes to get the results needed to stay in the @entity7 after coming from behind to dump @entity8 out of the @entity9 at @entity10			1
the foxes , bottom of the top - flight , produced a battling display to stun @entity8 with two late goals on saturday			1
@entity16 cancelled out a first - half penalty from @entity8 midfielder @entity18 before @entity19 stabbed a stoppage - time winner past flapping goalkeeper @entity21 to send them into the fifth - round draw			1
@entity0 watches on from the touchline at @entity10 on saturday @entity0 ( left ) and @entity8 boss @entity25 ( right ) greet each other prior the game at @entity10 @entity0 believed the result was all the more impressive given the injustice of seeing @entity30 , the Â£ 9million signing making his full debut , booked for diving when he should have been awarded a penalty after being tripped by @entity21			1
@entity1 , who are three points adrift of safety , travel to @entity36 next weekend , then host rejuvenated @entity39 before heading to @entity40			1
@entity0 is confident the manner of the victory at @entity10 can stand his squad in good stead for the challenges ahead			1
' we have found life in the @entity7 harder than we would have liked , but the players have shown an awful lot of mental resilience , ' he said			0
' we have been playing well in a lot of games and not getting the results performances have warranted @entity1 drew level through @entity16 late on before they went on to win the tie @entity19 celebrates after scoring the winning goal in added time in north @entity57 ' so from being a team which was winning every week last season ( in the @entity60 ) to not being able to find the results can be a psychological hurdle to overcome			1
' the learning curve of being able to be competitive in the top flight is about being efficient in both boxes and we have not always taken chances when they have come , and we have been punished severely for minor errors			0
' but ( with victory at @entity8 ) we have shown we are capable , so it is important we look at what is happening realistically - there is no point going overboard because we have won a cup game , but our performance has been very encouraging			0
' we showed resilience and know - how , and created chances			0
' @entity8 manager @entity25 made no less than nine changes from the side which had started the midweek @entity83 semi-final win over @entity84			2
@entity18 had given @entity8 the lead from the penalty spot against @entity1 however , the @entity88 coach insists that should not have made a difference as @entity8 were made to pay for not killing off @entity1			2
@entity8 must , though , quickly regroup as they head to @entity90 on wednesday night defending a slender 1 - 0 lead in the battle to reach @entity93			2
' it is important to keep our motivation and confidence , because we need to play on wednesday with our best performance , it will be a really tough game , ' he said			0
@entity21 , who could yet retain his place in the side next week , admits the manner of the defeat was tough to take , the @entity101 having earlier kept his side in the tie with a couple of fine saves before his untimely gaff allowed @entity19 's shot to roll over the goalline			2
' if that ( mistake ) happens earlier in the game , maybe you can turn it around , but at the end makes it even worse , ' @entity21 said on @entity118			0
' when the ball goes in , it is horrible , but that is football			0
' i am gutted now , but you have to go on because there is another big game ahead on wednesday and we have to focus on that as quickly as possible			0
