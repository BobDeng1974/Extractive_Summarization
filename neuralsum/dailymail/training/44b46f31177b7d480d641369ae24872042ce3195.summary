getting humans to @entity1 will be no easy feat - it will take upwards of nine months to get there , and a complex spacecraft will be needed to land on the red planet and return the astronauts home			1
but with a view to one day making the journey a reality , @entity9 has released a video that shows the steps that will need to be taken to get there			1
they explain how two of the six pieces needed for @entity1 travel , @entity21 ’s @entity20 and @entity22 , are in production now - but we ’ll need a much bigger spacecraft to make the dream a reality			1
in a video they have outlined the six steps needed to land and return ( illustrated )			1
two are already in production - the @entity22 spacecraft and @entity20 rocket			1
the other four things needed are a large ' tug ' spacecraft , a habitat , lander and an ascent vehicle 1			1
@entity22 ( in production ) 2			2
@entity20 rocket ( in production ) 3			1
@entity43 ( concept ) 4			0
@entity1 ascent vehicle ( concept ) 5			2
space tug ( concept ) 6			0
inflatable heat shield ( in testing ) ‘ today somewhere out there in the world , in a classroom , somewhere between the age of 10 and 20 , the person who ’s going to be the first person to set foot on @entity1 is out there , ’ explained @entity9 ’s director of @entity50 , @entity49 , in a video for @entity9			1
‘ and it ’s really exciting to think what that person ’s life will be like , and how they will live after this big mission			0
’ @entity9 is heavily involved in a future @entity1 mission ; as the prime contractor for @entity21 ’s huge @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , they are building the rocket which will be a necessity for getting to @entity1			1
it ’s not just technology that will be an issue with getting to @entity1 ; owing to the orbits of @entity73 and @entity1 there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place			1
our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles ( 54.6 million km ) , but can be as distant as 250 million miles ( 400 million km )			0
for this reason spacecraft to @entity1 , such as the @entity82 , have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned			2
the next window is open from january 2016 to april 2016 , and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet			0
for a future manned mission , they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one , which will take two years in total			2
just getting there will take seven or eight months			0
the astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back			0
but @entity20 is just one piece in a complex six - piece puzzle that includes the recently launched @entity22 spacecraft			1
@entity21 is committed to getting astronauts to @entity1 in the mid 2030s , and mr @entity49 explained that what is needed in the intervening 20 years will be proving ground missions to make it a reality			1
‘ it takes six pieces to get to @entity1 , ’ he said			2
the current plan begins with @entity20 and @entity22 - these are the two pieces needed to escape and return to @entity73			1
‘ if you ’re going to go to the moon or farther you need a really big rocket to do that , and that ’s what the @entity20 is all about , ' he continued			2
getting to @entity1 , though , will probably require ‘ five or six ’ sls launches according to mr @entity49			0
the next piece that will be needed is a deep space tug of some kind			0
this will be a large spacecraft that carries @entity22 and the other equipment			2
this deep space transportation system will be powered by huge solar panels and will probably use solar electric propulsion ( @entity127 ) , or ion propulsion			0
‘ it uses the power from the sun to drive the propulsion system , so they look like large sailing ships , ’ explained mr @entity49			0
attached to the sailing ship will be a ‘ habitat ’ where the crew will live			0
although not specifically mentioned by @entity9 , it ’s thought this habitat may rotate in order to provide the crew on board with some form of artificial gravity , to prevent their bones degrading too much on their lengthy mission			2
illustrated here is the entire spacecraft that may one day take humans to @entity1			2
it would use solar electric propulsion ( @entity127 ) , or ion propulsion , to get to the red planet			0
giant solar panels will draw power from the sun , while a habitat ( seen to the left of the spacecraft ) would house the astronauts during the journey a huge inflatable heat shield ( illustrated ) , different from the one @entity22 used to return to @entity73 , will take astronauts safely to the surface of @entity1			1
@entity21 has been testing the technology for such a heat shield through their @entity168 ( @entity169 ) programme the crew will ride on the habitat on their way to @entity1 before detaching once they have reached their destination			1
once arrived they will leave the habitat in orbit while the crew goes down to the surface			0
the last two pieces that are needed for the mission are a lander , and an inflatable heat shield			1
the huge inflatable heat shield , different from the one @entity22 used to return to @entity73 , will take them safely to the surface of @entity1			1
@entity21 has been testing the technology for such a heat shield through their @entity168 ( @entity169 ) programme			1
@entity186 will enable the lander to touch down on the surface after it drops the heat shield , ‘ much like the lunar lander did on the moon ’ said mr @entity49			1
a mission to @entity1 will take about two and a half years			2
astronauts will spend about eight months getting there and eight months back , and probably about a year on the surface ( illustrated ) ‘ today somewhere out there in the world , in a classroom , somewhere between the age of 10 and 20 , the person who ’s going to be the first person to set foot on @entity1 is out there , ’ explained @entity9 ’s director of @entity50 , @entity49 ( pictured ) the @entity20 heavy lift rocket ( illustration shown ) is being built by @entity9			1
it will be a necessity for a future manned mission to @entity1 , and will fly for the first time in 2019 eventually , once their operations on the surface are complete , they will use a ‘ little rocket ’ to return to the habitat in orbit and , ultimately , to @entity73			1
together , all of this infrastructure will allow a group of humans to take the first footsteps on @entity1			0
and some , including mr @entity49 , believe this may be the first step to colonising the red planet and having a permanent human settlement there			0
‘ i think we ’ll be able to colonise @entity1 some day , ’ mr @entity49 concluded			0
‘ it may take hundreds of years , but that ’s not unusual for humans			0
‘ it ’s really about establishing a human foothold on the planet			0
it ’s a natural evolution of humanity to take this challenge on			0
' @entity22 is one of the six pieces of the puzzle to get astronauts to @entity1			2
it will be used to take astronauts out of @entity73 's gravity well , and return them home after the mission is completed			0
last friday it completed its first test flight , successfully entering into a high orbit before splashing down in the @entity242 ( shown )			0

@entity29 - based @entity9 has revealed how to get to @entity1

two are already in production - the @entity22 spacecraft and @entity20 rocket

@entity9 and @entity21 expect a mission to @entity1 to take place in the 2030s
