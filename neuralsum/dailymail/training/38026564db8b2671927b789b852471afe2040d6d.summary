by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 8 march 2014 updated : 04:28 est , 9 march 2014 when @entity3 and @entity4 appeared on @entity5 back in 2004 after buying an enormous ruin in rural @entity7 , a sceptical @entity2 proclaimed they ’d got ‘ carried away with the romance of it all ’ – and was n’t at all sure they ’d ‘ thought it through ’			1
the couple , both divorcees who had met five years previously , bought the tumble - down @entity16 manor house on a whim after stumbling across an advert for it online			1
the odds did n’t look good – neither of them spoke @entity7 , they had no experience with building work and they had n’t even been intending to move overseas when they bought the house just two days after spotting it			1
they sold their @entity29 home and gave up steady jobs in @entity31 ( @entity3 was an engineer and @entity4 worked in sales and marketing			1
it was discovered and burnt down by the @entity45 in 1944 , and since then it had not been touched			2
but just a few months after first seeing the property , @entity2 was forced to eat his words			2
‘ every time i ’ve visited i ’ve been more and more blown away by @entity3 and @entity4 , ’ he said on the show			2
‘ they ’ve proved that through sheer dogged optimism , it ’s possible to tackle almost anything			2
’ fourteen months after buying the manor house , the couple , who lived in a caravan in the garden while the work was being done , opened their doors to paying guests			2
dilapidated : this is what the mansion looked like before the restoration 11 years ago , having not been touched since the @entity45 army destroyed it in 1944 pride and glory : the property was the headquarters of the local resistance movement during @entity73 and was left untouched for nearly 60 years big project : @entity3 and @entity4 appeared on @entity5 back in 2004 after buying the enormous ruin in rural @entity7 now , ten years after the show aired on @entity78 , they have put the property on the market for € 599,960 – about £ 495,000			1
both 64 , they are keen to retire and spend more time with their children and grandchildren ( they have five children and four grandchildren between them			0
) their pensions wo n’t allow them to maintain a large property like @entity91 , which comes with four acres of land , without keeping it running as a business			0
‘ it breaks our hearts to have to sell and we ’re doing so with a lot of regret , ’ says @entity3			0
‘ but it ’s an experience we can look back on and say , wow , we did that			0
’ something about the intrepid pair must have struck a chord with @entity5 viewers			1
since @entity107 opened its doors in november 2004 , they have been inundated with bookings from viewers charmed by the couple ’s @entity7 dream			1
some guests have been from as far as @entity115 , where the show aired a couple of years after it did in @entity31			0
converted : @entity2 initially told the couple they had gotten ' carried away with the romance of it all ' but was forced to eat his words ‘ in the first few years all our guests were viewers of the show , ’ says @entity4			0
‘ we have n’t had to spend any money on marketing at all			0
now we get a lot of word - of - mouth bookings and return visitors and people who ’ve read the reviews online			1
’ @entity3 adds : ‘ we ’ve met people from every continent in the world			0
the international gatherings around our dining tables in the evenings have been really great			0
’ he says the couple often have house - hunters staying with them – perhaps hoping they ’ll be able to pick up some advice			2
the @entity36 region has about 10,000 @entity31 residents and attractions include @entity145 , @entity7 ’s largest man - made lake ( a 15 - minute drive from @entity91 )			1
since the show , the couple have carried on building			0
when they started having guests , only the first two storeys were habitable			0
they completed the rest of the house , which now has seven en suite bedrooms , in 2006			0
in 2009 they converted the derelict barn into two self - catering gites			2
@entity3 and @entity4 bought @entity91 for £ 36,000 in 2003 and although they originally earmarked about £ 100,000 for doing it up , like most @entity162 they far exceeded their budget			2
‘ the total must be about half a million euros , ’ admits @entity4			0
the couple are n’t selling @entity91 as a business as they would have to pay capital gains tax , although they are happy to offer advice to buyers who want to run a similar concern			0
they plan to stay in the area and buy or even build something smaller			0
according to @entity177 of @entity179 estate agents , who are selling the property , now is a tricky time to be selling as the market is depressed in @entity7			1
prices in the @entity36 dropped by almost 16 per cent last year , compared to three to four per cent in the rest of @entity7 , and many homeowners are in negative equity			1
‘ prices are set to drop further this year			0
so it ’s definitely a buyers ’ market , ’ says @entity177			2
the @entity189 was a collection of movements that fought against the @entity192 occupation of @entity7 and against the collaborationist @entity194 régime during @entity73 @entity196 cells were small groups of men and women who carried out guerrilla warfare that helped @entity202 soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines			1
the men and women of the @entity196 came from all economic levels and political leanings of @entity7 society , including conservatives , liberals , anarchists , and communists			1
@entity214 , @entity73 , @entity215 of @entity7 forces the @entity189 played a significant role in facilitating the @entity219 ' advance through @entity7 after the invasion of @entity221			1
the @entity196 also planned and executed acts of sabotage that hampered the @entity192 occupation , such as destroying @entity192 electricity grids and several other parts of the infrastructure			0
the @entity196 was coordinated in part by @entity7 symbol @entity229 , the commander of @entity7 forces in @entity31 , who later went on to be elected president of @entity7			1
@entity7 resistance soldiers and @entity202 soldiers fighting together against the @entity192 @entity45 occupation			1

it was the hq for the local resistance during @entity73
