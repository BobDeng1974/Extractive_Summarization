weighing up the number of single - origin coffee shops , alternative food trucks , organic farmers markets , indie bands and eclectic professions , @entity10 , @entity11 took the list 's top spot thanks to its booming art scene and avant garde buildings			1
coming in a close second was another @entity24 hotspot , @entity26 ’s @entity25			1
the city ’s oldest neighborhood boasts the highest concentration of street murals in the city , plus handfuls of alternative and locally owned bars and restaurants , thrift shops and galleries			2
first place : @entity10 , @entity11 is known as an eclectic enclave with some of @entity4 's most lauded food trucks and farmer ¿ s markets , a well - established arts scene and one of the largest creative class communities in the @entity4 determining the trendiest hipster hangouts is not exactly quantifiable			1
as a term that used to describe radical socialists with wild ideas and an artist bent in the @entity52 , it now embodies @entity53 wearing , fixed - gear bike riding , and beard growing youngsters			2
the @entity4 @entity58 dictionary describes a hipster as ' somebody who follows the latest trends and fashions			2
' so @entity1 enlisted the help of @entity26 - based start up @entity64 , a neighborhood - specific private social networking site with a community focus			1
analyzing data on over 250 neighborhoods in the largest @entity4 cities each area was assessed by walkability according to @entity73 , a website promoting walkable neighbourhoods according to their proximity to coffee shops , local food trucks , farmers markets , locally owned bars and restaurants and galleries			2
second place : mission district , @entity26 has diversity and lack of pretense , with easygoing restaurants , bars , coffee shops , and food trucks in @entity26 's oldest neighbourhood third place : @entity7 , @entity8 in @entity95 is thought of as the birthplace of hipsterdom as we know it today , with boutique shopping , a thriving music scene , food trucks and great transit options fourth place : @entity105 , @entity104 started attracting artists and young adults in the @entity108 , and the community is known for its galleries , music venues , boutiques and trendy food options fifth place : @entity115 , @entity116 , is known for its art galleries , studios and coffee with the second highest concentration of coffee shops per capita on the list these were then ranked accord to @entity126 's ratings , with @entity64 's ' hipness ' index also taken into account , which is based on how often words associated with @entity131 , like art , gallery , designer , musician , appeared on each @entity64 neighborhood ’s site pages @entity64 then conducted a survey in which members sounded off on their communities , and the percentage of residents who work in artistic occupations was also factored			1
while @entity25 , @entity145 's lower rents were taken into account for its ranking of second place , with @entity149 , vice president of @entity64 concluding it makes ' a great neighborhood for young trendsetters , ' - a euphemism for underpaid and struggling artists - @entity7 , @entity8 , despite its skyrocketing rental prices , came in third			1
superstar hipsters : @entity157 's @entity156 is a regular visitor of @entity158 ( left ) , as is @entity159 the unofficial birthplace of hipsterdom , @entity7 is teeming with boutique coffee shops , food trucks , alternative nightlife , farmers markets , rustic restaurants , and small boutiques			1

@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity95 4			2
@entity105 , @entity104 , @entity168 5			2

@entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 8			0

@entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 19			0
@entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 20			0
@entity206 , @entity207 , @entity174 its artsy residents that routinely sport @entity212 sneakers and meaningless tattoos while carrying the latest @entity95 and @entity215 coffee cup on a sunday morning helped to single - handedly spawn the hipster craze as we know it today			0
coined ' @entity221 's by the @entity222 ( standing for bohemian - bourgeois ) , these attractive youngsters have helped rents rise , much like @entity224 before it , leading to a slight exodus of artists and a new influx of families as gentrification progresses			1
@entity232 , a research associate with the @entity233 , a nonprofit educational group for community developers , said ' the more successful neighborhoods like @entity7 become in attracting people , the real estate prices go up and a lot of the urban pioneers end up moving on , ' @entity116 , @entity231 ’s @entity115 , ranked number five on the @entity1 list thanks to its closely clustered coffee shops - with the second - highest concentration of coffee shops of any neighborhood on the list - its flourishing foodie culture , including the @entity247 , a colorful collection street art and obviously , its music scene			0
however as a neighbourhood that has been undergoing urban renewal since the @entity253 , some hipsters are fleeing the rising costs of new high - rise condos and warehouse - to - loft conversions for the less established , and less pricey , @entity257 and the @entity259 neighborhoods			0
clearly next year 's top 20 hipster hangouts could look completely different .			1
