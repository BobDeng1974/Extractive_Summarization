@entity8 denied it and sir @entity48 was asked about the story and said : ' look who wrote it			1
' it was n’t meant as a compliment and indeed the story was wrong			0
the fee – confirmed two months later – was £ 5m more			0
name one thing you ’d change about the transfer window … i would end it when the season starts			0
hard to do , of course , unless all the major @entity63 leagues agreed to start on the same day			0
penned : @entity46 ( next to @entity64 and @entity65 ) signed for @entity44 five years ago @entity66 - @ @entity67 1			0
best bit of business so far … @entity70 from @entity71 to @entity72 : good player who will thrive back in @entity73			1
not showing it yet , but @entity75 could be excellent for @entity76			1
which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window ? @entity80 joins @entity6 for £ 60m - just to make it a three - way title race			1
name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on monday … @entity32 to @entity8 4			1
what ’s your best / biggest transfer exclusive of your career ? the most significant was the transfer of an unknown 16 - year - old to @entity6			0
it got about 50 words in the paper			0
i told the desk @entity94 would be good			1
name one thing you ’d change about the transfer window … transfer deadline day to become like the @entity100 draft			0
all the chief executives to be herded into the @entity102 , watched by a crowd to do all their business in public			1
a fleet of helicopters on standby to fly players from around the country for medicals and grand unveilings			0
sitting , waiting , wishing : @entity37 's @entity112 expects @entity33 defender @entity32 to move to @entity8 @entity113 : @entity94 ' move to @entity6 in 2003 went almost unheralded but was noted by @entity112 @entity115 - @ @entity116 1			1
best bit of business so far … @entity119 smoothly concluding the contract extensions of their star players			2
the deals to re-sign @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 happened during the window			0
you do n’t have to buy players from elsewhere to make your squad stronger			2
which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window ? @entity133 making a £ 10million bid to take @entity135 and being successful with it			2
@entity137 needs a keeper , @entity135 has been ditched by @entity19			0
it wo n’t happen as the clubs wo n’t do business with each other – as proven by @entity143 – but it would help @entity133 considerably if it did			2

fantasy : @entity37 's @entity148 wants @entity133 to succeed with a bid for @entity19 's @entity135 you 're not going over there ? @entity28 would be a seen as a major coup for the @entity29 4			2
what ’s your best / biggest transfer exclusive of your career ? @entity157 to @entity119 from @entity158 in september 2001			0
i was 23 , had the story confirmed by @entity161 one friday morning and got the tale in print in the old ‘ @entity119 final ’ edition , in the days when evening papers were still published in the evening			0
@entity157 was n’t the biggest name , he was n’t a @entity119 great but it was the first time i ’d had ‘ exclusive ’ next to my byline for a transfer story			0
name one thing you ’d change about the transfer window … it does n’t need changing now			0
everyone knows how it works , everyone looks forward to the drama of the final day ; let ’s just leave it as it is			0
@entity182 – @ @entity183 1			0
best bit of business so far … @entity19 identifying what they need – a goalscorer and central midfielder – and duly bringing in @entity18 and @entity191 at a cost of £ 62million , less than what @entity8 paid for @entity187			1
@entity195 ’s acquisition of £ 5m @entity196 right back @entity193 also looks very shrewd			0
he ’ll no doubt be sold for £ 12m within the next 18 months , however			0
which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window ? @entity195 sign a goalscorer , for a half decent side will go to waste without someone to put the ball in the back of the net			1
to that end , @entity206 for £ 10m from @entity76 would make a lot of sense			1
makes sense : @entity37 's @entity211 believes @entity195 should shell out £ 10m for @entity76 's @entity206 expected : @entity213 's @entity212 should make the £ 6m switch to @entity76 before monday 's deadline 3			1
name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on monday … @entity217 to @entity218 on a season - long loan			2
the @entity133 striker is still playing a waiting game with the @entity218 - who have had a £ 14m bid accepted - but the arrival of @entity225 at @entity226 could make his mind up and a loan move is more likely			1
what ’s your best / biggest transfer exclusive of your career ? when i was nine years old i saw @entity218 midfielder @entity234 in a restaurant next to @entity236			0
it was close - season and he was with two men in suits			0
i went home and told all of my friends he was signing for @entity195 , which the very next day he duly did			0
today , i would have posted a selfie on @entity245 with @entity234 and it would have been on @entity1 within half an hour			0
as it was back in 1992 , i had my exclusive for 24 hours			0
name one thing you ’d change about the transfer window … one ? ? undisclosed fees for a start			0
but while we ’re at it , the window should shut on the thursday before the @entity29 season starts			0
@entity257 - @ @entity258 1			0

what ’s your best / biggest transfer exclusive of your career ? @entity305 to @entity306 on a free this summer			2
name one thing you ’d change about the transfer window … that it gets smashed into a thousand shards and does n’t exist			0

name one thing you ’d change about the transfer window …			0
transfer fees were independently verified to prevent buying and selling clubs misleading the fans ( and us ) with bogus figures eg. @entity341 and @entity133 over @entity342 that did n't last long ! @entity331 ( right ) spent just six months at @entity133 before rejoining @entity71 @entity344			1

@entity294 's future is still up in the air with @entity8 keen
@entity322 could make a move in the *opposite* direction to @entity323
@entity32 of @entity33 is wanted by @entity352
@entity71 want to sign @entity145 on loan from @entity326
@entity212 is expected to complete a move from @entity213 to @entity76
@entity94 and @entity18 are seen as the summer 's best business
