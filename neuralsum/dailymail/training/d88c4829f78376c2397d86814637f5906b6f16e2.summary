the idea of storing information in living cells has been the plot of sci - fi fantasies such as @entity5 , starring @entity6 - and today it has become reality it sounds like the stuff of science fiction fantasies , but scientists have turned living cells into data storage devices - like ' living hard drives '			1
the idea of storing computer information inside living cells - or human brains - has formed the plot of sci fi thrillers such as @entity5 ( pictured )			1
but in reality , the cells are likely to become a method for retrieving information from inside the human body			1
the information - stored in the @entity27 code - can be rewritten and erased at will , so could be used to study ageing cells , and even ' turn off ' cells before they turn cancerous			1
the cells would be like tiny computers that can ' live ' with the body - and could be an incredibly important tool for both computing and medicine			1
‘ it took us three years and 750 tries to make it work , but we finally did it , ’ said @entity36 , phd , of his latest research , a method for repeatedly encoding , storing and erasing digital data within the dna of living cells			1
bonnet , a postdoctoral scholar at @entity48 , worked with graduate student @entity49 and assistant professor @entity50 , phd , to reapply natural enzymes adapted from bacteria to flip specific sequences of dna back and forth at will			2
all three scientists work in the @entity55 , a joint effort of the @entity57 and the @entity58			2
in practical terms , they have devised the genetic equivalent of a binary digit — a ‘ bit ’ in data parlance			1
‘ essentially , if the dna section points in one direction , it 's a zero			2
if it points the other way , it 's a one , ’ @entity49 explained			2
‘ programmable data storage within the dna of living cells would seem an incredibly powerful tool for studying cancer , aging , organismal development and even the natural environment , ’ said @entity50			1
researchers could count how many times a cell divides , for instance , and that might someday give scientists the ability to turn off cells before they turn cancerous			2
in the computer world , their work would form the basis of what is known as non-volatile memory — data storage that can retain information without consuming power			1
the team calls its device a ‘ recombinase addressable data ’ module , or @entity94 for short			1
they used @entity94 to modify a particular section of dna within microbes that determines how the one - celled organisms will fluoresce under ultraviolet light			2
¿ it took us three years and 750 tries to make it work , but we finally did it , @entity101 said @entity36 , @entity50 , of his latest research , a method for repeatedly encoding , storing and erasing digital data within the dna of living cells the microbes glow red or green depending upon the orientation of the section of @entity27			1
using @entity94 , the engineers can flip the section back and forth at will			0
they report their findings in a paper that will be published online may 21 in the @entity119			0
‘ previous work had shown how to flip the genetic sequence — albeit irreversibly — in one direction through the expression of a single enzyme , ’ @entity36 said , ‘ but we needed to reliably flip the sequence back and forth , over and over , in order to create a fully reusable binary data register , so we needed something different			1
’ ‘ the problem is that the proteins do their own thing			0
if both are active at the same time , or concentrated in the wrong amounts , you get a mess and the individual cells produce random results , ’ @entity49 continued			0
the researchers found it was fairly easy to flip a section of @entity27 in either direction			1
‘ but we discovered time and again that most of our designs failed when the two proteins were used together within the same cell , ’ said @entity50			0
‘ ergo : three years and 750 tries to get the balance of protein levels right			1
’ @entity36 has now tested rad modules in single microbes that have doubled more than 100 times and the switch has held			0
he has likewise switched the latch and watched a cell double 90 times , and set it back			0
the latch will even store information when the enzymes are not present			2
in short , @entity94 works			0
it is reliable and it is rewritable			0
for @entity50 and the team , the future of computing then becomes not only how fast or how much can be computed , but when and where computations occur and how those computations might impact our understanding of and interaction with life			0
‘ one of the coolest places for computing , ’ @entity50 said , ‘ is within biological systems			0
’ his goal is to go from the single bit he has now to eight bits — or a ‘ byte ’ — of programmable genetic data storage			1
‘ i 'm not even really concerned with the ways genetic data storage might be useful down the road , only in creating scalable and reliable biological bits as soon as possible			1
then we 'll put them in the hands of other scientists to show the world how they might be used , ’ @entity50 said			0
to get there , however , science will need many new tools for engineering biology , he added , but it will not be easy			0
‘ such systems will likely be 10 to 50 times more complicated than current state - of - the - art genetic engineering projects , ’ he said			0
for what it is worth , @entity195 anticipates their second bit of rewritable dna data will arrive faster than the first and the third faster still , but it will take time			2
‘ we 're probably looking at a decade from when we started to get to a full byte , ’ he said			0
‘ but , by focusing today on tools that improve the engineering cycle at the heart of biotechnology , we 'll help make all future engineering of biology			0

sections of living @entity27 glow red or green to store computer data
could be used like computers inside the body
@entity27 storage can be written , rewritten and erased at will
' took us three years and 750 attempts , ' says lead researcher
