the @entity1 tortured @entity3 detainees captured after the 9/11 attacks , president @entity0 said friday , in some of his most expansive comments to date about a controversial set of @entity8 practices that he banned after taking office			1
' we tortured some folks , ' @entity0 said at a televised news conference at the @entity14			0
' we did some things that were contrary to our values			0
' addressing the impending release of a @entity19 report that criticizes @entity8 treatment of detainees , @entity0 said he believed the mistreatment stemmed from the pressure national security officials felt to forestall another attack			1
he said @entity1 should not be quick to pass judgment through the lens of a seemingly safer present day			0
'' it 's important not for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect , ' he said			0
@entity0 said friday that a forthcoming @entity19 report will confirm that the @entity1 tortured @entity3 detainees after 9/11 in a picture that became emblematic of @entity1 torture , an unidentified detainee was forced to stand on a box with a bag on his head and wires attatched to him in late 2003 hooded protesters were common sights in front of the @entity14 in 2005 during the @entity44 administration , after methods of torture practiced against @entity48 detainees were first aired publicly and then - vice president @entity49 worked to exempt the @entity8 from a ban on ' enhanced interrogation ' techniques ' i understand why it happened			1
i think it 's important to recall ... how afraid people were ' after the 9/11 attacks , @entity0 added			1
' people did not know if more attacks were imminent			0
' that view , which he expressed as a candidate for national office in 2008 and early in his presidency , explains why @entity0 did not push to pursue criminal charges against the @entity44 era officials who carried out the @entity8 program			2
to this day , many of those officials insist that what they did was not torture , which is a felony under @entity1 law			0
the president 's comments are a blow to those former officials , as well as an estimated 200 people currently working at the @entity8 who played some role in the interrogation program			0
in 2009 , @entity0 said he preferred to ' look forward , not backwards , ' on the issue , and he decided that no @entity8 officer who was following legal guidance_however flawed that guidance turned out to be – should be prosecuted			2
a long - running criminal investigation into whether the @entity8 exceeded the guidance – which is an allegation of the @entity19 report – was closed in 2012 without charges			1
still , @entity0 's remarks on friday were more emphatic than his previous comments on the subject , including a may 2009 speech in which he trumpeted his ban of ' so - called enhanced interrogation techniques , ' and ' brutal methods , ' but did not flatly say the @entity1 had engaged in torture			2
at an april 2009 new conference , he said , ' i believe that waterboarding was torture and , whatever legal rationales were used , it was a mistake			0
' in addition to water boarding , the @entity8 used stress positions , sleep deprivation , nudity , humiliation , cold and other tactics that , taken together , were extremely brutal , the @entity19 report is expected to say			1
@entity0 on friday did not mention a specific method , but he said the @entity8 used techniques that ' any fair minded person would believe were torture			2
' @entity0 banned torture techniques after he took office in 2009 , but acknowledged the nature of the interrogation methods on friday , saying @entity1 should n't be ' sanctimonious ' about them in retrospect ' against our values ' and not just by the @entity8 : @entity1 soldiers were filmed posing with nude , hooded @entity123 prisoners at the infamous @entity125 prison ' we crossed a line , ' he said			1
' that needs to be understood and accepted ... we did some things that were wrong , and thats what that report reflects			0
' @entity0 on friday did not address two other central arguments of the soon - to - be - released @entity19 report – that the brutal interrogations did n't produce life - saving intelligence , and that the @entity8 lied to other elements of the @entity1 government about exactly what it was doing			1
the president also expressed confidence in his @entity8 director , @entity141 , in the wake of an internal @entity8 report documenting that the spy agency improperly accessed @entity19 computers			1
there have been calls for his resignation on @entity149			0
@entity0 said the internal report made clear that " some very poor judgment was shown , " but he seemed to say it was n't @entity141 's fault , and he praised his director for ordering the inquiry in the first place .			2

@entity8 used water boarding , stress positions , sleep deprivation , nudity , humiliation , cold and other tactics against @entity3 detainees
a @entity19 report is expected to be made public in the coming days *outlining* the details
@entity0 said @entity1 should not ' feel too sanctimonious in retrospect '
' i understand why it happened , ' he said ; ' people did not know if more attacks were imminent '
