a 20 - month - old baby died in hospital after she was prescribed an ' exceptionally high ' dose of potassium while recovering from a ' textbook ' operation , an inquest was told			1
@entity7 suffered a heart attack after undergoing a number of procedures , including a gastrostomy , at @entity12			1
the inquest heard that medics who were responsible for her care failed to check her blood levels for three - and - half hours as she recovered in the hospital 's intensive care unit			1
@entity7 suffered a heart attack after undergoing the procedure at @entity12			1
her parents , @entity22 and @entity23 , ( pictured ) told doctors that their daughter looked ' peaky ' , the inquest heard @entity7 died in june 2012 , just moments after her parents , @entity22 and @entity26 , had voiced concerns that their daughter appeared to be struggling to breathe , the inquest heard			1
the toddler suffered from a number of complex illnesses including cardiac and respiratory problems that meant her potassium levels had previously fluctuated wildly			1
in response , a pharmacist prepared a large dose of potassium			2
he told the inquest that he had never dealt with such high concentrations in his whole career			0
but staff admitted that they then did not check @entity7 's blood levels again for a number of hours , despite the unusually high dosage			1
potassium , a mineral that the body needs to work normally , helps nerves and muscles communicate			2
it also helps move nutrients into cells and waste products out of cells			0
a normal potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.5millimoles per litre			2
however @entity7 had a history of fluctuating levels - with readings ranging from 1.8 to as high as 8mmol/l being taken in the month before her death			1
@entity7 , pictured , suffered from a number of complex medical conditions including respiratory and cardiac problems before she died @entity7 's first potassium reading on 28 june was of 5.7mmol/l			1
shortly after , her parents described her as looking ' peaky ' and said she was struggling to breathe as she lay in her mother 's arms			2
when her father @entity26 , a radio dj , from @entity72 , @entity73 , alerted the nurse to his daughter 's condition , she called a physiotherapist for assistance and her blood gas was taken again			2
the test revealed that her potassium level had shot up to 8.3mmol/l and her situation became critical			2
the baby slipped into cardiac arrest and , despite frantic attempts to resuscitate her , was pronounced dead a short time later			0
it was later discovered that she had a huge 11mmol/l of potassium in her blood at the time of death			1
at an inquest into her death in @entity93 yesterday , mr @entity26 broke down in tears as he relived the moment he was told that hyperkalaemia - a high potassium concentration - contributed to his daughter 's death			1
he said : ' the procedure , we were told , was ' textbook ' and she would make a full recovery			0
' when we arrived back at the hospital @entity7 was in the cot and looked very uncomfortable , her breathing appeared laboured , she had white secretions on her mouth and she appeared to be hot to the touch			2
' before the cardiac arrest my wife was holding @entity7 on her lap and i was beside her and the consultant came to the cubicle			1
' at that point i decided to ask about what i was seeing on the heart monitor screen			0
he had come to look at the chart			0
i said to him ' is that correct , does that look right to you ? ' ' he looked at her and at the heart monitor and he said something to the effect of , " yes , she does look very peaky , could you please put her back on the bed "			0
' we left the cubicle after we gave her a kiss and we knew something was wrong because the voices started to get louder			0
more members of staff came and we were told she had died			2
' dr @entity137 , a consultant paediatrician at the @entity12 , said @entity7 's body would deal with potassium differently to anything he had ever seen			1
@entity7 's blood readings were taken for a second time after her father @entity26 , a radio dj , from @entity72 , @entity73 , alerted the nurse to his daughter 's condition			1
above , @entity23 with wife @entity22 and @entity7 @entity7 had a history of fluctuating potassium levels even when she was stable , the inquest was told			1
the body needs the mineral to work normally , as it helps nerves and muscles communicate he said : ' this was a little girl who had widely fluctuating levels even when stable and well			0
' the concentration and quantity that she received was n't directly proportional to the potassium in her blood			2
' i have been a consultant for 18 years and have never seen a child with such fluctuating levels of potassium			2
' when asked by @entity170 , representing @entity7 's family , whether it would be ' prudent ' to monitor @entity7 's levels frequently because of their unusual results , dr @entity137 said : ' yes , but where it was practical to do so , given the other cares for her going on			1
' i was happy with them being taken every ninety minutes to two hours and was happy she had previously tolerated a high level of potassium which was outside our normal experience			0
' dr @entity184 , a senior clinical pharmacist at the hospital , constructed the potassium mixture to be used in the two infusion bags administered to @entity7			1
he said : ' this is the first time in my professional career i have needed to make a solution like that			0
' staff nurse @entity192 , who was responsible for @entity7 's care on the intensive care unit that day , admitted she should have checked her potassium levels more regularly while such a large amount was being administered			1
however , she said she had n't been given any specific instructions as to how often they should be taken			0
she said : ' one should be taken every two hours , but circumstances would n't allow it			0
' dr @entity201 , a consultant paediatrician from @entity202 in @entity203 , was asked by coroner @entity204 to prepare a report on @entity7 's care as an expert witness			2
he said : ' it was an exceptionally high concentration of potassium			0
i have used it once or twice but never in a child so small in age or in terms of weight			0
it is an extraordinary situation you are in			0
' the decision to move up from 6 - 12mmol per hour was a bold one and a risky one			0
staff nurse @entity192 , who was responsible for @entity7 's care on the intensive care unit at @entity12 ( pictured ) , admitted she should have checked her potassium levels more regularly i do n't think it was unreasonable to do given the difficulties they had in controlling the potassium but it was a very substantial rise in the amount being given			1
' i think my feeling was if one is going to undertake risks they have to be very careful and monitor them			0
' there was a need for regular monitoring			0
when the blood gas was taken at 4.51pm it should have raised significant concern and alarm because it is a substantial jump up			0
' he conceded that the registrar 's fell below the standard expected as the infusion was n't immediately stopped and issues were n't raised with the consultant doctor on duty			0
coroner @entity204 earlier acknowledged that the family have received admissions from the @entity250 trust about the potassium levels - which the family do not accept as going ' far enough ' in determining responsibility for @entity7 's death			1

@entity7 was given potassium after ' textbook operation '
@entity12 staff ' failed to check blood levels '
the 20 - month - old toddler died after parents voiced concerns to medics
she had suffered from a number of illnesses , including cardiac problems
