' new date pending coordination with @ @entity20			2
' @entity15 will be hoisted aboard the company 's @entity40 rocket from @entity42 , @entity43			2
@entity20 loaded the test flight with non-essential cargo of clothing , food , computers and science equipment			2
@entity9 has successfully launched the @entity40 and @entity15 before , but going to the space station requires more proven precision			1
@entity20 is turning to private companies to carry cargo and eventually astronauts to the space station			2
@entity20 had been confident that the @entity9 mission would be able to go ahead on the scheduled date			1

' i think we 've got a pretty good shot , but it 's important to acknowledge that a lot can go wrong			0
' if the launch is successful , the @entity93 would conduct a series of maneuvers and tests in orbit before @entity20 clears it for approach and berthing at the station			0
it would remain attached to the outpost for several weeks before flying back to @entity103 and splashing down in the @entity104 for recovery			0
the capsule will carry 1,149 pounds ( 521 kg ) of food and non-critical equipment and supplies to the station			0
it is expected to return 1,455 pounds ( 660 kg ) of cargo back to @entity103 , a capability that far exceeds what the @entity69 @entity113 capsules can hold			0
the @entity116 and @entity117 ships that also fly cargo to the station incinerate in the atmosphere after making deliveries and do not return to @entity103 .			0
