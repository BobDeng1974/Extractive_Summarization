@entity0 has targeted @entity3 's @entity2 place after welcoming the chance to play his way into @entity7 's autumn plans			1
an agreement has been reached with the @entity10 clubs for @entity11 to delay naming his squad for the @entity13 against @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 until october 22			1
moved from its original date in july , the change enables @entity2 's head coach to select players on form while offering a series of intriguing sub-plots to the early rounds of league combat			1
@entity0 has targeted @entity3 's @entity2 place ahead of the autumn fixtures @entity3 has been involved in two early season duels with @entity29 of @entity30 and @entity0 himself , who performed well in @entity32 ' defeat at @entity33 on saturday			1
' i 'm good friends with @entity3 , i 've known him for years and i have the utmost respect for him			2
he 's been a fantastic captain and is a great player , ' @entity0 said			1
' but i want his shirt , it 's as simple as that			0
i want @entity42 's shirt and any of those in the back row			0
people like @entity29 are coming up on the outside as well			0
' so of course when you play these guys you want to win the game and win the individual battle			0
@entity0 said @entity3 was a ' good friend ' who h respected but he wanted his place in the side nontheless ' i was n't disappointed at all with the way i played against @entity33 on saturday			1
' putting back the squad announcement has been great , it 's really opened up the competition for everyone			1
' it means players are picked on form			1
the @entity2 shirt is never yours and it 's a level playing field			2
' @entity0 has filled all three back row positions in a nomadic cub career that has included spells in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity14 , but identifies openside as his preferred post			1
@entity7 has delayed the naming of his squad for the @entity13 until october 22 the 29 - year - old believes he can offer the turnover threat missing from @entity2 's established loose trio of @entity3 , @entity42 and @entity76 and insists you do not need a low centre of gravity to be an effective poacher			1
' my favourite position over the last three or four years has been at seven , it 's where i 've played most of my rugby , ' he said			0
' the people i respect in the game play in that position			0
in terms of turnovers and impact i 'm consistently up there in the @entity10			0
i fulfill a role there			0
' the perception people have of an openside is of a squat guy getting over the ball , but size is irrelevant really			0
@entity0 has filled all three back row positions in a nomadic cub career that has included a spell in @entity68 ' if you have someone who has the skill set to do the job , gets around the park and has high involvement , that 's what it 's about			2
' it 's the balance of the back row that 's most important , it does n't matter what number you 're wearing			0
' i just do n't buy into this squat thing ...			0
( @entity17 openside ) @entity116 is an example of someone like that , but he hits like he 's bigger than he is and carries like he 's bigger than he is , but just happens to be that size			2
' but if @entity2 say we 'll play you at six , i wo n't be precious about it			2
