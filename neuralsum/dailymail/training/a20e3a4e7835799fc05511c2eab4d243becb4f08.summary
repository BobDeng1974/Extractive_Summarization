by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 13:23 est , 10 may 2013 an interpreter was not sent to translate for a murder suspect - because the company said it was ' not worthwhile as they will not make enough money '			1
judge @entity6 blasted the decision not to send a mandarin translator for @entity9 , 53 , which forced him to adjourn the case for two months			1
@entity9 had been due to answer four charges of murder at @entity15 today			1

an international search was mounted for @entity9 after the family were found stabbed to death at their home in the quiet suburb of @entity32 , @entity33			2

' it would be completely unfair on mr @entity9 to go ahead without an interpreter			2
' i will be asking for a written explanation to explain what has happened , then consider costs			0
' it is a complete disgrace , some people suggest things have got better , that depends what the starting point is			0
