by @entity0 published : 20:48 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 03:25 est , 21 february 2013 the over- 60s will be able to take out student loans so they can go back to university , the higher education minister announced last night			1
@entity4 claimed that older people who return to higher education to keep their skills up to date will be more likely to keep their jobs			1
the @entity9 minister said that the upper age limit for taking out student loans to cover tuition fees had been lifted			0
@entity4 said older people are more likely to keep their jobs if they retrain and keep their skills up to date he said that the change would allow older people to find ‘ great value ’ in taking a university degree course			1
pointing out that older people are expected to work for longer before retirement than they were in the past , mr @entity4 suggested that they could struggle to compete against the younger working generation			1
he said that the solution would be for them to retrain			0
the minister , who is accompanying @entity20 on his visit to @entity22 , suggested that the new rules would help older workers cope with the pressure that they would face to keep up to date as they worked well into their 60s			2
he said : ‘ there is certainly a pressure for continuing to get retrained and upskilled			0
‘ higher education has an economic benefit in that if you stay up to date with knowledge and skills you are more employable			1
’ the move by the @entity36 is likely to raise fears about whether the older generation of people taking out student loans will have enough time left in which they can pay the money back			1
until now in @entity44 , only students who were younger than 54 have been eligible for a loan to cover tuition fees for a higher education course			1
‘ there was a lot of criticism about the ageism of all this , ’ mr @entity4 said , as reported by the @entity48			2
‘ the regime now is there is no age limit on fee loans			0
’ he said there was a ‘ great value in lifelong learning ’ and education is ‘ not reserved for younger people ’			2
@entity4 said education is ' not reserved for young people ' mr @entity4 said a university course had ‘ wider benefits ’ , making people likelier to lead healthy lives			1
he also said online courses were attracting ‘ a lot of older people ’ who had more free time and so could spend the time studying			1
his comments came after a government report found that the country ’s future economic success depends on the skills and contributions of older workers			2
however , campaigners raised concerns about whether pensioners would be willing to commit to challenging degree courses and further debt			0
dr @entity86 , a pensions specialist , said she was ‘ not convinced ’ that many people would see a three - year university degree costing £ 27,000 as a good investment			0
she said : ‘ i would n’t have thought that three years at university with those kind of costs , and the long holidays that universities have , would be the best thing for older people to take up and pay for			1
’ economists have warned that the ageing population will place an unmanageable burden on taxpayers unless more people work for longer than in the past			0
one in four people will be older than 65 by 2033 and the state pension age is to rise to 67 by 2028			2
last year only 1,940 undergraduates starting courses were older than 50 , out of a total 552,240 students in the @entity108			0
mr @entity4 suggested this figure was expected to rise			0
worryingly , ministers have warned that they have no idea when younger workers in the 30s will be able to retire			0
in january , pensions minister @entity114 admitted it was ‘ too early ’ to predict what future rises in the state pension age will be			0
according to the @entity121 , some 6,455 undergraduates starting courses last year were aged between 50 and 60 years old			0
currently , the majority of older people go back to university for recreational purposes , or take part in other similar academic groups or organisations for their own enjoyment .			1

he said they are more likely to keep their jobs if skills are up to date
