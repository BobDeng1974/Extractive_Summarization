' less petty theft for the @entity9 to be diverting resources to ( they have a dedicated @entity102 theft task force ) , less of your iphones getting stolen			0
@entity102 theft is a very well - documented problem in @entity1 , ' said the person using the name , @entity109			0
@entity7 customers worldwide have been able to download the company ’s latest operating system since september 18			2
it is being hailed as a new beginning for the firm			0
everything from email to the calendar , texts , phone keypad , photos and notes look and work differently on the software			0
importantly , traditional icons have been scrapped under the redesign masterminded by @entity7 's @entity127 design chief sir @entity126			2
text on @entity6 appears sharper than on @entity134 , pictured left @entity7 's @entity6 software includes a new feature called airdrop that lets users share photos , video and contacts simply by clicking share and selecting a fellow @entity6 user from a contacts list the new @entity147 , pictured , allows users to adjust settings and playback with just one swipe from the bottom of the screen @entity126 introduced @entity6 7 as an ' important new direction ' when he showcased the software at @entity7 ’s annual @entity156 in @entity157 earlier this year			1
the operating system has a cleaner look than its predecessors and has been described by @entity7 ’s ceo @entity161 as ' the biggest change to @entity163 since the introduction of the @entity102			2
' its launch last week coincides with the release of two new iphones which went on sale on friday			0
@entity7 's @entity170 is a high - end model that has a fingerprint scanner built into the phone 's home button			1
it also comes with a 64 - bit chip designed to make switching between apps and using the handset and software smoother and faster			0
@entity7 's @entity6 has been designed to make the @entity102 appear bigger			1
its features are deliberately designed to take advantage of the entire screen on iphones and @entity182			0
this has been criticised as @entity7 's attempt to rival phones with larger , five - inch and upward screens including @entity188 's @entity187 and the @entity189			2
text on @entity6 appears sharper , while a @entity147 on the phone allows users to adjust settings with just one swipe from of the screen			2
the @entity170 has a built - in fingerprint scanner that reads a users ' prints using the home button			0
touch id replaces an @entity76 password when buying music , apps or books			2
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - res image scan and the @entity84 in @entity6 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			2
@entity7 reassured users that the feature is secure by explaining ' all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip ' adding the prints are not stored on an @entity7 server , or backed up to @entity94			1
concerns were raised that it could lead to thieves taking drastic action , such as cutting off people 's fingers , in order to access a phone			0
yet , @entity7 's sensor is ' capacitive ' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse			0
additional new @entity6 security features include a @entity230 , that asks for an @entity40 and a password before the feature can be disabled			1
this means if a phone is stolen , the thief ca n't stop the original owner from being able to locate it			0
it will also prevent people from deleting data from the handset			0
the firm has also made password manager apps redundant by introducing an encrypted @entity245 folder that automatically and securely stores multiple account logins and passwords			0
it can save credit card details , too			0
@entity250 , security architect at @entity251 told @entity252 : ' at launch the @entity170 fingerprint reader will only support unlocking the device and @entity7 @entity40 logins			1
' this does raise the bar for users who do n’t currently have a device unlock password but enterprise users will already be required to use either a pin or password to unlock their device so the improvement will be less significant for them			0
' what remains to be seen is whether fingerprint authentication will be extended over time to protect access to the most sensitive information on the device such as corporate email			0
