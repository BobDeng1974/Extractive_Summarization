@entity0 tasted success in his first game as @entity4 coach in a stop - start match against @entity6 that saw former @entity9 centre @entity7 knocked out just 12 seconds into his @entity11 debut			1
former @entity12 forward @entity13 marked his @entity15 debut with the game 's first try and 19 - year - old @entity18 scored his first try for the club as the defending champions ground out an 18 - 7 victory against their injury - stricken opponents			1
@entity6 centre @entity7 knocked out just 12 seconds into his @entity11 debut @entity25 , one of the @entity6 ' major close - season signings , was hurt in the very first tackle of the match at @entity29 as he attempted to bring down @entity15 towering prop @entity30 without ever getting into a position to make the tackle			1
the game was held up for eight minutes before @entity25 was carried off on a stretcher and , although he was later reported to be " fine " , he will have little recollection of his first taste of @entity11 action			2
already without first - choice half - backs @entity38 , who withdrew on the day of the game after failing to shake off a calf strain , and @entity41 , it got even worse for the visitors when @entity43 left the field for treatment after just four minutes , although he was able to return soon afterwards			0
second rower @entity46 , who switched with great effect to @entity25 's centre spot , had an early try ruled out by video referee @entity51 for an obstruction and @entity15 immediately opened the scoring when @entity13 took a short pass from fellow debutant @entity55 and proved unstoppable from five metres out			1
@entity46 of @entity6 looses his footing in a tackle at @entity29 on friday night @entity59 's goal made it 6 - 0 and centre @entity61 looked certain to increase the lead when quick hands from @entity55 and @entity65 got him into space , only for the refreshed @entity43 to somehow dislodge the ball from his grasp			2
the tide began to turn as the @entity6 re-grouped and built pressure on the back of three goal - line drop - outs			0
the @entity73 were also aided by a run of five consecutive penalties , which stretched the patience of referee @entity77 , who sent @entity15 forward @entity78 to the sin - bin on 35 minutes just moments after issuing a final team warning			0
the @entity6 instantly took advantage of the extra man , with hooker @entity83 catching the @entity15 defence napping with a quickly - taken tap penalty			0
@entity13 goes over for the opening try for @entity4 against @entity6 @entity43 kicked the conversion to tie the scores and edged his side into an unlikely 7 - 6 interval lead with a drop goal			1
@entity15 new captain @entity91 was seen apparently remonstrating with @entity77 before storming down the tunnel but the official began to endear himself to the 12,000 home fans by awarding the first three penalties of the second half to @entity15 , one of them for a shoulder charge by full - back @entity98 as he bundled @entity59 into touch just short of the line			0
the pressure told when centre @entity103 took @entity106 's pass to force his way over for @entity4 ' second try three minutes into the second half with his side still down to 12 men			2
@entity110 of @entity4 crashes into @entity111 and @entity112 of @entity6 @entity83 had a second try ruled out for a knock - on and @entity15 made sure of an opening - round win when @entity18 forced his way over from close range for their third try on 57 minutes			1
the @entity6 were down to 12 men by then with winger @entity117 despatched to the sin - bin for a professional foul , holding down @entity106 after he had broken clear and looked a likely scorer , and @entity59 went over for a fourth try five minutes from the end			0
a last - minute skirmish quickly petered out but three yellow cards and one red after just two matches represents a stormy start to the first round of @entity129 .			0

new signing @entity7 was hurt in the very first tackle of the match
the former @entity9 centre was carried off on a stretcher
