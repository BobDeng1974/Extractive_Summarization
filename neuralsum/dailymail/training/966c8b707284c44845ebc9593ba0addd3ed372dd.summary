by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 15 march 2012 updated : 11:59 est , 15 march 2012 a @entity2 expert said limiting a baby 's exposure to mobile phone radiation would be ' warranted ' pregnant women who use mobile phones may be putting their babies at risk of developing behavioural problems , scientists have warned			1
researchers from @entity2 found exposure to radiation from mobiles during pregnancy affects the brain development of offspring , potentially leading to greater activity , anxiety and poor memory			1
they concluded mobiles could have a negative effect on babies in the womb after studying pregnant mice			2
however , a group of @entity28 scientists have poured scorn on the study labeling it ' alarmist and unjustified			1
' they pointed out that the unborn mice would have received a dose of radiation that was proportionally far higher than an unborn baby would get			1
they added that while the whole bodies of the mice were exposed a pregnant woman would tend to hold their phone a metre away from their uterus			2
the experts , from the @entity45 , among others , added that a comparison is impossible between rodents and humans because mice are born after just 19 days with a brain that 's at a far earlier stage of development compared to human babies			1
the introduction of the @entity2 study , published in the latest issue of the journal @entity59 , focuses on the rising number of @entity62 cases in children , implying it could be linked to their research in mice			1
@entity62 is a development disorder characterised by inattention , hyperactivity and @entity69 three and seven per cent of school - age children suffer from the disorder			0
affected children tend to perform poorly at school and are at increased risk of delinquency			0
diagnosis has increased at an average rate of three per year since 1997 , making the condition ' a growing public concern , ' according to the scientists			0
the researchers measured the brain electrical activity of adult mice that were exposed to radiation as foetuses and conducted a series of psychological and behavioural tests			2
they found that the mice that were exposed to radiation tended to be more hyperactive and had increased anxiety and reduced memory capacity			2
senior author professor @entity91 said : ' we have shown that behavioural problems in mice that resemble @entity62 are caused by mobile phone exposure in the womb			1
' the rise in behavioural disorders in human children may be in part due to foetal cellular telephone irradiation exposure			0
' professor @entity91 ( left ) from @entity2 said behavioural disorders could be due in part to phone radiation exposure in the womb but professor @entity105 ( right ) from @entity45 said the claim was ' alarmist and unjustified ' in the study the authors concluded human tests would be needed before ' extrapolating these behavioural findings to humans			1
' but prof @entity91 , who is a member of @entity112 - an organisation ' dedicated to protecting human health from environmental harms through research ' - added that limiting a foetus ' exposure to mobile phone radiation seemed warranted			1
however , professor @entity120 from the @entity121 denounced the study as ' irresponsible			0
' he told the @entity28 charitable trust , @entity125 : ' there is to date only little evidence of an association , ' adding that no evidence from the latest mouse study supported the conjecture			1
professor @entity105 , from the @entity132 at @entity133 , added that the link made between mice and humans was ' alarmist and unjustified			0
' non-comparable : mice are only pregnant for 19 days she said the fact the exposed mice in the study were more active could not be translated to complex disorders such as @entity62			2
she pointed out that anxiety levels decreased in exposed mice whereas it is typically higher in children with @entity62			0
professor @entity148 from @entity133 said the rate of adhd problems has actually been steady for more than 20 years and any increase is most probably due to greater recognition of the disorder			0
a spokesman from the @entity155 , told @entity156 : ' there is no hard scientific evidence that radio signals from mobile phones pose a risk to public health providing they are within @entity163 ( international body ) guidelines			1
' very many studies into the effects of radio waves on health have been published over the past several decades			0
the authors of this study acknowledge themselves that their work had certain limitations			0
' the @entity155 constantly monitors and reviews this scientific research and will consider this study , along with other peer reviewed research , as part of that process			0
' the latest controversial study comes just two years after scientists from the @entity182 , @entity183 , found children exposed to mobile phones in the womb had a 30 per cent rise in behavioural difficulties at the age of seven			1
the study looked at 29,000 youngsters , but some @entity28 scientists said the findings could be due to lifestyle factors rather than mobiles			2
they pointed out that mothers glued to their mobiles may very well be less likely to interact as much with their children .			0

@entity2 expert says it would be ' sensible ' for pregnant women to limit their baby 's exposure to mobile phones
but @entity28 experts say it 's ' irresponsible ' to speculate about human radiation risk from a study on mice
