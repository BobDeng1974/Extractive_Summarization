hundreds of red , white and blue led modules are illuminating lower @entity1 as officials tested the lights atop @entity4 for the first time on friday night			1
the @entity6 and @entity7 said that the beacon is packed with nearly 300 lights and their glow can be seen for up to 50 miles			2
but the skyscraper faces a tense wait as a committee of building experts met friday to judge whether a design change that affects the 408 - foot needle disqualifies it from being counted as the nation 's tallest tower			1
onward and upward : @entity4 towers above all other buildings in @entity1 's @entity21 and has now been declared the tallest building in the @entity23 from miles away : the beacon and spire of @entity4 are lit up , as seen from @entity28 neighborhood of @entity29 new look : the spire of 1 @entity4 was lit up for the first time on last friday the group will announce its decision next week and @entity4 faces some stiff competition from the @entity36 in @entity37 - coincidentally the city where the committee is based			1
rising from the ashes of 9/11 , the new @entity4 tower has punched above the @entity43 skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and become the tallest building in the country			1
@entity47 has it ? the committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights met to decide whether the tower in the @entity54 or the @entity37 is the loftiest			2
but there 's more than bragging rights at stake ; @entity4 stands as a monument to those killed in the terrorist attacks , and the ruling could dim the echo of @entity23 's founding year in the structure 's height			2
without the needle , the building measures 1,368 feet			1
tallest towers : @entity36 , formerly known as the @entity36 , in @entity37 on march 12 , 2008 ( left ) and @entity4 in @entity43 on september 5 , 2013 ( right ) topping out : the 104 - floor @entity4 beats out 110 - floor @entity36 - now that its spire is deemed admissible what 's more , the decision is being made by an organization based in @entity37 , whose cultural and architectural history is embodied by the @entity74 - formerly @entity36 that would be knocked into second place by a vote in favor of the @entity43 structure			1
' most of the time these decisions are not so controversial , ' said @entity80 , an architect and spokesman for the nonprofit @entity82			0
the 30 members of its @entity84 are meeting to render a judgment behind closed doors in @entity37 , where the world 's first skyscraper appeared in 1884			2
the committee , comprising industry professionals from all over the world , will announce its decision next week			0
colorful : the new @entity4 tower has punched above the @entity43 skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and become the tallest building in the country			1
@entity47 has it ? to the point : a committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights is meeting in @entity37 to decide whether a design change affecting @entity4 's needle disqualifies its hundreds of feet from being counted the question over @entity4 , which remains under construction and is expected to open next year , arose because of a change to the design of its tower - topping needle			1
under the council 's current criteria , spires that are an integral part of a building 's aesthetic design count ; broadcast antennas that can be added and removed do not			1
the designers of @entity4 had intended to enclose the mast 's communications gear in decorative cladding made of fiberglass and steel			0
but the developer removed that exterior shell from the design , saying it would be impossible to properly maintain or repair			0
without it , the question is whether the mast is now primarily just a broadcast antenna			0
according to the architecture firm behind the building , @entity136 , the needle will have a communications platform for radio and television equipment			0
contention : the 110 story , 1,450 - foot @entity36 is in competition with the 104 - story , 1,776 - foot ( including spire ) @entity4 , a skyscraper built at the site of the 9/11 attacks @entity80 said the committee might consider amending its height criteria during the friday meeting - a move with much broader implications that could force a reshuffle in the rankings of the tallest buildings in the world			1
if the matter were n't so steeped in emotion it might have set off some of the good - natured ribbing emblematic of the history of one - upmanship between @entity43 and @entity37			0
but @entity4 is a monument to @entity23 resilience admired well beyond @entity1			2
' i do n't think anybody 's going to argue with the pride in building that new tower , ' said 31 - year - old software developer @entity170 , who works across the street from the @entity36			2
' not only is it going to be the tallest building ; it 's going to be one of the strongest buildings in the history of @entity23			1
it 's a marvel of engineering			0
' from great heights : @entity180 , five , looks down from the glass balcony called @entity182 , suspended 1,353 feet in the air and jutting four feet out from the @entity36 's 103rd floor @entity36 ' we take our hats off to them out here in @entity37 and the @entity189 , ' said @entity190 , chairman and chief executive of @entity192 , the firm that manages the @entity36			1
' and we welcome the building to the elite club of the tallest buildings in the world			0
nobody 's looking at this like a competition			0
' still , the @entity74 has a central place in @entity37 's history , speaking to the city 's own tradition of recovering from adversity ever since the 1871 @entity205 and its history of creating architectural marvels , said @entity208 , an archivist at the @entity209			2
@entity136 , headquartered in @entity37 , also designed the @entity74 , which opened as @entity36 in 1973 and remained the tallest building in the world until 1996 when the council ruled that the @entity213 in @entity214 , @entity215 , had knocked it from the top spot			1
and the @entity74 can still claim to get visitors up higher : the highest occupied floor in the 1,450 - foot ( not including antenna height ) , 110 - story @entity36 is still higher up than that of the 104 - story @entity4			2
rising from the ashes : @entity4 , built at the site of the 9/11 attacks on the @entity4 in @entity43 at the @entity74 ' 103rd floor thrill - seekers can step out into one of the glass boxes known as @entity182 that extend outside the building 's steel frame and look straight down 1,353 feet			1
in @entity43 , the debate was upsetting to @entity232 , a retired fire department deputy chief who lost his 29 - year - old firefighter son , @entity233 , in the terrorist attack			0
' you know what ? i think it 's a ridiculous argument			0
it does n't matter to me what height it is , ' he said			0
' you know , my son 's not going to walk back in that door again			0
and that 's the big thing			0

@entity248 lit up for the first time on @entity4 on friday night - and it can be seen from up to 50 miles away
@entity37 - based council on tall buildings also met on friday to decide if the skyscraper will be named tallest building in @entity23
a design change to the building 's spire may disqualify the building from competition
without the spire , it measures 1,368 feet - shorter than @entity37 's @entity36 at 1,450 feet . the council will announce its decision next week
