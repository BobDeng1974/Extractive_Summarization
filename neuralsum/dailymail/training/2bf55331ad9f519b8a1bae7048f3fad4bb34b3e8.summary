for rogue foreign currency traders hoping to rig the system , there was a 60 - second window to cash in			1
at 4pm , the most important part of their day , they used internet chatrooms to share confidential information about orders from clients for foreign currency			2
the corrupt bankers knew they could make hundreds of thousands of pounds profit for their firm – and so boost their bonuses – in a matter of seconds			2
so they would would conspire with each other to move the rate of a currency up and down by placing huge orders and persuading others to follow suit			0
because foreign exchange is a global 24 - hour market , with institutional clients such as pension funds , big companies and hedge funds placing huge orders for currencies , banks take a snapshot of how much is being bought and sold during a 30 - second period just before and after 4pm			1
this is known as the 4pm @entity52 @entity51 and is used as a peg for determining the rates clients receive when they order currency			0
traders pushed the ‘ fix ’ currency rate up or down by submitting a rush of orders during this 60 - second window			1
this skewed the market ’s impression of supply and demand , so changing the price			0
traders placed their own orders before 4pm to profit from the subsequent movement in prices			2
typically they ganged up with traders at other banks as it is easier to move rates up or down if they worked together			0
in the hours before 4pm , tight - knit groups of traders would share confidential information about client orders to buy or sell a particular currency			2
messages were typically exchanged in internet chatrooms , often given colourful nicknames such as @entity84 , the @entity85 and the co-operative			0
punishment : five of the world 's biggest banks , including @entity21 , have been fined a total of £ 2bn for colluding to make money from the foreign exchange market			1
they used a 60 - window in the trading day to rig rates when they failed to make a killing , they would berate each other			1
one @entity21 employee complained to a trader from another bank who had not disclosed a large order in advance : ‘ you are useless … how can i make free money with no * * * * ing heads up			0
’ one bank would typically take the lead if it had received a large order from a client asking to buy a certain currency at the 4pm fix rate			0
shameful : new evidence published by the @entity117 reveals the bragging messages sent by bankers online if the bank sells the currency to the client and then the rate goes up at 4pm it stands to lose money			0
but traders managed this risk by buying currency in the market to sell to clients later			0
if the rate goes down at 4pm then the bank makes money			0
to ensure this happens the trader would work with counterparts at other banks urging them to push through sales of currency during the 60 - second window at 4pm to drive the rate lower			1
in one example , @entity21 colluded with traders from at least three other firms to attempt to drive the sterling - dollar rate fix lower			1
shocking : one conversation between traders led to a deal that made giant @entity19 $ 513,000 and one trader joked about how a colleague bragged about his bonuses the @entity117 said traders had shared confidential information about client orders prior to the fix , and then used this information to attempt to manipulate the fix downwards			2
the sterling / dollar exchange rate fix fell from £ 1.6044 to £ 1.6009 in this particular example , making @entity21 a £ 100,000 profit			1
afterwards , traders congratulated themselves , saying : ‘ loved that mate ... worked lovely ... pity we could n’t get it below the 00 ’ , ‘ there you go			0
. go early , move it , hold it , push it ’ , ‘ nice works gents			0
. i don my hat ’ and ‘ hooray nice teamwork ’			0
in another case @entity22 generated a profit of £ 390,000 in seconds			1
one trader involved in the scam commented later : ‘ we * * * * * * * killed it right ... [ another firm ] , myself and @entity22			0
’ @entity177 was fined a total of £ 399million including £ 217million by the @entity117 and £ 182million by the @entity180 @entity179 ( @entity179 )			1
@entity21 was fined £ 389million including £ 216million from the @entity117 and £ 173million from the @entity179			2
@entity181 bank @entity19 was fined a total of £ 503million including £ 234million by the @entity117 , £ 182million by the @entity179 and £ 87million by the @entity181 regulator @entity183			2
@entity180 's @entity20 was hit with penalties of £ 420million including just under £ 225.6million from the @entity117 and £ 194.6million from the @entity179			1
@entity185 was fined £ 417million including £ 222million by the @entity187 regulator and £ 195million from the @entity179			1
however @entity24 , the third @entity187 bank expected to be fined , said it was ' in the interests of the company to seek a more general coordinated settlement ' with more investigations from other authorities still to come .			1

@entity22 , @entity21 , @entity185 , @entity19 and @entity20 fined in @entity187 and @entity180
@entity24 will also be fined but it is still *negotiating* its punishment
bankers were rigging the £ *3.5trillion* - a - day foreign exchange markets
anyone found *guilty* of manipulating the forex market could face jail
traders used 60 - second window to strike deals and cash in on profit
