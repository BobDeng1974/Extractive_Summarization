by @entity0 for @entity1 in the summer of 1989 @entity3 ’s @entity2 became the first , and to date only , spacecraft to visit the planet @entity6			1
during the brief flyby of the planet on 25 august , the probe returned images of its natural satellite @entity11 , a giant moon bigger even than the dwarf planet @entity15			1
and now a map and video have been revealed stitching together the images in unprecedented detail , creating the most comprehensview of its surface ever seen			1
the movie , using the best @entity2 map in colour , recreates the encounter with @entity11 as @entity2 ended its tour of the giant planets and began its trek into deep space in 1989 the footage was restored by dr @entity27 of the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) in @entity38 , @entity39			1
it is 37 years since the twin @entity42 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from @entity46 has flown before			0
their primary mission was the exploration of @entity50 and @entity51			0
after making a string of discoveries there - such as active volcanoes on @entity57 and intricacies of @entity51 's rings - the mission was extended			2
@entity2 went on to explore @entity60 and @entity6 , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets			1
the current mission for both spacecraft , the @entity63 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity68 's domain and beyond			0
the map has a resolution of 1,970 feet ( 600 m ) per pixel , while the approximately natural colours have been enhanced to bring out the contrast			0
@entity2 's ‘ eyes ’ saw colours slightly different from human eyes , and this map was produced using orange , green and blue filter images			1
when it passed in 1989 , most of the @entity81 was in darkness and was unseen			0
because of the speed of @entity2 's visit - about 15 miles ( 25 km ) per second , and the slow rotation of @entity11 - only the @entity83 was seen clearly at close distance			1
the rest of the surface was either in darkness or seen as blurry markings			0
' the biggest challenge in " restoring " this map was the color of @entity11 , ' dr @entity27 tells @entity1			1
' we had considerable difficulty because some of the colour images were smeared or noisy , and there is some uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the colour images			0
' we also do not know exactly what the colour of @entity11 was in those days			2
@entity46 - based observations gave very different answers			0
' we did our best to give at least an impression of what the colour of this very active body at the edge of the @entity112 looks like			0
' and on his website dr @entity27 explains what is being seen in the video and images			1
‘ @entity2 made a hair - raising pass over @entity6 ’s large @entity11 in august 1989 , ’ he wrote			1
‘ approaching from the deep south , @entity2 passed over the north pole of cloud - swept @entity6 , almost close enough to brush the far - attenuated upper atmosphere			1
‘ the gravity of @entity6 pulled the spacecraft down toward @entity11 , passing over the unlit north pole of that bitterly cold icy moon			2
’ when @entity2 passed in 1989 , most of the @entity81 ( left ) was in darkness and was unseen			2
because of the speed of @entity2 's visit , about 15 miles ( 25 km ) per second , and the slow rotation of @entity11 , only the @entity83 ( right ) was seen clearly at close distance @entity2 is the only spacecraft ever to have visited @entity6 , seen here			1
dark , cold and whipped by supersonic winds , @entity6 is the last of the hydrogen and helium gas giants in the solar system			0
more than 30 times as far from the sun as @entity46 , the planet takes almost 165 @entity46 years to orbit the sun @entity11 is 1,681 miles ( 2,706 km ) across , making it the 16th largest body in the solar system			2
it is also thought to have an icy surface , and may even have clouds in its skies			0
in fact , the moon is thought to bear some similarities to @entity15 , which makes these recent restorations all the more interesting			2
next year on 14 july , @entity3 ’s @entity151 probe will flyby the dwarf planet , and by using the experiences of @entity2 at @entity11 , engineers hope to get as much data as possible out of the mission			1
' the new map of @entity11 sharpens the details a bit but also shows us the entire surface , at least as far as @entity2 could see it , ' dr @entity27 continues to @entity1			1
' it gives us a sense of how dynamic and active this place is			0
more importantly we can compare it with other active worlds like @entity166 and @entity167			0
' perhaps the most important feature of the map is that it gives us a complete and up - to - date picture of @entity15 , her twin , so that we will be ready when @entity151 gets there next summer			2
' and on whether he hope a mission visits again in the future , he added : ' i certainly hope we go back			0
' @entity60 and @entity6 and their strange moons are among the largest bodies on the @entity112			2
' after we go back to @entity166 , the next targets should be @entity60 , @entity6 or both , with modern scientific instruments like @entity185 at @entity51 has			0
' in another historic milestone for the @entity2 mission , 25 august also marks the two - year anniversary of @entity42 reaching interstellar space			1
it is 37 years since the twin @entity42 and 2 spacecraft ( illustrated ) were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from @entity46 has flown @entity196 primary mission was the exploration of @entity50 and @entity51			0
@entity2 went on to explore @entity60 and @entity6 , the only spacecraft to have visited those planets @entity11 is 1,681 miles ( 2,706 km ) across , making it the 16th largest body in the solar system			1
it is also thought to have an icy surface ( illustration shown ) , and may even have clouds in its skies			0
in fact , the moon is thought to bear some similarities to @entity15 , which makes these recent restorations all the more interesting			2

footage of @entity2 's flyby of @entity6 's largest moon has been restored
the project was by the @entity28 in @entity38 , @entity39
the results reveal the surface of the @entity11 in unprecedented detail
in august 1989 @entity2 became the first and only probe to visit @entity6
and it 's mission could help the arrival of @entity151 at @entity15 next year
footage of @entity2 's flyby of @entity6 's largest moon ( animation above ) has been restored by dr @entity27 of the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) . the movie , using the best @entity2 map in colour , recreates the encounter with @entity11 as @entity2 ended its tour of the giant planets and began its trek into deep space in 1989
