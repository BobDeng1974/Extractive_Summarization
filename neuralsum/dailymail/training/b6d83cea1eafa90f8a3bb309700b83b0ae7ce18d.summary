rats have always been blamed for causing bubonic plague outbreaks in @entity2 , but now researchers claim they ’ve been unfairly maligned and that it was actually gerbils that caused repeated epidemics of the disease			1
the revelation comes from @entity9 researchers who say they have compelling evidence that outbreaks of the plague , which killed millions in @entity2 after it arrived in the 14th century , can be traced back to great gerbils ( @entity14 ) from central @entity15			1
they say that the plague - carrying fleas flourished on the rodents before making their way to @entity2 via the @entity20 trading route			1
@entity21 's amazing : @entity9 researchers say they have compelling evidence that outbreaks of the plague can be traced back to great gerbils ( pictured ) from central @entity15 study co-author @entity25 told the @entity26 : ‘ if we 're right , we 'll have to rewrite that part of history			1
’ professor @entity25 and his team drew their conclusion after using tree - ring data to establish medieval weather patterns and compared these with thousands of black death records			2
they found that ideal weather patterns for the spread of the plague did n’t come from @entity2 , but @entity15			1
fifteen years after a warm weather spell in @entity15 , a plague outbreak would occur in @entity2			1
this pattern continued for hundreds of years			0
professor @entity25 said : ‘ we show that wherever there were good conditions for gerbils and fleas in central @entity15 , some years later the bacteria shows up in harbour cities in @entity2 and then spreads across the continent			1
’ gerbils numbers would increase , he said , whenever a hot summer followed a wet spring			0
he added : ‘ such conditions are good for gerbils			0
it means a high gerbil population across huge areas and that is good for the plague			2
an increase in temperature of one degree will double the prevalence of plague in the gerbil population			2
’ the bubonic plague remains one of the most destructive pandemics in history which peaked in @entity2 between 1348 and 1350 humans caught the plague from rats , but researchers say it was actually gerbils that were the original breeding ground for the disease the fleas made their way to @entity2 in various stages			1
some would have arrived via foxes that had eaten the gerbils , which then passed them onto rats , which passed them to humans			0
in other cases humans may have caught the disease from camels , the fleas having jumped to them from the gerbils			0
filthy living conditions in 14th @entity91 have been blamed for allowing the @entity92 to spread			1
it remains one of the most destructive pandemics in history which peaked in @entity2 between 1348 and 1350			2
experts say it reduced the world 's population from an estimated 450 million to almost 350 million in 1400			2
in 1603 the killer plague returned and killed 38,000 @entity101			0
the symptoms of the @entity92 were revolting with historians noting descriptions of fever , muscle spasms , coughing up blood and black blood oozing out of swelling lymph nodes			0
the most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of swollen lymph nodes on the groin , the neck and armpits , which often wept with pus and blood when they burst			0
professor @entity25 ’s study results appeared in the @entity119			0

@entity9 researchers say plague came from @entity129 great @entity128
they say plague - carrying fleas flourished on the *animals* in warm weather
the fleas were then *ferried* to @entity2 via the @entity20 trading route
@entity92 reduced the population in @entity91 by half when it struck
