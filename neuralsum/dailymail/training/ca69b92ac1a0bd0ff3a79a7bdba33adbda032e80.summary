@entity0 aims to spoil @entity4 's opening - day @entity2 party by proving that both he and @entity5 belong in the @entity6			1
all the attention will be on @entity8 for the lunchtime kick - off on saturday as the former @entity11 manager and @entity13 winner takes charge of @entity15 in the league for the first time			1
but @entity0 insists he has to prove himself more than his celebrated counterpart after he was finally appointed on a permanent basis in may following three months as interim boss in the wake of @entity23 's departure			1
aiming high : @entity5 boss @entity0 wants to spoil @entity4 's opening - day @entity2 party on his way : @entity26 and co have left the @entity28 during the close season ' i think i probably need to prove myself a bit more than he does after the career he has had , ' @entity0 told his pre-match press conference ' he is in a different situation to me			1
he is at one of the biggest clubs in the world and at that level the importance of winning trophies is massive so that is a different type of pressure			2
' my pressure comes from my experience being questioned , and that is a different type of question			2
' former club captain @entity0 steered @entity5 to safety at the end of last season but it was often a struggle for the 35 - year - old and @entity6 status was only secured in the closing weeks of the campaign			1
since then @entity5 have sold goalkeeper @entity55 and @entity56 to @entity57 and the @entity59 trio of @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity26 have all departed			1
@entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 have been recruited , but @entity0 admits he could do with ' two or three players ' before the transfer window closes on september 1			1
@entity68 takes no notice , though , of the pundits who claim @entity5 will struggle this term			0
' we 've been written off pretty much every year since i 've been at the club , ' he said			0
' it 's no difference to us - it 's water off a duck 's back			2
' no - one will put me under more pressure than myself			0
i know what i want to do and where i want things to go			0
' if things go as planned , then great			0
if it does n't , then the obvious is the obvious			0
but in terms of what 's been said , they do n't see what we do every day			1
' incoming ! @entity62 has arrived in @entity88 from @entity89 but @entity0 wants more players whatever happens at @entity2 , @entity68 is hoping to spend some time with the @entity91 after the game , with both men at the opposite ends of the management scale when it comes to experience			2
' it would be nice to speak with him after the game , ' @entity0 said			2
' i have done that a lot with some of the managers we have come up against			0
' i have had some good chats and , if the opportunity is there , i will take it			0
' but my focus is on the game and it does n't matter what team they play - if we are not quite at it then we are going to be in trouble			0

the @entity115 have lost @entity60 , @entity26 and @entity61 this *summer*
@entity56 and @entity55 both went to @entity57
@entity0 's side go away at @entity15 on the opening day
