by @entity1 reporter published : 11:42 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 12:43 est , 15 january 2014 a @entity4 woman says she has endured six years of paralysis and memory loss after swallowing poisonous algae while swimming in @entity8 @entity9 was taking a dip in the sea when she unwittingly swallowed microscopic ‘ neurotoxic ’ algae			1
soon afterwards she experienced stomach cramps , which led to fever.five weeks later she developed excruciating pains and paralysis throughout her body which baffled doctors			1
unwell : @entity9 ( with partner @entity18 ) was taking a dip in the sea when she swallowed microscopic ' neurotoxic ' algae			1
she says she endured six years of paralysis and memory loss as a result ms @entity9 , who is in her 30s , was eventually diagnosed with ciguatera , a rare condition which affects the central nervous system			1
she now suffers from a list of allergies and needs to be helped to bathe and get dressed			1
she said : ' my partner @entity29 and i were on a hiking holiday in @entity8 in 2008			0
we went to this quiet isolated beach and noticed that the water had a red tinge to it but i never really thought anything of it			0
' later i found it was a " red tide " caused by algae in the water , but i thought it was normal for the area			1
' red tide is the common name for an algal bloom , a marine phenomenon in which large concentrations of microscopic organisms turn the water red or brown			1
ciguatera poisoning is a form of food poisoning			1
it affects about 50,000 people in the world every year but is often misdiagnosed as @entity58 due to its similar symptoms , and like @entity58 , there is still no guaranteed cure			1
it is caused by eating warm water ocean fish that carry ciguatera poison ( a toxin )			2
this poison is produced by a very tiny organism called a dinofl agellate , which attaches itself to algae growing in warm ocean water reef areas			2
small plant - eating fish eat this toxic algae and in turn are eaten by larger predatory fish which are eaten by humans			2
while not always harmful , some red tides are linked to the production of toxins leading to the mass death of sea life and can have dangerous effects on humans			0
ms @entity9 said : ' usually there are only a few kinds of algae in the water and they are n’t harmful , but when i was there the water had a kind called @entity92 that can turn from a plant into an animal , and then back into a plant			1
' i noticed a lot of weird things in the area			0
there were dead fish everywhere on the beach , just thousands , and the birds were behaving really unusually			0
' they were killing themselves by flying head first onto the beach because the algae had released neurotoxins into their brains , but by that time i had already been into the water			2
' within hours of her swim , ms @entity9 started experiencing symptoms similar to food poisoning and knew something was seriously wrong			1
for two weeks she endured crippling joint and muscle pain , along with fever and memory loss and eventually became so weak she could barely talk			2
she said : ' soon after i started feeling unwell , as though i had food poisoning			0
my muscles and joints hurt all over and i developed a heavy fever			1
' i got home about two weeks later but none of the doctors there could help me because it was a tropical condition and no one knew anything about it			2
' i was told that even if i had n’t gone into the water , the algae still gets blown into the air and into the nearby towns , so i would have gotten it anyway just from breathing			2
' ms @entity9 , who is in her 30s , was eventually diagnosed with ciguatera , a rare condition which affects the central nervous system			1
she now suffers from a list of allergies and needs to be helped to bathe and get dressed ciguatera affects about 50,000 people in the world every year but is often misdiagnosed as @entity58 due to its similar symptoms , and like @entity58 , there is still no guaranteed cure			1
but ms @entity9 , who is cared for by her partner @entity18 , 34 , at their home in @entity147 , @entity148 , found hope in some treatments which relieved the worst of her illness , and for a brief period was able to live a relatively normal life			1
she said : ' when i was given antibiotics , i got a lot better			0
but they only helped me so much			0
' i still need help getting dressed and bathing , as i ca n’t do that by myself any more			2
@entity29 has to help me do normal things			0
' there ’s a whole list of things that i ca n’t eat or be near because they aggravate the condition - eggs , caffeine , alcohol , nuts and seeds , chicken , and anything from the sea			0
' i also ca n’t be near cleaning products which contain ethanol			0
' @entity175 , which produces ciguatera toxin			0
@entity177 accumulates in the flesh of fish and , when eaten by humans , causes severe illness now ms @entity9 hopes to travel to @entity182 with mr @entity18 to see a specialist who may able to help her condition at the @entity185 , but is struggling to raise the money			1
mr @entity18 , a technology journalist , said : ' a trip to @entity182 is simply beyond our means			0
i feel terrible not being able to help @entity190 out , but she is unable to work , and the fact that i provide 24 - hour care means that i am not able to work to the extent needed to bring in the money			0
' while the local health authority has agreed to fund the referral , there is no funding available for travel and / or accommodation			0
' the couple are now appealing for anyone who can help to get in touch via email - on @entity204			0
