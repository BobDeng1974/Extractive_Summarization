documents that will be presented to court in february appear to show that @entity2 knew about the massive scale of the 2010 @entity5 oil blowout weeks earlier than previously stated			1

underestimated : oil gushed unabated for for three months during the 2010 disaster			2
new evidence suggests that that @entity2 vastly understated the scale of the leak for weeks @entity26 , the former @entity2 employee , has been charged with two felony counts of obstruction of justice for allegedly destroying hundreds of text messages during the incident			1
it is alleged that @entity26 deleted the messages he sent to a supervisor , including reports that the amount of oil leaking into the @entity38 was bigger than @entity2 were publicly stating at the time			1
as reported in the @entity42 , on friday mix 's lawyers asked a federal judge in @entity44 for permission to present thousands of emails at the trial in february 2013			1
his attorneys argue that as @entity26 did co-operate with federal officials about the size of the leak , he was not part of a cover - up			0

@entity2 will pay $ 4.5 billion in fines and other fees to settle the charges , the largest payment of its kind in @entity84 history			1
according to the @entity42 , just two days after the explosion , @entity26 emailed a supervisor estimating that the out - of - control well could be leaking between 62,000 and 146,000 barrels of oil per day			2
only two days later , @entity2 told the @entity89 that their best estimate for the leak was 1,000 barrels per day			2

@entity42 also reports on another email , in which a @entity101 oil consultant analyzed video leak sent to him by @entity104 ' i do not think it can be ruled out that the flow at seabed is in the order of 40,000 , ' said the consultant			2
