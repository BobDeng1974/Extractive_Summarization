by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:21 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:53 est , 11 december 2013 tragedy : @entity4 , who friends and family said drank every day , died after falling down the stairs at her home in @entity9 , @entity10 an alcoholic mother - of - three died when she fell down the stairs at her home while drinking alone			1
@entity4 , 30 , was found by her estranged partner			1
the former barmaid , who friends said was once a ‘ yummy mummy ’ , started binge drinking as an 18 - year - old , an inquest heard			1
although she had three children , her drunken nights out escalated into all - day drinking bouts fuelled by huge amounts of cheap cider			2
her best friend @entity26 told the hearing : ‘ she was someone who drank from when she woke up to when she went to sleep			2
’ last june she fell backwards down stairs at her home and suffered a fatal double fracture of the skull			1

last night her mother @entity39 , 48 , warned of the dangers of binge drinking – and said parents should take action			2
she said : ‘ parents of young people who drink too much need look for the signs and give them a lot of love and affection			2
' the way my daughter died could happen to anyone young lady who drinks too much alcohol for her own good			1
' she started drinking when she was a teenager when she used to go out to the pub with her friends like most girls her age			2
but despite liking a drink she used to get up and go to work - she was n't drunk every day			2
worried : @entity4 's mother @entity39 today warned of the dangers of drinking after the inquest into her own daughter 's death ' but it escalated during her relationship with the father of her children and she would drink to blot it out			1
in later life she would phone me sometimes and i could tell she had had a drink because she was slurring her words			2
' she always drank cheap cider and she used to hide empty cans			2
she would hide them in cupboards , in the laundry basket , in the toilet cistern , under the bed , in bags , in handbags			0
' she used to go upstairs quite a lot and that was a sign that she was drinking			0
later i would find empty cans in the bedrooms			0

you have to keep on top of it			0
troubled : the 30 - year - old mother - of - three had struggled to cope with her alcohol problem since she was 18 , her inquest heard ' we tried to help her as much as we could but sometimes we could n't get through to her but other people , like counsellors , could get through to her			1
' i had to hide all the drink in the house			0
towards the end i do n't know how many cans of cider she was drinking			0
' she was very good at putting a happy face on but i did worry about her			0
but then my worst nightmare happened			0
if i could , i would change with her in a heartbeat			0
