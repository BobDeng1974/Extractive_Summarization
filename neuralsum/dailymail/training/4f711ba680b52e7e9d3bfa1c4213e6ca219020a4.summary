by @entity0 the secret ' first son ' of @entity2 has lost his bid to secure a share of the artist 's £ 96million fortune following a dispute in the @entity8			1
@entity9 is legally accepted , but not proven , to be @entity2 's first son from a relationship with fashion student @entity12 in the 1950s			1
mr @entity9 , brother of fashion designer @entity13 , was fighting a clause in his father 's will which meant he would inherit none of the money			2
he was also fighting a clause that meant only two people will ever know exactly who the artist 's estate is handed to			0
@entity24 ( left ) , an alleged ' secret son ' of elusive artist @entity2 ( right ) , has lost a @entity8 battle to lift the lid on the beneficiaries of @entity2 's will , and potentially secure part of it for himself at the time of @entity2 's death three years ago , @entity32 , his trusted solicitor , and @entity34 , one of his daughters , were the sole beneficiaries			1
after legacies and taxes the pair inherited an estimated £ 42million			1
but they have since revealed @entity2 secretly instructed them to pass on money to a list of others , without ever revealing their identities or the sums of money involved			1
mr @entity9 tried to lift the lid on this secrecy by arguing that part of the will was illegitimate , but he failed in his attempt today			0
if he had succeeded it would also have meant @entity2 would have died largely intestate , and his millions would have been handed out to his next of kin , a complicated task given that the exact number of his children is unknown - though the court heard that it was ' at least 14 '			2
@entity2 's only legitimate offspring , two daughters named @entity65 and @entity66 , came from his marriage to @entity68 - a muse of his whom he married in 1948			1
however , he had another four children by @entity72 , a student he had met at the @entity73 in the @entity74 , and another four , including @entity24 and sisters @entity76 , @entity13 and @entity77 , by @entity78			0
after @entity78 left him in 1966 , it is said that he barely saw any of the family for 20 years			0
the @entity82 sculptor @entity81 , a close friend of @entity2 's , estimated that he had at least 500 lovers during his lifetime , while family friends insist that his children could number as high as 30			2
revealing the true beneficiaries of @entity2 's will could have lifted the lid on some of the mystery , but following today 's ruling , only mrs @entity32 and mrs @entity34 will know who receives the money			1
speaking at the @entity8 today , the judge said he could ‘ readily understand ’ mr @entity95 ’s concerns about the secrecy of the will , from which he stood to gain nothing			0
‘ there is a lot of money involved here , so i fully understand these are important issues , ’ he said , before ruling that mrs @entity32 ’s and mrs @entity34 ’s interpretation of the will made ‘ common sense ’			2
@entity2 made his fortune through his portrait work , thought by many to be the best of his generation			0
his most famous work , ' benefits supervisor sleeping ' ( pictured ) , sold for a world - record $ 33.8million in 2008 @entity2 's portraits often featured nudes of his friends and family			1
this portrait is of his daughter , @entity13 although , on the face of it , the will appeared to give the £ 42 million to mrs @entity32 and mrs @entity34 ‘ absolutely ’ , they had since made clear that they held the money only as trustees and were bound to distribute the cash under a cloak of confidentiality			1
‘ they wish to respect the deceased ’s wishes not to disclose the terms of the fully secret trust to anyone who is not a beneficiary , ’ their barrister , @entity131 , earlier told the court			0
the judge said it had ‘ at one time been disputed ’ that mr @entity9 was the artist ’s son from his relationship with fashion student , @entity12 , in the 1950s			0
but it had been accepted , at least for the purposes of the court hearing , that he was ‘ another of @entity2 ’s children ’			0
by his will , the artist specifically left a £ 2.5m tax - free gift and a house in west @entity154 to his assistant of more than 20 years , @entity155			1
a second clause instructed mrs @entity34 and mrs @entity157 to dispose of ‘ chattels ’ on the basis of instructions given during his life			0
one of @entity2 ’s works was also given to the @entity163 in lieu of inheritance tax .			2

@entity2 left estate after legacies and tax - about £ 42million - to his solicitor @entity32 and one of his daughters @entity34
they were to hold money in trust before giving it to secret list of others
however @entity24 , @entity2 's ' first son ' who was not *due* to inherit anything , argued that part of will was not legitimate
judge denied his claim , meaning money will pass to secret beneficiaries
