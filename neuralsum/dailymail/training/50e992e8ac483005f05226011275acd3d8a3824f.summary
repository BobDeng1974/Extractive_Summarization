by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 19:25 est , 6 december 2012 women who are pregnant with their first child or mothers planning to have another baby are among the biggest losers in the mini-budget			2
@entity7 yesterday accused the chancellor of slapping a £ 180 ‘ @entity10 ’ on women			2
in his @entity12 , @entity11 revealed plans to limit the annual increase in most benefits to just one per cent per year for the next three years			1
losing out : @entity16 , pictured with daughter @entity17 , 8 @entity16 , 35 , will lose out when child benefits and child tax credits are increased by a maximum of just 1 per cent			1
the single mother , pictured with daughter @entity17 , eight , claims £ 83 a month in child benefit and £ 131 in working and child tax credits			2
she earns £ 589 working 16 hours a week as an office manager in @entity27 , @entity28 , but can not work more hours or else she would lose her housing benefit of £ 586			2
she can hardly afford her utility bills of £ 100 a month , her rent is £ 825 a month and she still has to find £ 100 for council tax and £ 240 for food			2
miss @entity16 said : ‘ it ’s becoming impossible to survive			2
i have no spare money			2
i am £ 12 overdrawn in my account			2
for the past month i have not been able to do a proper food shop			2
‘ if they ’re not moving things in line with inflation it ’s going to be impossible			2
’ while giving the impression the move would largely affect the jobless , he failed to mention it will also hit statutory maternity pay			1
at present , a mother is paid 90 per cent of her salary for the first six weeks of her maternity leave followed by £ 135.45 per week for the following 33 weeks			1
typically , the weekly amount is increased every april by the previous september ’s consumer prices index measure of inflation			2
this would have led to a 2.2 per cent rise , equal to around £ 3 a week			0
but under the new system , it will rise by only £ 1.35			0
@entity59 , @entity7 ’s spokesman on women , said : ‘ new mums are paying a heavy price for @entity11 ’s economic failure			1
this real terms cut in maternity pay is effectively a £ 180 @entity10 on working women – and it ’s bad for the whole family			1
’ a lower rate of maternity pay is likely to push some women back to work when they would prefer to be bonding with their infant			1
@entity7 predict maternity pay will be £ 180 lower for the 33 - week period in 2015 than it would have been			1
fathers will also be hit because the smaller annual rise will affect statutory paternity pay , which is paid for two consecutive weeks at the same rate as the mother receives			1
parents will also see a rise of just one per cent in their child benefit when the three - year freeze ends in 2014			0
since april 2011 , child benefit has been stuck at a rate of £ 20.30 per week for the first child and £ 13.40 per week for each subsequent child			0
video : chancellor introduces controversial ' mummy tax ' in @entity12 for parents with one child , this is the equivalent of an extra 20p a week – the average price of a nappy			0
@entity95 , chief executive of @entity96 , said : ‘ despite all the talk , working families are once again at the front of the queue for spending cuts			0
’ overall , @entity7 says women are picking up the bill for £ 867million of the £ 1billion of new direct tax , tax credit and benefit changes in the @entity12			0
other cuts to hit families since the @entity109 came to power in 2010 include the loss of the £ 250 child trust fund voucher , which used to be paid to all babies , and a £ 190 health in pregnancy grant designed to help women keep fit and eat well			1
mr @entity11 used his @entity12 yesterday to announce he was scrapping the link between working age benefits and inflation , after welfare handouts rose by twice the rate of average wages			1
in the @entity123 he emphasised the need to target the jobless , saying he had to be ' fair to the person who leaves home every morning to go out to work and sees their neighbour still asleep , living a life on benefits '			1
but the one per cent rise will also hit several benefits received by people in work , including income support and housing benefit			1
both maternity and paternity pay will be subject to a below inflation rise for three years from next april			1
some of the 232,000 women who claim maternity pay every year will be hit , along with 59,000 who claim @entity145 instead			1
tough cuts : child benefit , maternity and paternity pay will rise below inflation for the next three years , chancellor @entity11 announced details of the effective cut were sneaked out in the small print of the @entity12			1
statutory maternity pay is paid by employers when women take time off to have a baby			1
it is paid for 39 weeks , with the first six weeks at 90 per cent of usual salary and then 33 weeks at £ 135.45 a week			0
from april , the amount will increase by just £ 1.35 a week rather than the index - linked rate of around £ 3			1
the same rate is paid under @entity145 , which is awarded to those who do not qualify for statutory maternity pay – often nannies and those who are pregnant when they take a new job			1
expectant mothers can claim the allowance as soon as they have been pregnant for 26 weeks			0
@entity171 spokesman @entity170 said : ‘ in the @entity173 the small print was the granny tax and in the @entity12 the hidden detail was @entity11 ’s mummy tax			1
‘ they are hitting millions of working families and mums taking a break from their job to look after their newborn baby			0
and all on the same day that millionaires get an average tax cut of over £ 100,000			0
’ yesterday the chancellor said the long freeze will end in two years ’ time , but he will reward families with a rise of only 1 per cent for the following two years			0
autumn statement : mr @entity11 admitted higher government borrowing and lower - than - expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year , to 2018 for the second child , the rise is equal to just 13p a week			1
@entity11 ’s decision was criticised by experts who said the paltry increase will hurt families at a time when millions are struggling to make ends meet			1
child benefit , typically paid to the mother , is relied upon by families to balance their stretched budget , from helping to pay for their weekly food shop to buying a child ’s new shoes			1
until the @entity109 came to power in may 2010 , it used to increased generously each year , with the rise linked to the retail prices index measure of inflation			0
but the three - year freeze followed by two years of tiny rises has wiped out the spending power of child benefit , leaving a black hole in the family budget			0
some elements of the complicated child tax credit payments will also rise by only 1 per cent for three years from april 2013			0
a spokesman for the @entity226 said : ‘ family budgets have been put under extreme strain in recent years			0
stagnant wages and rising living costs are pushing more families towards financial breaking point			0
‘ the changes to child benefit will hit many families at a point when they are already struggling to make ends meet			1
’ child benefit , which used to be paid to every family with young children in @entity241 , has already become embroiled in controversy			0
from january 7 , families with at least one parent earning more than £ 50,000 will lose some of the benefit			0
it is being axed completely for those with at least one earner on more than £ 60,000			0
around 1.2million families will be affected by the move , but yesterday ’s announcement by the chancellor means those families who still get child benefit are now under attack as well			0
@entity256 , general secretary of the @entity257 , said : ‘ this chancellor has presided over one of the biggest ever squeezes on the budgets of working families			0
‘ small gains on fuel and the personal allowance are dwarfed by the swingeing cuts to child benefit and tax credits that many millions of families rely on to get by			0
for all the @entity270 talk of fiscal rules and structural deficits , it is money at home that matters to families , and that ’s where they ’ve been hit harder than anyone else			2
’ @entity280 , technical director of the @entity281 , described the rise as ‘ not generous ’ .			0

@entity11 revealed plans to limit increase in benefits to just *1pc*
but @entity252 failed to mention it will hit statutory maternity pay
