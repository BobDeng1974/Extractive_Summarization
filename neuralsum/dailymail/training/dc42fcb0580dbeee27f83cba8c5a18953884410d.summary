by @entity0 it 's not often @entity2 and fiance @entity4 team up with @entity5 and @entity7 's @entity6			2
but these famous faces all appeared in a video made by romantic @entity10 , 27 , from @entity11 , to propose to his girlfriend			1
@entity10 asked the celebrities to cameo in the video he made for girlfriend , @entity16 , 26 , in which he popped the question			1
not all of the big names were able to take part though , so sadly ' @entity5 ' was actually just a friend donning a mask but the rest all appeared			1
in the video , @entity6 says to the camera ; ' @entity16 , @entity10 loves you and wants you to marry him ! ’ it then cuts to @entity2 in his car , who rather amusingly fluffs his first attempt at a well - wish			1
he says : ' @entity47 , i ’m @entity2 and i ’ve met your fiancé			2
wait , let ’s go again			2
' the former @entity52 star then nailed the sweet message , saying : ' @entity16 , i ’m @entity2 , and i ’ve just met @entity10 , and you should definitely say yes because he ’s a top geezer			2
' next up is @entity4 , pictured sitting down on the floor , dressed down in jeans and a black vest			0
proposal number two ! former @entity52 star @entity2 and fiance , actress @entity4 , appeared in a proposal video by @entity24 from @entity11 @entity63 actress @entity4 , left , and former @entity52 star @entity2 , right , both appeared in @entity10 's video her message is short but sweet : ‘ please say yes @entity16 ! ’ the video then cuts to @entity10 himself , with perhaps the most affectionate message of all			1
' @entity16 , please give me a yes and make me the happiest man alive , i love you , ’ he says , before blowing a kiss to the camera			0
the couple had been together three years before @entity10 decided to compile the video of friends , family and celebrities for his big gesture on @entity83			1
he finally picked the secluded spot in @entity26 for its great views of @entity86 to ask the big question			1
lucky for him , @entity16 said yes straight away			0
star power : @entity6 , aka , @entity6 , from the tv show @entity7 , pictured here , made a cameo in @entity24 's proposal video , too write caption here the happy couple : @entity10 ( @entity25 ) proposed to girlfriend @entity16 and @entity10 ) in @entity26 and roped in a host of celebrities to help him ' it ’s all just been crazy and overwhelming , ' said teacher @entity10 ' but we ’re so happy together			1
after i had asked her and before she answered i said , " wait - watch this " and i played her the video on my phone			1
' she loved it as they were all our favourite celebrities and she started crying as she watched			1
' we were big fans of @entity7 and @entity16 loved @entity6 ’s personality so it was great when she agreed to do the video			2
' not the real @entity5 ! a friend dons a comical mask of the @entity112 star 's face , encouraging @entity16 to say yes to @entity10 's proposal , whilst @entity10 explains that even though he deliberately picked a quiet spot , one passerby guessed that they 'd just got engaged			0
