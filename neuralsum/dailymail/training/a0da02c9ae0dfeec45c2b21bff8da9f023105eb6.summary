@entity1 star @entity0 today revealed she could switch to supporting @entity2 in the wake of two shock defections by @entity6 mps			1
speaking at an event at the @entity6 in @entity8 , miss @entity0 , who found fame as @entity0 on the controversial show , hit out at the way the government had sought to impose sanctions on benefit claims			1
she condemned work and pensions secretary @entity16 for being ' out of touch with the real world ' and demanded greater job variety ' because not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall '			1
he has had a few extra members joining recently , has n't he ? ' at the weekend @entity6 mp @entity37 announced he was defecting to @entity2 , following @entity38 who jumped ship in august			1
miss @entity0 said she ' very well could ' vote @entity2 at the election , and told the audience she was ' not a massive fan ' of @entity44 leader @entity43			1
asked about benefit cuts , ms @entity0 criticised mr @entity16 , who has overseen the government 's welfare reforms			1
' you have someone who i think is completely out of touch with the real world making decisions on people who do actually live in the real world ... that 's @entity16 , is n't it ? ' ms @entity0 told the audience that job centres ' have to get more in touch with the real person '			1
' i have experienced some not very nice job centres , ' she said			1
' you do just go in , you sit down , you are looked down upon			0
' they just need to understand that , just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person			0
just because you are on benefits does n't mean that you are not physically looking for a job			2
' asked about the welfare changes introduced since 2010 , she said : ' i have noticed a change			0
i think it 's considerably got worse			0
' @entity1 star @entity0 told @entity6 activists that @entity16 is out of touch and jobcentres offer the wrong sorts of jobs she addressed the packed @entity28 event on : ' what more needs to be done to help people into work ? ' she criticised the way sanctions were applied to people for failing to fulfil their obligations under the system			1
' i think people are too quick to sanction people who are looking for jobs			2
you do have to deal with it on an individual basis , ' she said			0
' there are people out there who are very happy to sit at home and receive their benefits and not physically look for a job			2
but i know people who apply for 20 , 30 jobs a week			2
' you ca n't force an employer to give you a job , so what you have to do is make sure the resources are there to enable the jobseeker to get a job , be a bit more realistic with what kind of schemes are available to them , because not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall			1
' she added : ' it 's not fair that someone works a 40 - hour , if not more , week and does n't have as much to live on as someone who sits at home , does n't work and is given money from the government			0
' but that 's not that individual 's fault , that is the government 's fault			0
i think the @entity123 also has to look at ( the ) minimum wage and things like that			0
' it 's the government that says how much someone is entitled to to live on , not the individual			0
' miss @entity0 said jobcentres have to be realistic about the roles they offer , because ' not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall ' @entity38 became the first conservative to defect to @entity2 last month , sparking speculation that up to eight @entity138 were considering leaving the party ms @entity0 has hinted in the past that she would consider running for @entity141 , and told the gathering in @entity8 : ' it 's something i would think about , but obviously i would n't object to starting at the bottom - i would n't want to go straight in and have @entity146 's job			1
' i would think about it because i am interested in politics and i am interested in normal people and i am interested in the country			0
' she said she would form her own party if she decided to stand and dismissed criticism of her background , saying : ' just because you are a little bit common does n't mean that you are stupid and you would n't be able to have a good input			0
i think the more common you are the more in touch you are with real people , so yes it would be something i would consider			2
' she added : ' you can never be liked by 100 per cent of people , i think most mps know that			0
