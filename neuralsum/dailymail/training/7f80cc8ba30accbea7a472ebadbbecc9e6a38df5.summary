his 6ft by 1inch frame is so large that he does not even fit on his standard issue metal bed			1
and gone are his @entity11 nutritional consultants to ensure he is eating the right food - in their place are unhealthy muffins , grits for breakfast and burritos for dinner			1
inside his prison cell - which he has to keep neat at all times - is the metal bed with thin mattress , a pillow and a blanket , a combined toilet and sink with a seat that does n’t fit and a small metal desk with a stool attached to it			1

inside the cell : county sheriff @entity121 inspects a 7x10 - foot cell in the @entity78 , which is the same sized cell that @entity7 is now living in exercise cages : there are several exercise cages in the courtyard of the @entity78 - this is where @entity7 gets to spend one hour a day outside to do pushups life of luxury : the former $ 1.3m house of @entity11 football player @entity7 is pictured in @entity133 , @entity79 behind bars : the former @entity11 star is adjusting to life in the @entity78 in @entity79 ( pictured ) ‘ he ’d likely get a small muffin square and a choice between milk or juice			1

’ for an extra refreshment @entity7 has to bend his head down and slurp out of the tap in the sink			2
other meals include a cheese burrito with bread and rice or rice and beans with green beans			0
each day @entity7 is allowed to leave his cell three times for an hour each time			1
the morning hour is to take a shower in a small stall and make some collect phone calls			2

in jail @entity7 ’s former $ 40m contract is worth nothing - the maximum amount of money he is allowed to have in his commissary account is $ 80			1
and because of fears he will be murdered by a gang member looking to make a name for themselves , @entity7 has to be kept in a ‘ special management unit ’ - which is effectively solitary			1

@entity7 is also being investigated for having possible links to a separate double murder in @entity275 that left a third man wounded			2
his fall from grace has been all the more astonishing because he had been set for a bright future - @entity278 ’ $ 12.5m signing bonus to extend his contract to five years was the largest ever that an @entity3 tight end had received			2
the @entity282 reported that life inside the @entity78 is about as far removed from such privilege as you can get			0
