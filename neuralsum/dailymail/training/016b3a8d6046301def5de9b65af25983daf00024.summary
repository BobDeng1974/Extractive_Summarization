while @entity1 was forced to put his champagne on ice in @entity4 , @entity0 was seething in the rain in @entity6			2
for two rounds @entity0 had looked to be back to his best after a horrible year , with a lead at one stage of six shots at the @entity12			1
on saturday , he produced what he described as a ‘ c * * p ’ performance , shooting a three - over - par 75 that left him level with @entity17 and a shot behind @entity20 ’s @entity19 , who leads on 12 under			1
@entity0 described his third round three - over - par 75 at the @entity12 as ' c * * p ' @entity19 of @entity20 leads by a shot on 12 under par at the @entity12 in @entity25 @entity26 @entity17 is level on 11 under par alongside @entity28 team - mate @entity0 more relevant to @entity1 ’s interests is the fact that @entity0 ’s drop in pace allowed @entity33 back into contention , with the @entity35 also at 11 under par. that raises the possibility of @entity33 winning the storm - ravaged tournament on sunday , which would threaten @entity1 ’s coronation as the race to @entity4 champion			1
@entity33 remains one of only three players - along with @entity45 and @entity46 , who are respectively 10 and eight shots off the lead here - with a mathematical chance of stopping the @entity50 from winning his second race crown in three years			2
but to do so @entity33 needs to wins both this event and the season - ending tournament in @entity4 next week , where @entity1 would need to finish outside the top 17			2
@entity1 is currently practising in @entity4 ahead of his return to competitive golf after more than a month off , which has been spent preparing for the trial over his legal dispute with his former management company			0
@entity0 struggles during the third round of the @entity12 on @entity63 as he plays from the rough @entity64 of @entity26 is also in contention at the @entity12 on 10 under par after three rounds @entity0 ’s concerns were closer to home after a round containing three bogeys and a double at 15 when he miscalculated with a wedge and hit a tree			1
he has seemingly turned a corner after plummeting from 12th to 44th in the world rankings this year , but was furious about his performance			0
he said : ‘ it was c * * p. i ’m going to get my head down and do the job			2
it was really disappointing to be out of rhythm after playing such great golf			0
as good as it was for two days , this was as poor as it was and disappointing			0
‘ it ’s brought obviously a lot of players back into the fray			0
their dinner is going to taste lovely and mine is going to taste horrible			0
’ @entity17 , who shot a brilliant five - under - par 67 after his own struggles this season , said : ‘ i ’m just going to be enjoying being in contention really			1
it ’s been a while since i ’ve been up there , and i know what to do			0
just enjoy it and enjoy playing well again			0
’ @entity26 ’s @entity101 is at 10 under , while 48 - year - old @entity102 is in the frame at eight under			1
@entity26 's @entity104 ( left ) and @entity106 's @entity105 during their third rounds on saturday @entity35 's @entity108 looks on at one of his shots during his third round at the @entity12			1

@entity20 @entity19 leads @entity12 on 12 under
he is a shot clear of @entity26 *duo* of @entity0 and @entity17
@entity0 was furious with what he termed his ' c * * p ' third round in @entity25
he shot a three - over - par round of 75 on saturday to move off the pace
@entity26 's @entity101 is 10 under , with @entity102 on eight under
