a shocked traveller who was quoted a price of £ 23.7billion for a flight to @entity4 has been offered a € 40 voucher and an apology as a goodwill gesture from comparison website @entity9			1
@entity10 had searched for flights from @entity12 to @entity13 in the @entity14 when @entity9 returned the cheapest prices she could find for flights with @entity17 and @entity18			1
but having gone through to process of booking her flights ' without a hitch ' , @entity19 got a rude shock when the final price of £ 23,659,382,125.95 was offered			2
' what would have happened if i had ? neither of us has £ 23.7 billion to spare … what would have happened to my credit rating ? ! ! we might have had to up our rates for our holiday cottages by several million			0
' when @entity19 called @entity45 she could n't leave a message but her email query did get an automated response			0
' quickly an email appeared , urging me " do n’t miss out on your dream flight deal to @entity13 ( @entity52 ) ! we ’ve saved the flight to @entity13 you were searching for on @entity45			1
a second one reassured us , " we hope you find everything you ’re looking for on @entity45 "			0
' @entity9 has since made contact with sessions and attempted to make amends with the baffled customer , who runs two romantic holiday cottages in the @entity63 village of @entity64 , taking it all in good spirit			1
folk dancers perform in the square in @entity13 , @entity4 , where @entity19 aimed to fly from @entity4 ' we have now received an apology of sorts from @entity45 , who assure us in what looks horribly like an automated email that the " price issue detected has been solved "			2
one would hope so , too ! ' she said in a subsequent blog post			0
' they have offered us an " @entity80 for the value of € 40 as a commercial gesture " against our next flight , but i do n’t think we ’ll bother trying again ! € 40 does seem quite modest compared with £ 23.7bn but we appreciate the gesture			1

' the serene setting of the marina and old city in @entity13 in the @entity14 in the south of @entity4 a statement from @entity9 said : ' @entity45 would like to apologise to mrs sessions for any inconvenience caused			1
