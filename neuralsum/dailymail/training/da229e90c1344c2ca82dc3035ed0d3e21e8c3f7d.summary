by @entity0 last updated at 4:56 am on 4th november 2011 @entity1 , 7 , who suffers from a rare form of dwarfism when you see @entity7 and @entity8 , you could be forgiven for thinking there is a big age gap between the two sisters			1
six - year - old @entity4 , after all , towers over her sibling			2
but @entity7 is actually a year older than @entity4			1
sadly , she suffers from a form of dwarfism , that is so rare there are just 30 cases in the world			1
it means strangers always think @entity7 is the youngest sister			1
she only weighs the same as an 18 - month - old toddler and her school uniform is for a child aged three			1
mrs @entity1 , 40 , a nanny , said : ‘ her condition was so rare it took doctors years to find out what was wrong with her			0
‘ she may be tiny but she has such a big heart			2
and she loves being small			0
she tells me that she does n’t want to be bigger			0
all good things come in small packages - and that 's what @entity7 is			1
’ when @entity7 was born , she was a normal weight for an average baby , weighing @entity39 , and she was the heaviest of the couple ’s three children			1
her older sister @entity43 , now nine , weighed in at a smaller @entity44 , and her younger sister @entity4 weighed @entity45 when she was born			1
but by the age of three months @entity7 was constantly being sick and had recurrent coughs and chest infections			1
mrs @entity1 , who lives with husband @entity49 , 41 , a civil servant , in @entity50 , said : ‘ we never thought there was anything wrong with @entity7 when she was born - she seemed just perfect			1
but then when she was just a few months old , she started being poorly all the time			0
she just seemed to pick up infections one after the other			0
’ when @entity7 was 11 months old , she suddenly started gasping for breath and the couple rushed her into hospital			1
she was placed on a ventilator and doctors discovered that her lungs were full of fluid			0
tests showed that she had an abnormal heart valve that was leaking directly into her lungs			2
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ she looked so frail lying there and we did n’t know what was wrong			0
she still weighed only @entity69 , and she ’d had her first birthday			2
we could n’t understand why she was only so tiny			0
the doctors thought at first that the leaking valve had caused problems with her digestive system which had restricted her growth			0
’ faith then underwent a nine - hour operation to replace her faulty heart valve with a mechanical one			1
the operation was a success , but as the months went by she still did n’t grow			0
from left : the @entity1 sisters @entity43 , 9 , @entity7 , 7			1
and @entity4 , 6 , at home in @entity50 mrs @entity1 said : ‘ people used to think she was so cute because she was so tiny , but by her second birthday , she was still no bigger than she had been at her first birthday			0
' she seemed too little			0
when her sister @entity4 reached her first birthday , she was the same size as @entity7			1
people used to think they were twins			0
’ @entity7 was referred to a genetics centre in @entity50 who found that she was producing growth hormones normally			1
all the tests for growth conditions were negative			0
when she started school at the age of four , the school had to fit extra steps in the classroom and she had a booster seat to be able to sit down for mealtimes			0
then doctors finally discovered an answer			0
tests showed that @entity7 had a condition called @entity109 , an incredibly rare form of dwarfism			1
it is caused by inherited genetic mutations which result in very short stature and abnormalities to the bones , joints , heart and skin			2
unlike many forms of dwarfism is does n’t cause shortened limbs - just a miniature frame			1
it can also cause abnormalities to the heart and an enlarged liver			2
it is often life - threatening , but sufferers can live in to adulthood			2
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ we were absolutely devastated when @entity7 was diagnosed			1
we had never even heard of this condition before			0
the chances of her having it were a staggering 200 million to one			2
‘ she had just been incredibly unlucky			0
’ @entity136 , pictured here with her husband @entity49 , said that they were both devastated when @entity7 was diagnosed with the rare form of dwarfism and they had never heard of the condition before the couple ’s other two children were tested for the condition and been given the all - clear , but there is no cure for @entity7 , who has been the subject of a medical journal in @entity50			1
she has had another two heart operations and her chest cavity is now struggling to hold her growing organs			2
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ she has been in hospital recently because she was struggling to breathe			0
her organs are getting squashed in her chest , so we do n’t know what the future holds for her			0
‘ but she is just taking one day at a time			0
she may be tiny , but she has the heart of a lion			1
she ’s so fearless and feisty - if she thinks her younger sister is being picked on , she ’ll stand up to anyone			2
' she ’s full of fun and says she wants to be a princess when she grows up			0
she ’s an absolute mini marvel and a real inspiration			1

*200million* - to - one chances of being born with this form of dwarfism
@entity7 weighed a *healthy* *8lb* at birth but now weighs the same as an 18 - month - old toddler
mother describes her as a ' mini marvel ' with the ' heart of a lion '
