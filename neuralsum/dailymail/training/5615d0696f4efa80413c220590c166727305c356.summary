by @entity0 the @entity1 has arrested six suspected @entity3 hackers accused of masterminding a global network of online fraudsters trading in stolen bank and credit card information			1
they were among 24 suspects snared yesterday following a painstaking two - year undercover sting spanning four continents , described as the biggest of its kind against financial cyber-crooks			1
' @entity15 ' targeted ' sophisticated , highly organised ' criminals , involved in selling stolen identities , credit cards , fake documents and sophisticated hacking software , the @entity1 said			1
agents said the sting began in june 2010 , when the @entity1 established an undercover ' carding forum ' , that mimicked those operated by criminals to buy and sell information			1
agents reeled the crooks in through the fake website , called ' @entity41 ' , with which they hoodwinked their targets into believing they were on the hunt for stolen information			2
instead , they eavesdropped on discussion threads and private messages , and tracked genuine thieves through their ip addresses after they logged on			2
credit card fraud : the arrests came after undercover @entity1 investigators set up a bogus website where fraudsters involved in carding schemes could buy and sell stolen information and programmes authorities from 30 different countries are believed to have been involved in the operation			1
agents were also able to notify the credit card providers of more than 411,000 compromised credit and debit cards , and 47 companies , government entities , and educational institutions that their networks had been breached			0

the alleged fraudsters , operating out of various countries in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , would have pocketed a further £ 131 million from debit and credit cards had they not been stopped , the @entity1 said			1
a total of 11 people were arrested in the @entity95 , while suspects were held in 12 other countries including the @entity3 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			1
all are accused of buying and selling hacking programs and stolen personal information online			2
one of those arrested in @entity95 , called @entity112 , who uses the name ' @entity114 ' , claimed to be a member of @entity116 , a group that has claimed credit for numerous recent online hack attacks			1
he was also a founder of @entity121 , a carding forum on the @entity123			2
officials said he had information for more than 50,000 credit cards			0
the @entity1 said it seized the web server for @entity128 , and seized the domain name of @entity130 , taking both sites offline			0
in a separate development , a security report tuesday said a wave of cyber attacks has likely stolen at least $ 80 million from bank accounts in @entity96			2
@entity138 @entity95 attorney @entity137 said : ' as the cyber threat grows more international , the response must be increasingly global and forceful			1
' the coordinated law enforcement actions taken by an unprecedented number of countries around the world demonstrate that hackers and fraudsters can not count on being able to prowl the internet in anonymity and with impunity , even across national boundaries			1
' clever computer criminals operating behind the supposed veil of the @entity123 are still subject to the long arm of the law			0
' between £ 48million and £ 1.6billion has been stolen from bank accounts in a massive cyber bank raid where fraudsters raided dozens of financial institutions around the world			1
the ‘ highly sophisticated ’ ring had bypassed physical chip and pin identification to siphon large amounts from high balance accounts , a study by global security firm @entity161 and bank secuity specialist @entity162 found			2
more than 60 firms have suffered from what it calls an ‘ insider level of understanding ’			0
the report says : ‘ with no human participation required , each attack moves quickly and scales neatly			0
‘ this operation combines an insider level of understanding of banking transaction systems			0
’ the criminals created a computer code which automatically finds a victim ’s highest value account			0
it then transfers money to a prepaid debit card which can then be drained quickly and anonymously			0
the ‘ malware ’ is so advanced that it can stay on the victim ’s computer to conceal the theft , altering the target ’s bank statement			0
the report said : ‘ if all of the attempted fraud campaigns were as successful as the @entity200 example we describe in this report , the total attempted fraud could be as high as 2billion euro ( £ 1.6bn )			2
