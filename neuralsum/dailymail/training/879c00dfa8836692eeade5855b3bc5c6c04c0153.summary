but baby @entity2 still came into the world by royal approval			2
yesterday her husband , prince @entity5 , revealed a hitherto unknown royal fact : that he and his future wife were delivered by the same gynaecologist - obstetrician - but in very different surroundings			1
the prince made his revelation on a visit to @entity12 in @entity13 , south @entity14 , where , by coincidence , the @entity1 was born to major @entity16 and his wife the @entity19 on july 17 1947			1
@entity2 , @entity1 , holds an ' i 'm a @entity21 ' bear as prince @entity5 looks on during an official visit to @entity23 the man believed to be responsible for her safe delivery was the @entity27 obstetrician , sir @entity24 , who also worked at @entity28			1
a year later - on november 14 1948 - @entity5 was delivered by the same eminent medical man but in the more rarefied surroundings of @entity31			1
' my darling wife was born here but amazingly we had the same gynaecologist and nurse , ' the prince told fascinated staff			2
the couple visited several parts of the hospital including its neo-natal unit where @entity2 cheered worried parents and their babies as she cooed and pulled funny faces			1
she was particularly taken with five - month - old @entity47 , who laughed and gurgled at the royal face - pulling			0
one mother said : ' @entity2 was fantastic			2
she had @entity47 in fits of giggles and was so good with him , pulling funny faces to make him laugh ' prince @entity5 and @entity2 arrive for an official visit to @entity23 the @entity1 speaks with @entity53 , 33 , and her baby daughter @entity54 , 11 weeks , as she visits the neo-natal intensive care ward at @entity23 to highlight the high standard of nursing training and the @entity28 's @entity58 mum @entity59 , 19 , said : ' @entity2 was fantastic			1
she had @entity47 in fits of giggles and was so good with him , pulling funny faces to make him laugh			1
' she 's a gran herself so she 's obviously good with babies			2
' @entity47 was born with a bowel defect ( gastroschisis ) last august and we 've been here in the unit ever since			2
' he 's got to have another operation soon to lengthen his bowel , and he 'll be here for a year , but the future looks bright			0
' before he left prince @entity5 told hospital staff : ' the work you do here is fantastic , particularly having seen the neonatal unit and elderly wing - ever more significant with our advancing age ! ' afterwards the @entity1 was able to see first - hand wash bags now handed to victims of rape and sexual assault that she helped to devise			1
the @entity5 and the @entity1 speak with @entity84 , 88			1
later , prince @entity5 , revealed a hitherto unknown royal fact : that he and his future wife were delivered by the same gynaecologist - obstetrician @entity2 came up with the idea after meeting victims and discussing what would make them feel ' more human ' after going through such a traumatic ordeal and subsequent forensic examinations			1
with the help of her private office and supporters she drummed up enough donations from companies including @entity98 , @entity99 , 2 true and @entity100 to make up 750 of the bags which are currently being handed to women – and men – seeking help from @entity106 rape crisis centres in @entity14			1
the programme will be trailed on a two - year trial basis , although there are hopes to expand the initiative			0
speaking about her idea the @entity1 said : ‘ when you are ill , the first thing that you want to do is wash your hair and clean your teeth			2
‘ it is a small something to make women and girls who go through such a terrible ordeal feel just a little bit human again			0
‘ we are starting in a small way but i hope that we will be able to expand the scheme			0
it wo n’t change what has happened but might offer a small crumb of comfort at what is a very difficult time			0
’ @entity131 was shown round @entity132 at @entity12 , which is one of three centres in @entity14 that help around 140 victims – including men and children – each month			1
most are brought in by police but a proportion refer themselves , often after years of abuse or sexual violence			0
@entity131 met several members of staff including a nurse , counsellors and a senior forensic practitioner who deal with the centre ’s clients			0
‘ it must be quite a daunting experience , ’ said the @entity1 as she discussed the courage victims often had to find to report their experiences			2
the couple visited several parts of the hospital including its neo-natal unit where @entity2 cheered worried parents and their babies as she cooed and pulled funny faces @entity131 was shown round @entity132 at @entity12 , which is one of three rape centres in @entity14 that help around 140 victims - including men and children - each month ‘ do a lot of people decided they do n’t want to take it [ reporting their assault ] further ? ‘ i think you all do a wonderful job , thank goodness for people like you			1
’ after being shown the wash bags which contained shampoo , conditioner , handcream , a flannel , bodywash , toothpaste and a toothbrush and mascara , she said : ‘ you ca n’t even change what happened but you can make the journey better			2
’ @entity183 , @entity184 , said : ‘ i ca n’t tell you what this initiative means both to us and our clients			0
it makes them feel worthy again			0
when you experience something like they have you have no self - esteem , no self - worth and experience a lot of self - doubt			0
many experience self - blame too			0
‘ to be given something like this , to enable you to wash and feel clean again and then take home , makes you feel valued			0
‘ a few years ago when i went round for donations to some of the big companies they either did n’t want to know or would only give us something if their name was branded on the side			0
@entity131 has made this happen			0
’ with the help of her private office and supporters she drummed up enough donations from companies including @entity98 , @entity99 , 2 true and @entity100 to make up 750 of the bags which are currently being handed to women - and men - seeking help from @entity106 rape crisis centres in @entity14			1
