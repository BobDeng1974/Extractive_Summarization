by @entity0 it seems fans of the cult film @entity3 were not the only ones fascinated by the renowned @entity5			1
queen @entity6 , who was on the throne when the battle took place , was so enthralled by the celebrated battle that she ordered lieutenant @entity11 , the commanding officer , to give her a written report of what happened			1
but , just like in the battle itself , lieutenant @entity11 went above and beyond his call of duty - and decided to draw the queen five sketches showing a blow - by - blow account of how the battle unfolded			1
lieutenant @entity11 - who later became a major - drew sketches to show @entity6 @entity6 a step - by - step account of the @entity23 , which took place in january 1879 lieutenant @entity11 , who was awarded a @entity25 after the @entity26 , for his part in defending @entity5 lieutenant @entity11 - who later became a major - also drew one landscape sketch , complete with a key , to give @entity6 @entity6 the full picture of what happened when @entity32 surrounded a @entity34 compound			1
now , those sketches have put been on display for the first time , as part of the treasures from the @entity40 at @entity41			0
in the drawings , the lieutenant tells @entity6 that the sketches are drawn ' chiefly from memory and therefore might not be quite correct '			2
but he said it would give a ' fairly accurate impression ' of the relative positions			0
in the sketches , @entity11 uses red dots to show where the @entity34 soldiers moved and black dots to represent the @entity54			1
he even includes gardens and bushes in the diagram , while showing in detail how the hospital - which , along with a supply depot , formed part of @entity5 - was destroyed by fire			2
he uses the caption : ' darkness - completely surrounded			0
' the battle , which became the subject of the movie @entity3 in 1964 , saw 150 soldiers fight off up to 4,000 @entity32			2
the film , which is still celebrated more 50 years after it was made , saw @entity70 play lieutenant @entity11 , while @entity71 played his right - hand man , lieutenant @entity73			1
the success of the hand - to - hand combat came just hours after the @entity54 achieved a resounding victory over the @entity34 troops during their first engagement at @entity80			2
but this time , when some of the @entity3 forces assaulted the @entity34 field station at @entity5 , @entity34 soldiers repelled the attack , despite being heavily outnumbered			1
the @entity54 eventually retreated after 351 of the men died and 500 were wounded			2
@entity5 was the base for @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89			0
lieutenant @entity11 , played in the 1964 @entity3 film by @entity70 , pictured above , brought the battle to life through his drawings the sketches from the battle , which was later document through the @entity3 film , pictured above , are now on display for the first time at @entity41 lieutenant @entity11 , the commander of @entity100 , @entity101 , found himself in charge of the men and , together with lieutenant @entity73 , led the men into battle			1
he was later awarded the @entity25 , praised for saving the lives of all but 17 of his men			0
he was one of an incredible 11 men given the award			0
the @entity26 began in the late 1870s , when the @entity111 presented an obstacle to @entity34 imperial ambitions in southern @entity114			0
acting largely on his own initiative , the @entity34 high commissioner presented the @entity117 with an ultimatum with which he could not comply , subsequently sending a force to invade @entity111			0
the exhibition , which includes dozens of other historic letters and pictures , opens today .			0
