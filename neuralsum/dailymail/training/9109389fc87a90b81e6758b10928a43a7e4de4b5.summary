@entity0 will be dropped by @entity1 for the must - win fifth one - day international against @entity4 as @entity5 returns as captain following his one - match over-rate ban			1
with @entity9 a shoo - in after his sparkling 90 at in @entity8 two days ago , @entity1 will omit @entity0 , whose two games so far have produced 27 , 0 and a dropped catch – to say nothing of his part in the run - out of @entity15 in @entity16			1
another option would have been to rest @entity18 for the match in the picturesque hill - country of @entity21 – so allowing him extra time to practise the ukulele he now carries around with him on tour			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity18 show off his skill on the ukulele @entity1 captain @entity5 playfully grabs the shirt of bowling coach @entity28 the two grapple in the heat of @entity21 - but wear a smile as they go at it during a light - hearted session @entity0 is set to be the man to miss out after scoring 27 and 0 in his two innings but , unlike @entity0 , @entity18 is regarded as a certainty for the starting xi at the @entity38 , and will be given as much match practice as possible here			1
among the bowlers , the disappointing @entity41 will be fortunate to squeeze out off - spinner @entity43 for a third successive match			2
if @entity43 ’s omission in @entity8 over the weekend suggested @entity1 had got into a muddle over their priorities , then they have no option here			2
it ’s win or bust as @entity1 have to take three victories from the final three matches to clinch an improbable 4 - 3 triumph			1
@entity18 , who played a vital part in @entity1 ’s lone win in @entity16 last week but has otherwise failed to build on a couple of promising starts , had no hesitation in toeing the party line			1
@entity18 , walking off the ground after nets , said @entity1 were n't bothered by @entity64 's return @entity18 and @entity9 play - fight during the practice session at the @entity21 ground ‘ there ’s no reason why we ca n’t , ’ he said			1
‘ i think we showed in every game at some point that we ’re capable of doing that			0
' now we have to put it into one complete performance			0
even the game we did win we were n’t at our best , which is promising			0
‘ but we do n’t want to talk about being promising all the time			0
now is the time for us to step up and start putting in performances			0
' this is a great opportunity for us to do it under pressure before a @entity38			0
’ the tour has taken an unexpected twist with the news that @entity64 , the off - spinner who was banned for chucking in july , could make a dramatic return in wednesday ’s fifth one - day international			1
@entity5 ( centre left ) and @entity90 ( centre right ) jump over @entity93 during a warm - up exercise @entity93 dives acrobatically as he tries to stop the ball in the field during training @entity64 – who also caused a stir in the summer with the @entity99 of @entity93 – has been cleared by the @entity100 to resume his career after reportedly removing the kink in his action			1
the spinner had originally been pencilled in to make his return during saturday ’s sixth match here , but a hamstring injury to left - arm spinner @entity108 at tuesday ’s practice session could speed up his inclusion			2
for a bowler whose basic off - break was being delivered with 40 degrees of elbow flex – 25 more than the legal limit – it is quite a comeback			0
‘ he ’s a tough character , ’ said @entity4 coach @entity118			0
‘ he ’ll be the same bowler , but maybe with a slightly different action			0
he ’s been working hard on his action and was very keen to get back to international cricket as soon as he could			2
’ @entity90 spins the ball out to the wing during a game of touch rugby asked about the incident with @entity93 , who was run out by @entity64 backing up too far at the non-striker ’s end during the one - day international at @entity130 , @entity118 rightly refused to budge an inch : ‘ the rules say he did nothing wrong , and i totally stick by that			2
’ @entity136 no 3 and part - time off - spinner @entity137 has also had his action cleared , but it is the transformation of @entity64 , from a bowler whose obvious kink so infuriated @entity1 to persona grata , that is sure to lend spice to the last two games here			1
while @entity1 were convinced during the summer of the illegality of his action – as well as outraged by the manner of @entity93 ’s dismissal in @entity149 – the @entity144 exploited the reporting of @entity64 to foster a them - and - us mentality that eventually helped them win their first @entity153 series in @entity1			1
on tuesday , @entity18 spoke diplomatically about the bowler 's potential return			2
‘ that would be great , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s a very good international player			0
if he comes back we ’ll just have to find a way of combatting him			0
’ @entity159 was suspended for an illegal bowling action this summer , but can now return @entity64 angered @entity1 in the summer by dismissing @entity93 backing up at the non-strikers end @entity4 's captain @entity162 plays football with his team - mates during a practice session in @entity166			1

@entity0 set to drop out of @entity1 side after scores of 27 and 0
@entity5 was banned in @entity8 but will be back on wednesday
@entity64 , banned in july for a suspect action , could play
@entity1 trail 3 - 1 in seven - match series , and must win on wednesday
