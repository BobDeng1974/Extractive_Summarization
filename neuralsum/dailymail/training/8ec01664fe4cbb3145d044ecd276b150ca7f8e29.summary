@entity0 is in a fight to face @entity2 at the @entity3 after having surgery on a knee injury on thursday			1
the @entity8 striker ’s participation in @entity9 was thrown into doubt when he was hurt during a training session with @entity12 in the capital @entity13 on thursday morning			1
initial fears were that he could be sidelined for months rather than weeks			0
@entity12 wasted no time sending @entity0 for an operation and he had the procedure late in the afternoon			1
stricken : @entity0 had to be wheeled out of hospital on thursday night after his operation in the spotlight : the @entity8 striker is mobbed by fans as he leaves the hospital shock : the news of @entity0 's injury came as a big surprise on thursday morning swarm : a large crowd gather around @entity0 as he leaves hospital in @entity13 after being operated on transport : journalists , photographers and fans surround the ambulance carrying @entity0 hordes of media and fans were gathered outside the @entity39 hospital as a hooded @entity0 was escorted through in a wheelchair			1
@entity12 team doctor @entity42 is due to hold a press conference on friday when he will provide an update on the injury and the success of the operation			2
@entity8 have been kept informed and are confident the treatment he is receiving is correct			1
there are no plans to send any club medical staff out to oversee his rehabilitation			0
although it is unlikely he will be ready to face @entity57 in @entity12 ’s @entity59 opener in @entity60 on june 14 , it is hoped he could face @entity2 in @entity61 five days later			1
a @entity12 @entity63 statement said : ‘ @entity0 after the normal warm - up felt an intense pain in his left knee			1
an mri scan confirmed partial lesion of the external meniscus			0
‘ he had an arthroscopy with a partial resection of the meniscus			0
his participation in the @entity3 is not ruled out			0
’ familiar face : @entity0 is still a chance to play against his @entity8 team - mates when @entity12 take on @entity2 media scrum : @entity78 wait outside the hospital where @entity0 was being treated on thursday the scene : a view of the facade of the @entity39 hospital where @entity0 was operated on it was also claimed @entity0 suffered the injury in the final game of the season , when he was tackled by @entity89 ’s @entity88			1
that led @entity12 fans to send online death threats to @entity88 , who was sent off for the challenge but later had the decision rescinded			0
@entity0 is upbeat about his prospects and before entering hospital told @entity98 newspaper : ‘ take it easy because i ’m going to make it ( to the @entity3 ) and will work very hard these days to be at 100 per cent and help out my team - mates			1
’ such is @entity0 ’s importance to @entity12 that local reporters even contacted his mother for a diagnosis			2
she informed them : ‘ everything went well			0
what @entity0 had was n’t as serious as we thought			2
he ’s going to play in the @entity3			0
’ year to remember : @entity0 scored an incredible 31 goals in 33 @entity111 games last season the thought of missing out on @entity9 would leave @entity0 distraught and @entity114 once gave an insight into the 27 - year - old ’s character , saying : ‘ he ’d play football all week , all day and night , if he could			2
he is a worker , a grafter and lives for football			0
’ had @entity0 suffered medial ligament damage , as was initially feared , he would have been looking at a lay - off of up to 16 weeks			2
that would have made him a doubt for the start of the new @entity111 campaign			0
former @entity8 striker @entity127 suffered meniscus damage during a @entity130 game in april 2010 before the @entity3 in @entity131			1
he managed to get himself fit within seven weeks but , arguably , the rush of getting himself back into contention took its toll .			0
