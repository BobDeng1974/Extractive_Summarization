the tablet is expected to go on sale later this year , and will go head to head with @entity11 's @entity10 , @entity13 's @entity12 and the @entity14 in the lucrative small tablet market			1
it is hoped the devices could reverse the disappointing sales of the larger surface tablet which @entity2 launched this year			1
the surface tablet was unveiled earlier this year to a lukewarm reception - now @entity2 is believed to be developing a smaller version to take on @entity11 's ipad mini @entity25 's new @entity24 has a 6.3 - inch hd screen - although the firm claims it is ' ultra-thin and portable enough to put into your pocket			1
' the @entity24 comes with an enhanced 8 megapixel rear - facing camera with a 1.9 megapixel front - facing camera , and runs @entity13 @entity35 software			1
' the software giant is developing a new lineup of its surface tablets , including a 7 - inch version expected to go into mass production later this year , ' , @entity36 said people familiar with the company 's plans had claimed			1
it claims the 7 - inch tablets were n't part of the company 's strategy last year , but @entity2 executives realized they needed a response to the rapidly growing popularity of smaller tablets like @entity13 7 - inch @entity12 , which was announced last summer , and the 7.9 - inch @entity10 introduced by @entity11 last october , along with @entity55 's @entity54			1
seperate reports have specualted the new tablet could be designed primarily as a games and media device , and be branded as an ' xbox tablet ' to accompany @entity2 's hugely successful games console			1
it comes amid growing concern for the future of the pc industry as consumers move towards tablets			2
pc sales have have gone into freefall with a 14 per cent drop last year - the biggest slump in history			2
@entity73 , the world 's largest pc maker , saw the sharpest decline with 24 per cent fewer machines sold in 2012 compared to 2011			0
@entity77 also saw an 11 per cent slump and even @entity11 , which saw a seven per cent fall , was unable to buck the trend			1
research firm @entity80 said it was the biggest decline overall since it began began tracking this data in 1994			0
analysts said that ‘ the days seem to be numbered for the humble pc ’ and that in the future we would all be using portable devices			0
even the launch of @entity89 failed to stop the trend with some saying the negative response to the software may have exacerbated the trend			0
pc makers have in recent years tried a string of innovations to breathe life into the market including @entity99 which were poorly received			0
how the competition stacks up experts say the success of the @entity10 and smartphone has led to the slump in pc sales , with people preferring gadgets they can carry with them @entity89 was also criticised for making too many changes and getting rid of the iconic start button			0
the figures show that the late @entity11 founder @entity112 ’ prediction that we are headed for a ‘ post-pc era ’ is coming true			1
@entity115 , program vice president for clients and displays at @entity80 , said that what he called the ‘ radical changes ’ made to the pc in recent years had done it more harm than good			0
he said : ‘ at this point , unfortunately , it seems clear that the @entity89 launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the pc market , but appears to have slowed the market			0
‘ @entity2 will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the pc market ’			0
@entity2 also came under fire for the slump , with critics saying its @entity89 software confused users some 350 million personal computers are sold each year , but the numbers are nothing compared to more portable options			0
some 919 million smartphones will be sold this year and 200 million tablets , taking their total comfortably over one billion			2
research firm @entity142 also released similar figures which showed a 11 per cent decline in pc sales , the biggest drop since 2001			2
the company has already predicted that by 2017 the main operating system for all computing devices will be @entity13 ’s @entity35			2
