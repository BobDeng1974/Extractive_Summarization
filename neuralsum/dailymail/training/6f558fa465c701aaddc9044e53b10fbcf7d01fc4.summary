as the the rubble of the @entity2 smouldered in @entity3 , president @entity0 authorised @entity4 in @entity5 , to hunt down and kill those responsible for the 9/11 attacks			2
by october 2001 , @entity9 and @entity10 servicemen began massing in @entity5 , transiting through the massive @entity11 in the north east of the country			1
at the height of operations , it had a population of more than 40,000 and was the air base was the busiest military airport in the world , supporting more than 140,000 operations in a single year - including the @entity23 mission to kill @entity24			1
a tented city at @entity11 which was once home to almost 40,000 people is being demolished as part of the @entity9 withdrawal thousands of tonnes of concrete barriers are being removed from the perimeter of the massive facility as it shrinks in size at its height , @entity11 air base supported more than 140,000 operations a year , including the mission to kill @entity39 leader @entity24 troops in @entity11 air base put up direction signs marking out their home locations such as @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity46 air bases now , however , the @entity9 are handing over control of @entity11 to @entity5 authorities and the size of the facility is being scaled down dramatically			1
almost 2,500 members of the @entity9 military died in @entity5 over the past 13 years along with more than 450 @entity10 forces or @entity55 civilians			1
a further 20,000 @entity9 troops have been wounded in action			2
president @entity58 has already announced the end of combat operations in @entity5 for @entity9 ground troops , although air support is still being offered			1
approximately 10,000 @entity64 ground troops will remain in the country to provide support to the @entity5 forces			1
the @entity9 withdrawal comes at a crucial time for @entity5 as the @entity70 has increased the intensity of its attacks on local forces			1
in its early days , @entity11 was used to interrogate @entity70 of @entity39 suspects before they were moved to @entity75 the massive airbase used its size as part of its security , with several layers of defence to prevent large - scale insurgent attacks concrete barriers were used inside the air base to create partitions to prevent an artillery strike causing widescale damage local security services face a massive task as they are losing approximately 100 men a week to terror strikes			1
today alone , at least nine people were killed across @entity5 , including two children who were struck by a bomb blast while gathering firewood , officials said			2
the fatal blast took place in the @entity100 district of the southern @entity102 province			0
a separate bomb blast in the @entity105 district of @entity102 wounded another 10 children , leaving seven in critical condition , said @entity108 , the spokesman for @entity102 's governor			0
@entity110 , father of one of the wounded children said : ' our children were there to collect wood to burn when they were hit by this bomb			0
the government should have cleared the area , it their duty to protect us			0
' @entity5 is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world , and children are often killed or wounded while playing , collecting firewood or tending animals			2
one of the most effective defences against rocket or mortar attack is the low - tech sandbag which absorbs the explosive force the temporary wooden structures are being demolished to reflect the size of the far smaller international security operation in @entity5 @entity9 engineers converted 40ft shipping containers into accommodation units , which are now going to be scrapped as part of the withdrawal the deaths of the two children brought the day 's toll across @entity5 to nine dead			1
in the eastern @entity148 province bordering @entity149 , a bomb blast killed judge @entity151 and wounded two of his daughters in the provincial capital @entity155 , police spokesman @entity145 said			0
the judge served in neighboring @entity157 province			0
in another attack , insurgents killed six people working on a road project , including the head of a construction company , in northern @entity156 , police spokesman @entity158 said , adding that the attack wounded another person and left two missing			0
in eastern @entity172 province , three suicide bombers attacked a police academy , with one blowing himself up in a car and the other two shot by police , the provincial governor 's office said in a statement			0
it said three police officers were wounded			0
the @entity70 claimed responsibility for the attacks in @entity148 and @entity172			0
@entity5 security forces are losing more than 100 men a week to @entity70 attacks , which have intensified with the @entity185 withdrawal the new shrunken airbase will hold approximately 13,000 @entity9 and international troops who will remain for two years to train local forces large areas of @entity11 airbase have been heavily mined since the days when it was controlled by the @entity192 @entity70 insurgents have stepped up attacks on @entity5 soldiers and police in recent months			1
@entity9 and @entity185 forces concluded their combat mission at the end of last year and @entity5 troops took charge from @entity202			1
@entity9 army major @entity203 is serving in eastern @entity5 where he is training local soldiers how to use heavy artillery , which could give them a crucial advantage over @entity70 forces			1
the training mission is due to continue for a further two years , although @entity5 president @entity209 has suggested that the @entity9 and @entity185 could look at 're - examining ' their 2016 withdrawal deadline			1
@entity212 spends most days at this dusty base surrounded by mountains in @entity157 province planning with @entity5 army counterparts how they should use d - 30 artillery			2
up until a few months ago , though , the @entity5 were n't using the 122 - mm long - range weapon as intended - to hit targets several kilometres away , too far to be seen by those firing			0
he said : ' they 've been using it sort of like a tank , for direct fire at enemies they could see			0
they are having more successes			0
' @entity212 said : ' they are having to get used to standing on their own			0
come back in a few months , and we 'll see where they are			0
' much of the debris from the scrapped accommodation units has been piled up in central locations for disposal the airbase is overlooked by the imposing @entity242 mountains which are still controlled by the @entity243 the number of @entity185 troops in the @entity246 in @entity5 peaked at more than 130,000 in 2011 before a gradual withdrawal began the following year			1
according to @entity246 , there were around 58,000 troops at the start of 2014 compared with some 13,000 now largely engaged in training			0
the @entity9 retains a counter-terrorism force that hunts @entity39 and other militant targets , along with its unmanned drone strikes and limited close air support for @entity5 troops under guidelines issued by president @entity58 allowing limited combat in 2015			1
mostly , though , the new mission named ' @entity260 ' is tasked with training , including building up systems like logistics , supply chains , planning and strategy for @entity5 forces			2
@entity5 's own security personnel are dying at a rate of about 100 per week , a level the @entity9 military has described as unsustainable , and foreign forces are advising them on how to reduce the rising casualty rate			2
by comparison , about 3,500 foreign soldiers have died in the @entity5 war since 2001 , including around 2,200 @entity9 .			2

@entity11 air base in @entity5 was once home to more than 40,000 people and supported 140,000 missions a year
in october 2001 the @entity9 and @entity185 troops began a massive *expansion* of the facility to support the war effort
now , the outer perimeter is being reduced to account for the withdrawal of *coalition* combat troops from the country
some 13,000 support troops will remain in @entity5 to train local security forces for a further two years
the @entity9 ceased combat operations in @entity5 on *january* 1 , although limited air support is still offered
