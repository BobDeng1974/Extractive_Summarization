a @entity5 @entity25 bomber takes off from @entity26 in @entity27 after the start of the @entity8 war in 2003 president @entity13 says he is prepared to take ' targeted and precise ' action in @entity8 , and up to 300 military advisers to help train and advise @entity8 forces will be deployed to the country			1
last week deputy pm @entity35 said the @entity3 would not stand in the way of action that is ‘ well - judged and well - targeted ’			1
more detail has now emerged about the type of support which could be provided			0
work and pensions secretary @entity41 ' we have got to do what we can ' to support the in any action it takes			2
in practice this is likely to mean supply and maintenance of aircraft , and could see @entity5 planes taking off from @entity3 bases mr @entity41 , @entity52 leader at the time of the @entity54 , said : ' we have to do what we can to support the @entity5			1
' the government has said it 's not going to be doing any airstrikes or putting soldiers into @entity8 but i think there are lots of other things we can do to help support them - make sure they get the right spare parts and support in maintaining those kind of aircraft and equipment and also support the @entity5 where they need it in terms of supply , et cetera			1
' work and pensions secretary @entity41 said @entity3 will ' do what we can ' to support the @entity5 asked if @entity3 bases could be used , mr @entity41 pointed out that an ' awful lot of @entity8 ' was not being run by @entity15 , indicating that bases in that country could be used			1
but he added : ' the government 's position has been quite clearly that we will do what we can to support what the @entity5 want to do in terms of this			2
we are not going to be , as i understand it , joining them			0
' but what we will be doing is helping the @entity8 government and helping the @entity5 to stabilise the situation			2
' we should be in no doubt that @entity15 are a really nasty , brutal operation			0
we have seen some of the dreadful pictures of what they have been doing in the cities and towns that they control			0
' the @entity100 reported that there was a split within the government over how much support the @entity3 should be prepared to offer mr @entity13 if he does decide to launch airstrikes			1
militants from @entity107 ( pictured ) seized four more towns in @entity8 yesterday while @entity110 soldiers marched through @entity111 as the country heads towards sectarian warfare ( file pic ) @entity15 now controls a swathe of territory across @entity8 and @entity117 ( shown in red			0
) yesterday they captured @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , bringing them within striking distance of the @entity126 ( left )			0
meanwhile government forces have been amassing in @entity111 ( right ) the newspaper said opposition to providing support for the airstrikes was led by veteran @entity52 minister @entity132 , backed by @entity134 minister @entity133 , commons leader @entity135 and @entity137 ministers			0
the report said defence secretary @entity139 told the cabinet @entity3 should keep open the option of backing @entity5 airstrikes and in the @entity143 made clear he thinks the @entity3 should ' absolutely be doing anything the @entity5 asks '			2
the chancellor @entity145 warned the @entity18 that @entity3 's interests are at stake because the conflict could drive up oil prices - an intervention seen by his colleagues as evidence that he wants all options on the table			0
their position is supported by @entity158 , the education secretary , and @entity160 , the culture secretary , the newspaper reported			0
mr @entity41 said : ' if @entity15 was to eventually take over @entity8 that could cause complete chaos in the @entity163 , that would affect us even indirectly in terms of the cost of running our country , the @entity168 would suffer dramatically , that 's the shallowest part of it			1
' the reality is it 's a very dangerous situation			0

@entity3 will not take part in military action but offers @entity13 logistical support
