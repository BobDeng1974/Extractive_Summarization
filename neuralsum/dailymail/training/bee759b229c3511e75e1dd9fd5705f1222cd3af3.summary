more than half of @entity4 's mp candidates in winnable seats for the general election have already worked in politics , new research has found			1
the party has stuffed its hit list of potential new mps with former special advisers , party workers and lobbyists - compared to just 17 per cent of conservative candidates with political backgrounds , and 46 per cent of @entity16			1
it will fuel concerns about the development of a ' political class ' of people who have never worked in real world jobs , which the public repeatedly say in polls turns them off voting			1
@entity25 , the son of former @entity4 minister @entity26 , ran a blog before he was selected as a candidate @entity29 , the former cabinet minister who is carrying out a review into how @entity4 can win back voters , said the fact that people think politics is ' reproducing itself ' is a growing source of discontent			1
mr @entity29 , @entity4 mp for @entity38 who is standing down next year , added : ' it is not the only factor but it means political parties are getting more distant from their electorate than they used to be			1
' i think disconnection is so bad now that the old politics is in a terminal state			2
i think you can explain a lot of @entity51 's rise and the anti-politics mood around that disconnection			0
' the research - compiled by @entity55 - emerged as @entity56 , the @entity4 leader , and @entity58 are currently the least popular they have ever been , according to a @entity55 / @entity61 poll			0
' just 22 per cent of people think mr @entity56 is doing a good job while 61 per cent thinking he is doing a bad job , his lowest rating since 2010			2
' in a study of 177 candidates standing in marginal seats , those which could change hands with just a 5 per cent swing in votes , or those where the sitting mp is retiring , over half of the 90 @entity4 candidates have already worked in politics			1
one of the so - called ' @entity77 ' , @entity78 , son of former leader @entity80 , with his wife @entity81 ' fifteen are ex-mps standing again having been ousted by the electorate , some of their expenses such as @entity86 and @entity87			0
others are current or former staff of @entity56 , @entity90 and ex-ministers			0
' @entity92 , 31 , who is standing in @entity93 and @entity94 , where @entity95 is standing down , has been a policy adviser to @entity96 and worked on @entity56 's leadership campaign			0
' candidates standing for @entity4 next year also include the so - called ' @entity77 ' whose fathers were in politics â€“ @entity78 , son of former leader @entity80 , @entity25 , son of former foreign secretary @entity26 , who works for a think tank			1
it is widely speculated that @entity104 's son @entity103 , 30 , could stand in @entity105 , @entity106 where 80 - year - old mp @entity107 is standing down			0
former @entity4 minister @entity29 said the fact that people think politics is ' reproducing itself ' is a growing source of discontent only 17 per cent of conservative candidates in their 52 winnable seats have political backgrounds , as many come from business , the law and the military			1
but they are overwhelming male ( 68 per cent ) while @entity4 's are 56 per cent women			0
the @entity16 candidates are 43 per cent women			2
fifteen out of 35 @entity16 selected in the most winnable seats have links to @entity126 or @entity127 politics			0
dr @entity129 , of @entity130 , said over the last 20 or 30 years @entity4 ' increasingly seem to be picking people who have been political workers			1
' dr @entity129 said : in ' you ca n't underestimate the symbolic importance of who is in power because people will take their cues about what politics is about and like from what they see			2
if you see a lot of people who have nothing to do with your day - to - day life , you 're going to begin to think politics is n't necessarily something for people like you			2
' few candidates from any party come from non-professional jobs , with some exceptions being @entity154 , a former retail worker in @entity156 for @entity4 , and @entity157 , a postman standing for the conservatives in @entity159			0
@entity160 , the shadow equalities minister said @entity4 has a @entity162 programme which helps give people from non-political backgrounds the skills to run for selection			2
but she added there is ' always more we can do '			0
' lots of people who are drawn to the @entity4 are incredibly passionate about the causes that we fight for , and it 's therefore no surprise that many of them want to work for the party or in other campaigning roles before running for office			0
that includes lots of people like myself from ordinary , working - class backgrounds ' , she said .			1

just 17 *%* of conservative candidates with political backgrounds
it will fuel concerns about the development of a ' political class '
@entity29 said people think politics is ' reproducing itself '
