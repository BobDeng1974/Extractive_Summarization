the two - year - old bulldog even disciplines the lion and the tiger when their play fights get out of hand			1
the three animals live together with former vet assistant , 26 - year - old @entity14 , who is hand rearing the cubs			0
‘ when she was about five or six weeks old she was able to hold her ground and we started to let them interact on a regular basis and they have been good friends ever since			0
‘ @entity3 is a bit of an odd baby and mostly does his own thing but they also play together			2
@entity1 will stalk him and then jump on him			2
’ 26 - year - old @entity14 , has hand reared several litters of lion cubs like @entity3 as well as baby tigers the young cubs stay at @entity49 during the day and live with @entity27 and her dog @entity1 in the evenings the young cubs spend their days at @entity49 in @entity25 , @entity26 , before returning to the nearby house in the evenings			1
the bizarre relationship between father - figure @entity1 and his adopted children has grown overtime thanks to regular family outings to go walking and swimming			2
sometimes @entity3 will drag @entity1 by his lead - but like the any good father makes sure to assert his authority			1
‘ at this point @entity1 can still bully them around , ’ said @entity63 , a former vet assistant from @entity64			2
‘ but in about a month 's time they will definitely be bigger than him - so we will have to see how much of a bully they turn out to be			0
’ miss @entity14 , who moved to @entity26 to follow her dream of working with wildlife , has previously hand - reared eight tiger cubs and several litters of lion cubs			0
the cubs are bottle fed three times a day and eat ribs now but when they grow up they will eat horse legs @entity83 bulldog @entity1 has taken on a fatherly role with white lion @entity6 the tiger and disciplines them at times the cubs ' owner @entity14 said if the pups start to see @entity1 as prey they will have to be kept apart from him the cubs have been home - reared to help them safely interact with park vets when they are older and bigger			1
@entity3 and ice weigh two - and - a - half stone now but @entity3 will eventually tip the scales at 28 - stone and ice at almost 40 - stone			2
they are rapidly growing and are fed on a diet of ribs and bottle feeds three times a day			0
when fully grown they will be fed a horse leg once or twice a week			0
meanwhile the biggest @entity1 will grow is seven stone			1
this huge weight difference means that despite their bond @entity1 may one day have be separated from his adopted pups			1
miss @entity14 added : ‘ there have been times when big cats kept their relationship with pets as full - grown animals but we will have to see how this goes			0
‘ if they get along and they are still friends that is fine			0
‘ but if they start seeing @entity1 as prey - then we will have to stop the interaction between them			0
’ igor the white lion will weigh around 28 stone when he is fully grown and will live cease to be bottle fed the three animals have formed a friendship with @entity83 bulldog @entity1 taking on a fatherly role oveer white lion cub @entity3 and white tiger cub ice			1
