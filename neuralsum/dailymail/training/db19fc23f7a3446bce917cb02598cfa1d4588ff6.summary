by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 08:02 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 17:35 est , 14 march 2013 he is clearly keen to find a way to spice up his stodgy public image			0
but having a ‘ @entity7 moment ’ was perhaps not what @entity8 had in mind			1
the @entity12 leader was photographed yesterday taking the @entity13 , just as former @entity14 miss @entity7 had been the day before			1
mr @entity8 – fresh from being labelled a champagne socialist during prime minister ’s questions 24 hours earlier – was on the tube with @entity12 mp dame @entity18			1
smiles : @entity8 shared a joke with a passenger and dame @entity18 , left , during the journey on the tube spooked : labour leader @entity8 looks uncomfortable as he takes the tube back to @entity24 after delivering a speech on banking the pair were returning to @entity24 following a meeting with business owners in @entity30 , south @entity13 , where they were joined by @entity12 ’s business spokesman @entity31			1
mr @entity8 and @entity32 were seen laughing and joking with commuters who appeared pleased , if a little surprised , to see him in their midst			0
slumming it : @entity7 took the tube yesterday and expressed her excitement on @entity37 the @entity12 leader did his best to look nonchalant – and at least he stayed awake , unlike his elder brother @entity39 , who was caught out by fellow passengers in january when he fell asleep on the tube with his flies open			1
but @entity13 photo - opportunities are not without their peril , as @entity44 found			0
she faced a @entity37 backlash after she stunned commuters by tweeting her top tips for taking the underground – following her first @entity13 trip in 17 years , a journey that lasted all of one stop			0
earlier he used a speech to business leaders to set out a plan for a new network of lenders which would only funnel money to people and businesses in their area			1
he said up to 20 new regional banks would be created by a @entity12 government to herald a return to old - fashioned local lending			1
he attacked high street banking giants who too often say ' no ' to customers , and promised new ' banks you can come to trust '			1
but banking groups said they had already increased the number of local bank managers taking decisions on lending to business			2
lending to small firms has collapsed in recent months , leading critics to accuse the big taxpayer funded banks of ‘ stabbing businesses in the back ’			1
@entity84 figures last month revealed net lending - the amount banks lend compared to money repaid by customers - was negative at minus £ 1.5billion			1
smart casual : mr @entity8 tries to look relaxed but risks the doors banging him on the head chewing things over : mr @entity8 was joined by shadow business secretary @entity31 and local mp @entity18 to meet diners in @entity94 in south @entity13 today this is despite the launch of an £ 80billion scheme by the @entity84 and the @entity98 last august aimed specifically at solving the country ’s small business and mortgage lending crisis			1
the @entity103 ’s ‘ make the @entity104 ’ campaign was launched in july 2010 to highlight the problems facing small businesses			0
@entity12 say the regional banks would leverage private sector funding but may also require an injection of public money			1
they are provisionally called ‘ @entity113 ’ - as they are modelled on regional banks in @entity112 called sparkassen			1
awkward : mr @entity8 did not look comfortable as he left a cafe in @entity30 hats off : the @entity12 leader toured shops and met market stall holders to discuss his plans for new local banks mr @entity8 told to the @entity121 : ‘ the regional banks being proposed will be committed to their regions and in touch with local business , making it easier for firms to secure the capital investment they need so they can create the jobs and growth @entity131 needs			1
’ he said he had heard from countless businesses refused legitimate finance by ' banks that do n't know your businesses or who do n't seem to care '			2
' nothing the government has done has made a difference			0
net lending fell by £ 4.5 billion in the last quarter while the big banks carry on with a bonus as usual culture			1
' it is time to recognise that tinkering will not sort this out			0
@entity131 needs a wholly new banking system			0
' however , today @entity150 leader @entity149 accused @entity12 of letting the banks ' get away with blue murder ' before the 2008 financial crash			1
he told @entity154 : ' it was @entity150 who week in , week out said to @entity157 and @entity158 “ do n’t go off on your prawn cocktail charm offensive in the @entity161			0
” ' which was what @entity158 was doing at the time ; basically sucking up to the banks and letting them get away with all that nonsense			2
' they left the cupboard bare , they let the banks run amuck and i find it quite remarkable how little contrition we hear from @entity158 and @entity8 , they still have n’t acknowledged their responsibility in creating the mess in the first place			0
mr @entity8 said next week 's budget had to focus on helping firms to succeed @entity12 already had plans to create a @entity131 @entity182 , but mr @entity8 said he would go further			2
' we do n't just need a single @entity182 serving the country			0
we need a regional banking system , serving each and every region of the country			0
' regional banks with a mission to serve that region and that region alone			1
not banks that like to say ' no ' , but banks that know your region and your business			0
not banks that you mistrust , but banks you can come to trust			2
' i am committed to turning that idea into reality during the next government because i am determined that @entity12 becomes the party of the small business and the entrepreneur as together we create a recovery made by the many and built to last			2
' @entity208 , a @entity150 peer who resigned in 2011 after criticising @entity211 - a previous @entity213 attempt to help small firms - gave the scheme a cautious welcome			0
mr @entity8 wants to see a return to ' old fashioned ' bank managers , like @entity219 in @entity221 's @entity220 he said yesterday : ‘ all ideas to make banks lend are welcome and this is a sensible idea to increase long term lending			2
‘ but it will take a long time to build a network of regional banks and the key challenge in the short - term is how to make the state - owned banks @entity232 and @entity233 lend as they represent 60 per cent of the market and they are failing the nation			1
that is now the biggest challenge facing the government			0
’ the @entity240 said regional banks had been proposed before and they had to examine the details to see if they could work in @entity131			1
mr @entity8 said small and medium sized firms ‘ are the backbone of the @entity131 economy ’ but keep being turned down for lending			0
the new banks would be regional partners in a @entity131 @entity182 which is already underway			2
he will also outline the need for infrastructure projects such as a airports and railways			0
addressing next week 's @entity253 , mr @entity8 added : ' you 've been telling us for so long that the way we resource and plan our infrastructure in @entity131 is not good enough			0
' that 's why , when our construction sector is still flat on its back , @entity12 would be advancing investment in infrastructure			2
' he aid the @entity253 needed to ' raise our sights to the big challenges that our country has faced for decades '			0
' to succeed , we do n't just need immediate measures : we need to build new institutions out of the rubble of the old with radical new approaches to banking , skills , the @entity131 firm and infrastructure , underpinned by confidence and clarity about our place in the world			0
