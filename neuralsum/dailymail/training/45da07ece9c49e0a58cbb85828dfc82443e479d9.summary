@entity32 , chief secretary to the treasury , said @entity0 was in ' pole position '			2
however , both the @entity3 and @entity0 economies slowed at the end of last year and @entity3 is expected to overtake @entity0 this year			1

@entity48 , chief @entity0 economist at @entity49 , said : ' the underlying story is one of the @entity0 gradually consigning the financial crisis to history			0

the official statistics agency @entity88 said yesterday that inflation across the region fell from -0.2 per cent in december to a joint record low of -0.6 per cent in january			0

crude has dropped below $ 49 a barrel , compared with $ 115 last summer , cutting the price of essentials from petrol to heating			0
