by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:29 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 07:42 est , 8 january 2014 immigrants from @entity6 and @entity7 could contribute more to @entity8 than ‘ natives ’ , a @entity4 minister has suggested			1
@entity11 @entity10 backed claims in the @entity13 that ‘ hard - working @entity6 and @entity7 ’ would pay more in tax than they claim in benefits and public services , as earlier @entity18 migrants had done			1
and he added that the government is ‘ very happy ’ about the free movement of people across the @entity18 after work restrictions were lifted on january 1			1
@entity11 home office minister @entity10 ( left ) backed claims from @entity25 's @entity24 that @entity6 and @entity7 would bring net benefits to @entity8 amid rising public anxiety before @entity29 , mr @entity27 announced @entity18 migrants will have to wait for at least three months before they can claim any out - of - work benefits under emergency regulations which took effect from january 1			1
@entity18 migrants had been able to start claiming jobseeker ’s allowance and other benefits within weeks of arriving – prompting concern that some people are arriving , signing on and only then looking for work			2
but @entity25 peer @entity24 , who was a defence minister in @entity41 ’s government , pointed to a study which suggested immigrants brought a net benefit to the @entity8			2
in the @entity13 yesterday , he asked @entity10 : ‘ amid all the unpleasantness in parts of the media over the past few weeks about @entity6 and @entity7 , has the noble @entity10 had the time to see the study recently published by a team from @entity51 , which shows that immigrants from the @entity18 over the past 10 years have contributed far more in taxes and national insurance contributions than they have consumed in public services and in benefits , unlike the position of the native population ? ‘ in other words , they have supplied us with a substantial financial and fiscal surplus , to the benefit of every taxpayer in this country			1
‘ is there not every probability that hard - working @entity6 and @entity7 will follow in the same footsteps ? ’ people prepare to board a bus to @entity71 via @entity72 and franceat the central bus station in @entity74 @entity11 @entity71 mayor @entity77 ' if you want to come and work here , you can do that , but there should be a period before which you can claim all benefits and it seems entirely reasonable to me , that they should extend that to two years			1
' @entity86 leader @entity85 ' in terms of immigration , in terms of people coming to settle , i would suggest that for up to a five - year period we do n’t have people coming to settle until we sort out the mess			0
' @entity95 business secretary @entity94 ' setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful , it almost certainly wo n’t achieve the below 100,000 level the @entity99 have set , so let ’s be practical about it			0
’ @entity11 prime minister @entity27 ‘ there are other @entity104 countries who like me think it ’s wrong that someone from @entity108 who comes here , who works hard - and i am absolutely all in favour of that - but i do n’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in @entity108			0
' @entity108 's foreign minister @entity123 ‘ if @entity8 gets our taxpayers , should n’t it also pay their benefits ? why should @entity108 taxpayers subsidise @entity8 taxpayers ’ children ? ’ according to the @entity51 study , those from the @entity129 ( @entity129 ) – the @entity18 plus @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 – made ' a particularly positive contribution in the decade up to 2011 , contributing 34 per cent more in taxes than they received in benefits '			2
immigrants from outside the area , meanwhile , were reported as having contributed 2 per cent more in taxes than they received in the same period			0
however @entity137 , @entity138 at @entity51 , and statistician @entity139 of the @entity141 - leaning think - tank @entity142 have suggested it was a ' fatally flawed ' piece of work			0
they criticism relate to the methodology used to work out the impact migrants are having on housing and the transport network			2
@entity10 said he agreed with the idea that @entity6 and @entity7 would bring net economic benefits to @entity8			1
he later added that all three main political parties including the @entity11 had agreed to the work restrictions being lifted after a seven - year transition period			1
‘ that is why we are very happy with the accession of @entity6 and @entity7 to the @entity18 , and with the free movement of those peoples , from january 1			1
’ however , @entity86 leader @entity85 sparked controversy when he suggested no new immigrants should be allowed into @entity8 for five years			0
he said : ' in terms of immigration , in terms of people coming to settle , i would suggest that for up to a five - year period we do n’t have people coming to settle until we sort out the mess			0
' @entity71 mayor @entity77 also increased pressure on mr @entity27 when he called for immigrants to be banned from claiming benefits in @entity8 for two years , in a direct challenge to government policy			0
weeks after minsters rushed through new laws to extend the ban to three months , mr @entity77 said a much longer limit was needed to stop @entity8 being seen as a ' magnet ' for people from poor parts of @entity104			0
he said : ‘ if you want to come and work here , you can do that , but there should be a period before which you can claim all benefits and it seems entirely reasonable to me , that they should extend that to two years			0

@entity10 backed claims migrants pay more tax and use fewer services
*insists* the government is ' very happy ' about free movement across the @entity18
comes after work restrictions on @entity6 and @entity7 were lifted
