there have been all manner of @entity3 shambles for @entity4 since they should have won the 1992 final here in @entity7			1
but never one as bad as this			0
this , surely , is the worst yet , worse than 1996 when @entity11 ’s pinch - hitters left them trailing in their wake			0
worse , even , than 1999 when @entity4 were eliminated from their own @entity3 the day before the official song came out			2
and it is certainly worse than the last three @entity16 when we had come to expect @entity4 to struggle in the one - day game , particularly in 2007 and last time when the biggest tournament in limited - overs cricket followed the @entity21			2
@entity22 ( right ) was dismissed for just one run as @entity25 bowler @entity24 ( left ) celebrates during the @entity27 tie @entity25 bowler @entity24 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity4 batsman @entity22 during their @entity3 match at the @entity31 @entity4 batsman @entity22 ( left ) walks off after being dismissed while @entity25 celebrate during the @entity3 match @entity25 bowler ahmed ( right ) celebrates with team - mate @entity34 after dismissing @entity4 batsman @entity22 @entity4 batsman @entity35 runs after playing a shot during the @entity3 match with @entity25 in @entity37 @entity25 wicketkeeper @entity38 knocks off the bails to run out @entity35 as @entity4 team - mate @entity40 ( left ) looks on @entity4 batsman @entity35 lays on the ground after being run out by @entity25 wicketkeeper @entity38 during the @entity3 match the 15 - run defeat here by @entity25 at the @entity31 , which confirmed @entity4 ’s abject surrender , is nothing short of an utter humiliation , an embarrassment that , not for the first time in recent years , leaves them as the laughing stock of world cricket			1
this was the @entity3 that @entity4 were supposed to take seriously and prepare thoroughly for			2
this was the @entity3 that the @entity21 were moved for , leading to a 5 - 0 thrashing last winter and all manner of painful recriminations			2
yet so far advanced has the one - day game progressed in the last two years since @entity4 reached the @entity60 final that clearing the calendar and playing only one - day cricket so far this winter has been akin to trying to put a sticking plaster on a gaping wound			2
@entity4 have been able to defeat just @entity66 in this tournament and after being thrashed by @entity7 , @entity68 and @entity11 they have now been humbled by a team in @entity25 who are little more than minnows themselves			2
this tournament was set up to virtually guarantee the progress of the big eight teams to the quarter - finals			0
it was almost impossible for @entity4 to fail to at least get to the last eight where defeat would have been far from a disgrace			0
instead this is a defeat that deserves to be considered as a total disgrace			0
it is one that leaves @entity87 fighting to salvage his reputation as a credible coach of @entity4 and @entity90 , the man who appointed him , facing huge questions about the big decisions he has made			0
when the dust settles and @entity4 have gone through the motions of their last group match against @entity98 they must have a searching examination of how they play one - day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next @entity3 in four years time			1
it is not just @entity87 and @entity104 with much to contemplate			0
senior players such as @entity40 , @entity106 and @entity107 have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one - day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built			1
and the decision to replace @entity114 with @entity115 as one - day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired , the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most			1
@entity115 has been given permission to miss @entity4 ’s first one - day international after this @entity3 , against an @entity125 team having a far better tournament than @entity4 , so he can play in the @entity127			1
that decision frankly stinks and if @entity115 does not want to lead @entity4 into a new one - day era then he should give up the job now and let @entity131 , who was seriously considered when @entity114 was sacked , lead them from now on			1
never mind that @entity132 almost rescued @entity4 after they had fallen to 163 for six chasing 275			0
and never mind that tv umpire @entity133 gave an atrocious decision to rule that @entity135 had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground			1
@entity4 's @entity40 walks from the field after he was dismissed by @entity25 bowler @entity141 ( second from left ) during their match @entity40 's 63 could do little to help @entity4 as they were chasing 276 to avoid an embarrassing early elimination in @entity37 @entity141 ( left ) looks towards @entity4 batsman @entity40 after he is dismissed for 63 during the @entity3 match @entity4 batsman @entity146 came in but was caught behind by @entity25 wicketkeeper @entity38 as bowler @entity148 ( right ) reacts @entity4 captain @entity115 went for a duck against @entity25 on monday - his fifth odi duck in 12 innings @entity131 ( centre ) exchanges words with @entity25 captain @entity148 ( left ) at the @entity31 @entity154 tweeted his reaction to @entity4 's embarrassing elimination at the @entity3 after their defeat by @entity25 90 - the amount of runs captain @entity115 scored in five innings at the @entity3 12.2 - the overs it took for @entity68 to beat @entity4 's total of 123 in their second group game			1
111 - @entity7 's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament 654 - total of runs scored by @entity7 and @entity11 against @entity4 1 - number of centuries scored by an @entity4 batsman against @entity173 playing nations 72 - number of runs scored by @entity11 off the bowling of @entity177 0 - number of wins registered by @entity4 over @entity173 playing nations in the tournament 0 - the number of centuries scored by a @entity25 batsman in a @entity3 before playing @entity4 on monday			1
37.4 - 1 - 234 - 5 - @entity177 's tournament bowling figures			0
49 - the amount of runs @entity186 went for in two overs against @entity68			0
@entity87 went into full @entity189 mode on the sidelines , raging at the fourth official after a truly awful decision , but in truth @entity4 did not deserve to get away with this			0
they were second best to a tigerish @entity25 just as they have been worse than second best throughout this tournament			0
and it all started off so well too			0
it looked as though @entity4 were going to have an easy night when @entity107 found the bite and swing that had eluded him in this tournament to take two wickets in his first seven balls			2
neither @entity203 nor @entity204 , the dangerman at the top of the @entity25 order , could cope as @entity4 made a start full of the sort of aggression and purpose that the seriousness of their plight demanded			0
yet @entity4 could not have expected the resistance and then blossoming strokeplay that came from a batsman who had never made a one - day international century before in @entity217			1
the drop - in pitch at the re-built @entity31 may have been near perfect for batting but the lack of variety in an @entity4 attack that has struggled for penetration in this @entity3 allowed @entity25 to flourish			1
@entity217 found a willing ally in the tiny form of @entity38 , the @entity227 ‘ mighty atom ’ who first faced @entity4 as a 16 - year - old schoolboy 10 years ago , and together they preyed on @entity4 ’s nerves			2
@entity217 certainly enjoyed becoming the first @entity227 to record a hundred in a @entity3 match and while he and @entity38 were adding 141 for the fifth wicket a total beyond 300 looked within his side ’s reach			0
that they fell 25 short of that was down to much improved death bowling from @entity4 , @entity135 in particular showing how it should be done after being preferred to @entity186 in this winner takes all match			0
it should have been well within @entity4 ’s reach but their chase was old - fashioned and flawed with @entity40 , involved in a schoolboy run out that saw the demise of @entity35 , leaving them far too much to do after he had taken 82 balls to reach 63			1
the dismissals of @entity40 and @entity115 in four balls from @entity141 , faster than any @entity4 bowler , left @entity4 deep in the mire and even though @entity132 , their main glimmer of hope for a better one - day future , hit 65 off 52 balls they ended up 16 short			1
the brilliant @entity141 finished it by bowling both @entity106 and @entity107 in three balls in the penultimate over , leaving @entity177 stranded on 42 , to spark off wild @entity227 celebrations			1
for @entity4 it was the end of the world			0
@entity25 batsman @entity217 reacts after scoring his nation 's first - ever century in a @entity3 match @entity217 blows a kiss after reaching @entity25 's first @entity3 century with score of 103 against @entity4 @entity25 batsman @entity217 earned the plaudits after scoring 103 against a poor @entity4 on monday @entity25 sealed a surprise win over @entity4 at the @entity3 as @entity87 and his men suffered early elimination @entity135 dives and leads with his bat as the ball heads towards the stumps during the @entity3 defeat @entity278 bat was judged to have lifted off the ground as the ball struck the stumps and he was run out @entity135 was controversially run out for a duck when his bat was grounded then bounced up as it hit the stumps @entity135 holds his bat in the air after being run out by @entity25 's @entity287 during the @entity3 defeat how the table looks in @entity289 with @entity4 adrift at the @entity3 following their 15 - run defeat by @entity25			1

@entity4 won the toss and decided to bowl first with @entity146 and @entity135 both selected
@entity217 secured @entity25 's first - ever @entity3 century with score of 103
@entity4 had to chase 276 runs to avoid embarrassing elimination at the @entity31
@entity40 got 63 but @entity35 ( 19 ) , @entity146 ( 27 ) , captain @entity115 ( 0 ) and @entity22 ( 1 ) did little to help
@entity4 captain @entity115 got his fifth odi duck in 12 innings in front of *11,963* at the @entity31
@entity135 controversially run out for a duck when his bat was grounded then bounced up as it hit the stumps
@entity106 ( 9 ) and @entity107 ( 0 ) were bowled by @entity141 in three balls in the penultimate over
