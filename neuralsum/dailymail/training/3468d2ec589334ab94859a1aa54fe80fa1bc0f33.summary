parasitic flatworms that can cause liver and blood diseases in humans could become more common as global temperatures rise , according to a new study			1
palaeobiologists at the @entity7 have found evidence in ancient shellfish fossils from around 9,600 years ago of high levels of parasite infestations			1
these trematode flatworms spend part of their life cycle in molluscs like clams , snails and mussels before then infecting fish , and later fish - eating birds and mammals			0
the scientists found that during the @entity24 , when temperatures were about 2.5 ° c warmer than they are today and sea levels were higher , molluscs suffered from far greater levels of infection			1
the researchers studied pits left by parasites in fossilised clam shells like the one above from 9,600 years ago the scientists found that during the @entity24 , when temperatures were about 2.5 ° c warmer than they are today and sea levels were higher , molluscs suffered from far greater levels of infection			1
they warn that as global temperatures are due to increase by up to 4 ° c by the end of the century and sea levels are due to rise , it could mean these parasites could become a growing problem to human health			1
marine biologists have found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water			0
they warn that as the planet 's oceans grow more acidic , due to rising carbon dioxide levels , many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising			0
climate change experts predict that over the next century , the acidity levels of the world 's oceans could drop from @entity59 to @entity60			0
in taste tests shrimp raised in the waters with a lower ph were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting , while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest			0
dr @entity68 , a geological scientist at the @entity7 who led the study , said : ' when compared to documented rises in sea level more than 9,300 years ago , we found that we currently are creating conditions for an increase in trematodes in present - day estuarine environments			1
' this could have harmful implications for both animal and human health , including many of the world 's fisheries			2
' dr @entity68 and his colleagues studied the fossilised shells of ancient clams collected from the @entity87 in @entity88			2
they looked at the oval shaped pits that form in the clam shells as the clams grow around the parasites			2
dr @entity68 said : ' because they have soft bodies , trematodes do not leave body fossils			0
' however , infected clam shells develop oval - shaped pits where the clam grew around the parasite in order to keep it out			2
' the mouth of an adult liver fluke , a type of trematode that can infect humans , magnified by 22 times			0
these parasites could become more common as temperatures warm and sea levels rise , according to new research dr @entity68 compared the pits in shells from clams found in the @entity87 in @entity88 and those from @entity117			1
experts warn that as global temperatures are due to increase by up to 4 ° c by the end of the century and sea levels are due to rise , it may mean parasites could become a growing problem to human health the researchers then compared these findings to clams found in the @entity130 off the coast of @entity117			1
using data that includes highly detailed descriptions of climate change and radiocarbon dating , they noticed clam shells contained more pits in the fossils during times of sea level rise both in @entity88 and @entity117 , when esturies would have been flooded with brackish water			1
trematode infections such as liver flukes , blood flukes and @entity146 can infect humans after eating infected fish			0
at least 56 million people globally suffer from one or more food - borne trematode infections , according to the @entity152			0
the flatworm @entity153 ( pictured ) , a blood fluke or trematode , causes swamp fever in humans a graphic from the @entity159 that shows how many common trematode infections spread			0
dr @entity68 warned that rising sea levels and global temperatures due to climate change could result in a growth in the number of infections the symptoms can include inflammation , fever and can even be fatal			1
at least 56 million people globally suffer from one or more food - borne trematode infections , according to the @entity152			0
dr @entity68 , whose study is published in the journal @entity173 , warned that rising sea levels and global temperatures due to climate change could result in a growth in the number of infections			1
he said : ' the insights offered by our high - resolution @entity24 data are that trematode - prevalence values in brackish settings will be significantly higher during the initial stage of rapid sea - level rise in the coming centuries and will significantly decrease by the maximum flooding stage			2
' an increase in trematode prevalence will have significant implications for ecological and human health			2
' the trematode flatworm @entity146 ( above ) can cause intestine problems in those it infects			0

researchers at the @entity7 studied fossilised clam shells
they looked at pits left in the shells by trematode worms 9,600 years ago
at the time , sea levels were higher and temperatures were 2 ° c warmer
global temperatures are predicted by climate scientists to rise 4 ° c by 2100
scientists warn flatworms may pose an increasing risk to human health
