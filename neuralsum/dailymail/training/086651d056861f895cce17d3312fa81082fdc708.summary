by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today launched a furious attack on a government adviser for rejecting his dream of a brand new four - runway airport in the @entity7			1
the @entity9 mayor said the rebuttal of his @entity12 plan meant the debate about how to increase flights capacity in and out of @entity15 had been set back ' by half a century ' , and claimed the report would simply ' gather dust on a shelf in @entity19 '			0
but he insisted the plan was not dead , as it emerged sir @entity22 's commission will now consider just three options - two additional runway plans at @entity25 and one at @entity27			1
the @entity9 mayor argued that , with expansion at @entity25 constrained , the idea was the only way to keep the @entity15 competitive in terms of airport capacity			2
but the independent @entity29 , which was set up to tackle the need for increased airport capacity and is led by sir @entity22 , is to urge ministers to focus instead on expansion at either @entity25 or @entity27			1
pre-empting the commission 's official announcement , mr @entity2 issues a strongly - worded statement condemning sir @entity22 's decision to turn his back on @entity12			1
mr @entity2 said : ' in one myopic stroke the @entity29 has set the debate back by half a century and consigned their work to the long list of vertically filed reports on aviation expansion that are gathering dust on a shelf in @entity19			1
' he insisted the @entity7 plan ' remains the only credible solution , any process that fails to include it renders itself pretty much irrelevant , and i 'm absolutely certain that it is the option that will eventually be chosen '			0
speaking later on his @entity63 phone - in , he condemned the idea of further expansion of @entity25			2
' with the best will in the world , expanding @entity25 is going to compound a planning error of the 1950s and 1960s ; it 's going to make life worse for @entity9 , it 's going to make things pretty well intolerable for people in parts of the city that do n't even know they 're going to be under the new flight paths			2
' defending his @entity12 plan , he added : ' what this lacks is not planning ability ; what this lacks is political will			0
' what 's happened this morning is basically that sir @entity22 has decided that he 's simply not finding enough support in @entity19 for an idea that is as adventurous and as risky , as he puts it , as the estuary solution			1
' he insisted the idea was not now dead			0
' no , not at all , no more than , say , the @entity32 was dead 100 years ' ago when it was first rejected			0
' mr @entity2 wanted to see a new four - runway airport built in the @entity7 , which would have cost tens of billions of pounds this artist impression by architect @entity93 shows what a four - runway @entity94 capable of handling 150 million passengers a year would haved looked like these are the remaining shortlisted options : but @entity99 said the plan would never have got off the ground			1
shadow transport secretary @entity102 said : ' @entity2 's fantasy island airport plan which would have closed @entity25 and caused longer passenger journeys has finally been dashed			1
' @entity105 and public money should never have been spent on his vanity project whose costs have been put at up to £ 100 billion			0
' this back of a fag packet scheme was designed less for the country 's economic future and more for the omnishables @entity115 's political ambitions			0
' @entity116 , chief executive of the @entity117 , said : ' airlines were never convinced that the @entity7 was either affordable or a convenient location for the majority of their customers			0
' since airlines and their passengers will ultimately have to pay for the development costs of the selected expansion site then the business case must stack up in order for the @entity15 to remain globally competitive			0
' we call upon @entity2 to support the important work of the @entity29 and ensure that the right decisions are made about @entity25 and @entity27			1
' the rejection of the estuary scheme will leave just three options - two additional runway plans at @entity25 and one at @entity27 - still on the table for consideration by the commission , which is charged with recommending where airport expansion should come			1
headed by former @entity142 chief sir @entity22 , the commission is due to make its final report to ministers in summer 2015 - after the general election			1
for many , the favourite option is expansion at @entity25 - an idea that has been totally rejected by mr @entity2			1
the added complication for mr @entity2 is that he is now seeking the @entity151 2015 general election candidacy at @entity152 and @entity153 - a constituency that borders on @entity25 and which contains many people who depend on the west @entity9 airport for their livelihood			1
last december the commission shortlisted the @entity25 and @entity27 options and said it would look further at the estuary option while admitting that it was extremely expensive			2
since then the commission has published reports showing the possible environment cost of the estuary plan			0
mr @entity2 's chief aviation adviser @entity165 said yesterday that not short - listing the estuary option would be ' a sadly short - sighted decision but far from the end of the process '			1
he went on : ' airports policy has been stalled for nearly five decades , ricocheting like a billiard ball between @entity25 and @entity27			2
' we have one opportunity to break out of that but it seems the commission has taken us back to the same old , failed choice			0
but the final decision will lie with the government and a key question now is whether the commission will play much of a role in that			0
' an extra runway at @entity25 could spell more problems for people living under flight paths in @entity9 responding to the @entity188 's decision to rule out the inner @entity7 estuary option , @entity190 , chief executive of the @entity191 ( @entity192 ) , said : ' @entity15 needs additional runway capacity in the @entity194 of @entity195 , but not at any price			2
' with the @entity7 estuary option sensibly ruled out for good , the @entity29 is free now to concentrate on scrutinising the business cases of the three shortlisted options			2
' the proposals must be cost - effective and offer value for money			0
there needs to be a credible funding mechanism based on realistic forecasts and today 's passengers must not be expected to pay for tomorrow 's infrastructure			0
