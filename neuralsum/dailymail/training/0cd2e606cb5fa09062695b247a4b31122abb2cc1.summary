@entity0 today hit back at former @entity2 colleague @entity1 over claims @entity4 wanted to ' clobber ' the rich with new mansion taxes – but refused to say exactly how much people can expect to pay under the levy			1
the shadow chancellor said he ' promised ' the tax on homes worth more than £ 2million would not be implemented in a ' crude ' way and would raise £ 1.2billion a year for the @entity15			1
he said people with homes worth between £ 2million and £ 3million would have to pay £ 250 a month - but he refused to reveal how much people would have to pay if they owned properties worth any more			1
the shadow chancellor @entity0 said he ' promised ' the tax on home worth more than £ 2million would not be implemented in a ' crude ' way and would raise £ 1.2billion a year for the @entity15 mr @entity0 ' remarks came after @entity4 grandee @entity1 last night denounced the flagship policy - claiming it was ' short - termist '			1
the former business secretary said he preferred the @entity29 ' proposal to extend the council tax system with higher rates for more expensive properties , which he said would be better than ' just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short - term mansion tax			1
' but mr @entity0 said that revamping council tax would be ' cumbersome and bureaucratic ' , and said that @entity4 's scheme in fact met @entity1 's requirement for the levy to be banded			1
he sought to reassure those with properties worth just under £ 2million that this threshold will be regularly uprated in line with luxury house prices , and that @entity46 will accept independent valuations obtained by home - owners to determine which side of the line their property falls			2
but he refused to set out in detail what those in home worth more than £ 3million could expect to pay			1
the shadow chancellor told @entity57 's @entity58 : ' i promise you that it wo n't be crude			0
' i do n't want to clobber anyone , but i want to make sure that people who are paying too little tax because they are undertaxed in multi-million pound properties - and many of these are foreign owners who do n't pay tax at all - pay their fair share to the @entity15			2
' @entity1 , one of the architects of @entity4 , has described @entity4 leader @entity70 's plan to impose mansion tax as ' crude ' @entity4 's proposed mansion tax is causing tensions within the party , with strong criticism from many including potential @entity78 candidates @entity79 , dame @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
in an interview with @entity84 last night , @entity1 acknowledged : ' we do n't have an efficient way of taxing property in @entity88			0
' but he added : ' i do n't happen to think the mansion tax is the right policy response to that , i think it 's crude , i think it 's short - termist , what we need is what i think the @entity29 are proposing and that is the introduction of further bands that relate to different values of property within the council tax system , that 's what i would like to see , it will take longer to introduce , that 's true , but it will be more effective and efficient in the long term than just sort of clobbering people with a rather sort of crude short - term mansion tax			1
' full details have yet to be announced , but shadow chancellor @entity0 last year said homes worth between £ 2million and £ 3million will face an annual bill of £ 3,000 , regardless of income			1
critics warn the tax will disproportionately hit @entity112 and the @entity113 , where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans			0
@entity4 estimates the tax will apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the homes in the country			2
people earning less than £ 42,000 will be able to defer paying the charge until their property changes hands in an effort to protect people , especially in the capital , who have seen the value of their house soar in recent years			0
@entity1 said : ' you do need a fair , progressive taxation system where people who are earning the most and accumulating the most wealth pay the most			2
' and for very many people they should n't pay anything at all , because they simply do n't have the incomes , or the wealth , or the assets , to support that			0
' the former business secretary said he was not worried about the message being sent out by the mansion tax , but he added : ' i want policy effectiveness , i want efficiency			2
' i think people are entitled to expect thought - through , sophisticated responses to serious problems			0
' he told @entity84 : ' we have to make sure that what we are doing is , in a sense , recreating the policies that we saw in the @entity155 era , where we saw a pro-business , liberal economic approach but combined with very strong policies and interventions by government in order to create opportunities for individuals and to redistribute income and wealth more fairly			0
' in november , @entity70 ( centre ) was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the mansion tax proposal by singer and classical musician @entity169 ( left ) in a heated television debate conservative party chairman @entity171 said : ' with @entity1 joining the chorus of @entity4 voices opposed to @entity4 's homes tax , it is clearer than ever that @entity70 is a weak leader peddling a bad policy			1
' it is yet more proof that he simply is n't up to the job of running the country			0
' the @entity29 plan , backed by @entity1 , would involve a series of extra bands of taxation for properties worth more than £ 2million on top of council tax			1
earlier this month , @entity188 leader @entity187 caused outrage from within the party after he set out plans to use millions of pounds raised from the tax in @entity193 to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border			2
in november , mr @entity70 was left humiliated after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the proposal by @entity169			0
the singer and classical musician tore strips out of his pledge during a television debate , telling him that it was ' disturbing '			0
' you may as well just tax me on this glass of water , ' she told him during the angry exchange			0
' you ca n't just point at things and tax them			0
