the time is around 9pm on a thursday and 7,000 people are chanting ‘ yes ! yes ! @entity5 ! ’ in a pitch - black car park in @entity4 ’s @entity3			1
it ’s been raining and the ground is damp , but we are all in our bare feet , which are going numb on the cold , hard concrete			1
undeterred , we keep going			2
there ’s a drum pounding in the distance and we keep step with its beat			2
@entity16 attended @entity17 ’ unleash the power within seminarwhich claims to ‘ discover how to identify what it is you really want ' the mood is tribal			1
i feel as if we ’re on our way to a ritual killing			2
we ’ve already signed waivers warning us that what we are about to take part in could result in ‘ physical or emotional injury , paralysis , death			2
’ and we ’ve spent the past half - an - hour being told what we need to do to avoid hospitalisation			1
i feel sick with anticipation , but there ’s no way out — the huge crowd keeps pushing me forward			2
then , the chanting stops and a hush fills the air			2
we are faced with our fate			2
it glimmers grey and red in the darkness : lanes of burning hot coals , which we are to walk over			2
yes , actually walk over — with our bare feet			2
we have spent the past two hours preparing for this moment — being whipped into something called ‘ peak state ’ , a place where you are so mentally strong that you can do anything			1
the idea is that , once you overcome the fear of walking on coals of between 1,200 and @entity62 , you can ‘ conquer the other fires of your life with ease ’			1
but i do n’t conquer anything with ease			2
it ’s not in my nature			2
‘ am i really doing this ? ’ is all i can think			1
but yes , i am			2
for the past year , i ’ve been on a self - improvement mission			1
@entity71 up with a life spent worrying , single and broke , i ’ve set myself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self - help guru each month			1
@entity16 ( pictured ) has set herself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self - help guru each month and this month she chose that of @entity17 and , when it comes to the self - improvement world , @entity17 is the king			1
everyone from world leaders — @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 — to athletes such as @entity87 and actors including @entity89 seek his counsel			1
he even helped princess @entity91 and @entity92			2
his is a classic rags - to - riches story			1
determined to transcend his poor childhood , he became obsessed with self - improvement			1
he ’d listen to motivational tapes on his way to his job as a janitor , before going on to give motivational talks himself			2
fast forward to today and he is a bestselling author and hugely successful business man , whose net worth is in the region of half a billion dollars			2
he charges $ 1 million to coach private clients — which is why the rest of us have to settle for listening to him in a concert hall			2
@entity17 ( pictured in the 1990s ) charges $ 1 million to coach private clients and is the ' king ' of the self - improvement world according to his website , @entity17 ’ unleash the power within seminar would help me ‘ discover how to identify what it is you really want , break through any barriers that might be holding you back , increase your energy and mental clarity , and infuse passion into your life ’			1
but the fortysomething woman next to me in the queue to get in promises that he can deliver			0
she has been three times before , she tells me			0
‘ when you walk over those coals , something changes , ’ she says , her eyes wide			1
‘ i ca n’t explain it , but it ’s just amazing			0
’ she has all the fervour of a fanatic			1
two physiotherapists from @entity140 join in our conversation — they ’ve been sent here by their boss			0
‘ he went last year and got a lot out of it , ’ they say			1
‘ he was on a high for weeks			0
’ and ‘ high ’ is the perfect word for the atmosphere			1
as we file into the arena , there ’s chaos as people rush to get good seats — but no one sits in them			0
they ’re too busy dancing along with the music blasting from the speakers			0
it ’s like being at a @entity163 concert			0
after half - an - hour , @entity164 walks on stage and the screaming goes off the scale			1
people can hardly contain themselves in the presence of the 6 ft 7 in mountain of a man			0
with his @entity174 tan , white teeth and lantern jaw , he looks like something that a @entity179 writer would dream up			0
and just to add to the effect , his chiselled face is blown up to @entity183 - like proportions on massive screens behind him			1
it takes minutes for the applause to die down enough for him to speak — but when he starts , he does n’t stop			0
his basic message is that anything is possible if we just get our minds and bodies into what he calls the peak state			0
he says we are all defined by our limiting beliefs and that if we get rid of these then ‘ the impossible just gets done ’			1
he is the @entity198 : ‘ it ’s impossible to love yourself when you ’re not being yourself ’ ; ‘ change your story , change your life			1
’ these nuggets come out of his mouth from 1pm to 9pm			1
he does n’t take a tea break and neither do we			0
it ’s extraordinary — i ’ve never seen anything like it			0
just the sheer energy of him			0
i find myself thinking that he is the living embodiment of human potential , then i realise i ’m swooning			0
even world leaders like @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) have sought the advice and counsel of @entity17 i turn to the @entity218 man next to me and say : ‘ i think i ’m in love			1
’ he smiles and says : ‘ me , too			1
’ we are all under his spell and will do anything he says , including hugging and high - fiving strangers , and punching our fists in the air while yelling : ‘ yes , yes , yes ! ’ it ’s just so un-english			1
there are moments when i look around at the collective madness and feel as if i ’ve become part of a cult , but i have to make a decision : get embarrassed or go with it			0
as the day goes on , we examine our ‘ limiting beliefs ’			1
i identify mine as being bad with money and always getting sick			0
and then he asks us to visualise what life would be like if we got rid of these limiting beliefs			0
i imagine being healthy , energetic and productive , someone who just gets things done without always worrying about the things that can go wrong			0
i imagine my bank account being in the black and owning a property			0
to build on this vision , we ’re taught how to get into a peak state by thinking of the best moment of our lives , the moment we felt strongest and most at peace			0
i think of times with loved ones and professional achievements that i ’m proud of			0
each time we do we are told to ‘ make a move ’ , so every time we make that move in the future , these memories will come back			1
i pump my fist in the air , again and again and again			0
i ca n’t believe i ’m doing it — it ’s so not me			0
i feel as if i ’m in the film @entity268			0
and then the time comes to walk on fire			0
we ’re told to take off our shoes and socks and march out of the conference centre to the 8 ft lines of coal in the car park			0
@entity17 is said to have also helped well - known face including @entity91 ( left ) and former prime minister , @entity92 ( right ) a part of me wants to run away , but a bigger part of me knows that i can do this			1
then i ’m standing in front of the coals and two men are instructing me to shout : ‘ yes ! ’ i do			1
they say ‘ make your move ! ’ and i pump my fist in the air			1
then , i go for it			0
i put my foot on the coals and after that i remember nothing — until my last step , when i could feel heat			0
i have half - a - second of panic when i realise what i ’m doing — but , by then , my feet are on the cold square of grass put at the end of the fire and my feet are being hosed down by helpers			1
i ’ve walked across a bed of hot coals			0
two weeks later , i still can not answer those questions , but i find myself having the same thoughts as the woman i met in the queue at the start of that day			0
that strange moment of collective hysteria , when we walked over hot coals , has changed something within me			0
if i can walk on fire without barbecuing my feet , what else can i do ? i ’m very keen to find out			0
