a mysterious explosion that rocked @entity1 on saturday night , creating a 39ft - wide crater , appears to have been caused by a small meteorite			1
and authorities in the region believe the meteorite was in fact a shard of rock from the 2014 rc ‘ pitbull ’ asteroid that soared past @entity11 over the weekend			1
the impact , close to the country ’s international airport , did not cause any known injuries , but the hit was powerful enough to be felt throughout the capital , according to reports			1
the explosion hit woodland in @entity22 in @entity1 on saturday and created a crater measuring 39 feet ( 12 metres ) wide ( pictured )			1
authorities in the region believe it was a shard of rock from the 2014 rc ‘ pitbull ’ asteroid that soared past @entity11 at a similar time to the impact tests are now being carried out on the crater to learn more about how it was formed			1
‘ we are convinced that this was a meteorite			0
we have seen the crater from the impact , ’ said @entity33 of the @entity34			2
@entity39 estimates the 2014 @entity41 asteroid to be approximately 65ft ( 20 metres ) wide - roughly the same size as a large house			1
this makes it similar in size to the @entity48 meteorite that exploded over @entity51 ’s @entity50 region in february 2013			0
at the time of closest approach , asteroid 2014 @entity41 was said to be one - tenth the distance from the centre of @entity11 to the moon - or about 25,000 miles ( 40,000km )			1
the asteroid was reported as passing closest to earth at approximately 7.18pm bst ( 2.18pm est ) , as it travelled over @entity60			1
it did not hit @entity11 , but its orbit will bring it back to our planet 's neighbourhood in the future			1
the asteroid 's future motion will be closely monitored , but no future threatening @entity11 encounters have been identified , according to @entity39			1
the @entity1 authorities continued that the timing of the impact fits closely with the passing of the [ ' pitbull ' ] asteroid , which passed very close to @entity11 on sunday			1
a meteorite was also spotted flying over @entity78 on sunday evening , and astrophysicists are trying to determine if the two events are related			0
before the event , @entity39 estimated the asteroid to be approximately 65ft ( 20 metres ) wide - roughly the same size as a house			1
this makes it similar in size to the @entity48 meteorite that exploded over @entity51 ’s @entity50 region in february 2013			0
at the time of its closest approach , asteroid 2014 @entity41 was said to be one - tenth the distance from the centre of @entity11 to the moon - or about 25,000 miles ( 40,000km )			1
the meteorite , which may have splintered from the asteroid , is said to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight , and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments @entity33 's organisation uses to measure earthquakes			1
this is the incredible moment an asteroid the size of a house skimmed past the @entity11			1
the rock , known as @entity41 or @entity107 , made the unexpected close approach during the early hours of september 8 before the event , @entity39 estimated the asteroid ( @entity39 image , pictured ) to be approximately 65ft ( 20 metres ) wide - roughly the same size as a large house			1
the asteroid was reported to have been closest to @entity11 at approximately 7.18pm bst ( 2.18pm est ) , over @entity60 the meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport in the @entity1 capital ( pictured ) at around midnight on saturday			1
the hit was so large , experts at the @entity34 said it registered on the instruments used to measure earthquakes ‘ you can see two waves : first , a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth , and then another stronger one , which is the impact of the sound , ’ mr @entity33 continued			2
government officials and experts visited the impact site on sunday			0
one of them , @entity132 , said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil			0
‘ you can see mirror - like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power - scraped the walls , ’ @entity132 said			2
2014 @entity41 zipped passed a cluster of television and weather satellites around 22,000 miles from the @entity11 's surface at around 8pm @entity145 time			2
@entity39 scientists said it would be difficult to spot the asteroid without using a telescope and that it is likely to be even closer to the moon the whale - sized asteroid had a ‘ very close ’ shave with @entity11 on sunday			1
this image shows the orbit of @entity154 around the sun. the asteroid is about 60ft ( 20 metres ) across in size dr @entity158 , an astronomy expert at @entity159 , told @entity160 : ' the possible meteorite impact in @entity1 , linked with the @entity154 which flew by @entity11 last night , raises some interesting questions			1
' although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed @entity11 , that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it			1
' if it was an unrelated object , however , then it further demonstrates how we do n’t really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there			0
' government spokeswoman , first lady @entity172 , said @entity22 would be in contact with the @entity174 to try to get more information about ‘ this fascinating event ’ in the @entity178 nation , one of @entity181 's poorest countries			1
the asteroid was reported as passing closest to earth at approximately 7.18pm bst ( 2.18pm est ) , as it travelled over @entity60			1
its predicted trajectory is pictured			0
it did not hit @entity11 , but its orbit will bring it back to our planet 's neighbourhood in the future , and will be closely monitored by @entity39 government officials and experts visited the impact site on sunday			2
they said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil			0
tests are now being carried out to determine more about the impact ( pictured ) asteroid 2014 @entity41 is said to be similar in size to the @entity48 meteorite that exploded over @entity51 ’s @entity50 region in february 2013 ( pictured ) people who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion , and that liquid , sand and dust were blown through the air , which smelled like something had burned			1
there were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot , and flights at the airport were not affected			0

the asteroid 's future motion will be closely monitored , but no future threatening @entity11 encounters have been identified , according to @entity39			2
the date of @entity11 's potential destruction has been set at 16 march 2880 , when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet			2
researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly that it should break apart , but somehow remains intact on its @entity11 - bound trajectory			2
they believe it is held together by cohesive forces known as @entity245 - and although this is considered a major breakthrough , scientists still do n't know how to stop it			0
the discovery was made by researchers at the @entity251 ( @entity251 ) , @entity252			0
previous research has shown that asteroids are loose piles of rubble held together by gravity and friction			0
the asteroid is travelling at about 9 miles ( 15km ) a second relative to the @entity11			2
it is due to swing so close to @entity11 it could slam into the @entity262 at 38,000 miles per hour			2
it is estimated that if 1950 @entity263 were to collide with the planet , it would do so with a force of around 44,800 megatonnes of @entity266			0
although the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent , this represents a risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids			0
the @entity78 meteorite was spotted above @entity274 on sunday evening , and was monitored by the @entity275 ( @entity276 )			0
its fireball was spotted by thousands of people , who uploaded images of the rock to social networks			0
@entity78 astrophysicist , @entity284 , said : ' we think the meteorite may have flown over more areas of the country including @entity289 , however , because it was pretty cloudy there we believe it may have been widely missed , and was only spotted when it emerged over a clear area that included @entity274			0

@entity284 added : ' calibration requires weeks of research when there is an absence of stars in the images			0
but nevertheless , it has been made easier thanks to all the social media video footage and pictures			0
' local emergency services also received several calls about the meteorite from panicked people wondering if it might be a plane or a @entity334 on fire			0
it is believed that the suspected meteorite crashed in a remote location			0
@entity284 added that , given the size of the fireball , the suspected meteorite was almost certainly too large to have burnt up and therefore would have impacted somewhere – adding : ' the question now is to find out where			0
