a baby clothing company is being accused of fat - shaming babies after it came out with a onesie with the saying , ' i hate my thighs ' on the front			1
the kitschy company @entity7 was brought into the spotlight after @entity10 editor @entity9 published a blog on march 10 saying the supposedly humorous onesie was actually detrimental to babies ' body image			1
' yes , we know — it 's meant to be funny			0
after all , the company that sells this onesie with the saying " @entity19 " is named @entity20			1
and we feminists do have a sense of humor			0
but really , there 's something icky about projecting fat awareness on babies , ' @entity24 posted on the magazine 's blog			2
the company then offered with with an alternative saying , ' @entity49			2
' @entity20 posted a pretend poll in the comments section of @entity24 's post sarcastically asking consumers which onesie they preferred to see , one that favored cynicism ( i hate my thighs ) or the other one which favored sweetness ( @entity49 ) , reports @entity61			1
@entity20 's true to form snarky response joked that the style that gets the most buyers will be the one they keep and that the proceeds from selling both will go to the @entity67			2
@entity24 did n't find @entity20 's response especially funny			2
' please make the donation to @entity10 , @entity70			1
the @entity67 is an entirely separate organization , ' she wrote			0
' and sorry that we do n't see much difference between i hate my thighs and @entity49 ; the subtext of the latter is that someone would not be loved for her leg rolls			1
but of course we 're making too much of this , right ? ' today reports that @entity20 posted on their @entity82 that they are merely trying to make parenting fun			0
new alternative : after the ' i hate my thighs ' jumper caused fury among some women , the company @entity7 offered another alternative that said ' @entity49 ' other funsies : these fun baby onesies are among @entity20 's kitsch collection of baby gear ' what we ’re trying to do is make the entire parenting experience as fun as humanly possible , ' writes @entity70 co-owner @entity101			1
' we equate having kids with having a good time			0
why should n’t it be ? ' @entity70 continued to fight back against @entity24 's criticism of them and wrote on march 12 , ' we could n’t agree more about body image			1
‘ that ’s why we made an ironic joke about it			0
obviously no baby would or should hate their thighs ! ... but we ’re glad you ’re able to froth up your readers this week and shine a light on what is apparently a vital mission of @entity10 – reviewing baby clothes			1
' @entity24 spoke with @entity120 and said she hoped that @entity70 would stop basking in the spotlight and focus on the health of babies ' body image			2
' think about your daughters , ' @entity24 added , ' and what message that you want to convey to them			0
' some other messages from @entity70 are sporty onesies with the sayings , ' silently judging you , ' ' bringing @entity133 , ' and ' @entity134			0
' it 's likely that the babies sporting the onesies will need some help from mom and dad reading what they say and understanding what they mean			0
