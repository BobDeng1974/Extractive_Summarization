paper is handy for shopping lists , toilet roll and good old - fashioned books			1
but paper make - up ? i do n’t think so			1
but that shows how little i know because it seems that the latest beauty must - have looks like a pad of post-it notes			2
@entity11 are sheets of paper infused with foundation , blusher , highlighter and bronzer — all you have to do is sweep the paper over your face for a flawless finish			1
@entity22 ( pictured ) tests the @entity23			2
after trying the shade ' @entity25 ' @entity24 said it 's the best blusher she 's ever tried the idea is that you use them to top up your make - up during the day or you can even use them instead of your usual products for a sheer , natural make - up look			1
brilliant for on the go make - up , the papers replace your make - up bag with a product that can fit in your pocket			1
they are all contained neatly inside a wallet so they are lightweight and compact and wo n’t spill all over your handbag			2
they also have the added bonus of acting like blotting papers — favoured by make - up artists to absorb excess oil from the face to reduce shine — and an alternative to applying pressed powder to matte the skin which often looks cakey			1
it sounds too good to be true — like another gimmick designed to relieve us of our money			2
i decide to try them			2
the sheets of foundation powder cost £ 12.50 for 50 sheets — one is enough to cover the whole face			1
this works out at 25p per sheet , so slightly cheaper than my usual £ 26.55 bottle of @entity71 foundation , which lasts three months			1
but still , i am sceptical			2
my skin can be blotchy and red , so i like my foundation to be thick and creamy			1
the @entity75 ( pictured ) are available infused with foundation , blusher , highlighter and bronzer			1
the sheets of foundation powder cost £ 12.50 for 50 sheets — one is enough to cover the whole face i ’m of the ‘ more is more ’ school when it comes to a base — i do n’t believe a tiny square of tissue paper will give me the coverage i want			1
i sweep the foundation paper all over my face , pressing more firmly where i need more coverage			1
i must admit that it goes on easily and smoothly and gives more coverage than i was expecting , but it is too powdery			0
it collects on the dry skin on my chin and forehead , i keep trying to blot and blend with the paper but , as a result , i keep putting more powder on , which is not what i want			1
and even though i use the palest of the three shades available , it ’s a bit too orange for my skin			0
so far , so unimpressive			0
next i try the trio pack of blusher , bronzer and highlighter sheets			0
i ’ve never got on well with bronzer			0
i prefer to stay pale and interesting and on the couple of times i ’ve tried it , my skin colour looks fake and @entity116 - y. not with this one			0
because the powder on the sheets is so fine — it ’s talc free — it goes on so lightly that you barely notice it , but it gives a gorgeous soft glow with a slight shimmer			0
i love it , but not as much as i love the highlighter sheets			0
like bronzer , i ’ve never got the hang of highlighter			0
i have tried a product called @entity130 — which comes in a nail varnish - like applicator — but it ’s messy and i lost patience with it , but this is totally different			0
i fold up the paper and blot it on the top of my cheekbones — and voila ! the result is soft , but illuminating			1
no mess , no streaks			0
finally , i pat the blusher paper on the apples of my cheeks			1
i apply a shade called @entity25 — and with one papery push my cheeks are the prettiest , most natural glow			0
i can honestly say it ’s the best blusher i ’ve ever tried			0
the overall effect was a revelation			0
i ’m still not crazy about the foundation , but it blends well with the bronzer , blush and highlighter			1
i feel as if i ’m not wearing any make - up , but my skin looks even and luminous			0
@entity23 do n’t do any eyeshadows , but i ’m told the bronzer can also double as one			0
@entity23 do n't make a lip colour yet , @entity24 ( pictured ) tested the papers out on her lips but although it looked nice initially , it quickly came off it works a treat — i dab it on quite heavily to get the most colour of it and use a brush to blend it			1
it ’s super fine and sits on my skin perfectly , giving some definition to my eyes without looking too heavy			0
they do n’t do lip colour either , but i try the blush sheets on my lips to see what happens			0
i choose a darker blusher sheet and though it looks pretty it comes off within minutes			0
the next day i try a light dusting of the foundation sheet on top of my usual cream foundation and the effect is perfect — lightly matte , with a soft glow			1
throughout the day i blot my skin with the foundation powder and the blusher , even doing it on the train without a mirror , and it works a treat			2
a revolution for practical make - up on the go and ideal for those of us who suffer from an oily complexion , paper make - up is more genius than gimmick			2
from now on i wo n’t leave home without my little book of powdered paper			2

@entity11 are infused with foundation and other products
all you have to do is wipe the paper over your face for a flawless finish
they also have the added bonus of acting like blotting papers
