by @entity0 last updated at 7:20 am on 4th october 2011 tragic : @entity1 died after after going four days without proper food at @entity3 hospital staff have been accused of starving a grandmother to death after failing to feed her for four days			1
@entity1 , 67 , was admitted after a fall and designated as ‘ nil by mouth ’ by medics due to a risk of choking			1
however , it took four days before she was given a feeding tube to supply her with much - needed nutrients			1
by then , the mother of two ’s condition had worsened and she died the following day			2
her son @entity17 , a company director , said : ‘ i saw a vulnerable but vivacious and warm lady deteriorate rapidly and die in that hospital			1
’ at her inquest , the coroner criticised @entity3 in @entity22 for the delay and for allowing her care to ‘ drift ’ after a bank holiday weekend			2
mr @entity17 said : ‘ although my mother had some underlying problems such as multiple sclerosis , she was essentially starved to death			2
‘ she just slipped through the cracks			2
everyone kept saying she needed food and that she was malnourished but nothing was done			2
’ mrs @entity1 , who was divorced from her husband @entity35 , was admitted to hospital late on may 29 last year , a bank holiday weekend			1
mr @entity17 and his sister @entity38 , a philosophy academic , had gone to visit their mother and found her in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs			0
doctors had initially focused on a head injury and fractured ribs , but mr @entity17 , 41 , said he raised concerns about his mother ’s nutrition from the outset			0
‘ she was naturally slim , and prior to her admission had not really been eating enough due to tiredness from her @entity54 we constantly prompted staff with regard to feeding and eating because mum was thin and ate little			0
we were concerned it may well get ignored as catering staff tend to just leave food and collect it later			0
‘ we could see the situation was getting more serious each day			0
’ starved : @entity1 was taken to @entity3 with a head injury but she later died of malnourishment even though staff knew she was at a ' high risk ' of malnourishment , an inquest heard the inquest heard mrs @entity1 ate some supper on may 30 , the day after her admission , but was then sick several times			1
the following morning she had some breakfast , but was designated ‘ nil by mouth ’ due to a risk of choking on her food at some point on tuesday , june 1			0
by thursday she had developed ketoacidosis – a serious condition caused through malnutrition when acid levels in the blood become dangerously high			0
when eventually a feeding tube was fitted on the friday evening , it took a further 16 hours for it to be activated because an x-ray to check the position of the tube had not been done			0
mr @entity17 said : ‘ when i arrived on the saturday morning and asked why it had n’t been done , we were told the x-ray department was busy and did n’t deem her urgent			0
she was dead in 24 hours			0
’ doctors at the inquest described mrs @entity1 , of @entity90 , @entity22 , as ‘ gaunt ’ and suggested she had a history of alcoholism and malnutrition – all of which mr @entity17 disputes			1
coroner @entity95 recorded a narrative verdict and raised concerns that it took four days for mrs @entity1 to receive food direct to her stomach through the tube			1
@entity102 said in a statement : ‘ mrs @entity1 was admitted to hospital with a head injury and chronic malnourishment			1
staff were concerned about her very low weight and specialist feeding assessments were arranged			0
‘ however , mrs @entity1 quickly developed serious complications and sadly , despite treatment , she later died			1

@entity1 was in hospital for four days before she was fed
