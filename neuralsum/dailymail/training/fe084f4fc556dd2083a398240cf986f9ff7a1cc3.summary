by @entity1 reporter published : 05:52 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 08:46 est , 30 august 2012 @entity3 writer @entity2 sparked controversy for claiming @entity6 mass killer @entity5 , whom he described as ' without doubt what @entity6 deserves ' a @entity3 author has sparked controversy after saying that @entity6 mass killer @entity5 is ' without doubt what @entity6 deserves '			1
@entity2 , who says he has read all 1,500 pages of @entity5 ’s online manifesto in which the @entity6 lays out his world view , insists that he does not approve of the gunman ’s crimes			1
however , the respected writer and editor praised @entity5 ’s writing and cry of hatred for social democracy , immigration and multi-culturalism			1
' @entity5 is without doubt what @entity6 deserves , ' wrote @entity2 in an 18 - page pamphlet			1
he is ' as much a child of a broken family as of an ideological and racial fracture caused by immigration from outside @entity30 over the last 20 years ' , added @entity2 , who has edited several award - winning books in @entity3			1
his writing about @entity5 has sparked consternation in the literary circles , with one author @entity36 calling the text ' a politically dangerous act '			1
another author @entity39 said : ' he has lost his head			2
' others were less critical			2
' he is still my editor , ' said @entity44			2
' i do n’t want to take any public position on the subject			2
@entity2 believes only in literature			1
' he is someone who writes marvellously well			2
his questionable ideas do not reduce his literary qualities , ' he argued			2
@entity5 was last week sentenced to 21 years in prison for killing 77 people in a bomb attack and deadly shooting rampage that shook @entity6			1
in a manifesto he published online before the attacks , @entity5 wrote that ' patriotic resistance fighters ' should use trials ' as a platform to further our cause '			1
the respected @entity3 writer has claimed mass killer @entity5 ( pictured ) was ' without doubt what @entity6 deserves ' carnage : the aftermath of the @entity66 car bomb planted by mass killer @entity5 blast : the bomb at the high - rise government building left scores injured last year he claimed to be part of a secret organisation modelled on the medieval christian military order the @entity75 , which aimed to purge @entity30 of @entity77 influence			1
police found no trace of the organisation , however , and said he acted alone			2
the document laid out a blueprint for a multi-phase ' revolution ' , targeting left - leaning political elites he accused of destroying their own societies by admitting large numbers of immigrants , especially from @entity77 countries			2
the document spelt out @entity5 's extreme nationalist philosophy as well as his methods			1
it described how he bought guns , tons of fertiliser and other bomb components , hid collections of weapons and evaded police suspicion in the run - up to the attacks			2
@entity104 : surveillance footage shows @entity5 , dressed in police uniform and carrying a pistol , as he walks away from a car after placing a bomb in @entity66 last year force : this photo shows members of the @entity6 @entity113 land by boat on the shore of the island of @entity117 during @entity5 's shooting spree before the killings , @entity5 spent much of his time absorbed in online gaming , mostly playing the @entity122			1
he was a high school dropout and , the court heard , made money by forging diplomas and certificates under the company name @entity129 , which folded in 2006			0
he released a @entity131 video six hours before the attacks calling for conservatives to ' embrace martyrdom '			0
it included pictures of him wearing a wetsuit and pointing an automatic weapon			0
in a text with the video he detailed his plans for the attacks , writing that he would ' dress up as a police officer ' , adding that it would ' be awesome as people will be astonished '			1
chilling : @entity5 walks with a gun among the bodies strewn around @entity117 island during his rampage last july @entity148 : teenagers on the @entity6 holiday island of @entity117 had to ' swim for their lives ' and hide in trees when @entity5 fired indiscriminately at them in the wake of the attacks , anxious to prove he was not insane , @entity5 called right - wing extremists and radical islamists to give their public support for his view of clashing civilizations			1
it was widely reported that he had made postings on @entity165 nationalist websites			0
but @entity6 authorities said there was no evidence of links to the @entity171 far - right			0
@entity5 derided a jail term as ' pathetic ' , and said acquittal or execution were the only reasonable outcomes , although the country does not have the death penalty			1
@entity5 's rampage began when eight people were killed after his car bomb exploded at the high - rise @entity6 government headquarters in @entity66 at 3.26pm			1
it left a dust - clogged square covered in twisted metal and shattered glass			0
police described it as an ' @entity190 - type ' bombing , perpetrated by a home - grown assailant and using the same mix of fertiliser and fuel that blew up a building in the @entity197 in 1995			0
the bomb was packed into a panel truck outside the building			0
an agricultural supplier said @entity5 bought six tonnes of fertiliser in the weeks before the explosion			1
but as police battled to deal with the effects of the bomb , a much more deadly attack was about to begin 20 miles north - west of the capital			0
@entity5 , dressed as a policeman , drove to a lake outside the capital and took a ferry to the island of @entity117 , where hundreds of young people were attending a summer camp organised by the youth wing of the @entity216			1
at around 4.50pm he opened fire , claiming another 69 lives			0
it is claimed that he beckoned to his young victims before shooting them one by one			0
survivors of the shooting spree described hiding and fleeing into the water to escape			0
police arrived on the island an hour and a half after the gunman first opened fire , because they did not have quick access to a helicopter and could not find a boat to reach the scene just several hundred yards away			0
when the armed officers did locate a boat they overloaded it , causing it to break down			0
@entity5 surrendered when officers finally reached him on @entity117 at 6.35pm			1
@entity66 police director @entity238 said later : ' i regret we were n't able to arrest the suspect earlier than we did			0
could police have been faster ? the answer is yes			0
' if the boat had n't been over capacity , police would have been on @entity117 faster			0
if it would have led to another and better result is nothing we know for sure , but we ca n't rule it out			0
' and it 's tough , like i 've said before , to think that lives thereby would have been saved			0
' chilling accounts soon emerged of what happened at the camp			0
a 15 - year - old , @entity258 , said she heard gunshots but then saw a police officer and thought she was safe			0
then the man started shooting people in front of her			1
she said : ' i saw many dead people			1
he first shot people on the island			1
afterwards he started shooting people in the water			2
' @entity273 , 21 , said several victims ' had pretended they were dead to survive '			2
but after shooting them with one gun , he blasted them in the head with a shotgun , he added .			0

@entity2 says he has read all 1,500 pages of @entity5 ’s online manifesto
