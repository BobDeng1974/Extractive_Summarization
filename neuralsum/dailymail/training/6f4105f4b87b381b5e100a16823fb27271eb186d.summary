adrenaline junkies travel from all over the globe to test their skills at the spectacular location perfect for everything from climbing to skydiving , base jumping and slacklining			1
discovered in the breath - taking @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity19 , the @entity21 playground features vast terrain perfect for top climbers			1
daredevil : adrenaline junkie @entity25 balances on a slackline rope between the highest towers in @entity16 , @entity28 and @entity29 , 800 ft above the ground the towers range from 35ft at their smallest to the soaring @entity28 and @entity33 towers which take up to five days to climb and a further two days to rig the 225ft long highline			1
adventure - loving @entity35 , 24 , and friends @entity25 and @entity37 have spent more than 40 days testing their skills in the desert over the past nine months			0
mr @entity35 , from @entity39 , @entity40 said : ‘ it 's been a playground for many people but it was n't really until motivated @entity25 showed up , that jumping off the towers became a priority			1
what a view : @entity48 enjoys the view of the world 's biggest playground from her 95 ft long rope , 250 ft up in the air meet me in the middle : mr @entity25 and @entity37 perch on a ' spaceline ' , rigged from three separate points , allowing three people to walk on the ropes at once posing : mr @entity25 is comfortably confident 250 ft up , pulling faces , left , and doing a ' double drop knee ' position , right , just for the camera ‘ the @entity66 is a segment of the @entity68 - a non-restrictive entity allowing adventurers to turn beautiful features into a playground			1
‘ our aim was to climb , slackline and establish base jumps off all the major towers in the region finishing with the 800ft @entity33 tower			1
‘ @entity25 is one of very few who have jumped off all five of the main towers			2
‘ probably less than three other people have done this - i still have one more to jump			2
celebration : the trio celebrate after climbing @entity85 , a 250 ft tower with iconic summit above crumbling rock below taking the plunge : the moments mr @entity25 jumped off the highest tower , 800 ft high , while friends @entity35 and ms @entity37 watched from below ‘ it was incredibly exciting for us as due to the difficulty and poor rock quality so to pursue them further with slacklines and safe jumping locations was a very fulfilling goal			1
@entity99 is done with a specially - designed rope known as a slackline and is considered to be more challenging than a conventional tightrope as the line is not completely taut , therefore susceptible to bouncing and stretching			0
mr @entity35 said : ‘ @entity85 is the most popular tower to climb and the rock in this area is essentially petrified mud with only the stronger layers of the hillside remaining after years of erosion			0
death defying duo : @entity112 flies his parachute close to mr @entity25 on his slackline post-plunge : after jumping off the highest tower , 800 ft high , mr @entity25 and mr @entity112 open their parachutes in preparation to land ‘ it 's about 250ft tall and has an iconic summit perched above the crumbling rock below			1
the diameter is about 2ft allowing for only the boldest of climbers to stand on top			0
‘ we can also create a “ spaceline ” here - which is essentially a slackline rigged between three separate points that all meet in the middle			0
‘ it allows three people to be walking simultaneously			0
‘ the line is about 400ft high and you can see how comfortable the guys were			2
’ outstanding outline : mr @entity25 and ms @entity37 balance on a 35 ft long slackline while @entity141 flies his base canopy around the summit mr @entity35 , who has been slacklining for 10 years and @entity144 jumping for four years , got his first taste of slacklining when he saw one at a climbing competition he was competing in			1
he was so amazed by the slackline that he forgot to compete and just slacklined all day			0
base jumping followed after skydiving for a year , thanks to a friend who inspired him by showing him all the beautiful places he had jumped			1
mr @entity35 said : ‘ spending time here is just unbelievable			0
everyone is great friends and you never know who you might bump into			0
‘ on @entity28 and @entity33 we did a few base flybys from a jump higher up with base jumper extraordinaire @entity112			2
‘ @entity25 took to the highline while @entity112 flew extra close under his base canopy			2
‘ @entity112 got within 3 - 4ft of him before zooming on through the rest of the towers			0
‘ i do n't think there is anywhere else in the world you could have that much fun			0
’ spectacular scenery : mr @entity25 is dwarfed by the huge tower he has climbed			0
