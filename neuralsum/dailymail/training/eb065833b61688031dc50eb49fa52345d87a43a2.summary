a cup of @entity2 coffee is considered the height of luxury and can cost as much as £ 60 , however the price in animal welfare has left a bitter taste			1
now @entity8 has decided to remove the exclusive and highly prize coffee from shelves following concerns about the impact on the civet cats that are crucial to its production			1
@entity8 had sold the product , sourced from a small supplier , until october 2013			0
bizarrely , the coffee , which is said to have a uniquely smooth taste , is harvested from the excrement of the civet cat			1
' luxury ' : the £ 60 cup of coffee , no longer sold in @entity8 , is made from the excrement of civet cats ( right ) historically , plantation workers in the forests of @entity29 discovered that the civet cats in the wild would only eat the finest coffee beans			1
they collected the part digested beans excreted by the animals and made coffee that had a unique flavour			1
it was believed that the quality of the beans , coupled with the effects of the part digestion in the animal ’s body were needed to develop the taste			0
as the coffee became known around the world , so a market developed with the result that farmers captured and caged the wild cats to ensure a plentiful and ready supply			2
however , animal welfare campaigners found the conditions in the tiny battery farm style cages are often cruel , filthy and inhumane			1
@entity29 farmers found the cats harvested high - quality beans as they only feed off high - quality ingredients undercover video footage by welfare campaigners found the tiny civets exhibiting neurotic behaviour such as incessant pacing , spinning and head - bobbing – indications that the wild - caught animals are going insane from boredom			1
one farmer explained civets are generally kept caged for around three years			0
another compared civets eating too many coffee berries to humans smoking , as their health deteriorates during captivity because of a lack of vitamins and nutrition			0
the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) has campaigned to highlight the suffering with the result that @entity8 has decided to remove the coffee from sale			0
' dangerous ' : animal rights campaigners claim the discovery ahs led to civets being kept in battery farm - style cages the move follows an earlier decision by @entity90 to stop selling coffee produced from caged civets			1
however , a number of @entity95 websites are currently selling the controversial coffee for between £ 180 and £ 300 a kilo			2
the @entity78 has launched a campaign for an independent certification scheme to ensure the coffee only comes from civet cats that are not held in cages			1
it has contacted a series of retailers in the @entity95 and around the world asking what steps they are taking to verify whether their coffee is from farmed or wild civets			2
the animal charity has met with the @entity112 and @entity113 , two organisations working across the world to certify that food products such as coffee meet responsible animal welfare standards			0
dr @entity119 , the head of wildlife research at @entity78 , said : ‘ retailers all over the world have committed to only obtain civet coffee from guaranteed ‘ cage - free ’ sources and it is clear that this is the animal friendly product that consumers want			2
‘ we are encouraged by the dialogue we have had with these leading international certification bodies which we hope will result in retailers and consumers being able to make an informed and humane choice , preventing the cruel capture and confinement of hundreds of civets			0
’ despite the controversy surrounding its production , the civet cat coffee still retains an air of luxury and mystery			2
it recently featured in the @entity152 move , @entity145 , where @entity147 ’s terminally ill character chose it as one of the experiences he must try before he dies			0
a spokesman for @entity8 said the company previously sold civet coffee from a small sustainable supplier , however it has now decided to permanently remove it from shelves			0
there is no evidence that the coffee it was selling came from mistreated animals .			0
