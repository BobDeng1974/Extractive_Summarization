@entity0 produced a match - winning performance for @entity4 's under 21s on monday night as they defeated @entity6 2 - 0 , winning a penalty and scoring an eye - catching individual goal			1
and his classy display drew high praise from an @entity13 legend afterwards			1
@entity14 , who was summarising the match for @entity16 , was very impressed by the teenager 's abilities			2
@entity4 's teenage striker @entity0 chases the ball in a @entity21 match with @entity22 @entity4 legend @entity14 , working as a pundit on @entity16 , praised @entity0 's performance talking about @entity0 's second - half strike , his 22nd of the season , @entity14 said : ' it was an outstanding finish			1
' he got the penalty [ converted by @entity29 ] and was maybe fortunate in the first - half but there he left them for dead			1
' centre - backs do n't like being put in that position out wide			0
he has pace and composure on his weak foot			0
' but who is the hotshot winning such high - profile admirers ? @entity41 has everything you need to know			0
@entity0 breaks beyond the @entity6 defender @entity44 during monday night 's under 21 match in @entity46 @entity0 slams home @entity4 's second goal in the 2 - 0 win over @entity6 on monday night name : @entity0 age : 18 club : @entity4 position : striker @entity14 certainly is n't the first pundit to notice the spectacular season @entity0 is having in @entity4 's academy teams			1
across the under 18 , under 19 and under 21 age groups , the @entity59 youth international has found the net 22 times this campaign			0
@entity6 , the defending champions in the under 21 league , were hoping to leapfrog a cluster of clubs and claim top spot as they headed to the @entity66 in @entity46 on monday night			2
but @entity0 and @entity4 had other ideas			2
after just eight minutes , @entity0 used his abundant pace to get in behind the @entity70 defence and was wrestled to the ground by @entity72			0
@entity29 , another highly - rated player , converted the spot - kick			0
@entity0 's unpredictable movement had been a headache all night and , shortly after half - time , he again burst past @entity72 and finished high into the net from an acute angle			1
@entity0 gets away from the @entity6 back line during @entity4 's 2 - 0 win on monday night @entity0 scored twice as @entity4 's under 19s beat @entity81 in the @entity21 it was the assured finish of a player in the best form of his life and someone well on the way to achieving his obvious potential			1
this was just one example of the many types of goal @entity0 is capable of and a small glimpse into the buzz around a 18 - year - old coaches at @entity13 believe can become the next @entity96			1
@entity0 already holds the distinction of being the youngest player to turn out for @entity4 , making his senior debut with a nine - minute cameo in a @entity102 tie at @entity103 in september 2012			1
he was a tender 16 years and six days old			0
although that remains @entity0 's one and only senior outing , he has been making great strides at youth team and under 21 level			1
born in @entity110 in september 1996 , @entity0 was a member of the @entity103 academy between the ages of 10 and 14 before being spotted by former @entity4 club scout @entity113			2
@entity0 gets beyond @entity115 's @entity114 in an under 18 @entity117 match last season he spent the 2011 - 2012 campaign mainly with the under 16 side but made a handful of appearances for the under 18 team towards the end			1
his coach @entity125 was impressed by his talent and a 15 - year - old @entity0 was even invited to rub shoulders with the likes of @entity14 and @entity129 at @entity130 , something he later described as a ' great learning curve			1
' it was n't long before @entity0 found his scoring boots , with a prolific pre-season in 2012 leading to a call up into the squad @entity138 was about to lead into the @entity139			2
@entity0 impressed in the first group match away to @entity141 , winning a penalty that @entity143 converted and going close himself on a number of occasions			2
@entity4 were narrowly beaten 3 - 2 in that game but went on to advance from the group , @entity0 scoring his first goal in continental competition in a 4 - 1 win over @entity151			1
@entity0 is challenged by @entity152 of @entity6 in a @entity154 semi-final in april 2013 these appearances came either side of that first team run - out at @entity158 , a moment @entity0 described as a ' dream come true ' in a later interview			1
but things have really taken off for @entity0 this season , with six goals in the group phase of the under 19 @entity21 amongst his haul			2
the youngster has credited another club legend , @entity167 , as a massive influence on his development with his coaching sessions at the club 's @entity130 training ground			0
@entity0 told the @entity173 last week : ' @entity167 is a legend at this club so to get a few helpful tips from him and some advice is brilliant for me			0
@entity0 takes on @entity178 during an under 18 match with @entity115 this season ' this is a guy who has been there and done it and played at the pinnacle of the game			0
it 's fantastic for me to get the chance to work with him and it can only improve my game			0
' he has given me a few little tips on my first touch , and worked with me on different types of finishing			0
he is always there to help me in any way he can			0
' internationally , @entity0 has represented @entity59 at under 16 and under 17 level			0
his debut came in the @entity198 in october 2011 , when @entity199 were beaten 4 - 0			0
his first goals for the @entity59 came at the @entity201 in @entity202 , helping to secure wins against the hosts and also @entity205			0
@entity0 breaks through the @entity207 defence during an under 17s international in @entity209 back in 2012 as shown of late , @entity0 is already a good finisher and has a knack of getting into the right place at the right time to gobble up loose balls			2
he seems strong on both feet when in and around the penalty area and has good placement			0
at 5ft 8in , @entity0 wo n't win a great deal in their air but he has tricky feet and good acceleration too , so he fits in with the fluid passing game the @entity4 academy try to foster			1
and the signs look promising that @entity0 will be the next bright youngster to come through @entity4 's academy ranks .			1

@entity0 scored and won a penalty in @entity229 win over @entity6
his performance drew praise from @entity13 legend @entity14
second - half goal in @entity46 was @entity0 's 22nd of the season
he remains @entity4 's youngest first - team debutant back in 2012
quick and deadly , @entity0 has been compared to @entity96
