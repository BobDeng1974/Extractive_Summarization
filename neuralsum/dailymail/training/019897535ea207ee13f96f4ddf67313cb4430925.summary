this is the first picture of one of two top @entity3 pilots who died within days of each other after complaining about being exposed to toxic oil fumes on passenger planes			1
@entity7 , 43 , died after instructing his lawyers to sue @entity3 for health and safety breaches days before fellow pilot @entity11 , 43 , passed away			1
both claimed they had been poisoned by the fumes that can contaminate cabin air and which regularly force pilots to wear oxygen masks			1
pilot @entity7 , pictured at the controls of an airplane , had instructed his lawyers to sue @entity3 for alleged health and safety breaches mr @entity7 's lawyers want to ' give him the trial he never got ' by suing the airline in a case they say will be a ' moment of truth ' for the aviation industry			1
they say they are on the cusp of proving in court the existence of ' aerotoxic syndrome ' , a chronic physical and neurological condition they insist will one day be seen as ' the new asbestos '			1
thousands of pilots are currently ' unfit to fly ' , one specialist doctor claims			2
official records from the @entity39 show that pilots and crew have to put on their oxygen masks at least five times a week to combat suspected ' fume events '			1
in some cases , crew members have passed out - while passengers have been left in the dark			0
ms @entity11 , one of the most talented pilots of her generation , had begged bosses at @entity3 to address the issue after she was grounded with ill health in 2005 , according to the @entity54			2
in a letter to them in 2006 , she wrote : ' my objective is to get well and carry on flying and not enter a protracted legal battle because of the impact exposure to contaminated air has had on my life but if i have to i will			2
' she later developed cancer however , and did not go ahead with suing @entity3			2
mr @entity7 , a world record - breaking paraglider as well as a commercial pilot , voluntarily grounded himself in 2011 after suffering whiplash in a car crash			0
concerns : both pilots claimed before their deaths that they had been poisoned by fumes in the cockpit aviation medic dr @entity74 said he had by then become concerned about his health and memory , suffering persistent headaches , chronic fatigue , loss of confidence and mood swings			2
dr @entity74 , who himself flew for @entity83 and suffered similar symptoms , said mr @entity7 did not tell his employer because he feared losing his job			0
he sought private medical advice to avoid any blemishes on his health record			0
mr @entity7 , who was not married and had no children , died on december 12 in @entity91 , where he had been having treatment			0
he had been there since last april after diverting to the @entity95 city while on his way to @entity98 suicide clinic @entity97 , having given up all hope of finding a cure			0
@entity101 , a pilot and one of mr @entity7 's lawyers , said @entity3 is liable under the @entity104 to @entity106 regulations because it fails to monitor the quality of air on board planes			1
pilots and crew wear oxygen masks at least five times a week according to the @entity39 despite calls from pilots and the @entity116 , @entity3 and all other airlines do not install air quality detection systems			1
instead , they rely on the results of @entity121 commissioned studies , the most recent of which by @entity124 , @entity125 , concluded in 2011 that cabin air was safe			1
mr @entity101 is now trying to force a groundbreaking @entity128 inquest into @entity7 ’s death in which @entity3 would be asked questions about aerotoxic syndrome			1
he said : ' i see this as an impending tsunami for the airline industry — it ’s been hushed for and ignored for so long			0
we hope to use the inquest to give @entity7 the trial he never got			0
it would be the first judicial recognition of his condition			0
' a spokesman for @entity3 said : ' our thoughts are with the families of the two pilots at this very sad time and we offer our sincere condolences			2
' we are not aware of any legal claims relating to the two individuals			0
' it would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate upon the individuals ' cause of death			0

pilots have to put on oxygen masks up to five times a week
lawyers hope to prove the existence of ' aerotoxic syndrome '
they say the air quality problem will be seen as the ' new asbestos '
@entity3 and all other airlines do not install air quality detection systems
they rely on results of @entity121 commissioned studies
