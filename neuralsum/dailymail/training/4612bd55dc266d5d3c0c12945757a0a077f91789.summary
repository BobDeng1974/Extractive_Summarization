motorists paid out a record £ 1.4 billion in parking charges to councils in @entity4 and were hit by almost £ 1 million per day in parking fines			1
in total car owners forked out £ 160,000 every hour to town halls for parking permits , fines , pay - and - display tickets , and other parking charges			1
the haul includes a staggering £ 343million in parking tickets			2
the new figures show that local authorities made a record profit last year of £ 546million from parking			1
motorists paid out £ 1 million per day in parking fines , @entity21 figures revealed the figures from @entity21 do not include what motorists also paid to park in privately run car parks , so the real impact on drivers would be even higher			1
@entity26 , the government 's @entity27 warned councils not to treat motorists as ' cash cows ' , but it would appear the plea has been ignored by town halls			2
last year 's total parking income haul of £ 1.409billion was a rise of 1.5percent on the £ 1.389billion that @entity4 councils brought in during the previous 12 months			1
however , parking fines were down to £ 343million from £ 353 million the previous year			1
an @entity38 spokesman said : ' looking at these figures it seems clear that the local authority parking gravy train is still running full steam with parking profits up on last year			2
' local authorities continue to squeeze every penny they can from drivers when it comes to parking charges			1
the total parking haul of £ 1.4billion was a rise of 1.5 per cent on the amount brought in during the previous 12 months ' this is despite the fact that town centres are battling with one another and on - line shopping to attract trade especially at this time of year			1
' far from easing off on charges many authorities now charge well into the evening and on sundays deterring many with money in their pocket from visiting some town centres			0
' hopefully some councils may shed their @entity65 like image this @entity67 by giving drivers a break with some free parking to bump up local trade - but make no mistake it may be short - term with civil enforcement officers back on the street to enjoy a post @entity67 sale parking ticket bonanza ! ' of the 20 local authorities that made the most income from parking a total of 13 of them come from @entity81			1
@entity82 hauled in a total of almost £ 81million last year , way ahead of its nearest rival			1

@entity115 ( £ 11.1m ) @entity116 , director of the @entity117 , said : ' drivers are already hit hard by everything from fuel duty to road tax , and profiteering councils taking them for a ride with too - high parking charges will rub salt in the wound			1
' councils should use parking charges purely as a way of funding the maintenance and upkeep of car parks and streets			1
local authorities ca n't use hard - pressed motorists who rely on their cars as a way to fill the coffers , but must instead focus on eliminating waste in other areas			2
' cllr @entity141 , @entity142 at the @entity143 , said : ' these figures prove that councils remain on the side of hard - pressed motorists with parking fines going down and total parking income staying below the rate of inflation over the past 12 months			1
' the reality is that the average motorist is paying 30 times more to @entity153 in charges and taxation each year than they do to their town hall through parking			2
' parking charges and fines are essential to help councils keep traffic flowing and pedestrians and motorists safe			1
on - street parking revenue is spent on paying for parking services			0
any surplus is spent on essential transport projects , such as talking the £ 12 billion roads repair backlog and providing subsidised travel to elderly and disabled residents			2
