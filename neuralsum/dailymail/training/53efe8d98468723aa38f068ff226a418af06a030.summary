my principles and the board ’s principles are not the only thing that matter			0
‘ the influence of mob - like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing @entity6 to train			1
i will acknowledge that our decision to not let @entity53 train is probably a decision that will make it harder for him to get on with his football career			0
‘ the people who believe @entity6 should be punished for the rest of his life might call that a victory			2
i think of it as a defeat for the principle that punishment under the justice system should be left to those that are authorised by law			0
