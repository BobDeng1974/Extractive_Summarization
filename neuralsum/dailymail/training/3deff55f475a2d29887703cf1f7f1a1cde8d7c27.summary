@entity0 fiercely defended @entity1 following a drab performance in - front of a half - empty @entity3			1
@entity4 spared @entity1 's blushes , scoring the winner from the spot on his first appearance as skipper in front of 40,181 spectators - the lowest attendance for an @entity1 match at the revamped @entity3			1
@entity1 managed just two shots on target - one being @entity4 's penalty - all night			1
' two shots ? what about all the ones they threw themselves in front of ... do n't hit me with statistics			2
' when we had that much possession , and you talk about two shots on target ? ' we 're not scoring a lot of goals , but we 're not playing against teams who come out against us a lot			2
this team will score goals			0
' i thought the performance was quite good			0
i was pleased with the first half , we probed well with good movements			0
anger : when told @entity1 only had two shots on target , @entity0 snapped back : ' do n't hit me with statistics ' instruction : @entity1 boss @entity0 has a word with @entity65 during a break in play ' i was disappointed with the start of the second half when we did n't do anything as like as well for the first 15 minutes , but then we changed things , changed the formation slightly , and finished the game strongly			1
' despite the criticism , the @entity1 manager hinted his side are unlikely to show more attacking verve against @entity79 in their opening @entity82 qualifier on monday			1
' @entity79 will need to beat us , if anything , we might be @entity18 on monday , ' said @entity0			1
' we might be pushed back and ca n't attack and dominate for long periods , as we did today			0
' i do n't think the mind - set of the @entity88 team , playing us in @entity89 , will be the same as the mind - set of the @entity92			0
' wasteful : @entity1 only registered two shots on target despite dominating possession against @entity18 @entity96 : @entity97 has an effort on goal during another lacklustre performance from @entity1 @entity101 , who won the winning penalty , was a rare bright spot on a mediocre night for @entity1			2
@entity101 added to his growing reputation as one of @entity107 's premier young players with a superb display , deservedly winning the man of the match award			0
the @entity111 forward started the game on the left , but switched to a central position in the second half where he looked dangerous			0
and manager @entity0 , who revealed @entity117 has returned to @entity118 with a calf injury , admits he may consider playing @entity101 through the middle against @entity79			2
' when @entity101 moved into the centre he showed the full range of his dribbling ability , so it 's nice to know we have these options and wo n't be totally restricted to one way of playing			0
' all smiles : @entity4 is congratulated after scoring the winner for @entity1 in his first match as captain well played , captain : @entity4 shakes hands with manager @entity0 after being substituted at @entity3			1

@entity1 beat @entity18 1 - 0 thanks to captain @entity4 's penalty
just 40,181 fans attended , the lowest since new @entity3 was opened
@entity1 managed just two shots on target during the whole *90* minutes
@entity0 angrily defends players , saying ' do n't hit me with statistics '
@entity1 boss says @entity1 had plenty of possession but played against a @entity18 side who were willing to just sit back and *invite* *pressure*
@entity0 suggested @entity1 will play like @entity18 against @entity79
@entity1 travel to @entity79 in their first @entity82 qualifier on monday
