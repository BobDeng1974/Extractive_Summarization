by @entity0 it is the nearest there has ever been a nightclub on another planey			0
@entity5 today revealed video footage showing its @entity7 firing lasers on the red planet			0
the @entity11 laser instrument has zapped more than 600 rock and soil targets on @entity14 since @entity7 landed in the planet 's @entity15 in august 2012 - but this is the first time the process has been seen			1
preliminary analysis of the @entity11 spectra from this target rock , appropriately named ' @entity32 , ' indicates a composition rich in silicon , aluminum and sodium , beneath a dust layer poor in those elements			1
this is typical of rocks that @entity7 is encountering on its way toward @entity42			0
the flashes appear on a baseball - size @entity14 rock in a series of images taken on saturday by the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) camera on the arm of @entity5 's @entity7			1
the flashes occurred while the rover 's @entity22 ( @entity11 ) instrument fired multiple laser shots to investigate the rock 's composition			1
' this is so exciting ! the @entity11 laser has fired more than 150,000 times on @entity14 , but this is the first time we see the plasma plume that is created , ' said @entity11 deputy principal investigator @entity59 , at the @entity60 in @entity61 and @entity62 , of @entity64 's @entity63 and the @entity65 , @entity64			1
' each time the laser hits a target , the plasma light is caught and analyzed by @entity11 's spectrometers			1
@entity5 's @entity7 used the camera on its arm to catch the first images of sparks produced by the rover 's laser being shot at a rock on @entity14			1
the left image is from before the laser zapped this rock , called " @entity32			2
" the spark is at the center of the right image			0
' what the new images add is confirmation that the size and shape of the spark are what we anticipated under @entity14 conditions			2
' preliminary analysis of the @entity11 spectra from this target rock , appropriately named ' @entity32 , ' indicates a composition rich in silicon , aluminum and sodium , beneath a dust layer poor in those elements			2
this is typical of rocks that @entity7 is encountering on its way toward @entity42			0
under attack : a martian target rock called ' @entity32 , ' shown here , displayed an increasing concentration of aluminum as a series of laser shots from @entity5 's @entity7 penetrated through dust on the rock 's surface			0
this pattern is typical of many rocks examined with the rover 's laser - firing @entity11			2
@entity48 deputy principal investigator @entity116 of the @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , said , ' one of the reasons we took these images is that they allow the @entity11 folks to compare the plume to those they imaged on @entity126			0
' also , @entity48 has captured images of other activities of @entity7 , for documentation purposes , and this was an opportunity to document the laser in action .			0

the @entity11 laser instrument has zapped more than 600 rock and soil targets on @entity14
video is the first time the process has been seen
