former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 seemed to be struggling with his maths on tuesday night			2
the 23 - year - old asked on @entity4 : ‘ if @entity1 win 2 - 0 they go through ? ’ no , afraid not , @entity0			1
@entity1 officially had 1,200 fans in the @entity7 — but an estimated 5,000 were in the 18,000 crowd with @entity9 having put the tickets on general sale			1
despite their renaissance , the @entity12 , with a population of 38,000 , unsurprisingly struggles to fill the stadium , even on big @entity17 nights			0
five thousand @entity1 supporters packed in to the @entity7 for their tie against @entity9 on tuesday it perhaps should come as no surprise that a tax haven inhabited by the super rich should lack passion — but it was difficult to avoid the comparison with the ferocious atmosphere of @entity28 ’s @entity27 , the other venue hosting a @entity31 fixture on tuesday night			1
@entity9 ’s @entity7 stadium had all the intensity of a yacht club soiree			2
this was @entity37 ’s first win as a manager against @entity9			0
he had previously drawn four and lost three			0
despite @entity39 , @entity40 and the edge all of @entity43 fame , watching the game from the stands , @entity37 and his side still could n’t find what they were looking for in @entity17 @entity39 ( right ) , @entity40 ( centre ) and the @entity41 were in @entity9 for the @entity31 showdown			0

@entity0 , the @entity1 old boy , *posted* the *question* on @entity4
he appeared confused by the away goals rule in @entity31
@entity1 won 2 - 0 at @entity9 , but failed to *progress* after *miserable* first *leg*
five thousand @entity1 supporters were estimated to be in @entity7
