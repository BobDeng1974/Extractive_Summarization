by @entity0 the giants of the technology world have revealed just how often they hand over information to the government on their users - and it runs into the tens of thousands			1
freed by a recent legal deal with government lawyers , the major technology firms revealed for the first time how often they are ordered to turn over customer information for secret national security investigations			1
the publications disclosed by @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 provided expanded details and some vented criticism about the government 's handling of customers ' internet data in counter-terrorism and other intelligence - related probes			1
freed by a recent legal deal with government lawyers , major technology firms released new data on how often they are ordered to turn over customer information for secret national security investigations the figures from 2012 and 2013 showed that companies , such as @entity15 and @entity16 , were compelled by the government to provide information on as many as 10,000 customer accounts in a six - month period			1
@entity17 complied with government requests for information on more than 40,000 accounts in the same period			1
the companies earlier provided limited information about government requests for data , but a new agreement reached last week with the @entity50 administration allowed the firms to provide a broadened , though still circumscribed , set of figures to the public			1
seeking to reassure customers and business partners alarmed by revelations about the government 's massive collection of @entity61 and computer data , the firms stressed details indicating that only small numbers of their customers were targeted by authorities			1
still , even those small numbers showed that thousands of @entity68 were affected by the government requests approved by judges of the secret @entity71			0
the data releases by the five major tech firms offered a mix of dispassionate graphics , reassurances and protests , seeking to alleviate customer concerns about government spying while pressuring national security officials about the companies ' constitutional concerns			1
the shifting tone in the releases showed the precarious course that major tech firms have had to navigate in recent months , caught between their public commitments to internet freedom and their enforced roles as data providers to @entity68 spy agencies			1
in a company blog post , @entity16 general counsel @entity92 scolded the @entity68 and allied governments for failing to renounce the reported mass interception of @entity61 data carried by communications cables			1
@entity15 is one of the firms to reveal the number of @entity102 request it receives the new figures were released just a week after major tech firms announced a legal agreement with the @entity105			1
the companies can only reveal how many total requests they receive every six months , with the numbers in groupings of 1,000			0
and even those general numbers must be concealed for at least six months after any reporting period ends			0
that restriction means the @entity102 requests for the final half of last year ca n't be shared until july , at the earliest			0
top lawyers and executives for major tech firms had previously raised alarms about media reports describing that hacking by @entity68 and @entity120 spy agencies and cited them during conversations with @entity68 officials during president @entity50 's internal review of planned changes to the government 's spying operations			1
' despite the president 's reform efforts and our ability to publish more information , there has not yet been any public commitment by either the @entity68 or other governments to renounce the attempted hacking of @entity61 companies , ' @entity92 said in a @entity16 blog release			1
@entity92 added that @entity16 planned to press the government ' for more on this point , in collaboration with others across our industry			1
' the new figures were released just a week after major tech firms announced a legal agreement with the @entity105			1
but lawyers and executive for the companies openly vented their discomfort with the government 's continuing insistence that they could only provide broad ranges instead of the actual numbers of government requests			0
the companies said they would press for narrower data ranges that would offer more details			2
' we will also continue to advocate for still narrower disclosure ranges , which will provide a more accurate picture of the number of national security - related requests , ' said @entity162 , @entity19 's general counsel			1
a spokesman for the @entity164 declined to comment on the companies ' releases and comments			0
the spokesman pointed to a late january statement by @entity164 @entity169 and attorney general @entity170 that said the agreement would allow the firms to ' disclose more information than ever before to their customers			1
' @entity15 and all the other companies denied that they gave any government unfettered access to their users ' info			2
the companies are worried more people will reduce their online activities if they believe almost everything they do is being monitored by the government			0
a decline in web surfing could hurt the companies financially by giving them fewer opportunities to show online ads and sell other services			0
@entity17 listed the highest number of people swept up in @entity102 requests for online content during the first half of last year			2
the orders seeking user content spanned 30,000 to 30,999 accounts , according to the @entity203 requested content could have included emails , instant messages , address books , calendar items and pictures			0
the companies can only reveal how many total requests they receive every six months , with the numbers in groupings of 1,000			0
and even those general numbers must be concealed for at least six months after any reporting period ends			0
that restriction means the @entity102 requests for the final half of last year ca n't be shared until july , at the @entity217 data coming out monday indicated the @entity68 government is digging deeper into the internet as people spend more time @entity224 of the companies showed the number of government requests fell between 0 and 999 for each six - month period			2
but the numbers of customers affected by those searches ranged more @entity232 , for instance , has seen the number of people affected by @entity102 court orders rise from 2,000 to 2,999 users during the first half of 2009 to between 9,000 and 9,999 users during the first half of last year			0
the company showed an unusual spike in the number of @entity68 whose data was collected between july and december 2012			2
during that period , metadata was collected from between 12,000 and 12,999 users			0
under the restrictions imposed by the government , no explanation was provided for that anomaly			0
@entity17 listed the highest number of people swept up in @entity102 requests for online content during the first half of last year			2
in a company blog post , @entity16 general counsel @entity92 scolded the @entity68 and allied governments for failing to renounce the reported mass interception of @entity61 data carried by communications cables			1
the orders seeking user content spanned 30,000 to 30,999 accounts , according to the company			0
the requested content could have included emails , instant messages , address books , calendar items and pictures			0
all the companies also received @entity102 requests that were n't aimed at scooping up online communications or photos			0
those demands sought things such as billing information and locations of where people made an internet connection			2
@entity15 described monday 's disclosure as a positive step while promising to keep fighting for the right to provide more precise numbers about the @entity102 requests and more specifics about the data being sought			1
' we still believe more transparency is needed so everyone can better understand how surveillance laws work and decide whether or not they serve the public interest , ' @entity287 , @entity15 's legal director of law enforcement and information security , wrote in a blog post			1
even if the companies can share more information about the @entity102 requests , they still might face doubts raised by other @entity302 documents leaked by former @entity302 contractor @entity303 asserting that @entity68 government has found ways to tap into the lines transmitting personal information between data centers			2
the companies are trying to thwart the hacking by encrypting most , if not all the data , stored on their computers			2
' the limited information that can be gleaned from the reports suggests that the government is using its spying powers extremely broadly , likely infringing on the privacy rights of many innocent @entity68 , ' said @entity318 , a staff attorney with the @entity319			2
meanwhile , a conservative lawyer who has challenged the constitutionality of the @entity302 's daily collection of phone data said he had filed a petition with the @entity68 @entity325 to step in and review his case			0
attorney @entity327 said he had mailed a petition to the top court asking it to intervene in the case , which is already under appeal			0
judge @entity332 , the presiding @entity68 district judge in the case , ruled last december that the @entity302 program had constitutional flaws			0
@entity332 has held off shutting the program down pending court appeals .			0

recent legal ruling allowed the information to be revealed for the first time
@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 have all released their data
