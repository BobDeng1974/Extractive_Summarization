but he added : ' there is still a long way to go and we know it will be difficult			0
we have to make the most of the advantage we now have			0
but we know we ca n't relax especially against a rival as strong as @entity30			0
' @entity106 coach @entity105 praised @entity0 saying : ‘ he finished the goal like very few players can			1
he is a striker who can score goals like this , but he is also technical enough to play the football we play and physical enough to compliment the other players in the side			0
we signed him for nights like this			0
’ the game looked to be slipping away from @entity7 after they were made to suffer in the first half			2
@entity105 admitted : ‘ the goal calmed us down a lot in the second half			1
it ’s a big a win against our eternal rival but we have a lot of difficult games to go before the league is won			0
' the win means more because this is a very good @entity30 side			2
’ until @entity0 struck the night had belonged to @entity47 , who responded to a week of global adulation for @entity52 by equalising in the first half to silence the @entity3 after @entity58 opened the scoring			1
@entity47 ’s every touch was booed — even from his first run down the left inside 60 seconds			0
it only took @entity52 10 minutes to mark up his first nutmeg , sending the ball through @entity78 ’ legs , but it was real with a pumped - up @entity47 who made much of the early running and he hit the bar from @entity48 ’s cross			1
at the other end , @entity13 and @entity0 clashed and @entity7 were awarded a free - kick			1
@entity52 took it and , powering in ahead of @entity12 , @entity58 headed past @entity15 for his first @entity7 goal			1
the hosts should have doubled their lead but @entity65 made a mess of a @entity0 assist and they paid the price as @entity30 scored with their next attack			1
@entity76 played the ball to @entity48 , the @entity154 ’s flick found @entity47 in space and he swept the ball past @entity56			2
@entity0 was booked for leaving his foot in on @entity13 , who had already gone in late on the @entity159			0
@entity58 headed @entity7 into the lead at the @entity3 with 19 minutes played in the @entity42 showdown the @entity154 got in front of @entity30 defender @entity12 to head his team into the lead at the @entity3 @entity30 goalkeeper @entity15 watches on as @entity58 's header in the 19th minute finds the back of his net @entity58 celebrates with his @entity7 team - mates after giving his team the lead in @entity5 @entity47 and @entity57 challenge for the ball in the air while @entity60 attempts to hold off @entity81 in the area as @entity47 watches on @entity7 were hanging on before half - time and @entity81 thought he had scored from @entity47 ’s flicked header — only for the goal to be disallowed because the @entity177 was offside			1
five minutes into the second half @entity48 almost put real ahead after a fine move but was somehow denied by @entity56			0

@entity65 should have scored it twice but both times shot wide , with @entity0 better placed on the first occasion			2
@entity0 could also have scored again wriggling away from @entity73 only to pull his shot wide			2
@entity30 kept going forward and as with the very first chance of the second period @entity48 was denied by @entity56			0
@entity203 then steamed through on to a @entity52 pass only for the ball to be cleared for a corner			0
from the kick @entity0 sent a shot high over @entity15 ’ bar			1
it now seemed as if @entity7 were chasing the late goal and the @entity98 keeper again saved from @entity52			2
@entity0 restored @entity7 's lead early in the second half with a clinical finish past @entity15 into the bottom corner @entity30 goalkeeper @entity15 was left with no chance by the @entity7 striker 's clinical finish into the bottom corner @entity159 striker @entity0 celebrates scoring @entity7 's second goal to give them the lead again in @entity5 @entity0 celebrates his first goal in @entity5 since moving to @entity98 from @entity94 in the summer of 2014 there were 11 bookings on the night and @entity62 and @entity47 clattered into each other midway through the second half			1
but the game was more ' crash bang wallop ' than containing any of the bad blood of previous meetings			0
@entity0 thrives in games this frenetic and in that sense it was no surprise his contribution was decisive			1
he may even have decided the title race			1
@entity30 coach @entity236 said : ‘ the league is more difficult now			0
we have to keep going and play as we did in the first half for 90 minutes			0
i do n’t think we made any mistakes when you have @entity0 against you then he can do that			0
he finds the space and when the right pass comes he can finish			0
our heads are down but we still have a lot to play for			0
