a nine - year - old boy had part of his skull transplanted into his stomach for three weeks , as part of a pioneering new operation to save his life			1
@entity7 was severely injured when he was knocked off his bike by a car			1
as part of his treatment , surgeons removed a section of his skull and implanted it in his stomach for ' safe - keeping '			1
the surgery was necessary to relieve pressure after @entity19 's brain became so swollen it was putting his life at risk			1
paediatric neurological surgeons @entity22 and @entity24 performed the operation at @entity26			2
they gently removed the skin from @entity19 's forehead just above the eye line , then cut out a section of skull bigger than a adult 's hand to help alleviate the pressure			1
@entity7 , nine , was badly injured when he was knocked off his bike by a car			1
surgeons removed part of his skull , implanting it into his stomach for ' safe - keeping ' to relieve pressure on his brain after 17 days in hospital paediatric neuro - surgeons at @entity26 replaced the piece of skull			1
the bone is stored in the abdomen because it is a sterile environment and lessens the chance it will be rejected by the body when it is reattached once it was removed the team created a pocket in the year five pupil 's stomach and kept the pieces of bone there for 18 days until he had recovered sufficiently to have it replaced by consultant paediatric neurosurgeon @entity24			1
the unusual procedure is known as a bi-frontal decompressive craniectomy and insertion of bone flap into anterior abdominal wall			0
mr @entity22 said : ' it 's an elegant solution , particularly in children			2
' obviously you ca n't have someone without the bone in the long term			0
but we had to store the bone somewhere			0
' in the past we used to put it in a medical freezer or use a tin plate which is custom built			2
' there is a reasonably large pocket in the tummy			0
the magical thing about that is it is a sterile environment , it wo n't be rejected by the body and it is very straight forward to go back and take the bone out			1
' the operation was a complete success and @entity19 was discharged from the hospital three days later			1
mr @entity22 said that @entity83 was back to his old self and added : ' he looks brilliant			1
' the nine - year - old was on his way to a football match after school when he was struck by a car			1
he jumped on to a bike to catch up with friends , but did n't realise his brakes were n't working			0
he careered out into the road and into the path of a silver @entity95			0
witnesses described seeing @entity83 hit the car 's windscreen head first before being catapulted 15ft into the air before landing unconscious in the road			1
his mother @entity101 said the impact of her son 's head had cracked the car 's windscreen			1
@entity24 and @entity22 performed the unusual procedure , known as a bi-frontal decompressive craniectomy , at @entity26 ' he jumped on a bike but did n't know there were no brakes on it , ' she said			0
' he had his hands on the brakes and tried to stop the bike , but could n't stop it and went straight into the road			0
he was at full throttle			0
' emergency services rushed to the scene in @entity26 and @entity83 was taken by ambulance to @entity26			2
there he was passed to mr @entity22 , who has worked at the hospital for two years			0
after suffering a head injury in the crash doctors noticed a build up of pressure on @entity19 's brain			1
after attempting to reduce the swelling by putting the nine - year - old into a medically induced coma , specialists decided to attempt the unusual procedure a bi-frontal decompressive craniectomy and insertion of bone flap into anterior abdominal wall			2
paediatric neurological surgeons @entity22 and @entity24 performed the operation at @entity26			0
they gently removed the skin from @entity19 's forehead just above the eye line , then cut out a section of skull bigger than a adult 's hand to help alleviate the pressure			1
once it was removed the team created a pocket in the year five pupil 's stomach and kept the pieces of bone there for 18 days until he had recovered sufficiently to have it replaced by consultant paediatric neurosurgeon mr @entity24			1
the consultant knew immediately that @entity83 had a ' very , very nasty injury ' which was causing pressure to build up in his brain because of the swelling caused by the serious bruising			1
' it was life and death , ' said the surgeon			0
' the skull stops the pressure being relieved , hence pressure in the head rises , stopping blood coming into the brain and eventually you will die			1
' @entity83 was going in and out of consciousness - he was on the brink of going into a coma			1
' the schoolboy was immediately given medication to ease the swelling but the next day mr @entity22 hooked the youngster up to breathing apparatus and put him into a medically - induced comma to relax the brain and help ease the pressure			1
his team then performed an image - guided insertion of an external ventricular drain , where they tried to insert a tiny tube into the brain to drain the fluid out			2
although the procedure was a success , the football - mad youngster did not show signs of recovering			0
' despite the procedure , the pressure was still unacceptably high , ' said mr @entity22			0
' in those situations you only have one option and that is to remove a very large amount of bone from his skull			0
' he removed a section of @entity83 's skull , implanting it into the nine - year - old 's stomach , a sterile environment that prevents the body from rejecting the bone			1
the @entity215 football fan spent a total of 17 days in hospital , but his time there was brightened up when his big brother @entity220 , 18 , managed to get his hero and @entity215 captain , @entity223 , to send @entity83 a get well soon card			1
today all that remains of @entity19 's ordeal is a long red scar hidden by his hair line			2
he is back at school but has to wait for a year before he can get back on the football pitch his mother @entity101 said : ' he got the letter from @entity223 wishing him well and telling him to get well soon and that made him really happy			2
' he is @entity215 all the way - he has @entity235 and @entity236 printed on his wall			0
' now , three months after the operation @entity19 is back at school and life is returning to almost normal - the young striker can not play football for a year until he gets the all clear from the hospital			1
' he has had to quit football for a year and @entity19 is very upset about that , ' said @entity101			2
' he has been on trial with different clubs and had only just started with @entity248			0
' he is really worried about going back			0
he loves playing football - he is very good			0
the 38 - year - old mother - of - three thanked the team at the hospital , which specialises in children 's neurosurgery , for returning her son to health			2
' i am just so happy he is alive , ' she said			0
' i wake up every day and praise @entity258 and the surgeons			0
' i had a lot of worries but now i worry about different things like being the perfect mum , making sure he is not in danger , making sure he is safe			0
' today all that remains of @entity267 's ordeal is a long red scar underneath his hairline showing where part of his skull was temporarily removed			2
' the miracle was that there were no other injuries , ' said @entity101 at the family home in @entity276 , @entity26			0
' at the hospital they prepared me for lots of horrible things - they said it could take six months to a year before he was ready to leave			2
' every mother prays for their child but i feel i had the @entity285 tattooed to my brain			0
' i slept in the chapel at the hospital most nights - it was quite an ordeal			2
' it 's changed me so much as a person			0
