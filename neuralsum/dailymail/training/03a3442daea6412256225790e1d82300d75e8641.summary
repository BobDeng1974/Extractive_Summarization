@entity0 has made a surprise appearance in an image taken by the world 's most powerful digital camera			1
the comet sprung up in a photo snapped taken by the 570 - megapixel @entity7 as it was scanning the southern sky			1
at the time this image was taken , the comet was passing about 51 million miles ( 82 million km ) from @entity10			1
it appeared as a burst of green light against sky full of stars			0

each of the rectangles represents one of the 62 individual fields of the camera ' it reminds us that before we can look out beyond our galaxy to the far reaches of the universe , we need to watch out for celestial objects that are much closer to home , ' wrote the team on the @entity37 blog			0
the @entity7 is sensitive to light up to eight billion light years away , and so was able to capture the view in incredible detail			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) is designed to find out why the expansion of the universe is speeding up , instead of slowing down due to gravity			1
it is currently looking into the mystery of dark energy , the force believed to be causing that acceleration			0
he comet 's centre is a ball of ice roughly three miles ( 5 km ) across , and the visible head of the comet is a cloud of gas and dust about 400,000 miles ( 640,000 km ) in diameter			1
pictured is a shot taken by an amateur astronomer earlier this year @entity0 was first spotted by @entity63 @entity62 on august 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world			2

the comet 's distinctive green glow comes from molecules of diatomic carbon - two carbon atoms joined together - and cyanogen fluorescing in the ultraviolet light from the sun. its tail takes on a blue tinge due to the carbon monoxide it contains			0
@entity0 was first spotted by @entity63 @entity62 , who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers , and he named the comet			2
to date , mr @entity62 , from @entity90 , has discovered five comets , all using relatively simple equipment compared to what 's found at a professional observatory			0

comets are essentially piles of rock , gravel , and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice			0
as the comet nears the sun , its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight			0
they also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the @entity10 's orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers the comet 's distinctive green glow comes from molecules of diatomic carbon - two carbon atoms joined together - and cyanogen fluorescing in the ultraviolet light from the @entity142 tail takes on a blue tinge due to the carbon monoxide it contains			1
