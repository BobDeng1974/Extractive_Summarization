former @entity1 gov. @entity0 once knocked president @entity2 as being too ' preoccupied with other matters ' to confront @entity4 , an email from @entity0 's time in office that was released today reveals			1
in the january 1999 email , obtained and published by the @entity10 along with other correspondence from @entity0 's eight years in office , @entity1 's newly elected chief executive took a shot at embattled @entity2 over his affair with @entity15 intern @entity14 and suggested that the next president should be more bold with the communist country			1
' forceful diplomacy can make a difference and we have had none for the last seven years and the current president is preoccupied with other matters , ' @entity0 said in an email to then - rep. @entity25 of @entity1			1
@entity0 , left , is sworn in as governor of @entity1 by @entity1 chief justice @entity28 , right , as @entity0 's wife @entity29 holds the @entity31 and their son @entity32 , left , looks on in this jan 5 , 1999 photo , @entity26 released emails from @entity0 's first days in office show a hard - working executive who took time to answer constituent emails but was concerned that his communications might one day be released , just as they have been all in the family : @entity0 is pictured here in october on his son @entity42 's campaign bus during an interview in @entity45 , @entity46			1
at the time @entity32 was running for commissioner of @entity46 's @entity48 , a position he was elected to , and @entity0 was merely mulling the presidential run he is now actively exploring at that time @entity0 's older brother , @entity32 , was competing in the @entity53 primary for president but he had not yet beat out fellow contender and @entity57 sen. @entity56 for the party 's nomination			1
@entity60 would go on to win the 2000 general election with the help of his brother 's home state of @entity1			2
and as predicted by @entity0 , he did in fact take a harder line with @entity4 than his predecessor @entity2			1
when it was @entity0 's name on the ballot again , @entity32 came to @entity1 , which boasts the largest @entity4 - @entity72 population in the country , and promised to veto any legislation proposing to lift the embargo on @entity4 and then - president @entity77 's regime			1
fast forward 15 years , and now it 's @entity0 who is in the hot seat over the @entity72 ' relationship with @entity4 as he considers competing for the presidency himself next year			1
a day after @entity0 said he would ' actively explore ' a bid for higher office , president @entity82 announced a shift in @entity72 policy toward @entity4 and called for an end on the 53 - year - embargo that restricts trade and travel with the country			1
@entity0 immediately reprimanded @entity82 , calling the decision to resume high - level diplomatic relations with the country a ' misstep ' and ' another dramatic overreach of his executive authority			1
' ' it undermines @entity72 â€™s credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic @entity4 , ' he said in a statement posted to @entity100			0
' @entity4 is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record , and now president @entity82 has rewarded those dictators			0
we should instead be fostering efforts that will truly lead to the fair , legitimate democracy that will ultimately prevail in @entity4			0
' at an event hosted by the @entity109 earlier in the month , before word broke of the @entity82 administration 's secret talks with @entity4 president @entity113 , @entity0 argued that the embargo , which contains several loopholes , should be tightened , if anything			2
' i would argue that instead of lifting the embargo we should consider strengthening it again to put pressure on the @entity4 regime , ' he said , providing a glimpse of his foreign policy style			0

@entity0 could be the third @entity0 to hold higher office in the last three decades if he wins the 2016 general election the emails published today by the @entity10 show another side of @entity0 : a hard - working executive who personally responded to online correspondence directed to him but was wary of leaving behind a permanent trail of unflattering communications			1
in one message , dated december 1999 , @entity0 reportedly warned aides that they may not want to have a conversation about vacation time over email it ' might make a newspaper one of these days			2
he went on to say , ' i suggest that you guys have a verbal conversation about it rather than create a public document			0
: ) ' in it 's review of the emails spanning from 1999 to 2007 the @entity10 says it found that @entity0 often responded to constituents who emailed him , including one woman who asked him for his wife 's birthday			2
another time @entity0 directed a staffer to look into a man 's plea for help in a personal matter			2
' what should have been a messy divorce , seems to have turned into a criminal matter ; with me in the middle , ' the man wrote , describing two friends ' divorce			0
@entity0 could n't resist responding facetiously to another man who emailed him to complain that ' politicians make me sick , you make me sick			2
' to him @entity0 said , ' i am truly sorry you feel that way			0
have a nice day ' with a smiley face at the end of the message			0
the set of emails , available to the public through @entity1 's open records act , were set to be released by @entity0 in the coming weeks as a show of transparency			1
the @entity10 sped up the process on wednesday and published excepts of the more meaty messages			0
while mostly mundane , the emails obtained and released by the @entity10 did unearth one political liability for @entity0 : concerns that he is n't conservative enough			0
early in his tenure @entity0 handled his own hate mail as his administration had not yet created a process to flag and respond to such messages			0
the recently elected governor passed on at least one angry email to his advisers that characterized his as ' no conservative			0
' that was years before @entity0 would come out in favor of national educational standards known as @entity210 and comprehensive immigration reform , two issues that conservatives have used as a cudgel against him			0
since @entity0 affirmed his presidential aspirations , current and former aides have come to defense of his record as governor , pointing to his rejection of a high speed rail project of $ 2 billion in new spending during his tenure and $ 19 billion in tax cuts .			0

' forceful diplomacy can make a difference and we have had none for the last seven years , ' @entity0 said of then - president @entity2
correspondence from @entity0 's eight years in office as @entity1 's governor released today shows a hard - working executive
he personally responded to online correspondence directed to him but was wary of leaving behind a permanent trail of unflattering communications
@entity0 was already planning to publish the correspondence himself as a show of transparency as he prepares to run for president
