vital statistics it 's all about location here - and design			0
overseen to within an inch of its life by @entity35 , you 'll find plenty of his trademark white , undulating design but with a @entity41 bossa - nova touch for warmth - tree trunks act as bedside tables , there 's some eclectic modern furniture and rich browns and gold tones thrown in			1
there are just 89 much sought - after rooms , all stuffed with high - tech designer touches			1
when the sun is out , however , everyone heads to the roof and its white marble swimming pool and bar , and ensconces themselves on the sunloungers - although the hotel does have a private area on the beach as well			2
in vogue : @entity62 of @entity22 takes a dip in the hotel 's pool and , right , @entity66 soaks up the sun perfect spot : step out on to your balcony and you 'll be rewarded with views along @entity74 beach keeping it low key : @entity24 was another famous guest who stayed at the hotel during the @entity20 now the owner of four hotels in @entity81 , the @entity6 family started their empire with a famously good restaurant , and food still matters here			1
while the hotel specialises in @entity87 - style seafood , @entity23 ordered a huge number of burgers - then asked that they were given to her fans camped outside the hotel			2
@entity95 left and you 'll reach @entity97 , but @entity74 is smaller , safer and , more importantly , hipper			0
step out on to your balcony ( and everyone does , even members of @entity22 and @entity23 ) and you 'll be rewarded with views along the beach and into the mountains			2
@entity23 made her sentiments clear by hanging an ' i love @entity7 ' banner on her balcony			0
@entity24 preferred a more low - key approach , slipping into the hotel quietly			1
the rooms on the lower floors can be noisy			0
making a splash : the @entity6 has become the most stylish address in @entity7 style and substance : @entity118 interior designer @entity35 is behind the hotel 's wood and glass decor key attraction @entity7 's coolest hotel by far , with a steady stream of celebrities wanting to experience its charms			1
above all , they come for the rooftop that 's reserved for hotel guests - @entity22 spent most of their free time here			1
a chance to see the sun set is an excuse for a nightly pool party			0
however , unlike many fashionable hotels , the @entity6 prides itself on getting service right - it 's very much down - to - earth			0
all guests are given a pair of flip - flops on arrival to get them into the @entity144 vibe			0
star gazing : @entity23 has sayed at the hotel , and , right , @entity146 - aka @entity146 - admires the view from his balcony at the resort rooftop with a view : the infinity pool at the top of the @entity156 hotel looks out over @entity94 in the news @entity17 holed up here for the @entity20 during the summer			1
@entity22 brought @entity74 to a standstill in may when they stayed			2
good enough for the rest of @entity162 ? even if you ca n't afford a room , non-residents can book in for an albeit expensive meal at the @entity168 restaurant or have a drink at the @entity170 - a little bit of @entity172 in @entity81 , with leather sofas , @entity174 and very strong caipirinhas			0
getting there rooms start from £ 239 per night with @entity178 and mrs @entity179 ( mrandmrssmith.com ) .			1
