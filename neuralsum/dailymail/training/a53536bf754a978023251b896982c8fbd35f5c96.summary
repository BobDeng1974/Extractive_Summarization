@entity5 is now investigating a ‘ cluster ’ of cases of deadly @entity8 , it was confirmed last night the two patients who died were killed by underlying conditions , @entity17 said , but tested positive for the @entity8 bug			1
the 14 patients still fighting it have been placed in isolation and infection control procedures are being followed			1
@entity23 , executive nurse director at @entity17 , said : ‘ we have identified a cluster of @entity8 at the hospital and an investigation is ongoing to establish if there is a link between the cases			1
‘ as is usual practice , we isolate symptomatic patients , emphasise the importance of infection control precautions and undertake additional cleaning			0
we always act as if cases are linked and implement action to prevent cross-transmission			0
‘ our robust surveillance procedures meant that we were able to identify these cases quickly and take the appropriate action			0
’ @entity8 is a bacterium found naturally in the gut which does not cause any problems in healthy people			2
but antibiotics used to treat hospital patients can disrupt the balance of ‘ good ’ bacteria , causing severe diarrhoea and fever			2
