@entity2 ' stock has plummeted in the intervening months , with the @entity28 sitting 10th having already lost seven times , but @entity0 believes a sense of perspective helps his case			1
' he 's got his question marks now but in the grand scheme of things he 's a good coach , ' @entity0 said			2
' i think overall @entity2 's done very , very well , it 's just that the demands from last season , going so high , are seemingly making what 's happening now look nowhere near as good as before , ' he said			2
' but if you look historically they were middle - ish , having a look at the top then dropping away a little			0
