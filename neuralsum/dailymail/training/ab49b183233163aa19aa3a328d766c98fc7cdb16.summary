by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 14 august 2013 a team of ‘ gastronauts ’ have spent the past four months living in a small dome on a barren @entity5 lava field , trying to find out what foods astronauts might eat on a mission to @entity9			1
they emerged yesterday with their recipes and without the space suits they were required to wear each time they ventured onto the northern slope of @entity17 - an active volcano that last erupted in 1984			2
the group of six had been working as part of a $ 1 million @entity23 ( @entity22 ) project on an isolated slope of a @entity26 volcano			0
a team of six researchers have spent the past four months living in a small dome on a barren @entity5 lava field , trying to find out what foods astronauts might eat on a mission to @entity9			1
they emerged yesterday with their results the aim of the project , funded by @entity39 ’s @entity38 , the @entity40 and @entity41 , was to learn about living and cooking for long - duration space missions			2
in between other research projects , the team cooked up meals that were divided between freeze - dried food and meals they were able to cook themselves from the food available at the time			1
team commander @entity54 said the problem with ingredients that are not perishable is they 're usually highly processed and lack fibre			2
he added that he was impressed with how freeze dried products taste very similar to fresh produce			0
but what is also important for future space missions is comfort food , he said			1
a favourite among the crew was nutella , the chocolate - hazelnut spread			2
‘ it 's something we craved , ’ he said			1
‘ we had a limited supply so we had to ration it			0
’ a favourite among the crew was nutella , the chocolate - hazelnut spread , and sweet cakes the study included an open call for recipes that involved a lot of @entity82			1
the canned meat , popular in @entity5 households , was a common ingredient in suggested recipes because of its shelf - life , said @entity88 , a @entity89 associate professor who is an investigator on the study but did n't live in the habitat			1
the researchers prepared several dishes using @entity82 , including a @entity95 jambalaya and a fried rice noodle dish			2
@entity97 was also popular with the researchers almost instantly running out of the ingredient			0
according to @entity23 , longer space exploration in the future , namely missions to @entity9 in the 2030s , present the new challenge of providing food systems to support years - long journeys			1
the team cooked up meals that were divided between freeze - dried food and meals they were able to cook themselves from the food available at the time			1
pancakes were a popular choice canned meat was a common ingredient in suggested recipes for the team because of its shelf - life ‘ we ’re looking at how much of the food for a @entity9 surface mission should be processed packaged food systems versus a bio-regenerative food system , which is growing fresh fruits and vegetables , ’ said @entity120 , @entity121 scientist at @entity39			1
on a mission to @entity9 , astronauts may be able to grow their own food as well as bring along raw ingredients that they can make into tofu , bread , pasta , and flour			1
‘ they may make a meal with fresh pasta with a pasta sauce made from a tomato and green onions and bell peppers in the garden and then maybe make bread from the flour also			0
maybe even have cookies at the end of the meal , ’ ms @entity120 said			0
however , there are several challenges to feeding a hungry crew in space			0
the food needs a five - year shelf life and enough variety to stay interesting			1
ms @entity120 has collaborated with @entity157 , associate professor of biological and environmental engineering , to research why astronauts lose their sense of taste in space			0
in low gravity more body fluids shift to the head , affecting the sense of smell			0
according to @entity23 , longer space exploration in the future , namely missions to @entity9 in the 2030s , present the new challenge of providing food systems to support years - long journeys the @entity175 is located at approximately 8000 ft elevation in an abandoned quarry on the northern slope of @entity17 in @entity5			1
the site contains little vegetation , no rare , threatened or endangered species , and no archaeological sites or cultural practices early in a mission , astronauts of ten develop round ‘ @entity186 ; faces because of the fluid , and they feel like they have a cold , ms @entity120 said			1
ms @entity157 ’s research is testing whether this affects the amount astronauts can taste			0
in a separate project , volunteers will spend several weeks in a bed with their heads lower than their feet			0
the @entity41 team will measure how fluid buildup in the head affects their sense of smell and how long that effect lasts			0
‘ we ’ll get a better understanding of how much of sensory loss of flavour is due to the fluid shift and how much might be due to other pieces , ’ said ms @entity120			2
results for the latest @entity23 project will take several months to process all the data gathered			0
@entity212 hopes to present findings at the @entity214 later this year in @entity215			0
the team performed other research tasks , including microbial analysis of food in the lab			2

a team of ‘ gastronauts ’ have spent the past four months in a dome trying to find out what foods astronauts might eat on a mission to @entity9
food needed to have a five - year shelf life and variety to be interesting
comfort food such as @entity234 , and *non-perishable* stock such as @entity82 , were popular choices
