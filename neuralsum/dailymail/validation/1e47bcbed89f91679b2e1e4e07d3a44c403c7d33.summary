@entity0 and @entity1 met on sunday and renewed hostilities in @entity5 football 's greatest rivalry , but 100 years ago they were making headlines for all the wrong reasons in a scandal that shocked the nation			1
the events ultimately cost one player his life and left another broken			1
it was good friday , april 4 1915 and @entity14 was at war			2
as the two sides met , @entity1 were struggling to avoid relegation , while @entity0 were in mid-table			1
in an oddly tame affair , @entity19 put @entity1 1 - 0 up before @entity0 defender @entity21 conceded a penalty yet @entity1 's @entity23 missed by some distance			1
@entity19 added a second before @entity0 forward @entity26 hit the crossbar and was seemingly chastised by teammates for trying to score			1
@entity29 ( second row , third from right ) sits next to @entity32 and @entity33 sits on the left of the front row ( all three are circled ) the sparse 18,000 @entity40 crowd , sensing something was awry , jeered and booed , the match referee and local reporters noted @entity0 's lack of commitment			1
united manager @entity44 is alleged to have left the stadium in disgust			2
' the second half was crammed with lifeless football , ' reported the @entity49			2
' @entity1 were two up with 22 minutes to play and they seemed so content with their lead that they apparently never tried to increase it			1
@entity0 scarcely ever gave the impression that they would be likely to score			1
' a fortnight later , handbills were circulated alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2 – 0 win to @entity1			1
a suspiciously large number of bets had been made on that very scoreline causing odds to shorten to 4/1			2
the two points @entity1 won from the game were enough to earn them 18th place and safety			1
united with the three trophies they won in 1909			2
@entity29 is seated front right the @entity68 published a notice from a bookmaker called ' @entity71 ' who promised a substantial reward for information that would lead to punishment of the ' instigators of this reprehensible conspiracy '			2
it stated : ' we have solid grounds for believing that a certain @entity81 match played in @entity82 during @entity83 weekend was ' squared , ' the home club being permitted to win by a certain score			2
' @entity86 , curator of the @entity1 museum , has been reflecting on the scandal this week as the 100th anniversary approaches with many questions still unanswered			1
' @entity91 was under intense scrutiny anyway , with it being wartime , ' he said			2
' there had been so many complaints in the newspapers , in parliament , from the military , that professional football was being played while @entity14 soldiers , sailors and airmen were being killed , so the powers - that - be were anxious to see that football was n't tarnished any further and they launched an investigation			2
' the @entity108 's lengthy delving found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match : @entity29 , @entity33 and @entity32 of @entity1 , and @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity21 and @entity114 of @entity0			1
@entity1 captain @entity115 holding the @entity116 on the steps of @entity118 they were accused of plotting the events during clandestine meetings at the @entity123 and @entity124 pub in @entity125			1
@entity112 , a former @entity1 player , was found to be the plot 's ringleader			1
@entity0 's @entity26 and @entity1 's @entity19 had refused to take part ; @entity26 had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result hence his teammates remonstrating with him when he hit the crossbar			1
he later testified against them and claimed @entity134 had offered him £ 3 in a taxi en route to the game			0
at the same hearing , @entity1 legend @entity138 denied any knowledge of the match - fixing , but said that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him			1
@entity1 2 @entity0 0 ( april 2 , 1915 ) @entity19 ( 2 ) @entity82 united : @entity144 ; @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity23 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity19 , @entity151 , @entity152			1
manager : @entity154 @entity0 : @entity155 ; @entity156 , @entity21 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity134 , @entity160 , @entity26 , @entity113 , @entity161			1
on december 23 , 1915 , the seven were banned from playing for life			2
@entity167 's @entity166 , a first class @entity169 cricketer , and @entity172 's @entity171 were also suspended for their part in placing bets			0
a distraught @entity175 , the only @entity1 player to have appeared in the game , protested his innocence and sued the @entity116 for libel			1
' it was n't a glorious episode , ' says @entity86			0
' players could see that football was changing			0
with the sport under such scrutiny amid wartime , it was pretty obvious that football in 1915/16 would be very different , if it happened at all			0
summer wages were being abolished , so once you got to the end of april there would be no wages until the end of august , and it was still unclear what would happen the following season			0
they could see their livelihood going			0
that was supposed to be encouragement for players to do things for the war effort			0
' by the time their bans were handed down , the @entity108 had suspended operations for the duration of the @entity208			0
it was suggested that if the men joined the armed forces their punishment would be rescinded			0
all except @entity151 , signed up			0
for @entity29 it was to have tragic consequences			0
the death certificate of @entity29 ( right ) , featuring the memorial at @entity217 in @entity218 a forward of great repute , @entity29 was a @entity221 character who had joined @entity1 from @entity172 with @entity149			1
the fiesty @entity222 , pioneered the first footballers union and his 1909 fa cup final winning goal prompted @entity1 's owners to build @entity40 to herald a new dawn			1
fittingly , @entity29 , who lived in @entity227 , scored @entity1 's first goal at the @entity40			1
yet following the betting scandal and facing a life without football , @entity29 went to war			1
sadly , on may 3 1917 , at the age of 33 , @entity233 @entity29 was killed during a muddled , unsuccessful night attack on @entity237 lines just east of @entity217 , @entity218			0
his body was never found			0
he left a widow , @entity240 , and four young children			2
the @entity116 gave him a posthumous reinstatement			0
all the other players , except @entity151 , had their bans lifted by the @entity116 in 1919 in recognition of their service to the country			0
@entity32 , who had been good friends with @entity29 , had continued to fight a different battle , one to clear his name			0
in february 1916 , when @entity1 and @entity0 played in a regional match , he took to standing outside @entity40 handing out handbills : ' £ 50 reward			1
to all whom it may concern : i , @entity256 ( late @entity1 ) , offer the above sum to be given to any @entity259 if any person or persons can prove that i bet or won any money in any way over the match at @entity40 , @entity1 v. @entity0 , on @entity265 , 1915 , the said match over which i got suspended			1
( @entity267 ) @entity256 , 68 railway road , @entity40			0
@entity32 twice unsuccessfully attempted to sue the @entity116 for libel and in 1918 was caught and banned again for playing under an assumed name for a club in @entity271			0
he was eventually pardoned under a general amnesty in 1945 , by which time he was aged 59			0
he had served the longest ban in football and maintained his innocence until his death in 1965			0
his family carried on his fight			0
a book entitled ' free the @entity1 one ' by @entity280 pleaded @entity32 's case			1
on publishing , @entity280 said : ' i am confident that at the very least , i have established that there is little or no genuine evidence which can be interpreted as conclusive proof of the guilt of @entity32 as he was charged			0
' @entity151 's great grandson , @entity288 , said : ' i would just like to set the record straight , @entity175 was wrongly accused of match fixing and he protested his innocence till his death bed			0
having been accused of this , it broke his heart , all he lived for was football			0
he died a broken man thanks to these accusations that were never proved			2
' sadly , the full truth may now never be known			0
the @entity299 reported : ' a more one - sided first half would be hard to witness			0
' the @entity68 wrote ' the @entity0 forwards gave the weakest exhibition in this half [ the second ] seen on the ground during the season			1
' the @entity49 reported , maybe most tellingly : ' the second half was crammed with lifeless football			0
@entity1 were two up with 22 minutes to play and they seemed so content with their lead that they apparently never tried to increase it			2
@entity0 scarcely ever gave the impression that they would be likely to score			2

@entity1 were *visitors* at @entity313 as they took on rivals @entity0
but 100 years ago the headlines were *stolen* for reasons other than rivalry
both sides were involved in a betting scandal that shocked the nation
the sorry events ultimately cost one player his life and left another broken
