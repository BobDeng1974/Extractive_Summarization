serenade : @entity0 looked delighted when she was serenaded by a group of tenors during the event looking good : @entity0 had worn a glamorous sparkly top for a lunchtime reception in @entity4 a day earlier but for once , all eyes were on @entity0 , who , following months of speculation , has confirmed that she will give birth to twins in december			1
speculation has now turned to the succession , with pundits left contemplating the question of how the birth of multiple babies might affect the succession			1
according to @entity6 's constitution , the first - born baby is the closest in line to the throne , with priority given to males			2
in 2002 , when @entity29 was still single , his father @entity107 quietly changed @entity6 's constitutional laws to allow his daughters , @entity110 and @entity111 , and their children to inherit the throne should @entity29 fail to marry and produce an heir			1
@entity0 , who was born in @entity114 and raised in @entity115 , married the @entity6 royal in july 2011			1
in june , @entity29 told the @entity117 that he and his wife were ' overjoyed ' , ' thrilled ' and ' very excited ' about the impending arrival of their child - or children , as they are now known to be			1
for charity : the high - profile event awards fellowships and grants to promising up - and - comers in the entertainment industry , including dancers and actors			2

@entity29 , 56 , has two other children - daughter @entity147 , born in 1992 to @entity149 @entity148 , and @entity150 , born in 2003 to @entity151 air hostess , @entity29			1
under @entity6 's inheritance laws , neither of @entity29 's two illegitimate children have no claim to royal titles and are not considered his official heirs			1
his daughter @entity158 was born in @entity159 to a former waitress with whom @entity29 had a brief fling			2
now 22 , she recently graduated from @entity162 in @entity163			0
his son @entity164 , now ten , lives with his mother , a former @entity166 hostess from @entity151 , on the @entity167			0
@entity29 reportedly demanded dna tests for both children before accepting paternity			2
with an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies , an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - is n't unusual			2
@entity178 , @entity179 is one royal parent of twins , who with wife princess @entity181 welcomed @entity182 and @entity183 in 2013			0
another is crown prince frederik of denmark and his wife @entity186 , who became parents to prince @entity189 and princess @entity190 in 2011			0
prince @entity191 , @entity192 is yet another royal father of twins , following the birth of @entity195 , @entity196 and prince @entity197 , @entity199 , to his wife @entity200 in 2010			0
but although royal twins are fairly frequent among @entity203 dynasties , among them the @entity6 couple , @entity205 royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years			2
born to @entity211 of @entity212 and his wife @entity213 in 1430 , @entity209 and @entity210 were the first and only twins born to @entity205 royal parents			0
tragically though , @entity209 , the eldest of the two , died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of @entity212 as @entity219 during his marriage to @entity186 , @entity210 sired no fewer than seven children , all of them in separate pregnancies			0
despite the lack of @entity205 royal twins , odds have shortened on another set of royal twins - belonging to the @entity192 and @entity228 - being announced			0
while the @entity6 rules of succession are clear , the @entity205 rules are n't set in stone , although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares , the question of who inherits what is less vexed			1
in theory , with @entity240 already in the royal nursery , the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role			0
as for which parent is responsible for the @entity6 royal twins - or the @entity205 ones , should they come to pass , consultant gynaecologist dr @entity247 says both could be behind a multiple birth , although the mother is the more likely candidate			1
‘ twins are not genetically based , ' he explains			0
' @entity256 twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two , creating identical twins			0
‘ another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised , creating non identical twins			0
‘ if either the mother or the father have twins in their family , the chances of them having twins is higher			0
’ a crown fit for two ? princess @entity0 and @entity29 announced on tuesday that they expecting twins - which has led many to speculate which baby will inherit the throne wedding bells : @entity0 , 36 , a former @entity67 swimmer from @entity115 , married @entity29 in july 2011 ' the truth is that , i 'm sorry to say , @entity29 has n’t seen @entity164 since a brief visit last september , ' she claimed			1
' it has become impossible since he married that girl			0
' in 2005 , @entity29 said in an interview with @entity284 that while @entity164 will never inherit the throne , ' he will be very well taken care of ' - presumably financially			2
while it 's rare for a noble figure to have twin heirs , it has happened before - most recently in 2009 , when @entity291 , the seventh @entity292 , welcomed twin boys with his wife @entity294 , a former fashion model 23 years his junior			0
born by c - section three months premature , the boys were named @entity298 and @entity300 @entity299			0
older by a few minutes , @entity209 is the heir - apparent to the @entity301 and bears the courtesy title @entity292			0
@entity300 is known as @entity292			0
succession : in 2002 , @entity107 changed @entity6 's constitutional laws to allow his daughters @entity110 ( left ) and @entity111 ( right ) and their children to inherit the throne should @entity29 fail to marry and produce an heir who will it belong to ? the @entity311 in @entity6 pictured during the wedding ceremony of @entity29 illegitimate : @entity29 has two children out of wedlock - one of whom is daughter @entity147			1
