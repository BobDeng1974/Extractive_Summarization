court claim : @entity1 says @entity2 collaborated in his torture silencing a @entity5 dissident who claimed @entity2 helped deliver him to @entity7 ’s torturers has cost taxpayers almost £ 400,000			1
@entity1 , an @entity9 militant fighter , says he was subjected to ‘ extraordinary rendition ’ to @entity5 on the basis of @entity13 intelligence and tortured with the help of @entity2 spies			1
he would settle for a token payment of £ 1 along with an admission and apology , but @entity20 lawyers have spent £ 372,632 trying to stop the case coming to court			1
they argue that a full hearing could damage relations with the @entity25			1
campaigners reject this , saying the government simply wants to conceal its involvement in the case			1
ministers lost the argument at the @entity33 , which ruled in october that a @entity2 judge could consider the case even if it covered alleged wrongdoing by government agents			1
they are appealing against that judgement , meaning the legal bill will rise even further next year when the case comes before the @entity41			2
if the case does eventually come before a judge , ministers face having to reveal in full the extent of @entity2 ’s involvement with mr @entity1 and his wife @entity46 , who is also claiming compensation			1
legal campaigners said it was indefensible for the government to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds to stop the public hearing the facts of the case			2
@entity54 , of @entity55 , which is representing mr @entity1 , said : ‘ surely a case involving such serious issues as rendition and torture deserves its day in court			2
‘ mr @entity1 and @entity61 have even offered to drop their case in return for an admission , an apology , and a token payment of £ 1 from each defendant			1
‘ yet instead , the government is spending staggering amounts of public money trying to ensure it is never heard at all			0
sadly , this is all part of a bigger picture of obfuscation by the government , which only emphasises the importance of holding a proper , independent inquiry into @entity2 involvement in torture			2
’ a letter found in the bombed - out ruins of @entity7 ’s spy headquarters apparently shows sir @entity83 – then head of @entity13 ’s counter-terrorism division – taking credit for handing mr @entity1 and @entity61 over to the regime			1
among mr @entity1 ’s claims is that sir @entity83 is guilty of complicity in torture , conspiracy to injury , misfeasance in public office and negligence			1
the 48 - year - old is also suing former foreign secretary @entity97			0
the @entity98 – the government ’s legal office – has revealed it has paid out more than £ 30,000 on mr @entity97 ’s defence in the case and more than £ 113,000 on sir @entity83 ’s			1
deal in the @entity103 : @entity104 shakes colonel @entity7 's hand at their now notorious meeting of 2004 mr @entity1 , a former @entity109 mujahedeen who became a leading figure in the @entity5 resistance which overthrew the @entity7 regime , had been attempting to claim asylum in @entity2			1
he was captured in @entity115 in march 2004 and passed into the custody of the @entity117 who sent him to @entity119			0
the @entity117 plane refuelled in the @entity122 territory of @entity123 – raising serious questions about the repeated denials from @entity127 ministers that the @entity2 had ever been involved in extraordinary rendition			2
while he was held in @entity5 , mr @entity1 says he was questioned by @entity2 intelligence officers who he says knew he was being tortured but did nothing to help him			1
sir @entity83 ( right ) , who is accused of handing @entity1 over to the @entity5 , was also the spy who brought @entity7 in from the cold			1
the former head of @entity13 counter-terrorism was the agency ’s chief arabist at the time of @entity127 ’s love - in with the tyrant , and helped pave the way for @entity104 to visit the dictator in @entity119 in 2004			0
it was sir @entity83 who forged close ties with @entity7 ’s playboy son @entity143 and @entity5 ’s ruthless intelligence chief @entity144			1
the 61 - year - old father of two was on the advisory board of @entity147 , a foreign policy thinktank within the @entity149 , which tarnished its name by awarding @entity143 a phd			0
following this the @entity152 offered a £ 1.5million donation to the @entity149 , of which £ 300,000 was received			0
after studying @entity155 at @entity156 , sir @entity83 joined the @entity157 at 23 , and developed unparalleled contacts in the @entity160 world			2
he allegedly entertained @entity144 – also known as @entity5 ’s former torturer - in - chief – at the @entity163 on @entity164 in 2003 , the year sanctions against @entity5 were lifted			2
the pair allegedly worked together closely , with sir @entity83 helping @entity144 obtain telephone numbers and details of @entity5 dissidents in the @entity2			1
in one fawning letter found last year , sir @entity83 congratulated his counterpart on helping mastermind a pr coup with the ‘ deal in the desert ’ between @entity104 and @entity7 which helped secure drilling rights in @entity5 for @entity176 and @entity177			1
shortly afterwards , sir @entity83 quit the intelligence service and joined @entity176 as a £ 200,000 - a - year adviser			1
details of his case emerged in secret documents found in the ruins of @entity7 ’s spy agency ’s headquarters in september 2011			2
as the regime crumbled in the face of an onslaught from @entity191 - backed rebel fighters , investigators recovered a message apparently sent by sir @entity83 to @entity144 , the feared head of @entity5 intelligence and @entity7 ’s torturer - in - chief			1
crucially the documents appeared to show how he was ‘ rendered ’ just as @entity104 was cosying up to the @entity187 as part of the infamous ‘ deal in the desert ’			0
in the files was a letter apparently from sir @entity83 , dated march 2004 , to @entity144 , in which he tries to take credit for helping to apprehend mr @entity1 , saying it was ‘ the least we could do for you ’			1
referring to mr @entity1 by his alias , he wrote : ‘ amusingly , we got a request from the @entity25 to channel requests for information from @entity208 through the @entity25			1
i have no intention of doing any such thing			0
the intelligence about @entity208 was @entity2			0
’ the fax also discussed arrangements for mr @entity104 ’s visit to @entity119 just weeks later where he would meet the tyrant , and complete a deal on oil and ending his development of weapons of mass destruction			0
mr @entity1 ’s case is also the subject of a criminal investigation by @entity224			2
both he and his wife say they underwent mistreatment at the hands of the @entity25 while they were held in @entity229 and before they were handed over to @entity7			2
he says he was blindfolded , hooded and forced to wear ear defenders before he was hung from a hook in the cell			0
he was then beaten and the ear defenders removed so loud music could be played into his ears , as he was interrogated by his captors			0
miss @entity46 , who was four - and - a - half months pregnant , was allegedly denied food and chained to a wall for five days			0
in june the @entity20 said @entity157 files detailing @entity117 rendition flights on @entity123 may have been accidentally destroyed by water damage			0
but in september it changed its position again , and said only ‘ a small number of immigration cards … have been damaged to the point of no longer being useful ’			0
in 2008 , @entity246 , the then @entity127 foreign secretary , had to admit that @entity123 had been used twice in 2002 for refuelling of rendition flights in the months after the 9/11 terror attacks			0
ministers have consistently denied prisoners ever left the plane or set foot there			0
but since then there appear to have been more flights			0
mr @entity97 has denied being aware of the rendition and allowing it to happen			0
sir @entity83 has never commented publicly on the case			2
a @entity157 spokesman said : ‘ civil litigation proceedings are under way , so we are unable to comment on the details of this case			0
‘ the government has been clear that it stands firmly against torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment			0
we do not condone it , nor do we ask others to do it on our behalf			0

@entity1 says he was tortured with the help of @entity2 spies
government lawyers spent £ 372k trying to quash his compensation claim
they say hearing could ruin relations with @entity25 - which campaigners reject
they are now appealing to @entity41 against @entity33 ruling
ministers face revealing full involvement with mr @entity1 and his wife
sir @entity83 , accused of handing mr @entity1 to @entity5 , also brought @entity7 in from the cold
