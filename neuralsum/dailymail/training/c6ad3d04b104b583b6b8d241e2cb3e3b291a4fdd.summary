leader of the @entity1 unveiled plans aimed at delivering ' home rule ' for @entity4 @entity8 nationalists will still be able to interfere in laws which do n't apply north of the border - despite moves to introduce @entity4 votes for @entity4 laws , @entity6 backbenchers said today			1
under proposals put forward by @entity15 , policies affecting @entity4 alone would be scrutinised by a panel made up only of mps representing @entity4 seats			1
a ' grand committee ' of all @entity4 mps would then have to approve the legislation			0
but the proposals still allow @entity8 mps to block @entity4 - only laws at a final @entity26 - wide vote			1
former cabinet minister @entity27 said mr @entity15 's plans needed to be ' strengthened '			0
he said : ' it invites the @entity30 to come in and interfere with @entity4 laws and that might prove to be counter-productive			1
we will have to wait and see			0
' mr @entity27 added : ' if you had a lot of @entity35 , for example , who wanted something for @entity8 then presumably they would all gang up and try to block an @entity4 proposal until we cave in			1
' far from keeping the @entity44 together , as the minority of mps think who want this proposal , it actually does more damage because it gives a battering ram against the @entity44 to @entity35			1
it is a very , very dangerous thing to do			0
' a large section of @entity6 backbenchers are angry at what they say is a watering down of @entity58 's promise to introduce english - votes - for - english - laws			0
barring @entity8 mps from voting on key affairs would permanently cripple @entity63 's influence at @entity64 , given the party 's reliance on the support of its 41 mps north of the border			1
at the last election , the @entity6 won 296 of 533 mps in @entity4 and would have had an overall majority of 59			2
the last @entity63 government passed several key pieces of legislation – including that introducing foundation hospitals and tuition fees – thanks to the votes of @entity8 mps whose constituents were unaffected , given @entity83 's control of health and education policy			2
senior conservatives insist @entity8 mps should be barred from determining laws that only affect @entity4 , given @entity8 's new rights to determine its own affairs			1
former cabinet minister @entity27 said mr @entity15 's plans needed to be ' strengthened ' to win support from @entity6 mps mr @entity15 today outlined proposals for an @entity4 veto , which would apply to income tax , air passenger duty and other matters affecting only @entity4			1
the conservatives want a new committee stage of legislation relating only to @entity4 , or only to @entity4 and @entity101 , would be considered only by mps from those parts of the @entity26			0
crucially , those mps would then have a veto over such legislation to prevent the wishes of the @entity4 or @entity4 and @entity101 being overridden by @entity8 mps			1
however , the legislation would still have to then clear a final hurdle of all mps , as it does now , meaning @entity8 mps could attempt to throw out an entire @entity111			2
yesterday , @entity112 paved the way for a more generous benefits system in @entity8 in a desperate bid to outflank the @entity30 on the left mr @entity15 said : ' the prime minister and i have decided that the option we will put forward to @entity121 and the country will be one that gives an effective veto to @entity4 @entity35 over matters only affecting @entity4 , or @entity4 and @entity101 , while maintaining the integrity of the @entity121			1
both of these objectives are crucial , and both can be fulfilled by our chosen way forward			0
' we conservatives believe that this principle of @entity4 consent , the @entity4 veto should be extended to taxation when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to @entity8 – and under a conservative government it will be			2
' this is a fundamental matter of fairness			2
how could it possibly be right for the @entity83 for example , to vote for a reduction in @entity142 in @entity8 and then for @entity8 mps to come to @entity64 and be able to impose an increase in @entity142 in @entity4 ? ' you only have to think about this for a moment to see how fundamentally important this is and how such issues have to be addressed			1
under our proposal this would not be possible without the agreement of @entity4 mps			0
' mr @entity15 rejected the argument that reform will weaken the @entity26 , insisting : ' i say that failure to act would be the true weakening of the @entity26			0
' yesterday , @entity112 paved the way for a more generous benefits system in @entity8 in a desperate bid to outflank the @entity30 on the left			0
with panic sweeping through @entity63 amid fears of a general election wipe - out at the hands of @entity168 , the former prime minister yesterday unveiled plans to hand yet more powers to @entity83			0
in his first foray into the election campaign , mr @entity112 said @entity63 wanted the @entity83 to be able to make top - up payments to all benefit claimants if it wins the general election , raising the possibility of a higher state pension and more generous dole payments north of the border			0
an academic report by professor @entity181 of the @entity182 for the @entity183 at @entity184 yesterday predicted that @entity58 will remain in power because @entity63 will lose so many seats to the @entity30			0
the @entity188 threat is ' categorical ' , according to the findings , and could see the party win 45 of @entity8 's 59 seats , leaving @entity63 with a rump of just ten @entity8 mps .			2

@entity15 unveils proposals to limit the influence of @entity8 mps
but the plan stops short of *banning* @entity8 mps voting on @entity4 laws
@entity6 mps fear fear the proposal gives @entity30 a ' battering ram ' in @entity121
but @entity4 @entity35 will still get a ' veto ' over @entity4 laws under new rules
leader of the @entity1 said reform is ' fundamental matter of fairness '
