the internet is facing its biggest ever threat , thanks in part of @entity2 and @entity3 , the co-founder of @entity5 has claimed			1
@entity8 said government attempts to control web access and the rise of the increasingly ' restrictive ' @entity2 and @entity3 platforms threaten freedom of information online			1
mr @entity8 also said attempts by the entertainment industry to crack down on piracy have led to the @entity18 using the same technology and approach it has criticised @entity21 and @entity22 for using			1
@entity5 co-founder @entity8 , pictured left with co-founder @entity23 , said governments , @entity3 and @entity2 are all threatening internet freedom mr @entity8 told @entity26 : ' there are very powerful forces that have lined up against the open internet on all sides and around the world			1
' i am more worried than i have been in the past			0
' mr @entity8 said the rise of ' walled garden ' like @entity2 and @entity3 , which tightly control what software can be released on their platforms , were restricting innovation online			1
both platforms have risen to become consumer giants with their own proprietary platforms which control access to their users and data			0
the 38 - year - old told @entity26 that he and @entity5 co-founder @entity23 could not have created their search engine if the internet was dominated by @entity2			1
with data stored on @entity2 apps not searchable and only accessible to closed , restricted networks of users , the increasingly closed nature of the web risked stifline innovation , he said			1
' there 's a lot to be lost , ' he said			0
' for example all the information in apps â€” that data is not " crawlable " by web crawlers			0
you ca n't search it			0
' mr @entity8 's criticism of @entity3 and @entity2 was part of an alarming portrait he painted of the current internet landscape			1
he also said the original open ethos championed by internet pioneers was under threat from plans by governments to monitor web use and attempts by entertainment companies to push through new laws allowing them to demand the closure of pirate websites			0
restrictive : @entity2 and @entity3 both tightly control software on their platforms and access to their users @entity21 has recently introduced ' real identity ' rules in a bid to rein in microbloggers who have become increasingly critical of the regime , while @entity91 bloggers who helped foment protests against @entity93 are facing increased pressure from the @entity95			2
@entity22 is reportedly planning to introduce a sealed ' national internet ' from this summer , while the @entity98 government has announced plans to monitor citizens ' use of email and social networks			0
mr @entity8 said five years ago he did not believe @entity21 or any country could effectively restrict the internet for long but he had been proven wrong			2
' i thought there was no way to put the genie back in the bottle , but now it seems in certain areas the genie has been put back in the bottle , ' mr @entity8 said			2
he cited @entity21 , @entity115 and @entity22 as the greatest threats			0
in the @entity18 , the entertainment industry , he said , is failing to understand that users will continue to download pirated content as long as it is easier to acquire and use than legitimately obtained material			2
' i have n't tried it for many years but when you go on a pirate website , you choose what you like , it downloads to the device of your choice and it will just work - and then when you have to jump through all these hoops ( to buy legitimate content ) , the walls created are disincentives for people to buy			0
' some will take mr @entity8 's comments on @entity5 rival @entity2 , which has seen huge growth and now has more than 800 million members globally , with a grain of salt			1
the social network has announced plans for a $ 100 billion ipo			0
but his comments on increased interference by governments were echoed by @entity145 , co-founder of @entity146 , the 14 - million strong activist network which has help train and equip activists in @entity149			0
mr @entity145 said : ' governments are realising the power of this medium to organise people and they are trying to clamp down across the world , not just in places like @entity21 and @entity156 ; we 're seeing bills in the @entity18 , in @entity159 , all across the world			2
' mr @entity8 also conceded that @entity5 has itself lost the trust of many because its servers sit on @entity18 soil , and users ' data are in reach of @entity18 authorities			1
he admitted the company was forced to hand over information to the @entity18 government , and was also sometimes stopped from even telling users it had done so .			2

' walled gardens ' restricting *possibilities* for innovation online , says @entity8
governments worldwide - from @entity22 to the @entity18 - also *imposing* restrictions on free *speech* online
@entity5 could not have been created if the web was dominated by @entity2 , mr @entity8 says
he concedes that @entity18 authorities ability to force @entity5 to *divulge* users ' data has *eroded* trust
