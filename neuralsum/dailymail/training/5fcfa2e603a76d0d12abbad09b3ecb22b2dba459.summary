@entity1 manager @entity0 is confident his side can overcome the absence of midfield driving force @entity4			1
@entity1 will be without the influential @entity4 for up to another four weeks due to his involvement in the @entity7 with @entity8			1
@entity4 was sorely missed during the tournaments of 2012 and 2013 , and although he has not been at his formidable best this season , his recent form has been good			1
@entity0 ( right ) believes @entity1 can cope without midfielder @entity4 ( left ) @entity0 ( left ) watches on during his side 's training session ahead of their game against @entity16 on sunday @entity17 , who has played as a forward in recent weeks for @entity1 , pictured during a training session @entity20 controls the ball during @entity1 's training session on friday , two days before they play @entity16 following last week 's draw with @entity24 - the first match of @entity4 's absence - city have actually not won in the @entity27 without the former @entity29 player since last april			1
@entity4 was rested when @entity1 were surprisingly held by @entity30 on december 28 and also when they drew at @entity16 in september			1
@entity0 said : ' of course we are going to miss @entity4 because he is a very important player - in the same way that we miss @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity20 , or all the players that for different reasons can not play every week			1
' but we have a squad and we have to replace @entity4			2
we must continue fighting for the title with or without @entity4			2
we have to play two more games without @entity4 and he will arrive here in february			2
i do n't think our team depends just on one player			0
' in terms of league action , @entity4 will definitely miss sunday 's return clash against @entity16 at the @entity49 and the january 31 trip to title rivals @entity51			1
@entity1 have coped without the 31 - year - old before , most recently in the @entity53 when he missed the vital wins over @entity55 and @entity56 in november and december through suspension			2
@entity4 himself is confident @entity1 can come through the spell			1
@entity60 ( left ) keeps out a shot that fellow goalkeeper @entity62 ( right ) was unable to get a hand to @entity64 will look to fill the void left by @entity4 's departure for the @entity7 @entity34 is returning to fitness for @entity1 after missing most of december and the @entity69 period with a knee injury @entity71 will look to continue his fine form for the @entity27 champions when they take on @entity16 speaking in an interview while on international duty , @entity4 told @entity77 : ' i think @entity1 can compete without me to be honest with you			1
' we get fantastic players and i think you 've been able to see when we miss @entity34 with injury , we 've been able to cope without him			0
' when you see we miss @entity85 we 've been able to cope without him , but at the moment i think we 're in good shape			0
' in the same interview , however , @entity4 did give further mixed messages about his future			2
@entity4 sparked considerable speculation over his status at @entity1 during an unsettled last summer when he voiced criticisms of the club amid the notorious birthday cake saga			1
he again cast doubt over his position when asked if he would still be at @entity49 next season			0
' i do n't know			0
i 'm at @entity1 at the moment , ' he said , before laughing			2
it is not the first time @entity4 has been vague on the subject but @entity0 has no concerns about it			1
the @entity105 said : ' i think @entity4 is 100 per cent committed with our team and with this team			2
i do n't have any doubts about that			0
' when pressed further @entity0 , speaking at a press conference to preview the @entity16 game , acknowledged circumstances can change but presently has no doubts and insists there is no link to last year 's issues			1
he said : ' i do n't think any of us know what will happen in six months more			0
we do n't know where you can be , we can not know what will happen in the future			0
goalkeeper @entity60 appeared in jubilant spirits ahead during the @entity1 session defender @entity126 ( centre ) shares a joke with his team - mates ahead of the training session @entity131 ( second right ) warms up as he gets ready for the game against the team he left to join @entity1 in the summer ' but it 's not a problem with his commitment			2
you ca n't link one thing with the other			0
i repeat , @entity4 is very happy here			0
his commitment with our club is not a problem			0
' @entity4 has played a key role in @entity1 's development over recent years and @entity0 is determined to maintain progress , with success in the @entity53 an obvious target			1
@entity0 recently suggested his playmaker @entity20 lacks the recognition he deserves because he is not at one of @entity157 's bigger clubs			0
however , he believes winning @entity157 's greatest prize with @entity1 is a realistic ambition and accolades for individuals could then follow			1
asked if @entity1 could one day win the @entity53 , @entity0 said : ' i think so , the way we are growing , and we will continue improving with this squad and bringing in new players			1
of course , i think we have chances to continue winning important things			0
' maybe we do not have the whole history of @entity170 , @entity29 or @entity171 but that is part of the reason this club tries to improve every year			0
' we need to win important trophies and that way our top players will be on the list of the best players of the year			0
' our club must improve and grow every year , winning important titles			0
