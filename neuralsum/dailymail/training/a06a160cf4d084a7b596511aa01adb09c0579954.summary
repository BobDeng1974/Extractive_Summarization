tragedy : @entity1 suffered a fatal bite from a brown recluse last sunday at home in @entity5 , @entity6 three photographs taken by five - year - old @entity1 's mother chart the progress of the fatal spider bite that tragically ended his life the sunday before @entity13			1
the first picture which reveals a noticeable swelling and redness on @entity1 's shoulder blade was taken by @entity18 just 15 minutes after he was bitten by the brown recluse			1
the second photograph was taken just one hour later and reveals the bite has turned into a tender looking welt on the back of the @entity23 , @entity6 , boy			2
the third photograph was taken in hospital by @entity1 's mother nine hours after he was bitten and shows a rash and painful blotching of the skin			1
@entity1 passed away suddenly from a cardiac arrest five hours later			1
@entity18 has made the difficult decision to release the images of her dead son in a bid to raise awareness among parents of the dangers of a brown recluse spider bite			1
she wants them to know that the minute they suspect their child has been bitten to rush them to medical attention			1
the distraught mother also wants her son 's final wish to be granted - to give all his @entity49 gifts away to children in @entity51			1
it was last sunday that @entity1 was bitten at around 9am , wearing his new pajamas			1
his mother then took him to the doctors office where he started showing symptons			1
he told @entity18 he had been and showed her the red mark on his shoulder blade			1
' he said something had stung him , ' said @entity18 to @entity60			2
' it was a brand new pajama top and this spider was in his shirt			1
i saw a welt on his back			2
' first two bites : @entity1 was bitten at around 9am last sunday and showed his mother - who took a picture 15 minutes afterwards ( left ) and again one hour after that ( right ) deterioration : the spider bite is pictured here nine hours after @entity1 told his mother and tragically , five hours before he passed away having been bitten herself by a brown recluse , @entity18 knew that bites could turn serious , and decided to take @entity1 straight away to @entity75 in @entity76 and got there within one hour			1
while there @entity1 began running a fever of 100 and doctors were concerned the spider 's venom was ' going systemic ' - which is a rare reaction to the brown recluse bite			1
' they took it very seriously [ at @entity86			2
they started him on antibiotics , steroids and @entity90 , ' said @entity18 to the examiner			0
' his vitals were all normal			0
he was laughing and playing and being a 5 - year - old boy			0
the doctor said he was going to send him to @entity95 's of @entity96 or @entity97 , whichever one was quicker , but he did n't seem to think it was going to get worse			2
' it was just in case anything happened , he would have the best care			0
' first off he was taken to by ambulance to @entity105			0
memory : @entity18 watched helplessly as her son 's condition went downhill during the day after he was bitten by the brown recluse spider culprit : this is the brown recluse spider that bit @entity1 and was killed and captured by his mother for the benefit of the doctors also known as the fiddleback spider , the violin spider or the brown fiddler , the brown recluse spider has venomous and potentially fatal bite			1
they are usually brown or gray in colour and between six to 20 millimeters in length			2
they typically have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax , these markings include a black line coming from the dorsel side that looks like a violin , resulting in the nickname ' fiddleback '			0
the spiders often build their webs in dry , generally undisturbed locations , including sheds , closets , garages , cellars and other similar places			0
in @entity144 , their range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern @entity146 through to southern @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , to southwestern @entity150			0
in the southern states , they are native from central @entity153 to western @entity154 and north to @entity155			0
@entity157 recluse spiders have the ability to survive starvation and thirst , and the way in which they benefit from the regulated room temperatures of human habitations , make extermination of this species particularly challenging			2
@entity18 said the bite appeared to get worse there and became black and blue like he had been struck by a baseball			2
his condition became too serious for those at @entity105 to handle so @entity1 was immediately transferred to another hospital - children 's of @entity96			1
however , once there , @entity1 began to deteriorate			1
he developed head and stomach pains and the doctors decided to place him on oxygen and take him to the intensive care unit			0
' he was talking in the elevator on the way to @entity183 , arguing with the doctor			0
the doctor wanted him to open his mouth and he said , ' no , i do n't want to			0
' just being a 5 - year - old			0
suddenly as @entity18 was waiting outside the @entity183 at around 11.30pm she heard raised voices and the unmistakable sound of panic			0
' doors started flying open and people started coming running from everywhere			0
i 've never seen so many doctors in one room , ' said @entity18 to the examiner			0
' the nurse came out in the hallway and sat down			0
they told me his heart had stopped			0
' wish : @entity1 wanted to give all his @entity49 presents to children in @entity51 who have none and his mother wants anyone who can help to drop them off at @entity208 in @entity209 , @entity6 the doctors told her that their son 's blood was failing to clot and that his organs were bleeding internally			1
' i was in the room when they shocked him for the 17th time , and i knew there was nothing else in this world that they could do for him			0
i told them it was time to stop , ' said @entity18			0
stunned , @entity18 buried her son on friday , the day after @entity13			2
trying to turn the tragedy into a triumph , @entity18 has decided to fulfull her son 's wish to give toys to children in @entity51 who have none			1
' he wanted all the kids in @entity51 to have toys , ' said @entity18 to @entity234			1
' i mean , he was going to give his own toys			2
