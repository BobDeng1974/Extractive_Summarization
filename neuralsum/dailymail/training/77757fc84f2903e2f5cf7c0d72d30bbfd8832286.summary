@entity6 , the @entity18 and the @entity19 led around 2,000 worshippers at the service in @entity15 where early editions of the @entity13 were presented at the altar			1
dr @entity16 told the congregation that the translators would have been ' baffled and embarrassed ' by the idea of a perfect translation but had sought instead to convey the ' almost unbearable weight of divine intelligence and love ' into the @entity40 language			0
delight : the queen with her bouquet ' the temptation is always there for the modern translator to look for strategies that make the text more accessible - and when that temptation comes , it does n't hurt to turn for a moment - for some long moments indeed - to this extraordinary text , ' he said			0
