' distraught : the jury was played a 13 - minute 999 call by the 31 - year - olds ' parents @entity71 and @entity72 ( pictured ) @entity8 , who denies murder and told police his brother had threatened him , listened in the dock as the case was opened against him yesterday			1
prosecutor @entity78 said the brothers had spent a ' happy and relaxed ' evening drinking at their parents ’ terraced house from 6pm on december 31 last year			1
but things soured at about 8pm when they started talking about ' the past ' , mr @entity83 said - leading to the emotional 999 call at 9pm by their mother @entity72 and father @entity71			1
abandoned party food such as cheese , apple and crackers and cans of @entity94 lay littered around the room where @entity7 was stabbed			1
the couple have watched previous hearings from the public gallery , but were absent yesterday as their remaining son went on trial			0
mr @entity83 told the jury of nine men and three women : ' this is a tragic case			2
in a nutshell , it was @entity4 last year and both brothers had been drinking			2
' shortly before 9pm an argument started between the two brothers and that argument appears to have turned into a tussle			0
punches may have been exchanged			0
' at some point , this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother			1
' the defendant inflicted just one wound , but the tract of that wound was quite long , about 15 - 17 centimetres or approximately six or seven inches , and it punctured the aorta , the principle artery which runs down a person ’s trunk			2
' that injury caused major internal bleeding and @entity7 ’s subsequent collapse			2
' a post mortem revealed a six to seven inch stab wound on @entity7 ’s abdomen which cut through his aorta			1
tests showed he had 230 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood , around three times the drink drive limit			2
traces of cannabis and antidepressants were also found			0
his face was bruised from a punch and where he fell to the ground			0
@entity8 told police he had drunk six cans of lager and two glasses of red wine before leaving the house			1
murder scene : the alleged argument broke out at the twins ' parents ' house in @entity13 , @entity14 ( pictured ) in interviews , @entity8 said his brother had been threatening him with the knife and he had either taken it , or picked up another , in a bid to defend himself			1
the kitchen knife said to have been used - its handle broken and the blade bent - was discovered in the kitchen sink			1
@entity162 found on the knife matched both the defendant and his brother because , as identical twins , they shared the same dna profile			2
in his first police interview on @entity169 , @entity8 described his relationship with @entity7 as ' fiery ' and said drink could make him ' nasty ' and ' short - tempered '			1
he added : ' we started arguing , i do not know about what ... all i can remember is he picked a knife up and walked towards me and i sort of panicked			2
' i do not remember much			0
i punched him - i had a knife in my hand			2
he yelped and i ran out of the door			0
' in a later interview he said he had not intended to kill his brother but had ' just reacted '			0
jurors heard text messages between @entity8 and his girlfriend , @entity184 , which showed how the mood deteriorated			1
defendant : @entity8 denies murder at @entity30 , @entity14 , where the trial continues an earlier message from @entity190 read : ' i can not wait to marry you ! ! ! xxx ' , followed at 6.30pm by : ' yes sexy			1

but at 7pm he wrote : ' me and @entity194 are going at it			0
we got things to sort out but all good			0
enjoy your night my lovely , i love you '			0

this is my life ! ! do n’t want this but what can i do			0
sorry but this is what i have got to put up with and i hate it			0
want to f * * * off anywhere but here '			0

the couple had previously dated for six years and her son and three daughters described him as a ‘ father figure ’			0
closing his opening statement , mr @entity83 said : ' this was a tragedy for @entity7 , for his parents and for his family			1
' no doubt the defendant bitterly regrets that moment of stupidity when he picked up that knife and chose to use it as he did , but it was not , we say , an act of self defence			0
' sad though it may be , the prosecution say that the defendant almost certainly acted in a fit of temper			0
' perhaps he did not intend to kill his brother but we say he almost certainly intended to really serious injury			0
' if a person uses a knife , intending to cause that person really serious injury and they then die , then that person is guilty of murder			1
' @entity8 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , denies murder			1
