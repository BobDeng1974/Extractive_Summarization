@entity0 believes there must be underlying reasons for @entity3 to leave @entity4 for south @entity5 as ' @entity6 will never be as big as ' the @entity7			1
@entity3 is close to completing a return to @entity6 , where he spent the best years of his playing career as a midfielder , after @entity4 accepted a £ 2million compensation package for their manager			1
but he is leaving a club safely in mid-table mediocrity - with his former charges sitting ninth in the table - for a side battling for @entity21 survival and struggling in the relegation zone			0
@entity3 will leave @entity4 to be appointed as the new @entity6 manager @entity3 applauds the home crowd after @entity4 's 3 - 2 win against @entity26 at @entity27 the curiosity of such a move leads @entity0 to believe @entity3 is simply fed up with the way he has been treated at @entity27 by owner @entity31 and the supporters			1
former @entity33 defender @entity0 said on @entity34 : ' i 'm less surprised than @entity36 ( @entity37 that @entity3 would move to @entity38 )			1
' @entity6 will never be as big as @entity4 , so why would he move ? ' the fans do n't particularly like him			2
does he get enough support from above ? they sold ( @entity43 ) @entity42 , could they lose ( @entity46 ) @entity45 , ( @entity48 ) @entity47 ? @entity4 owner @entity31 , who is currently in @entity50 , had the final say on @entity3 's future the @entity4 fans wanted @entity3 out after a difficult start to the 2014 - 15 @entity21 campaign ' he 's been there for a long time , how long can you stay ? they 're a much bigger club , of course they are , but how long can you stay ? ' his family still live down there ( in @entity5 ) and he may see this as a big opportunity to make a stamp on a club whereas he ca n't at @entity4 because of the constraints on him			1
' @entity6 sit 18th in the table and @entity3 will find himself thrust straight into a relegation scrap at @entity38			2
@entity4 supporters hold up a ' @entity3 is a muppet ' banner ahead of their team 's @entity21 clash against @entity74 in april @entity75 defender @entity37 thinks that @entity3 's decision is due to the ' survival game ' that is being a manager of a @entity21 club			1
speaking on @entity34 , he said : ' management is all about risk , they 're taking risks and gambling all the time			0
' i said i would be surprised ( when i heard the news ) yesterday but i do n't know the inside track			0
maybe i 'm thinking too purely and the long contract is n't there for him to see out			0
management is a survival game			0
@entity45 could leave in january after @entity91 and @entity92 declared an interest ' @entity4 fans will find out now how good @entity3 was , or not			0
' i know @entity4 fans have massive aspirations and they 're a good club but i think the money that has been spent ( during his reign ) , @entity3 has delivered par seasons and above - par seasons except the year they were in the @entity101			2
' he can see that @entity6 are a club he knows well and maybe can see an opportunity there			0
