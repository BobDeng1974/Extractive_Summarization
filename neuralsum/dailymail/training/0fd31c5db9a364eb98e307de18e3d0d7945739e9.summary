by @entity0 it 's often called the most important meal of the day , vital to set you up for hours of work or play			1
but , according to new research , @entity7 people are struggling to fit breakfast into their increasingly hectic schedules			0
a survey found the average person takes less than seven minutes to wolf down their morning meal and more than a third skip it altogether			2
only half eat breakfast every day , with 40 per cent telling researchers they have rushed the meal - with the average time taken just six minutes and 15 seconds			1
only half eat breakfast every day , with 40 per cent telling researchers they have rushed the meal - with the average time taken just six minutes and 15 seconds			1
the most common reasons are rushing to work ( 58 per cent ) , starting work too early ( 24 per cent ) , waking up late ( 18 per cent ) , being distracted by the children ( 16 per cent ) , the school run ( 14 per cent ) or a long commute ( 12 per cent )			1
two - thirds ( 65 per cent ) admit munching breakfast while getting ready , more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) eat in the car , while 15 per cent admit eating on public transport			2
weekends see the nation take the most time over breakfast , with an average of 13 minutes and two seconds spent enjoying the first meal of the day on saturdays and sundays			2
@entity50 ' ( left ) hit @entity51 is one of the top songs listened to at breakfast followed by the @entity54 ( right ) those who do make time for breakfast are more than likely to do so while listening to music ( 86 per cent ) to perk them up for the day ahead			1
the @entity54 - @entity60 3			2
@entity61 - a beautiful day 4			0
the @entity66 - mr @entity65 pop is the number one morning mood - lifting musical genre ( 60 per cent ) , with @entity50 ' chart - topper @entity51 ( 25 per cent ) named the ultimate track to accompany breakfast			1
however , nearly half ( 45 per cent ) say they do n't even have time to put the radio on in the morning			0
neuroscientist doctor @entity77 , co-author of @entity78 , said of the findings : ' music is one of the very best tools available to every one of us , enabling us to shift our brains into a different gear			0
' its mood - altering impacts are extremely well supported by decades ' worth of scientific research			0
using music to get us into the habit of making a little extra time each morning to give our brains the right fuel to kick start our day can only be a good thing			0
@entity98 he added : ' a nutritious breakfast is also brilliant for brain - hacking , which refers to simple adjustments to our behaviour that get our brains working better			0
' @entity106 , chief executive of @entity27 , added : ' a healthy breakfast makes starting the day a lot easier , so it 's a shame to see so many are rushing it , or even skipping it altogether			0
' it seems many are trying to eat as quickly as possible in the mornings , so the joy of sitting down to our most important meal is being forgotten .			1
