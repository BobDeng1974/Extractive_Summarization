by @entity1 reporter published : 14:11 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 4 august 2013 the man who confessed to one of the most infamous crimes in @entity6 's history may go free because authorities say there simply is n't enough evidence to win a prosecution			1
last year , @entity11 , 52 , confessed to murdering 6 - year - old @entity12 on may 25 , 1979 after luring him into the basement of a @entity15 bodega			2
once @entity16 was in the basement , @entity11 says he strangled the boy to death , put his body in a bag and then left him on the street in a pile of trash			1
the problem for prosecutors is that even though @entity11 has confessed , there 's no physical evidence or eyewitnesses linking him to the crime - and @entity16 's body has never been recovered ( it 's suspected it was hauled to a landfill )			1
did he do it ? other than a confession , there is no evidence that @entity11 had anything to do with @entity16 's death tragic : @entity12 disappeared in may of 1979 - when he was just 6 years old - while he was walking to school alone for the first time another challenge for prosecutors is @entity11 's mental state - according to his attorney , the alleged killer suffers from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder			1
' there ’s a consensus among prosecutors there that this case can not be won , ' a former prosecutor in the @entity52 ’s @entity51 told the @entity57			0
several members of the @entity60 's @entity59 continue to investigate the case looking for any piece of evidence to help prove that @entity11 is the killer - or that he 's not			1
' they ’ve interviewed these people over and over and over again			0
some of them five to 10 times			0
this has been going on for over a year			0
it ’s exhausting , ' a police source said			0
reopened : in 2010 , the @entity16 case was reopened , which led authorities to tear up a cement floor in @entity15 looking for a body			1
they found nothing @entity16 's disappearance received a lot of coverage in the media and continues to garner headlines			1
@entity16 was the first missing child featured on a milk carton			2
over the years , other suspects have emerged in the @entity16 case , most notably convicted child rapist @entity82 , who was a friend of a woman who 'd babysat the boy			0
@entity82 was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation and served a 20 - year prison sentence in @entity88			0
while incarcerated , a jailhouse snitch told authorities that @entity82 had confessed to him that he knew what happened to @entity16			2
however , it was n't enough evidence for prosecutors to pursue charges			0
despite no criminal charges , the @entity16 family sued @entity82 in civil court , where he was found to have been responsible for the boy 's death			2
the @entity16 's were awarded a ceremonial $ 2million , which they never attempted to collect			2
@entity11 was arrested after manhattan district attorney @entity104 reopened the case in 2010 and police started getting new leads , including calls from @entity11 's family members who said he 'd told them - and his priest - that he killed @entity16			1
suspect : until @entity11 's confession , child rapist @entity82 always was considered the prime suspect in @entity16 's disappearance during his videotaped confession to police , @entity11 asked the officers to kneel and pray alongside him , which they did			1
his attorney , @entity118 , says the officers ' praying with @entity11 was ' manipulative			2
' @entity118 is arguing that @entity11 's mental illness contributed to his making what he believes to be a false confession			1
' we are not admitting in any sense that he committed this crime			0
this is not a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity — ' ‘ i did it but i was crazy , ' ” @entity118 told @entity130			0
' he did n’t do it			0
he confessed to it , and it ’s the reliability of that confession that ’s the issue here			0
' regardless of whether @entity11 's confession is true , both prosecutors and the defense acknowledge that convicting him without any additional evidence will be challenging , if not impossible .			1

authorities worry they wo n't be able to convict @entity11 because there is no evidence other than his confession
@entity11 's attorney says his *client* 's mental illness caused him to falsely confess to killing @entity16
