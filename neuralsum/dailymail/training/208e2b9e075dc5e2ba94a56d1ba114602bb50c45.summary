by @entity0 for centuries @entity1 has claimed the rights as the inventor of the traditional pasty			1
marketed as a savoury snack which derived from the mining days , the county has long been associated with the humble pasty			1
but a historian has now threatened to upset the applecart by claiming to have found proof the traditional pasty was actually invented elsewhere - in the rivalling county of @entity14			1
marketed as a savoury snack which derived from the mining days , @entity1 has long been associated with the pasty			1
however , a historian has thrown a spanner in the works after claiming it actually came from @entity14 dr @entity21 claims four lines of texts in records dating back to the 16th century prove the ‘ world ’s first pasty recipe ’ was born in @entity25 , @entity14 – fuelling an ongoing food war between the two counties which already clash over the correct way to make a cream tea			1
he claims to have made the discovery after scouring the historic @entity33 in @entity25 for clues as to the origin of the food			2
he said one piece of text from records in 1509 , refers to the financial cost of making a pasty and the recipe used - some 236 years before there was any record of pasties in @entity1			1
traditionalists claim the pasty was originally made as lunch for @entity50 tin miners who were unable to return to the surface to eat			0
they were able to hold the pastry by the folded crust so the dirt did n’t touch the rest of their food , then discard that section afterwards			0
@entity14 pasties tend to have a crimped crust running along the top and are oval in shape while @entity50 pasties are semi-circular with a thicker crust running along the curved edge of the pasty			2
the term ' cornish pasty ' was given protected status by the @entity70 in 2011			0
it states that only pasties made in @entity1 from a traditional recipe can marketed as a ' cornish pasty '			1
the @entity75 applied for the special status , saying it wanted to protect the ' quality and reputation ' of the pasty			0
the @entity81 status means ' genuine ' cornish pasties are stamped with a special logo			0
the text , which says ' @entity85 for the cooke is labor to make the pasties ' , is said to be proof the @entity91 snack originated from @entity25 , which is separated from @entity1 by the @entity92			1
he said that while the intriguing text suggests inventors were using venison from the @entity99 estate just across the @entity92 in @entity1 , it proves the pasty actually originated in @entity14			1
he said the first reference to pasties he could find at the @entity103 was dated 1746 - more than two centuries after the records were logged in @entity25			2
the findings have been published in a book - the @entity108 – which features a collection of 100 ‘ quirky and fascinating nuggets ’ designed to attract visitors to the city			0
it has sparked a war of words between the two counties , which continue to dispute which way around cream and jam should be spread on the traditional cream tea			0
@entity121 , of the @entity75 , said : ‘ we produce the traditional @entity50 pasty			0
‘ the historical books say that the pasty originated in @entity1 , but obviously there is lots of information out there			1
‘ if you talk to consumers , which is what matters the most - they say it originated in @entity1			2
’ dr @entity21 claims to have found proof the traditional pasty was actually invented in @entity25 , @entity14 with records from the city , dating back to 1509 ( above ) , apparently referring to the financial cost of making a pasty some @entity14 claim the evidence is conclusive that the pasty - which makes @entity1 more than £ 60 million a year – originated in @entity25			1
however , @entity144 , owner of the @entity145 in @entity25 , conceded that pasties would always be more closely associated with @entity1			1
he said : ‘ everyone would associate the origins of a pasty with @entity1 - it ’s a @entity50 pasty			2
‘ there are variations in terms of the styles that are made in @entity14			2
‘ i do n’t think it ’s a big problem , it ’s not really going to affect people ’s decision about whether or not to buy a pasty			0
‘ it ’s an interesting fact that will make the book even more fascinating if you ’re living in @entity25			2
‘ it ’s a nice little feather in the cap of @entity165 to say that really the pasty actually originated in @entity25			1
' the @entity50 claim the jam should be spread first on the scone , while those in @entity14 claim cream should always come first a battle has raged for years over the origins of the cream tea , with both @entity14 and @entity1 claiming to be the real birthplace of the tradition			1
and while the dispute continues to wager on , both counties remain divided over the ‘ right ’ way to load up the quintessentially @entity180 afternoon treat			0
in @entity14 , the scone is split into two and loaded with large helpings of locally - sourced clotted cream before a dollop of jam is placed on top			0
meanwhile , the @entity50 believe the proper way to serve a scone is to first spread the jam before finishing it with a blob of clotted cream			0
the age - old debate has rumbled on for years , with both counties attempting to justify their method as correct			0
some say the @entity50 way helps the cream stay on without sliding off , while @entity14 defend their method by claiming it allows more cream to be spread on the scone .			0

historian claims records from 1509 prove pasty came from @entity25 , @entity14
@entity1 has long been associated with savoury snack since mining days
dr @entity21 now claims the ' world *'s* first pasty recipe ' originated in @entity14
