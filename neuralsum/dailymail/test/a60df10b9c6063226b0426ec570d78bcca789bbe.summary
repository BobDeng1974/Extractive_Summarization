@entity0 said modern pop stars are part of a ' selfie generation ' that just sings about platitudes he was once the driving force behind @entity6 in the 1990s and became known for his very public spat with @entity10 ' @entity9 brothers			1
and now @entity11 frontman @entity0 , who lives in @entity12 and @entity13 in @entity14 , has returned to pick a fight with even more people in the music industry			1
@entity0 has criticised today 's pop stars for ' talking platitudes ' and singing only about themselves , at a time when , he believes , they could be using their music to make political statements in the run up to the general election			1
the 47 - year - old dubbed modern pop artists as existing in a ' selfie generation ' of stars who use their music to reveal only how they feel			2
' modern day musicians are talking platitudes now and it 's not interesting to me , ' @entity0 told the @entity32 ' culture magazine			1
his comments are timely as @entity11 releases its first album in years this month			1
@entity0 's criticisms are also likely to resonate with people who have been scornful about the work of modern day pop stars such as @entity39 and @entity40 who are known for using their singles to express their emotions about failed relationships			1
' what are any of them saying ? ' added @entity0 , now a father - of - one			2
' i do n't hear them saying anything other than " this is me and this is how i feel , " which is an important part of songwriting , but we 're talking in the context of an election			0
' @entity11 shot to success with @entity59 in 1995 - widely seen as a commentary about growing up in the 1990s and the ordinary people that many forgot about			2
they became one of the best known bands in pop , fuelled by a very public row with rivals @entity10			0
but by 2002 @entity69 - best friend of @entity0 - was asked to leave the band and they all began to do their own projects			2
in 2009 they reunited to play @entity73 and again in 2012			0
@entity40 , recently credited the man who broke his heart for inspiring his award winning album @entity39 is known for using her music to criticise her ex-boyfriends and reveal her struggles in love @entity0 said he would like to see popstars talking about what is going on around them and using their music to comment on modern society and politics			1
he is characteristically forthright about his own political stance			0
the @entity11 frontman longs to see a @entity91 and @entity90 government , and dismisses an incident in the 1990s when @entity93 tried to recruit him as an incident when he was young and new to politics , and still did not know his own political mind			0
he would also like to see @entity97 significantly reduced			0
@entity102 ( left ) , @entity99 ( centre , top ) , guitarist @entity69 ( right ) and @entity0 ( centre front ) were one of the best known boybands in the 1990s and have reunited to produced a new album @entity11 release their new album @entity107 later this month			1
it is the first time since the 1999 album , entitled 13 , that @entity69 will feature fully on the album			0
@entity111 was created in two sections - the first after they reunited to play in @entity73 in 2009 and went on a world tour - finding time in @entity115 to come up with some new material			0
@entity69 worked on the songs and they returned to @entity115 again to complete the album .			0
