it ’s widely accepted than in 5 billion years our @entity1 will collide with the nearby @entity3 - but what will happen when it does ? in a new simulation scientists have revealed the intricate process that will take place , with the two central supermassive black holes merging into one			1
and the newly formed super-galaxy , dubbed ‘ @entity11 ’ , will also ultimately spell disaster for @entity13 as our planet is flung out into interstellar space			1
a simulation ( shown ) created by the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) in @entity20 has revealed the formation of ' @entity11 '			1
this is the name given to the super-galaxy that will be created when the @entity1 and @entity3 collide in 5 billion years the simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) in @entity20			1
in the simulation it can be seen how the two galaxies will interact as they approach each other			0
first , in a tentative meeting , they will ‘ swoop ’ past each other , possibly disrupting some of the orbits of stars in the arms of each spiral galaxy			0
then , after separating , the two galaxies will accelerate towards each other again			0
the @entity1 is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains about 300 billion stars			1
this makes it a ‘ middleweight ’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known , @entity44 , containing more than 100 trillion stars			0
on a clear night , when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the @entity13 is about 2,500 stars			0
like more than two - thirds of the known galaxies , the @entity1 has a spiral shape			0
at the centre of the spiral , a lot of energy and , occasionally , vivid flares are created			0
based on the immense gravity that would be required to explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled , the centre of the @entity1 is thought to have a supermassive black hole like many other galaxies in the universe			1
as @entity3 is larger than the @entity1 , with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter , it will technically be the one ‘ eating ’ our galaxy			1
the @entity1 is also expected to ‘ eat ’ two nearby dwarf galaxies , the large and @entity74 , at some point in the future			0
and studies have also suggested the third largest galaxy in our @entity79 , called the @entity80 or @entity80 , may also be involved in the collision of the @entity1 and @entity3			2
in the video , gas is shown in blue and newly formed stars in red - meaning those that formed over the duration of the simulation			0
‘ as the galaxies come together , mutual gravity leads to gas and stars being flung out in the form of tidal arms , ’ dr @entity89 of @entity19 explains			1
‘ the first passage does little damage to the galaxies ; it 's on the second and subsequent encounters that gravitational interactions have most effect , with huge clouds of gas undergoing shocks and collapsing to create bursts of star formation that lead to powerful supernovae - driven winds			2
‘ at late times , gas that was expelled from the galaxy falls back in and settles into a rapidly rotating compact disc			0
‘ although we show only the newly formed stars , the stellar discs and bulges of the @entity1 and @entity3 will have merged to form a massive elliptical galaxy , shaped like a rugby ball			1
’ as @entity3 ( right ) is larger than the @entity1 ( left ) , with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter , it will technically be the one ‘ eating ’ our galaxy			1
the @entity1 is also expected to ‘ eat ’ two nearby dwarf galaxies , the large and @entity74 , at some point in the future the data for the research was collected by the @entity126 in @entity127 as part of the @entity131 and @entity132 ( @entity130 ) survey , which involves more than 90 scientists and took more than seven years to complete			2
owing to the huge distances between stars , it ’s unlikely that any two will collide			2
for example , the nearest star to our own sun is @entity142 , 4.2 light years away			0
if the sun were the size of a ping pong ball , @entity142 would be a pea about 680 miles ( 1,100km ) away			0
with the average distance between stars being 100 billion miles ( 160 billion km ) , it ’s unlikely any two will collide when the merger happens			0
nonetheless , its likely that the supermassive black hole at the centre of each galaxy will converge			1
these will converge near the centre of @entity11 , transferring additional orbital energy to stars over millions of years			2
some simulations predict that this event will see @entity13 brought nearer the centre of the combined galaxy before being flung out of the super-galaxy			1
ultimately , gravity is expected to cause all the galaxies in bound groups and clusters in the universe to merge into a few super-giant galaxies like this , although it will be many billions of years before this takes place			0
is this what the collision will look like from @entity13 ? as @entity3 approaches it will become much larger in the night sky before merging with the @entity1			1
some simulations predict that this event will see @entity13 brought nearer the centre of the combined galaxy before being flung out of the new super-galaxy			2

a simulation created by the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) in @entity20 shows the formation of ' @entity11 '
this is the name given to the super-galaxy that will be created when the @entity1 and @entity3 collide in 5 billion years
the event will see the two galaxies merge into one with a huge supermassive black hole at their core
it 's unlikely any stars will collide *due* to the great distances between them
@entity13 may ultimately be flung out of the new super-galaxy , however
