by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:40 am on 16th november 2011 @entity2 made an abject apology for ‘ shameful ’ phone hacking by the @entity5 at the public inquiry into press standards yesterday			1
a lawyer for the company said that the newspaper , closed earlier this year , had reached both ‘ the depths and the heights ’ of journalism			1
@entity14 said that the company now accepted that phone hacking may have gone on after 2007 – when the paper ’s royal editor @entity16 was jailed – and went beyond a ‘ single rogue reporter ’			1
guilty : @entity16 , left , was jailed in 2007 along with private detective @entity19 , right			2
@entity20 ' may have continued ' at the paper after the cases but he said the paper also produced major investigations , such as the @entity26 cricket fixing affair , a scandal initially ignored by police			1
contrition : @entity2 's lawyer @entity14 from monday the inquiry will hear from 21 witnesses , including film and tv stars and relatives of crime victims , who will tell of the impact of having their phone messages intercepted or their privacy intruded upon by the @entity40			1
the first live evidence is expected to come from the family of murdered schoolgirl @entity43			2
allegations that @entity47 ’s voicemail was hacked on behalf of the @entity5 after her disappearance triggered the public outrage that led @entity50 to launch a public inquiry into the @entity40			2
among those expected to appear , the inquiry heard , are @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , who was wrongly suspected of @entity65 ’s murder			2
a further 30 ‘ core participants ’ will submit evidence in the form of written statements			2
yesterday mr @entity70 said : ‘ it is right that at the formal opening of this inquiry and in public , i should repeat on behalf of @entity2 the apologies that have been made to all those whose phones were hacked or whose families , friends or associates ’ phones were hacked , by or at the behest of staff working at the @entity5			1
‘ that phone hacking was wrong			1
it should never have happened			2
probe : a policeman walks through the security gates at @entity2 's @entity89 plant in @entity90 earlier this year ‘ @entity2 apologises for it unreservedly			1
denial : the @entity93 ' did not ' hack into the phone of @entity95 , pictured ‘ we accept that there was no public interest justification for it and we further accept that it was not the subject of a proper and thorough investigation until the @entity102 began @entity103 in january this year , following the supply of certain material to them by @entity2			1
’ but he added : ‘ @entity108 , the @entity5 managed to plumb both the depths and the heights			0
the depths , i need hardly say , are taken up by phone hacking			1
‘ the heights are well illustrated by the remarkable piece of investigative journalism which exposed very recently the willingness of international cricketers to take money to fix events in cricket matches and led to the convictions of three cricketers			0
‘ it was an investigation which no private citizen could have taken on , and which no government organ or professional body showed any inclination to take on			0
’ mr @entity70 described the commissioning of a former detective to carry out numerous surveillance operations for the paper as ‘ wholly unacceptable ’ and ‘ not journalism ’			0
but he added : ‘ not everyone who worked at the @entity5 was involved			0
there were many fine reporters and staff who worked at that newspaper who had no involvement in phone hacking and who have suffered in the fallout			1
’ mr @entity70 said he ‘ was surprised ’ by claims from @entity143 , counsel to the inquiry , that 27 @entity2 employees were involved in commissioning investigator @entity19 to phone hack and said ‘ our understanding is it certainly does not add up to 27 ’			1
he also disputed mr @entity149 ’s claims that @entity95 ’s phone was hacked ‘ by or for the @entity93 ’			1
the whole of the @entity40 must not be tarnished by the illegal activities at the @entity5 , the inquiry was urged			0
@entity154 , counsel for @entity155 , which publishes the @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , said : ‘ we are anxious that the allegations of phone hacking should not be allowed to besmirch the profession as a whole			1
’ he told @entity164 : ‘ we need to be clearly aware that any recommendations or restrictions which come out of this inquiry are not simply introduced on the basis of historic transgressions which no longer occur			0
’ setting out the position of the newspaper group , mr @entity170 added : ‘ it condemns the practice of phone hacking , and so far as it is aware , no journalist at @entity155 has engaged in phone hacking			1
‘ it does not bribe police officers and , in particular , it condemns the shameful practice of hacking the mobile phones of the victims of crime or of their families			2
’ he told the inquiry : ‘ of course there is always room for improvement , and for better practices			0
‘ we do wish , however , to stress that @entity40 standards have vastly improved over the last 20 years under the @entity188 and under the @entity189 ’ @entity190			0
‘ most journalists are hard - working , conscientious and honest , and they passionately believe in what they do			0
’ mr @entity170 went on : ‘ no one involved in this inquiry or outside this room could seriously doubt that a free press , which is independent of government , is essential to any democracy			0
’ he said the @entity156 and its sister paper the @entity157 are successful because they connect with their readership and their values , and went on : ‘ that readership will stop buying those newspapers if they feel that they can not trust its integrity or accuracy			0
’ referring to @entity209 , an investigation by the information commissioner into inquiry agent @entity212 , who was commissioned by most national papers , including the @entity156 , the barrister said : ‘ the activity which @entity212 was hired to undertake almost a decade ago was primarily to obtain addresses and telephone numbers , most of which could legally have been obtained if the individual had had the time to research it			0
‘ it should also be stressed that mr @entity212 did not work simply for newspapers			0
he was hired by organisations such as banks , local authorities and firms of solicitors who similarly were seeking to locate people			0
’ after the information commissioner ’s report into @entity212 was published in 2006 , @entity229 , editor - in - chief of @entity155 , banned the use of all inquiry agents , said mr @entity170 , and all @entity155 journalists are required to abide by the @entity189 ’ @entity190 .			0

@entity20 may have gone on after 2007 , company admit
phone hacking did go beyond a single rogue reporter , @entity2 lawyer says
the @entity93 will deny they hacked into @entity95 's phone
