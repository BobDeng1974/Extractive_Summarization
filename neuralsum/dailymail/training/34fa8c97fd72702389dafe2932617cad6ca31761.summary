by @entity0 @entity2 manager @entity1 has vowed not to ' park the bus ' against @entity4 on saturday as he relishes testing his side against @entity7 's title favourites			1
last season 's @entity9 winners will look to build on an opening - day draw with @entity12 when they go to west @entity13 this weekend			1
@entity1 accepts any kind of result they can get will be a bonus and therefore hopes his side can play with a degree of freedom			1
tactics : @entity1 says he will not park the bus against @entity4 in the @entity23 this weekend ' i 'm looking forward to taking @entity2 to @entity4 in the league rather than the cup , ' said @entity1 , whose side lost 5 - 2 in an @entity29 quarter - final in 2012			1
' the most important thing is i want to see how our players cope with a big fixture			2
it 's important for us to play the game and not the occasion			1
' @entity4 at @entity37 speaks for itself			1
their record there is very good but we have to think of this as something of a bonus			2
' not many people give us much hope but we have a strong resolve			2
if we can be an awkward customer i 'll be happy			0
but we have some good footballers			0
confidence : @entity1 insisted his team had some strong players and could be an ' awkward customer ' ' we may be need a bit of time for our players to dictate the tempo a bit better			1
there are a lot of counter-attacking sides in the @entity23			0
' i do n't want us to just soak pressure			0
we need to give each other enough options to maximise our offensive players			0
' while @entity1 may be intrigued to pit his side against the @entity67 , he has less interest in his own ' battle ' with @entity7			1
' i have a huge respect for @entity7 , ' he said			1
' i do n't see it as a duel between managers			0
i see it as about how to be competitive as a team			0
how others want to bill it is up to them			0
' respect : @entity1 said he has ' huge respect ' for the @entity4 manager as the two sides prepare to meet @entity1 , who may be able to welcome back @entity82 ( thigh ) and @entity84 ( groin ) for the match , insists his job has barely changed since reaching the top flight			1
' it feels like it always does , ' he said			0
' i 'm managing the same people			0
the problems and challenges are different but it is all about managing the expectations in terms of excitement generated			0
it 's been a long time since we were in the @entity23			2
' it 's important for people to enjoy the experience but we will only do that by performing as well as we can			2
' i do n't see my job to be fundamentally different			0
i 'm very pleased to be the manager of a side that has achieved promotion with style			2
' it 's not an easy thing to do and for us to establish ourselves as a @entity23 side it will take a lot of hard work and patience			1
' opener : @entity2 earned an impressive 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity12 in their @entity23 opener it ’s not too late to play @entity123 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			1

@entity1 says @entity2 will not park the bus against @entity4
