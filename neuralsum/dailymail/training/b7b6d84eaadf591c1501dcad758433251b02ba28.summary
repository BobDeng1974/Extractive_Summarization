but the devastated couple refused - despite doctors ’ fears that the baby would not survive the birth			2
however , despite a difficult birth and surgery at just eight - hours old , followed by four more operations , young @entity21 recovered			1

they said he probably would n’t make it through the pregnancy , and even if he did , would n’t survive long after birth			0
' we were devastated - but @entity10 and i just turned to each other and we knew straight away there was no way either of us was going to give up on our baby			0
' the rest of my pregnancy was terrifying - i lived in fear of something going wrong			0
' when i went into labour , @entity21 ’s heart stopped every time i had a contraction - we nearly lost him so many times			1
but he ’s a tough little boy and he ’s amazed all of us - he ’s so strong , and we are so proud of him			2
' the couple had no idea there were any complications with @entity9 ’s pregnancy until their 21 week scan - when nurses struggled to hear the heartbeat clearly			1
@entity9 was booked in for a specialist scan a week later at the @entity69 , @entity70 , where the stunned couple were told the extent of @entity21 ’s condition			1
they were warned their unborn child was suffering from a back - to - front valves , a large hole in the heart , as well as various conditions that made his arteries thick and made it difficult for blood to pump around the body			1
@entity21 , when he was a few days old : his heart stopped several times during his birth @entity21 was well enough at seven months to act as pageboy at his parents wedding @entity9 said : ' the nurse ’s face just dropped , and she went out of the room to get a doctor			1
' i knew something was wrong and i just burst into tears before they had even told us what was @entity100 was the worst feeling i ’ve ever experienced in my @entity102 doctors said our baby ’s heart was struggling to pump blood around his body , and he had so many complications he would n’t live			2
' they said they ’d never seen anything like it - having so many conditions was totally unheard of			2
' they took us into a little room and advised us to terminate the pregnancy - but there was no way we would even consider it			0
' they agreed to monitor me closely throughout the rest of the pregnancy , but it was terrifying			0
i was always thinking the worst was going to happen , but @entity10 kept me positive and was my rock			0
' i was induced and went into labour on christmas eve , and it lasted 15 terrifying hours before doctors decided to perform an emergency caesarean on christmas day 2010			2
' i heard this little scream and the nurses held him up for me to see before he was whisked away			0
i remember seeing his big beautiful eyes and just pleading that he would keep fighting			0
' little fighter : @entity21 , bearing the chest scar following his heart operation @entity21 was just eight hours old when he had his first heart surgery - an operation inserting a small balloon into enable his heart to pump blood through his arteries			1
his parents kept a vigil by his bedside , and when he was just five days old , he underwent further operation to insert a shunt into his arteries			1
and his terrified parents almost lost him again following an mri scan when he was four months old - where the tot reacted violently to anaesthesis used to put him to sleep , causing his heart rate to shoot up to 260			1
@entity9 added : ' after his first operation , the surgeon came out and said to us he had no idea how @entity21 was still here - he said it was a real miracle			1
' we just spent every minute by his side			0
he was recovering from his second operation on @entity160 , and all the fireworks were going off outside the @entity162 , just across the river from the hospital			0
' the nurses kept asking if we wanted to go outside and watch , but we just wanted to stay with our little boy			0
it was the best @entity168 i ’ve ever had , the three of us together			0
' after five months in hospital , @entity21 was finally able to go home - and was even well enough to be pageboy at his parents ’ wedding in july 2011			1
and despite needing a further three operations in the last twelve months , doctors are amazed by @entity21 ’s progress - and say he is doing much better than expected			1
although he will need to have further operations in the future to replace shunts as he grows , medics are confident that @entity21 will be able to lead a normal life			2
@entity10 said : ' i just ca n’t thank all the doctors and nurses at @entity188 ’s hospital enough			0
if it was n’t for their hard work and dedication , we probably would n’t have our little boy - we ’ll always be in their debt			2
' we are just two normal people - we do n’t drink a lot , we do n’t do drugs , we ’re quiet living - we could n’t understand why this had happened to us or how to deal with it			0
