the parents of teenagers who flee @entity3 to join @entity4 should take more responsibility for their children 's actions , a senior police officer has said			1
sir @entity8 , one of the country 's leading counter terrorism officers , said families are more to blame for young jihadis who runaway to @entity14 than the police , schools or local authorities			1
rather than report their concerns to police for fear of being criticised , some parents are guilty of embracing ' victimhood ' when their children leave , he claimed			1
@entity36 , 16 , @entity37 and @entity38 , both 15 , fled their north @entity40 homes in february			1
they are thought to have joined former classmate @entity42 in the @entity4 stronghold of @entity44			1
their families have since lambasted police for not warning them that @entity42 had earlier travelled to @entity14			1
but sir @entity8 has slammed their ' ill - advised ' condemnation which he says could lead to a ' backlash '			1
a senior police officer claimed the families of runaway jihadis were embracing ' victimhood '			1

' i 'm not saying that is easy			0
but it creates the conditions for a backlash which again is not positive			0

' as parents , we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care			1
' had we been made aware of circumstances sooner , we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the @entity3			0
