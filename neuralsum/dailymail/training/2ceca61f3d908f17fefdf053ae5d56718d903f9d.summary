if @entity2 defensive end @entity1 does n’t win the mvp award this year , there wo n’t be anyone more disappointed than @entity6 ' @entity5			1
the seven - year - old peewee football player has modelled his game after the @entity10 star and he plans to play in the league just like his idol			1
@entity6 detailed his exploits on the football field to in a letter to @entity1 and also sent the 25 - year - old his autographed no 99 jersey so he would be able to ‘ know me when i am a famous @entity10 player			1
’ @entity1 , who is unfazed by competing against crafty quarterbacks , aggressive offensive linemen and even other defensive players while serving as a tight end , was impressed by what young @entity6 had to say			1
‘ this kid has some guts ... i like it , ’ @entity1 wrote after posting a copy of the letter and a picture of @entity6 ’s jersey on his @entity27 account			1
the 2012 @entity31 may like the guts he sees from @entity6 , but @entity1 has certainly shown some intestinal fortitude of his own this @entity10 season			2
will it be enough to win him an mvp ? @entity1 has 16.5 sacks , 10 pass breakups and 64 total tackles this season to go along with three forced fumbles , an interception and five touchdowns			1
the scores have n’t all come on defense as @entity1 has caught three tds as a tight end , but even his two defensive scores ( one on an interception return and the other on a fumble recovery ) are equal to the number of times @entity55 , a running back for sunday ’s opponent the @entity58 , has reached paydirt this season			1
@entity1 has had a tremendous season with the @entity2 on both sides of the ball @entity2 would not even be close to its 7 - 7 record without @entity1 and he likely is the most valuable player to his team in the truest sense of the word			1
unfortunately there have only been two defensive players to receive the award ( @entity72 linebacker @entity71 in 1986 and @entity73 defensive tackle @entity74 in 1971 ) and a quarterback or running back has walked away with an mvp trophy for 27 consecutive seasons			0
for his part , @entity1 says it does n’t matter to him			2
‘ that 's for people like you to decide , not me , ' @entity1 told mmqb '			2
' i ca n't change any voters ' minds , and i do n't think i should try			0
i do n't care , actually			0
it does n't matter to me			0
‘ if people vote for me , great			0
but to politic for it , no. please vote for me ? no. people who play do n't get to decide who wins , nor should they			0
i want to be deserving , but not because i politicked for it			0
my play on the field is all that should matter			0
’ only time will tell if @entity1 will walk away with the award			0
if he does n’t , it may be a long time until another defensive player even comes close … possibly until around the year 2030 when @entity101 is terrorising the league .			2

@entity101 sent 25 - year - old @entity1 a letter and an autographed game jersey
the young *fan* plays defensive end and tight end just like @entity1
defensive end has 16.5 sacks , 10 pass breakups and 64 total tackles this season
in addition to forcing three fumbles , @entity1 has an interception and five touchdowns
