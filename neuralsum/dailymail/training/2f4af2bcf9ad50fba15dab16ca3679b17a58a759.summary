@entity0 will have to wait			1
his midfield talisman and his expensive new signing are staying in @entity3 a little longer			0
they are both yet to impress at this @entity5 , but @entity6 and @entity7 are into the quarter - finals to face @entity9 , rather than flying back to @entity10 to play @entity11			1
but it was not down to a significant contribution from either man that the @entity15 progressed			2
indeed , @entity6 was withdrawn 10 minutes from time , with a possibly worrying injury			2
@entity15 winger @entity18 ( left ) watches as his shot hits the back of @entity22 's net after 35 minutes @entity24 winger @entity18 celebrates passionately after giving his country the lead on wednesday night @entity27 ( no 15 ) celebrates with his team - mates including @entity6 and @entity7 in the first half @entity22 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity30 ; @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ; @entity35 ( @entity36 46 mins ) ; @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 67 ) ; @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 56 ) subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 @entity15 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 27 ) , @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity6 ( @entity61 82 ) @entity62 ; @entity18 ; @entity63 ( @entity64 60 ) , @entity7 subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 booked : @entity56 , @entity6 , @entity54 goal : @entity18 but progress was ensure by @entity18 , who won the game with a goal that could easily be the best we see all tournament			1
having robbed @entity31 of possession on the left wing , the former @entity80 winger cut inside and lashed a vicious shot at goal from 25 yards			0
the pace , swerve and accuracy of the shot saw it beat the otherwise excellent @entity88 , finding the corner of the net beyond the despairing goalkeeper 's dive			0
@entity15 , ahead for the first time in the competition , sat back on their lead , inviting pressure from a @entity22 side who knew that defeat would see them crash out			1
but aside from a flurry of chances late in the first half , the previously leaky @entity15 defence held firm			0
and they should really have wrapped the game up on the break , @entity109 firing meekly at @entity30 before @entity111 's new striker fluffed a chance to seal the win			1
in @entity7 's defence he did brilliantly to hold off the scarcely legal challenge of @entity32 , to get his shot away , but having escaped the defender 's clutches his finish was not of the standard you would expect from a Â£ 28million forward			2
@entity15 midfielder @entity6 ( right ) tussles with @entity22 's @entity41 in @entity122 @entity111 new boy @entity7 ( right ) rises highest to win a header against @entity124 @entity125 defender @entity55 ( right ) attempts to block a shot from @entity22 's @entity127 there were 61 fouls during @entity15 's win against @entity22 - the most ever recorded by @entity131 in an @entity5 game			1
substitute @entity64 almost manufactured himself a late goal as well , but it would not matter as the @entity134 held on			0
both sides had come into the game desperate to avoid the complicated possibility of drawing lots , with @entity125 defender @entity55 promising that after two disappointing performances we would see ' the real @entity15 ' in this deciding game			0
and his team - mates seemed determined to prove him right , producing comfortably their most incisive football of the tournament so far , against what , on paper at least , ought to have been their toughest opponents			0
at the heart of everything was @entity18 , the livewire winger who was only given his chance in this competition because of @entity153 's mindless red card in the first game against @entity3			1
@entity18 came off the bench in the second match against @entity157 , and earned himself a place in the starting line - up with a late equaliser			2
@entity56 of the @entity15 ( left ) cuts back under pressure from @entity22 midfielder @entity127 @entity58 ( left ) goes down as he attempts to challenge @entity22 's @entity39 @entity7 is held back by @entity32 as he attempts to burst through on goal in @entity122 against @entity22 he fully justified that selection , creating early chances for @entity7 and @entity6 before scoring his wonderful opener			1
@entity7 in particular should have done better with his chance in just the fifth minute , but he could only meet an awkward cross with his thigh , and @entity168 keeper @entity88 was able to react quickly and push the effort away			2
toure was also denied by the 19 - year - old keeper after powering a header low and on target midway through the first half , as the @entity175 created more clear - cut chances in the first 20 minutes than their first two matches			0
but it was after falling behind to @entity18 's thunderstrike that @entity22 began to create chances of their own , the best two of which fell to @entity127			2
@entity15 's players including @entity7 ( left ) and @entity71 celebrate after the final whistle @entity185 ( left ) keeps his eyes focused on the ball as @entity6 closes him down the @entity22 winger beat the @entity15 offside trap just moments after his side had fallen behind only to fire straight at @entity54 , and had another great opportunity on the stroke of half - time			1
a brilliant run from @entity39 opened up the @entity134 's defence , his pass released @entity35 , whose first touch took him beyond the defence and into the box			0
but , once again , having done the hard work , his shot was poor , blasting over the bar when he should really have scored			0
it was no surprise when @entity35 was hooked at the interval , but his replacement @entity36 did little to spark a recovery			0
the introduction of @entity210 winger @entity209 did at least lift the crowd , but not the standard of attacking play , and the @entity175 held out for their place in the quarter - final .			1

*ex-leeds* winger @entity18 scored in the 35th minute to seal *victory*
@entity15 face @entity9 in the quarter - finals of the @entity5
@entity111 duo @entity6 and @entity7 will not face @entity11
@entity0 's side travel to @entity225 on *saturday*
