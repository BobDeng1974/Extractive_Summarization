it is 4am , the old centre back has not slept a wink			2
his mind is racing ; training drills , team selection , travel plans			2
it is now 6am , still without any sleep but energised and excited , the young coach is up and ready for the day ahead , his first as a football manager			0
@entity12 – the @entity13 defender , reserve - team coach and caretaker boss - is 37 years old			1
@entity12 is in temporary charge at @entity13 following the departure of @entity18 earlier this month the club 's form has picked up since @entity12 took control , and last week they beat @entity22 2 - 1 away @entity12 currently fulfills the roles of defender , reserve - team coach and caretaker manager at @entity13 he is both a veteran – 593 professional appearances – and a rookie , now 12 days and two games in to his temporary tenure			1
he is also one of just eight englishmen under 40 currently taking charge of a @entity34 club			1
none of those won an international cap			2
only two of them – @entity40 and @entity41 – played in the @entity34 , albeit a handful of times			1
so where are those trophy - laden @entity46 stars ? why are n’t they taking on the challenge at @entity48 ? answer : they do n’t need it			1
@entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 – they do n’t need @entity57 away on a wet tuesday night , they do n’t even need @entity58 away on a sunny saturday afternoon			1
@entity59 boss @entity40 is currently the youngest manager in the @entity34 and will turn 36 in march @entity60 boss @entity41 is one of eight englishmen under the age of 40 taking charge of a @entity34 club the likes of @entity52 and @entity53 do n't need to travel to @entity57 on a cold and wet tuesday night rather , the next generation of @entity46 coaches – an endangered species according to @entity70 reports – are guys like @entity12			1
a father of four , he needs it			0
more importantly , he wants it			0
‘ if i ’m asked to do this job , then i would love to , ’ says the man who has scribbled a dossier on training sessions and tactics garnered from a 20 - year playing career and geared towards this day			1
‘ i ’ve always wanted to be a coach and a manager			0
i ’ve said it since i was in my 20s			0
people used to think i was daft			0
but this is what i ’ve always wanted to do			0
yeah , my phone has n’t stopped and i ’ve hardly slept , but i ’m loving every minute			0
’ @entity12 – who will complete his @entity89 next summer - adds : ‘ i think it is players like myself who are the @entity46 coaches of the future			1
‘ look at @entity93 at @entity94 , he ’s the perfect example - players from the lower leagues with a lot of experience			2
so there is a place there for young coaches but you need that chance because i still think there are too many foreign managers and players in @entity46 football			1
’ @entity111 boss @entity110 agrees that managers that work their way up are the future of @entity117 coaching in his latest book , a man walks on to a pitch , @entity110 says @entity123 manager @entity122 could not have matched @entity125 's achievements at @entity126 in recent seasons @entity110 agrees with @entity12			1
in his new book , a man walks on to a pitch , he writes : ‘ @entity122 could n’t have done a better job with @entity126 than @entity125 did last year			2
yet did his heroics in the @entity34 and @entity134 create even a ripple at @entity136 ? ‘ ok , a few times in his career it has n’t worked out but that would be true of @entity141 , too , if he had spent his managerial life at clubs like @entity144 , @entity145 or @entity126			1
i do n’t understand why owners suddenly lost faith in @entity117 managers			2
‘ and where ’s the next generation of @entity46 managers coming from ? will the current top tier of @entity46 players go through the leagues to prove themselves , as @entity125 has done ? lads who have had 10 seasons at @entity158 in the @entity159 years wo n’t get out of bed for what the manager of @entity22 gets paid			1
’ or , indeed , for what the manager of @entity13 gets paid			1
they are now searching for their fifth boss in three years			0
among the applications there will be those from abroad and former @entity171 chief @entity170 is one of the frontrunners			0
even @entity173 expressed an interest two years ago			0
but perhaps their best bet already resides within the @entity177			0
former defender @entity18 quit @entity13 following a 3 - 0 home defeat to @entity179 in october @entity13 were without a win in five and bottom of the @entity182 when @entity18 quit earlier this month			1
there is dissatisfaction among fans			0
they have threatened to boycott the next home game in protest against @entity190 owners @entity191 and a perceived lack of investment in the playing squad			0
none of that , however , will deter @entity12 – and many others – from putting forward their case to be installed on a permanent basis			1
the caretaker ’s accent is on youth , evidenced by an xi which included five players 21 or under during saturday ’s 2 - 1 victory at @entity22 , a result which lifted the gloom and elevated their league standing by three places			1
they entertain @entity211 this weekend , but not before @entity12 took the reserves to @entity213 on wednesday afternoon			1
he is already immersed in the role			0
‘ i love this club			2
i ’ve been here a long time and i know how the fans think , ’ says the @entity216 - born defender who signed from @entity126 in 2008			2
@entity12 congratulates @entity219 after @entity13 's victory away to @entity22 on october 11 ‘ @entity13 is the same as where i ’m from – working - class people who want their team to have effort , energy and determination			1
i ’m from that background and i understand it			0
‘ the young lads here are honest , hard - working and desperate to do well			2
i ’m not afraid to play them one little bit			0
i know what they ’re capable of			0
‘ as soon as i was asked by the chairman to take care of things then i knew within 10 minutes who i wanted to play			0
‘ one lad , @entity236 , came up to me and gave me a hug when i told him he was going to make his debut and he did the same after the game			0
he ’s infectious and desperate to be a footballer			0
’ @entity12 , too , shares the hunger of his young player			1
for while he may not be sleeping , it has n’t stopped him dreaming of becoming the club ’s manager .			2

@entity12 took over at @entity13 after @entity18 quit the club
he is one of eight @entity46 managers under 40 in the @entity182
only two have @entity34 *pedigree* , @entity41 and @entity40
the likes of @entity53 , @entity52 and @entity55 will never have to work their way up from the bottom like @entity12 is at @entity13
when the 37 - year - old took over , the club were bottom of the @entity182 and had not won in their previous five *fixtures*
@entity12 has overseen a defeat to @entity144 and a win at @entity22
