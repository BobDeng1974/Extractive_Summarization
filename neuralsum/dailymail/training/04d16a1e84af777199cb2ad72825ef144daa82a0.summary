it contained @entity4 â€™s obsessive research - in nine - point font - about mass murders of the past , and even attempted murders			1
among the tragedies @entity4 studied were the 2006 mass shooting carried out by @entity27 in which he killed five @entity29 school girls as well as the 2011 massacre of 77 people in @entity32 by @entity33			1
investigators revealed they have found reams of articles about multiple shootings , leading them to speculate he intended to outdo them all			2
police have also discovered evidence that @entity4 became extremely efficient in his mastery of his ar - 15 bushmaster assault rifle - leading them believe he had been planning his assault for a long time			1
officers outlined the findings at the @entity48 and @entity49 mid-year meeting in @entity51 last week , a law enforcement veteran told the @entity52			0
according to the officer : ' we were told ( @entity54 ) had around 500 people on this sheet			2
names and the number of people killed and the weapons that were used , even the precise make and model of the weapons			1
' it had to have taken years			0
it sounded like a doctoral thesis , that was the quality of the research			0
' they do n't believe this was just a spreadsheet			0
they believe it was a score sheet , ' he continued			0
' this was the work of a video gamer , and that it was his intent to put his own name at the very top of that list			0
' they believe that he picked an elementary school because he felt it was a point of least resistance , where he could rack up the greatest number of kills			0
that 's what ( the @entity91 police ) believe			0
' they believe that ( @entity4 ) believed that it was the way to pick up the easiest points			1
it 's why he did n't want to be killed by law enforcement			1
' in the code of a gamer , even a deranged gamer like this little bastard , if somebody else kills you , they get your points			0
they believe that 's why he killed himself			2
' @entity107 , 27 , ( left ) is shown in this undated handout photo was one of six adults killed at @entity5 along with principal @entity5 ( right ) @entity2 lead a line of children from the @entity5 in @entity5 on friday , dec. 14 , 2012 after @entity4 opened fire killing 20 1st graders tragedy : a woman waits to hear about her sister following the shooting at @entity5 in @entity5 , @entity91 in december @entity4 's killing spree lasted less than five minutes and during that time he fired 152 bullets into two classrooms in the @entity91 elementary school			1
@entity4 also had hundreds more rounds of ammunition on him and in the car that he drove to the school in			2
arriving at @entity5 at 9.35 a.m. , @entity4 , 20 , shot through the glass windows at the school entrance and immediately encountered principal @entity5 and school psychologist @entity130 , who had been alerted by the gunfire			1
he shot them both to death on sight			0
two teachers were also injured by ricocheting bullets from that initial burst of gunfire			0
one had been in the school 's meeting room with @entity142 and @entity130 and was wounded in the leg			0
the other was further down the hallway outside her classroom after rushing out on hearing the shots and was hit in the foot			0
police investigating the home of @entity4 in @entity91 have uncovered a dossier regarding every mass murder inside and outside of the @entity153 that he had compiled the member of staff who had been shot in the leg managed to crawl and call the police , which explains the rapid response time of law enforcement to the school			1
continuing down the corridor it was then that @entity4 apparently walked by the classroom of @entity5 , who had closed her classroom door on hearing the gunfire			1
the school had recently performed a practice lockdown drill and the black construction paper that had been put up on the door had been left there - leading @entity4 to think the classroom was empty			1
@entity172 and her class , sat in petrified silence while they heard @entity4 continue past their door			1
@entity4 then walked into the classroom of substitute teacher @entity5 to find her and the terrified children huddled together at the back of the room trying to hide in a bathroom			1
the deranged shooter killed @entity186 and all but one of her class			0
the little girl escaped by playing dead and emerged from the school with her clothes covered in blood saying , ' @entity194 , i 'm okay , but all my friends are dead			0
' before he set off on his killing spree - @entity4 shot his mother @entity197 in the face while she slept and then took the assault rifles she kept in a vault in their home @entity4 studied the 2006 mass shooting carried out by @entity27 ( left ) in which he killed five @entity29 school girls as well as the 2011 massacre of 77 people in @entity32 by @entity33 ( right ) a search and rescue team boat passes by covered bodies of victims from the summer school meeting organised by the ruling @entity212 on @entity213 , on july 23 , 2011 after @entity215 shooting spree she was the only survivor from a class of 16			1
when asked by her parents what she saw , the unnamed girl said she saw someone who was ' angry ' and ' very mad			0
' according to the unnamed source familiar with the report , @entity4 then walked back towards teacher @entity107 's class and upon entering encountered children cowering under their desks			1
he fatally shot these students along with @entity228 and then dramatically his assault rifle jammed - allowing six children from the class to escape out of the classroom while he reloaded			2
unknown to @entity233 , @entity228 had placed five children in a closet before he entered and opened fire and they were found unharmed after authorities arrived			2
authorities have also dispelled the theory that @entity4 was shooting at police as they arrived			2
despite bullets being fired out of the school as police rushed up the drive to the school , investigators now believe that @entity4 was firing at a teacher who was standing by a window			2
realizing that police were closing in , @entity4 then turned one of the two pistols he was carrying on himself less than five minutes after he began his killing spree and just as police were entering the building			2
