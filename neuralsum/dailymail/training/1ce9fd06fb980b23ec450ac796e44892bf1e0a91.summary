it is commonly thought that age brings wisdom			1
and this is largely true , it seems – unless you are @entity6			2
in which case , by the time you are 25 , you are likely to be just as wise as your elders , an astonishing new study reveals			0
@entity11 , however , are more conventional and develop deep understanding over time , according to research by the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			2
@entity17 heads on all shoulders : @entity6 have similar levels of measured wisdom at ages 25 and 75 - whereas @entity11 get wiser as they age , a study shows in one of the tests , designed to measure five crucial aspects of reasoning , @entity11 citizens ’ scores improved by 22 per cent over 50 years			1
but , in the examination scored out of 100 , both 25 - year - old and 75 - year - old @entity6 participants had an average quotient of 51 for intergroup wisdom – the idea of understanding society			1
with @entity11 , on the other hand , results from the same tests varied between averages of 45 and 55 between the two age groups			1
also , interpersonal wisdom – the understanding of relationships between individuals – the scores of the 225 @entity11 participants climbed from 46 to 50			1
in the case of the 186 @entity6 people recruited by lead researcher @entity51 , their scores actually dropped slightly from 53 to 52			0
the tests also recorded other unexpected results			0
given the @entity11 reputation of an individualistic society , you might expect its participants ’ interpersonal wisdom to be higher than their supposedly more collectivist @entity6 counterparts			1
yet the study showed that by 75 , the @entity6 scored higher in the interpersonal wisdom and @entity11 , in fact , achieved higher results in the intergroup variety			1
conventional wisdom : @entity11 tend to get steadily wiser as they get older dr @entity66 suggested that perhaps , then , you need individual skills when society is collective , and social ones when it is individualistic			2
his study , published in @entity73 and reported in @entity74 , recruited @entity6 and @entity11 with a range of different occupations			1
assessors scored their responses on the degree to which they discussed what psychologists consider five crucial aspects of wise reasoning			0
they are ‘ willingness to seek opportunities to resolve conflict , willingness to search for compromise , recognition of the limits of personal knowledge , awareness that more than one perspective on a problem can exist and appreciation of the fact that things may get worse before they get better ’			0
participants were asked to read a series of pretend newspaper articles			0
half – designed to test intergroup wisdom - described conflict between groups , such as a debate between residents of an impoverished @entity107 island over whether to allow foreign oil companies to operate there following the discovery of petroleum			2
the other half – used to measure out their interpersonal wisdom - took the form of advice columns that dealt with conflicts between individuals , including siblings , friends and spouses			0
after reading each article , participants were asked ‘ what do you think will happen after that ? ’ and ‘ why do you think it will happen this way ? ’ their responses were recorded and transcribed			0
then , to ensure that assessors could n’t know whose record came from which respondent , age - related information and clues to participants ’ nationalities were removed from the texts .			0

*scientists* scored different age groups out of 100 in tests designed to measure five aspects of wisdom
found @entity6 got same results at ages 25 and 75 but @entity11 *increased* their quotient by 22 *%*
