a father slit the throat of his three teenage daughters in an ‘ honour killing ’ after they were raped by @entity4 during the siege of the port city of @entity7			0
allegations of the shocking executions are contained in a report by the respected @entity12 group into war crimes and atrocities in the embattled city , which faced two months of being cut off from the rest of @entity17			1
the father is said to have carried out the ‘ honour killings ’ because of his humiliation and shame at the rape of the sisters – aged 15 , 17 and 18 – in @entity24 , on the outskirts of @entity7			1
the victims were not named			0
shattered : human rights investigators interviewed survivors of the siege of @entity7 and revealed widespread war crimes by @entity32 's men the horrific story was one of a number to emerge from @entity7 after the group sent in a team of interviewers in june to catalogue human rights abuses just after @entity41 forces expelled @entity32 loyalists			1
researchers from @entity12 were also told that @entity32 's men : the human rights group , which is based in @entity46 , concluded that there was widespread evidence of war crimes during the siege			1
hundreds of civilians died in the siege : here seven members of the @entity55 family - including @entity56 , eight , and @entity57 , five - are buried after their house was bombed by @entity32 's troops ' four eyewitnesses reported that ( @entity32 ) troops forcibly detained 107 civilians and used them as human shields to guard military munitions from @entity66 attacks south of @entity7 , ' said the report , which was released today			1
' one father told @entity12 how ( @entity32 ) soldiers forced his two young children to sit on a military tank and threatened the family : " you 'll stay here , and if @entity66 attacks us , you 'll die , too			1
" ' @entity74 , who was the lead author on the report , concluded that no one had evidence that rape was widespread - but the fear of sexual assault was endemic			2
' one witness reported that ( @entity32 ) forces transformed an elementary school into a detention site where they reportedly raped women and girls as young as 14 years old , ' the report noted			2
distress : @entity88 claimed she had been raped by @entity32 's men when she rushed into the @entity90 in @entity91 it added that it had found no evidence to confirm or deny reports that @entity32 troops and loyalists were issued @entity98 - type drugs to sustain their systematic rapes			0
researchers also heard reports of suspected honour killings - including the murder of the three sisters by their father			0
but @entity12 also noted that ' some in @entity24 have stood up against this practice , including a well - known sheik who has publicly advocated for raped women and girls to be seen as brave and bringing honor to their families '			0
the group obtained copies of military orders as evidence that @entity32 ordered his troops to starve civilians in @entity7 , while pillaging food caches and barring locals from receiving humanitarian aid			2
@entity12 only investigated the abuses committed by @entity32 forces			0
the timing of their visit , and its focus on @entity7 , meant that @entity12 was not in a position to comment on allegations of rights violations by the @entity41 rebels or by @entity66 , the group said			1
it said @entity66 should investigate any credible claims made against the allied force that supported the rebels , largely through thousands of bombing sorties			2
@entity12 particularly raised the issue of medical neutrality in war time , accusing the @entity32 forces of attacking hospitals , clinics and ambulances , and preventing doctors from reaching or treating injured civilians			1
last week , the @entity142 - based @entity141 said it had collected evidence that ' strongly suggests that @entity32 government forces went on a spate of arbitrary killing as @entity91 was falling			0
' meanwhile , @entity147 , which is based in @entity148 , also accused @entity150 guards of raping child detainees , but added that @entity41 rebels are abusing children and holding migrant workers as prisoners			0
all three major human rights groups have called on both sides to respect prisoners - and beyond that , to build a @entity17			1
' individual perpetrators need to be brought to justice and held to account for their crimes , ' @entity74 said			0
' and as we 've seen historically in places like @entity166 and @entity167 and @entity168 , it 's a cathartic experience for the country , and a necessary one , to move forward			0

human rights group uncovers widespread war crimes by loyalist forces
investigators told children perched on top of tanks as human shields
soldiers ' set up rape camp at school where dead sisters were attacked '
forced numerous civilians to act as human shields
perched children on top of tanks to deter @entity66 attacks
used rape as a *weapon* of war with *deadly* consequences
