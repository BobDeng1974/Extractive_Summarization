while we 're still yet to find concrete evidence it exists , scientists now think there might be half as much dark matter in the @entity5 as previously thought			1
by observing stars at the edge of the galaxy , astronomers claim we may have overestimated how much we should expect to find			0
and the discovery could also help explain another mystery of our galaxy - namely why it has so few other galaxies in orbit around it			2
astronomers at the @entity16 studied our @entity5 ( illustration shown )			1
they found the mass of dark matter should be 800 billion suns			1
this is half what the previous estimate for dark matter in the galaxy was			1
the discovery helps solve a mystery as to why we had so few satellite galaxies @entity30 astronomers used a method developed almost 100 years ago to discover that the weight of dark matter in our own galaxy is 800 billion times the mass of the sun - half what was previously thought			1
they probed the edge of the @entity5 , looking closely at the fringes of the galaxy about three trillion miles ( 5 trillion kilometres ) from @entity42			2
dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			1
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
the @entity55 says : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			0
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			0
' similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly			1
' scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			0
to make the discovery , they used a robust technique developed by @entity77 astronomer @entity76 in 1915 - decades before the discovery of dark matter			1
it involves measuring the speed of stars moving through the galaxy			0
astrophysicist dr @entity85 , from the @entity16 node of the @entity87 , said we have known for a while that most of the @entity90 is hidden			0
' stars , dust , you and me , all the things that we see , only make up about 4 per cent of the entire universe , ' he said			0
' about 25 per cent is dark matter and the rest is dark energy			2
' dr @entity85 , who is originally from @entity101 , was able to measure the mass of the dark matter in the @entity5 by studying the speed of stars throughout the galaxy , including the edges , which had never been studied to this detail before			1
earlier this year , in separate research scientists created the most detailed computer simulation of the history of the universe called @entity111 , revealing dark matter density in the universe ( illustrated here )			2
the simulation was developed by a team led by astrophysicist @entity117 of @entity118 dr @entity85 's measurement also helps to solve a mystery that has been haunting theorists for almost two decades			2
' the current idea of galaxy formation and evolution , called the @entity126 theory , predicts that there should be a handful of big satellite galaxies around the @entity5 that are visible with the naked eye , but we do n't see that , ' dr @entity85 said			1
' when you use our measurement of the mass of the dark matter the theory predicts that there should only be three satellite galaxies out there , which is exactly what we see ; the @entity140 , the @entity141 and the @entity142			1
' @entity144 astrophysicist professor @entity143 , who was also involved in the research , said the missing satellite problem had been ' a thorn in the cosmological side for almost 15 years			0
' ' dr @entity85 's work has shown that it might not be as bad as everyone thought , although there are still problems to overcome , ' he said			0
the study also presented a broader model of the @entity5 , which allowed the scientists to measure several interesting things such as the speed required to leave the galaxy			0
' be prepared to hit 3640 miles [ 550km ] per second if you want to escape the gravitational clutches of our galaxy , ' dr @entity85 said .			0

new figure predicts we should have three orbiting galaxies , which we do
