these dramatic images show the moment an @entity2 pulled out of a road and deliberately crashed into the side of a bus as part of a £ 1million ' crash for cash ' scam			1
the elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being driven into the side of @entity15 buses so passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives complicit in the scam - could falsely claim from insurers			1
the crashes took place between october 2010 and january 2012 and earned ringleader @entity21 45 , from @entity22 , @entity23 , £ 159,000			1
as the pictures show , all the collisions followed similar scenarios in which a car would collide with the side of a bus , causing both minimal impact and damage			0
in each case , the driver of the car would admit full liability , allowing all of the passengers from the bus to submit personal injury claims			1
he then personally processed 218 personal injury claims - which totalled more than £ 1million - to no win no fee lawyers			1
all of the bogus claims submitted by the @entity21 's company were for whiplash and ' soft tissue injuries , ' meaning they could not be verified by the insurance companies			1
instead , insurers were forced to rely on the individual claimants and usually settled out of court			0
@entity21 ( right ) , 45 , from @entity22 , @entity23 is facing jail after stage - managing several collisions in a £ 1m ' crash for cash ' fraud ; @entity72 ( left ) was found guilty of of conspiracy to commit fraud police uncovered @entity21 's plot after being alerted by @entity78 insurance to the unusually high volume of claims			1
they also found more than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another			2
the majority were friends or relatives of the 12 defendants , the court was told			2
the court heard how @entity21 had introduced 177 new claimants to a lawyer for which he received £ 960 each time			2
investigators later found that the bogus claims accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total gross income at @entity48 during the period			2
@entity21 was convicted yesterday at @entity98 of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud , following a 41 - day trial			1
nine other defendants , who police said played a major role in organising the collisions , were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud			1
four more people had already pleaded guilty to the charge , while two defendants were found not guilty			0
police believe more arrests will still be made over the scam			0
during the trial , the court was told how @entity21 masterminded the scam by finding drivers who were willing to carry out a fake crash			1
more than 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions were linked to one another and were mainly said to be friends and relatives of the 12 defendants			1
pictured : @entity124 ( left ) and @entity125 ( right ) were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud following the 41 - day trial at @entity129 the drivers would then pull out at low speed , using vehicles provided by @entity21 , and collide with the buses			1
the single and double decker buses had been chosen out of ' greed ' because of the sheer number of claims that could be lodged , the court was told			2
bus driver @entity140 told the court how he was caught up in one of the accidents while driving a park and ride bus towards @entity39 in june 2011			2
he told how he broke gently when he saw the @entity146 car pulling out of the side road , in a bid to prevent his standing passengers from being flung along the aisle			0
he added : ' i could n't brake harshly because i had standing passengers , if i 'd have done that they would have gone forward , so i had to go gently			0
the driver of the car said it was his fault , that his foot slipped off the brake on to the accelerator			0
' but he said one woman quickly reported that she ' was n't feeling well '			0
he was also approached by three men , one of whom claimed he had hurt his leg on the bus steps , despite having no visible sign of injury			0
nine other defendants , who police said played a major role in organising the collisions , were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud including @entity173 , 42 , ( left ) and @entity125 , 35 ( right ) when an ambulance was called to the scene , treatment was declined , he added			1
a passenger who was on the bus with his wife also told how he saw the @entity146 driver , at a side junction , actually looking at the bus just before to the collision			0
although there was a ' minimal jolt ' , a fellow passenger was overheard exclaiming ' oh my back ' , he said			0
@entity21 was also accused of making a false representation by not declaring two outstanding county court judgments when applying for a licence to operate his claims management business			2
after the case detective inspector @entity195 from @entity196 said the force would continue to investigate the case			0
he said : ' this was an extremely complex investigation spanning nearly three years and involving a large number of defendants			0
' it has been a challenging process for all officers involved and has required considerable professional skills in relation to the investigation and the subsequent prosecution			0
' as part of our investigation conducted a significant number of interviews , to gather the required evidence to prove that @entity21 and his associates had stage these collisions for the sole purpose of financial gain			2
' the crime that they committed was not a victimless crime , had all of the false claims created by @entity21 and his associates been successful we believe that the total cost would have been over £ 1 million , which would have been paid for by law abiding citizens through their car insurance policies			2
' det con @entity231 added : ' the police have a duty to protect life , and although these collisions were all minor , they could have been much more serious			0
' yet despite the fact all of the collisions were minor , with minimal damage to both vehicles , they all resulted in multiple claims for personal injury claims , with the vast majority of these claims submitted via @entity245 company			1
the trial at @entity129 ( pictured ) heard how the elaborate fraud involved cars and vans being deliberately driven into the side of buses so ' injured ' passengers - who were mainly friends and relatives in on the scam - could falsely claim from insurers ' through our investigations and the evidence we have gathered , we have been able to identify a " @entity259 " which shows that a large proportion of the claimants can be linked to each other			1
this network proves that over 90 per cent of the claimants involved in the collisions are linked to each other			0
' although the trial against these defendants has now concluded , we will continue to investigate this case and further arrests are likely			0
' other defendants found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud were : @entity274 , 28 , from @entity275 ; @entity276 , 27 , from @entity277 , @entity39 ; @entity173 , 42 , from @entity39 ; @entity72 , 40 , from @entity277 ; @entity278 , 45 , from @entity39 ; @entity279 , 43 , from @entity280 ; @entity124 , 48 , from @entity22 ; @entity281 , 57 , from @entity282 and @entity125 , 35 , from @entity22			1
@entity125 was found not guilty on one count of conspiracy			0
the following defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud before the trial : @entity290 @entity289 , 36 , of @entity291 ; @entity292 , 30 , of @entity293 ; @entity294 , 32 , of @entity295 and @entity296			1
@entity297 , 36 , from @entity22 and @entity298 , 22 , from @entity299 , were found not guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud .			1
