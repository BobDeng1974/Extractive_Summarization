in what could be considered the ultimate in wearable technology , a biohacker has inserted a computer under his skin			1
the biometric sensor is fitted into @entity13 - based @entity12 ’s forearm - between his skin and tissue - and tracks changes in his body ’s temperature			1
this sensor can connect wirelessly to any @entity18 device , produce readouts of the temperature changes and send @entity12 a text message if he ’s suffering from a fever , for example			1
it connects by @entity29 to an @entity18 tablet			2
the sensor tracks changes in his body 's temperature			2
if the temperature reaches a certain level , a text message is sent warning him of a fever to insert the device , an incision was made on @entity12 's forearm above an existing tattoo			1
his skin was lifted and separated away from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that is created before being sutured shut			1
the sensor can connect wirelessly over @entity29 to any @entity18 device , produce readouts of the temperature changes , and send @entity12 a text message if he ’s suffering from a fever , for example			1
@entity55 is protected inside a protective case and has a battery that can be charged wirelessly			2
@entity12 created the sensor , called @entity59 , using a @entity29 connector , computer chip , and fitted it with led lights			1
these leds act as ‘ status lights ’ that can be used to light up a tattoo on @entity12 ’s arm , under which the sensor is fitted			0
the first version of the sensor reads temperature changes but , in theory , later versions could be used to track other vital signs and body changes			1
@entity55 is protected inside a protective case and has a battery that can be charged wirelessly			0
‘ the human body is really failing in almost every way , ’ @entity12 told @entity77 , vice ’s science and technology channel			0
‘ i want to live to be thousands of years old , i do n't want to die and i do n't know why anybody would			0
‘ [ the idea behind the sensor ] is very fun			0
it 's meant to capture people 's imagination			0
' @entity12 created the sensor , called @entity59 , pictured , using a @entity29 connector , computer chip , and fitted it with led lights			1
the sensor is set to go on sale ' soon ' for around $ 500 ( £ 313 ) and is open source , meaning the data can be collected and used in whichever way the owner wants @entity12 is a biohacker working for a company called @entity99 that builds devices designed to integrate with the human body			1
@entity12 added : ‘ we basically focus on the merging of man and machine			0
’ to insert the device , an incision was made on @entity12 's forearm above an existing tattoo			0
his skin was lifted and separated away from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that was created before being sutured shut			2
it was inserted by a so - called @entity115 called @entity116 at the @entity117 in @entity13			0
to insert the device , pictured , an incision was made on @entity12 's forearm above an existing tattoo			0
his skin was lifted and separated away from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that was created , before being sutured shut			2
leds fitted to the sensor act as ' status lights ' to show the device is working @entity12 told @entity77 that no doctor would carry out the procedure , and @entity116 did not use any anaesthetic			2
before the procedure , @entity116 told @entity77 : ' when we put this in it will make history			0
' the @entity59 is set to go on sale ‘ soon ’ for around $ 500 ( £ 313 ) and is open source , meaning that the data can be collected and used in whichever way the owner wants			1
this does not include fitting , which @entity116 said he would charge around $ 200 ( £ 125 ) .			0

@entity140 inserted the chip to track changes in his temperature
he fitted the @entity55 biometric sensor under the skin of his forearm
the sensor links with an @entity18 device and can even send text messages
would - be hackers will soon be able to *buy* the sensor for $ 500 ( £ 313 )
