by @entity0 published : 02:06 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 03:39 est , 8 july 2013 public health officials said trout from the @entity3 should not be eaten amid fears a pesticide has leached into the water public health officials are warning people to avoid contact with water from one of @entity13 's most famous fishing rivers over fears it has been contaminated by a pesticide			1
the @entity17 says it is investigating a ' serious pollution ' incident on the @entity3 and said people should not allow the water to touch their skin or eat trout caught from the river			1
there are fears a pesticide has leached into the water between @entity29 and @entity30 on the @entity33 - @entity32 border			1
tests on the water revealed that invertebrates have disappeared , sparking fears for wildlife further up the food chain			1
the @entity3 is world - famous in angling circles for the purity of its water and the fatness of its trout , and there are syndicates along the river near @entity30 where ' rods ' pay up to Â£ 3,000 a season for their sport			1
pupils at @entity54 , where the @entity55 was taught , are offered trout - fishing lessons on the stretch of @entity3 which flows through the grounds			1
campaigners from the action for the @entity3 group say they first became alarmed last month by the increasingly murky state of the water			2
@entity65 director @entity64 said : ' the water had been a funny colour for a long time , caused by an algal bloom , and we were watching it carefully as it was a cause for concern			0
' then suddenly on sunday , the water went clear			0
at first we were very pleased but then we tested the water and found that all the invertebrates - the bugs that the fish and birds eat - had disappeared			2
' she said the issue is on a 10 - mile stretch of the river downstream from a sewage treatment works			1
ms @entity64 said : ' those little bugs at the bottom of the river are so important			0
it would be like killing all the grass in a field so the cows had nothing to eat			0
' at the moment we do n't know where this pollution has come from			0
' a spokesman for the @entity17 , which launched an investigation on tuesday , said : ' the pollution has now stopped and we are investigating the cause and the source of the pollutant			2
' environment officers have taken soil samples and ecology samples to help us identify the source			0
' @entity17 said there was a ' serious pollution ' incident on the river between @entity107 and @entity30 the @entity17 said officers have been investigating the source of the pollution , believed to be chlorpyrifos , a common agricultural pesticide , and have been taking samples to assess the impact on the water quality			1
' investigations have shown that many macro-invertebrates have been killed , but there have been no reports so far of any fish killed , ' the agency said in a statement yesterday			0
@entity124 , working in partnership with the @entity17 and @entity33 and @entity123 , has advised the public to avoid skin contact with the water in the river until the exact concentrations and impacts of the pesticide have been determined			1
people are also being advised not to fish or to eat any fish caught in the affected stretch of the river until there is more information about exactly what has caused the pollution			2
@entity140 mp , the @entity141 's campaigns coordinator , said : ' we want to know why on earth a lethal chemical like chlorpyriphos is allowed to be used anywhere near a river or watercourse			0
' apparently the 15km wipe out of invertebrates between @entity29 and @entity30 may have been caused by as little as a couple of spoonfuls of the stuff			0
if this is the case then the sooner we follow the lead of @entity156 and @entity157 and ban it the better			0
