' the director said the wealth of positive public feeling towards the clipper was overwhelming when residents were given a free tour of the vessel at the weekend - ' people have invested love in this ship to put it back together again ' , he said			0
the clipper is now displayed in a stunning setting , lifted more than 11ft ( 3.4m ) above its dry berth in @entity120 , south east @entity8 , and is once again a major landmark passed by runners who took part in sunday 's marathon			0
the space under the three - masted vessel is home to an interactive museum where visitors can learn about its history			0
when the fire , caused by a vacuum cleaner that had been left on , struck in 2007 most of the fixtures and fittings had been removed for a major project to renovate the vessel , now 143 - years - old , so visitors can see many original features on deck			1
the royal couple later moved inside to view the @entity121 's cramped decks that during its working life were filled with tea from @entity206 , and when this cargo was no longer an option , it carried hessian from @entity210 to @entity211 and castor oil from @entity213 to @entity214			1

but she came into her own as a wool clipper sailing the trade route around @entity231 's @entity230 and through the @entity233 trade winds , setting in 1885 a record passage time of 73 days from @entity235 to @entity8			0
displays on the decks tell the history of the vessel from its construction to how tea is made in @entity206 , and @entity147 had to bow his head at several points to avoid metal girders			0

the volunteers had braved the cold , wet and windy conditions for the previous two hours and were given a wave by the @entity1 and @entity0 before they attended a reception in the new space below the ship 's hull			0
as they walked into the hall , suspended above the royals was the vessel covered in the gold - coloured muntz metal , a copper and zinc alloy , it would originally have been covered in			0
the royal couple were introduced to many organisations behind the restoration project and in a brief speech @entity45 , chairman of the @entity138 , praised @entity147 saying the clipper ' would not be here today ' without his campaigning to preserve it			0
before leaving for the @entity276 , the @entity0 unveiled a plaque to officially open the attraction which will admit the public for the first time tomorrow			0

he came to @entity120 soon after the fire to assess the damage for himself and mr @entity137 said that the @entity1 had given up his association with a number of bodies when he turned 90 last year but maintained his relationship with the society , now a trust			1
