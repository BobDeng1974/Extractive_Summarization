by @entity0 the assassination of president @entity2 in @entity3 50 years ago changed the way the media worked for decades to come			0
on november 22 , 1963 , a transformative live , global tv news event took place and the idea was born of broadcasting live from the scene , having an anchor for the coverage and letting the images do the talking			1
it swept an industry without a playbook for covering a breaking story of such magnitude and utterly changed how people receive their news			2
other live tv news events followed , and the next time networks devoted as much time to commercial - free news broadcasts came with the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity30			1

mourning and a sense of loss were visceral , with a survey at the time saying about two - thirds of @entity30 watching the events fell ill or felt emotional distress			1
newspapers and radio were the main sources of news the day before the assassination , but the pendulum had swung			2
' this is when @entity30 became a tv nation , ' said @entity112 , a senior manager of exhibits at the @entity114 , a museum for the news industry in @entity33			1
in 1950 only 9 percent of @entity30 households had television			1

at the time of the assassination , @entity133 and @entity134 anchors broadcast from studios that slightly resembled living rooms			0

instant replay , a technology @entity48 planned to roll out a few weeks later for the @entity151 college football game , made its national debut when @entity3 nightclub owner @entity154 shot suspected assassin @entity155 dead in the basement of the @entity3 police building			0
@entity159 's first satellite tv broadcast carried news of the @entity2 assassination			2

after @entity203 shot @entity155 , the first murder broadcast nationally on @entity30 television , @entity3 police mostly ended the ' perp walk ' for cameras			2
@entity30 officials generally started to keep the media at a greater distance , with many other governments following suit			2
cynicism also grew in the public , with many asking if the official version of @entity155 acting alone were true			0
the @entity216 , race riots in @entity30 cities as well as the assassinations of @entity2 's brother and civil rights leader @entity220 further disillusioned many @entity30 in the 1960s			2
