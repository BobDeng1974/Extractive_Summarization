new dna evidence has cast doubt on the murder conviction of the retired teacher jailed for the ' @entity5 ' murder			1
in 2005 , @entity5 was found guilty of murdering his wife @entity6 with an ice axe and dumping her body in @entity9 in @entity10 30 years earlier			1
her badly beaten , weighted - down body was found at the bottom of the lake 21 years after her death in 1976 , and @entity5 's eventual conviction ended what had been one of @entity20 's most notorious unsolved cases			1
the family of @entity5 ( pictured left with third wife @entity22 in 2005 ) say new dna evidence has cast doubt over his murder conviction for killing first wife @entity6 ( right ) , who became known as the @entity26 @entity5 had always denied killing his 30 - year - old wife , and was found hanged in his cell at @entity29 , @entity30 , on january 25 , 2010 - the morning of his 66th birthday			1
now the case is again under scrutiny , and @entity5 's family have reportedly found new dna evidence that they say may clear his name and open the door for a new investigation into @entity40 's death			1
the evidence will be presented to independent watchdog the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , which reviews alleged miscarriages of justice and has confirmed it is ' actively investigating ' the case			1
it is understood that the @entity43 is due to visit @entity47 as part of the investigation , although it has not commented on this			2
denial : @entity5 had always denied killing his 30 - year - old wife , pictured with him on their wedding day in 1967 accused : @entity5 , pictured with @entity6 on her 21st birthday in 1966 , was accused of bludgeoning her to death with an ice axe , and dumping her body in @entity9 the retired schoolmaster was accused of bludgeoning mrs park to death with an ice axe in july 1976 and dumping her body in the lake near the family home in @entity65 , near @entity66			1
he claimed he had taken their children on a trip to @entity71 on the day she vanished , and that she had gone to live with another man			0
her body had come to rest on an underwater ledge and was found by amateur divers 21 years later			2
the case became known as ‘ @entity5 ’ after the @entity78 novel of the same name			2
mrs @entity40 was found wearing her blue baby doll night - dress , arms bound tightly and with tape over her eyes			2
probe : police investigate boats at @entity9 after the discovery of @entity89 's body in 1997 weighed down : mrs @entity40 's decomposed body was found with these lead weights and ropes dress : she was found wearing her blue baby doll night - dress , arms bound tightly and with tape over her eyes scene : legal teams from the 2005 trial are shown the spot on @entity9 where @entity89 's body was recovered after the grim discovery , @entity5 was arrested and charged with her murder but the case against him was dropped in january 1998 when the @entity108 said it did not have enough evidence against him			1
a second police investigation uncovered fresh evidence by linking him to the killing with the knots meticulously used to tie up the body and a piece of @entity117 green slate used to weigh it down , which matched the stone used to build the family home			1
in 2005 , @entity5 was found guilty of murder at @entity123 and jailed for life as he was told he would serve a minimum of 15 years			2
suicide : @entity5 was found hanged in his cell at @entity29 , @entity30 , on january 25 , 2010 - the morning of his 66th birthday however , he had always maintained his innocence and wrote letters to the media from jail			1
his family , including third wife @entity22 and his children @entity139 and @entity140 have continued campaigned for his conviction to be overturned posthumously			1
@entity142 , who is leading the campaign to clear his father 's name , said the dna evidence had been uncovered by the family 's lawyers , but has not given further details			1
' this test may shed some serious new light on this whole thing , ' he told @entity154 's @entity153			2
' this will all come out very soon			0
' it is also believed that the watchdog may be re-examining evidence from a woman who said she saw @entity5 push something into @entity9 in 1976 , coming forward to give her account in 2004			1
@entity163 's testimony was challenged during the trial , when it was argued that she was too far away to identify the person in the boat , and that it could n't have been mrs @entity40 's body that was being dumped as mrs @entity163 was positioned in a way that the place where the body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island			0
mrs @entity40 's nieces , @entity174 , 50 , and @entity175 , 45 , both from @entity66 , who now live in @entity177 , say they both think the correct verdict was given at the time			0
@entity5 's family launched a fresh bid to clear his name in 2010 - nine months after he was found dead in his prison cell on his 66th birthday			1
in 2013 an inquest jury in @entity177 ruled that @entity5 , of @entity66 , had killed himself			2
for the last four years , the @entity43 has been examining evidence and police files to see if the case should go before the @entity190			1
the @entity43 investigates miscarriages of justice in the @entity20 and rarely considers cases when the person has died			0
such a probe can take up to six years to fully investigate , in some cases			0
many claimed that much of the evidence against @entity5 could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free @entity5 from prison and to clear his name			1
husband : @entity5 is pictured at @entity204 after charges brought against him in 1997 were dropped the following year by the @entity108 due to a lack of evidence son : @entity142 ( pictured at the family home in 1997 ) , who is leading the campaign to clear his father 's name , said the dna evidence had been uncovered by the family 's lawyers the case featured prominently in the book , no smoke - @entity219 , which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder			1
a spokesman for the watchdog refused to confirm or deny a site visit , only saying : ' the @entity43 is actively investigating this case			1
' mrs @entity174 , the daughter of @entity230 's now deceased brother , @entity229 said : ' @entity232 family will not accept the evidence that was put to the courts to help convict @entity5			1
' i really think they are clutching at straws and hoping to find an answer that is n't there			0
myself and @entity175 still feel the correct verdict was given			0
' @entity5 went to the @entity241 and lost , so what makes them think after all this time they could find any information that could overturn the court 's decision ? and we will carry on fighting for justice			0
' murdered : school teacher @entity230 , pictured in 1963 , vanished from her home in @entity65 , near @entity66 , @entity10 during the drought - hit summer of 1976 school teacher @entity230 vanished from her home in @entity65 , near @entity66 , @entity10 during the drought - hit summer of 1976			2
she was 30 and suspicion immediately fell on her husband - with whom she had an ' open ' marriage			0
mrs @entity40 's body remained missing until august 1997 , when it was discovered , weighted down , by two amateur divers on an underwater ledge in @entity9			1
police nicknamed her the @entity5 after the @entity78 crime novel of the same name			0
father - of - three @entity5 was arrested and charged with murder but the charges were dropped in january 1998 due to lack of evidence			1
however , he was re-arrested in 2004 and , at the end of a two - month trial at @entity123 , the jury found him guilty of murder			0
the trial became notorious as the courtroom heard the couple had had a tempestuous relationship			0
they were involved in wife - swapping parties and mrs @entity40 had embarked on affairs with several men			0
in december 1974 , mrs @entity40 moved to @entity279 to live with policeman @entity280 , whom she had met at an @entity282 summer school			0
she planned to marry him , but after failing to win custody of the couple 's three children in 1975 , she reluctantly returned to the marital home			0
meanwhile , @entity5 had relationships with at least two women before agreeing to give his marriage a second chance			0
however , the arguments and accusations of infidelity continued and it was against this background that @entity5 was found to have murdered his wife			1
the court case was told that he had smashed her in the face with a climber 's ice - axe , and kept her body in the freezer until deciding to dispose of it			2
her skeletal remains were dressed in a faded blue baby - doll nightdress when they were found in the lake			0

however , he did not report her missing for six weeks			0
@entity5 , said to be a control freak , was said to have become frustrated and jealous , and was unable to control his wife			2
police believe mrs @entity40 was preparing to press for a divorce but was determined to keep the family bungalow and custody of the children , and it may have been this that sparked @entity5 's anger			2
while in prison on remand in october 1997 , he admitted the killing , telling fellow inmates ' she deserved it ' after he discovered her in bed with another man			0
family members , however , never stopped believing in his innocence and campaigned for a retrial			0
his children @entity139 , @entity343 and @entity344 , and third wife @entity22 , have campaigned tirelessly to prove his innocence since he was jailed .			0
