@entity5 , skipper of @entity6 , found the edible crab while fishing near @entity8 in @entity9 and noticed the crustacean had three pincers on its right claw			1
he has since donated it to the resort ’s @entity14 where experts admit they do n't know how or why the 7 - inch crab developed the extra hook			1
a curious crab has been discovered off the coast of the @entity3 that has mysteriously grown an extra pincer , pictured , making it resemble @entity22 character @entity21			1
the edible crab was found by a fisherman near @entity8 in @entity9 the edible crab , also known as the brown crab , is the largest species commonly found around the @entity28			1
it has characteristic large black tipped claws and a ‘ pie - crust ’ edge to the shell which makes it easily identifiable			2
males can weigh up to three kilograms			0
the crabs are generally nocturnal , scavenging and foraging for food under the cover of darkness and adults are found as deep as 100m under water			0
tests have shown that edible crabs ’ claws have the crushing strength of over 90lb per square inch - an average person ’s hand is only capable of squashing 25lb per square inch			0
if a crab loses a claw , they can re-grow it during a number of molts , which is when a crab sheds its exoskeleton for a new one , but it can grow back smaller or weaker than the original			1
@entity57 from the aquarium said : ' it ’s relatively unusual to come across crustaceans with extra claws			2
' no - one really knows why this sometimes happens , it could be due to environmental factors or be a genetic mutation			0
' crabs , like other crustaceans , are capable of re-growing limbs and claws if they lose or damage them in a fight			0
' perhaps this particular crab ’s ability to re-generate lost limbs has got confused and , rather than replacing a missing set of claws , it ’s actually ended up growing an extra pair instead			1

edible crabs also use their claws for fighting with other crabs , which often results in one or the other losing them			0
the crab has since been donated it to the resort @entity109 where experts admit they do n't know how or why the 7 - inch crab developed the extra hook if a crab loses a claw , they can regrow it during a number of molts , which is when a crab sheds its exoskeleton for a new one , but it can grow back smaller or weaker than the original			1
a molt can last from between four and eight weeks , making the crab vulnerable to threats during this time			2
@entity57 added : ' although the extra claws look impressive they ca n’t actually function so he ’s no more dangerous to handle than any other crab			2

the mutant crustacean was discovered by a fisherman in @entity8
it is *unclear* how or why the brown crab developed its extra pincer
the crab *'s* claw resembles the hands of @entity22 character @entity21
