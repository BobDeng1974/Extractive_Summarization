@entity0 has rejected claims @entity2 was about to be withdrawn just seconds before he scored the goal that saved @entity4 against @entity5 in @entity6			1
the visiting bench were debating substitutions as the 73rd - minute free kick was being prepared , and @entity2 ’s @entity10 appeared briefly on the fourth official ’s board before the @entity4 captain stepped up to score the winning goal			1
@entity15 was preparing to come on and the @entity4 manager claimed later that it was a straight choice between @entity2 and @entity18 , both of whom had missed chances , and that the final decision had not been made			1
scroll down to read transcript of @entity0 's post-match interview with @entity25 @entity15 prepares to come on for @entity4 as @entity0 seeks to break the deadlock but just as the @entity28 is about to come on , @entity2 scores a free - kick , and @entity15 is sent back shortly after the goal , @entity18 rolled his ankle and was replaced by @entity15 on 80 minutes before heading into the dressing room for treatment			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we wanted to get @entity15 on because he ’s a goalscorer and we had n’t been taking our goal chances so when you have someone like @entity15 , who you know has a goal in him , we wanted him on the field			1
‘ so it was really was a question of which one we take off , as they had both missed their chances			0
neither of the strikers could have been too critical of me if i had chosen him			0
' we were umming and aahing about which of the two front players to take off and when @entity18 turned his ankle , there was of course no question			1
' when being interviewed by @entity25 , @entity0 was then told that their touchline reporters had seen the paperwork indicating that @entity2 ’s number , no 10 , was the player to come off but the manager claimed he had no knowledge of that			1
‘ we were still considering it , as far as i know , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ to be fair , as i was in discussion , i do n't know about forms going in so no doubt you 're going to produce some evidence but certainly it was n't my intention			0
’ @entity15 grins as he walks back to his seat , the 32 - year - old appears to see the funny side of the situation the former @entity74 man has three goals in 10 appearances for @entity4 , but will have to wait for more @entity2 , who moved to one behind @entity78 on the @entity4 all - time scorers list with his 43rd goal for his country , looked surprised when told that he was about to come off before the free - kick			1
‘ that 's football , ’ he said			0
‘ i think i 've shown over the years i 'm always capable of scoring goals			0
’ @entity2 might have had a hat - trick , missing excellent chances on 18 minutes and just before full - time when clean through on goal but said : ‘ we knew before the game , having obviously faced teams like this before , that they 're tough games			1
' it 's difficult to break them down , and tonight it was			0
thankfully , we got the goal and saw them out			2
it was a tough game and a good win			2
it was close but i was just focussing on trying to get it up and over the wall as quick as i could			0
’ @entity2 's fortuitous goal was initially saved by the keeper but it then rebounded off the post and in @entity4 's captain celebrates with @entity108 after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal @entity0 claimed the missed chances meant that @entity2 would be content with his overall performance			1
‘ @entity2 is very self - critical , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he is delighted of course , to score the winning goal but he knows he and his fellow forwards could have had so many more			2
' we knew it would n’t be a piece of cake to come here and win the game			2
i perhaps did n’t expect us to dominate it as much as we did from the offset			0
it was harder than should have been because created so many opportunities in the first half particularly			0
’ @entity18 received treatment on sunday night on his ankle but there was more hopeful news for @entity131 , whose injury list at @entity133 is growing , when @entity0 said : ' i do n’t think he ’s injured			1
i think he just rolled it slightly but the doctors are not concerned about it all			0
' @entity0 looks contemplative in the middle of the pitch in @entity6 as @entity4 fans put up their flags behind him @entity25 : can you just explain , you might have got a break tonight , because you 'd put in ( a request ) for @entity2 to come off ? @entity145 : ' no no no. we were going to put @entity15 on and we were discussing which player to take off			1
' we had n't made up our mind if it was going to be @entity2 or , more likely , @entity18 and it had to be @entity18 in the end because unfortunately he turned his ankle slightly but it 's no danger because he 'll be fit ( for @entity133 )			1
' i think he 'd have been bitterly disappointed if he 'd come off the field without scoring a goal tonight and i think he 'd have blamed himself			2
luckily he does n't have to because he 's scored the winner and we go away with three more points			2
' @entity25 : so that form had n't gone in with @entity2 's name on it ? you were still considering it ? @entity145 : ' no no. we were still considering it			1
at least as far as i know			0
' i was in discussions with other members of my staff , i do n't know about forms going in			0
' no doubt you 're going to produce some evidence that a form had gone in in a minute but certainly it was n't my intention			0
' @entity171 : ' i think @entity2 looked like the only one who was going to score			2
we made that game far more difficult than it should have been			0
' we got away with it a little bit at 10 men			0
that 's what happens in football			0
you get away with it sometimes			0
' @entity183 : ' it was a bit surprising			0
if you 're going to bring @entity15 on you 'd of thought @entity18 who was quiet tonight , you could have taken him off			1
' he ( @entity2 ) was definitely surprised tonight when he got asked the question ( about being substituted )			2

@entity2 scored only goal of the game in the 73rd minute
@entity0 was preparing to substitute his captain before goal , claim @entity25
@entity28 striker @entity15 was about to come on for @entity2
@entity2 scored and @entity18 became injured , so the plan changed
