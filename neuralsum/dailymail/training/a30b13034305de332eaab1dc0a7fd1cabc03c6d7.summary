@entity8 had filed a suit in january 2014 against @entity2 , co-founded by ' @entity20 ' host @entity3 , alleging that the physical keyboard it makes for some of @entity25 's @entity6 devices infringed on the @entity28 smartphone maker 's design patents			1
other phone and tablet versions will then follow later next year although the keyboard slides onto the bottom of the phone , it actually connects to the software via @entity42			1

@entity17 argued that @entity8 has not shown that it has lost any sales as a result of @entity2 's conduct and that a fine would constitute an undeserved windfall for @entity8			1
the judge agreed it was unclear to what extent @entity8 had been damaged , but added that ' @entity2 's not so clever attempts to evade the court 's preliminary injunction ' were quite transparent			2
' the amount of sanctions awarded is only a third of what @entity8 sought and is directly tied to additional revenue that @entity17 could have expected from its illegal conduct , ' said judge @entity9 , in the order			1
@entity3 is said to have invested $ 1million in the phone keyboard , and he is shown as a co-founder on the @entity106 company website			1
