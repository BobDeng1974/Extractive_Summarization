from a ' health and safety ' tree decorated with hazard tape and a traffic cone fairy to one made entirely of rubbish bags , are these @entity6 's worst @entity5 trees ? the dodgy @entity5 trees , from towns and villages up and down the country , have been ridiculed as being the worst in the country for their poor decoration and non-traditional , and occasionally bizarre design			1
one town 's tree was so bad that it even had it 's own @entity19 page - @entity20 of @entity21 ! - set up by locals in the @entity24 village in protest over its spindly , sparse branches and lack of decorations			1
but at least theirs was actually a tree			0
in @entity35 , @entity33 - on - @entity34 , their town christmas tree was literally rubbish			1
plastic bags collected by local schoolchildren were stacked high to create the bizarre festive offering			2
in some areas , the trees were considered such a health and safety risk they were fenced off from the public			0
this health - and - safety - conscious tree in north @entity78 was decorated with bows made from hazard warning tape and plastic and instead of an angel on top , sits a plastic traffic cone ( pictured ) this unusual christmas tree in @entity86 , @entity87 , was described as a ' great big weed growing out of a stick ' locals in @entity91 , @entity24 , set up a @entity19 page in protest against their town tree - @entity20 of @entity21 ! - until they decide to decorate it themselves ( right ) while this conical tree ( left ) was dubbed one of the worst in the country when it appeared in @entity100 @entity99 last year and has now been donated to a local charity christmas trees in @entity103 , in the @entity104 , @entity100 in @entity105 and @entity106 in @entity107 were all surrounded by metal fences , leading to @entity110 residents branding their town 's festive feature an ' absolute joke ' and launching a campaign to jazz up their ' depressing ' tree			1
but when it came to red tape , it was hard to beat the health - and - safety - conscious tree in north @entity78			1
surrounded by plastic fencing , it was decorated with bows made from hazard warning tape and plastic			2
instead of an angel on top , sits a plastic traffic cone			0
other criticism came over trees being too bare and under decorated , non-traditional shapes and design and - in the case of one in @entity86 , @entity87 , the fact it allegedly looked like ' a great big weed growing out of a stick '			0
in @entity40 - on - @entity41 , @entity42 , the choice of decorations was described ' as something you 'd find after an explosion in a rag factory ' while in @entity50 , @entity51 , locals were left with a conical piece of white plastic with lights topped with a star and decorated with one solitary piece of tinsel and a few baubles			0
and a conical tree , dubbed one of the worst in the country when it was placed on @entity100 @entity99 last year , was so hated it has not returned but has been donated to a local charity			0
people complained trees had been fenced off from the public by a health and safety perimeter such as this conical festive offering in @entity103 @entity159 and @entity161 's administration commissioned two ' recycled ' trees , the first - made from old ring - binders ( left ) and the second - an old library shelf , filled with flotsam and jetsam found on the beach , including a rubber glove as a ' fairy ' ( right ) while residents in @entity110 , @entity107 , had their festive spirit dashed after seeing the underwhelming tree that has no lights and is surrounded by metal fencing on concrete blocks ( pictured ) finally , in @entity176 , @entity175 locals gathered round their bizarre ' star ' tree made of metal poles wrapped in tinsel			2

the trees across the country have been ridiculed for their poor decoration and non-traditional - even bizarre - design
they include a ' rubbish ' christmas tree made entirely from plastic bags collected by children in @entity192 , @entity33 - on - @entity34
and a health - and - safety - conscious tree in @entity78 was decorated with hazard tape and topped with a traffic cone
one tree was so bad locals set up its own @entity19 page - @entity20 of @entity21
