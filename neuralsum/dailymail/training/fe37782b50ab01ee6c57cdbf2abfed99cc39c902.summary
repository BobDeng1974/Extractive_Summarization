ms @entity15 , 33 , said : ' i was told i needed to pick @entity5 up as his haircut was n’t respectable , was offensive , and did n’t comply with school policy			1
' i do n’t see how they can deny him his education			0
it ’s taking it too far			0
' it is the second time the teenager has been in trouble over his hair			0
last year he was forced to study alone for a week when he modelled himself on @entity29			2
