the last time @entity1 lost this early at the @entity3 the world was a very different place			1
in january 2001 the dreadful events of 9/11 , for example , had yet to happen			2
there was no such thing as @entity10 or @entity11 , and the great @entity12 was still two - and - a - half years from winning his first @entity13			2
it is almost a whole career ago for @entity1 , who showed he is now much nearer the end than the beginning with his third - round exit at the hands of world no 46 @entity20			1
it is the first time since 2004 @entity1 has not made a @entity36 quarter - final			1
2013 — @entity37 loses in straight sets to @entity41 ’s @entity40 in round four			0
2014 - @entity43 @entity45 @entity44 wins in five sets in the fourth round			2
2015 — @entity3 @entity20 ’s third - round win ensures @entity1 ’s earliest @entity3 exit since 2001			1
@entity1 went down to a 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 defeat in which he seemed to feel all of his 33 years , producing an unexpectedly sluggish display against a player he had beaten 10 times out of 10 before friday			1
nobody would have thought he would be heading back to @entity55 before @entity56 , who came in so desperately out of form but is now safely into the fourth round			0
it is a tribute to @entity1 that @entity59 was in a state of shock after his loss to the uncelebrated @entity26 , and that the result should spark such debate			1
there is so much mileage on the clock , so little to prove for the now father of four , that it is extraordinary he arrived as one of the favourites following such a successful 2014			0
he had not even started this year badly , winning the @entity74 by beating , among others , @entity71 , whom he could have played again here in the quarter - finals were he to beat @entity76 in the fourth round			1
while @entity20 is no slouch — his winning forehand pass was a shot for the ages — @entity1 admitted he was at a loss about his display			1
he made vague references to having a poor feel for the ball in the two previous days , and when it had come to producing his best form at the most important time he had failed			0
@entity1 plays a forehand during his third round clash with @entity20 at @entity59 on friday @entity26 star @entity20 connects with a backhand on his way to victory against no 2 seed @entity1 of course , this is just one loss so far this season , but it completes his recent collection of unscheduled exits from @entity36			1
in 2013 he lost in the second and fourth rounds of @entity13 and the @entity37 respectively , while last may he tumbled out of @entity43 in the fourth round			0
@entity1 is now going to take a scheduled holiday , just a little earlier than expected			1
he always planned it this way because of an unusually truncated off - season and friday 's loss may have have been connected to its brevity			1
during his rebound season of 2014 he emphasised how important his break and training bloc had been to lay the foundations			0
this time he did not finish the official year until late november due to the @entity111 final , while in december he travelled to @entity112 to make a $ 4million appearance in the @entity114			2
given his charity efforts and corporate work in @entity12 , he would hardly have had time to catch his breath before heading to @entity119 for the start of this season			0
@entity1 stretches to make a forehand shot during a difficult afternoon in the @entity59 heat @entity20 executes a backhand during one of the most memorable victories of his career so far @entity1 pondered this at length afterwards			1
‘ it allowed me to stay in rhythm and plan to take a break after here , ’ he said			0
‘ i was playing great leading into the tournament so i do n’t want to say i peaked too soon			0
but then again , margins are small and these things happen			0
clearly i will have a look at it but i do n’t think i did anything wrong			0
’ he now has four weeks off before his next tournament , at his secondary home of @entity143 , and by then there will be another @entity3 champion			2
the feeling persists that by far his best chance of getting one more @entity36 is @entity13 this summer — and that would be three years after his last one			0
@entity56 , who suffered cramp during his nervy five - set win over @entity152 @entity151 on wednesday , was fully restored in asserting his superiority over @entity154 , the world no 106 , winning 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 5			1
the key thing for the @entity157 is to be able to play matches , as he has been unable to string together any kind of run since @entity13 last year			0
if his confidence fully returns then many stranger things have happened than him winning this title			0
@entity56 ’s next opponent will be @entity168 giant @entity166 , currently at a career - high ranking of 15			2
@entity1 will be watching from his holiday idyll somewhere , or trying to ignore it			2
@entity1 tries to cool off by changing his shirt but it could n't help him find his best form on friday @entity1 smiles as he gives @entity20 a hug following an almost three - hour battle on the @entity177			1

@entity20 beat @entity1 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 on friday in @entity59
no 2 seed @entity1 was ahead in the final *tiebreak* but then *faltered*
he has not gone out so early in the @entity3 since 2001
