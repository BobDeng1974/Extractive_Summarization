when emergency crews received a call saying ' someone ' had been knocked down by a car in @entity5 , they immediately sent two ambulances to the rescue			0
but the vehicles returned to base just moments later when the caller revealed the ' victim ' was actually a squirrel that had been run over in @entity12			1
the report forms just part of a long list released by @entity17 ambulance service detailing their most bizarre , and irritating , call outs			1
two ambulances were sent to @entity12 after a caller told crews ' someone ' had been run down , only for the ' victim ' to turn out to be a squirrel			2
another man said he had dropped his burger and it was ' bleeding ' another came from reveller in @entity29 , @entity5 , who said ' i 've dropped my burger and it is bleeding ' , while a third woman in @entity34 , dialled 999 to report ' i 've eaten too much takeaway food			1
' the service said it receives around 2,500 calls per day , and in the last two years has had to deal with 1,248 that did not need emergency help			2
front - line crews have attended almost half of the phoney calls , believing them to be genuine emergencies			0
also on the list is a woman from @entity46 who called to say she was locked out of the house , while a man in @entity49 called to say his feet hurt after wearing shoes that were too small			0
in @entity53 , @entity54 , a man told 999 staff : ' i have been dieting and feel lethargic			0
' @entity57 , @entity58 , asked people to use common - sense when calling , adding that misguided or hoax calls could cost lives			1
@entity63 on @entity65 ambulance revealed the bizarre calls as part of a list of 1,248 inappropriate call outs , saying that crew attended half of them , potentially putting lives at risk ( file image ) he said : ' we 're an emergency service and our front - line staff are trained to save lives			1
' however , sadly , some of the calls we receive are not even medically related and we will refer hoax calls to the police			1
' we prioritise all life - threatening calls to get the quickest possible response			0
' however , that response can be affected if our call handlers and front - line staff are dealing with inappropriate 999 calls			0
' we would strongly urge people who think it is funny to make a prank call to stop and think about the potential consequences			0
' in another strange call one woman phoned to say she felt ill after eating too much takeaway , while a man reported that his feet were hurting after wearing shoes that were too tight			2

woman reported ' someone ' had been run over , but victim was a squirrel
another man dialled 999 to say he dropped a burger which was ' bleeding '
@entity17 ambulance service *warned* hoax calls can cost lives
