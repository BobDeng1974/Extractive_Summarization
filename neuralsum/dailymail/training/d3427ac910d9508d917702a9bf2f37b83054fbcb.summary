by @entity0 it is the second most expensive street in @entity2 , with some of the most sought after properties in the country			2
but behind the doors of many of the mansions on so - called @entity10 , in @entity11 , north @entity6 , there is little in the way of opulence and luxury			1
it is estimated that a third of the homes , worth an estimated £ 350million , are in a terrible state of disrepair after lying vacant for a quarter of a century			1
the house is supposedly owned by the @entity29 royal family some are derelict after being left to the mercy of the elements , with water streaming down the walls of former ballrooms , collapsed ceilings around chandeliers , ferns and other plants growing up staircases and out of roofs			1
in others , rubble and bird droppings , as well as the carcasses of dead pigeons litter the floor			2
houses on the street are out of the price range of most @entity51 and instead attract wealthy buyers from overseas			2
the empty buildings include a row of 10 mansions , worth £ 73m , which are thought to be owned by members of the @entity29 royal family , supposedly purchased between 1989 and 1993 as boltholes to escape the turbulence in the @entity59 during @entity61 ’s dictatorship in @entity62			1
empty : the @entity63 - one of the properties thought to belong to the @entity29 royals that has been left to rot also empty is 14 - bedroomed @entity67 , which was built for the founder of the @entity71 sugar empire , and is currently on sale for £ 65million			1
of those that are occupied , some are used infrequently by their owners for short periods each year , with residents complaining that there is little in the way of a ‘ community			2
’ most are registered to companies in tax havens including the @entity84 , @entity85 , the @entity86 , @entity87 , and the @entity88 , meaning their foreign owners were able to remain anonymous and avoid paying hundreds of thousands of pounds in stamp duty when they were purchased			0
@entity92 - born dr @entity91 , a surgeon and businessman who has rented a home on the road for seven years , said he had never met his neighbours and reckoned only three of the houses were occupied full - time			0
expensive : the expansive @entity99 is on sale for £ 40million @entity101 , pictured , went on sale for £ 30million after being repossessed from its owner - a @entity106 minister another resident , an @entity108 who asked not to be named , said : ‘ ninety - five per cent of the people who live here do n’t actually live here			2
it is a terrible place to live really			0
it is very boring and the road is very busy			0
i do n’t think many people want to live in such big houses anyway			0
’ property developer @entity116 , who is renovating the former @entity29 homes , told the @entity118 that the area had become ‘ one of the most expensive wastelands in the world			1
’ ‘ not many true local residents live on the road , ’ he said			0
‘ it is the likes of the royal families of @entity29 and @entity127			1
they buy a property and do n’t do anything with it			0
no one has lived in some of these homes for 25 years and they are decaying			0
‘ when we did the searches on some of them the water authorities said they had no records of any water being used			2
’ £ 34million @entity139 is another home on ' @entity141 ' which is not being lived in pricey : the beautiful @entity67 is on the market for £ 65million there are more than 700,000 empty houses in @entity145 but politicians are divided on how they can be used to solve the national housing shortage , which is increasing by an estimated 100,000 homes a year			1
the mayor of @entity6 , @entity149 , put himself on a collision course with the government when he called for higher council tax for owners who fail to live in or rent out their properties for more than two years , saying ‘ @entity6 homes are n’t ... just blocks of bullion in the sky			1
’ @entity159 , chief executive of the @entity161 campaign group , said @entity11 epitomised ‘ everything that is wrong with the @entity6 housing market			1
’ ‘ the high values are being used as an extreme investment vehicle at the expense of homes being homes , ’ he said			0
around a third of the houses on the exclusive row are currently standing empty ‘ @entity6 ’s shortage of homes is so great that this feels immoral and dysfunctional			1
there are countless people in inadequate housing and here are homes on @entity11 that could be used			0
’ but estate agents say high vacancy rates in @entity6 , which attracts wealthy property buyers come from all over the world , are inevitable			1
@entity183 , founder of @entity184 , who has overseen more than 100 house sales on @entity11 over the past 40 years , said any attempt to interfere with what owners do with their property would be wrong			0
‘ one of the things people love about this country is its freedom and liberal views , ’ he said			0
‘ you ca n’t start affecting what people do with their assets			0

many mansions on exclusive @entity6 street left in state of disrepair
some now have water running down the walls and ferns growing on stairs
empty buildings include a row of 10 , worth £ 73m , thought to be owned by @entity29 royal family
