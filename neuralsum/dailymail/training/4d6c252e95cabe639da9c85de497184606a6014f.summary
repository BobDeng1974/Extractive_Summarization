by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 13 july 2013 data collected from @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 is being used to help people who may be a suicide risk			0
the study is focusing on former military personnel in the @entity9 where 22 veterans take their own lives every day , an average of one every 65 minutes , according to a recent government report			1
doctors working on the @entity15 , which is supported by @entity2 , are hoping that clues from social interaction will help care workers identify patients before they fatally harm themselves			1
social media : computer experts are looking for clues about the use of @entity3 and @entity2 by people at risk of killing themselves the research is a joint venture by the predictive analytics firm patterns and predictions and the @entity32			1
last year , suicides among active members of the military reached 349 , more than those killed on duty and experts believe the military culture makes those at risk less likely to ask for help or admit they need it			2
dr. @entity43 , associate director of the @entity44 at the @entity45 told @entity46 : ' we do know factors that increase risk such as depression , but our best methods rely on individuals telling us , ' the @entity15 adviser , added : ' a lot of people who die by suicide do n't tell people they 're thinking of it , so the difficulty is trying to figure out if there are other indicators that go around this problem			0
' clues : researchers are analysing data from @entity3 , @entity2 to discover people most at risk of suicide the study put together three groups using 300 anonymous medical records from the @entity72 - patients who killed themselves , those under psychiatric care and those wanting treatment			2
common issues showed up - troubled relationships , debt , job loss , post-traumatic stress , health issues and alienation			0
but computer experts discovered behaviour unique to patients who committed suicide by analysing the language in the medical reports			1
project director @entity91 told @entity46 that the project 's consulting doctors who had treated veterans were surprised not at the common behaviours , but that a computer programme could detect often subtle clues from the medical reports investigation : computer experts hope 100,000 volunteers will take part in the project to identify suicide risks among the military1 ' the technology is trying to find the stories within the stories , ' said @entity109 spokesman @entity108			1
the computers were alerted by certain language used by the former military personal such as loneliness or agitation			2
findings will not be published for some time but the project hopes to get 100,000 volunteers to take part			0
data will come from a variety of apps that will continuously upload the subjects ' social media and mobile phone interactions			1
the project accepts that to really know more about what pushes patients to suicide , the researchers have to wait for people to die			2
mr @entity91 said : it 's not a happy topic			0
i do n't think we should back away from it just because it 's taboo or so stressful , there 's no negative intent there , no creepy objective			0
this is the cost of doing business in life - or - death research			0
