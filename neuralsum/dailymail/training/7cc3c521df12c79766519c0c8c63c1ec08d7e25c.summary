by @entity1 reporter published : 07:47 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 12:53 est , 29 august 2012 a plane with 180 passengers on board was today surrounded by security forces who mistakenly believed a hijacker was on board			1
two f - 16 fighter jets were scrambled by the @entity10 to intercept the airbus , which was bound for @entity13 's @entity12 from @entity14			1
they went supersonic in their efforts to catch up - but when the plane landed , security forces discovered that there was no hijacking , and the confusion was down to miscommunication			2
the dramatic security operation - sparked when the plane 's pilot lost radio contact upon entering @entity27 airspace - came on the same day part of the airport was closed due to the discovery of an unexploded second world world bomb			1
precaution : passengers are removed from the @entity40 plane after it landed at @entity12 following a scare over a hijacking taken away : passengers are loaded on to buses at @entity12 after the hijacking scare on the @entity40 plane builders digging around @entity48 at @entity13 uncovered the device wedged deep underground			2
it will lead to questions as to how a major airport used by 45 million people a year could have built over a live bomb			0
the terminal , from which flights regularly leave for a number of @entity60 airports including @entity61 , was partially closed , with a number of flights cancelled			0
just hours later the apparent hostage situation developed			1
police said the pilot had failed to make radio contact after entering @entity27 airspace , arousing suspicion with air traffic control that the plane had been hijacked			1
security staff , ambulances and photographers - believing this was a hostage situation - surrounded the plane after it landed around 1.5km from the main terminal			1
danger : hours before the ' hijacking ' incident a terminal at @entity12 had to be closed after workmen discovered the unexploded @entity84 bomb red alert : an ambulance is seen in front of the passenger plane carrying tourists from @entity14 in @entity90 to @entity13 's @entity12 delays : flights from @entity12 were affected by the discovery of a @entity84 bomb near the airport 's main terminal before the hijacking alarm @entity27 military police said at the time : ' the plane has landed at @entity12			1
there is a possible hijacking and the police have surrounded the plane			0
' we are trying to make contact with the people in the plane			2
' national broadcaster @entity109 made phone contact with a passenger on board who told terrified listeners that the plane was calm and there was no hostage situation			1
a spokesman for @entity90 's @entity40 airline later revealed the reports that the plane had been hijacked were due to miscommunication between the pilot and the control tower			2
dramatic : an amateur photographer took these photos showing the plane flying into @entity27 airspace with the fighter behind it catching up : the fighter behind the jet before it landed at @entity12 in @entity13 the airline said on @entity134 on wednesday that ' @entity13 's protocol for security was activated owing to a temporary loss of communication between the plane and air traffic control			1
' the @entity40 plane was parked at a remote corner of @entity12 , away from the main terminal , surrounded by security personnel and several ambulances			1
early authorities evacuated parts of the airport after workers found the unexploded bomb , forcing airlines to delay and cancel some flights			0
the @entity154 bomb was discovered buried underground near the transport hub 's busy @entity48 , which handles flights to most major @entity158 destinations , the @entity10 said in a statement			0
@entity12 cleared and closed @entity48 , parts of @entity162 and one landing strip , an airport spokeswoman said			2
a handful of @entity158 flights were cancelled , while several dozen were delayed , she added			0
the 500kg explosive , uncovered during construction work , would be taken to a safe location and dismantled , the ministry said			0
stand back : a security guard directs traffic away from the plane , which had 180 passengers on board , after it landed a mile from the main terminal security measure : an unexpectedly dramatic day at @entity12 saw a @entity84 bomb discovered and a hijacking alarm within hours of each other the bomb is thought to have been dropped by the @entity181 or @entity182 during raids between 1940 and 1944 , when @entity12 was used by the @entity154 @entity184			1
there were regular day and night raids on the then military airbase , especially because the @entity189 airforce could use it to launch raids on nearby countries including @entity60			0
@entity194 bombs weighing 550lb were regularly dropped , all containing complicated chemical fuses which could trigger at any time			0
the @entity181 and @entity198 dropped huge payloads of bombs on @entity189 positions all over the @entity27 , as part of the 2.8million tons used to flatten vast areas of @entity154 - occupied @entity158			2
this figure compares to the relatively small figure of 75,000 tons of bombs unleashed by the @entity184 on @entity60			0
even though the war ended 67 years ago , ordnance is still found all over @entity209 , just as it is in neighbouring countries such as @entity211 , and @entity154 itself			0
however , it is highly unusual to find a bomb in a heavily populated area like one of the world ’s biggest airports			0
some 48million people travel through @entity12 every year – ensuring that questions will be asked as to how one of its major terminals was allowed to be built on top of an unexploded bomb			2
a major inquiry is expected to be launched in to today ’s find			0
twice the terror : schiphol airport was partially closed earlier today after an unexploded @entity84 bomb was found during excavation works , pictured controlled blast : could the unexploded bomb found at @entity12 be detonated in a controlled explosion like a similar - sized device was yesterday in @entity236 , @entity154 ? menace : thousands of unexploded @entity84 bombs ( like this one found in @entity236 , pictured ) , are thought to be buried across @entity158			1
