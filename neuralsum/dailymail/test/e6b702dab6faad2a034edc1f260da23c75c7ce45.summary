souvenir : a shot glass bought as a reminder of what should have been a jovial trip lies on the ground a sign indicating the entrance to the site in eastern @entity4 is forbidden is displayed as @entity8 and @entity22 investigators search for debris the debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to @entity194 in @entity4 , before being taken to the @entity8 a week long recovery operation in november was delayed by fighting between separatists and @entity4 troops			1

after a ceasefire was called in february , @entity8 experts returned the following month , yet still much debris remains at the site a preliminary report in september , which apportioned no blame , said the plane ' broke up in the air probably as the result of structural damage caused by a large number of high - energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside '			0
@entity231 and the @entity232 have claimed that separatists or @entity14 forces , using a @entity13 surface - to - air missile supplied by @entity236 , were responsible for the shooting down of @entity3			2
the @entity238 strongly refutes the charge , and senior @entity14 sources have claimed that a @entity4 warplane blasted @entity3 out of the sky			1

leaks suggest that investigators suspect regular troops rather than rebels were involved in the shooting of a @entity13 missile , and that these soldiers ' might have changed their identities or even been executed by @entity14 secret service in order to hide everything '			0

alleged intercepted phone calls between rebels seem to back up the version that the plane was downed by a @entity13 crew using equipment smuggled in and out from @entity14			1
if this could be proven , it would blow apart the @entity14 denial of involvement in eastern @entity4 quite apart from its assistance that it had nothing to do with the downing of @entity3			1
but as one source close to investigators said : ' it looks like key evidence and witnesses , namely the @entity13 missile and its crew , have been hidden deep inside @entity14 which is in denial over this whole episode			2
' probably the inquiry report will blame the attack on a @entity13 missile , but seeing anyone face justice over this crash is quite another matter			0
' the dead from @entity3 comprised 192 @entity8 citizens ( one also had @entity319 citizenship ) , 44 @entity22 , including the 15 crew members , 27 @entity109 , 12 @entity320 , ten @entity321 ( one also had @entity323 citizenship ) , four @entity317 , four @entity324 , three @entity325 , one @entity326 and one @entity327 .			1
