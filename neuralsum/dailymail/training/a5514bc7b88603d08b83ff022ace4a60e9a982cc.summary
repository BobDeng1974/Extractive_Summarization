blueprints for how to build a 3d - plastic gun remain easily accessible via the internet , despite the @entity3 ordering the website which initially posted the plans to remove them			1
on thursday , @entity6 was forced to take the blueprints down from its site by the @entity9 @entity3 on the basis that they could violate possible arms trafficking violations			1
but now the plans have been uploaded to torrent site @entity15 multiple times , and have already been downloaded from the site thousands of times			1
' @entity15 has for close to 10 years been operating without taking down one single torrent due to pressure from the outside			1
and it will never start doing that , ' a pirate bay insider told @entity35 , which first pointed out the @entity37 gun on the now - @entity39 site			1
now that the blueprints for the gun have appeared online it will become increasingly difficult to track how many other sites are also hosting them			1
the main thing preventing more 3d guns from being printed at this time is the limited availability of 3d printers themselves			0
bang : this is the moment defense distributed founder @entity52 successfully fired the first working plastic gun made by a @entity37 printer the blueprints , that can be produced on a @entity37 printer costing as little as $ 1,000 , were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition			1
the plans were quickly downloaded more than 100,000 times since it was posted to the web on monday			1
surprisingly , most downloads of the plans did not come from inside the @entity9 but from @entity68			0
the @entity9 was second , ahead of @entity69 , @entity70 , and the @entity71 , according to @entity72 , a developer working with @entity6 , who reported the statistics to @entity75			1
the @entity3 @entity76 ordered @entity52 , the 25 - year - old founder of the site , to remove the online blueprints for the @entity80 ' handgun , @entity75 reported			1
the @entity3 office is reviewing whether the files violate export control laws for weapons , known as the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) , since the plans were downloaded overseas			1
crude : the @entity80 plastic gun is a simple single - shot weapon that fires a small .380 - caliber bullet @entity52 , currently a law student at the @entity91 in @entity92 , says his group will comply with the @entity3 directive			1
on sunday , the group @entity6 posted a video of founder @entity52 firing the ' @entity98 ' plastic pistol			1
mr @entity52 made the schematics for the weapon available for free online this week - meaning everyone with a high - end @entity37 printer can create their own version of the gun			2
in response , @entity108 senator @entity107 announced that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban the weapons because they can pass through metal detectors at airports and court houses without being picked up			1
' we ’re facing a situation where anyone - a felon , a terrorist - can open a gun factory in their garage and the weapons they make will be undetectable			1
it ’s stomach - churning , ' he said			2
plastic : sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the @entity80 are plastic , constructed by a @entity37 printer			0
a small nail is used for a firing pin sixteen of the 17 parts in the @entity80 pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the @entity135 3d printer			1
the final piece of the weapons - the firing pin - is a common nail			1
mr @entity52 told @entity75 that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them			2
it is a bid , he says , to keep governments accountable to the people			0
' you can print a lethal device			0
it ’s kind of scary , but that ’s what we ’re aiming to show , ' he said			0
' anywhere there ’s a computer and an internet connection , there would be the promise of a gun			0
' the name of the @entity159 - comes from a simple @entity161 pistol that was designed by the @entity9 military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied @entity165 and concentration camps			1
like its @entity161 predecessor , the @entity6 pistol is a crude weapon			1
it holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore			0
shocking : @entity108 senator @entity107 plans to introduce legislation that would ban plastic guns made from @entity37 printers @entity37 printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine , to construction to aerospace			0
the process , also called additive manufacturing , creates a three - dimensional solid object from a digital model			2
the feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic			0
the layers are then joined together to create the final shape			0
the machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and ' slices ' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing			2
the process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s			0
however , since 2010 , an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3 - d printers , which are increasingly small , increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable			2
@entity6 used a higher - end $ 8,000 model to build its @entity37 gun			1
however entry - level desktop models can cost $ 500 to $ 1,000			2
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
engineers hope 3 - d printing will begin an era of ' instant prototyping ' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively			2
the group has successfully fired it with a .380 - caliber pistol round			2
however , an attempt to shoot a slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces			0
currently , the @entity80 can only be made through highly specialized processes on an $ 8,000 3 - d printer			2
mr @entity52 says he hopes to adapt the model the technology behind 3 - d printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades			0
it is only since about 2010 , though , that 3 - d printers have become cheap enough , simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to purchase			0
@entity107 says the accessibility of @entity37 printers makes plastic guns a security threat			0
' guns are made out of plastic , so they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or sporting event , ' @entity107 said , according @entity247			0
' only metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to be detected by metal detectors , for instance , when you go through an airport			1
' a terrorist , someone who ’s mentally ill , a spousal abuser , a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage			0
' @entity107 wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new bill would add a ban on plastic high - capacity magazines			2
' people have made silencers , stocks , triggers and lots of other gun parts			0
they can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone with one of these printers - and the printers cost about $ 1,000 - can make one , ' @entity107 said			2
current law bans all - plastic weaponry			0
defense distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle , to get around the law			1
@entity107 says the metal can be swapped out and replaced with plastic			0
production : in an instruction video , the @entity37 printed gun is shown being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home process : video shows the team beginning to assemble the gun after each part was printed and cleaned			0

the @entity3 demanded @entity6 remove the blueprints from their site
but *copies* of the *documents* have been found on peer - to - peer file sharing sites such as @entity15
pistol uses only one metal piece - a small nail for the firing pin
blueprints for the weapons were downloaded 100,000 times in two days
