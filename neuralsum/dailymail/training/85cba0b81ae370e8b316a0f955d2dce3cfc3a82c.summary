@entity0 is throwing its money , brain power and technology at the humble spoon			0
but these spoons are a bit more than your basic utensil : using hundreds of algorithms , they allow people with essential tremors and parkinson 's disease to eat without spilling			1
the technology senses how a hand is shaking and makes instant adjustments to stay balanced			2
in clinical trials , the @entity18 spoons reduced shaking of the spoon bowl by an average of 76 percent			1
in clinical trials , the @entity18 spoons reduced shaking of the spoon bowl by an average of 76 percent			1
' we want to help people in their daily lives today and hopefully increase understanding of disease in the long run , ' @entity0 spokesperson @entity28 said			1
other adaptive devices have been developed to help people with tremors — rocker knives , weighted utensils , pen grips			1
but until now , experts say , technology has not been used in this way			0
' it 's totally novel , ' said @entity46 neurologist dr. @entity45 , who specializes in movement disorders like parkinson 's disease and essential tremors			1
she helped advise the inventors and says the device , which has a fork attachment , has been a remarkable asset for some of her patients			0
' i have some patients who could n't eat independently , they had to be fed , and now they can eat on their own , ' she said			2
' it does n't cure the disease — they still have tremor — but it 's a very positive change			1
' @entity0 got into the no - shake utensil business in september , acquiring a small , national of institutes of health - funded startup called @entity66 for an undisclosed sum			0
the technology senses how a hand is shaking and makes instant adjustments to stay balanced			2
in clinical trials , the @entity18 spoons reduced shaking of the spoon bowl by an average of 76 percent			1
' the idea is to use active cancellation ( which is currently in noise cancelling headphones ) to stabilize larger scale motion , ' said @entity79 , it 's inventor			2
' at the @entity82 , i was doing my phd on new materials that can be used for active cancellation in the military			0
' i figured out how to make the hardware for active cancellation of human tremor very small , and realized that this would be the perfect application for active cancellation technology			0
' in his studies , @entity79 noticed little technology has been developed to help people with essential tremor and parkinson 's disease			1
' people have tried making contraptions that force a person 's tremor to cease , but these looked like robotic arms that i would hate to use in public			1
' i thought that the concept of active cancellation would be of huge help here			0
' more than 10 million people worldwide , including @entity0 co-founder @entity106 's mother , have essential tremors or parkinson 's disease			1
@entity106 has said he also has a mutation associated with higher rates of @entity111 's and has donated more than $ 50 million to research for a cure			2
but the @entity66 acquisition was not related , @entity28 said			0
@entity79 , a senior hardware engineer at @entity0 , shows off the prototype of the @entity116 he developed that helps people eat without spilling in @entity119 , @entity120 lift @entity121 founder @entity79 said moving from a small , four - person startup in @entity123 to the vast @entity0 campus in @entity119 has freed him up to be more creative as he explores how to apply the technology even more broadly			1
his team works at the search giant 's division called @entity0 ( x ) @entity129 , which is also developing a smart contact lens that measures glucose levels in tears for diabetics and is researching how nanoparticles in blood might help detect diseases			2
joining @entity0 has been motivating , said @entity79 , but his focus remains on people who are now able to eat independently with his device			1
' if you build something with your hands and it has that sort of an impact , it 's the greatest feeling ever , ' he said			2
' as an engineer who likes to build things , that 's the most validating thing that can happen			2
' @entity79 said they also hope to add sensors to the spoons to help medical researchers and providers better understand , measure and alleviate tremors			1
@entity156 , 65 , who is an essential tremor patient , uses a @entity116 to eat without spilling at her home in @entity159 , @entity120 not surprisingly , the company that has brought the driverless car and @entity163 glasses is bringing a unique improvement to the utensils			1
built with hundreds of algorithms , these specially designed spoons make it much easier for people with tremors and @entity111 to eat without spilling			1
@entity156 , 65 , of @entity159 , has had an essential tremor for about a decade			0
she was at her monthly @entity173 group at a @entity175 medical clinic earlier this year when researchers developing the device introduced the idea and asked if anyone was interested in helping them			0
as it was refined , she tried it out and gave them feedback			0
and when they hit the market at $ 295 apiece , she bought one			0
without the spoon , @entity156 said eating was really a challenge because her hands trembled so hard food fell off the utensils before she could eat it			0
' i was shaking and i had a hard time to keep the food on a spoon , especially soup or something like an olive or tomatoes or something			0
it 's very frustrating , ' she said			0
the spoon definitely improved her situation			0
' i was surprised that i held the food in there so much better			0
it makes eating much easier , especially if i 'm out at a restaurant , ' she said			0
the @entity116 , that helps people with eat without spilling , in its packaging at @entity0 headquarters in @entity119 , @entity120			1

allow people with tremors and parkinson 's disease to eat without spilling
@entity18 spoons reducee shaking by an average of 76 percent
