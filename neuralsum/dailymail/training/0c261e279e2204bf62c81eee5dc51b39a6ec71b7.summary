@entity1 's maiden visit to the @entity2 culminated with the @entity3 emerging top dog in practice on friday			1
situated in the @entity9 mountains , the circuit - owned by billionaire energy drinks magnate @entity10 - is an old - school track complemented by modern - day facilities following a Â£ 60million revamp			0
the circuit itself , last used in @entity16 in 2003 , has remained unaltered since that visit 11 years ago , much to the delight of the drivers			2
leading the way : @entity1 ended the afternoon on top of the timesheets from @entity23 top dog : the @entity3 was fastest at the @entity2 as he bids to get his championship charge back on track at just a fraction over two miles it is the third shortest circuit on the current calendar behind @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity32 , but provides the fastest lap. coming into this weekend half the field had sampled the circuit via one form or another , be it in @entity16 many years ago , a junior formula or a track day			1
@entity1 , however , conceded a fortnight ago his knowledge of the circuit was such he did not even know the direction of turn one			2
but come the conclusion to the two 90 - minute sessions it was the 29 - year - old who led the way with a time of one minute 09.542secs , just 1.2secs slower than @entity52 's race lap record set in 2003			1
making his point : @entity23 is 22 points ahead of team - mate @entity1 in their battle for the championship with the fastest of @entity59 's four compound tyres - the supersofts - strapped on to the @entity61 , @entity1 finished 0.377secs faster than team - mate @entity23 as the duo resumed their battle for this season 's formula one world title			1
after retiring a fortnight ago in @entity67 , @entity1 is again in need of a run of victories to close the 22 - point gap that has now opened up between himself and @entity23 , who has not been out of the top two all season after seven races			1
the pair were the only two drivers to dip under 70 seconds over the course of the undulating lap that incorporates just nine corners			0
as in the first practice session , when @entity23 edged @entity1 on the soft - compound rubber , @entity82 's @entity81 was again third best but only just from @entity86 duo @entity85 and @entity87			1
off track : world champion @entity89 loses control of his @entity92 at the final corner spinning around : but the @entity94 escaped the incident without any damage to his car reigning four - times champion @entity89 and team - mate @entity100 , winner last time out in @entity67 to end @entity61 ' dominant start to the campaign of six successive victories , were sixth and eighth quickest on the timesheet			2
in @entity106 , @entity89 was fortunate to avoid a smash into a barrier on the opposite side of the pit wall			0
coming out of the final corner , @entity89 caught the grass and twice spun through 360 degrees , avoiding the barrier by inches , with his car remarkably ending up back on the circuit and pointing in the right direction			0
@entity89 and @entity100 sandwiched @entity117 's @entity116 , who finished 1.271secs down in a car boasting a number of upgrades this weekend , with his own team - mate in @entity124 ninth			0
driving force : @entity16 is back in @entity126 after an 11 - year absence @entity129 's @entity128 was again 10th , as in @entity130 , with @entity131 seemingly struggling again in his @entity82 as the @entity132 was down in 11th , almost a second and a half back			1
@entity135 's @entity134 was in 18th , ahead of not only team - mate @entity136 , but also the @entity137 of @entity138 , with the young briton 2.687secs off the pace			0
throughout session two in particular , virtually every driver ran wide at the turn eight right - hander , which is to result in a warning from race director @entity146			0
given drivers could be penalised throughout the race for exceeding track limits , a timing screen message in @entity151 confirmed @entity146 is to " inform the drivers of the future policy " with regard to turn eight .			0

@entity61 led the way on friday with @entity157 **adrift** of @entity1
@entity81 was best of the rest ahead of @entity85 and @entity87
@entity16 is back in @entity126 for the first time since 2003
@entity1 starts the weekend 22 points **adrift** of @entity23 in race for the title
