former @entity66 star @entity65 also ran the marathon wearing make - up ' also , there have been several innovations with waterproof make - up recently , products that breathe with your skin when you work - out and will stay absolutely perfect even when you are pushing yourself hard physically , so it 's much easier to look good working out			1
' most women are likely to be at the gym for at least an hour ; so you want to look your best just in case you bump into someone you know ... or someone you might like to know			0
' and if you are trying to tone up bits of your body about which you might feel a bit self - conscious , you do n't want to add to that by not feeling the best about your face			0
' the research found that the gym was n't the only place that @entity10 women were likely to wear make - up			1
