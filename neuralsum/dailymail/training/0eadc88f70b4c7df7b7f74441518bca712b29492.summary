a quick dip in the pool can sound appealing - until you realise you ’ll be left wearing dripping swimwear for the rest of the day			0
now one @entity6 - based entrepreneur has come up with a range of swim trunks that means you can avoid leaving a trail of puddles in your wake			2
inventor , @entity12 , has set - up a @entity14 fund for a swimwear range which is made from hydrophobic material - a fabric that repels water			1
‘ we were tired of having to change shorts every time you leave the beach , having car seats soaked and not being able to go from the beach to a restaurant , ’ mr @entity12 said			1
created by @entity6 - based entrepreneur , @entity12 , the swim trunks are made from a unique polyester - based hydrophobic material with prices starting from $ 47 ( £ 28 ) it looks like ordinary swimwear , but when covered in liquid , the ‘ @entity43 ’ trunks instantly repels water ‘ we decided to look at different topical applications for use but shortly found out they changed the texture of the fabric and had no way of being used on garments			1
‘ we decided to scrap the idea and look for the perfect alternative			0
’ what mr @entity12 and his team came up with was a polyester - blend hydrophobic nanomaterial technology			1
the technology is thought to work by bonding billions of nanoparticles to individual fibres on a microscopic level			1
when water - based liquids hit the surface of this material they form a 150 - degree sphere and roll off			1
‘ this fabric has proven to drastically reduce dry - times by up to 95 per cent in contrast to regular 100 per cent polyester swim shorts , ’ the company claims			1
the technology works by bonding billions of nanoparticles to individual fibres on a microscopic level			1
when water - based liquids hit the surface of this material they form a 150 - degree sphere and roll off ‘ this fabric has proven to drastically reduce dry - times by up to 95 per cent in contrast to regular 100 per cent polyester swim shorts , ’ the company claims hydrophobic nanotech clothing has been around for a number of years , but it always has a limited lifespan			1
for instance , the @entity89 water - repelling t - shirt , was released last year but can only maintain its properties for 80 washes			2
the ‘ @entity43 ’ swimwear , however , promises that its water - repellent abilities last for the last - time of the shorts			0
the range comes in a variety of different colours and patterns , with trunks starting from $ 47 ( £ 28 )			0
if the @entity14 campaign is a success , mr @entity12 expects to begin shipping in july			2
if you 're clumsy and constantly spilling food down yourself , or just lazy and do n't like washing your clothes , a student has invented the answer to your problems - a t - shirt that is impossible to stain			0
the tops can resist any spills and splashes including @entity114 , tomato ketchup , mustard , milkshakes , beer , ink and even red wine			0
the clothing is made from polyester , which has been infused with a combination of chemicals that make it resistant to water			0
despite this , the t - shirts are said to feel ‘ no different to any other items that could be found in a clothing shop			0
’ university student @entity131 from @entity132 made a prototype using a spray - on chemical , but realised it would only last for one wash			0
he then began looking at ways to incorporate the technology into the fabric			0
he created a fabric that has the nanotechnology bonded to the fibres on a microscopic level			1
this means they wo n't irritate the skin			0
according to @entity131 : ‘ most liquid molecules will not be able to touch the fabric because of a microscopic layer of air that forms between the liquid and fabric			2
‘ this is because the fabric is layered with billions of silica particles			0
water based liquids will form a 150 degree sphere and roll right off ! as a result , this barrier protects your shirt from potential accidents			2
’ the material in the @entity166 shirt , pictured , created by @entity132 - based student @entity131 , has billions of silica particles bonded to the fibres			2
water - based liquids form a 150 - degree sphere on this material and roll off			1

a @entity14 fund to sell trunks has been launched by @entity12
inventor said he was tired of having his car seats soaked after a swim
he *developed* a polyester - blend hydrophobic material that repels liquid
it works by bonding nanoparticles to fibres on a microscopic level
when water hits the fabric , the nanoparticles create a sphere causing the liquid to roll off
