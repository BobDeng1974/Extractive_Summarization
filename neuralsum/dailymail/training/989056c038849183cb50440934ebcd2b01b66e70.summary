a boy from @entity3 has been banned from attending a @entity5 primary school because ‘ hysterical ’ parents are worried about ebola , his mother said yesterday			1
@entity8 , nine , was due to spend several days at @entity10 ’s @entity9 in @entity11 , @entity12 , as part of an annual visit			1
but despite being tested for ebola and given the all - clear on his arrival in @entity5 last week , parents mounted a campaign to have @entity8 ’s trip cancelled , saying they feared he could pass on the deadly virus to their children			1
mrs @entity32 , who moved to @entity3 from @entity55 to set up an education charity 14 years ago , said : ‘ we are being treated like lepers and it ’s very sad			1
‘ the school and its governors have been extremely supportive , but i ’m afraid they ’ve been put under undue pressure by an aggressive minority spreading panic and ignorance about this virus			1
‘ i am a reasonable citizen and mother – there is no way i would be wandering around with my nine - year - old if he had ebola			1
we have had one case in @entity5 , but just one , because we contain it			0
anger : parents campaigned against @entity8 or his @entity5 mother @entity26 ( right ) going to the school , fearing they could pass on the disease which has killed at least 678 people in @entity3 plan : the pair flew into @entity40 last tuesday , where @entity8 is pictured , and it had been planned that @entity8 would attend classes at @entity10 's while he and his mother stayed with family friends in @entity12 ‘ it is a difficult disease to catch but that point has not been taken on by these ignorant parents			1
we have absolutely no contact with sick people – we ’re an education charity			1
’ mrs @entity32 set up @entity93 , an organisation which aims to educate vulnerable children in @entity3 , with her brother in 2000			1
it teaches 3,000 youngsters across nine boarding schools , mostly in rural locations			0
in 2003 , she married a local tailor , @entity101 , and @entity8 was born in @entity55 in 2005 , but the family moved back to @entity3 four weeks later			1
mr @entity8 died in 2009 , aged just 35 , of an infection which mrs @entity32 believes he would have survived if treated in the @entity5			2
after his death , the charity worker decided she never wanted to travel without her son			2
education : @entity8 was due to join @entity108 's on a placement while mrs @entity32 carries out fundraising visits to other schools as part of her work with charity @entity114 missing out : mrs @entity32 said she and her son had been met with ' leper - type attitudes ' from people ' over-reacting ' since their arrival in the @entity5 student : @entity8 has been going to classes at @entity10 's since he was three and he has friends there model pupil : @entity8 with some of his certificates heralding his progress in maths mrs @entity32 returns to @entity5 twice a year to give talks to schools about the charity ’s work in @entity130 , so @entity8 always accompanies her			1
once he reached school age , @entity8 was offered an annual placement at @entity10 ’s during his mother ’s visits and would attend classes for up to a month each year			1
in a letter to parents , mrs @entity50 said it was with a ‘ heavy heart ’ that she and the school governors had decided to cancel @entity8 ’s visit because of ‘ misguided hysteria ’ of some parents			1
she wrote : ‘ a significant number of parents have been in touch with me to express their fears			2
' there are many parents who believe that the visit should have gone ahead and that we are contributing to misunderstandings by cancelling it			2
work : mrs @entity8 's charity has been trying to raise much needed funds to help children who have been orphaned by @entity44 or other diseases reassuring : in a newsletter sent out last month , the school reassured parents with advice from @entity29 that symptomless people travelling from @entity130 , like @entity8 , are not infectious visiting : @entity8 attends the school when he visits the @entity5 with his @entity5 mother to see family and friends ‘ in this instance , it has been very hard to juggle justice to @entity26 and the views of parents			1
no risk : last month the school tried to reassure parents via a newsletter that the visit posed no risk ‘ it is with great sadness that we decided to cancel the visit ; the misguided hysteria emerging is extremely disappointing , distracting us from our core purpose of educating your children and is not an environment that i would wish a visitor to experience			2
’ parents yesterday defended their stance			0
@entity191 , 36 , said he had considered removing his two sons from the school if @entity8 joined their classes			1
he added : ‘ all the information we get in the media is that this disease has an incubation over 21 days , as far as we are concerned he could be ill by day 20 – who knows ? ' the risk is not worth taking			0
i absolutely would be worried if he was here			0
’ @entity204 , 40 , said the school were right to cancel @entity8 ’s visit			1
she added : ‘ you ca n’t risk anything with children			0
even if they tested negative , the next day they could be positive			0
‘ i would be worried if they had let him come here			0
it has n’t been a major panic , just some parents emailing the head			0
’ but @entity216 , whose two grandchildren are at the school , said : ‘ i think the school were over-reacting but they have got to listen to parents			2
' if they are clear of the disease , i do n’t see the problem			0
’ pupil : @entity8 last visited the school in july , and tends to take classes there two or three times a year safety : mrs @entity8 said many schools in @entity3 have been closed due to @entity44 , and children there , like @entity8 , know to avoid physical contact ' heartbreaking ' : mrs @entity8 said there had been ' so much pressure from an ignorant parent body that the school had to act ' family : @entity8 pictured as a toddler with his mother @entity26 , and father , tailor @entity101 - who died from an infection in 2009 donation : headteacher @entity50 suggested to parents that a sizeable donation should be made instead to @entity93 to recognise its work in a country ' which has received more than its share of setbacks ' concern : @entity191 , 36 , who has two sons at school said he felt that the school had made the right choice , but that he felt sorry for @entity8 mothers : @entity257 , 33 , ( left ) said parents had threatened to remove their children from the school if @entity8 had been allowed into lessons , while @entity204 , 40 , ( right ) who has one daughter at school said the school had made the right choice , given the risk involved ' overreaction ' : @entity216 , whose two grandchildren go to the school , said staff had overreacted predictions : a team of scientists at @entity272 in @entity273 have used air travel information to predict where the deadly ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks aid and charity workers providing care under the @entity281 programme will have their risk assessed when they return to the @entity5 , and if they are well , will be placed into one of three monitoring groups			1
mrs @entity8 and @entity286 need not need to be tested , but did so of their own volition			2
category 1 a person who has visited an @entity44 affected area , but had no direct contact with an @entity44 case ( or body fluids ) while they were there			0
there are no restrictions on the activities of people in this category - they can return to their usual activities and there is no requirement for them to be monitored			0
@entity8 and his mother fall into this category			2

they are required to check their own temperature twice daily for 21 days after return , and to report any raised temperature of over 38 ° c or other relevant symptoms to a named health protection team at @entity29 ( @entity29 )			0
category 3 a person who had direct or close contact with @entity44 cases ( or body fluids ) while they were in the affected area , wore appropriate protective equipment or clothing , but are concerned that they may have had a breach in these protective measures or have had direct contact with an @entity44 patient ’s blood , urine or secretions without being protected			0

they are required to check their own temperature twice daily for 21 days after return , and to report daily to a named health protection team at @entity29 , even if they do n’t have a raised temperature over 38 ° c or other suspicious symptoms			0

she moved to @entity3 to set up an education charity 14 years ago
@entity385 bowed to the pressure and stopped him attending classes
