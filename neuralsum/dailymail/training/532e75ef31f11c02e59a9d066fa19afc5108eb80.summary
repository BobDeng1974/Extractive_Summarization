researchers are rushing to develop a pin - prick test for @entity2 that could cut life - saving days off the amount of time it takes to confirm cases of the deadly virus			1
scientists say developing a test for @entity2 that gives an instant result could be vital is stopping the march of the disease , which has killed more than 4,000 people in west africa so far and is spreading			1
scientists at @entity16 in @entity17 are working in conjunction with the @entity19 in @entity20 on a simple pin - prick test to provide an instant @entity2 diagnosis			1
under current protocols it can take three days for a blood sample to be tested in a lab which can increase the risk of a patient transmitting @entity2 to other people			2
in addition to reducing the wait time for results , the system under development uses a simple pin - prick device that dramatically reduces the chance of healthcare workers suffering needle - stick injuries associated with traditional long syringes			1
' everyone has their shoulder to the wheel to get this done , ' dr @entity39 told @entity67			0
he said his team has been working around the clock to increase the accuracy of the test which is designed to identify the specific proteins associated with the disease			2
the research is being backed by $ 2.9 million grant			1
the new system is undergoing a series of tests to determine its accuracy			0
once his team is convinced the test works , dr @entity39 said it was hoped the @entity83 will fast - track authorisation so the test can be deployed at airports and in the field			2
a rapid system of identifying @entity2 could help stop the spread of the deadly virus researchers hope the @entity83 will fast - track their diagnosis test so it can be deployed as quickly as possible dr @entity39 said he has lost six of his colleagues battling the disease and wants the new test ready as quickly as possible			1
he said @entity2 's arrival in the @entity97 will create a greater urgency for action			2
@entity27 man @entity100 in a @entity102 hospital on october 8 after bringing the virus to the @entity97 from @entity104			0
@entity105 , a nurse who treated @entity100 , has been confirmed as the second @entity2 infection in the @entity97			0
dr @entity39 said : ' i think it 's pretty clear to people here that we ca n't allow that situation to spiral and spiral and spiral out of control			0
we 're one people â€” we ca n't say it 's happening in one part of the planet and not here			0
' the @entity117 says 4,033 confirmed , probable or suspected @entity2 deaths have now been recorded .			0

researchers have received a $ 2.9 million grant to develop a rapid @entity2 test
the pin - prick field test will diagnose the killer disease in a matter of minutes
scientists claim an early diagnosis will help medics *counter* @entity2 's spread
