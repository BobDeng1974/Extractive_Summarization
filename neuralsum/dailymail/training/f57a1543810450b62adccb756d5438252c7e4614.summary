@entity1 mp @entity0 , 64 , is the mp for the strait - laced @entity3 cathedral city of @entity1 there are colourful @entity6			1
his commons office , preposterously modelled on the @entity10 @entity9 , is a riot of red , white and blue giant @entity12 , @entity14 banners			0
there is a ukulele on his desk			0
his hair is an ‘ enhanced ’ yellow , straw like thatch			1
he is wearing pink and blue socks			0
even they pale into insignificance when he opens his mouth			0
he no sooner has a @entity25 thought than he blurts it out , or tweets it			0
it got him sacked as @entity29 vice chairman earlier this year when , bizarrely , he tweeted about having sex with a llama and disowned a conservative minister in an expenses scandal and the @entity35 rail link			1
@entity0 ’s latest battle is with @entity37 who tried to ban him from a gay rights reception at the speaker ’s official residence a few weeks ago – only to be shamed into backing down by a @entity42 tweet			2
@entity0 saw it as a lame attempt by @entity37 to repay him for exposing how the speaker told a senior commons official to ‘ f * * * off ’			1
‘ one minute it was “ you appalling little s * * * , do n’t ever darken our door ” , next it was “ what we meant is , of course you ’re welcome ”			0
’ so perhaps i should not be surprised to be sitting in his commons office as the exotic mp for the strait - laced @entity3 cathedral city of @entity1 : openly discusses intimate details of his sex life and his relationship with soulmate @entity64 , boss of @entity66			1
reveals how ‘ xenophobic and homophobic ’ fellow @entity29 @entity6 made him want to vote for @entity68			1
jokes about his ‘ bromance ’ with @entity71 and the ‘ @entity74 ’ antics of @entity29 chairman @entity73			1
@entity0 had cause to be annoyed by @entity37 ’s attempt to exclude him from the reception for @entity77			2
the gay rights website wanted to thank @entity0 for calling for curbs on gay blood donors to be scrapped			2
the mp puts it as only he can : ‘ if you are a straight guy screwing three girls a night and never use a condom , you can give blood			2
but if you are a gay bloke in a monogamous relationship having safe sex , unless you sign an affidavit that you have been celibate for 12 months , you ca n’t			2
‘ i mean , come on ! ’ he guffaws			2
‘ most gay people i know can barely be celibate for 12 hours			0
’ it is not always easy to tell @entity0 ’s campaigns and quips apart			1
but there is no mistaking his loathing of @entity94 – ‘ petty and volatile , needs an anger management course ’			2
beneath his flamboyance and @entity105 , being the @entity98 son of a @entity100 intelligence officer who became a rabbi after learning of the @entity103 left its mark			0
hear him scoff at the way he was fired by @entity73 earlier this year : ‘ he was only obeying orders , as @entity74 would have said			0
’ @entity111 ’s henchman @entity74 ran the death camps that traumatised @entity0 ’s father – though the jibe is clumsy , to say the least , bearing in mind @entity73 is also from a @entity98 family			1
@entity0 clammed up when asked about his hair , other than to admit that it was ' enhanced ' on a slightly lesser scale , on entering politics in 1992 after making a pile selling equipment to foreign radio stations , @entity0 junior was shocked by the ‘ xenophobic , misogynistic and homophobic ’ @entity29 benches			1
imitating a pukkah colonel ’s voice , he recalls in disgust a debate on ending the ban on gays in the @entity131 in which a fellow conservative mp warned : ’ we ’ll have soldiers in pink feather boas proposing to each other			2
’ ‘ if i had n’t been a @entity29 mp in the 1997 election , i would probably have voted for @entity68 , ’ he says			1
@entity138 tried to tempt @entity0 to defect but he refused , saying , to derision from most , that he would wait until a ‘ @entity29 ’ party came round to his ‘ liberal ’ views on gays , ethnic minorities and women ’s rights			1
many at @entity146 deride him as more twit than @entity148			0
but there was nothing silly about being among the first @entity151 to warn @entity152 of the ‘ foolishness ’ of dismissing @entity154 as ‘ fruitcakes , closet racists andloonies ’			1
or about his recent behind - the - scenes intervention to stop young commons interns being preyed on			0
@entity0 , a preternaturally boyish 64 , has never married , and shares a remote £ 300,000 @entity161 holiday home with his very close friend of nearly 25 years , @entity163 , chief executive of @entity66			1
@entity0 met @entity64 , 13 years his junior , when @entity163 heckled him during a speech at @entity166			1
a mutual love of walking turned into a different type of @entity66 partnership – though @entity0 has been criticised for using his position as an mp to defend @entity163 ’s @entity173 shopping empire			1
he loyally leapt to his defence on @entity148 last month when the @entity163 was forced to apologise for calling @entity175 ‘ sclerotic , downbeat and hopeless			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) described @entity66 boss , @entity163 ( left ) , who he shared a holiday home with , as a close friend are they an item ? ‘ no , ’ laughs @entity0			1
‘ frankly , if we lived together we would murder each other ! ’ he reflects sincerely : ‘ i have gone past the stage of wanting girlfriends and all the rest of it			2
i guess he ’s someone i can rely on in life and he can rely on me			0
’ before meeting @entity163 , @entity0 had relationships with women , including an @entity192 girl who came back to the @entity193 with him after he met her studying in @entity194			1
but he has no regrets at not marrying			0
‘ i have always run away from responsibilities like babies and things			0
it ’s rather selfish actually			0
in my 30s i was abroad a lot – and i enjoy the company of blokes			0
i ’m not exclusively gay [ though ] i have certainly done things with a bloke			0
’ the unconventional and almost alarmingly candid mr @entity0 states he has only had full sexual intercourse with women , not men , though the explicit terms he uses to describe it would make readers of @entity77 blush , never mind @entity212 ’s			2
he and mr street are content to have a relationship that does not involve such intimacy , he says			0
@entity0 , pictured in the @entity216 , revealed that he is having a ' bromance ' with @entity71 ‘ we can be friends without having him do things to my * * * * * * or me to his , for @entity224 ’s sake ! ’ he roars with metrosexual abandon			1
however , he is keen to point out he does have an active sex life			1
‘ i get it in one form or another quite regularly , i can tell you , ’ he chuckles			2
‘ all my bits and pieces work … they have n’t fallen off through lack of use			0
’ but not with mr street			0
‘ i give @entity64 a hug occasionally and he stands there rigid with embarrassment , ’ he laughs			1
most people are not exclusively gay or straight , elaborates mr @entity0 , but are ‘ on a form of the [ bisexual ] spectrum , though whether they do anything about it is another matter			2
’ unsurprisingly , his @entity244 favourites include fellow @entity29 free spirit and moderniser @entity71			1
‘ i ’m having a bromance with @entity0 , ’ he grins			1
less predictably , another is close friend and bluff @entity250 ex-miner transport secretary @entity249 , the least likely @entity29 cabinet minister to read @entity77			0
there is only one subject that makes mr @entity0 clam up – his ludicrous barnet			2
more like flax than real hair , and a lurid yellow from a child ’s paint box , mps swear it is a wig			0
a telltale 2in gap appears between the stiff tufts on his collar and the nape of his neck when he leans forward			0
‘ it ’s not as simple as that , ’ he replies coyly			0
all he will say is that it is ‘ enhanced ’			2
implants ? wig ? dyed ? bald silence			0
it is one area where he is not coming out			0
for all the @entity279 modernity of today ’s conservatives , some traditionalists will share the view of @entity29 grandee sir @entity282 , who interviewed young tyro @entity0 in the late 1970s			1
‘ you ’d make a marvellous mp , ’ he declaimed , somewhat to @entity0 ’s surprise			1
‘ have you tried the @entity286 ? ’ @entity0 was sacked as @entity29 vice chairman earlier this year			1
