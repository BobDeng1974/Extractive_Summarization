fertility treatment can painfully expensive and many infertile couples scrimp and save for years to be able to afford it			1
but a growing number of people are turning to a more novel way of funding treatment - getting others to donate to their cause			0
some @entity9 couples have raised up to $ 20,000 thanks to the kindness of strangers			2
one such pair are @entity14 and @entity15 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , who used a crowdfunding site to raise the $ 6,000 ( £ 3,500 ) they needed to pay for an egg donor			1
@entity14 and @entity15 raised $ 6,000 for fertility treatment through a crowdfunding website amazingly , they raised the money in just four months and are now waiting to be matched with a donor			1
they received 43 donations ranging from $ 10 to $ 500			0
the couple , who married in august 2005 and started trying for a baby a year later , became concerned when they 'd had no success after 18 months			1
mrs @entity15 , 32 , went to see a doctor , who gave her devastating news			1
not only did she have polycystic ovary syndrome and an underactive thyroid , there was a tumour on her pituitary gland in the brain			0
the gland helps control the balance of hormones in the body and a tumour on it can disrupt this function , making infertility much more likely			0
mrs @entity15 , a beauty teacher , was put on medication to balance her hormones in the hope this would enable her to conceive			1
but a year later , they had still not been successful			0
the couple were amazed to reach their fundraising target in just four months after donations flooded in in january 2011 , mrs @entity15 was told her tumour had grown and that it had haemorrhaged			1
as a result , in may 2011 , she had surgery to remove the tumour and , miraculously , in september she discovered she was pregnant			0
writing on her @entity61 crowdsourcing page , she said : ‘ at the very end of an appointment [ with my doctor ] she had me take a pregnancy test , just to make sure			0
‘ the lab technician came rushing out of her room as i was leaving mine and we almost smacked right into each other , then she held out her hands and there was my test with two little lines			0
' i was shocked ! @entity14 and i were thrilled - we were on cloud nine ! ’ @entity79 : in the @entity79 , the fertility treatment available to couples on the @entity82 depends on what their individual primary care trust offers			1
this varies across the @entity79 and waiting lists can be very long			0
in general , women under 40 are entitled to three cycles of @entity90 on the @entity82 if they have been trying to get pregnant for at least two years or if they have failed to conceive following 12 cycles of artificial insemination			1
in some cases , women between the ages of 40 and 42 are also offered one cycle of @entity90			1
some couples choose to go private to avoid the long @entity82 waiting times , or to have more cycles than the @entity82 offers			1
one cycle of @entity90 carried out privately costs about £ 3,500.u.s : in the @entity9 some states offer @entity90 paid for by insurance , but many do not			2
for couples whose insurance does not cover @entity90 , there are a few grants available			2
but , the only option for many couples is to pay for it themselves and this can cost thousands of dollars			0
but tragically , two days later , she discovered it was an ectopic pregnancy which was developing in one of her fallopian tubes			0
mrs @entity15 had to have surgery to end the pregnancy and to remove the fallopian tube			2
determined not to give up , in 2012 the couple started @entity90 treatment			2
they were devastated when they were told not a single embryo had survived during any of their three cycles of treatment			0
the only option they had left was to try and conceive using a donor egg - an expensive process they could n't afford			1
it was for this reason that they turned to crowdfunding through the website @entity61 mrs @entity15 said : ‘ although we experienced so much loss , we are still extremely hopeful that we can still become parents			2
‘ this entire experience has been an emotional and financial burden on us , but @entity14 and i remain a strong couple determined to conquer these obstacles together			2
she added : ‘ we continue to pray and have faith that we were meant to have a child to love and help grow			0
’ amazingly , in april , just four months after they started fundraising , the couple reached their $ 6,000 target - and are now waiting to be matched with a donor			1
mrs @entity15 told @entity149 : ‘ it was difficult at first , because i know the baby wo n’t have any of my features , but we ’re okay with that now			1
’ she added : ‘ everyone ’s donated so much money to be able to do this and there ’s always that fear in the back of our heads			0
‘ what if this does n’t work ? all these people donated for this happy ending and what if we do n’t get one ? ’			0

@entity14 and @entity15 , from @entity17 , raised the money within just four months
have been trying for a baby for eight years and three cycles of @entity90 failed
their last *chance* is to use an egg donor but they were unable to afford it
having raised the money , they are now waiting to be matched with a donor
