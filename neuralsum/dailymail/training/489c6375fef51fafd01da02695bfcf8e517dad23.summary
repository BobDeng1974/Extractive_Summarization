@entity15 officials have told the firms their planned mega defence merger must include safeguards for the @entity8 nuclear submarines , which are made by @entity3 at its @entity19 plant in @entity20			1
the deal would create a rival to @entity24 ’s @entity23 and the merged company would have combined sales of £ 60billion and a global workforce of 220,000			1
ministers are understood to have drawn up a series of ‘ red line ’ issues involving national security , any of which could derail the deal if agreement can not be reached			0
@entity9 has a ‘ golden share ’ in @entity3 , which the government can use to block any takeover if politicians fear it wo n’t be in the national interest			1
@entity41 , chairman of the commons business select committee , said he was ‘ quite prepared ’ to lead an investigation into the deal			0
mr @entity41 , @entity44 mp for @entity45 , said : ‘ there are issues about protecting @entity9 industry and employment			0
‘ there is concern that management and commercial decisions would be taken at the @entity55 level rather than @entity9 level			0
’ @entity4 , whose subsidiaries include @entity59 , has been troubled by continual interference from the @entity62 and @entity63 governments , which are large shareholders			1
dismantling the company ’s structure so this would not happen with a combined group is key to the deal winning approval here			0
veteran @entity73 commentator @entity72 , from spread betting firm @entity70 said : ‘ the @entity9 government is clearly very concerned about the safety of @entity8 as a result of any merger between @entity4 and @entity3			1
this possible merger will remain a minefield of political and commercial concerns			0
’ it is thought a separate defence unit based in @entity84 and headed by @entity3 chief executive @entity85 is being planned			2
the enlarged group is likely to be headed by @entity4 boss @entity87 , a former @entity63 paratrooper			2
@entity88 : both @entity3 and @entity4 have to win round the governments of @entity9 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity90 and the @entity24 professor @entity91 , head of research at the @entity93 , said the new company would struggle to stand up to its largest shareholders			1
‘ the history of @entity4 has been a struggle to keep the @entity63 and @entity62 governments from telling @entity59 what to do , ’ he said			1
@entity3 has focused recent expansion on the key @entity24 defence market			0
professor @entity91 added : ‘ the other issue is what the @entity24 will think about the deal			0
they do not want anything like the @entity62 engaging in the secrets of the @entity24 defence business			0
‘ even ring - fencing the defence unit under @entity85 and based in the @entity9 may not be enough			0
in my experience governments look at the top line of who owns the company			0
’ last week @entity114 , an analyst at broker @entity115 , urged @entity3 investors to sell their shares , citing the complexities of the deal and the ‘ politically - sensitive issues ’ involved			2
last line of defence : one of @entity9 's @entity8 nuclear submarines @entity123 veto : @entity9 has a ' golden share ' in @entity3 , which the government can use to block any takeover if politicians fear it wo n't be in the national interest but the combination would see defence - focused @entity3 gain access to @entity4 ’ commercial aviation business , dominated by @entity59			1
@entity4 hopes the merger will help it win more @entity24 defence work			2
inevitably any deal of this size will see some duplication , with job losses a likely @entity141 more than 20 mps with @entity3 factories in their constituencies will attend an emergency meeting at @entity143 to decide on a course of action			0
the crisis talks were organised by @entity147 , @entity44 mp for @entity148 and @entity149 , who represents many workers employed by @entity3 at its @entity152 base in @entity153			1
he called the deal ‘ a takeover ’ and warned it would lead to job cuts and would upset the @entity9 ’s defence relationship with the @entity24			2
‘ what i do n’t want to see is the @entity62 sweeping in and saying we will just get rid of the @entity9 workforce , ’ he said .			1
