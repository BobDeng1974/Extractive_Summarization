by @entity0 @entity1 packed his bags and headed for @entity3 again , leaving his troubled wife alone on @entity5 ! @entity1 returned to @entity6 saturday afternoon to film his number one @entity3 show , @entity7 , after it was picked up for another season			1
but sources say , no one works on sunday and @entity1 certainly could have spent at least part of the holiday with the mother of his four children			0
‘ @entity18 and @entity1 ’s relationship has been so bad , that you would think he would have done his best to spend at least part of the day with @entity18 , ’ says a source			1
‘ but for some reason he felt he had to fly into the @entity3 on saturday , leaving @entity18 on her own for @entity5			2
’ do n't leave us : @entity1 lleft @entity18 and their four kids behind and flew off to @entity6 on may 9			1
@entity6 was the city where he cheated on his sad wife to add salt to the wound , @entity18 ’s mom @entity26 was also out of town promoting her new book , @entity31 , so the 40 year old actress could n’t even share a @entity5 meal with her mom			1
‘ at a time when @entity18 should have been surrounded by people who love her , she was alone with the kids , waiting on them and seeing to their every need , ’ says the source			0
‘ my heart goes out to her			0
’ the source confides that the last thing @entity18 and @entity1 need right now is for him to leave town			1
and to make matters worse … the job is going to require him to be away for six to eight weeks ! in the episode of @entity18 that aired last night , the couple hotly debated his return to @entity3 to film the show 's second season			2
but @entity52 learned exclusively that his leaving was a fait accomplis			0
@entity1 47 , hosts the show , @entity7 , which is the @entity3 version of @entity59 ’s @entity58 series , and the network is thrilled with the ratings			1
but the timing is terrible for him to return to work , right in the middle of he and @entity18 trying to put the pieces of their marriage back together			0
working girl : @entity18 has a lot on her mind as she makes her way to the studio today			0
she ca n't join @entity1 in @entity6 because the two older kids are in school and she 's working on her new tv series ‘ @entity18 and @entity1 have been pulling out all the stops in an effort to save their marriage , ’ says the source			1
‘ they desperately want to stay together for the sake of their four children , @entity85 , 7 , @entity86 who turns 6 in june , @entity88 , 2 ½ and 1 ½ year old @entity89			0
@entity18 wants nothing more than for things to go back to the way they were before @entity1 cheated last december , but no matter how much counseling they go through – as seen on their reality show @entity18 – things do n’t seem to be getting better			1
‘ @entity1 is adamant about the fact he strayed because he was n’t getting enough attention at home , but @entity18 calls that ‘ unfair , ’ saying that for half their marriage she was pregnant , carrying his kids ! ‘ @entity18 and @entity1 just celebrated their 8th anniversary , ’ says a source			2
‘ and she has been pregnant for four out of eight of those years			0
so to criticize her for not being into sex enough for his tastes is just plain cruel			0
chop chop : @entity1 hosts the show , @entity7 and the network is thrilled with the ratings not only was she pregnant all that time , she ’s been taking care of back to back babies practically since the day they walked down the aisle			1
and she suffers excruciating pain due to recently diagnosed spinal disc problems			0
‘ and caring for her family is not her only job , ’ adds the source			0
‘ she ’s also busy pitching ideas for projects , filming her shows , and taking care of responsibilities like doctor and dentist appointments for the children			0
’ the source says what makes @entity1 ’s departure even worse is he ’s returning to @entity6 – the scene of his cheating ! and @entity18 ca n’t join him because the two older kids are in school and she ’s working on her new series with @entity146			1
‘ it was when @entity1 was in @entity6 the last time that he met another woman and ended up cheating on @entity18 , ’ says the source			1
‘ and of course she ’s worried that once he ’s away again , the same thing could happen			1
especially since things are a lot worse now than they ever were before he cheated			2
on her own : @entity18 is left holding the fort with her kids in @entity158			2
she may be alone when daughter @entity86 has to have her tonsils out in the next couple weeks ‘ @entity18 always says she did n’t understand his decision to cheat because the weekend before he betrayed her , they ’d spent most of the weekend having great sex			1
so you ca n’t blame her for being worried			0
‘ this also means @entity18 might be in @entity158 alone when their daughter @entity86 has to have her tonsils out in the next couple weeks			1
unless @entity1 can convince the show ’s producers to let him have a couple days off to go home and be there for his little girl			2
’ ‘ @entity1 is also concerned that by leaving , it ’s going to delay them finding a way to work through things , ’ says the source			2
‘ he even thought about backing out of his commitments all together			0
but he is under contract and the show ’s popularity has boosted his popularity too , not to mention the fact he took a pay hike this new season , and he and @entity18 are trying desperately to straighten out their finances			0

@entity1 left the family the day before @entity5 even though there was no filming for his tv show @entity7 on the weekend
@entity18 is left caring for their four kids and @entity86 needs to have her tonsils taken out in the next few weeks
it was when he was in @entity6 that @entity1 had a fling with another woman
' she ’s worried that once he ’s away again , the same thing could happen , ' says a friend . especially since things are a lot worse now '
