the former striker , who scored six goals for @entity7 against @entity3 during his @entity9 career , believes that @entity10 should be given the job instead			1
but it does seem likely that @entity13 will be bringing in the @entity14 , who took charge of their final four games of the season , as his @entity20 : scroll down for @entity21 : @entity13 's strong personality a good fit for @entity3 help the aged : @entity1 believes that @entity2 is too old to manage @entity3 rival : @entity1 is a @entity7 legend , scoring six goals for them against @entity3 during his career ' i do n’t know if @entity2 is the right man for @entity3 , ' he told the @entity31 show			1
' he ’s had his time			0
it might sound silly , but he ’s too old			0
' you ca n’t argue with his credentials and what he ’s achieved , but @entity3 should have gone for a young , vibrant manager			1

that was one of the stumbling blocks early on			0
whoever came in would have to take him on to the staff			0
' but they should have just given the job to @entity10			2
it ’s one of the biggest jobs in football but @entity10 knows the club , he knows what ’s expected and everything about the club			2
