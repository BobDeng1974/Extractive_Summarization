by @entity0 a woman has donated a kidney to a complete stranger in order to save her sister 's life as part of a organ donation exchange			1
@entity9 stepped in to help her sibling , offering to donate her organ to a stranger ' swapping ' it to ensure her sister received a healthy organ			1
when the 45 - year - old from @entity17 in @entity18 discovered her sister @entity19 , 42 , was suffering kidney failure , she immediately offered to be a living donor			1
but tests revealed she was not a perfect match for her sibling			1
@entity9 , right , saved the life of her younger sister @entity26 , left , donating one of her kidneys to a complete stranger as part of a kidney exchange , to ensure her sibling received a healthy new organ determined to help , @entity9 agreed to take part in a kidney exchange , donating one of her organs to a complete stranger in return for a healthy kidney for her sister			1
when doctors found a healthy donor organ for @entity26 , the exchange programme dictated she could only recieve the organ if @entity9 would donate hers to someone else			1
@entity9 said : ' the whole experience was really rewarding , i would do anything for my sister - i just wish i could ’ve saved her myself but unfortunately my kidney was n’t a match			1
' i was already willing to give up my kidney to save a life so it made perfect sense to still donate it even if it was n’t to save my own sister - instead i ’ve saved the life of someone else ’s sister , mother or daughter			2
' as soon as @entity19 ’s donor was being operated on i was given the thumbs up and doctors began operating on me - like a huge domino effect			2
' while @entity9 shares the same blood group as her sister , the siblings ' tissue is not compatible , meaning @entity19 's body would reject the kidney			1
to take part in the kidney exchange the sisters submitted both their details to a central bank system , collating information on donors from across the @entity77			0
the search found two possible matches to allow @entity19 to receive her kidney			1
after suffering severe headaches in 2009 , tests revealed @entity19 , pictured in hospital having dialysis , was suffering kidney failure			1
doctors revealed her organs had shut down after being destroyed by the tonsillitis virus , which she had suffered 20 years previously @entity19 , 42 , pictured in hospital after her operation , said : ' i finally have some energy and i owe it all to my generous donor and of course my courageous big sister ' paired or pooled donation is when a living kidney donor and recipient are incompatible with each other			1
while they do not match , it is possible for them to be matched with another donor and recipient in the same situation			0
the donor kidneys can then be ' exchanged ' or ' swapped '			0
the recipient receives a kidney from a stranger and the donor gives their healthy organ to another stranger			2
when two pairs are involved in the donation chain it is known as a paired donation			0
when more than two pairs take part it is a pooled donation			0
any donor and recipient pair who are considering a living kidney donation , is eligible for the scheme			1

ms @entity9 said : ' last summer i got a call from the hospital saying there was a possible match			2
' the altruistic donor said they would donate their kidney if i was still willing to be a live donor - of course i was - anything to save my baby sister			2
' the donor stipulated that the process was to be done through paired exchange in order to create a domino effect so several people would be able to benefit			0
' after all my kidney tests came back okay me and @entity19 saw a consultant doctor to make sure i was not being forced into this operation , not getting any financial gain and to make sure i was in sound mind to go through this process			2
' we were both in the same hospital and when @entity19 ’s donor had started the procedure it was all go for me too			2
' the pain was much higher than i anticipated but it was all worth it to save my beautiful sisters life			0
' @entity19 first fell ill in january 2009 , complaining of severe headaches			2
her sister said : ' my family have always been really close and my sister is more like my best friend - we ’ve always shared everything			0
as soon as she discovered her sister was severely ill and needed a transplant , @entity9 , left , offered to donate her kidney to @entity19			1
but tests revealed the siblings were not the perfect match , meaning @entity19 's body would reject @entity9 's kidney the sisters , pictured with their brother as children , signed up to the kidney exchange			1
the process required @entity9 to donate her kidney to a stranger to enable @entity19 to receive an organ from another stranger ' @entity19 started telling me about these violent headaches she ’d been having but typical @entity19 brushed it off and said they were from playing her new @entity188 too loud			1
' i advised her to get it checked out being the worried big sister and eventually she went to see the doctor			2
' he checked her blood pressure mainly but again twice after by a machine as he could tell something was n’t right - her @entity196 was off the scale - it was so high that it was n’t giving a reading			0
' the doctor phoned for an ambulance straight away and the family rushed to be by @entity19 ’s side			0
medics later revealed @entity19 could have died at any point due to her high blood pressure			0
tests eventually revealed she was in renal failure , her kidneys shutting down			0
' i finally have some energy and i owe it all to my generous donor and of course my big courageous sister ' - @entity26 ' i remember feeling completely overwhelmed and i was absolutely heart broken when i found out , ' said @entity9			1
' she was made to change everything about her life , she had to give up work and she was given up to 20 different drugs a day			0
' it was gut - wrenching to see her in so much pain and looking more and more ill when there was nothing i could do about it			0
' just in time for christmas @entity19 ’s was struggling to function on her own so it was time for a dialysis			0
' three months later she was put onto the transplant list and me , my brother and our parents were all tested hoping we would be suitable donors			0
' my parents were both not suitable after both previously being treated for cancer			0
' our brother was her best chance but he had a successful career in the army and could be called for active service at any time			0
' i prayed to be a match but due to her unusual high level of antibodies they would just fight mine - just usual sisterly stuff			0
' @entity19 and @entity9 were then introduced to the idea of the kidney exchange , raising @entity19 's chances of receiving a healthy new organ			1
@entity19 , pictured after having her head shaved for charity , has raised more than £ 4,000 for @entity248 after undergoing her transplant operation matches were found and @entity9 was able to donate one of her kidneys to a stranger , so another stranger could save her sister			1
following their transplant operations , @entity19 was in hospital for six weeks , battling to stop her body rejecting her new organ			0
@entity19 said : ' i was finally allowed home at @entity262 and i have such a new lease for life - i finally have some energy and i owe it all to my generous donor and of course my big courageous sister			1
' i ’m now fully on the mend and have recently done some fundraising of my own to give something back and i have now raised an incredible £ 4,000 after shaving my hair off for @entity248			1
' eventually doctors discovered the cause of my kidney failure - when she i was younger i had tonsillitis and the infection had stayed in my body which eventually destroyed my kidneys over a 20 - year period			2
' both me and @entity9 are now encouraging everyone to consider the kidney exchange program and becoming a live donor as it can save someone ’s life			1
