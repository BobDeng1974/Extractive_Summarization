today is set to be the hottest day of the year with temperatures soaring to @entity3 ( @entity4 )			1
after another miserable start to the week for many , with rain , wind and even severe weather warnings in parts of the @entity11 and @entity12 , the warmer weather will come as a welcome relief			2
let 's get a sun tan : two music fans dress for the sun in hot pants and small tops at the @entity20 in @entity21 , but not forgetting the wellies just in case there 's a downpour here come the girls : a group of friends carrying rucksacks stride through the fields in @entity21 yesterday as they get ready for a weekend of summer fun at the v festival taking it slow : people make the most of the warm weather yesterday with a punt down the river in @entity39 sadly , though , it is not set to last – because rain and thunderstorms are due to return next week			1
temperatures in some parts of the country over the weekend will be up to six degrees higher than in @entity46			1

quick - thinking @entity220 was able to take a photograph of the incredible sight on his @entity248			0
in his picture , the shark ’s distinctive nose and open jaws are apparent , along with a darker , circular patch representing an eye			0
