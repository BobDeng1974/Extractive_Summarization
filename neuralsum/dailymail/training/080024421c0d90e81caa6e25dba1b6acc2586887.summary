as i sat in the audience at the award ceremony , my heart was thumping and my palms were moist with anticipation			2
i was about to find out if all my hard work had paid off			2
moments later , when the name of the winner was announced , i felt that familiar surge of elation			2
yet it was not me getting up to accept the prize for the @entity14 science project			2
it was my seven - year - old daughter , @entity16			1
but it was me who had stood over her to make sure it was up to scratch			2
now , as @entity16 accepted her book token from the head teacher , it was all so familiar			1
after all , this was how it had been for me			2
i had won my first prize for @entity27 when i was around the same age , and after that i was hooked , landing one every single year until i left school			2
now , it looked as though @entity16 was following in my footsteps - or so i thought			1
but when i found her after the ceremony , my daughter was in floods of tears , wanting to hand back her prize			1
she was unable to explain why , other than to say she hated all the fuss			2
it had never been my intention to pressurise my child			2
as a high - flyer who had done well at school , i 'd expected her to work as hard as i had done			2
there was one key difference			2
as a child , i was left to my own devices by my parents			2
these days , schooling is so much more competitive that i felt i had to intervene to make sure @entity16 did her best			1
but that success came at a personal cost			2
instead of letting @entity16 have playtime , our time together became an endless round of workbooks			1
i could n't even bake cakes with her without wanting to teach her about weighing and measuring			2
however , though i was driven from a young age , my daughter simply was n't			1
innately modest , @entity16 did n't want to excel at everything			1
the pressure to do so meant she did n't want to try at all			1
worse , she started to see me less as a mother and more as a ring - master			2
she stopped looking me in the eye and became irritable and secretive about school			2
for someone like me , who generally did twice as much as the teacher asked , it was frustrating to see her trying to get away with doing next to nothing			0
i wanted to give her the benefit of my experience , but @entity16 heard my suggestions only as criticisms			1
it was not that i wanted to be pushy , although it may have looked like it from the outside as i forked out for @entity99 maths courses and £ 75 - an - hour tutors			1
all work and no play : homework became a flashpoint for @entity33 and her daughter and they had no fun together ( posed by models ) when none of that worked , in desperation i consulted a parenting counsellor , thinking she would meet @entity16 and get to the bottom of it for me			1
but after listening to me on the phone , she said it was n't my daughter she needed to see			1
at her office the following week , she diagnosed the problem			0
' you seem very stressed ' , she told me			0
' do you think that might be the cause of some of @entity16 's resistance ? ' i could only agree			1
although i worked from home as a writer , to be with @entity16 and her younger sister , @entity127 , i was still competing in the pressurised media industry and had to work round the clock			1
the most stressful time coincided with the period between school pick - up and bedtime			0
just as i was trying to defuse @entity16 's tantrums over homework , i was getting calls that could n't wait from editors			1
no wonder the tension levels at home were rising			0
i even wrote a book called how to be an @entity142 - when you just do n't have the @entity143			1
and while it contained lots of practical tips , like how to put together a school lunch - box in less than a minute , looking back i can see it was also a @entity149			1
all the time - saving tricks in the world could n't stem the constant feeling that my brain was about to burst			1
yet still my workaholic tendencies and need for success , kept driving me			0
in the space of a single year , when @entity127 was four and @entity16 seven , i published no fewer than three books			1
to keep up , i started viewing breaks as a chance to catch up on work , rather than immerse myself in my family			0
but in my drive to provide materially for my girls , i was missing the fact that it was not just me who was paying the price for my career			0
my daughters were , too			0
too much , too soon : many young children are feeling stressed out thanks to their pushy parents now i 'd had my eyes opened to the effect my work was having on my children , i started to look at life through their eyes			1
i imagined how frightening it must be for a child , who relies on its parents for everything , to see their care - givers so overwhelmed			0
it was painful to admit that doing what i thought was best for my girls was harming them			0
indeed , animal and human studies find that when parents are stressed , their offspring are stressed , too			0
baby rats , for example , are more fearful if their mothers are too busy to lick them and calm them down			0
in humans , babies who sense their mothers ' anxiety feel more pain from injections , studies have found			0
nor does our shortage of time make the periods we do have with our children more special			0
one analysis found that when parents try to make up for lost time , they 're more bossy and intense			0
no wonder children 's charity @entity213 estimates nearly one million children aged five to 15 have mental health problems such as anxiety			1
the bleak truth , is that no matter how good our intentions , stress and overwork make us poor parents			0
counsellor @entity222 , author of @entity223 : how parental stress is toxic to kids , wanted to get to the bottom of why affluent , well - educated people , who followed parenting guidebooks to the letter - and showered their children with love - were not necessarily producing emotionally healthy children			0
he had assumed that when kids developed behavioural problems , it was these problems that made the family tense			0
on closer inspection , he discovered a family was often tense before the child developed an emotional issue			0
@entity243 believes the most important thing we can provide for our children is a calm environment			0
but in order to get off the carousel of being constantly busy , i had to understand the reasons i became a workaholic			0
i started to wonder why whatever professional heights i reached , nothing was ever enough			0
when i looked back on my past , i realised that the top marks i 'd got at school had just been distractions from the misery that followed my parents ' bitter divorce			1
i was thankful @entity16 did not have that void to fill			1
she 's lucky to have a secure childhood under the protection of two parents who always try to put her needs first			1
but unless i found a better balance , i realised i was creating more problems			0
children of workaholics tend either to copy them - or are so scared off by seeing what it does to their parents they do n't even want to try			0
sitting back : now @entity33 has learnt to not to push her daughter to follow in her footsteps as a writer so i had to change			1
when @entity16 moved to secondary school , we sent her to an excellent state academy instead of continuing with private education , reducing the financial pressure on our family and allowing me to work less			1
i took steps to lighten up our relationship , have more fun and spend more time together in which we did nothing very much			1
i tried a technique called @entity287 , devised by the psychologist @entity288 , to reset the emotional temperature between us			0
it involved spending time alone with @entity16 , and offering her unlimited love in order to re-establish trust between us			1
@entity297 parents spend £ 6 billion a year on private tuition for their children the idea is that by freeing her from being constantly controlled , it would take us back to the closeness we had before resentment set in			1
it involved going away for the weekend with @entity16 and letting her decide what we did			1
of course , it sounds mad to give a child total freedom , because parents are taught that in order to make children behave , we have to give them more rules , not fewer			0
but it 's only for a short space of time , and @entity16 made perfectly reasonable requests			1
last year , she decided on a weekend at a hotel in @entity318			0
she wanted to walk on the pier , and eat candy floss and fish and chips on the beach			0
later , she wanted to stay up late and cuddle up with me in our hotel room while we watched two of her favourite movies			0
i left my laptop at home and turned my mobile off - and it was quite simply the best weekend ever			0
the impact of our time away was immediate and dramatic			0
it was as if the wall that had gone up between us had been dismantled and we could see one other again			0
since i stopped pushing her , @entity16 's motivation has come back and , now 12 , she is succeeding in her own way - by playing the violin - not in mine			1
for all those prizes i won in the past , i realise there is no award that comes close to the elation of being the mother of a happy child			0

@entity33 was a @entity348 ; she put her daughter under too much pressure to succeed
@entity352 feeling *unhappy* and their relationship was strained
now she 's learnt to be more laid back ; as a result , @entity16 is excelling
@entity33 's new book is @entity359 : how to @entity361 's @entity362 is published on *september* 18 by @entity363 , £ 8.99 .
