it ’s every parent ’s nightmare – being separated from their child in a busy street or shop , with no way of contacting them			2
but now there ’s a device that young children can wear that lets them call their parents at the touch of a button			1
children over the age of four can call a pre-programmed number by pressing the only large button on the device , which comes in pink and blue			0
they can receive calls from up to three numbers in the same way and talk into the speaker which is built into a durable rubber band			1
@entity16 says the smartband is ‘ built to withstand the playground ’s most ambitious set of monkey bars			1
’ the device can play fun sound effects and also read out the time for children			0
parents with @entity60 phones can receive their child ’s anticipated location information automatically at pre-scheduled times by using a feature called ‘ @entity65 ’ so they know if their child is where they should be at different points in the day - for example , when walking home from school ( illustrated with a stock image ) the wearable has one large button that can be pressed by children to make and receive calls			1
they talk into a concealed microphone			0
the device is designed to be worn by children over the age of four and has launched in the @entity36			1
it claims to be tough enough to be worn while playing sports or in the playground			0
children can make a call to one pre-programmed number by pressing the button			0
all a child has to do is press a button to answer a call , followed by speaking into @entity15 and listening through its speaker			2
the wearable works to an app designed to be used on an adult ’s smartphone			1
it lets them check their child ’s location using @entity100 , which is built into the band			0
it links with an app for iphones and @entity60 handsets that can be downloaded onto parents ’ smartphones , allowing them to set up the wearable and use @entity100 to track their child ’s location at all times			2
parents with @entity60 phones can receive their child ’s anticipated location information automatically at pre-scheduled times by using a feature called ‘ @entity65 ’ so they know if their child is where they should be at different points in the day			2
‘ for example , if you know your child normally gets home from school at 3:15pm you can set a reminder for that time and get a notification on your phone so you can check whether your child gets home on time , ’ the company says			0
despite its simplicity , the @entity15 costs $ 80 ( £ 51 ) and requires a @entity134 contract to work which will cost $ 5 ( £ 3 ) a month			1
