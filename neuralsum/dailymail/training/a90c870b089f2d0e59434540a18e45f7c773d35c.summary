by @entity0 like many teen boys in @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity1 had hoop dreams			1
the gregarious 16 - year - old ' once signed a basketball with his name and he gave it to his mom , ' @entity1 ’s friend , @entity6 , 18 , tells @entity11 in an exclusive interview			1
' he told her , " you keep this because someday i ’m going to be famous			0
' " on december 27 , 2013 , @entity1 got his wish — but for all the wrong reasons			2
instead it captured the moments before a horrific explosion			0
a bomb planted in the gold suv on the top left of the photo killed his best friend @entity30 ( wearing a red hoodie ) @entity33 dreams : @entity1 , with his mother @entity34 at left , had hopes of becoming an @entity38 star			1
before he was killed , he gave her a signed basketball and told her ' you keep this because some day i 'm going to be famous ' early that bright friday morning , @entity6 and @entity44 , 17 , picked up @entity1 and 18 - year old @entity45			1
the four were on break from school and looking for a way to spend the day			0
' we decided to go grab a cup of coffee and have a jog afterward , ' says @entity6 of their plan			2
the group drove to an upscale section of downtown @entity3 to get their coffees before heading to a nearby plaza filled with fountains and outdoor seating in the shadow of the @entity63 building , a @entity65 - designed complex refurbished after the 15 - year @entity4 civil war ended in 1990			1
' @entity1 was talking about his family , about his brother and his mom , ' says @entity6			1
' we were reminiscing about the time before his little brother came into this world and how afterwards everything changed			0
' deadly attack : @entity75 men place @entity1 on a stretcher following the car bomb explosion that rocked central @entity3 on december 27 , 2013			1
the huge explosion also killed @entity79 , former finance minister their serious conversation turned light when @entity6 took out his phone			2
he wanted to record their day with a selfie and post the image to @entity87 , a popular mobile app that broadcasts pictures to friends			2
' the guys always take selfies , so this time i decided i would take one , ' says @entity6			1
the photo captured the looks of quiet amusement on his buddies ’ faces — bekdash closest to the camera on the right and the usually active @entity1 sitting uncharacteristically still in a red sweatshirt between @entity102 and @entity44			1
only later would anyone notice the significance of the golden suv tucked in the upper - left side of the frame			2
it was forgettable background scenery in an innocuous selfie focused on friends just hanging out			1
it was also a ticking time bomb , which officials estimate was packed with 50 to 60 kilograms of explosives			0
moments after @entity117 uploaded his photo , the shock of a huge blast knocked the phone from his hand and all four boys toppled as fragments of glass and other shrapnel hurled in every direction			1
heartbroken : @entity1 's parents and his two brothers are devastated over the the brutal death and loss			0
' may ur soul rest in peace our @entity134 , ' his mother @entity34 wrote on his @entity137 page ' it took a few seconds to realize that it was an explosion because we saw ash and smoke and shrapnel flying everywhere , ' @entity6 says of the initial blast , which he notes sounded like fireworks and felt like being shoved and hit over the head			1
' as soon as i fell on the ground , i bounced back up to my feet and started running immediately , ' recalls @entity6			0
when he got far enough away from the blast site , @entity6 stopped			1
only then did he become aware of the bits of glass speckling his leg , leaving him in excruciating pain			0
' i wanted to go back but i could n’t walk , so i sat on a curb , ' he explains			0
' i could n’t find anyone			0
i just saw black smoke everywhere			0
' big brother : @entity1 and his siblings were very close			1
he was talking about his family in those fateful moments before the car bomb ended his life @entity6 finally spotted @entity44 running towards him , panicked and crying			1
' he was yelling that @entity1 is dead and he ’s on the ground with blood around him , ' he says			0
an ambulance rushed @entity117 and @entity102 to the @entity167 while @entity44 went to the home of nearby relatives , since he was n’t as badly injured			0
@entity6 , who required stitches to his leg , face and head , had no idea what to tell @entity1 's parents after they arrived to the hospital , begging to know if their child was alive			1
' i tried to keep my hopes up and convince myself that he was going to be okay , and that i was going to see him again as soon as he got well , ” says @entity6			0
“ deep down i knew there was no hope of him coming back to us			0
' zest for life : @entity1 was an athletic teen who was n't shy about hugigng his friends and telling them how special they were			2
' i tried to keep my hopes up and convince myself that he was going to be okay , and that i was going to see him again as soon as he got well , ' says @entity6 he was right			0
two days later @entity1 became the seventh person to die in the blast that reportedly targeted — and killed — @entity189 , a former finance minister			2
@entity79 , 62 , was an important adviser to @entity190 , leader of the main @entity193 party , the @entity192 , as well as a vocal critic of another of @entity4 ’s powerful parties , the @entity198 - backed militia , @entity199			2
today the three surviving friends do n’t exhibit many physical scars from their horrific experience , but the emotional trauma they suffered in the blast is still bubbling beneath the surface			0
' i ca n’t stand to look at the picture because i cringe and i get flashbacks , ' says @entity6 of the selfie he took that december morning			2
and , like @entity1 before he died , @entity6 understands his future is n’t in this tiny @entity212 country that 's struggling to deal with the internal strife and side - effects from the ongoing conflicts in neighboring @entity216			1
rest in peace : a portrait of 16 - year - old @entity1 is seen during a candle - light vigil at the site of a car bomb that killed the teen with so much talent ' even before the explosion , i knew that the situation would never ever get better , ' he explains , ' and every one of us [ who was ] there at the explosion dreams to get out of here and have a family outside of @entity4			1
we know that there are a lot of confrontations between two political parties and people like @entity1 have to pay for it every time			2
' now @entity6 just wants people to remember that his friend @entity1 , an athletic teen who was n’t shy about hugging friends and telling them how special they were , deserves to be celebrated for who he was — instead of what happened to him			1
' it ’s sad that he got famous from his death and not from his achievements , ' says @entity6			0
' i ’m really convinced that if he had lived on he would have achieved huge results from the things he would have done			0
' and the @entity1 family can only imagine whether or not their boy could have realized his dream of becoming a renowned @entity38 star			1
' his mom is heartbroken because she has been looking everywhere for that ball he signed , and she ca n’t find it , ' says @entity6			0
' but she wo n’t stop searching			0
