the accused boy , who has been unnamed because of his age , was acquitted today in @entity7 , @entity8 , on charges of assault causing bodily harm and robbery			1
police had alleged the suspect slammed @entity16 's face and teeth into the sidewalk while stealing his iphone in @entity20 in november of 2010			2
@entity27 could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused boy - who was sent to another school following the attack - was the one who had attacked @entity16 that day			1
@entity16 had produced oral and written statements identifying his attacker prior to his death , but how reliable they were was under question			1
' the case law on eyewitness evidence consistently states that even when an eyewitness is honest and credible , as i ’m sure @entity16 would have been , these witnesses are often mistaken because of how the brain functions , ' justice @entity40 told the court monday , according to the @entity43			2
bullied : @entity16 suffered from muscular dystrophy provoking attacks from local bullies who made him fearful to go to school or take the walks encouraged regularly by his doctor to get better ' i hope that one day , the youths responsible for these crimes will have the courage to come forward and take responsibility for their wrongdoing , ' she said as part of her final statement before the room			1
outside the courthouse , @entity16 's family expressed their disappointment in the verdict			2
' the law is the law , ' said @entity64 , the boy 's father to the @entity43			1
' i know @entity16 was 100 per cent sure in his mind			0
i like to think that is the truth			0
' evidence : written and oral testimony by @entity16 prior to his suicide was found not reliable enough by the court though the boy 's father @entity64 says he is keeping his son 's side of the story as the truth @entity16 's grandmother @entity79 had earlier said that his family ' do n't want to be a lynch squad ' and are only trying to help the attacker have a better life			1
' he 's a child , just like @entity16 , ' family friend @entity84 told the @entity85 monday			0
@entity86 had hoped , however , that through a guilty verdict the accused teen would have received some help or community service , making him more understanding of those with disabilities			2
his father had said that it was because of his son 's disability , diagnosed a year ago and three years after his mother 's death from cancer , that led to his bulling at school			0
disappointment : family of @entity16 expressed disappointment after the verdict today while his grandmother @entity79 earlier said they ' do n't want to be a lynch squad ' but hope the alleged attacker is helped for a better life conclusion : concluding the trial , the court 's judge said she hopes one day the boy 's attackers will one day come forward and take responsibility for their crime realizing his inabilities to defend himself against his attacker , his father says the boy once apologized to him in embarrassment			1
' he realized how weak he really was and how he was unable to defend himself			0
being a young man , he was a very proud kid and the fact he could n’t defend himself in that situation hurt his self - esteem , irreparably , ' mr @entity16 said			0
doctors had told @entity16 his muscular dystrophy could be helped by walking outside , but he was scared of doing this after the attack			0
