despite a grand total of 88 years on the planet , sir @entity0 is showing no desire to slow down			1
ever passionate and curious about the natural world , it seems there 's always more to explore			2
' i 'm moving much slower than i used to , ' the 88 - year - old admits , with a smile , speaking exclusively to @entity10 , ' but i 've still got a lot to give , and 2015 is as big a year as i can remember			1
' as 2015 begins , @entity0 is , at first , in reflective mood			1
the last 12 months have seen him wrap up the @entity14 's landmark series , @entity15 , which engaged the nation in a storytelling version of relationships in the wild			1
here he holds a tiny midwife toad , native to @entity26 and northwestern @entity27 , in the palm of his hand he 's also shot specials for the @entity14 – @entity32 's @entity31 and @entity32 's @entity33 – attracting new audiences by embracing 3d technology			1
the documentaries mark the latest contribution in a six - decade career that taken him from the @entity40 to the depths of the rainforest and beyond			1
it was in 1954 , as @entity45 controller filling in on @entity46 , that he stepped onto his first international flight , acting as no more than a stand - in for regular presenter @entity50			1
and the rest , as they say , is history			2
this year has started with a flutter of press engagements			1
he has the promotion for two new series , associated dvd releases , charity and ambassadorial commitments , not to mention the sketching out of research plans and narratives for the next burst of natural world programming at the end of 2015			1
sir @entity0 started presenting in 1954 as a stand - in for the regular presenter of @entity46			1
this image was taken in the @entity72 , while he was promoting the 2014 3d film @entity73 the nature enthusiast is currently filming a series about dinosaurs and fossils in @entity78 , @entity79			1
he is posing with the fossil of an invertebrate ammonite , which would have lived 240 - 65 million years ago but @entity0 explains that when you get to his age , you 're inclined to turn away from any drawn - out plans			1
' you simply take it day by day , ' he admits			2
' right now , we 've got a series in @entity78 that is taking up much of my attention			1
' that will keep me going until the summer			2
it 's all about dinosaurs and fossils – that 's subject matter you can research until you go mad , should you wish to			1
' for me it 's about enjoying each challenge			2
i love being busy and love feeling as though i 've still got a part to play			2
i 'd never want to stand in the way of someone else coming in and suggesting they take on a few of these projects if they think they can do them better			2
' but i keep getting asked to do them , so how would i ever turn such opportunities down ? i love the excitement that travel provides – every trip feels like a new adventure … i think that 's why we all love travel			2
' @entity0 is in good shape for his age			1
his health is the end result of a professional career spent in the great outdoors			1
he 's challenged himself physically over the years – no more so than recently after undergoing heart and knee surgery – yet still comes across as largely invincible			2
but it turns out he 's as flappable as the rest of us			2
' i 'm terrified of so many things			0
i 'm more likely to get vertigo than in my teens when i was a very enthusiastic and silly rock climber			1
' @entity0 loves being busy and hates to turn down an opportunity to go on another adventure , but he is concerned that human population growth is having a detrimental effect on animal species you 'd think imbalance and a fear of heights is illogical for a man who has clambered his fair share of mountains			1
he agrees : ' i ought to be used to it , but when you 're hanging 300ft up for an hour or so it 's nice to come down			0
' sir @entity0 gets to see the majesty of the natural world from dizzying heights , but also takes a microscopic look at intricate ecosystems and their inhabitants			1
in his years , he 's seen species decline and come back , ecosystems rejuvenate and destroy themselves , opening up viewers ' awareness to conservation issues they never knew existed			1
through all this , his views on climate change have solidified			0
' the facts are indisputable that the climate is changing , ' he says once again			0
' and human beings are the cause of it ? of course			0
it is an undisputable fact			0
population growth is detrimental to the planet			0
' having just come back from the @entity167 , in that place there exists the perfect example of the damage			2
all the statistics are there			0
the temperature of the sea is changing , as is its acidity			0
' you can see the sea grass visibly changing and the coral are unable to live in these higher temperatures			0
they wo n't be able to form coral limestone anymore			0
you do n't need to be a genius to see that			0
' in his career @entity0 has seen ecosystems rise and fall , and animal species decline then resurface			1
in his @entity189 series , @entity0 looked at the platypus , which was discovered in the 19th century just before @entity191 published his theory of evolution by @entity194 as well as looking at ecosystems from great heights , sir @entity0 has always enjoyed taking a close - up look at their inhabitants			1
why certain species have the patterns they do has intrigued him for years , and in @entity189 he looks into the similarities between the striped markings of the zebra and the morpho butterfly sir @entity0 predicts that this year travellers will start to appreciate places they find closer to home one : we 'll keep on travelling , but we 're beginning to appreciate places closer to home that perhaps we may have ignored 10 years ago			1
two : eco-tourism is set for a big year			2
despite conservation challenges there is clearly a growing trend towards green travel experiences			0
three : technology is going to take travel to another level			0
my fear though is we 're so obsessed with tour guide apps we actually miss what 's in front of us ! four : if operator margins are being squeezed , the travel experience is in danger of becoming a sales operation			0
if you are on safari , you should be allowed to be on safari , not sold to at every turn			0
five : people will continue to want to explore more off the beaten track			0
i 'm not sure if that 's a good or bad thing for our wildlife , to be honest			0
and on dry land the challenges come just as frequently			0
' my job always come back to the animals - i go where they are , not where they are n't			1
' but even there the situation is changing			0
i went to see the deforestation in @entity252 recently and , honestly , it hit me hard			0
' because of the need for grazing and land required for the production of palm oil , the natural landscape is being ripped apart			0
and all this demand is coming from the needs of the global population			0
' so if mankind 's degradation of rainforest environments continues despite huge campaigns of awareness over the past generation , what is the answer ? ' the only way we can implement any change to the damage caused to the natural world is by controlling the continued explosion of the human population , ' says the broadcaster			0
' the @entity280 population has benefited from their ' one child ' policy - they would be in even greater trouble than they are at the moment if they had n't been doing that for the past 20 years			2
' but the answer is much greater than that , and actually , the right to have children is a fundamental right as a human being			0
' the reality is , if we can not control our yearning to reproduce , eco-tourism might be the only answer we have left in trying to , even partially , arrest this slump in green thinking			0
' there are some fantastic initiatives in this area – @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , and even in the @entity307 with some awe - inspiring walking holidays in @entity309 and @entity310			2
' people need n't think eco-tourism means travelling to far - off lands or protecting obscure species we 've never previously heard of			1
' the reality is protecting the environment can begin from the moment we leave the house			0
' see @entity0 's @entity189 , new and exclusive to watch , on mondays at 9pm , from 2nd february .			1
