@entity1 special : what it was like to be invincible when @entity4 were invincible - a recollection of an unbeatable team it 's 10 years since @entity4 's spectacular unbeaten 49 matches in the @entity9 came to a close and when @entity10 , who was at the top of his game for over 25 years , took charge of high profile fixtures across the globe			1
having seen many of the world 's finest players in action , former referee @entity10 was lucky enough to officiate during the era when @entity21 guided the @entity4 ' @entity22 '			1
here 's his take on members of that record breaking run ... @entity10 referees a fiesty clash between @entity4 and @entity27 during the ' @entity22 ' era having refereed six of ' @entity22 ' 49 - match unbeaten run , including the last one they won , i got to know how close the team worked and it was that incredible team spirit and total belief in one another that enabled their fine run			1
@entity40 , having a word with keeper @entity39 , knew the opposition would play on the @entity43 's temperament @entity39 whenever you refereed @entity4 against @entity45 you knew it would be a battle			1
@entity48 played on the big @entity43 's fragile temperament and put @entity50 on him , literally , at set pieces			1
in december 2003 i was aware of the ill feeling between the two sides when @entity50 kept chipping away at me telling me that i should n't give @entity4 anything as he knew they did n't like me			1
fortunately i ignored his advice when pulling him up for treading on @entity39 's toes at a corner			1
penalising that kept @entity39 in the right mood			2
defender @entity63 , celebrating a goal for the @entity62 , made @entity40 doubt his own decision during a match @entity63 @entity63 was a very level headed footballer who said very little to me or any referees			1
i must have really tested this when giving a penalty against him for a foul on @entity74 late into a game @entity4 were already losing 2 - 1			1
@entity63 just looked at me astonished and shook his head			2
that had more effect on me than him screaming in my face			0
i knew i 'd got the decision wrong			0
left back @entity81 was an integral part of @entity4 's rock solid defence but was never short of a word @entity81 @entity81 was perhaps the opposite of @entity63 ; never slow to tell you how you 'd made a mistake or how bad you were			1
his comments were usually laced with abuse but issued in such a way that left you wondering if he meant to offend or was just not very bright			0
@entity94 @entity93 , celebrating for the @entity62 , was a pain to referee says @entity40 @entity93 an absolute genius on the ball but the @entity94 could be a real pain for referees			1
a couple of seasons earlier i remember calling then skipper @entity104 to me and asking him to help me shut @entity93 up			0
' just book him , we think he 's a pain as well , ' @entity104 advised me with a smile			2
@entity108 , who scored four times in @entity40 's six ' @entity22 ' games , asked the referee to call him @entity112 @entity108 a @entity114 gentleman who was polite , calm and friendly to deal with , telling me to ' call me @entity112 '			1
pires scored four times in those six games , the goal at the @entity116 was an absolute cracker			2
it was the @entity114 connection , with @entity21 's influence , which led to an embarrassing incident for me			2
in @entity125 ' first season he was down injured and i approached him to ask , ' @entity126 ? ' @entity125 replied , ' i 'm fine and @entity127 ! ' poll says @entity129 was a gifted player but was left frustrated when he missed a penalty at @entity131 @entity129 another gifted player who was never in the face of referees but disappointed me in one game when he failed to convert a penalty at @entity131			0
referees are accused of not giving penalties to away teams at @entity27 so when we do you could at least score			0
highly influential winger @entity142 knew exactly how to wind up the opposition , according to @entity40 @entity142 another gifted wide player who had the ability to get under the skin of opponents by winding them up			0
i remember sending @entity149 off when playing for @entity27 at @entity150 after being tormented by @entity142 time and again , he resorted to butting the @entity152			0
@entity153 was livid and as @entity149 approached him leaving the field demanded to know what he was supposed to have done			0
' sorry boss , he p * * * * * me off so i nutted him ' came the honest appraisal			0
@entity142 's job was done			2
@entity4 legend @entity159 ( right ) was the best centre forward to play in the @entity9 says poll @entity159 the best centre forward ever to play in the @entity9 , perhaps down to his speed of thought as much as his pace over the turf			1
i remember allowing the @entity114 to take a quick free - kick against @entity167 which went straight into the unguarded corner of the net – he saw the opportunity and asked permission which i gave him			2
two years later i made him wait for the wall to go back at @entity174 and after i blew my whistle he just lifted the all up and over the wall and bent it into the top left corner for a wonderful goal			0
nothing seemed beyond him except recognising referees ! after one defeat at @entity150 , @entity159 went absolutely ballistic trying to get to me to blame me for the defeat			0
' you cost us in the cup final and now tonight it 's enough ! ' unfortunately i never refereed @entity4 in a cup final so clearly players are guilty of mistaken identity as well as referees			1
former @entity4 captain @entity192 was part of the tunnel clash with @entity195 , which @entity40 oversaw @entity192 the hard man of the team but a real @entity200 character ; tough as nails on the pitch , considered and polite off it			1
there was of course the infamous tunnel clash with @entity195 which i oversaw which stands out but by then we had established a mutually respectful relationship			0
building that was difficult as @entity192 's combative tackling was always going to cause issues with referees and i sent him off twice , both for second yellow cards			2
some players adjusted their style when on a yellow but not @entity192			0
he knew one way and that was uncompromising and hard			0
two off field incidents spring to mind ; the day after the tunnel incident i bumped into @entity192 in the @entity222 lounge at @entity223			0
we chatted for a few minutes about the previous evening 's game and @entity192 said he felt they lost the game by winding - up @entity27 and @entity195 in particular			1
i then refereed @entity192 in a @entity229 game in @entity230 when he was at @entity231 and he took the time and trouble to pop into my dressing room after the game to thank us and tell us how much he missed @entity237 refereeing – interesting given his style of play			0
@entity4 manager @entity21 , still at the helm in north @entity241 , won his third @entity9 title in 2004 @entity21 tactically superb but temperamental			1
@entity21 often used the tactic of planting a seed of doubt in a referee 's mind at half - time when throwing a comment at you in the tunnel about what you were failing to see			1
hard as you would try you found yourself looking for that early in the second - half so the tactic worked			2
my most stark memory was after a @entity258 semi-final defeat in which i cautioned lots and dismissed @entity192 , @entity21 made it clear how disappointed he was with my officiating			0
i offered to visit him at the training ground and go through the dvd with him and the team to help them see why i had done what i had			0
he declined saying that he did n't want his team to change their approach by considering a referee 's decisions			1
his conviction was absolute and his belief unwavering then as it is now – hence why he has seen so many red cards for his players .			0

it 's the 10 - year *anniversary* of @entity4 's final win in their unbeaten run
