by @entity0 published : 15:27 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 03:04 est , 29 november 2012 violent death : @entity2 , 42 , was stabbed to death at her house			1
her son , who can not be named for legal reasons , is appearing at court , charged with her murder a 16 - year - old boy murdered his mother by stabbing her 94 times , immobilising her early on in the attack by severing her spinal cord , a court heard today			1
the teenager , who admits having ' an interest in knives ' , then claimed @entity2 had been killed at their home in @entity19 , @entity20 , by a gang of ' mystery men from @entity23 '			1
he inflicted knife wounds across her head , back and front in the two bedroom flat , stabbing her with at least one knife in an attack so sudden she had ' little chance ' to defend herself , jurors were told			1
the teenager then fled the flat in the early hours , climbing out of his first floor bedroom window and down a drainpipe			1
he went to visit friends , feeding them an elaborate cover story that he had seen a gang of ' mystery men ' from the north of @entity43 kill his mother , @entity36 heard			1
divorced mother - of - three ms @entity2 , 42 , was found slumped against the hallway wall			1
prosecutor @entity46 said the teenager claimed he had watched through a bathroom doorway as other people stabbed his mother to death			1
mr @entity46 said : ' he described to friends how he had gone into the bathroom and from there was alerted by a noise to something happening outside			0
' the implication is that men had entered the flat and were trying to kill his own mother about a foot away from him			1
' he said he watched through the ajar door of the bathroom as " they " were stabbing his mother			1
and at some stage " they " tried to knife him			2
' the youngster told friends of his ' escape ' when he met up with them shortly before 3am , mr @entity46 said			0
they did not call the police or an ambulance			0
in an earlier phone call , at around 10pm that evening , the boy had told a female friend in that group his mother would be executed and had ' days to live ' , mr @entity46 said			2
mr @entity46 said : ' his brother had got himself into some sort of trouble with a drug debt or the like			0
' the boy announced that his mum had only got a couple of days to live			0
the friend was left with the impression that his mum 's life was at immediate risk			0
' interest in knives ' : @entity36 heard the teenager turned on his mother , stabbing her in the head , back and front and then blaming mystery men from @entity23 ' mystery people somehow concerned with his brother up in @entity97 were on their way or in someway likely to kill ms @entity2			1
' tragically , the friend - who can not be named for legal reasons - could hear ms @entity2 in the background , bringing her son a drink			1
mr @entity46 added : ' was he already in some sort of murderous mindset by this point ? had he intended to take his own mother 's life and this gave him the welcome opportunity of a cover story ? ' exactly why it was that the defendant decided upon such a dreadful and genuinely tragic course of events perhaps will never be known			2
' prosecutor @entity46 ' or having spoken with a teenage bravado , did something later on trigger his temper ? ' either way , ms @entity2 was ' immobilised ' early on in an horrific killing at his hands , mr @entity46 said			2
a blade wielded by her son severed her spinal cord , a post mortem of her bloodstained body revealed			0
there were no injuries on her arms or hands , suggesting she was rendered unconscious early in the attack			0
today , the boy , now 17 , wore a silver tracksuit as he listened to his mother 's last moments being relived in court			2
mr @entity46 added : ' exactly why it was that the defendant decided upon such a dreadful and genuinely tragic course of events perhaps will never be known			0
' it may well be that during the course of that night he had become angry at something she had said or done			0
he says for himself that he has a temper and perhaps that and his interest in knives came together and he took his mother 's life			1
' mr @entity46 told the jury that the youngster should have called 999 or screamed for help , or called an ambulance , but he did nothing but leave the flat			2
he eventually went to a friend 's house with his mother 's blood on his face and on his socks , the court heard			1
in the boy 's version of events , he must have stepped over his mother 's motionless body to lock the door after her killers left			2
then he took money from her handbag , changed his trousers and left through the window			0
he told his three friends - all girls - that cuts on his hands were from scaling down the drainpipe			0
but forensics experts found traces of his blood inside the flat			2
the murder weapons have never been recovered			0
the youth , who can not be named for legal reasons , denies one charge of murder between july 19 and 21			0
