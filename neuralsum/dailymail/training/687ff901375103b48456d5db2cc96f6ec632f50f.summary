@entity0 took the fashion world by storm this year - the reality star walked in numerous shows for the @entity5 15 shows in september			1
but with the success has come heavy criticism from some parts of the industry that the 19 year old was handed her modelling career on a plate thanks to her famous family			1
the teen has been keen to defend herself against these accusations in recent weeks - last week she gave an interview arguing that her success had n't just happened magically			2
in reality i worked pretty hard for this … it was n’t like i just got it magically and it just happened			1
' now , a new article in @entity37 claims the star has formed a game plan to ensure she continues to bag high - profile contracts , like her new ad campaign for @entity42			1
@entity0 is n't the first celebrity to get modelling contracts thanks to her family ties - she comes from a long line of attractive showbiz offspring who have featured in catwalk shows and adverts			1
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 have all walked the runway for various fashion houses , as has @entity58 's granddaughter @entity56 and @entity61 's daughters @entity59 and @entity62			2
even @entity64 's son @entity63 recently featured in a campaign for @entity66			2
but @entity0 is the most prolific of all of the models so far - she is also the only one to come from a reality television family as opposed to a @entity71 or acting dynasty			1
@entity22 is a model who is signed to @entity75 agency and has walked for shows like @entity77 @entity23 model @entity22 , who is signed to @entity75 agency , has walked for shows like @entity77 and was hired as the face of @entity79 , has hit back at @entity0 's claims			1
in a open letter on @entity83 website , she argues that normal girls have had to work much harder to gain even a fraction of @entity0 's success and tries to explain the reason many normal models reacted the way they did to her sudden achievements in fashion			1
@entity22 has a blog on @entity83 website that documents her life as a model @entity22 wrote : ' @entity0 , ' take a moment and remove yourself from your current situation , if you can , to a life that is n’t riddled with excess			1
' now , imagine you ’re from a small town and / or third - world country where your only way to get out of your current social class , achieve your dreams , get a green card or just gain better work conditions is to become a high - fashion model			1
' you have to leave for six months to a year sometimes , signing contracts you can barely understand , let alone oblige to , almost without choice			2
' you ’re away from your family , your friends and everything you know			2
you live in a one - bedroom apartment with six other girls in the same situation in @entity119			0
' you have to go to tutoring and / or @entity122 lessons in between learning how to “ walk ” at the agency , attending castings every other day , going on test shoots to get you experience , trying to learn your new neighborhood , going to the gym and hoping to maybe make some money all at once			0
' oh , and your apartment and test shoots are n’t free , by the way			0
they are added to your account with the agency , as are your casting outfits and cellphone			0
' these are going to leave you in some serious debt if nobody books you for anything ; some girls owe upward of $ 30,000 ( £ 19,000 ) after a year of trying to book gigs			0
' so now let ’s pretend you actually lived through all of that , and it ’s finally @entity148			0
exciting , right ? ' this could be your big break ! you could send your family in @entity151 or @entity152 , @entity153 , the money they need for your little brothers to have new clothes or even afford a plane ticket home for the holidays ! ' imagine standing in line after line of girls with your exact height and body measurements all day , each one hoping for a coveted spot on the @entity169 runway			0
' casting after casting , and you just ca n’t seem to get your place			0
@entity0 walks the runway at @entity174 women 's fashion show during @entity175 2015 ( left ) and poses on the red carpet with her sister @entity179 last june ' but suddenly after a week full of the word “ no , ” killing yourself at the gym , exhausting yourself in classes , cutting your diet in half , not talking with your family and sleeping in a room with six equally exhausted girls , you get the call			1
' your agent texts you with an 8 a.m. fitting at @entity189			0
' @entity190 , you ’re going to walk for @entity189 ! this is a dream come true , someone finally said yes , and the prestige is beyond what you could have imagined ! ' so you pack your model bag , a bottled water , your walking shoes and agency - approved casting outfit			2
this could be your big break , assuming they do n’t cut your look last minute , a common practice done to no - name girls , so fingers crossed ! ' it ’s the morning of the show , and the subway is packed with lots of models , agents , buyers and fashion people in general , all exhausted , but ready to work			1
@entity0 is n't alone - @entity52 and @entity53 ( centre and right ) have both walked the runway for various fashion houses , as has @entity61 's daughter @entity59 ( left ) ' backstage is a commotion circus of clothes , hair , makeup , yelling , fashion tv interviews … it ’s an @entity228 overload ! ' all the big names are there , your personal heroes including @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity189 himself — the list goes on ! ' but wait , is n’t that a reality tv star over there in hair and makeup ? ' yea , that ’s definitely a @entity242 or something			1
what is she doing here ? ' did she take the subway ? was she at the casting ? what agency is she with ? i did n’t see her last season … ' does she need more fame ? more money ? a green card perhaps ? ' this girl did n’t do and does n’t owe half of what you did to get here today , that much is certain			0
' her mommy surely called a top agency , got her in the door and the design houses just chose to milk her fame like the cash cow that it is			0
@entity264 , @entity265 , @entity0 and @entity266 attend @entity267 : @entity268 as part of the @entity270 in september ' one by one like dominos from @entity273 to @entity274 , fashion is selling out to the ignorant masses for money			1
' what happened to the art , the cerebral part of fashion ? did it really all die with @entity282 ? ' gone is the prestige you once felt as a “ chosen one ” by @entity189 , @entity234 or @entity287 — this cheapens your entire experience			0
' you thought you were special , that your hard work had finally paid off			2
you did n’t realize that these coveted spots were for sale			0
' the cost ? the soul and dignity of a fashion house			0
' the clothes will still sell , and the players will still play , but the image will be forever tarnished by these real life @entity301 buying their way in with sleazy fame rights			0
