by @entity0 @entity2 services have returned to normal after operators repaired around half a mile of overhead power lines in the tunnel			1
passengers have endured two days of delays and cancellations after the overhead problem led to the breakdown of a @entity12 - bound shuttle train at around 7.30am yesterday			1
this led to evacuation of nearly 400 passengers , plus four dogs , who were taken on to @entity12 by another shuttle train via the service tunnel			1
services are returning to normal this afternoon following repairs which @entity33 said have taken around 24 hours			1
the broken - down shuttle was driven from the site by a diesel locomotive and brought to the platform in @entity12 , where customers were reunited with their vehicles to continue their onward journeys			0
@entity33 director @entity41 said : ' we apologise to our customers for any disruption that the events yesterday may have caused			1
the safety of the passengers is always our first concern			0
' once that is assured , we want them to be comfortable , well informed and well looked after			0
the recent installation of mobile telephone services inside the tunnel helped us keep our customers informed during the incident '			2
earlier today , four of the high - speed @entity22 train services to the continent had to be cancelled and there were long delays reported on @entity60 to @entity62 shuttle services			1
after long queues at the @entity33 terminal yesterday ( pictured ) , passengers reported delays again today many passengers took to @entity68 to complain about the four delays to getting on a shuttle train the delays were made worse by cyclists and their teams crossing the channel for the @entity75 @entity22 said passengers who had a booking on a cancelled train could exchange their ticket , free of charge , for another available service within the next four months			1
meanwhile , thousands of people on domestic services were late for work today because of a rail track defect , just 24 hours after @entity86 was fined for missing punctuality targets			0
packed trains into @entity89 in @entity90 were delayed because of the problem at @entity92 in @entity93			0
@entity95 station services from @entity93 were among those disrupted			0
there were also delays to @entity99 and @entity101 services in the @entity102 due to a broken - down train			2
it came after 382 passengers were forced to walk down a service tunnel after their train broke down the incident blocked one of the channel tunnel 's two tracks yesterday , throwing travel plans into chaos the @entity2 is about 40 metres below the sea bed , has two main tunnels and a central service tunnel connected to both			1
the south tunnel goes from @entity12 to the @entity119 and the north from the @entity119 to @entity12 the south tunnel takes trains from @entity12 to the @entity119 and the north tunnel from the @entity119 to @entity12			0
a smaller service tunnel runs between them and is connected to both at 375 metre intervals			1
this allows access for maintenance and emergency services and also serves as a safe haven if passengers need to be evacuated from their train in an incident			2
in order to deal with blockages , the two main tunnels are each split into three ' intervals '			0
these are designed in a way which means that if a train breaks down inside , services can still run through the length of the tunnel			2
the tunnel 's interval system allows trains to pass through even when one tunnel is blocked this is possible because the @entity2 has two undersea crossovers allowing trains to pass from one tunnel to the other to avoid and isolate a section of tunnel that is blocked			0
yesterday , almost 400 people were walked from interval two in the north tunnel into the service tunnel and then into a train waiting in interval one in the the south tunnel			1
the train then used a crossover to take it back into interval four and then along the correct tunnel that nearly always takes services to @entity12			2
trains from @entity12 to @entity119 have been taking the same route for ninety minutes but are then forced to wait as trains from @entity119 to @entity12 do the same , causing the delays .			0

power line problems in the tunnel had led to second day of disruption
@entity22 services from @entity90 had experienced one hour delays
