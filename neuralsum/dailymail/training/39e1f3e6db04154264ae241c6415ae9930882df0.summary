last month ’s @entity0 saw @entity1 and @entity2 take a back seat as another name stepped into the limelight			0
after years of @entity8 obscurity , the department store @entity6 staged an almost complete red - carpet takeover			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , among others , all wore beautiful swishing floor - length bejewelled gowns sold by the store			1
it was a fashion coup that , overnight , propelled @entity6 back into middle - class consciousness			1
in @entity6 : @entity19 @entity10 at the @entity20 since then sales of @entity23 evening wear , worn by @entity12 and @entity13 on the night , have more than doubled			1
but it ’s simplistic to say the forgotten department store ’s success is down to one night of headlines			2
in fact , @entity6 has been quietly creeping up on its competitors for some time			1
it announced record sales of £ 1.2 billion in 2013 , which were up £ 30 million on the year before			1
it ’s a figure that ’s a long way from the £ 4.4 million losses it suffered in 2005			0
so why is the chain succeeding where its competitors , including @entity37 and @entity38 , are facing difficulties ? stylist @entity40 thinks part of the reason is that it offers a vast array of sophisticated labels compared with other department stores , @entity38 and @entity37 in particular			0
indeed , the number of womenswear brands across @entity6 stores and online is 500 and counting			1
pretty in pink : @entity51 wearing @entity6 at the @entity20 more importantly , @entity40 thinks @entity6 ’s unique labels give sales a big boost			1
‘ it has a vast number of different designers that you ca n’t get anywhere else on the @entity8 such as @entity23 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
’ it ’s here that @entity6 has changed tack dramatically , with such success			1
where it used to sell a multitude of concessions such as @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 — brands that often had a stand - alone store just a few doors down the @entity8 — now it ’s chosen to favour in - house labels and exciting new designers not seen elsewhere			1
and it is finally listening to the customer			0
since 2011 , the store has been cleverly analysing the feedback it receives from customers , both online and in store			0
it has encouraged @entity6 to introduce next - evening deliveries everywhere and same - day deliveries within the @entity84 , click - and - collect ordering services , as well as computers that allow you to order from within the store			1
another reason for the turn of fortune is down to @entity91 , who joined the company in 2009 , heading up the womenswear department			0
in a previous role at @entity37 , she helped to create the phenomenally successful designers at @entity37 range			0
@entity91 introduced the new @entity23 and @entity61 ranges at @entity6 before restructuring the womenswear department			1
she left for @entity38 in 2012 , and has been tackling their resurgence since			0
the foundations laid at @entity6 are still in place — and have been built on with a carefully calibrated move upmarket that has n’t sacrificed affordability			2
as well as many £ 250 - plus evening gowns , there are cocktail numbers for well below £ 100 , such as @entity69 ’s £ 60 twist - back maxi dress , or @entity109 ’s chic blue satin dress at £ 85			2
not super-cheap , but very reasonable for occasionwear			0
looking sophisticated : @entity13 wears a full - length @entity6 dress to the @entity20 ‘ people feel that a lot of the brands at @entity6 are a little bit of a treat because they ’re more than they ’d normally spend , but they ’re not totally out of their price range , ’ says @entity40			1
however , the company ’s journey from forgotten @entity8 monolith to desirable destination has not been a smooth one			0
established in 1864 as a cloth merchant in @entity125 , @entity6 was owned by @entity126 and @entity127			2
from the @entity129 , the @entity126 family drove expansion and began to buy up the competition , acquiring more than 50 new stores in the seventies alone			0
and while some shops retained their local identity — @entity138 ’s venerable @entity137 , for example — most lost their names , rejected in favour of @entity6 , a result of the branding juggernaut that made the @entity8 of the past 20 years so monotonous			2
many of those @entity6 - owned stores have closed in the past two decades to streamline the business , but the move has turned much - loved local landmarks into empty , crumbling buildings			1
that move may have kept the company in business , but for many shoppers , goodwill was thrown away			0
happily for @entity6 , public opinion seems to have turned again , aided by recent celebrity endorsements on the red carpet			2
‘ people really like to see celebrities wearing a @entity8 dress and making it look designer			0
i think celebrities are definitely changing their attitudes to trying the @entity8 , ’ says @entity40			0
if she ’s right , @entity6 might just be on to a winning formula .			2

@entity10 , @entity51 and @entity12 wore @entity6 dresses to the @entity20
@entity6 announced record sales of £ *1.2billion* in 2013
the store now favours in - house labels and designers not seen elsewhere
