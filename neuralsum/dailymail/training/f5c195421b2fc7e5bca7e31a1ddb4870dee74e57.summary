in a tense standoff with an increasingly impatient @entity4 press corps , president @entity1 's chief spokesman refused to answer a yes - or - no question about whether the president still has ' confidence ' in @entity8 secretary @entity9			1
during a press briefing on may 19 , @entity10 stated flatly that ' the president has confidence in @entity13			1
' but on thursday he dodged a point - blank dare to repeat that endorsement			0
and he calmly offered a contradictory set of guidelines about actions the @entity8 and the @entity4 should take in response to the brewing veterans ' health care scandal			2
' the va should not and must not wait for the current investigation of @entity8 operations to conclude before taking steps to improve care			1
' but moments later he told reporters that president @entity1 will wait before taking action			1
' the president identified last week that he expected a preliminary report from @entity13 's internal audit very soon , ' instructed @entity10			1
' and once he receives that he 'll be able to evaluate those findings along with what we 're seen in the interim report from the inspector general , and then assess where we are at that time			0
' realistically , that could come by the end of the weekend , though – giving @entity1 ' a whole lot more facts , ' @entity10 said , about the agency 's internal corruption			1
' we 'll be very interested in the results , ' @entity10 assured reporters			2
on wednesday the @entity8 's inspector general released its own separate preliminary report showing that veterans in @entity66 , @entity67 waited an average of 115 days for a first medical appointment , and that 1,700 of them were left off of waiting lists and denied care entirely			1
about 40 veterans died while waiting to see doctors			0
toward the end of an hour - long rhetorical kabuki dance on thursday , an @entity76 reporter asked @entity10 ' a very simple yes - or - no question : does the president have confidence in @entity13 ? ' @entity10 dissembled and drew from a briefing book full of talking points			1
' the president believes that – and is confident that @entity85 has served his nation admirably , heroically as a soldier , as a general , and that he has accomplished some very important things as secretary of veterans affairs , ' he said			0
' and i listed them , but they include extending education benefits , reducing veterans ' homelessness , and reducing the backlog for disability claims while expanding vastly the number of veterans who can make a claim			0
' glutton for punishment : @entity10 ( @entity104 ) seen exiting @entity105 with national security adviser @entity106 ( r ) , is @entity1 's dedicated spear - catcher -- and has been fielding tough questions as the @entity8 scandal deepens tensions : congressional republicans verbally flayed a trio of @entity8 officials thursday night in a rare evening hearing on @entity115			1
' veterans died ! ' the @entity118 's chairman barked at one			0
' get us the answers ! ' ' fire him ! ' : @entity67 @entity122 sen. @entity122 has led a parade of four dozen members of @entity125 who are demanding @entity9 's ouster ' but does the president right now have confidence in @entity13 ? ' the reporter parried			1
' yes or no ? it 's a very simple yes - or - no question			2
' @entity10 said he would n't ' improve on ' @entity1 's words from a may 21 briefing , dismissing questions as ' wordplay			2
' @entity1 , however , was never asked directly whether @entity9 's job was safe			2
@entity10 began his regular briefing more than an hour after its originally scheduled starting time			0
despite the @entity8 scandal hanging in the air , he opened up with a soliloquy about nutrition			0
support for the secretary has eroded on @entity115 , with nearly 50 members of @entity125 calling for his ouster			0
many are @entity148 facing tough re-election battles in states where @entity151 dominate the electorate .			0

@entity4 press secretary balks at ' simple yes - or - no question '
ten days ago he told reporters that ' the president has confidence in @entity13 '
but now the @entity8 secretary is reportedly on ' *probation* ' and @entity10 wo n't say @entity1 is prepared to keep him
@entity10 also *insisted* that the @entity8 ' should not and must not wait for the current investigation of @entity8 operations to conclude ' before fixing things
but in the same breath , he said @entity1 will wait until two separate investigations are over before *deciding* what to do
there 's an outside chance the president could act this weekend after @entity9 delivers his internal report on the *crisis* to the @entity4
