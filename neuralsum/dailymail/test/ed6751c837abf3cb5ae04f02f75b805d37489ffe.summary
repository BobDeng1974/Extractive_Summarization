@entity0 is embroiled in fresh controversy over its tax affairs after it was accused of using a little - known @entity4 company to avoid paying taxes across @entity6			1
the @entity8 coffee giant is being probed by the @entity9 over some of the methods it used to lower its tax bills			0
it could face millions of pounds in back taxes if they are found to be illegal			0
for the first time yesterday , details emerged about the @entity4 company at the heart of the probe , which is focusing on sweetheart tax deals between @entity0 and the @entity24 government			1
probe : @entity0 ran its @entity6 division - including the @entity4 - through the @entity24 , but it paid just £ 1.9million in tax to the @entity24 government , from a reported £ 300million profit @entity0 ran its @entity6 business , including its booming @entity4 division , through the @entity24 where it paid almost no tax on its profits			1
but it has now emerged that the coffee chain used a defunct @entity4 entity to hide potentially millions of pounds from the @entity24 taxman			2
by registering its @entity37 – such as its brand and logo – in a @entity4 company called @entity41 , it was able to pay hefty sums from its @entity24 division into @entity4			1
its @entity24 division paid just £ 1.9million of tax , despite reporting profits of £ 300million – a meagre tax rate of less than 1per cent			1
a @entity50 investigation has uncovered previously unknown details about the @entity4 entity , including a claim that it had not a single registered employee			2
@entity0 has already been called ‘ immoral ’ by mps for its labyrinthine structure that effectively funnelled money out of the @entity4			2
schemes used by the company include buying its coffee beans in @entity61 and selling them at a 20per cent mark - up to the @entity24 , where they are then roasted before being sold on again to @entity4			1
this means that much of the money it makes from @entity4 sales flows into jurisdictions that have lower or less stringent tax regimes			0
revealed : it is now claimed the company , which has previously been in the spotlight for its tax practices , may have used a @entity4 company to put hefty sums from its @entity24 branch into the @entity4 between 1998 and 2012 the company paid just £ 8.6million in corporation tax in @entity4 , despite racking up combined sales of more than £ 3billion here			1
but after its tactics were exposed , the company offered to pay a voluntary £ 20million in tax to avoid a public boycott			0
now details of a little - known tax division have emerged			0
a @entity4 - registered holding business called @entity41 was set up to house the branding of the business			1
in a bizarre move , @entity87 appeared to have no employees – and was registered at the offices of @entity0 ’s tax lawyers @entity91			0
compliance : a @entity0 spokesman said the company complies ' with all relevant tax rules , laws , and @entity99 guidelines ' but because of the very limited details available , it is impossible to identify how much money the arm received – or whether it paid any tax in the @entity4			1
accounts for @entity0 ’ @entity24 businesses show that they paid several million pounds a year into the division			2
but without access to full corporate documents it is impossible to tell whether this remained in the @entity4 division or was funnelled straight into another tax haven			0
the business , which was closed down last year , has never filed proper accounts at @entity116			0
when it was dissolved , @entity87 was folded into a new company , @entity118 – though this business has also yet to file any accounts			0
this is an aspect that @entity123 investigators believe is key to their probe			0
earlier this year the @entity4 boss of @entity0 provoked outrage after suggesting the company would not pay ‘ normal ’ levels of tax for years			2
@entity4 managing director @entity130 said the company needed to get ‘ its mojo back ’ before it would begin to turn a profit			0
but he was confounded only weeks later when @entity0 reported its first ever @entity4 profit of £ 1.1million – despite sales being a bumper £ 300million			1
on this it paid taxes of just £ 232,363 , as well as the sum of £ 11.2million as part of its voluntary £ 20million tax payment			0
a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ we comply with all relevant tax rules , laws , and @entity99 guidelines and we continue to cooperate with the @entity9 ’s state aid investigation in the @entity24			1

@entity0 ran its @entity6 business - including @entity4 - through @entity148
but @entity24 division paid just £ 1.9million tax on profits of £ 300million
now details of @entity4 company at heart of new probe have started to emerge
a @entity0 spokesman said it complies ' with all relevant tax rules , laws '
