petrol prices should be slashed by 7p a litre by @entity3 to keep pace with plummeting oil prices , the @entity0 says today			1
the ' overdue cut ' would bring pump prices down to 114p a litre and deliver some added festive cheer , it said			1
the @entity0 's own monitoring of fuel prices shows there is ' scope for the price of a litre of petrol to come down by more than 7p a litre '			1
the motoring company is urging retailers to lower fuel prices in the run up to @entity3 ( file image ) diesel should drop by nearly 6p , it added : ' this would bring the average price of a litre of petrol to 114p and diesel to 120p – prices last seen across the country in march 2010			1
' the @entity0 said : ' we are urgently calling on fuel retailers to pass on further savings in the wholesale price brought about by the continued fall in world oil prices			1
' this overdue cut would reduce the biggest cost of motoring just in time for @entity3			2
currently , the average price of petrol stands at 120.84p , with diesel at 125.43p			2
at the start of the year petrol was 130.79p a litre and diesel was 138.24p			0
the motoring organisation said that in june this year a barrel of crude reached a 2014 high of $ 115.36 – and the highest price since september last year			2
but since then it has fallen dramatically and as of thursday stood at $ 68.59 – a fall of $ 46.77 or nearly 60 per cent			0
the @entity0 said : ' while the falling oil price has been reflected at the pumps by retailers consistently reducing forecourt prices , the latest savings in the wholesale price need to be passed on quickly to demonstrate transparency			1
' @entity0 fuel spokesman @entity63 said : ' the tumbling oil price , coupled with a pound that is still strong against the dollar , have led to a phenomenon that many motorists are pretty unfamiliar with – falling pump prices			1
' @entity71 and @entity72 are among retailers lowering prices			1
above , the costs of fuel in 2005 he said the forecast 7p a litre reduction that retailers should be passing on ' is the biggest the @entity0 has seen in recent years			1
' petrol began to come down from its record high of 142.48p a litre on 17 april 2012			0
@entity83 hit its record high of 147.93p on 13 april 2012 )			0
supermarkets such as @entity72 and @entity71 have been driving with price cuts , prompting retailers nearby to follow suit			1
mr @entity63 said : ' retailers now have a very reasonable record on transparent pricing so we have no reason to believe that they will not pass on the savings in the wholesale price			2
' we just urge them to do it sooner rather than later to make the point very clearly to motorists that they operate a fair pricing system			0
' if they do , we could well see petrol pump prices fall by well over 7p a litre in the next few weeks and diesel by almost 6p a litre			0
' with this kind of drop in the national average prices , motorists will no doubt see some very low petrol prices – perhaps under 110p a litre from retailers who pride themselves on having the lowest prices			1
' the @entity0 said that with petrol at 114p a litre motorists would be saving over £ 9 filling up an average 55 - litre family car compared to the beginning of the year , with the cost falling from £ 71.93 down to £ 62.70			2
diesel at 120p a litre would save drivers £ 10 per fill - up – down from £ 76.03 to £ 66			0
mr @entity63 said : ' this will be very welcome news just in time for @entity3 when household budgets are really stretched			0
it should also be another boost for business as it will lower operating costs substantially			0
' but he warned : ' while motorists are enjoying much lower forecourt prices it 's important to recognise that they will always be limited by fuel duty , which represents nearly 58p in every litre , and vat which is charged on top , at around 20p a litre			0
' he said a driver filling up a 55 - litre petrol car at 114p a litre would pay £ 62.70 of which £ 31.87p would be duty , £ 10.45 vat and only £ 20.38 for the fuel itself			0
in the @entity144 chancellor @entity143 also said he was freezing fuel duty ' to help hardworking people be more financially secure			0
' motorway filling stations – accused by motoring groups and ministers of ' ripping off ' drivers with sky high prices - will soon have to post their charges in advance on roadside poles so motorists can decide whether to drive on by for a cheaper deal elsewhere , the government announced this week taking a leaf from the @entity159 where this is law			2
transport minister @entity161 said : ' for too long drivers have been ripped off by petrol prices on motorways			1
' treasury chief secretary @entity165 warned recently : ' when the price of oil falls , the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone , not a feather			0
' he was acting on long - standing complaints of motoring groups that pump prices rise ' like a rocket ' when oil costs go up , but fall ' like a feather ' when they come down .			2

petrol prices should be lowered to give drivers festive cheer , said @entity0
motoring company said cuts in the price of fuel are ' long overdue '
