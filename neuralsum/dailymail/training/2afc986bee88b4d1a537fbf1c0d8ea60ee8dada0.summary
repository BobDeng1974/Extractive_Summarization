by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:54 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 14:04 est , 3 december 2012 at five storeys high , it stood in the middle of a newly - built motorway as a symbol of resistance			1
but after refusing to relocate while authorities built a giant road around their home , an elderly @entity9 couple has finally admitted defeat			1
in front of a crowd of onlookers , bulldozers and diggers moved in to tear the stubborn house to the ground			0
@entity21 and his wife previously insisted on staying in the half - demolished building in the city of @entity25 , @entity26 province , because they believed that the relocation compensation offered by the government was not enough			1
beginning of the end : @entity31 began on the house 's deconstruction on saturday city of @entity25 , @entity26 province			0
it is understood the couple finally accepted a compensation deal to relocate tumbling down : onlookers gather to watch the house being demolished			1
it had become a symbol of resistance against developers standing strong : @entity21 , 67 , who lived in the house on the outskirts of @entity25 in east @entity9 's @entity26 province , previously refused to leave as he said the compensation offered was no enough the couple were the only the only remaining occupants of their neighbourhood after the road was constructed to lead to a new rail station on the outskirts of the city			1
the road had not yet been officially opened while the couple still lived in the property - a situation that would have made their occupancy even more dangerous			2
duck farmer @entity21 , 67 , had previously refused the government 's paltry compensation of 220,000 yuan ( £ 22,000 ) for relocation			1
he spent 600,000 yuan ( £ 60,000 ) completing the house			0
it is understood that the couple finally accepted an increased offer of 260,000 yuan ( £ 26,000 ) so see their home demolished			1
@entity9 authorities often pressure residents into accepting compensation packages if their homes are in the way of development projects			1
extreme methods , such as cutting off utilities , are often used to hasten the eviction			0
but @entity21 's village chief said that the man had voluntarily accepted the offer and had tired of the attention his home was receiving			1
proof : mr @entity21 stands in front of his home holding the certificate that states he owns the land beneath it , meaning that he and his wife could't be forced to move away @entity91 : the house stood strong in the middle of the highway after their entire neighbourhood had been torn down calm before the storm : the balcony from mr @entity21 's home looked peaceful , but he was finally forced to move before the road was opened to traffic village chief @entity102 said : ' @entity21 received dozens of people from the media every day and his house stands in the center of the road			2
so he decided to demolish the house			0
' to ensure the couple ’s safety , adjacent rooms in the building had been left intact after all their neighbours had moved out			0
real estate has been a significant driver of the @entity9 's economic prowess in recent decades			1
during most of the @entity120 era , private ownership of property was abolished , making it easy for residents to be moved on - but now the laws have been tightened up and it is illegal to demolish property by force without an agreement			1
@entity128 : mr @entity21 looks wistfully across the new scenery , the tarmac from the new road waving haphazardly along the side of the building and demarcating the homeowner 's land room with a view : @entity21 looks out on the new road - yet to be officially opened - from the apartment building where all his neighbours moved out thinking laterally : unperturbed by the couple 's decision to remain in the property , developers simply paved around the house rapid development has cost tens of thousands of objecting people their homes , as they are eventually forced out to make way for new housing , factories and other business ventures , creating a major source of unrest			2
property owners in @entity9 that refuse to move to make way for development are known as ' @entity157 ' referring to a stubborn nail that is not easy to remove from a piece of old wood and can not be pulled out with a hammer			2
earlier this year , @entity162 , 75 , and her husband @entity163 , who live in the two dilapidated buildings with their two sons , had initially agreed to sell the property in @entity168 , in @entity26 province and accepted £ 8,000 in compensation			2
but then she changed her mind and refunded the money once work on the road had started			0
isolated : @entity175 and @entity177 's home stands on a small parcel of land amid the growing skyscrapers earlier this year , @entity175 and @entity177 dared to stand in the way of a local property developer in @entity183 , in the @entity185 province			0
as a result , the resolute couple , both in their 60s , have been left stranded on their tiny spot of land , while all around them the ground is dug up and skyscrapers erected			0
the distraught pair were regularly threatened by gangsters and have had to fend over a number of attempts to illegally demolish their ramshackle home			0
they were cut off from utilities in 2009 when a local developer started the enormous earthworks involved in building dozens of high - rise residential buildings in the area			0
refuse to move : another family initially agreed to sell the property in @entity168 but changed their minds once work on the road had started stranded : the couple were left without running water and electricity ground after real estate developers dug out the ground around it can not demolish : during the @entity120 era , private ownership of property was abolished but now the laws have been tightened up and it is illegal to demolish property by force without an agreement in another case , one family among 280 others at the site of a six storey shopping mall being built in @entity230 refused to leave their home for two years			1
developers cut their power and water , and excavated a 10 - meter deep pit around their home , which their family had inhabited for three generations			2
the owners broke into the construction site , reoccupied it , and flew a @entity9 flag on top and then @entity244 , a local martial arts champion , used nunchakus to make a staircase to the house and threatened to beat any authorities who attempted to evict him			1
the owners turned down an offer of £ 300,000 but eventually settled with the developers in 2007			0
high and dry : a furious family took legal action against property developers in @entity258 , south west @entity9 , last year after they demolished every staircase in their seven - storey apartment block in a bizarre bid to make them vacate their top - floor flat so they could build a factory ( pictured , top , with the flower boxes and awnings ) that 's prime retail estate ! with space at premium in the densely populated city of @entity272 in central @entity9 's @entity273 , homeowners decided to build these villas on the roof of the @entity277 shopping centre , which is home to one of most famous wholesale markets for shoes in the region architectural triumph or just plain pants ? it has been trumpeted as ' a dramatic , iconic gateway ' to the @entity286 that makes the @entity287 look like a mere ornament , but critics of he £ 445m @entity290 in @entity292 , @entity9 , have likened the structure to a giant pair of long johns @entity297 bah gum ! @entity298 , yes			1
but the gloss was taken off ever so slightly when @entity301 's new @entity300 ( above ) was compared by some observers earlier this year to a huge @entity304 pudding			0
the building boasts 65,000sqm of floor space for offices , restaurants and the headquarters of @entity9 's @entity310 the world 's silliest supertower ? towering 328 metres ( 1,067ft ) above the ground , this skyscraper in @entity313 , @entity314 province , dwarfs everything in its path			2
it is 18 metres taller than the @entity319 in @entity320 and its closest rival is 600 miles away in @entity301			0
but that 's because it was built in a village of 2,000 farmers a touch out of place , perhaps ? near the rice paddies , groves of yellow bamboo and the homes of tens of millions of dirt - poor migrant workers lies this bizarre replica of an @entity335 in the southern @entity9 province of @entity337			2
unsurprisingly , sales were non-existent when it opened earlier this year			0

elderly couple refused to have their home demolished , saying the compensation offered was not enough
but they are thought to have accepted an increased amount from the @entity9 government
@entity350 became a symbol of resistance against authorities that often pressure residents into making way for developers
