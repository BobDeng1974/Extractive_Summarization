the move underlines the improving relations between @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity11 , with the latter having previously demanded that @entity24 officials hand over militants operating in its territory			1
during his visit on sunday , @entity27 said the @entity24 army and police forces have made a lot of progress in the war since 2001 - but at the cost of much @entity3 blood and treasure			1

it also aims to avoid the kind of unraveling of security that happened this year in @entity107 ; large swathes of which have been taken over by militants fighting for the @entity111 ( @entity112 )			0
the @entity114 base - which includes soldiers from the @entity116 and the @entity117 - has been deemed exemplary of @entity3 's new mission by president @entity119			1
it will be one of four ' train , advise , @entity122 ' across the country , while several training establishments in @entity4 's capital , @entity126 , will also be used by @entity3 forces			1
but despite the noncombat focus of the mission , @entity3 special operations forces will continue , mostly in conjunction with @entity24 forces , to hunt down @entity101 remnants or other terrorists			2
they will also take on the @entity10 if they are deemed to pose a threat to @entity3 troop security			2
speaking to the @entity3 troops , @entity27 warned the soldiers there is no room for complacency and no reason to think that their training and advising work will not present its own risks			1
' the job 's not done , ' he said			2
' this is still a dangerous country in many ways			2
' the soldiers ' mission with @entity154 allies will assume a new name on january 1 : ' @entity156			0
' meanwhile , the combat mission , @entity157 , will finish at the end of december			0
