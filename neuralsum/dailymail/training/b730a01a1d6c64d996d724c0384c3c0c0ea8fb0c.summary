by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:37 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 18:59 est , 23 may 2013 @entity3 yesterday tore up an order banning troops from wearing their uniforms in public that was issued in the wake of the @entity11 attack			1
he is understood to have told defence secretary @entity12 he was ‘ seriously dismayed ’ at official guidance given to personnel in @entity15 following the murder			2
as the row raged in @entity18 , troops and their families posted pictures of themselves in full uniform online , in defiance of the ruling from the @entity25			2
strength : prime minister @entity3 gave a statement in @entity28 , vowing that the terrorists will not divide @entity30 but make it stronger armed : military personnel in uniform stand guard at @entity35 yesterday , where security has been tightened insisting that the ban be rescinded , mr @entity3 told a meeting of the @entity40 emergency committee in @entity18 : ‘ the best way to defeat terrorism is for everyone – including our brave service personnel – to go about their lives as normal			1
’ the dressing down was a blow for mr @entity12 , who is understood to have agreed that the uniform ban should be implemented			1
security had been tightened within hours of the attack amid fears that other military personnel could be targeted in ‘ copycat ’ strikes			1
instructions issued to commanders said that troops should be ‘ advised to maintain a low public profile until further information is received ; uniforms should be concealed while in a public place , particularly when travelling alone or from home to unit			1
defiant : soldiers walk outside @entity65 , @entity66 , close to the scene where a soldier was murdered in @entity69 floral tributes , and a t - shirt , have been left outside the @entity72 , near the scene where a solider was brutally murdered in broad daylight ‘ specifically in @entity77 , uniform is not to be worn outside units or when travelling to and from units unless authorised at military one - star level or above			1
’ @entity81 arrived at @entity28 for the @entity40 meeting with a warning that the @entity11 knife attack must not be blamed on @entity30 foreign policy			1
' it is completely wrong to blame this killing on the religion of @entity89 , but it is also equally wrong to try to draw any link between this murder and @entity30 foreign policy or the actions of @entity30 forces who are risking their lives abroad for the sake of freedom			2
' the fault lies wholly and exclusively in the warped and deluded mindset of the people who did it			2
' what we need now is , for the sake of the victim and the sake of his family , for those killers to be brought to justice			2
' i think i want to pay particular tribute , not just to the work of the police and security services yesterday			2
' but also , above all , to the people of @entity11 , who showed such exemplary courage and bravery in a very difficult situation indeed			2
' ' the people of @entity15 should take their cue , from the behaviour of the people of @entity11 yesterday , who showed such astonishing natural courage in dealing with an appalling event , and who stood up to these killers			0
' i think that that ’s the spirit of @entity15 , and that ’s what i would call upon people to do today : go about their lives in the normal way			1
' but current and former servicemen defied the ruling by posting pictures online			0
former soldier @entity139 , of @entity140 in @entity141 , was among those who posted a picture of himself in uniform			0
he wrote on @entity145 : ‘ the government ’s decision to ban military personnel wearing uniform in public whilst investigations are being carried out is ridiculous ! backing down already ! ‘ been out of the forces for three years to the day … @entity152 i could do for this innocent soldier and his family			1
@entity155 ! ! ’ the heightened state of alert was a throwback to the 1970s and 1980s , when military personnel were ordered to wear civilian clothes on the streets because of the threat from the @entity162			1
in recent years , troops have been encouraged to wear their uniforms in public			1
but jihadist websites have urged @entity168 extremists to target those in uniform as revenge for @entity30 forces fighting in @entity172			0
colonel @entity182 , a former commander in @entity172 , said he opposed the restrictions , explaining : ‘ as we saw in this case you do n’t need to have somebody in uniform , you just need to have someone who knows a bit about soldiers and does a bit of observation in the vicinity of a barracks and can identify a soldier very quickly			1
’ general sir @entity187 , the @entity188 , also lent his support to mr @entity3 ’s decision			1
he said he believed it was an ‘ isolated incident ’ , adding : ‘ there is no reason at all why we should not wear our uniforms with pride , but on a common sense basis			1
’ @entity198 , 49 , whose 22 - year - old son @entity199 died in a @entity201 bomb blast in 2009 , said : ‘ it ’s a sad reflection of @entity30 when they ’re being advised not to wear their uniforms but to go out in civvies			2
@entity206 : two women soldiers walk along a path in @entity11 shortly after the murder in south - east @entity15 ‘ i do n’t want them hurt , of course , but they should be allowed to wear their tunics with pride			0
' the best way to defeat terrorism is for everyone – including our brave service personnel – to go about their lives as normal ' prime minister @entity3 ' it used to be that our soldiers in uniforms were applauded on the streets but now the country has become too lily - livered			1
’ sources close to the @entity228 said the ban was part of a raft of ‘ immediate and automatic reactive security measures ’ after the attack			1
a @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ following a review of the situation this morning , a decision has been taken to relax some of these temporary measures imposed yesterday			2
’ the @entity11 atrocity was an attack on the @entity30 way of life , @entity3 said yesterday			1
but , speaking outside @entity28 after chairing the crisis committee @entity40 , he insisted the outrage would serve to unite different communities			0
‘ what happened in @entity11 yesterday has sickened us all , ’ said the prime minister			0
‘ the people who did this were trying to divide us			0
they should know something like this will only bring us together , make us stronger			0
’ mr @entity3 said the attack was a betrayal of @entity89 and ‘ solely and purely ’ the responsibility of the accused			1
‘ this view is shared by every community in our country , ’ he added			0
‘ this was not just an attack on @entity30 and on the @entity30 way of life ; it was also a betrayal of @entity89 and of the @entity168 communities who give so much to our country			2
there is nothing in @entity89 that justifies this truly dreadful act			0
’ the prime minister said @entity30 would be resolute in its ‘ stand against violent extremism ’			0
‘ we will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms , ’ he added			0
‘ we will defeat violent extremism by standing together , by backing our police and security services , and above all by challenging the poisonous narrative of extremism on which this violence feeds			0
@entity30 works with our international partners to make the world safe from terrorism – terrorism that has taken more @entity168 lives than any other religion			0
it is an utter perversion of the truth to pretend anything different			0
’ president @entity291 said : ‘ the @entity292 stands resolute with the @entity30 , our ally and friend , against violent extremism and terror			0
‘ there can be absolutely no justification for such acts , and our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim , the police and security services responding to this horrific act and the communities they serve , and the @entity30 people			0
’ @entity310 , minister for faith and communities , said she had been ‘ incredibly impressed ’ by the way in which @entity168 communities had ‘ unreservedly and unitedly condemned ’ the barbaric acts .			0
