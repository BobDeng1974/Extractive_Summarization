by @entity1 reporter published : 13:21 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 15:25 est , 17 may 2013 @entity3 ’s @entity2 has publicly named the man who it says is the @entity6 station chief in @entity7			1
the unusual decision to release the identity of the agent who arrested @entity12 diplomat @entity11 after he tried to recruit him , is said to be a breach of intelligence protocol			1
according to the @entity16 , there could be an angry response from the @entity18 as the names of intelligence officers are not released to the public			0
a diplomat with the same name is listed as a counsellor in the @entity12 @entity7 embassy			2
it was unclear if he was still based in the country , said the @entity16			0
undercover diplomat @entity11 has been mercilessly mocked on the web both in @entity3 and the @entity31 for his apparently amateurish boy 's @entity33 approach to espionage in @entity7			1
' the man behaved like an officer worthy of his name , detaining the recruiter and handing him over to counterintelligence authorities ' said an @entity2 source yesterday			1
' he will continue to serve			0
there is no threat to his career			0
' the @entity3 have not named the target of the @entity6 approach but he is believed to be a specialist in terrorism linked to extremist @entity79 groupings			2
@entity11 called him seeking a meeting at which he intended to recruit him , it is claimed			0
instead he ended up face on the ground , and handcuffed , before being taken to the notorious @entity84 of the secret services for questioning			0
@entity88 agents first came across the @entity3 agent when they were given assistance by @entity7 over the @entity91 , it is understood			1
@entity11 , 29 , a third secretary in the embassy 's political department , was detained wearing a blond wig under his baseball cap while on a mission to recruit the @entity2 operative on the night of may 13			0
in his possession , @entity11 had another wig , a compass , a map of @entity7 , sunglasses , and a ' @entity104 ' letter - apparently translated into @entity3 on @entity105 - which offered $ 1 million a year plus bonuses to the @entity2 man			1
@entity11 has been ordered to leave @entity3 in the next few days			2
statement : ' recently , the @entity12 intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of @entity3 law enforcement agencies and special services , ' according to the @entity2 stash : he was detained with ' special technical devices , written instructions for the person he was recruiting , a lot of cash , and things to help change one 's appearance , ' according to the @entity2 mission : the website of the @entity12 embassy in @entity3 informs that its political section is engaged in ' bringing to the attention of the @entity3 government the @entity12 position on the issues of foreign policy and security ' questions : a letter the agent carried suggested the @entity12 government was willing to pay up to $ 1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential @entity3 recruit , if the letter released by the @entity2 is genuine release : @entity11 was held overnight before being released to @entity12 officials and expelled from @entity3 the arrest of @entity11 is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the @entity12 and @entity3			1
famously , 10 @entity3 sleeper agents were arrested in june 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary americans while secretly plotting against the country			2
the best - known is @entity151 , above , who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the @entity12 in the @entity158 period , however , @entity12 - @entity156 espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985 , military officer @entity154 was shot dead by a @entity156 sentry while spying in @entity163			2
one of the war 's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an @entity12 spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot			0
the @entity2 stressed yesterday that the @entity12 and @entity3 ' will try to avoid ratcheting up tension around the @entity11 case , focusing instead on the positive aspects of their relations '			1
but @entity3 intelligence services say they have trapped a @entity6 ‘ spy ’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior @entity3 agent			1
diplomat @entity11 was thrown down and handcuffed in a night - time sting by the @entity2 secret service – formerly the @entity182			2
he had a rudimentary espionage kit containing a compass , map of @entity7 , knives , a microphone , two wigs , three pairs of glasses , plastic bags containing thousands of euros and an @entity186 , which prevents passports with computer chips being read remotely , @entity3 intelligence sources said			1
the ‘ agent ’ , a third secretary in the political section of the @entity12 embassy , was quizzed in the @entity2 ’s feared @entity55 complex before being handed over to @entity12 officials			2
unusually , the @entity2 made its coup public at once			0
it released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue checked shirt , dirty - blond wig and baseball cap , along with images of him in detention			0
spy sources said @entity11 was caught after a lengthy covert operation			0

@entity11 was caught in @entity215 , an area in south - east @entity7 , the @entity2 said			0
they implied that he wanted to contact a senior @entity2 agent who was snooping on @entity218 , the alleged @entity219 bomber			0
a letter in @entity3 which @entity11 carried suggests – if genuine – that the @entity6 hoped to reel in a big fish			1
addressed ‘ dear friend ’ , it states : ‘ we are ready to offer you $ 100,000 [ £ 65,000 ] and discuss your experience , expertise and co-operation , and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to answer certain questions			0
‘ for long - term co-operation we offer $ 1million [ £ 650,000 ] per year			1
’ the recruit is instructed to use an internet cafe to ‘ create a new @entity235 mailbox which you will use only for staying in touch with us ’			0
