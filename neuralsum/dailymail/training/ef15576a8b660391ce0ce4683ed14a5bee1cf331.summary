it has now been handed over to the @entity1 by @entity2 published : 16:10 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 16:10 est , 6 july 2013 the night of december 7 , 1972 , is forever branded on @entity4 ’s memory			1
that night a gang of masked @entity7 terrorists smashed down the door of his family ’s @entity10 home and dragged out his mother @entity13 , as several of her ten children clutched at her skirts and screamed			1
it was the last time @entity4 , then 11 , was to see his mother alive			2
horror : the remains of @entity7 murder victim @entity19 are recovered from an area near the @entity22 beach in @entity23 in 2003 now , at last , the @entity25 children are on the verge of hearing – from beyond the grave – the confession of the @entity7 woman who drove their mother to her death			1
and in an explosive testimony , she is believed to have named @entity35 , president of @entity36 , as the @entity7 commander who ordered the execution of @entity4 ’s mother			1
@entity35 is accused of ordering the 1972 execution yesterday , 11 clandestine tapes recorded by @entity43 and loyalist paramilitaries , which have languished for ten years in the archives of the @entity45 in @entity46 in the @entity47 , were handed over to the @entity1			1
they include an admission from @entity50 , one of the @entity7 ’s most infamous terrorists , that she ferried @entity4 ’s 37 - year - old mother to the @entity53 where she was tortured , tied up and shot in the head			1
and she asserts it was @entity35 who sanctioned the murder			1
@entity35 , who now sits in the @entity59 ’s parliament , has always strenuously denied belonging to the @entity7 and any involvement in terrorist murders			1
but @entity4 , now 51 , believes the tapes ’ shocking contents could lead to fresh arrests – among them that of @entity35			1
@entity50 ’s damning revelation is corroborated in another tape , made by @entity68 , the terror - hardened deputy commander of the @entity7 ’s @entity69			1
he , too , insists it was @entity35 who signed the @entity74 housewife ’s death warrant			1
yet @entity35 claims credit for shaping the 1996 peace agreement that ended @entity78 ’s @entity77 after he swapped the @entity79 for the ballot box			1
@entity50 and @entity68 , now both dead , agreed to make the tapes with @entity53 academics on the strict proviso they remain locked away while they lived			0
@entity50 ’s death in january this year freed the @entity46 from its obligation to keep them secret			1
the release of the tapes has been at the centre of a bitter legal wrangle			0
@entity36 ’s @entity92 , deputy first minister of the @entity94 and a self - confessed former @entity7 commander , and @entity47 secretary of state @entity96 have waged a high - profile battle to have them suppressed on the grounds that they could derail @entity78 ’s fragile peace process			1
mrs @entity19 with her husband and three of her ten children for @entity4 and his siblings , their hope is that the recordings may at last lead to their mother ’s executioners being brought to justice			1
‘ if @entity50 mentions @entity35 in the tapes , that he was in some way involved and if it can be proved , he should be tried , ’ @entity4 says			1
‘ at the very least i ’d like to see him stand in court and answer the accusations			0
' you ca n’t turn around and say it is right to kill someone the way they did , especially a mother , no matter what your beliefs are			2
’ @entity4 ’s mother , @entity13 , a @entity124 who converted to @entity126 when she married husband @entity127 , had moved to the staunchly @entity43 @entity128 in the @entity130 area after being intimidated out of a loyalist area			2
when the @entity7 eventually confessed to abducting and killing her , they claimed it was because she was a ‘ tout ’ who was passing information to the @entity137			2
@entity35 ( centre ) pictured attending an @entity7 funeral during the troubles the @entity4 family has always insisted that their mother ’s only involvement with the @entity137 was that she once gave succour to an injured squaddie			1
@entity4 has yet to hear the tapes			0
but shortly before she died @entity148 chillingly told me of her role in the murder of his mother – one of 17 @entity7 victims known as the @entity155			1
she told me that her memoir , including her role driving away the @entity155 , was recorded in the @entity158 – as the collection of tapes are known			2
@entity50 , who led the @entity7 terror squad that bombed the @entity162 in 1973 , admitted she drove mrs @entity19 to @entity163 in the @entity53			1
she confessed she was a member of a select unit of the @entity7 ’s @entity69 , codenamed the @entity165 , whose mission was to take those believed to have betrayed @entity43 for interrogation			2
for those found guilty by the @entity43 kangaroo courts , the only sentence was death			2
‘ i never knew for sure their ultimate end , i was simply told by @entity35 to take the people away , ’ @entity35 with one - time friend @entity176 , who was a deputy commander of the @entity7 's @entity69 and also insisted it was @entity35 who signed the @entity74 housewife 's death warrant @entity50 admitted			1
‘ some , i knew their fate , some i did n’t			0
i took seven in all			0
my job was to hand them over to others			0
i do n’t even remember some of their names			0
‘ i drove @entity19 away			1
she was a very , very unpleasant woman			2
i know i should n’t speak ill of the dead and i do n’t think she deserved to die			0
i did n’t know she was a mother			0
‘ i had a call one night and @entity35 was in a house down the @entity191			2
@entity25 had been snatched and held for several days			0
' it was part of my job to take them across the border to hand them over			0
she got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken to a place of safety by the @entity201 [ a @entity126 charity ]			0
son @entity4 believes the tapes ' shocking contents could lead to fresh arrests ¿ among them that of @entity35 ‘ she went on and on about “ them f * * * * * * @entity208 , they would n’t have the balls to shoot me			2
f * * * them ”			0
i was saying to myself “ please do n’t say any more ”			0
but she went on and on , she convicted herself out of her own mouth			0
' it was n’t my decision to “ disappear ” her , thank @entity213			0
all i had to do was drive her			0
i even got her fish and chips and cigarettes before i left her			0
’ @entity50 refused to enlarge on why @entity35 ordered mrs @entity19 ’s execution , but commented : ‘ you do n’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person , as she was , but you do deserve to die if you are an informer			1
that is the @entity43 way			0
’ for the @entity4 children , their mother ’s death blighted their lives for ever			2
today a fragmented family , they rarely meet or discuss the trauma of her being taken			0
@entity4 remembers his older brother @entity127 , then 16 , followed the terrorists dragging his mother onto the street , begging : ‘ can i go with my @entity234 ? ’ one of the gunmen took him aside , put his pistol to the teenager ’s temple and told him to ‘ f * * * off ’			0
he added : ‘ not long after she was taken , a local @entity7 man knocked on the door and handed @entity234 ’s purse and wedding ring to my sister			1
i knew then she had n’t just been murdered but executed			0
we found out she had been taken to a beach , had her hands tied , was knocked to the ground beside what would be her own grave and shot in the head			0
’ the @entity7 immediately imposed a menacing omerta among the @entity10 community			2
to talk of @entity19 ’s fate was to invite a visit from a death squad			1
’ when , 30 years after her abduction , the @entity7 admitted they had killed mrs @entity19 , exhaustive searches found no body			1
then , in august 2003 , walkers stumbled upon her remains buried on @entity268 beach , @entity163			0
now , for @entity4 and his family , justice is at last in sight .			0
