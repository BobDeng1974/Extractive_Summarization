a woman whose fiancé passed away suddenly while at work has won a battle to be refunded the cost of the wedding dress she had ordered to wear during their nuptials			2
@entity9 , 44 , from @entity10 in @entity11 was left devastated when her factory worker boyfriend @entity12 , 34 , dropped dead of unknown causes in december			1
as @entity9 was too devastated with grief to contact the various wedding companies to start cancelling her plans for the big day , her daughter @entity14 took it upon herself to call the bridal shop where the dress had been ordered			2
@entity9 with a picture of her and her deceased fiancé @entity12 but according to @entity14 , staff at @entity24 in @entity25 said they were unable to refund the £ 1,200 deposit			1
@entity14 told @entity28 : ‘ they told her they could cancel the dress but the money would be held as a cancellation fee or they could carry on making it in case of a change of circumstances			0
‘ we could not believe what she was hearing , what was her fiancé going to do - come back from the dead ? ’ @entity14 then launched an online petition to get support for the deposit to be refunded , which attracted 6,000 signatures in the first day			1
after the store started to receive death threats to staff , they contacted the family to say that they would be refunding the deposit in full			2
@entity14 said : i ’m so pleased they agreed to pay the money but the whole family are still upset this was deal with so badly			0
’ bridal stores often have strict cancellation policies as many events can disrupt a wedding ( picture posed by model ) but the bridal store was forced to stump up the cash from their own tills though , as the designer who they had commissioned to make the dress had already started work on the garment and refused to hand back the money			1
@entity74 , managing director of @entity24 , told @entity75 : ‘ we are very sorry for her loss but we have to deal with emotional situations all the time and each situation is different			0
‘ we have people whose dad passes away or brides who are dying from ovarian cancer			0
‘ in my personal situation , i would love to give everyone their money back but i have to have a viable business to look after our existing brides , pay my staff wages at the end of the month and put a roof over my family ’s head			0
