court case : a female soldier , known only as @entity2 , is suing the @entity3 for their handling of her sexual assault claims a sailor is taking the @entity3 to court after she was sexually assaulted by a @entity10 soldier in @entity11 while they both stood guard over a terrorist			1
the woman , who is in her 20s , had her breasts fondled and was subjected to lewd demands for sex during the 12 - hour ordeal , which left her ‘ disgusted and terrified ’			1
the incident happened after she was posted to @entity21 to watch over @entity22 , a rogue @entity11 policeman who turned his gun on three @entity10 soldiers , killing them in july 2012			1
last night , the woman , an @entity26 who can be identified only as @entity2 , revealed how corporal @entity27 made unwanted sexual advances towards her as they stood guard in the compound ’s hospital , where the injured @entity33 terrorist had been taken			1
she said : ‘ he groped my breast and i slapped his hand away			2
he said he could not help himself			0
he said he had cheated on his previous girlfriend and had a high sex drive , needing to have sex three to four times a day			1
‘ he also suggested we went on a midnight run together and have sex in a military container			2
i felt trapped because i could not leave my post			0
’ she added : ‘ in a war zone and while we were guarding a significant terrorist , he fondled my breasts			2
' to be sexually harassed and felt up by a more senior member of @entity48 , while guarding a notorious suspect , was shocking and traumatic			0
’ she is bringing a compensation claim for sexual harassment and sex discrimination at an employment tribunal in @entity55			2
the @entity3 is defending the case , saying she did not properly comply with the military complaints procedure before issuing her claim			1
under military rules , service personnel can bring a compensation claim only after they have exhausted the internal grievance process			0
attack : the @entity21 checkpoint where three soldiers died in 2012 ms @entity2 ’s original complaint led to @entity68 being tried by a court martial for sexual assault			1
although he pleaded not guilty , he was convicted and sentenced in june last year to 120 days ’ detention and demoted two ranks to @entity74			0
at an appeal hearing last august his sentence was reduced to 30 days ’ detention and demotion by one rank to @entity80			0
victim : @entity2 was standing guard over a terrorist who killed three soldiers , including warrant officer @entity85 , pictured but ms @entity2 , who returned to @entity10 at the end of her posting in august 2012 , claims she was not properly supported after the assault , which left her feeling ‘ very vulnerable ’			1
in a statement submitted to an employment tribunal , she said : ‘ the next day , i reported the sexual assault to my superior			2
but @entity68 was not moved from his station so i was very afraid to have to work in relatively close proximity to him			0
’ she added : ‘ they prosecuted him , but forgot about me			0
i never felt listened to			0
they still see staff who complain about the conduct of an officer as being the problem unless you accept their outcome			0
' they do not have a victim - centred approach			0
’ her lawyers say the legal action is a test case that will reveal how the military has closed ranks on sexual harassment by denying complainants the right to take their cases to civil courts			0
her solicitor , @entity122 , of @entity123 , said he believes there are ‘ dozens ’ of other cases that have been suppressed through @entity3 internal grievance rules			1
an @entity3 report in 2012 found all of the 400 female soldiers questioned claimed to have experienced ‘ unwanted sexual attention ’			1
