by @entity0 published : 21:28 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 5 january 2013 the @entity1 has been accused of fostering a ' macho ' culture after interviewing fewer women experts on its news programmes than rival broadcasters			1
radio 4 's today programme invited an average of five male experts for every woman in november , while the @entity12 featured more men by a ratio of four to one			1
by comparison , @entity16 's @entity15 had a ratio of three to one in favour of male guests and @entity22 achieved parity on nearly half of its broadcasts			1
researchers from @entity28 in @entity29 counted the number of male and female experts invited onto news programmes for ten months last year			1
under fire : today has been criticised for having a disproportionate amount of male guests critics have accused the corporation of failing to make enough effort to book women on its programmes			1
in november , the today programme came under fire for inviting only male experts for a discussion of breast cancer			1
at one point , presenter @entity46 even asked a male contributor to imagine he was a woman			2
the programme has also been criticised for relying on male journalists			1
of its five regular presenters , just one , @entity52 , is a woman			0
@entity55 , who won an ageism case against the @entity1 last year after she was dropped as a @entity58 presenter , said : ' the @entity1 newsrooms are quite macho , in that there are more male producers than women			1
' but they need to make an effort to change their ways			2
if other broadcasters can improve , i do n't see why the @entity1 ca n't do better			2
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' everyone can agree there should be better gender balance in the media but , like all broadcasters , we have to reflect the world as it is			2
' it 's a fact there are fewer women than men at senior levels in business , politics and world @entity85 is bound to be reflected in our output but we are aiming to increase the number of female contributors across @entity90 and we are making headway			0
' we feel this relatively small snapshot does n’t represent the range of well - known female presenters and correspondents that work across @entity90 but nonetheless it continues to be a priority for us to improve the representation of women on our programmes			0
' @entity28 ’s director of broadcasting @entity100 , who conducted the research , said the results were ' dire ’			0
call for change : @entity55 , who won an ageism cases against @entity1 , said its newsrooms are ' macho ' she said : ' the @entity107 has been the worst performer at all			0
its ratio of male to female guests is terrible			0
there have been no recent signs of change on this issue by the @entity1			0
' they do n’t seem to be taking it seriously at all , whereas other broadcasters cave certainly improved over the year			0
the @entity1 should be ashamed of itself			0
' when women are invited on the @entity1 they tend to be the victims of diseases or crimes rather than authority figures			1
on hard news stories about the economy or politics , the @entity1 resorts to men			1
' but this is not because women are not interested in appearing on tv or be interviewed on the radio , or because there are not enough female experts			2
' it is a matter of making an effort to change the same old faces and bring in new talent			0
