@entity0 have begun preparing for a huge courtroom battle amid fears of a £ 50m fine next season			2
on the eve of their @entity10 play - off final clash against @entity9 , it can be revealed the @entity5 club have started seeking legal advice over their breach of the @entity15 ’s @entity14 regulations			1
in march , the club posted a staggering £ 65.4m loss for the year ending may 2013			1
but more worryingly , under the same guidelines , @entity0 could face a fine of up to £ 50m even if they are promoted this summer			2
the club will not face sanctions for their financial footing during the 2012 - 13 season - but will for the current campaign			0
rangers do not have to reveal those figures until december - but given they recorded a £ 65.4m loss , it seems hugely unlikely that they ’ll be able to reel in their deficit to the £ 8m threshold			1
and it is understood the club have opened dialogue with their lawyers as they plot a way to fight against the prospect of a financially crippling fine			0
settling it the @entity32 way : @entity17 and @entity0 face @entity31 's @entity9 in the play - off final multi-millionaire businessman @entity22 ’ arrival at the club in august 2011 heralded a period of heavy spending at @entity5			1
but the arrival of big money signings such as @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 have not resulted in success on the pitch			0
and the club ’s relegation from the @entity72 last season has left them facing financial meltdown .			0
