@entity1 serial killer @entity0 , who killed 17 women in the early 1970s and 80s			1
he died in prison last month aged 75 the remains of an unidentified victim of an @entity1 serial killer who hunted down his victims as if they were game have been exhumed in a bid to establish who she was			1
@entity0 confessed to killing 17 women in the 1970s and early 80s and after the murder 30 years ago , led authorities to her body near a lake in the north of @entity19			1
however , she was never identified and @entity0 died last month aged 75 , while serving a 461 - year sentence in @entity1			1
now her body has been exhumed from from the cemetery at @entity24 with the hope that dna testing and facial reconstruction will lead to her being identified			1
the woman , who was believed to in her late teens was found on april 25 , 1984 , near @entity31			1
this led to her becoming known by many as ' @entity34 ' within the state 's medical examiner 's office			2
the work is being paid for by the @entity39 and a former forensic anthropologist for the @entity41 is working for the center on the case			0
@entity44 , operations administrator for the state medical examiner 's office said : ' we know what happened to her			0
' we 're not trying to solve the crime			0
we just want her to be identified			0
' mr @entity44 said the woman was among cases of unidentified and missing people that were being reviewed by the center , with authorities receiving permission for the exhumation , the day before @entity0 died			1
the date on her grave marker is april 24 , 1984 , one day off the date the body was found			2
but that 's not the only discrepancy , another @entity0 victim , @entity67 , reportedly also was found near the same lake on the same day , but mr @entity44 said @entity67 was found near another lake in 1985			1
@entity0 was convicted in 1984 after confessing to killing 17 women , mostly dancers and prostitutes , during a 12 - year span in the 1970s and 80s			1
he was convicted of just four of the murders in a deal that spared him having to go to trial 17 times			2
@entity0 was the subject of a 2013 film titled , ' @entity79 , ' which starred @entity80 as an @entity1 state trooper investigating the slayings , with actor @entity83 portraying @entity0			2
@entity0 owned a bakery in a downtown mini mall and lived across town with his wife and children , who knew nothing of his double life			2
he would abduct the women and take them to remote places outside the city , sometimes driving them and other times he would fly his private plane			0
the identity of one of his victims , who was found near @entity99 north of @entity19 has never been established and now her remains are being exhumed investigators have said that in some instances @entity0 would rape the women but return them to @entity19 , warning them not to contact authorities			1
other times , he would let the women go free in the wilderness and then hunt them with his rifle			0
in june 1983 , one of his victims , @entity109 , managed to escape his car as he loaded his plane to take her to his cabin			0
he had already tortured and raped her , and she was still handcuffed when she ran from his car to flag down passing traffic			0
she described the kidnapper and his plane to authorities , but when police questioned him , he had an alibi and a gentle demeanor , so they let him go			0
but after some bodies were found by hunters in the area , investigators re-visited suspects and realized he fit the profile			0
his alibi - two friends - also admitted they had been lying			0
they searched his plane , home and car and found he had some items , including jewelry , that had belonged to the women			2
only 12 bodies of the 17 women @entity0 confessed to killing have been found			1
the others were never located .			0

@entity0 confessed to killing woman over 30 years ago in @entity19
despite her remains being found , her identity was never established

body is now being exhumed to try and find out exactly who she was
*experts* hope dna testing and facial reconstruction will lead to her identity
