by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:32 pm on 9th december 2011 @entity2 is facing a mutiny from his own party after supporting @entity6 ’s decision to wield the veto			1
the deputy prime minister backed the prime minister ’s negotiating position after being telephoned by him in the early hours of yesterday to discuss the unfolding events			2
but mr @entity2 apparently believed the veto would not be necessary , as @entity13 and @entity14 would roll over and make concessions to @entity16 to maintain treaty change at the level of all 27 @entity20 countries			1
showing the strain : @entity2 ( right ) has come under fire from his own party after backing @entity6 's decision to veto the eurozone rescue package ( file picture ) in @entity26 's periphery ? mr @entity6 looks anxiously at @entity14 chancellor @entity27 at yesterday 's eurozone summit in @entity29 after wielding the veto the failure of the deal and use of the veto has left the overwhelmingly pro-eu @entity35 close to a state of crisis – with senior ministers said to be ‘ deeply concerned ’			1
they fear the @entity39 will be put under unprecedented strain and sources warned that any @entity42 moves to loosen ties with the @entity20 further would lead to open revolt among the @entity35 membership			2
former party leader @entity46 said : ‘ there will be a huge price to pay and , as a consequence , the foreign policy priorities of this country for the past 40 years has gone down the plughole in a single night			0
' that foreign policy has now been hijacked by the @entity54 in the @entity42 aided by a prime minister who was not prepared to stand up for the national interest			0
’ damning criticism : @entity35 peer @entity58 ( left ) said it was a ' black day for @entity16 and @entity26 ’ , while former party leader @entity46 ( right ) said there will be a ' huge price to pay ' further down the line he told the @entity64 : ‘ as a consequence we have lost control of the @entity26 agenda and the prime minister has lost control of the demands for a referendum			1
this has been @entity13 payback time for the way in which @entity6 went around @entity26 lecturing @entity74 on what to do			2
’ prominent @entity35 peer @entity58 , a close political ally of the business secretary @entity76 , described the summit outcome as ‘ a black day for @entity16 and @entity26 ’			1
he said : ‘ we are now in the waiting room while critical decisions are being taken			0
with the western economies and our banking system on the edge of a cliff , we should not be putting special pleading for special interests in the @entity86 above our vital national interest of working closely together with @entity14 and @entity13 to keep our economy and jobs all over @entity16 safe			0
’ @entity90 , chairman of the @entity35 parliamentary party , said it was unclear why mr @entity2 had agreed to the decision			2
she said : ‘ i gather @entity6 phoned our illustrious leader before he decided to do this			0
there must have been reasons			0
i do n’t see them at the moment			0
’ @entity35 mp @entity99 said the @entity16 was facing a ‘ worst - case scenario ’ of isolation in @entity26			1
mr @entity99 said the result was not the ‘ ideal outcome from a @entity35 point of view ’			2
labour leader @entity105 has accused @entity6 of leaving @entity16 ' on the sidelines of @entity26 ' furious : mr @entity105 , a staunch pro-european , said mr @entity6 caved into the demands of @entity42 eurosceptics but he blamed @entity54 for pushing the prime minister into a corner			1
he added : ‘ it will make it more difficult for us to exercise the kind of influence that we all want over the future of the @entity26 single market and the future of the @entity26 economy			0
’ @entity35 mep @entity122 accused the government of adopting a ‘ xenophobic ’ approach to @entity26			1
‘ far from keeping @entity16 strong , @entity6 has ensured that we will lose our influence at the top table , ’ he said			1
‘ by seeking to protect bankers from regulation , he has betrayed @entity16 ’s real interests and done nothing in practice to help the @entity86			0
‘ the fear now must be that we will increasingly lose the opportunity to affect decisions being taken that are bound to affect us			0
’ fellow mep @entity136 warned the @entity16 face ‘ revenge attacks ’ from the rest of @entity26			1
she said : ‘ there is already mood music within the parliament that if the @entity16 wants it some people will take a great deal of satisfaction in making sure we do n’t have it			0
’ by contrast , mr @entity6 ’s position in his own party has been greatly strengthened – though he will now face renewed demands for a referendum as the other members of the @entity20 forge a fiscal union			1
@entity155 leader @entity154 said it was tempting to say well done to mr @entity6 , but insisted he had ' gained nothing ' @entity159 mayor @entity158 – who piled pressure on mr @entity6 in the run - up to the summit , and has been increasingly touted as a leadership rival – said : ‘ @entity6 has played a blinder and he has done the only thing that was really open to him to do			0
’ eurosceptic mps cheered the result – but made it clear that they would step up the pressure on mr @entity6 at @entity171 to go further in distancing @entity16 from the heart of the new @entity26 project			1
@entity42 mp @entity174 , who quit the government over @entity26 in october , hailed mr @entity6 ’s stance as a ‘ paradigm shift in our relationship with the @entity20 ’ , which made a referendum more likely			1
temporary truce : @entity158 , increasingly touted as a leadership rival , said mr @entity6 had ' played a blinder ' he added : ‘ there is going to be inevitable pressure for further repatriation of substantial powers , and people may well be asked before the end of this parliament for their view on an in - or - out referendum			0
’ the leading @entity194 @entity193 said the decision to wield the veto was a ‘ historic moment for @entity26			2
he added : ‘ we are now embarked on a very serious , responsible path towards renegotiating the whole of our treaty relationship			0
