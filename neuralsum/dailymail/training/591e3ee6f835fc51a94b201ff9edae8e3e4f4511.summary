making a case : @entity5 is urging @entity7 to consider the nuances surrounding @entity2 's @entity14 membership family affair : the partners of both @entity5 and @entity7 chuckle as they join in on the official visit @entity64 received : @entity5 signs the official guest book as @entity7 looks on mr @entity15 indicated that mrs @entity7 is prepared to give some ground on @entity2 demands for reform because she is keen for the @entity2 to stay in the @entity14			1

earlier this week , mr @entity5 said @entity2 voters ’ support for @entity14 membership was ‘ wafer - thin ’ and that the @entity14 ‘ sometimes overreached itself with directives and interventions and interference ’			1

@entity114 , of the @entity115 which wants to renegotiate @entity2 ’s relationship with the @entity14 , said mr @entity5 will seek a deal			2

i think @entity5 has been and will continue to be , so i think we are in a very good place			0

the invitation is a coup for @entity5 and one more step towards the @entity2 gaining some powers back from @entity48
