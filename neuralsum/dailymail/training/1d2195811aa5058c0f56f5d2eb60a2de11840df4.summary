struggling to get the kids to eat their five - a - day ? scientists may well have invented a novel solution that will certainly provide a small boost to their intake - chocolate made with fruit juice			1
and it is better for their waistline too , as the tiny droplets of juice - apple , orange and cranberry - are used to replace up to half of the bar 's fat content			1
the technique works with all types of chocolate , dark , milk , and white , but does give the final product a fruity flavour , the researchers have admitted			1
fruity flavour : scientists have developed chocolate bars with half the fat that count as one of your five a day - because they have fruit juice droplets but there is the option to use a mixture of water and vitamin c instead of fruit juice in a bid to maintain a more chocolatey taste			1
the technique , developed by a team at the @entity38 , substitute the cocoa butter and milk fats that go into conventional bars with liquid in the form of micro-bubbles			2
this helps the chocolate retain a velvety ' mouth - feel ' - firm and snappy to the bite and yet melt in the mouth			2
speaking about the technique at national meeting of the @entity54 in @entity55 , lead researcher dr @entity51 said : ' we have established the chemistry that 's a starting point for healthier chocolate confectionary			0
' this approach maintains the things that make chocolate " chocolatey " , but with fruit juice instead of fat			2
now we 're hoping the food industry will take the next steps and use the technology to make tasty , lower - fat chocolate bars and other candy			1
' he added : ' everyone loves chocolate - but unfortunately we all know that many chocolate bars are high in fat			1
' however it 's the fat that gives chocolate all the indulgent sensations that people crave - the silky smooth texture and the way it melts in the mouth but still has a " snap " to it when you break it with your hand			0
' the process also prevents the unappetizing white film that coats the surface of chocolate that has been on the shelf for a while			0
a two - ounce ( 57g ) serving of premium dark chocolate may contain up to 13g of fat , around 20 per cent of the an individual 's daily fat intake , with much being the unhealthier saturated variety			0
but although high in fat and sugar , chocolate does have high levels of healthful plant - based substances known as antioxidants or flavonoids			0
and substituting fruit juice could also reduce the overall sugar content of the confectionary			0
the team used fruit juices and other food - approved ingredients to form a @entity114 - a method which prevents the small droplets from merging with each other			0
dr @entity51 said : ' since the juice is spread out in the chocolate , it does n't overpower the taste of the chocolate			2
we believe that the technology adds an interesting twist to the range of chocolate confectionary products available			0
' the opportunity to replace part of the fat matrix with water - based juice droplets allows for greater flexibility and tailoring of both the overall fat and sugar content			1

@entity138 , orange and cranberry juice droplets replace half the fat content in the chocolate
bars have the same velvety feel as normal bars but a fruity taste , @entity38 researchers say
