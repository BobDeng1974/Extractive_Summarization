by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 01:37 est , 19 october 2012 crime is at its lowest for almost a quarter of a century , according to police figures			1
there were 3.9million crimes recorded in @entity6 and @entity7 in the past year , the lowest since 1989 , statistics revealed yesterday			1
total crime has fallen by around a third in a decade , from its peak in the mid- 1990s , and by 6 per cent in the past 12 months			1
' welcome news ' : the latest statistics , compiled using both crimes recorded by police and the @entity14 , show a decrease in the number of offences over the past decade only pickpocketing and other personal thefts were up , by 6 per cent , continuing a rise which began three years ago			1
criminologists added a note of caution , warning the official figures were under - counting certain types of crime , such as card fraud			1
estimates of violent crime are now at around half the level seen in 1995 , according to the @entity14 of @entity6 and @entity7 due to the way crime is recorded , the worst incidents of civil unrest in @entity6 in recent memory barely registered in the figures			1
dr @entity37 , of the @entity39 think - tank , said : ‘ we are entitled to be a little bit suspicious about such a major fall			2
they do not count each victim of card fraud as a victim , but individual banks			0
i think there ’s an awful lot more fraud than is contained within the figures			2
crime stats no longer cover all the main types of crime that are going on			0
’ but he said high prison population numbers meant many of the repeat criminals ‘ who need to be in prison are there ’ and this would have a downward impact on crime figures			2
the statistics for the 12 months to june this year show that police - recorded burglary was down 6 per cent , robbery 7 per cent and violent attacks 6 per cent			1
criminal damage was down 12 per cent , firearms offences 18 per cent and car theft 14 per cent			1
homicide was down 14 per cent			2
there was further good news from the @entity74 , also published yesterday			0
according to ministers , it suggested that members of the public were ‘ less likely to be a victim of crime than at any time since 1981 ’			0
based on interviews with 40,000 people about their experiences of crime in the past year , it suggested crime was at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981 , with 10million offences recorded – half the level seen in 1995			1
while the latest figures indicate that overall levels of crime are falling , they show that pick - pocketing increased over the past year the falls showed that cuts to police red tape were freeing up officers , said crime prevention minister @entity99			1
' crime has been falling for 20 years now			0
we welcome this of course , but we know from the thousands of victims we ’ve helped in the last month alone that crime is a real problem for a lot of people ' @entity109 chief executive he added : ‘ police reform is working			2
we have swept away central targets and reduced bureaucracy			0
this shows that how the police are deployed , rather than their absolute numbers , is what is key to cutting crime			0
’ the falls have come despite sharp cuts in government funding for the police , which will fall by a fifth in the five years to 2015			0
@entity124 chief executive @entity123 said : ‘ crime has been falling for 20 years now			0
we welcome this of course , but we know from the thousands of victims we ’ve helped in the last month alone that crime is a real problem for a lot of people			0

number of crimes recorded by police forces in @entity6 and @entity7 dropped
it fell to 3.9million offences in the year to june - a third lower than in *2002/3*
figures show murders , *attempted* murders , and violent crimes are all down
but pick - pocketing is on the increase with a 6 per cent rise over the last year
