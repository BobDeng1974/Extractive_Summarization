@entity0 was dismissed from the touchline in the final seconds of the first leg , a stormy goalless draw in @entity13 's @entity12			1
he hoped it would not incur a ban , since it was at the very end of the match , he apologised immediately and his disciplinary record has been good , but @entity19 have confirmed that the automatic one - ban suspension will stand			1
trouble : @entity1 manager @entity0 ( right ) has been handed a minimum one - game suspension by @entity19 you 're off ! @entity0 was sent to the stands as his side drew 0 - 0 with @entity4 in their @entity8 play - off their @entity26 will decide on the full extent of the final sanction when they meet next week			1
it comes as a considerable blow for @entity1 as @entity0 is such an influential figure during games , constantly on the touchline , directing his players and motivating			2
the former @entity37 and @entity38 defender became agitated during the second half as tackles started to fly in from both teams and @entity42 was sent off for two yellow cards			0
missing : @entity0 , who will watch his side from the stands at the @entity45 next week , talks with ref @entity47 still friends : @entity0 ( right ) admits he apologised to @entity4 boss @entity49 ( left ) after being sent off he was warned by the @entity51 referee @entity47 but continued to berate the fourth official and exploded furiously when the game was halted with @entity1 on the attack so that @entity55 could receive treatment after being hit by the ball			1
after the game , @entity0 said : ' i have apologised			2
it was a big game for us , right			0
i just was n't happy with some of the decisions			0
after the game i apologised to the referee and to mr @entity49			0
no hard feelings or whatever			0
' maybe i over-reacted in that situation when he stopped the game when the ball hit @entity55 in the stomach and we were in a good position , two against one ... but nothing serious happened in that moment or after the game			0
