new clerk : @entity1 , who runs the @entity2 in @entity3 , was headhunted for the @entity5 role @entity6 is being urged by @entity7 to block the appointment of an @entity10 woman as the next ‘ chief executive ’ of the @entity12			1
@entity1 , who currently runs the @entity2 in @entity3 , has won the battle to become the new £ 200,000 clerk of the @entity12 – despite claims that her selection amounts to nothing more than ‘ political correctness ’ by speaker @entity19			1
ms @entity1 – privately dubbed ‘ @entity21 ’ by critics of her selection – was chosen by a panel chaired by mr @entity19 after being tapped up by headhunters and flown to the @entity5 at taxpayers ’ expense			1
under normal circumstances it would now be a formality for the prime minister to formally recommend her to the @entity30 as the next clerk			0
but @entity33 mps , who complain that the ‘ best candidate ’ for the job , the current deputy clerk @entity34 , has been unfairly passed over , have urged mr @entity6 to ‘ pause ’ the process			1
last night @entity33 mp @entity39 said : ‘ given that there was an in - house candidate who was eminently qualified to do the job , this is bizarre			2
‘ if this is @entity19 ’s idea of political correctness – to have a woman – then it ’s absolutely staggering			1
’ he was backed by fellow @entity33 mp @entity48 , who said : ‘ ms @entity49 undoubtedly has her merits and i have no reason to doubt she has performed her very different role as head of the staff of the @entity10 @entity57 in an exemplary way			2
‘ but i know my colleagues are very concerned that the role of the @entity61 , one of the most important and powerful officials in @entity57 , should not be pushed through without the proper consultation and scrutiny of @entity7			0
’ mr @entity48 added : ‘ i believe the prime minister might wish to at least pause the process while the @entity68 is n’t in session so that he can hear the views and concerns of mps from across the @entity68 before fundamental and probably irreversible changes are made			0
' politically correct ' : some @entity33 mps implied that ms @entity1 was chosen instead of the @entity5 favourite because she is a woman ‘ it is important that any notable reform is made with the widest possible consent			1
’ ms @entity1 , who will replace the popular bewhiskered figure of sir @entity80 as clerk , is also entitled to a five - bedroom grace - and - favour house in @entity83 as part of her employment package			2
one @entity12 source said : ‘ she is a radical break with the past , a proper chief executive figure who enjoys hard rock and modern art – not playing the church organ in @entity92 like sir @entity80			0
’ the speaker ’s office last night declined to comment			0
but a source close to mr @entity19 insisted the decision was taken by the whole panel , saying : ‘ it was a consensus decision			0

@entity1 , who runs a @entity102 *department* in @entity3 , won job
£ 200,000 clerk of the @entity12 role has a favourite based in the @entity5
but ms @entity1 was headhunted and flown to the @entity5 at taxpayers ' expense
@entity33 mps have implied she is not suited for the role
one said speaker @entity19 ' chose her *due* to political correctness '
