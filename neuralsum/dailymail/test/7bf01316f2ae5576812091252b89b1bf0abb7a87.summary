' @entity50 , @entity49 , met @entity3 on wednesday 8 october 2014 , the day after the incident , to discuss the matter in full			0
' @entity3 gave his account of the incident and @entity50 clearly outlined the processes we follow when an investigation is under way , which is consistent in every case of discrimination we are involved in , throughout the meeting			0
' during the discussion , @entity50 offered the support of @entity24 to @entity3 , as we do with every complainant we are in touch with , and they both agreed to a follow - up meeting			2

' @entity3 , who has said in the past that the @entity26 and @entity24 need to step aside and let a ' new and younger generation ' combat racism , welcomed the court verdict but remained critical of the support he had received during the process			2
' this is a sign of progress for everyone , not just people with colour , ' @entity3 , who has played for @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , wrote on his @entity116 account			2
' while this progression is in society i sincerely pray and hope that these so called anti-racism ( groups ) will one day actually do what they say they will and support and treat every player no matter what league they are in as equals , instead of this constant lip service that they continue to provide			0
