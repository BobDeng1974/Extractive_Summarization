by @entity0 when you 're thinking about where to do your shopping for the perfect summer wardrobe your local supermarket probably wo n't pop into your head			2
but @entity0 has found that this summer you can forget your usual ports of call on the @entity10 and head down to @entity11 's , @entity12 and @entity13 for some stylish - and cheaper - alternatives			1
co.uk you might instantly head to @entity19 or @entity20 if you need a frock for a wedding or special occasion			2
but since @entity11 ’s doubled its design team on own - label @entity26 last year , and invested heavily in fabrics and workmanship , they ’ve become a real alternative to the @entity10			1
fresh designs , such as this floral frock , are perfect for summer weddings or formal events			2
the hour - glass style flatters curves , while the tailored pleat gives you a neat silhouette			1
shoes , £ 25 , and dress , £ 25 , @entity41 forget more expensive shoes at old reliables such as @entity44 or @entity45 ; @entity12 is giving them a run for their money			1
at the last count , the supermarket ’s @entity50 range had more than 350 shoe styles available to buy online , though the choice in store is understandably smaller			2
shoes come in sizes 3 to 8 and they are always comfortable , often with padded soles and ankle straps			2
they also have a choice of brands other than their own , including @entity64 and @entity65			2
this pair costs £ 25 , but the zip detail and chain trim makes them look far more expensive			2
drop - waist dress , £ 16 , and shoes , £ 25 , asda.com @entity72 and @entity73 are renowned for interpreting high fashion			1
but did you know @entity13 , too , has become adept at churning out catwalk copies at the drop of a hat ? it has even had its own catwalk show in one of its @entity83 stores			1
among the clothes was this drop - waist dress that ’s not dissimilar to @entity87 ’s ‘ blanket dress ’			1
hers costs £ 855 , but this can be yours for £ 16			0
better yet , it ’s far easier to wear than the billowing original , thanks to the clever cut			0
coat , £ 28 , shirt , £ 6 , skirt , £ 10 and shoes , £ 16 , asda.com when you have to buy an outfit for the office workwear , take a minute before rushing out to give your credit card a bashing at @entity103 or @entity104 — @entity13 has a great line which is unbelievably cheap			1
its best - selling £ 6 white shirt is crisp and well - tailored and it does wonderfully tapered trousers , also £ 6			1
this white coat is a useful summer cover - up and looks like it means business			1
a stretchy midi - length skirt is another great option			1
the perfect length , so you do n’t scare your boss , and comfy enough to sit in all day at your desk , it comes in a variety of prints and flatters curves			0
sweater , £ 55 , skirt , £ 20 , and shoes , £ 19.50 , @entity41 if you ’re hunting for knitwear , head to @entity50 , rather than your usual ports of call such as @entity127 or @entity128			0
it ’s the only supermarket that stocks cashmere all year round			1
this coral v - neck is 100 per cent cashmere and is fantastic value			1
a similar jumper at @entity128 will set you back £ 99			0
it ’s soft and fluffy , is n’t prone to sagging or bobbling and can be washed on a delicate machine cycle			0
@entity140 dress , £ 35 , and shoes , £ 20 , @entity41 have a figure outside the norm and think you ’ll never get a supermarket to tailor for you ? you ’d be wrong			0
@entity50 is your new best friend , as it caters comprehensively for all figures with dedicated tall , plus - size and petite ranges			2
it ensures its key pieces — like this monochrome tea dress — are manufactured in all three categories , as well as the standard size			0
this ‘ petite ’ dress has a higher waistband and shorter hem			0
curvy options have a more generous cut , and tall makes sure there ’s enough fabric to cover those long legs			0
figure fixing at @entity11 dress , £ 40 , shoes , £ 16 , sainsburys - live - well - for-less			1
co.uk women desperate to nip in their figures might head to @entity164 or @entity165 for some chic tailoring			0
but try @entity11 ’s instead — it has the best figure - fixing clothing			1
the secret is in the super-sharp designs			0
take this dress , which has a robust integral control slip to smooth the stomach and streamline thighs			0
it ’s reminiscent of designer @entity176 ’s hourglass frocks — but it ’s only £ 40			0
and do n’t stop at the dresses			0
a pair of @entity11 ’s skinny jeans , £ 14 , are sold every second			1
@entity182 , £ 8 , briefs , £ 4 , asda.com if you instinctively head to @entity128 for everyday undies — and a mid-range designer like @entity187 for something a little more special — you now have a supermarket alternative : @entity13			1
one of the hidden gems of the lingerie world , its underwear costs peanuts			0
the pieces fit well , but still look feminine with lace edges and detailing			0
it also has a t - shirt bra — one of their bestsellers — that costs just £ 4			2
and the detail on these pleated chiffon briefs makes them a dead ringer for one of @entity187 ’s designs .			0

@entity11 's doubled its design team on own - label @entity26 last year
@entity12 is giving @entity44 and @entity212 a run for their money
