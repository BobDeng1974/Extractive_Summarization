this adorable set of images shows a group of playful bear cubs frolicking in the trees as their mother takes a well - earned nap			1
@entity8 photographer @entity7 , 44 , snapped the brown bears chasing each other up tall pine trees , completely unaware they were being watched down the lens of a camera			1
at just a few months old , the youngsters were already able to climb right to the top of the tallest tree in the great @entity18 wilderness , in @entity19			1
meanwhile an exhausted mother bear snoozed on the ground below - and from the pictures of her offspring it is plain to see why she needs the rest			1
@entity28 : one of the bear cubs is bathed in golden light as it pokes its head out from behind a pine tree in the wilderness of @entity18 , @entity19 race you to the top ! @entity8 photographer @entity7 captured the cubs , who are just a few months old , dashing to the top of a tree taking a well - earned nap : while the cubs clambered up the tall trees their mother took the chance to get some sleep mr @entity7 , who has spent four seasons with the bears , saw them racing up the trees and hanging on to branches			1
the photographer , from @entity50 , hid in the woods so he could catch the bears in their most natural form			2
he said : ' it was an amazing sight to see the cubs climbing the tree			2
' they have amazing climbing skills even at such a young age			0
' they are utterly fearless			0
' the 39 stone ( 250kg ) mother looks at ease while resting because the wilderness , which borders @entity64 , is a safe - haven for bears			2
please let me sleep : the bears ' mother is woken up as her boisterous children start play - fighting at the bottom of the trees look at me mum : one of the playful cubs looks down at its mother and the other bears as it hauls its way up a tree up close and personal : mr @entity7 , from @entity50 , hid in the woods all day to take the perfect pictures of the bears in their natural environment more than 95 per cent of @entity18 is wild forest , meaning the bears have very little contact with people			1
mr @entity7 said : ' at last light a cub climbed up a tree in shadow			0
' further up , the tree was still bathed in beautiful light			0
i encouraged him like something out of a bear version of @entity94			2
' just as the cub reached the patch of light he decided to come back down again			0
only for the cub to change his mind again and shin up the tree again into the most beautiful patch of red light			0
' i could have hugged the little fellow had it not been for his 250kg mother watching close by			0
