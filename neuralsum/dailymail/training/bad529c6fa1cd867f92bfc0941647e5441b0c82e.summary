’ it was alleged that as police tried to put @entity12 into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck prosecutor @entity136 said : ' some of the officers suffered very significant injuries indeed , all the result of this defendant ’s violence			1
' it was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives			1
' one officer pc @entity149 tried to pin him down with a riot shield but @entity12 managed to straddle him and stabbed the officer in the stomach , it was said			1
as another officer pc @entity154 tried to restrain him , he too fell to the floor and @entity12 , it was said , slashed him across the left side of his face from temple to ear with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth			1
he then stabbed @entity164 in the upper and lower arm exposing the muscle and tendons of the arm as other officers struck him with their batons with no effect , it was claimed			0
as they did this @entity12 lashed out twice cutting across pc @entity176 ’s knee causing a 15 cm wound , mr @entity173 said			2
the @entity33 heard ' despite his continued violence , officers were able to pin the defendant against the meat display counter , with his head forced downwards			2
' before launching his alleged attack , @entity12 went into a butcher 's shop where he took a fillet knife , it was claimed in court but as they tried to cuff him , @entity12 attempted to stab pc @entity190 in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists and the blade stopped just millimetres away			1
prosecutor @entity136 said : ' the scene was a dreadful one - officers very badly injured , some critically so and blood everywhere from their injuries , with police and ambulance personnel doing what they could to give first aid to the officers before they were rushed to hospital			2
' uninjured officers succeeded in handcuffing the defendant , placing him in leg restraints and he was taken to a police van			2
' three officers remained in the back of the van to ensure both the safety of the defendant and to control him			0
he continued to be violent and aggressive even when restrained			0
' @entity12 was on bail when he went on the rampage and ' it demonstrates how his hostility towards the police was not something that arose just on the morning of 19th november			1
' it will become plain during the evidence that the defendant was in a disturbed state of mind at the time			0
in the months that followed he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia			0
' but he added @entity12 had the intention to kill the police officers as he had ' called out that he wanted to kill the police who were there , and threatened to do so , ' and ' he hoped that the police whom he had injured were going to die			1
' his actions were of course determined , dreadful and carried out in real anger , directed at the officers who were trying to detain him			0
‘ @entity12 denies assault causing actual bodily harm to pc @entity101 in an earlier attack in @entity243 on october 9 , and also denies the attempted murder of pcs @entity149 , @entity154 , @entity246 and @entity247 and alternative counts of wounding each with intent			1
