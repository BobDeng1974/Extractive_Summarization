by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 08:47 est , 4 july 2013 from ice cream vans to hot rods , speedboats and horses , teenagers heading to their school prom are no longer happy to settle for a lift in the family car , as these incredible pictures show			1
with the end of the annual round of exams upon us , teenagers all over the country are celebrating the end of revision and swotting with glamorous @entity19 - style balls			2
but it seems even the humble limousine is no longer enough for pupils at one @entity24 school who came up with some impressively elaborate ways of arriving in style			2
mr @entity29 anyone ? pupils @entity30 and @entity32 , both 16 , arrive at the @entity34 school prom at @entity35 in @entity36 , inside an an ice cream van @entity38 : while @entity30 , and @entity32 's ice cream van might not have been the most luxurious mode of transport in sight , it was certainly the most colourful the name 's boat , @entity46 : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity51 arrive in their 007 themed speedboat would q approve ? the boat , the provocatively named @entity55 , was towed to the prom on a trailer - possibly not quite as @entity58 would have planned it saddle up ! students @entity60 , 16 , and @entity61 , 15 , arrive at the @entity34 school prom by more traditional means courtesy of a pair of dapple grey horses saving the pennies : these teenagers arrived crammed into the back of a farm @entity70 and squeezed onto their family 's sit - on lawnmower last year , a pair of girls studying at @entity34 in @entity36 , @entity24 made headlines after they arrived as @entity77 dolls inside a perfectly - packaged display box and it would appear that this year 's crop of 16 - year - olds are just as fond of the limelight			1
among pupils set on making a splash at their prom were those who turned up on horseback , in vintage cars , a speedboad that played the @entity88 theme and a @entity90 - style trike			1
arriving in the speedboat , the aptly named @entity55 , was @entity47 , 16 , from @entity92 , who was accompanied by her friends @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity51			0
she said : ' last year some a couple of people turned up dressed as @entity77 inside a box , so we wanted to do something memorable as well			1
' we thought outside the box and thought a speed boat would be quite a cool idea , so we borrowed one from a friend			0
we arrived with a @entity88 playlist on in the background , with the songs from @entity107 and @entity108			0
' everyone seemed to react well to it and it was a really good night			0
' others plumped for a pair of dapple grey horses and a vintage campervan , while some called on their parents to fund grand entrances made in luxury sports cars			2
not everyone went crazy with the parental credit card however			0
four boys arrived squeezed into the back of a battered farmyard @entity70 , while another pair chose to make an entrance on the family sit - on lawnmower			1
art teacher @entity128 , 25 , who organised the prom at @entity34 in @entity36 , @entity24 , said : ' it [ the flamboyant display ] seems to be part of it now			2
' what they arrive in and how they dress is what the kids get excited about			0
they try and out - do each other , but they all looked great and had a great time			0
' the big event : the students ' prom night included supper and a disco in @entity146 close to @entity34 where they took their gcses dramatic : one student plumped for a violet and cream vintage car complete with a pair of yellow eyes for their grand entrance at their school 's prom night luxury : this couple managed to get their hands on a vintage van , complete with a suited and booted chauffeur and an assistant to open the doors slick : @entity166 and @entity167 , both 16 , got a lift in the parental @entity169 to the prom while others cadged a ride in the family @entity173 easy rider : this young chap chanelled his inner @entity176 and cadged a lift on the back of his father 's electric blue hot rod motorcycle going for glamour : this elegant young couple hoped their vintage car would ooze @entity186 but were foiled by the @entity187 lookalike behind them unconventional : these girls plumped for a vintage duck egg blue camper van festooned with pretty ribbons and bows vrrrrroooom ! @entity193 , 16 , and @entity194 , 17 , decided to take a slightly battered looking hot rod rally car to their school prom in @entity24 proud : despite the large financial outlay required , parents congregated outside the prom to enjoy the sight of their colourfully dressed offspring and their lavish cars			1

pupils at @entity34 in @entity24 arrived at their prom in luxury cars , an ice cream van and even a speedboat
last year , two students made headlines when they dressed as @entity77 and arrived packaged in boxes for the prom
not everyone *indulged* : two boys arrived on a sit - on lawnmower and a group turned up in the back of a @entity70
