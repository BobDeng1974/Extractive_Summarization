by @entity0 the @entity2 fan who was caught on camera punching a woman in the face after sunday 's game against the @entity7 has been revealed as an ex-con who served three years in prison for the stabbing death of a 17 - year - old boy			1
@entity12 , 38 , a lifelong @entity2 fan , punched a small blond woman , square in the face during a post-match brawl			1
following a furor after it was posted on social media , investigations have revealed that @entity12 , then 17 , was convicted of criminally negligent homicide and sentenced to three years in jail for the stabbing death of @entity21 during a fight outside a pizzeria in @entity24 , @entity25 in 1992			1
' i am deeply sorry , ' @entity12 said at the time of his sentencing in 1995			1
' i can honestly say i never sought the confrontation , but when it came , i did what i had to do			2
' the father of the deceased told the @entity42 that @entity12 ' got off lightly ' for the stabbing of his son because @entity12 's father was a @entity56 police officer			1
' i wrote the judge a letter , that this guy is going to kill again , ' @entity57 , 80 , told the @entity42			0
' he killed for no reason			0
he went out of his way to get a knife to stab my son			0
my son was involved in a fist fight and he went out to get a knife and stabbed my son			0
they were the same age			0
they were the same size			0
he had no business killing my son			0
' dragged away : the man in the number 80 green jersey is already being removed from the brawl by another man angry : this blonde woman seen in the red and white jersey advances towards the @entity2 fan hit : the blonde woman reels back as she is punched in the face by the large man friends of @entity12 are quick to defend the bartender 's actions on sunday			1
' he would never go after anybody if there was n’t a reason , ' said @entity91 , 52			0
' it looks like the girl went after him , not the other way around			0
he would never hit a lady			0
' the video shows a large man wearing camouflage shorts and a @entity100 jersey being hauled away from the crowd by another man			2
a blond woman , who has been identified as @entity7 fan @entity104 by the @entity42 , advances towards him then reels back as she is punched squarely in the nose			1
the woman seems relatively unperturbed for someone who has just been punched by a man twice her size			1
she nonchalantly wipes her nose with her arm as the man who punched her is pulled away			2
two law enforcement sources told @entity114 @entity25 that they expect charges against @entity12 to be announced tuesday			1
it 's unclear what started the brawl , but a new rule that helped the @entity2 clinch the victory may have had something to do with it			1
according to @entity122 , the new rule stipulates that a player may not push a teammate into the opponent 's formation			2
the rule was brought to bear when @entity7 @entity127 pushed his teammate @entity128 forward in an attempt to block the kick			0
after @entity127 was penalized , the @entity2 got 15 yards closer and @entity131 made a 42 - yeard game - winning kick a @entity2 team spokesperson released a statement saying , ' we are aware of the situation , and we do not tolerate that behavior			1
parties involved were detained , and this matter is now in the hands of the @entity142			0
' hard hit : the force of the punch sends her staggering several feet backward recovering : the woman can be seen to the right of this frame rubbing her face with her arm the @entity151 spoke to @entity12 's mother , who says her son punched @entity154 to protect her			1
@entity155 was at the game with her son and daughter on sunday , in which the @entity2 bested the @entity7 30 - 27			1
' he ’s the victim , really , ' she told the @entity151 from her home			0
' he was just concerned for his mother and himself			0
' @entity155 says that from the beginning of the game she and her children were heckled by a group of @entity7 fans			2
those same fans , of whom @entity154 was one , allegedly set upon the @entity168 as they were leaving the stadium			0
' he was just hitting back to defend himself , ' she said			0
' it was n't done deliberately			0
if you see the video , they just went wild			0
' @entity155 told the @entity151 that when @entity154 left , she flicked blood - blood drawn by @entity12 - at her			1
@entity12 's @entity177 page features pictures of his beloved @entity2 - themed van , named the @entity33 , and and , interestingly , an anti-bullying slogan			1
the court of public opinion , however , seems to be weighed heavily against @entity12			2
' leave it to a @entity2 fan to punch a chick in the face after a game , ' wrote one			1
' you guys ca n’t handle a win ? ' ' the @entity2 exemplify dignity and class # @entity193 , ' tweeted another			2
