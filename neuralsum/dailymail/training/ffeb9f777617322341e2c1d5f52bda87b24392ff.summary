by @entity0 it is a tale of two phone firms			0
as @entity3 confirms it is laying off 18,000 workers , mainly in the mobile phone business it bought from @entity7 , @entity8 maker @entity7 has confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the @entity8 6			1
it comes as 4.7 - inch @entity8 production is expected to start next week , with the larger 5.5inch version set to start three weeks later			1
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity33 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity36 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity37 and to protects the phone 's camera			2
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity42 currently used in most high - end smartphones			1
the @entity44 said @entity7 had finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff			2
the latest report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger ' phablet ' sized @entity8 6 wo n't ship until 2015 , analyst believed the firm has hit problems manufacturing the handset 's case and screen , and would now only launch a 4.7inch version this year			1
the handset is expected to have a new ' indestructible ' sapphire glass screen			1
@entity60 securities analyst @entity59 said the problems were found while @entity33 produced the smaller handset , according to 9to5mac			0
' production bottlenecks on 4.7 - inch iphone 6 center on the yield rate of in - cell touch panel and metal casing , ' claims ' as in - cell touch panel becomes larger in size , the edge of the panel may become insensitive to touch			1
' meanwhile , under new manufacturing process for the @entity8 metal casing , color unevenness is an issue			2
' according to 9th5mac , @entity59 says that these problems become more complicated with the larger 5.5 - inch @entity8 6			1
' as these new concerns are coupled with earlier concerns about the production of sapphire displays for the larger device , the analyst believes that the 5.5 - inch @entity8 6 may not launch by the end of 2014 , or may launch after october in very limited quantities			1
' @entity59 also believes that @entity33 will cut the prices of the @entity37 and @entity86 alongside the launch of the 4.7 - inch @entity8			1
prolific @entity33 - tipster , @entity16 , has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible @entity33 lcd backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches ( 14cm )			2
the photos suggest @entity33 is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5 - inch phone previous leaks have claimed the handset will have a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire			1
a @entity101 videomaker claims to have acquired one of the screens - and has subjected it to a barrage of abuse , from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it			2
in the video , the screen emerges totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from @entity33			1
@entity115 , a popular @entity101 host claims to have got the screen from well known @entity33 leaker @entity16 , who recently made his own video showcasing the screen			2
models of the new @entity37 ( front ) and @entity86 ( back ) are on display at the @entity122 in @entity123			0
@entity59 also believes that @entity33 will cut the prices of the @entity37 and @entity86 alongside the launch of the 4.7 - inch @entity8			1
in the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen			0
' i slowly realized there is absolutely no way i can break this display under my own power , ' he said			0
' the worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much			0
' the glass is also extremely high - quality , @entity115 noted : ' there ’s absolutely no color shift while looking through the sapphire glass			1
' the @entity8 screen being repeatedly stabbed by a knife : the sapphire glass emerges unscathed from the video trial which also sees in being bent and scratched with keys it is claimed the screen is made from sapphire crystal			1
@entity33 already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the ' home ' button and camera lens in the @entity37 , but the rest of the current @entity8 front display is made of @entity42			1
the new glass display is ' paper thin , ' @entity115 said in his video			0
@entity115 shows his screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally , keeping with rumors that @entity33 will release two different - sized iphones this year : a 4.7 - inch model and 5.5 - inch one			1
reports @entity33 was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year , yet sources claimed at the time @entity33 found the technology ‘ infeasible			0
’ @entity115 standing on the screen and bending it			0
when released , it goes back it its normal shape , raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen			0
the screen is also shown being repeatedly stabbed by a knife - and emerging with no scratches this was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens			1
however , @entity33 recently announced plans to open a mineral plant in @entity184 with sapphire glass experts @entity185			1
the facility is expected to employ around 700 people to manufacture sapphire crystal and sapphire glass , and this technology could make its way onto the screens of the next @entity8			1
the screen is described as ' paper thin ' it also survives having keys scratched across its surface - a common problem for @entity8 owners in a statement about the announcement , @entity185 said : ‘ although the agreement does not guarantee volumes , it does require @entity206 to maintain a minimum level of capacity			1
’ while an @entity33 spokesman added : ' we are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in @entity184 , creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering , manufacturing and construction			0
‘ this new plant will make components for @entity33 products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from day one , as a result of the work we are doing with @entity224 to create green energy sources to power the facility			0
’ earlier this week @entity8 maker @entity7 revealed @entity33 's new @entity227 could be the first to be made using its ' robot army '			1
the firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and ceo @entity232 has revealed the robots , dubbed ' @entity234 ' , are in the final stages of testing			0
it is believed @entity7 will install 10,000 robots as a test			0
workers are seen inside a @entity7 factory in the township of @entity243 in the southern @entity245 province			2
the firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build @entity33 's latest @entity8			2
lines dedicated to @entity33 devices getting first priority , according to @entity251			0
it says @entity232 told a shareholder meeting that @entity33 would be the first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that its next product - the @entity8 6 - will be manufactured in this way			1
each $ 25,000 @entity257 can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year it has been claimed			0
@entity7 , which currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across @entity262			2
however , the firm 's robot initiative has been delayed since it was first announced in 2011			0
at the time , @entity232 said the company had about 10,000 units already in operation , a number that was supposed to rise to 300,000 in 2012 , then one million by 2014			0
however , the firm is also ramping up human workers for the @entity8 6 , with 100,00 being hired according to some reports			2
dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show @entity33 's @entity8			2
they all show a thin , curved device with distinctive white ' bars ' across the back			0
however , a @entity279 news agency has claimed that in fact , the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen .			0

5.5 - inch version *scheduled* for second week of *august*
@entity7 confirms hiring of 100k workers
recent video shows the 4.7inch handset 's sapphire glass screen being bent , twisted , scratched with keys and even stabbed with a knife
