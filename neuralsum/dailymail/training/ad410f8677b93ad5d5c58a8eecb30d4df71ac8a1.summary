by @entity0 published : 02:52 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 05:26 est , 11 october 2013 it 's a boy			1
these three little words , followed by a screeching cry were the most amazing sounds i have ever heard			1
it was all so different from the previous year , when those same three words were delivered by a midwife with a sadness and flatness no mother should ever have to hear			1
on september 11 , 2011 , i had gone into @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , thinking i was in labour			1
instead , my husband @entity17 and i were told our baby did n’t have a heartbeat			1
' two in my arms ' : @entity0 with her sons @entity23 and @entity25			1
her baby son was born after a stillbirth we returned to hospital the next day where i gave birth to our perfect baby , @entity32 , who weighed 9lbs 2oz , stillborn only five days before he was due to make his entrance into the world			1
we were given a memory box containing photos , footprints and a lock of his hair			1
precious mementoes , but not what any parent expects to be taking home from hospital			1
in the days that followed i did things i never thought i could possibly be capable of			2
i chose readings , flowers and music for my baby ’s funeral			2
i sat next to my husband with his tiny white coffin over our knees as we travelled to the crematorium , and held @entity17 ’s hand as he carried our boy down the aisle – he said i had carried @entity32 for nine months and he wanted to carry his son to his final resting place			1
after we lost @entity32 , we did beat ourselves up about what had caused this			1
after all , he was inside of me , why did n’t i manage to keep him safe ? the results of the post mortem examination showed he had somehow bled out into me , possibly through the umbilical cord			2
a random and cruel occurrence , like being struck by lightning , the consultant said			2
memories : two tiny footprints is all that @entity0 has left of her stillborn baby son @entity32 tragic : @entity0 says she will never forget her lost baby @entity32 and will always keep him in her heart importantly for us , though , it was no more likely to happen again than it had been the first time , and it was n’t something which would prevent us from having another child			1
we were very lucky to be given a cause of @entity32 ’s death , even if it was n’t a reason			1
more than half of stillbirths are unexplained			2
i do n’t think i could have coped with not knowing			2
having our son @entity23 , then 21 months , was a godsend			1
his cheeky and mischievous smile kept us going in the darkest of days , but i knew from the very beginning that the only way i would ever feel truly healed was to have another baby			2
being pregnant again was both amazing and terrifying in equal measure			2
at no point did i allow myself to believe there would be a baby at the end of it			2
each kick provided comfort , but every time baby was quiet for any length of time , i would start to panic that something was wrong			2
the day i found myself sitting on the couch at 8am drinking cold @entity106 while guzzling sugary sweets in an attempt to get baby to wake up and kick was the day i knew i had finally gone crazy ! as soon as i was pregnant again , my parents offered to pay for me to have the baby privately , but for me that was never an option			1
part of the healing process was to go back to that same hospital , but this time bring home a baby instead of a box of memories			2
the hospital staff were generally great , although early on i had a slight scare and phoned the hospital to ask if someone could check me over , just for some reassurance			2
the midwife i spoke to instead told me i should seek help for my anxiety issues , and that if she let me come in that day to hear the heartbeat , i would just end up wanting to come in every day			1
i complained , to both my consultant and to the head of midwifery , and from that point onwards the care i received was exemplary			2
my mum joked that they must have had a big flashing sign whenever i said my name to warn them to be nice ! i had extra scans for reassurance , which was great until one at 36 weeks which apparently showed the baby had not grown in two weeks			0
cute : @entity25 is the spitting image of his big brothers but @entity0 's third pregnancy was beset by worry all of a sudden the consultant was talking about giving me steroids for baby ’s lungs before inducing me right away			1
we had 20 minutes of complete panic before a second scan showed there were no problems and the first sonographer had simply made a huge error			0
my previous experience meant any joy in pregnancy had been cruelly snatched away from me			0
overhearing excited first - time mums chatting about nursery decoration or prams in the doctor ’s waiting room would make me wince			0
i was so jealous of their innocence about pregnancy and birth			0
on another occasion i snapped at my newly pregnant friend who was fretting about having had a few glasses of wine before she knew she was expecting			0
' look at me , ' i said			0
' i hardly drink , have never taken drugs or smoked and look what happened to me			0
' when you are pregnant , people ca n’t help but chat to you , always asking excitedly what baby number this would be			0
i ’ve still not quite worked out the right way to answer that one – i never wanted to say this would be my second baby , but equally did the woman behind the checkout in @entity188 really need to know i had a dead son ? help : @entity0 , pictured with husband @entity17 , says baby @entity25 has helped them overcome their loss political solution : should the prime minister , pictured visiting a maternity ward , do more to prevent stillbirths ? it was only the day before i was due to be induced last year , that i finally allowed myself to believe this might actually happen			1
these months of worry and stress might actually have been worth it			0
the induction process was long but once labour started , all of a sudden everything was in fast forward			0
barely 40 minutes after my waters had broken and in just three pushes , our third son @entity25 arrived safe and sound , on august 24 , weighing 6lbs 14oz			1
his arrival was so quick the midwife barely had time to get her gloves on before he burst into the world			0
i ca n’t describe how it felt holding him in my arms that first night			0
@entity25 was the spitting image of both his big brothers			0
the sheer ecstasy of finally having him here will stay with me forever , just as the aching sadness for the boy we could n’t bring home will never go away			0
women need to know they are receiving the best of care and attention at all times and the thought that some of the 17 stillbirths in @entity234 each day could be prevented is shocking			1
when i was pregnant with @entity32 i had various niggles and issues along the way – nothing major , but i did spend a few nights in hospital with pains and tightenings at around 36 weeks			1
during the ward round in the morning , a doctor told me : ' we ’re not going to do something to make your baby come early			0
if your baby comes now , it will have tubes and wires and be in special care			0
is that what you want ? ' mother 's instinct : @entity0 feels more attention needs to be paid to pregnant mothers ' concerns in fact , in all likelihood , had @entity32 been born then he would have been perfectly healthy			1
i mentioned this to my consultant after we lost @entity32 and asked what would have happened if i had stamped my feet and demanded something be done at that point			1
he said they would probably have given me an extra scan , which in my case would not have shown anything untoward and i would have been left thinking everything was fine			0
' trusting mother ’s instinct and encouraging women to pay close attention to their baby ’s movements is , in my opinion , probably a better course of action			1
' with hindsight the consultant was able to say the monitoring printouts of the early contractions i was having could have indicated the baby was showing some distress , but without knowing the eventual outcome , they looked like perfectly normal tracings			0
i do n’t know what the answer is – more scans or monitoring ? perhaps			0
but as my consultant told me , a scan is only a snapshot of one moment , and in the past when more regular monitoring was carried out in later stages of pregnancy , people were left falsely reassured as a result			0
trusting mother ’s instinct and encouraging women to pay close attention to their baby ’s movements is , in my opinion , probably a better course of action			1
since @entity25 arrived it is suddenly like everything is just a bit more right in the world			0
we were supposed to be a family of four , and now we are			0
bereaved parents often talk about things getting back to a ' new kind of normal ' and that is precisely how i feel			0
@entity25 is n’t a replacement for @entity32 but his arrival has helped to fill the gaping hole left by his death			1
and as for how many children i have ? i ’ve settled on an answer			0
i have two in my arms and one always in my heart .			0
