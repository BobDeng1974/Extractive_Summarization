@entity0 and rumored boyfriend @entity1 spotted together after watching the band @entity2 perform at @entity3 in @entity4 were a record company to write a job description for the next big thing in popular music , certain attributes would surely be high on the list			1
foremost among them , one suspects , would be a decent singing voice , the ability to dance and that elusive brand of charisma which draws crowds of infatuated fans			2
none of which @entity1 possesses			2
not that he will be the slightest bit concerned about it			2
because he has plenty of reasons for self - confidence			1
seventy million of them , in fact			1
that is the fortune the 31 - year - old pop leviathan has amassed since bursting onto the scene eight years ago			1
no mean feat for an introspective and , by his own admission , curmudgeonly son of a biochemist from the @entity33 who less than a decade ago was stacking supermarket shelves to make ends meet			1
to put it into perspective , his £ 70 million nest egg eclipses the fortunes of household names such as @entity42 and sir @entity43			1
yet walk into your local pub and it ’s a fair bet many people , unless they follow the charts , will never have heard of him			0
so how has a pasty - faced , gangly geek ( he ’s 6ft 5in ) , who decided early in his career to eschew personal publicity altogether , turned into the biggest pop star in @entity56 ? the numbers do n’t lie			1
his earning power is nothing short of breathtaking			0
last year alone he earned £ 45 million			1
for one night ’s work @entity62 - ing at a party in @entity65 , he was reportedly paid $ 1million			1
the year before he grossed £ 30 million , making him comfortably the best paid @entity62 on the planet , and in the same year his credibility was bolstered by an @entity68 for songwriter of the year			1
all of this has led to him being named the 21st most powerful celebrity on @entity73 ’s celebrity 100 , beating the likes of @entity75 , @entity76 and even @entity77			0
but the very word ‘ celebrity ’ flies in the face of everything @entity1 stands for			0
fans of @entity83 might remember the occasion , in 2009 , when the @entity85 invaded the show ’s stage during a performance by the lovably hopeless @entity90 twins , @entity91			0
holding a pineapple on his head , he bent over and pointed at his buttocks — a bizarre performance which he later explained was a protest against the ‘ frightening stranglehold that @entity76 has got over the entire music chart in the @entity56 at the moment ’			1
protesting about @entity83 ’s obsession with fame , he declared : ‘ i ’m not a celebrity			1
’ this underdog mentality undoubtedly stems from his background			0
he was born @entity1 in 1984 in @entity107			1
his father , @entity108 , now 72 , was the lead biochemist at the local hospital and his mother , @entity111 , 65 , had been an occupational therapist but became a full - time housewife after @entity1 was born			1
@entity62 @entity1 performs onstage in @entity114 , @entity115			1
in 2008 he stormed the stage at an @entity83 stage performance to protest what he called the programme 's obsession with fame two older siblings went on to become , respectively , an it expert and a marketing executive			1
@entity1 , however , was cut from a different cloth			0
as a teenager , he underwent a dance music epiphany while listening to the radio in his bedroom			1
but instead of heading out to pursue the rock’n’roll cliche in pubs and clubs , the cerebral young man shut himself in his bedroom , where he built his own studio and spent the next eight years honing the production skills which would make his fortune			1
soon his music making had become an obsession			1
he has said that he so rarely left his room that he experienced a personality change , becoming an anti-social electronic music geek , chained to a keyboard			1
@entity1 at the 2013 @entity68 held at the @entity143 , @entity144 there were stints in bands , but he made an awkward frontman , perpetually hiding behind an oversized pair of sunglasses and resolutely refusing to dance			0
nobody was surprised when he gave that up			0
there were some encouraging signs			0
an independent record label released a couple of his tunes on vinyl			0
but he earned more money from the job he took in a fish factory , as well as shelf stacking at @entity165 and @entity166			2
in 2003 , he took a leap of faith and moved to @entity144 in an attempt to ‘ make it ’			0
he did n’t , and was soon returning north with his tail between his legs			0
it was back in his bedroom studio that he recorded his first album , i created disco , by which time he had rechristened himself @entity1			0
his salvation , as with so many recent stars , came in the form of social media			2
@entity1 rapidly built a following for his music on @entity181 , which brought him to the attention of @entity184 publishing and later the @entity186 label			2
in the blink of an eye he was writing two of the tracks on @entity42 ’s comeback album , x. that same year , 2007 , he released his debut album , which went gold with more than 100,000 sales			0
almost by accident , @entity1 had found the solution to his problems : get somebody else , better looking , more famous and with a better voice , to sing his songs instead			0
so after i created disco , he packed up singing and retreated , gratefully , into the background			0
since that first collaboration he has worked with anyone and everyone in the business , from popstars @entity210 ( their 2011 smash hit @entity212 won him a @entity213 ) and @entity214 to the @entity56 superstar @entity215			2
even @entity216 owes her biggest hit to @entity1			0
along the way , he has released three more albums , all of which have been global smashes			0
two years ago , he surpassed @entity223 to become the first artist to score nine top - ten hits from a single album			1
after his @entity228 album ( pictured ) , he packed up singing and retreated , gratefully , into the background with such dizzying success it is impossible to keep a low profile for ever , and even @entity1 has been affected by the fame juggernaut			2
it began with a sequence of beautiful girlfriends			0
despite his ungainly appearance , he found himself squiring the @entity241 - @entity240 swimwear model @entity242			2
soon he was developing a reputation for becoming involved with his collaborators			0
@entity215 was an on - off dalliance for years , and he had a year - long relationship with singer @entity247 , which ended with a @entity250 argument			1
and while success had built @entity1 confidence , it did nothing to dampen his contrary nature			0
@entity250 spats ( he has 5.79 million followers ) have become his stock in trade			2
he has railed at unkind reviewers , ‘ rich kids ’ ruining the record industry , his tracks being sold for what he regards as derisory prices , and singers whom , he feels , do not treat his creations with sufficient respect			0
@entity1 had made a career working with some of the hottest stars in pop music , including @entity215 ( left ) and @entity210 ( right ) all of which paints a less than complimentary picture of a petulant star whose life has changed beyond recognition			1
earlier this year , he jettisoned another stunning model , the @entity240 @entity279 , in favour of the biggest prize of his dating career , @entity240 pop princess @entity0			2
miss @entity0 , a 25 - year - old global star who had the top - selling album of 2014 in the @entity240 , fits the 2015 vintage @entity1 to perfection — for since 2013 he ’s gone about reinventing himself from the ground up			2
no longer a the anorak - loving teenager from @entity107 , @entity1 owns an £ 11 million mansion in @entity287 that was the year he signed a deal to @entity62 at the @entity240 superclub @entity291 , taking up a residency in @entity293 and buying an £ 11 million mansion in @entity287			1
in less than a decade he has gone from a nondescript detached house on the @entity297 housing estate just outside @entity107 , to a mansion with ten bedrooms , 11 bathrooms , two swimming pools and a guesthouse so palatial it comes with its own private garage			1
such is his earning power , however , this is a drop in the ocean			0
last year , he became the first artist to have his music streamed over a billion times on the internet and , at the rate he is going , the @entity62 will have £ 250 million in the bank before he hits 40			1
the @entity291 gig alone earns him £ 200,000 a night , while he has been paid many millions more by brands who use his music in advertising campaigns			1
he has physically changed beyond recognition as well			0
his once pasty skin is tanned , while endless gym sessions have honed those spindly limbs to lean , muscled perfection			0
the chest is waxed , the hair and designer stubble coiffed daily by a personal groomer , the teeth whitened and straightened and his wardrobe overhauled by a stylist			0
the end result of all this has been a contract as the face and body of @entity335			0
no longer the self - conscious wallflower , he now poses in nothing but a pair of briefs without missing a beat			2
he became the biggest thing in music by stealth , but the days of @entity1 flying under the radar are a thing of the past .			2
