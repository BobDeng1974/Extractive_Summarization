by @entity0 last updated at 4:34 pm on 4th january 2012 @entity1 and @entity1 are expected to be given extra protection in prison amid fears of revenge attacks			1
the killers of @entity1 are thought to be likely targets for reprisals from ethnic minority inmates angered by the vile racist attitudes that emerged during the trial			1
it is likely they will serve their sentences in segregated wings alongside other ' vulnerable ' prisoners such as paedophiles who are also thought to be at risk of attack			2
@entity1 and @entity1 are likely to be given extra protection in prison amid fear of revenge attacks @entity1 and @entity1 will start serving their sentence at the category a @entity27 prison a legal expert told @entity29 : ' there is a general duty of care to ensure their safety ; how it is fulfilled is a matter for the prison governor			1
' but rule 45 is likely to come into play , under which they could be put in solitary confinement for their own protection			0
' precautions could include making them exercise on their own , and housing them in the hospital wing or another solitary wing			0
' there is a duty of care to take reasonable steps to keep them safe			0
' rule 45 ( formerly rule 43 ) , is the rule that allows the isolation of vulnerable prisoners in the interests of their own personal safety			0
the pair are likely to be kept in a segregated to wing to protect against revenge attacks the extra precautions - which will come at increased cost to the taxpayer - follow an attack on @entity1 in @entity27 , south @entity65 , while he was on remand awaiting trial			1
he was attacked by three black inmates just weeks after he was arrested for @entity1 ’s murder in september 2010			1
prison sources said the three men , thought to be @entity72 , beat @entity1 after he tried to ‘ throw his weight around ’ by using his family 's underworld reputation			1
the assault left him with problems to his hearing and throughout the trial he had to wear a special headset to follow the proceedings			0
it also saw extra protection placed on him at the prison and heightened fears that he and @entity1 will be ' marked men '			1
the need for extra protection is also triggered by the fact that the killers could seek compensation if an assault does take place			0
hiding : family or friends of the @entity1 family arrive at the @entity98 with their faces hidden behind scarves for the sentencing of @entity1 today one of @entity1 's associates makes an obscene gesture at our photographer it is feared ethnic minority prisoners will seek revenge for the death of @entity1 @entity1 could potentially bring legal action against prison authorities for failing in their ' duty of care ' towards him			1
following their convictions yesterday , the pair were taken to @entity27			1
they are likely to be transferred to category a prisons elsewhere in the country			0
guards are also likely to be told to keep a special watch on the pair to further minimise the danger that they face			0
@entity127 murderer @entity126 , who was slashed in the throat in 2010 in jail , attempted to sue authorities for £ 100,000 for failing to protect him			0
the @entity131 pays significant sums each year to injured prisoners			0
a @entity131 spokeswoman said inmates at risk were kept apart from other prisoners when necessary			0
it is not yet known if the two men convicted of the @entity1 murder will be seen as suicide risks			1
but @entity1 could yet see his sentence cut short			2
detectives believe he might seek a deal with prosecutors and finally come clean about who else was responsible for @entity1 ’s death			2
police believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic evidence in the @entity1 case , meaning their best chance of nailing the other gang members is if a new witness were to come forward , or @entity1 – long regarded as one of the ‘ weak links ’ in the mob – were to become a supergrass			2
it is understood the possibility of @entity1 co-operating has already been discussed informally by investigators			2
@entity1 's parents , @entity164 and @entity1 , arrive at the @entity98 for the sentencing of their son for the murder of @entity1 @entity168 had told the court during the trial that her son was at home at the time @entity1 was murdered			2
