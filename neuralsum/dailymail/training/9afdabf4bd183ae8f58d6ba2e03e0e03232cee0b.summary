the cleverest youngsters are as able as those in @entity5 and @entity6 at age ten			1
but they make much less progress while they are at secondary school , between the ages of 11 and 16			1
by the time they sit their gcse maths , the brightest @entity3 children are two years behind their counterparts in @entity5 and @entity6			1
the study also found that @entity3 ’s most able youngsters make less progress compared with an average score for those of similar abilities across all the 12 places studied : @entity29 , @entity6 , @entity5 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
the findings , from the @entity40 in @entity41 , will fuel growing concern that the country ’s cleverest children are being allowed to coast during secondary education instead of being stretched			2
sir @entity47 , @entity48 ’s chief inspector of schools , has already ordered a ‘ rapid response ’ survey of how state schools teach the most able youngsters			0
dr @entity54 and dr @entity55 analysed children ’s performance in maths tests set by the @entity59 and the @entity60			2
they studied the results of the @entity63 tests taken at ages nine / ten in 2003 and ages 13/14 in 2007 as well as the @entity59 test for pupils aged 15/16 in 2009			2
the study focused particularly on the scores of pupils in @entity3 relative to the ‘ tiger ’ economies of @entity5 and @entity6 , but also examined their performance relative to pupils in the other places			1
the difference in the progress of the highest achieving @entity3 pupils was most marked in comparison to the @entity80 places			1
by the time @entity3 students reach the age of 16 , they are two years behind their counterparts in the @entity10 the average scores for all of @entity3 ’s pupils remained broadly similar to those of the other countries between ages ten and 16			1
dr @entity54 , from the institute ’s department of quantitative social science , said : ‘ at the age of ten , the highest achieving children in @entity3 can match the highest achieving children in @entity5 and almost match the highest achieving children in @entity6			1
‘ but the highest achieving children aged 16 in @entity3 are about two years behind the highest achieving children in @entity6 and @entity5			1
‘ one reason might be that the curriculum does n’t stretch the highest achieving children enough in secondary school			0
’ another possible explanation for problems in maths is ‘ the widespread use of private tuition by @entity80 families for both remedial and enrichment purposes ’			0
the researchers say : ‘ this helps to boost the performance of all pupils , including those already performing well at school			0
in comparison , private tutoring in @entity3 is mainly undertaken by a relatively small selection of children from affluent backgrounds , often for remedial purposes			2
’ education secretary @entity122 launched a back to basics national curriculum where fractions will be introduced at an earlier age the researchers suggest that the state intervenes through ‘ enhanced tuition ’ and other schemes for children who excel at school			2
education minister @entity133 said the report was ‘ a damning indictment ’ of @entity137 ’s education record			0
‘ this government is clearing up @entity137 ’s mess , ’ she said			0
‘ our reforms will drive up standards so our pupils have a first - class education that matches the best in the world			0
’ education secretary @entity122 recently launched a new back to basics national curriculum , which sets out the topics teachers in @entity3 state schools should cover between the ages of five and 14			2
in maths , five - year - olds will be introduced to basic fractions such as recognising a half of a specified length			0
currently , fractions are only introduced around the age of seven			0
at secondary school , there will be a focus on the application of mathematical knowledge and skills to solve problems and better preparation for post 16 maths			0
personal finance will be covered in a new citizenship curriculum			0
meanwhile , government league tables published last month showed that out of 176,538 high - achieving pupils at primary school , more than half were never entered for gcses in five basic subject areas at @entity175 they were steered towards subjects seen as less rigorous			0
it means that more than six in ten pupils who were high - fliers in tests at 11 – 108,570 – finished compulsory education without achieving the @entity182 : c grades or better in @entity3 , maths , two sciences , a language and history or geography .			1

@entity3 children are on a par with those in @entity5 and @entity6 aged ten
but the cleverest are two years behind when they reach the age of 16
new findings also show pupils make less progress than children in @entity34 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity33 , @entity29 and @entity31
