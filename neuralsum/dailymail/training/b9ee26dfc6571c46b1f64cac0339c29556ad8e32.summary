by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 8 november 2013 a @entity2 company has manufactured and tested the world 's first 3d - printed metal gun			2
the weapon was made using a ' laser sintering process ' and powdered metals and based on a ' classic ' 1911 design			1
the 3d printing specialists behind the weapon claim it ' functions beautifully ' and has already handled 50 rounds of successful firing			1
the weapon was made using a ' laser sintering process ' and powdered metals			1
it is based on a ' classic ' 1911 design every part of the gun except for the springs is made with ' direct metal laser sintering , ' which makes metal parts from a 3d design by blasting powdered metal with a laser			1
the main body of the weapon is composed of 30 components made from stainless steel and an alloy called inconel as well as carbon fibre and a nylon hand grip			0
the company claims the metal laser sintering process it used is one of the most accurate additive manufacturing process available and that the @entity15 printed parts have more detail and are less porous than conventionally made components			1
the company 's ' gun expert ' has fired 50 rounds successfully so far using the @entity15 printed weapon , to prove the 3d printing technology 's durability and viability to be used in modern mass manufacturing of similar products the gun has been made by a specialist 3d printing firm based in @entity54 , @entity55 , which says : ' the successful production and functionality of the 1911 3d printed metal gun proves the viability of @entity15 for commercial applications			1
' while many people might find the prospect of being able to print metal guns frightening , the firm said what it is doing is perfectly legal			0
' in fact , as far as we know , we ’re the only @entity68 with a @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , said @entity70 , vice president of @entity15 at @entity14			0
every part of the gun except for the springs is made with ' direct metal laser sintering , ' which makes metal parts from a 3d design by blasting powdered metal with a laser the firm plans on using the technology to print parts for weapons			1
' now if a qualifying customer needs a unique gun part in five days , we can deliver , ' mr @entity70 said			0
the company chose the 1911 model because the design is in the public domain , which in theory means people with access to the 3d printed technology could make a similar weapon			2
the equipment needed to produce such a weapon costs around £ 529,000			0
however , the @entity14 said it has not developed the weapon as a cheaper and easier way of making guns , but wants to prove that 3d printing is a viable solution that can be used in modern manufacturing and is here to stay			1
the @entity15 printed gun barrel sees chamber pressures above 20,000 psi every time it is fired			0
the company said it developed the weapon to prove the reliability , accuracy and usability of metal 3d printing ' it ’s a common misconception that @entity15 is n’t accurate or strong enough , and we ’re working to change people ’s perspective , ' said mr @entity70			2
the @entity15 printed gun barrel sees chamber pressures above 20,000 psi ( pounds per square inch ) every time it is fired			0
mr @entity70 said : ' the whole concept of using a laser sintering process to @entity15 a metal gun revolves around proving the reliability , accuracy and usability of metal @entity15 as functional prototypes and end use products '			2
the pistol is first tested at a distance , before the gun expert fires it himself and proves the weapon is accurate and on a par with conventional weapons			0

the weapon was made using a ' laser sintering process ' and powdered metals and based on a ' classic ' 1911 design
@entity55 - based company @entity14 , claims the pistol ' handles beautifully ' and has already handled 50 rounds of successful firing
the company said it made the weapon to prove that 3d printing is a viable solution that can be used in modern manufacturing
