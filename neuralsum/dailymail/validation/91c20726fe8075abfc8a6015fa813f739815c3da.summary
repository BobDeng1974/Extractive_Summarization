events in @entity1 on sunday served as a jolting indication that @entity3 remain a work in progress and are running out of opportunities to establish momentum going into the @entity8			1
the @entity10 title is now @entity11 ’s to lose and it is @entity14 ’s team — on the back of 10 successive victories — who are emerging as @entity19 ’s primary challengers at the global showpiece on these shores later this year			1
on monday , 200 days before the tournament begins at @entity23 when the hosts confront @entity25 , @entity3 dropped a place to fourth in the @entity28 rankings , behind their @entity30 conquerors			1
@entity31 and his assistant coaches are running out of time to prepare for the @entity8 @entity31 and his assistant coaches have some key issues to address this week as they seek to orchestrate a prompt revival			2
first up , major tests are running out arguably , the really momentous occasions @entity3 need to sharpen preparations for the @entity8 have already passed			1
facing @entity11 on sunday was the last such encounter			1
the national team now have home games against @entity41 and @entity42 , who are in a state of near - disarray , which will not challenge them to the extent they were challenged in @entity48 and , especially , in @entity1			2
@entity3 's players look dejected after they conceded the opening try of the match against @entity11 @entity52 could n’t set the same authoritative tone as captain that he had in wins over @entity56 there are home - and - away clashes with the @entity60 in august but by the time @entity3 take on @entity11 the following month , both countries will be keeping their powder dry			1
there are also no short - cuts			0
@entity31 is attempting to fast - forward the evolution of a squad largely made up of young players			1
but what the defeat on sunday proved is the importance of nous and experience , which the @entity30 had in abundance			1
@entity3 have a glaring caps deficit against most of the leading nations and it is too late to rectify that			1
the coaches must hope their rookies learn fast			0
@entity31 struggled for nous and experience in the defeat to @entity11 as he fastracks a young @entity85 squad slow starts are another problem , with @entity3 falling behind in all three of their @entity10 matches this season			1
they were under siege early on in @entity1 and @entity48			0
fundamental errors keep occurring in the opening minutes which leave them playing catch - up			0
against @entity96 , they managed to do just that — impressively so — but @entity11 never let them back into it			2
@entity31 and his team will review the tone of their match build - ups to see if they can find a way of ensuring the players start at the right pitch of emotional intensity			0
decision - making under pressure has become a major issue			0
the men charged with steering the @entity113 ship struggled in @entity1			0
minds were scrambled and execution levels dipped			0
@entity52 takes on @entity116 during the @entity10 match between @entity11 and @entity3 the @entity3 players leave the field defeated following their loss to @entity11 at the @entity121 on sunday march 14 @entity3 v @entity41 ( @entity23 ) , @entity10 march 21 @entity3 v @entity42 ( @entity23 ) , @entity10 june deadline for confirmation of @entity8 training squad july training camp in @entity127 , @entity128 august 15 @entity3 v @entity42 ( @entity23 ) , @entity8 warm - up august 22 @entity42 v @entity3 ( tbc ) , @entity8 warm - up august 31 deadline for confirmation of 31 - man @entity8 squad september 5 @entity3 v @entity11 ( @entity23 ) , @entity8 warm - up september 18 @entity3 v @entity25 ( @entity23 ) , @entity8 @entity52 could n’t set the same authoritative tone as captain that he had in wins over @entity56 , @entity96 and @entity140 , while half - backs @entity141 and @entity142 were eclipsed by @entity143 and @entity144			1
@entity31 is reluctant to deploy @entity146 from the bench but he will be far more willing to turn to @entity148 when the injured @entity149 is available again			0
@entity11 ’s air and ground assault exposed @entity113 shortcomings , not just their aerial blitz , but also with their work at the breakdown			1
the visitors ’ kicking often lacked accuracy and threat , and they were beaten to the ball in the air far too often for comfort			0
that is a concern , given the prowess of @entity8 pool rivals @entity56 and @entity96 in that area			0
those nations also have the personnel to cause trouble at the ruck and @entity3 can not afford to regularly concede the initiative in the battle over the ball			2
they have predatory runners like @entity174 and @entity175 out wide , but without quick ball , they are hampered			0
as for selection conundrums , there were no hindsight - driven grumbles about the make - up of the team in @entity1 , it ’s just that the chosen men could n’t deliver			2
@entity184 of @entity185 is seen as the leading scrum - half in the country in terms of his tactical kicking game , so he may come into consideration for a starting place			2
@entity192 had a couple of costly lineout - throwing lapses but he has performed well enough to be given the benefit of the doubt at hooker			0
@entity192 had a couple of costly lineout - throwing lapses in the disappointing defeat to @entity11 @entity202 was less prominent than in the previous two matches and @entity204 will be back on the radar , as will another @entity206 forward , @entity207			1
meanwhile , @entity208 is likely to return at full - back against @entity41 if he is over his concussion			0
finally , there is the question of what to do with @entity214			0
there will soon come a time when @entity217 and his assistants have to confront the issue of what to do in midfield when the @entity224 centre is fit again			0
@entity174 has been a revelation in this championship but he could n’t force his way into the game on sunday , as the pack and inside backs were under the cosh			2
the coaches have suggested @entity214 could play at inside centre , but that does not appear to be a natural , instant solution and @entity3 ’s whole attacking approach will hinge on the balance of their selections at 12 and 13			1
@entity224 ’s wrecking - ball runner is a match - winner , but so is @entity174 and both are better in the thick of the action , rather than out wide			2
dejected @entity3 players @entity184 , @entity202 and @entity52 react to the @entity11 defeat			1

defeat to @entity11 reminded many that @entity3 are a work in progress
on monday @entity3 dropped a place to fourth in the @entity28 rankings
sunday 's loss means the @entity10 title is now @entity11 ’s to lose
@entity3 's young squad showed *numerous* signs of *inexperience*
