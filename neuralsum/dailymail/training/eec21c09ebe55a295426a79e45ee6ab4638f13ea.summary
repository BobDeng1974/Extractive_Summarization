there are numerous studies that attempt to rank countries based on economy and population , but few look at what these countries contribute to the rest of the world on an educational , cultural and humanitarian level			1
the @entity12 attempts to change that by highlighting the nations and regions that give the most in terms of peace , science and technology , climate and health			1
@entity22 tops the index ’s overall rankings - beating 124 countries to the accolade - and is also the highest ranking country in terms of prosperity - which factors in fair trading for example - and equality , according to the new research			1
explore the @entity12 rankings in the chart below the @entity12 is the brainchild of independent policy advisor @entity37			1
he used 35 datasets covering 125 countries to break the list into seven categories , including @entity42 , @entity43			1
' good ' is defined as ' a measure of how much a country contributes to the common good ' the @entity48 ranks highest for science and technological contributions , @entity47 tops the @entity52 list , and @entity53 was found to be the most cultural			1
elsewhere , @entity55 is top of the @entity43 list , which looked at charity giving and population growth , and @entity60 provides the most in terms of food and humanitarian aid			2
the @entity12 is the brainchild of independent policy advisor @entity37			2
he said he wanted to attempt to measure how much each country on @entity65 contributes to the planet and to the human race			2
@entity37 used 35 datasets , created by the @entity68 , @entity69 and other international agencies to track what countries offer , across seven categories			1
these include @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity75			0
these datasets were combined into a common measure to get an overall ranking , a ranking in each of the seven categories , and a balance - sheet for each country that shows at a glance how much it contributes to the world , and how much it takes away			1
more technically , countries received scores on each indicator as a fractional rank , relative to all countries for which data is available			0
the category rankings are based on the mean fractional ranks per category , and the overall rank was based on the average of the category ranks			0
only countries that were featured in the datasets were included , leaving a total of 125 countries , and the majority of data was taken from complete sets created in 2010			1
‘ the biggest challenges facing humanity today are global and borderless : climate change , economic crisis , terrorism , drug trafficking , slavery , pandemics , poverty and inequality , population growth , food and water shortages , energy , species loss , human rights , migration - the list goes on , ’ explained @entity37			2
‘ all of these problems stretch across national borders , so the only way they can be properly tackled is through international efforts			0
‘ the trouble is , most countries carry on behaving as if they were islands , focusing on developing domestic solutions to domestic problems			0
' we ’ll never get anywhere unless we start to change this habit			0
’ @entity22 tops the index 's overall rankings ( pictured far left ) - beating 124 countries to the accolade - and is also the highest ranking country when it comes to prosperity and equality			1
the numbers under the individual headings show where that country ranks within each category			0
for example , @entity22 is top overall , but 20th in terms of @entity150 , 33rd for @entity151 and 4th under @entity43 1			2
@entity53 @entity37 added that the @entity12 focuses more on what a country is doing , rather than its economic status and the researchers define ‘ good ’ in their study ‘ as a measure of how much a country contributes to the common good			1
’ in this context ‘ good ’ means the opposite of ‘ selfish ’ , not the opposite of ‘ bad ’ , and @entity37 claims ‘ the @entity12 is n’t trying to make any moral judgments : it just measures , as objectively as possible , what each country contributes to the common good , and what it takes away			1
’ @entity37 used 35 datasets , created by the @entity68 , @entity69 and other international agencies to track the way that most countries act , across seven categories			1

@entity37 said : ' the fact that domestic behaviour is n't included in the @entity12 of course does n't mean we excuse , condone , minimise or overlook it in any way : it 's simply not the thing that we 're measuring ' 1			2

‘ we tried a number of alternative ranking algorithms for these data , ’ said the researchers			0
' our method is simple to understand and something that was relatively insensitive to outliers			0
frankly the precise position of a country in a table does not matter that much			0
‘ what matters much more is each country ’s balance sheet and the gross positions in the table			2
countries in the top twenty are doing a lot for the common good			0
‘ those in the bottom twenty are hindering the common good , or at least are free - riders on other countries			0
countries in the middle are doing something in between			0
