by @entity0 published : 19:36 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 12:49 est , 9 january 2014 thigh society : this week , 58 - year - old @entity3 decided to wear a short skirt - and it looks wonderful long , shapely and with curves in all the right places , these are a pair of pins that any 20 - something would kill for			1
but allow your eye to drift a little further up and you 'll see this is no spring chicken			0
this is @entity3 , the 58 - year - old mother of our future @entity15			1
does n't she look wonderful ? @entity17 even			0
but what 's that ? too short a skirt for a woman of her vintage you say ? poppycock ! for as elegant women like @entity3 - and me - know , age need not rule out you modelling a short skirt			1
if you 've got legs as lovely as @entity3 's , it 's a sin not to show them off			1
in fact , i wear skirts shorter than her and i 'm six years older than she is			0
but , sadly , @entity3 's decision to wear a short skirt this week opened a rich seam of vitriol			1
if some of the insults i 've read online are anything to go by , older women who bare their legs do so at their peril , as poor @entity3 is discovering to her cost			1
from the she - should - put - them - away brigade to the nice - legs - shame - about - the - face crowd , that a-line skirt cut a mere two inches above her finely shaped knees has placed @entity3 firmly in the stocks			1
one @entity54 reader - @entity55 from @entity56 - said : ' this lady ought to dress with the appropriate decorum befitting her age ; after the age of 50 , ladies should wear clothes to the knee or just below			1
i am much more elegant , of a similar age and build and would never contemplate being seen in that apparel			2
what has happened to elegance and dignity ? ' and another reader was even more scathing , saying : ' this would not even look good on someone half her age			2
she is a deluded woman living in the past			0
but surely bruising commentary like this says more about the critics than its target			0
this extraordinary flowering of prejudice that blossoms whenever older women show off their legs is notable for two things - how often it happens and the depth of hypocrisy exposed			1
while younger women with terrible legs - and i 've seen some shockers , including 20 - somethings in tiny denim shorts exposing mountainous thighs bearing glaciers of cellulite - can run around baring all without as much as a raised eyebrow , things are very different for ladies like me			1
foxy lady : for elegant women like @entity3 , age need not rule out you modelling a short skirt any woman who reaches her 50s , however svelte or beguiling , seems to be precluded from even so much as suggesting a knee			1
what century do these people live in ? it would seem that young women inhabit a world of the @entity111 nude - coloured bikini exposing acres of flesh , while older women are expected to all but return to the @entity115 age , complete with floor - sweeping dresses to disguise any semblance of curve			1
the hypocrisy is particularly interesting since there is a constant and deafening chorus of complaints from women as they age that they become invisible			2
yet when a woman in her 50s dares to hint at her sex appeal , she is victimised			0
we should cheer her from the rooftops			0
why ? after all , sexuality is important to us all			0
granted , any sensible woman knows we ca n't hold on to the allure we had in our 20s and 30s , but turning 50 does n't mean we do not long for the turn of a head or a too - lingering glance			2
becoming a middle - aged woman does n't mean the glint in your eye is deadened for ever			2
certainly , at some point during these years , we hand over the torch of sexuality to our daughters , but still that does not mean we have to become sexually redundant			0
we can all see @entity3 is a vivacious woman			1
lucky @entity148 , i say			0
but as @entity3 is discovering to her cost , she is at a dangerous juncture in the evolution of her sexuality			2
i know - aged 64 , i 've been through those rocky years			2
every woman in her late 50s enjoys being admired , but you tread on a hair 's breadth of propriety			2
those who sashay into middle age are accused of being muttony ; those who surrender to middle age are accused of giving up			0
like daughter , like mother : @entity164 ( right ) and @entity3 showing off their equally toned legs as they go shopping but i believe @entity3 is neither			1
she is an unapologetic cheerleader for the elegant older lady who refuses to give in to convention			0
far from being denigrated , she should be applauded as a torchbearer for women who do not wish to define themselves by their birthdate			0
she is perennially well - appointed , well turned out and always appropriate			0
all of us who aspire to something other than a lifetime in midi - length skirts and bootleg trousers should cheer her			0
just because you can does n't mean you should ! @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 grandmother of a future king of @entity185 ? you ca n't buy class			0
@entity188 , @entity189 skirt length is far too short			2
seems the @entity3 ladies share a wardrobe ! @entity3 needs to go for softer colours and not try to dress as a 30 - year - old			1
@entity195 , @entity196 those tights are ridiculous on a woman of @entity3 's age			1
they scream : ' look at me , look at me ! ! ! ' @entity202 wearing such a short coat and skirt , how old does she think she is : 25 ? @entity205 , @entity206 the mother dresses younger than the daughters ! @entity209 mrs @entity3 's skirts are gradually getting shorter			1
@entity211 , @entity212 but at least she has one fan			0
fashion should be worn to suit the body , no matter what the age			2
an in shape and toned 58 - year - old looks much better in a short skirt with eye - catching , patterned tights and on - trend ankle boots than an out - of - shape 20 - year - old with no muscle tone would look in the same style			1
mrs @entity3 looks great ! @entity226 so why does her look work ? @entity3 follows the golden rule of short skirts : avoid nude tights			1
while her daughters @entity233 and @entity164 can certainly get away with flesh - coloured stockings , they 're a big no - no for women like @entity3			1
wearing short skirts with nude tights does not work for older women , however good our legs			2
it looks ageing and would show up all manner of thread veins and bumps on the upper leg if you got too close			0
so @entity3 's black patterned tights under a warm black coat allowed her to flawlessly dart about town while probably turning a few heads			1
what woman of any age will complain about that ? as i said , i am blessed with good legs and still wear short skirts , but with care			1
yes , i wear a skirt three or four inches above my knee , but only with tights that are patterned or 40 denier			0
when the weather heats up and i am forced into flesh - coloured tights to let my pins breathe , my skirt lengths descend to nearer the knee , just as @entity3 's do			1
too many inches of flesh - coloured thigh , however toned and slim , make the sheep start bleating			0
it screams that the wearer is trying to look young , as opposed to smart			0
surely this is what these bitchy commentators believe @entity3 is trying to be : youthful , rather than sprightly			2
but she 's not clinging to youth			0
she 's displaying her glamorous side			0
what 's wrong with that ? the prejudice that says an older woman ca n't display her legs , even if they are supermodel - worthy , is not just cruel , but way past its sell - by date			1
it is hypocritical to insist 50 - somethings are n't ' old ' then criticise them for not conforming to an old - fashioned stereotype			0
instead of denigrating and criticising women like @entity3 , we should get behind her			2
all power to those knees i say .			0

this week , the 58 - year - old stepped out in a short skirt
it 's not the first time , either ; @entity3 is partial to showing off her pins
her *sartorial* choices recently opened a rich seam of vitriol online
but if you have lovely legs , bare them no matter your age , urges 64 - year - old @entity306
