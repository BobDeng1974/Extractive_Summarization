@entity0 has revealed he will adopt the three - man central defence he used with @entity2 in the @entity3 over the course of the @entity6 season with @entity7			1
@entity9 ’s @entity7 team beat @entity10 7 - 0 at the @entity11 in @entity12 on thursday morning playing a 3 - 4 - 3 system alien to most fans of the @entity16 club			1
after the game the former @entity2 coach confirmed he will use that system in the @entity6 in order to get an extra centre forward on the field			2
he added that the squad he has inherited from @entity24 lacks balance			1
' but the boys are willing to pick up the information			0
' it is fantastic how they have performed today			0
' last week , 10 players who played tonight were not even in our training complex			0
' when you want to change a system , you must start at once			2
we do n’t have time to prepare for other things			0
' the other system they can play is 4 - 3 - 3 and they have played it for many years			1
' i can change back if the system does n’t work			0
with the quality of the players we have , i can play 4 - 3 - 3 with three strikers on the bench , but i want to play with two strikers			1
striking it rich : @entity26 ( centre ) and @entity59 ( right ) started up front together for @entity7 new system : @entity9 has vowed to play three at the back at @entity7 this season ' we have four no 10s , so the selection is not balanced in my eyes			1
' i have decided to play this system because of the quality of the players			2
' but if we lose , i can change back to another system			0
' @entity7 led 3 - 0 at half - time in their opening tour game and went on to score four more in the second half			1
@entity9 added : ' when you see us train , you can expect something but not 7 - 0			1
' it was a surprise , but they were also beautiful goals			0
new kid on the block : young wing back @entity81 ( second left ) scored twice in the second half ' it was not just the goals , but the beautiful attacks			0
' i never go back , i always want to see the future			0
' when i see my team playing a new system , it is better to win 7 - 0 than to lose because the players will then doubt the system			1
' but now i do n’t have that problem			0
' exceeding expectations : @entity9 said he was delighted with the performance and the result			2

@entity0 plays 3 - 4 - 3 as @entity7 thrash @entity10 7 - 0
@entity9 says he will *continue* with system so he can play two strikers
@entity9 *admits* squad he inherited from @entity24 lacked ' balance '
