by @entity0 last updated at 3:33 pm on 21st december 2011 a disabled dwarf who spent ten years in a wheelchair claims she has been miraculously ' healed ' by a church leader 's touch			1
@entity7 , 35 , was ' instantly cured ' of the pain in her legs that had left her unable to walk for a decade after reverend @entity10 placed his hands on her while she prayed to @entity12			1
she was wheeled into @entity13 ’s , an independent @entity15 church in @entity16 , @entity17 , before walking out unassisted just minutes later			1
miracle ? @entity7 ( right ) had been unable to walk for ten years before @entity19 ( left ) ' cured ' her by touching her legs as she prayed to @entity12 she said : ' i got up and walked and i ’ve continued to walk ever since			1
' ms @entity7 , who has dwarfism and is registered blind , has been unable to walk since she was 25 due to curvature of the spine			1
but despite doctors saying she would probably never walk again , she can now stroll to the local shops and hop on a bus to get around her hometown of @entity28			2
ms @entity7 , who is 4ft 7in tall , said her leg was twisted but has now started to straighten since the ' healing service ' in early october			1
she said : ' i did believe it would happen one day			2
' i was sat at the altar in the church and he laid hands on me , prayed , and said lift up your legs - and i could			2
' he was n’t expecting it and i certainly was n’t			2
i just said : " thank you , wow , that ’s amazing			2
" ' i went into the service with real pain but walked out with none			2
my body has just got stronger and stronger since then			0
' i ’m going for walks every day and feeling fitter than i have done for years			0
my doctors are amazed when i tell them how i was cured			0
' as she was : ms @entity7 had been confined to her wheelchair for ten years before her miraculous ' cure ' in october ms @entity7 has been a member of @entity13 ’s for a year and could previously only attend the church after being lifted into a special minibus to transport her there			1
father - of - four @entity54 said he was delighted ms @entity7 had been healed , but insisted that @entity12 should take the credit			1
he said : ' i am just a channel through which @entity12 is healing			0
i do n’t want to sensationalise it			0
i just want to carry out whatever work @entity12 wants me to do			0
' i remember @entity7 coming forward for prayer for her legs specifically and i laid hands on her in the set @entity65 tradition as we prayed			1
' i claimed her healing in the name of @entity69 and the pain simply left her and she could lift up her legs			0
her twisted leg began to slowly straighten over the next few days			0
' when we had finished she was really amazing and beaming			0
she could suddenly lift her legs up and her knees came right up to her chest , without any pain at all			0
' @entity77 is a professional psychotherapist having formerly been a aircraft engine fitter in the @entity79 , a salesman and debt counsellor before he was ' saved ' by @entity82 in his early thirties			0
he claims that since he was ordained in 2003 , two other people have reported being cured from their illnesses			1
the reverend said : ' a churchgoer with bowel cancer said she recovered after she attended one of my services and another said their years of back pain had completely gone			0
' now ms @entity7 , who has worked as an author and an actress , has one more ambition - to cure her failing eyesight			1
she is a struggling to raise funds for a pioneering eye operation in the @entity100 that costs over £ 10,000			0
meanwhile , she may attend another healing service at @entity13 ’s in the hope that it may ' cure ' her eyesight .			1
