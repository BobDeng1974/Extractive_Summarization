' the minister for immigration and border protection [ @entity52 ] has made a decision that your residence determination is no longer in the public interest , ' the letter reads			1
' as such the the @entity57 has exercised his public interest power ... to revoke your residence determination			1
' ms @entity31 said the boys had not broken any of the conditions of their community detention , which require them to attend school , abide by the law and not to make public comments and were given no reasons as to why their residence had been revoked			1
she described the boys as ' highly academic and focused on success , ' and said they would make ' incredibly loyal citizens '			1
when they received the letter , ms @entity31 said the boys were distressed and asked what they had done wrong , to which one of the officers replied : ' you have n't done anything wrong , this is just what the minister wants			0
' ' that 's the most distressing thing , they do n't understand what they 've done			0
a lot of them thought when they were placed in community detention , that meant they were worthy of getting a protection visa , ' said ms @entity31			2

@entity118 , national director of welcome to @entity13 , a not - for - profit that works with asylum seekers , says the way in which the boys ' removal had been conducted encouraged ' distrust , fear and suspicion '			1
' you ca n't say that it 's in the best interest of these kids to move them at 3 o'clock in the morning surrounded by four guards in two separate planes , ' he told @entity49			0
' i just imagine my kids in the same scenario and how i would want them to be treated			0
it 's not in a way that increases or even revisits the trauma they 've experienced in their home country or increases their distrust of authority , but in a way that upholds their dignity			0
