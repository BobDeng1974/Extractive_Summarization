by @entity0 published : 15:51 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 15:52 est , 14 november 2013 it 's a struggle for most to get a seat on the tube at rush hour , but an unlikely passenger managed just that this week			0
a ginger cat left commuters astounded when he boarded a @entity10 train and beat his fellow passengers to a seat			0
the tom travelled 10 stops , between @entity15 and @entity16 , before he was eventually coaxed into a cat carrier by a @entity19 , a volunteer from the nearby @entity20 who happened to be on the same train			1
unusual passenger : oyster the ginger cat travelled 10 stops on the @entity26 line this week - and even managed to get a seat stowaway : the cat boarded a @entity10 train ( file picture ) at @entity15 station the cat has since been taken in by the animal charity and named , rather fittingly , @entity34 - after the smartcard used to swipe in and out of the @entity3			1
@entity19 said : ' i could n’t believe my eyes when i saw @entity34 sitting on a seat on the @entity3 , and i thought at first he was a teddy bear			1
' everyone around him was just staring like they ’d never seen a cat before			0
no chip : the cat has now been taken in by @entity20 and will be rehomed if its owner is not found ' thankfully , i had a cat carrier with me as i had to pick my own cat up from the vets in the evening			1
' we both took the tube to @entity16 and i ’m very pleased i was there to help him get off the @entity3 , minding the gap , and escort him to @entity55			1
' @entity56 , @entity55 ’s head of cattery , said : ' oyster is very lucky to have been found on the tube by @entity19 who was able to bring him to @entity55			0
' we take in cats which have been found in appalling conditions in unusual places including bins and boxes , but @entity34 is a healthy , happy boy who appears to have been simply making his way to central @entity69			2
' @entity34 does n’t have a microchip , so if nobody comes forward to collect him , he will be rehomed and hopefully not try to take a trip on the tube by himself again			2
' @entity20 was originally founded in 1860 and started accepted cats in 1883			0
each year , the home takes care of more than 10,600 animals .			0
