@entity1 doctors are to give five women without wombs the ‘ miraculous ’ chance of giving birth to their own babies by 2017			1
they say the success of the world ’s first birth from a transplanted womb – announced by @entity12 medics on friday night – has opened the door for the revolutionary technique to take place in the @entity1			1
around 60 couples are now hoping @entity1 womb transplant pioneer @entity17 , who has spent two decades working on the project , will be able to make their dreams come true			1
however , funding problems mean only five of them will see it happen in the near future			0
the @entity12 baby boy was delivered by caesarean section last month by @entity38 , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at @entity42 ’s @entity41			1
the baby ’s mother , a 36 - year - old competitive athlete , was born without a uterus but had her own ovaries which produced healthy eggs			1
in 2012 , she received a uterus from a 61 - year - old family friend			1
this january , the younger woman was implanted with an embryo created from her own egg and sperm from her partner			0
although the baby was premature , he was perfectly healthy and discharged from hospital after ten days			2
prof @entity38 said it was ‘ still sinking in that we have actually done it ’			0
and mr @entity17 , who has worked closely with the @entity12 team , hailed the birth as ‘ wonderful news ’			1
he said : ‘ we have known for some time that it is possible to successfully transplant a womb			2
but the big unknown has been whether it is possible for that womb to safely carry a baby			2
now we know it can			0
’ he now hopes to secure approval from @entity1 ethics committees by next summer to perform womb transplants himself			1
after transplant , each woman would have to wait a year to ensure the womb was not rejected before being implanted with embryos			1
that would mean the first @entity1 womb transplant births could take place in 2017			1
mr @entity17 explained : ‘ because of what has happened in @entity12 , it ’s much more likely that an ethics committee would view our application favourably			2
‘ we have 60 women who want the procedure and there are at least two couples who have had embryos frozen in anticipation			1
women who want to have this done are keen to drive the process forward			2
’ but funding problems mean only five women are likely to benefit in the short term			0
while the £ 550,000 @entity12 programme – which has resulted in six viable pregnancies – has forged ahead thanks to a large research grant , @entity1 researchers have had to rattle tins			1
mr @entity17 ’s charity @entity104 @entity1 now has £ 40,000 – but that is well short of the £ 500,000 it needs to fund surgery and immunosuppressant drugs			2
a big difference between the two programmes is that prof @entity38 ’s approach has been to use living donors – including mothers , sisters , friends and even a mother - in - law – who volunteered to donate their wombs			1
@entity1 ethical boards see that as problematic , fearing those donating could suffer ill - effects in the process			1
mr @entity17 ’s team has therefore opted to take wombs from women on the donor register who have died young , employing the same principles and processes as used to retrieve donor hearts and lungs			2
mr @entity17 said that could change if it becomes clear the risks to living womb donors is minimal			0
he and his colleagues believe up to 15,000 women of child - bearing age in the @entity1 could benefit from womb transplants – either having been born without a uterus or having undergone a hysterectomy			1
hundreds opt for surrogacy every year and many more chose adoption			0
mr @entity17 added : ‘ given a choice , most women would rather carry and deliver their own baby			2
if you met the women who are born without wombs , or have had them removed , then you know what has driven me to work for 19 years on this			1
‘ these are people who have a deep need to have their own baby and deliver it themselves			0
’ @entity157 , who was born without a womb , with her her boyfriend @entity160 ' to feel our own baby growing ... it would be a gift ' @entity157 cried yesterday morning after hearing the news that , in a world first , a baby had been born to a woman who had undergone a womb transplant operation			1
‘ i was so emotional , ’ said miss @entity157 , who was a teenager when she found out she had been born without a womb			2
‘ the @entity12 birth is absolutely amazing			1
’ she now hopes to become one of five women in @entity1 chosen to receive a womb transplant herself			1
‘ to feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle , ’ she said			0
‘ it would be an absolute gift , the most amazing gift ever			0
’ she does not have a uterus because of a rare genetic condition called @entity184 syndrome , or @entity185 , which affects about one in 5,000 women			2
miss @entity157 , who will be 30 tomorrow , said : ‘ when i was 16 , i went to the doctor because i was not getting periods			0
i ended up seeing a gynaecologist and had an endoscopy , which revealed that i have no womb			0
‘ it was a surreal feeling to find that out			0
i obviously was n’t think about having children at the time – i was doing my gcses – and i do n’t think i really took it in			0
’ but as time passed , miss @entity157 , who lives in @entity199 with her 37 - year - old boyfriend @entity160 , a recruitment consultant , naturally thought more about having children			1
two years ago , she stumbled upon @entity17 ’s womb transplant programme while contacting surrogacy and adoption charities , offering to raise money by running the @entity207			0
as miss @entity157 has her own ovaries , the operation holds out the hope that she will now be able to bear her own child			0
‘ it was really , really exciting to find out that a womb transplant was finally a possibility , ’ she said			0
‘ we have all been waiting on the @entity12 programme			2
we have not known what to expect			0
when i was 16 , it was adoption or surrogacy and that was it			0
and now , 15 years down the line , there ’s the possibility that i will have a womb transplant myself , which is really incredible			0
‘ that miracle is now a step closer			0

five women born without wombs could give birth to own babies by 2017
comes after @entity12 boy became first to be born from transplanted womb
around 60 @entity1 couples are now hoping their dreams will come true
at least two couple have already frozen @entity242 embryos in preparation
@entity12 baby boy was delivered by caesarean section last month
mother was born without uterus but had ovaries which produced eggs
she received a uterus from a 61 - year - old family friend and had healthy baby
