prior to his arrest , @entity1 wrote to the @entity8 army chiefs on august 23 , 1966 , in a last - ditch attempt to convince them he could not be made to enrol because he was ' a minister of religion '			1
@entity1 had initially been called up to serve in 1964 aged 20 but his reading and writing was so poor he failed the qualifying test			0
soon after , however , the entry requirements were revised and @entity1 was classified as eligible for conscription but he flatly refused because war was against the teachings of @entity12			2
in his letter @entity1 urged general @entity38 and colonel @entity39 , directors of the conscription programme , to drop the charges against him claiming it was ' in the national interest '			0
knockout blow : @entity1 fighting @entity47 's @entity46 in august 6 1966 at @entity48			0
the fight was just weeks before @entity1 wrote the letter saying why he would not serve in @entity10 costly correspondence : @entity1 was fined $ 10,000 and handed a five - year jail sentence			1
he was also stripped of his heavyweight title and banned from boxing @entity1 wrote : ' i have filed with the @entity56 a written request to reopen my classification based on accompanying written information presenting facts not considered by the @entity56 or the @entity61 when i was classified which will prima facie justify a change in my classification to that of @entity67 , exempting me from all training and service as a minister of religion			1
' this petition is made to you in order to avoid injustice and unnecessary litigation in the courts which would be burdensome to both me and the @entity78			0
' with his letter he submitted 36 pages of ' documentary proof ' of his claim , stating the appeal was ' not made for the purpose of delay but in order that justice may be done ... ' ultimately , @entity1 's arguments fell on deaf ears and his application to be made exempt was denied			0
he was tried , found guilty of draft evasion , sentenced to five years in jail and fined $ 10,000			1
@entity1 appealed the conviction and spent the next three - and - a - half years talking at universities and @entity97 gatherings about his anti-war stance			2
in 1970 the @entity99 found that @entity1 qualified for conscientious objector status and his conviction was quashed			2
historic : experts say the six - page letter is the ' most significant @entity1 document in existence ' later that year @entity1 returned to boxing and in 1974 he gained his second world title , beating @entity109 in infamous @entity110			1
the signed six - page letter has been described as the most significant document relating to @entity1 in existence by experts			0
it is expected to sell for £ 35,000 when it goes under the hammer at @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 , on behalf of a private collector who bought it in 1997			0
prior to the sale it had been on display in the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128			0
a spokesman for the @entity118 said : ' it 's often said that time heals all wounds , and while the statement is belied by the physical toll @entity1 continues to pay for a decade and a half in the professional prize ring , perhaps no figure in @entity8 history has endured such a thorough transformation from pariah to national icon			0
ready to fight : @entity1 training at the @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144 , the same year as the letter was sent to general @entity38 and colonel @entity39 ' while the brash young fighter earned more than his share of detractors for the vocal self - aggrandisement that characterised his rise from 1960 olympic gold medallist to heavyweight champion of the world in 1964 , his refusal to accept @entity4 conscription added rocket fuel to that fire , inflaming the nationalistic ire of the @entity160 mainstream			1
' at the height of the @entity162 and the @entity163 , @entity1 suddenly found himself to be the most reviled @entity8 athlete since @entity164			0
' no item in the public realm speaks so directly to that transformative period in the life and career of @entity1 as does the presented six - page letter			0
gloves off : the famous letter cites other cases in order that ' justice may be done ' and demands @entity1 is not sent to war sign off : the document is signed as both @entity177 and @entity1 followed by the title of @entity179 , @entity180 ' @entity1 's draft status has been reclassified earlier in the year , and his appeal denied , actions that left him eligible for immediate induction			1
' the document survives in pristine condition without so much as a storage fold , the onion skin pages likely the @entity187 's personal carbon copy with the mailed copy still housed in government archives			0
' as we know , this last attempt for approval of conscientious objector status would fall on deaf ears , and @entity1 was arrested , found guilty of draft evasion , and stripped of his heavyweight title , the start of three and a half years of banishment from boxing			1
conscientious objector : the three - times heavyweight champion has been plagued by ill health in recent times			2
his letter is expected to attract much interest when it goes under the hammer in @entity119 later this month ' on june 28 , 1971 , the @entity99 voted unanimously to reverse @entity1 's conviction , with this letter serving as the basis for the @entity99 's decision			1
' three years later @entity1 would regain the @entity215 title with his historic underdog victory over @entity109 in @entity217 , completing his long and arduous climb back to the pinnacle of the sport			2
