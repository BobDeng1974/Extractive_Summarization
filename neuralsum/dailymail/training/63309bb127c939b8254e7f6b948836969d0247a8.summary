by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 19:00 est , 27 january 2014 viewers are used to @entity4 ’s sober presence on the nightly news			1
but they might be shocked if they knew what was going through his mind			0
the veteran @entity10 host has confessed he thinks of sex every time he meets a woman			2
and he says he likes to consider ‘ what could be ’ with his female friends and co-workers			0
insisting it is a ‘ natural animal element of sustaining life ’ for men to think of all women as potential sexual partners , he said being a man was ‘ all about women ’			1
' an interesting barrier ' : @entity4 said the urge to consider women potential partners is ' parked ' once you work together or become friends now married to a woman 27 years his junior , the 66 - year - old also opened up about his own romantic past , revealing he once had an affair with a librarian nearly twice his age while at sixth - form college			1
‘ sex comes into every evaluation of a woman , there ’s no doubt about it			2
it ’s there , ’ he said in a newspaper interview			0
‘ once you ’ve established a friendship or a working relationship with a woman , it ’s parked			2
but it ’s an interesting barrier			0
when you ’ve gone through it and arrived at the other side , it ’s never a problem again			0
‘ well i ’m not saying it is a problem at all , it ’s rather a delicious thing really , “ what might have been ” or “ what could be ”			0
’ @entity4 said he believed sex played a ‘ different role in different men ’s personas ’ , adding : ‘ we are defined by women : they give birth to us and then they define us , although lots try to ignore it			1
’ ' defined ' : @entity4 said that women are an inescapable influence on men 's personalities			1
he is pictured left with his wife , @entity70 , and right at a @entity73 ceremony in 2012 no doubt many men will agree with his frank analysis of the male psyche			0
but what the women in @entity4 ’s life will make of his comments can only be guessed at			1
as a tv news presenter he has worked alongside several well - known women , including former @entity84 anchor @entity83 , 66 , and former @entity10 reporter @entity85 , 45 , who quit in 2011 claiming that bosses had treated her in a sexist manner			2
among his current roster of co-hosts is presenter @entity90 , 39 , and the programme ’s social affairs editor @entity91			0
@entity4 has had an eventful romantic life			1
he was once briefly engaged to fellow @entity84 journalist @entity94 , 70 , and has two children with former partner @entity96 , 64			0
familiar face : @entity4 on @entity10 news and proving that age is no barrier to love , he married 39 - year - old @entity101 - born academic @entity70 in march 2010			1
@entity4 said her ‘ mental age ’ was far higher than his , saying : ‘ she ’s somewhere in her forties			1
she ’s very , very mature			0
i mean , she ’s a serious boffin			0
’ revealing he once had an affair with a much older librarian while a sixth - former at @entity107 , he said : ‘ i was warned off by my lecturer , who told me i was very unwise to be seen going off in the lunch hour in the librarian ’s car			1
’ the presenter made his comments to the @entity114 as he prepared to chair a debate on fatherhood			1
he insisted he was a strong supporter of women ’s equality in the workplace , but admitted he had not done as much as he could have to promote his female colleagues			2
he said : ‘ while i aspire to be a feminist , i think i am guilty of just as many failings in terms of supporting women ’s equality			2
i could n’t say i ’d really fought for women to enjoy many of the fantastic benefits i ’ve enjoyed			0

@entity4 said thinking of all women as potential partners is ' natural '
he also revealed that he had an affair with an older woman while a *student*
*ahead* of a debate on fatherhood he said being a man is ' all about women '
