by @entity0 published : 20:41 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 3 january 2013 @entity1 are to be offered ‘ bribes ’ of around £ 7,500 to slash the number of patients they send to accident and emergency			1
under a controversial bonus scheme that will hit the elderly particularly hard , they will be urged not to refer those with pneumonia , severe influenza or heart problems to hospital			1
patients and senior gps have labelled the scheme a ‘ perverse incentive ’ and an ‘ unethical waste of taxpayers ’ money ’			1
doctors will be offered financial incentives to reduce ' avoidable ' admissions to @entity24 @entity25 , chairman of the @entity27 ’s @entity1 ’ committee , said : ‘ i do n’t want a single patient walking into my surgery and saying my grandma ’s dead because you refused to admit her			1
so we ’re not going to admit people with pneumonia ? i think most doctors will be horrified by this			0
’ the scheme will be brought in across @entity38 this year by the @entity39 , which has been created to oversee gp services			2
as part of @entity44 health reforms , family doctors are in the process of setting up local clinical commissioning groups ( @entity46 ) to replace primary care trusts			0
each group will be set targets to improve patients ’ health and the overall quality of gp services			2
if these are met surgeries will be paid bonuses of £ 5 for every patient on their books , which works out at £ 30,000 for an average gp practice			0
but it has emerged that a quarter of this extra money – an average of £ 7,500 – will be based on gps reducing ‘ avoidable ’ admissions to @entity24			1
dr @entity25 , chairman of the @entity27 's @entity1 ' committee , labelled the scheme ' an unethical waste of taxpayer 's money ' from april , gps will be monitored for the numbers of patients they refer with pneumonia , severe flu , urinary infections and heart failure – which largely affect older people			1
the @entity39 claims that many such admissions are avoidable because patients could be looked after at home , or better cared for early on so they do n’t become so unwell in the first place			1
gps will be paid the money if they reduce these admissions or ensure they do n’t increase			1
they can then decide whether to plough it back into patient care or pay themselves and their staff a bonus			0
but dr @entity25 said : ‘ this is an inappropriate , unethical waste of taxpayers ’ money			1
patients might suspect that i was doing things to them in order that i would get money			2
i do n’t want to be paid because someone was admitted or not admitted , i want to be paid because i did my job			0
‘ i would n’t dream of participating in such a scheme			0
’ he said refusing to admit patients went completely against the @entity103 , which obliges doctors to carry out their duties ethically and responsibly			0
dr @entity106 , a gp based near @entity108 , @entity109 , said : ‘ it ’s a perverse incentive			0
i do not believe doctors should be given financial incentives not to refer or treat			0
a gp puts the person sitting in front of them as the priority			0
if they need to be referred , they are referred			0
’ @entity39 officials believe @entity1 should improve the care of the elderly and other patients with long - term conditions such as heart failure so they do not need to go to hospital			1
but gps point out that if patients develop pneumonia or suffer a severe angina attack they have no choice but to refer them			2
over the past six years , @entity1 ’ salaries have soared to £ 110,000 on average , even though they no longer have to work evenings and weekends .			2

@entity1 to be paid not to refer patients to @entity24 in bid to reduce admissions
controversial scheme could hit elderly the hardest
