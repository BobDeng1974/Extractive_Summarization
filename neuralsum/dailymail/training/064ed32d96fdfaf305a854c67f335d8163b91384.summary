anyone who still believes that the @entity1 is merely a distraction to a team ’s domestic campaign need look no further than @entity6 ’s passionate travelling contingent in @entity7 on thursday			1
huge numbers were being reported on @entity9 on wednesday morning , some claiming close to 20,000 away fans would be descending on the @entity13 city in anticipation of their team ’s @entity16 clash against 2011 @entity19 champions , @entity7			2
although the final figure may have been closer to 10,000 , there ’s no doubt that the flame of the @entity1 burns brightly on the blue side of @entity25 and that became clear to see inside the @entity27 on thursday night			0
around 10,000 @entity6 fans made the 300 mile journey to @entity7 to watch their side in @entity1 action @entity6 fans are revelling in their club 's first @entity34 adventure since the 2009/10 season @entity6 fans took over the main square in @entity7 ahead of their side 's goalless draw in @entity13 blue shirts dominated almost two complete tiers of the stadium while hundreds of banners including the messages ‘ @entity49 ( @entity50 ) is boss ’ and ‘ @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , we dream the same dream ’ adorned the hoardings during a 0 - 0 draw which the @entity6 remain top of their group			1
although the @entity56 faithful did n’t get the chance to celebrate a goal , @entity6 kept possession well and stuck to @entity53 ’s attacking style all while appreciating the importance of a draw away from home in @entity34			1
@entity50 , who had to play with a bandage wrapped around his head for the majority of his @entity34 debut after an early collision , took to @entity9 to praise the @entity6 fans			1
he tweeted : ’ good point and clean sheet , travelling fans were outstanding as always ’			0
unfortunately for @entity6 ’s travelling contingent , what should be remembered as a brilliant away trip was slightly marred by two separate events which saw around 100 hooded @entity7 fans stage an unprovoked attack on unsuspecting @entity79 fans outside a bar on wednesday night			1
police arrived on the scene within minutes , but eye witnesses reported a number of injuries with some @entity6 fans suffering bloodied head wounds			2
a doorman at the @entity89 told the @entity90 : ’ the @entity7 hooligans just appeared from the @entity92 across the road , from a side street , and just ran at the pub. there were some @entity6 fans outside smoking and they got caught cold			2
‘ the hooligans picked up chairs we had stacked up outside and attacked them while others used them to smash windows and try to get inside			0
’ the atmosphere was largely friendly but pockets of violence broke out on both wednesday and thursday @entity13 riot police officers run after fans during clashes which broke out in the main square of @entity7 follow all the latest # @entity1 action on : - @entity112 - @entity111 - @entity9 - @entity113 - website - @entity114 a second incident occurred on thursday afternoon as fans soaked up the pre-match atmosphere in the heart of @entity7 ’s city centre before riot police released three tear gas bombs while charging towards what they clearly believed to be a unruly group of @entity6 fans			1
the general consensus in the aftermath of both incidents seemed to be that the away support had been the victims of their second unprovoked attack in as many days as the official @entity6 @entity9 account warned fans to stay away from the area			0
the club tweeted on thursday afternoon : ‘ we advise @entity6 fans in @entity7 to avoid the main square in the city centre			1
’ fortunately , there seemed to be no further incidents after the game itself as @entity143 reporter @entity142 took to @entity9 to reveal some fun and games between fans and police			0
he wrote : ‘ police had a microphone to speak to fans at metro ... a fan grabs it and starts : ‘ 60 grand , @entity155 ’ ... they let him do two choruses ! ’ at any rate , the @entity156 did n’t let the two isolated incidents dampen their spirits as they travelled in their numbers to fill out their 5,000 seat allocation as well as popping up in several pockets within the home support			1
both sets of fans traded chants during the early stages of the game itself before a spell of pressure from the home side saw @entity7 fans turn the volume up to 11 inside the 50,0000 capacity @entity27			2
@entity175 hard fought point - @entity53 @entity176 salutes the @entity6 faithful after he kept a clean sheet in @entity6 's goalless draw in @entity7 @entity180 and @entity181 applaud the visiting fans who made the journey in large numbers not to be outdone , @entity6 fans got behind their team with several renditions of ‘ @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , oh ’ despite an at times nervy performance from @entity53 ’s side			1
speaking shortly after the game , @entity79 boss @entity53 also took time to praise the fans , while claiming their support will drive @entity6 ’s push for @entity34 glory			1
he said : ‘ it amazes me every day , the day - to - day support we receive			0
‘ it gives everybody at the club more strength to keep progressing and to keep having more nights like this in @entity34 , because that is what our fans deserve			0
’ unfortunately for the fans in blue , @entity6 could n’t quite build on their impressive 3 - 0 against @entity212 last weekend as @entity213 looked like a lively proposition , particularly for the first 45 minutes			0
@entity90 loanee @entity213 will have endeared himself to his parent club with an impressive performance against his @entity25 rivals to be			0
the young @entity220 ’s highlight came in the 20th minute as he skipped past @entity180 before storming away from @entity221 in a move that will have left @entity224 fans salivating			0
with the @entity1 being the gateway to the @entity226 for the first time , @entity6 fans know going all the way this season will hand @entity53 ’s side a spot at @entity34 ’s top table , which each @entity233 will tell you is well worth the 320 - mile trip to northern @entity13			1
their road to @entity237 may have only just begun but @entity6 players have been given a fantastic reason to care about this competition			0
the passion and desire shown from the blue side of @entity25 was something to behold and may just see @entity53 collect his first major trophy as @entity79 boss			0
@entity247 vies for the ball with @entity7 's @entity13 midfielder @entity249 as neither side could find a winner @entity7 's @entity253 defender @entity252 attempts to stop @entity6 's @entity254 launch an attack follow all the latest # @entity1 action on @entity9 and at @entity114			2
