school lunches have never been known for being appetizing â€” but these ones are particularly disgusting			1
students across @entity3 are taking it to social media to demonstrate against the school meal rules championed by first lady @entity7			1
they 're using the sarcastic hashtag ' @entity9 ' and posting pictures of piles of mushy lunches , unreasonably small portions and the kind of fare that has some students saying even ' prisoners eat better food			1
the school meal rules , phased in since 2012 and championed by first lady @entity7 , require more fruits , vegetables and whole grains in the lunch line			1
the standards also limit sodium , sugar and fat			0
some school nutrition directors have lobbied for a break , saying the rules have proven to be costly and restrictive			1
@entity27 @entity26 have said they are an overreach , and have pushed a one - year waiver that would allow schools to opt out of the standards if they lost money on meal programs over a six - month period			1
the waiver language stalled this summer after the first lady lobbied aggressively against it and the @entity27 issued a veto threat			2
the food and farm spending bill that contained the provision was pulled from the @entity27 floor , a move @entity26 attributed to scheduling issues			2
but the waiver has new life this month as lawmakers are expected to pass a catchall spending bill to keep government programs running			0
@entity65 rep. @entity65 of @entity66 , the chairman of the @entity27 subcommittee that oversees the school meal spending , has been pushing to include the waiver in the wide - ranging bill			1
@entity73 chairwoman @entity72 , @entity74 , and @entity75 sen. @entity75 of @entity76 both said thursday that there are ongoing negotiations between the @entity27 and the @entity73 over the waiver			0
a @entity73 bill approved by a spending committee in may did not include the waiver , but called for further study on sodium and whole grains requirements			0
@entity86 what the ' orange juice ' served at her @entity90 school looks like first lady @entity7 championed the lunch rules that nutrition directors complain are too clostly and restrictive filling ? students go hungry after a paltry lettuce - and - cheese sandwich			1
high schooler @entity95 says she received two of these for a meal , which were enough to fill her up , and that ' they were awful ' at the time , @entity75 said there was not enough support for the @entity27 's one - year waiver in the @entity73 , even though he was supportive of it himself			2
but he said this week that could change as lawmakers negotiate the massive year - end spending bill			0
' all of these things are part of a negotiation , ' @entity75 said			0
' i think we 'll get something , but we 'll have to see where it ends up			0
' on friday , @entity27 minority leader @entity114 , @entity115 , listed ' lowering standards for school lunches for our children ' as one of a few ' very destructive riders ' that would be unacceptable to @entity121 in the spending bill			1
@entity27 nutrition policy adviser @entity123 said the @entity27 is ' deeply engaged ' on the school meals policy , which has become one of the first lady 's signature issues			2
he said the policy is a top priority for the administration			0
' we 'll always look to be flexible where appropriate , but what we 're not going to do is undermine science and the health of kids in any way , ' @entity123 said			0
@entity138 complains about the small portions she gets at her @entity141 school this summer , mrs. @entity7 said she would fight ' until the bitter end ' to make sure kids have good nutrition in schools			1
while many schools have implemented the new standards successfully , others have said it 's not working for them			2
the schools pushing for changes say limits on sodium and requirements for more whole grains are particularly challenging , while some school officials say kids are throwing away fruits and vegetables they are required to take			2
the changes have been pushed by the @entity158 , a group that counts both school nutrition directors and the food companies that produce many of the school foods among its members			1
the group said this week that a survey it conducted of more than 1,100 school lunch operators showed that more than half predict program expenses will exceed revenue this year			0
an @entity169 shows the new meals that have ' ruined ' his school lunch in @entity174 , student @entity173 says her chicken nuggets came burned and void of any chicken advocates for the healthier meal standards say the changes will take time			1
they predict there will be fewer problems as kids get used to the new foods and the food industry creates more tasty products that follow the standards , like whole grain pastas and tortillas that are now required to be served			0
as schools have complained , @entity192 has shown some flexibility in tweaking the standards			0
in 2012 , just a few months after the first rules went into effect , the department scrapped maximums on proteins and grains after students complained they were hungry			0
and @entity192 said earlier this year that schools can put off for two years a requirement that all pastas in schools be whole - grain rich , or more than half whole grain , if they can demonstrate that they have had ' significant challenges ' in preparing the pasta			2
the year - end spending bill wo n't be the last time @entity210 takes on the school meal standards , as the overall law governing child nutrition policy , including school lunches , expires next year			1
both the @entity27 and the new @entity215 @entity73 are expected to consider changes to the meal standards as part of legislation renewing the law			1
at @entity221 , in @entity222 , student @entity220 says his lunches are anything but filling			0

students are taking it to social media to demonstrate against the meal rules lobbied by first lady @entity7
lunches include tiny portions , mushy and *unrecognizable* menu items , a lettuce - and - cheese sandwich and chicken nuggets void of any chicken
school nutrition directors say the rules have proven to be costly and @entity240 @entity26 are making a final push this month to give schools a temporary break from the meal standards
