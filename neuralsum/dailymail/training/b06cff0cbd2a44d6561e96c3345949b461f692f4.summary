by @entity1 reporter published : 19:19 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 1 june 2013 many years may have passed since they last met , but the bonds of friendship among these women have clearly stood the test of time			0
but this is a reunion that , until recently , seemed impossible because three of these former schoolfriends have spent the past 30 - plus years thinking one of their old gang was dead			0
they found out they were wrong when @entity14 , now 66 , decided to trace the chums she grew up with in @entity16 , @entity17			1
together again : @entity14 , 66 met her long - lost friends in a tearful reunion this week			1
pictured left to right : @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity14 and @entity22 mistaken : the three schoolfriends were stunned to hear @entity14 was alive after believing she had died 30 years ago memory lane : the women this week returned to this pub , where the last photo of them was taken			1
pictured left to right @entity29 , @entity30 ( standing ) @entity20 , @entity14 and @entity22 when she got in touch , they were stunned to hear she was alive after reading of her ‘ untimely ’ death in a newspaper obituary in 1980			1
the mix - up happened when mrs @entity14 ’s mother , @entity36 , died of cancer and her daughter wanted to let her former community know			1
the family had moved to @entity41 and mrs @entity14 phoned the local newspaper in their native @entity17 to place an obituary			1
but the paper confused the women ’s names and told readers that @entity14 had died aged 34			2
botched : @entity14 placed an obituary for her mother in @entity51 newspaper in 1980 but the @entity52 accidentally printed @entity14 's name instead of her mother 's mrs @entity14 , a painter who now lives in @entity55 , discovered the bungle after revisiting her first home and phoning friends from @entity60 ’s @entity59			1
four of the gang have now met up 50 years on from when they were last pictured together – in the same pub. the original photo showed mrs @entity14 alongside @entity29 , @entity65 , @entity20 ( now @entity66 ) and @entity22			2
they met again at the @entity69 pub after mrs @entity14 invited them for a drink			2
mrs @entity14 said : ‘ it is obviously fantastic to see everyone			0
' when i got in touch with @entity65 she sounded very odd			0
she rang me back and said , “ i ’m terribly sorry , but we all thought you were dead ”			0
’ mrs @entity66 , 66 , from @entity78 , @entity79 , said : ‘ @entity80 is one of my oldest friends and to have lost her all those years because of a silly mix - up was terrible			0
’ the only one missing from the original line - up was mrs @entity29			0
mrs @entity14 said : ‘ we ’d absolutely love to hear from her			0

@entity14 , 66 , moved away with family from @entity51 *hometown*
she placed an obituary for her mother in @entity51 newspaper in 1980
the @entity52 printed @entity14 's name instead of her mother 's
realised mistake when she contacted old friends from @entity60 's *convent*
