by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:58 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 10:55 est , 1 october 2012 the @entity3 leadership today avoided an embarrassing stand - off with their union paymasters after a motion criticising their support for public sector pay freezes was watered down			1
@entity11 and @entity12 risked humiliation , when a motion condemned their support for the government curbs on wage rises			1
but after a backroom deal , the motion was torn up and replaced with one merely ' noting ' the policy , although angry union leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric against the party 's leaders			1
@entity38 , general secretary of the @entity39 which has given almost £ 7million to @entity3 in the last two years , claimed his members were ‘ furious ’ at the @entity3 leaderships ‘ crazy ’ policy of supporting pay restraint			1
he told mr @entity11 : ' a public spending squeeze while the @entity45 continues to let rip is simply not acceptable			2
' it is time for @entity3 to once and for all turn its back on the neo-liberalism of the past			2
' reject the siren voices from those whose policies and philosophy have been discredited , and embrace the radical alternative the country wants , which is the only way - the only way @entity3 will return to power			1
' mr @entity11 – dubbed ‘ @entity11 ’ for his closeness to the unions when he became leader two years ago – is now being forced to defend the government ’s policy of not increasing the wages state workers at a time of spending cuts			2
the row threatenened to overshadow today ’s keynote speech by mr @entity12 , who today claimed the ‘ vast majority ’ of union members back his strategy			0
@entity74 leader @entity73 today targeted mr @entity12 with a four - page report on mr @entity12 which he said was aimed at highlighting his call for the @entity3 leadership to connect with ordinary workers			2
' we have to make sure that the public face of the party can connect with the public and that they are not damaged or dented by past mistakes which have not been owned up to			0
' @entity12 goes through his speech with @entity3 leader @entity11 at their conference hotel in @entity88 but today mr @entity12 , who was booed when the addressed the @entity89 last month , insisted it was not his job to be popular			1
‘ what people want is a unified @entity3 taking the argument to the country against a coalition government which is divided and failing and that 's what i 'm going to do			1
‘ it 's not my job as shadow chancellor to make everybody happy			1
my job is to make sure that we 've got strong , credible policies which add up and make sense and are costed			2
' one union leader said @entity12 would ' give an aspirin a headache ' he tried to turn the row to his advantage , adding : ‘ if people see some trade union leaders having a go at me because i am saying we have got to be disciplined on spending , tough on pay , put jobs first , rebuild this country and kick - start our recovery for the future , i think most people would say that 's what we 'd expect from the @entity3 leadership and that 's what we are going to deliver			1
’ @entity39 is now hoping to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people to march against the cuts on october 20			0
a motion by the unison union had called on the conference to ‘ condemn ’ the pay freeze which has hit millions of public sector workers			0
but in an attempt to spare the leadership embarrassment , the wording was watered down to ‘ note ’ the pay freeze			0
it condemns the fact that most of the lowest paid have not received a promised £ 250 pay rise			0
later mr @entity12 called for the £ 3billion raised by selling off @entity142 mobile phone licences to be used to build 100,000 affordable homes and offer a stamp duty tax break for first - time buyers			0
but there is still confusion about whether @entity3 will commit to the coalition 's spending plans , and whether any of the spending pledges made this week will still be policy by the time of the 2015 election			1
@entity3 has announced promises to break up the banks , reverse the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p and spend billions on new homes			0
but mr @entity12 told @entity160 : ' i can make no commitment now to reverse any of those cuts or the tax rises , because we do n’t know what economy ’s going to be like in two months time , let alone in two years ’ time when the election comes			0
' i ’m going to say today we will have a zero budget review when we look at every pound that is spent and say ‘ is it being spent well , can we make the savings ’ , that ’s what i think people would expect us to say			0

shadow chancellor says it is not his job to be popular
the unite union which has given £ 7million to @entity11 's @entity3 leads the criticism of support for curbs on pay rises
confusion as shadow chancellor admits he can not commit to implement the policies he is calling for now
