@entity0 is split down the middle over whether @entity2 should get an @entity3 for his ' motion captured ' role in @entity6 @entity0 is split down the middle over whether @entity8 actor @entity2 should get an @entity3 for his ' motion captured ' role in @entity6			1
the cinematic star is being tipped as a contender for a golden statuette for his role as @entity14 in the summer blockbuster			1
but @entity16 has yet to decide whether @entity2 's performance playing a computer - generated ape is acting or a character solely brought to life through computer programmers in an animation studio			1
the movie proved a smash hit in cinemas internationally and brought in box office profits of $ 707.4m			0
the stars of the @entity28 are currently in @entity0 promoting the @entity30 release of the movie			0
@entity33 is promoting its cast for the supporting acting categories in the @entity3 , and @entity2 would be the first actor to win an @entity3 for a ' motion capture ' role , it emerged			1
but the potential win for @entity2 's performance , which was filmed using ' motion - capture ' technology , has sparked a fresh debate in @entity0 over whether it counts as acting or animation			1
a managing director of @entity8 film and television post-production house @entity47 , said the star should be considered for an @entity3 because whether he 's played an ape or a man , it 's all performance			0
@entity51 said : ' in this case the animal he 's portraying comes from his expertise and understanding of the role and that is truly acting			0
' @entity69 , entertainment product manager at @entity70 , which makes motion - capture systems , said @entity2 's acting should be counted in as the award season in @entity0 gets into gear			1

@entity2 's co-star @entity87 has cast doubt over whether his performance was ' the sort of thing ' the @entity3 will accept because of the heavy use of computer generated imagery			1
and @entity94 worries that his profession will end up redundant if @entity0 does consider the @entity8 man 's performance to be acting and therefore entitled to be nominated for awards			1
' actors will kind of be a thing of the past , ' he told the @entity101			2
' we 'll be turned into combinations			0
a director will be able to say : ' i want 60 per cent @entity106 ; give me 10 per cent @entity94 and throw some @entity107 in there '			0
' actors ' unions have no objection though , and see the possible shift to accepting a performance made part - animation lab , part - acting is a good thing for actors			1
@entity118 , assistant general secretary of actors union equity , said : ' it simply has n't been a matter for debate in @entity122			0
no one is asking if @entity2 is acting or not			2
' no concerns have been raised to us			0
