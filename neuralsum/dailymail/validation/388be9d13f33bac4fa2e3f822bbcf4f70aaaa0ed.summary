sat inside a crammed central @entity2 sandwich shop , @entity0 flashes those world - renowned pearly whites			1
after the week @entity5 ’s had , football ’s greatest ever knew exactly what was coming			1
‘ i never saw myself play , but i think i was the better player , ’ the 74 - year - old tells @entity8 , complete with beaming grin			2
as @entity11 said of @entity5 on wednesday , you do n’t get to be this good without having a bit of an ego			1
a beaming @entity0 prepares to take a bite from a footlong as former @entity16 striker @entity15 looks on the @entity18 great was in good form ahead of sunday 's mouthwatering match on @entity21 three months after leaving a @entity18 hospital following a urinary tract infection and now with a clean bill of health , @entity0 has plenty to tell			1
much more than playfully scoring points against the magician who mesmerised @entity29 on wednesday night			0
he explains @entity32 ’s decision to jet off to @entity34 this summer as one taken to wind down , relax and retire , while he considers @entity16 ’s clash against @entity36 to be matched only by @entity37 in terms of global appeal			1
contrary to hysteria , there is nothing fundamentally wrong with @entity45 football , he continues , despite a fortnight which may end up serving as a nadir for the game in this country			1
and he cites the reason for a lack of success internationally as being largely down to our best players finding themselves ‘ too comfortable ’ in the @entity56 bubble and unwilling to move abroad at their peak			1
but it is when the names @entity5 and @entity61 are mentioned that @entity0 truly comes alive			1
they are the pair who rival him - he of three @entity67 - winners ’ medals - @entity68 and @entity70 as the all - time genuine superstars			2
the eyes widen , hands coming up to articulate his point			0
there is a sense that these two are the only men to really excite a man who has seen it all			0
@entity15 , @entity0 and @entity81 show off a @entity16 top with the famous @entity18 's @entity83 on the back @entity15 and @entity0 pose with the shirt behind the counter at a @entity88 outlet in @entity2 on friday afternoon @entity61 is a man who scores goals , but @entity0 reckons he falls behind @entity5 @entity5 gets @entity0 's vote as the best player of the modern era after his consistent displays of the past decade not shy , he is more than happy to settle debates which have raged in pubs and on concourses across @entity98 for the best part of a decade			1
‘ the two best at the moment are obviously @entity61 and @entity5 , ’ he says			1
‘ which is the best one ? @entity5 has been the best player of the last 10 years			1
‘ that level , the player who played at the same level for 10 years			0
he never plays badly and is a very quiet guy			0
‘ @entity61 is that striker who scores goals , but @entity5 does that and helps with assists			1
’ so , @entity5 is top dog ; how does the @entity112 compare to the original luminary ? the grin emerges			1
‘ i think i was a little better in the air , ’ he adds			2
‘ i used to kick it with both feet			0
’ @entity15 , @entity0 and @entity81 laugh at the counter as the @entity18 adds another shirt to his collection @entity0 makes his point as our man speaks to the greatest footballer of all time about a smorgasbord of subjects there are more serious matters at hand for the @entity132 at present			1
this campaign has been hellish , our elite embarrassed and all dumped out of continental competition by @entity137			0
that matters little to a scorer of 650 league career goals			0
‘ oh yes , definitely ’ he says when asked if the @entity132 remained the best division in the world			1
‘ it pains me as a @entity18 , but i have to say that			1
even after the struggles in @entity98 this week			0
remember , losing is part of the game			2
but there is no doubt that it ’s the top league			0
‘ i do n’t think there ’s anything wrong - it ’s something you ca n’t explain			0
‘ use this as an example			0
it is n’t the same , but similar			0
@entity157 have won five @entity158 , but the two we played in @entity157 we lost			0
you ca n’t explain that			0
‘ i was nine years old for my first @entity67 watching			0
we played @entity165 in the final at the @entity167 - i was with my father - and we lost			0
i said “ what happened ? ” my father cried and he said “ @entity157 have lost it ”			0
‘ we ’ve won five now - i was lucky enough to win three			0
but now the @entity67 in @entity157 ... we lost ! it ’s the same with the football in @entity45			1
they have good teams , good players			2
@entity0 , real name @entity174 do @entity176 , was just 17 when he helped @entity157 to their first @entity67 @entity0 was captain of the great 1970 @entity18 side which won their third @entity180 trophy in five @entity158 ‘ one thing i would say about @entity45 players is that they do n’t have experience of playing abroad			1
you do n’t see them playing in @entity34 or @entity186			0
the @entity45 players should be playing outside , but it ’s too comfortable to play here			1
‘ to play in @entity34 is more complicated - they need that experience			2
that ’s the only thing you can say about @entity45			1
’ two englishmen who will ply their trade elsewhere come next season are @entity32 and @entity197 , both set for the @entity198 with @entity199 and @entity200 respectively			1
it is 40 years since @entity0 was in @entity34 ’s cultural hub with a @entity204 team including @entity205 and @entity206			1
only now is the perception of the country ’s major division changing , although the @entity18 says stars still head stateside to unwind			1
‘ i like @entity32 very much			2
if i could pick a team , he would be in it			0
i do n’t know how he feels			0
he ’s chosen to go to the @entity198 , the same as @entity212			2
‘ if you want to rest and retire , the competition there is n’t as big as it is over here			0
maybe he wants to relax a little bit			2
‘ during my time we had @entity205 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity206			1
but people do n’t realise that the @entity221 has a good level of football			0
’ @entity32 guided @entity16 to their fifth @entity224 on that unforgettable night in @entity225 @entity0 , @entity205 ( second right ) , @entity228 ( right ) , his wife and mrs @entity205 ( left ) @entity0 places @entity32 on a pedestal with the great @entity205 , both making his @entity231 asked where the @entity16 skipper would rank among the best midfielders of all time , he compares him with @entity237 ’s biggest ever star			1
‘ maybe people do n’t remember , but @entity205 had the same style , ’ he adds			1
‘ i like @entity32 , he is a similar intelligent player			2
there is no doubt they ’d both make my team			2
’ as for the rumble on @entity21 this weekend – it will be the sixth time @entity0 has visited @entity246 – there is a simple message : the @entity249 has the exact same appeal of @entity37			1
‘ they are very , very similar games			0
it ’s one of the best in today ’s game			2
i always look forward to going to @entity246			0
i love to see good football			0
‘ @entity256 have excellent players			0
it ’s not only @entity5 , but @entity259 and @entity260			2
maybe they have more individuals , but as a team @entity16 are the same			2
’ @entity262 visted a @entity264 store to discuss football , nutrition and training in the run up to the @entity16 v @entity36 football match on sunday march 22			1

the greatest footballer of all time weighed in to the @entity5 vs @entity61 debate
@entity0 says more @entity45 players should broaden their *horizons* and play abroad
the @entity132 is the *strongest* in the world , he adds
@entity32 's decision to move to the @entity198 may be to ' relax '
he says @entity32 would make his @entity283 and compares the @entity16 captain to @entity285 great @entity205
ahead of @entity16 's game with @entity36 , the @entity18 great compared the tie to @entity37
