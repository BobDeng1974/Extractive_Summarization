@entity0 , 37 , was diagnosed with @entity1 in 2010 after an mri scan revealed lesions on her brain and spine a mother - of - three who spent two years being treated for multiple sclerosis has been cured with a simple course of antibiotics – after it was revealed that her symptoms were actually caused by a tick bite			1
@entity0 - @entity0 , 37 , was facing life in a wheelchair after being mistakenly diagnosed with @entity1 , a condition which attacks the central nervous system			1
but when her symptoms deteriorated , she carried out her own research and discovered she may have been infected with @entity19 following a bite from a parasitic tick			1
now , after years of expensive drug therapy and injections for @entity1 , a simple course of antibiotics has cleared all of her symptoms			1
mrs @entity28 's troubles first started in 2010 after she went to her gp complaining of a numb finger two months after the birth of her daughter , @entity33			2
she initially thought she had trapped a nerve carrying newborn @entity33 around , but when she was sent to a neurologist she began to worry			2
an extensive mri revealed lesions on her brain and spinal cord , consistent with @entity1 ‘ initially , i was really glad of the diagnosis because @entity1 was a well - recognised illness and a lot of money had been put into researching it and providing medication , ’ ms @entity28 , from from @entity47 , @entity48			1
‘ in hindsight , i wonder if the diagnosis was too quick - and now i know it is lyme disease , i wish i had pushed further for more tests			1
’ it was only when she started to get muscle pains - which she was told were not symptoms of @entity1 - that her suspicions were roused			1
she then spoke to a friend who told her to check for the tick - borne disease			1
she spent two years on a grueling drug regime for @entity1 before developing other symptoms which were not consistent with the disease			1
she did some of her own research and realised she could have lyme disease ms @entity28 , a trained landscape architect , could not find a bite on her body , but , after undertaking some research , she learnt she could have been bitten years ago			1
the mother , originally from @entity70 , said : ‘ ticks are very common in @entity70			0
you are told about them from a very young age			0
‘ once you get bitten you might have a rash or flu - like symptoms quite quickly , but , if for some reason you do n't get the rash , you might think you are a bit under the weather			1
‘ but if it is not treated it travels through your body and can then cause long term damage because it can cross the blood , brain barrier			1
that is how a tick bite can be mistaken for ms. ‘ i spoke to a friend in @entity70 who told me they tested for @entity19 before ever diagnosing ms. ‘ it can lie dormant in you for years so it could have been in my system for a while			2
i do n't think it is very recent			0
i 'm convinced i have had it for years			0
’ she went to see her doctor who carried out tests which confirmed her suspicions			2
mrs @entity28 believes that she was bitten by a tick many years ago as they are common in her native @entity70 lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by infected ticks - most of which are found in woodland or heath areas			1
the first symptom tends to be a rash that is red and circular around the area of the bite			0
someone who is newly infected may also develop flu - like symptoms			2
if it is left untreated , @entity19 can cause further symptoms including muscle pain , joint swelling and neurological symptoms such as temporary paralysis of the facial muscles			2
in the later stages , the disease can also cause chronic fatigue			2
it is usually treated with antibiotics			2
it affects about 2,000 to 3,000 people in the @entity129 every year			0
source : @entity131 mrs @entity28 took her findings to her doctor and demanded a @entity19 test , which came back negative			1
but while another more detailed test was taken and sent to a specialist in @entity137 , she asked for antibiotics for the disease just in case			1
within four days , her symptoms had disappeared and just a month later the test came back positive for @entity19			1
mrs @entity28 , who lives with husband @entity143 , 37 , and her three children @entity144 , six , @entity146 , four , and @entity33 , two , is now calling for greater awareness to be made of the tiny parasites			2
she said : ‘ it is brilliant not to have ms. it is like a black cloud hanging over you			0
you do n't know what is coming			0
‘ they tell you , you may never have a relapse but then you read that you could be in a wheelchair in 10 years			0
i used to look at my children and think , “ i want to be there for you and i wo n't be able to ”			0
‘ psychologically , with @entity19 , you know what you are fighting , you know what can happen and you know how to stop it			0
‘ with ms that was never the case			0
‘ the medicine for @entity1 is so expensive too			1
i was injecting myself with it every other day , which is not pleasant			0
‘ i still have £ 2,500 worth of medication left which has to be destroyed now			0
it would have been so much cheaper to test for @entity19 at the start of the process			0
‘ it is so important to get the message out about it			0
especially with children playing outside at this time of year , ticks live in grass and could bite anyone at any point			0
‘ more needs to be done in this country to spread awareness ; it could save so much hassle , worry and heartache			0

@entity0 , 37 , was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2010
an mri scan showed lesions on her brain and spinal cord consistent with @entity1
was on expensive drug regime and thought she faced *future* in a wheelchair
developed other symptoms *inconsistent* with @entity1 so did some research
went to doctor and asked for test for tick - borne lyme disease
it came back positive so she was treated with a simple course of antibiotics
