at the @entity1 on saturday , @entity0 emerged from the bench with just 11 minutes to go hoping to turn what was to become an away defeat around for @entity4			1
but he was n't manager @entity6 's trump card , instead the @entity8 boss had preferred to bring @entity9 and @entity10 on earlier in search of a winner and , as things went downhill , an equaliser			0
@entity0 arrived at @entity15 13 months ago as @entity4 's £ 37.1million capture that was meant to halt the decline under @entity18 - instead his role now resembles the bit - part figure he was under @entity21 in those dark final days at @entity22			1
@entity0 is increasingly finding himself sidelined at @entity4 despite his impressive record the £ 37.1million signing from @entity22 had similar problems at his former club with manager @entity21 @entity0 finds a place on the bench away at @entity28 and he rarely makes it into a fully fit starting xi it 's sometimes easy to forget just how good @entity0 was in his first two years on @entity32 shores before @entity21 's arrival signalled the end of his time at @entity36			1
sitting in the no 10 role , @entity0 was the creative cog in a @entity22 side that conquered @entity40 in the @entity41 in 2012 ( with @entity0 setting up a goal in the final ) , won the @entity44 at @entity45 ( @entity0 creating @entity22 's opener ) and lifted the @entity48 trophy in 2013 ( @entity0 's corner led to the winner )			0
second - season totals of 20 goals and 35 assists in all competitions said it all			0
his failure to find a place under @entity21 looked to be @entity4 's gain			2
@entity18 snapped him up for a then club - record fee and after a slow start put down to a lack of match fitness @entity0 , scored six in his last six games of the season			1
but @entity65 just has n't taken the same shine to @entity0 that @entity68 , and before him @entity67 , @entity69 and @entity70 were also fans of the likeable @entity73 international			0
@entity65 's attitude reflects that of his former student @entity21			0
@entity0 celebrated winning the @entity41 and , a year later , the @entity48 while with @entity22 but returning boss @entity21 did not take a shine to @entity0 and he soon found his opportunities limited @entity0 arrived at @entity15 for £ 37.1m but there have been bigger signings since and he is n't first choice he praised @entity0 back in november but had earlier said he was ' not satisfied ' with the 26 - year - old			1
' we have played well but can improve and i was not so satisfied with ( @entity86 ) @entity85 as a striker and @entity0 as midfielder and that 's why i 'm changing , ' @entity65 said			0
with a constantly changing system and a wealth of attacking options , @entity65 wants his players to offer more than the attacking threat of @entity0 - hence why @entity95 keeps a place ahead of him despite his form going nowhere close to justifying his £ 59.7m fee			2
at @entity99 , @entity0 almost ended up in quarterback role , marshalling @entity4 's attacks from deep as they tried to penetrate the home side 's backline late on			1
@entity0 created one chance but @entity4 failed to find the net and fell to their fifth league defeat of the season			1
@entity0 's touch map against @entity99 showed him playing relatively deep			0
see more in our @entity111 here @entity0 had his best season in the @entity115 under @entity69 and @entity70 ( right ) in 2012 - 13 while still popular with the supporters at @entity15 , it seems @entity0 is yet to win @entity65 's trust the @entity119 remains popular with the @entity15 support - his goal output is still below just @entity122 and @entity85 in the rankings of @entity4 players - but there is a sense that he could do more when the going gets tough			1
his last strike that turned a game for @entity4 was back in early november against @entity130			0
the one thing that is clear is that if @entity65 can find a way to utilise @entity0 's talents , he has a top player on his hands - and one that almost single - handedly guided @entity22 to the top four in 2013			2
@entity65 would happily take one of those spots himself come may			0
the bench was a familiar spot for @entity0 under @entity21 but @entity65 will hope he can utilise his talents better			2

@entity0 played a quarterback - like role for @entity4 as a sub
he was brought to @entity4 for £ 37.1m by @entity18 last season
but now @entity6 is using @entity0 more like @entity21 did
the @entity151 *playmaker* could be the *key* to *unlocking* a top - four spot
