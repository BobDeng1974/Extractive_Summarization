by @entity0 published : 23:54 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 02:28 est , 5 march 2013 completing any marathon is a punishing ordeal			0
but throw in the sub-zero temperatures of @entity4 - and the possibility of plunging through a sheet of ice into the world 's deepest lake - and only the most determined of athletes need apply			1
less than 150 runners took part in the @entity13 yesterday , which saw competitors donning special , studded shoes in order to pound their way across the frozen surface of @entity4 's ancient @entity19			1
tough : the @entity20 in @entity4 sees competitors run across the frozen surface of the world 's deepest lake sub-zero temperatures : runners have to wear special studded shoes to make their way across the glassy frozen surface of the lake marathon organisers study satellite photos of the vast lake - the largest freshwater lake in the world - ahead of the annual event to identify possible cracks , and experts only plot the final , safest course across the surface immediately before the starting gun is fired			1
the unique event , now in its ninth year , attracts entrants from around the globe			0
the first 10km stretch of yesterday 's marathon took runners across the black , mirror - like surface of the lake , then on to a stretch of ice covered in densely packed snow			2
temperatures plunge as low as -12c in the small town of @entity53			0
extreme : @entity55 , who is @entity56 , travelled 4,000 miles to compete in the marathon in @entity4 yesterday demanding : the air is so clear and the ice surface so flat that runners can make out the distant finish line as soon as they set out re-fuelling station : tables laden with dried fruit and nuts , cheese , water and hot tea were provided for runners at 5km intervals the @entity13 is psychologically as well as physically demanding , as the clear air and flat terrain means runners can make out the distant finish line almost as soon as they begin - giving them nothing to focus on but how far they are from their goal			1
' that 's really tough ' , said @entity77 , 46 , an @entity78 who lives in @entity80 and competed for the second time yesterday			0
local runner @entity82 crossed the finish line first yesterday , clocking up a time of three hours and seven minutes			0
sustenance : hot tea and water for the marathon runners was kept in insulated containers to stop in freezing unique : runners come from all corners of the globe to take part in the @entity20 in @entity4 , like @entity95 , 21 , who travelled from @entity96 to take part warm up : @entity99 runner @entity98 took off his shirt during the marathon despite the icy @entity4 temperatures welcome refreshments : the best runners complete this marathon at a pace 50 per cent slower than in other races , due to the nature of the surface relief : only 100 people participate in the extreme marathon each year			2
