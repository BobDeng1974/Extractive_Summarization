@entity0 believes @entity1 will hit the ground running in their attempt to win the @entity5 next season after persuading the @entity7 hierarchy to agree to a short and sharp pre-season tour of @entity9 in july			1
after last summer ’s mammoth trek across the @entity9 , an angry @entity1 manager @entity10 vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started			1
now @entity18 can reveal that @entity10 and @entity1 have turned down offers from @entity20 and @entity21 and are about to sign off a visit to @entity9 – in all likelihood to the west coast			1
the trip will last in the region of 12 days – a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by august 1			1
@entity1 beat @entity27 in @entity28 last summer in front of 109,000 fans @entity1 played four games in @entity9 last pre-season , here @entity34 scores against @entity36 @entity1 beat @entity37 in the final to win the @entity39 last summer while rivals such as @entity41 are trekking around @entity21 , @entity10 and his @entity1 players will operate out of one base in @entity9 and travel to their games from there			1
the club have agreed once again to rake part in the @entity39 that they won last summer by beating @entity37 in a final in @entity49			2
the tournament is played all over @entity9 but this time the promoters have essentially allowed @entity1 to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have @entity54 ’s most famous club in it			2
details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with @entity1 given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last friday			0
however , the announcement has been put on hold while @entity10 and @entity1 tweak final details			0
last season , @entity10 joined @entity1 after the @entity63 in @entity64 to find the club committed to a two - and - half week marathon comprising visits to @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and , finally , @entity49			0
@entity34 scored another spectacular goal for @entity1 against @entity74 last weekend following their tour of @entity9 , @entity1 suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league the @entity80 veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in @entity85			2
having to then play the final in @entity87 during a thunderstorm was the final straw			0
for long periods of this winter ’s negotiations , @entity10 and @entity1 seemed set to commit to a schedule on @entity9 ’s @entity94			2
it is understand , however , that @entity10 has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west			0
@entity10 has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in @entity69 and @entity106 last year			0
one possible base is the @entity109 training camp on @entity9 ’s north - west coast			1
the @entity5 season starts early this year , with the competition kicking off on august 8 .			0

@entity1 will *embark* on a short tour of @entity9 this summer
they are likely to spend 12 days on the west coast , *staying* in one place
@entity1 will defend their @entity39 title
