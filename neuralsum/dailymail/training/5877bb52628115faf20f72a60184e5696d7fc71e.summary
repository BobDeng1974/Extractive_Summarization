by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has likened @entity3 to the @entity4 of 2004 and has urged @entity5 to unleash his @entity6 on @entity7			1
it was at the @entity9 in @entity10 10 years ago that a teenage @entity4 exploded on to the international scene , scoring four times during the group stage before succumbing to injury in the quarter - final exit to the hosts			1
and @entity2 believes @entity3 - who missed the team coach ahead of the first training session in @entity19 but has impressed in the warm - up matches - should start when @entity21 open their @entity23 campaign against the @entity24 in @entity25 on saturday			1
speaking his mind : @entity2 has discussed @entity21 's forthcoming game against @entity7 in his latest blog on the ball : @entity3 , in training for @entity21 on wednesday , could be the next @entity4 , according to @entity2 @entity31 ; @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity3 ; @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity4 ‘ none of the big teams fear @entity21 in this @entity23			1
let ’s give them something to worry about			0
@entity3 must start , ’ said the former @entity41 star in his latest column for @entity43			1
‘ i was watching the @entity21 versus @entity48 friendly in an airport lounge , a bit back from the screen			0
in the first - half @entity3 went on a run and i thought , “ bloody hell , is that @entity4 ? ”			1
‘ @entity3 made me think of @entity4 at @entity55			1
i had to take a second look because i thought it was @entity4			1
’ teen talent : @entity4 scored four times for @entity21 at @entity55 joker in the pack : @entity4 enjoys @entity32 's company as @entity21 prepare for @entity7 on saturday @entity64 : @entity4 is set for his third @entity23 but did n't find the net on his previous two outings @entity2 , however , fears that @entity21 could stumble through their group before exiting the tournament in customary fashion via a penalty shootout			1
and that is why he insists a shift towards youth is what @entity5 needs			2
‘ this could be just me , but how do @entity21 play football ? i do n’t know			0
it seems there ’s speculation before every game about how we are going to approach the match tactically , ’ he went on			2
‘ two up front ? one up front ? wide players ? holding midfielders ? ‘ the strength of the @entity21 squad is this new breed of players who are enthusiastic , athletic and attack - minded			2
‘ there is no point taking people like @entity39 or @entity3 to @entity19 “ for the experience ”			0
' some might say it ’s risky			0
but these players have the fitness and ability to get the ball back if they lose it - hopefully not in dangerous positions			0
you want them to attack and give the opposition problems			0
‘ now is a great chance for @entity5 to give @entity106 football the identity we ’ve lacked			2
‘ do we want to go to a major tournament , get a couple of nil - all draws , a one - nil and then we might scrape through the group before we go out on penalties in the last 16 or quarter finals ? there ’s no future for @entity21 in this approach			0
‘ @entity5 has little to lose by going for the jugular in @entity117			2
will we be satisfied if @entity21 scrape through to the quarter - finals playing negative football ? ' let ’s not do that and instead take responsibility for what happens if we go for it			0
let these @entity21 players off the leash			0

the former @entity41 star says the @entity131 *youngster* *reminds* him of a teenage @entity4
@entity2 has urged @entity5 to unleash his young players in the @entity23 opener on saturday
he fears a *conservative* approach would lead to a *disappointing* campaign
