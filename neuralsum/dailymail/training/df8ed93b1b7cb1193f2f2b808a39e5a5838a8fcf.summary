@entity2 's @entity1 prospects are in danger of being damaged by the uncertainty over his future at @entity7			1
the 29 - year - old was forced into the role of frustrated spectator on sunday as the @entity7 beat @entity11 in a feisty @entity13 clash at @entity14			1
the veteran of 43 tests and two @entity18 tours was in the stand while @entity20 started at blindside flanker and @entity23 @entity22 was preferred as the back - row replacement on the bench			1
@entity26 flanker @entity2 has made only three appearances for the @entity7 this season @entity2 's lack of game time has partly been down to the superb form of young flanker @entity20 ( left ) @entity23 @entity22 ( pictured in orange ) has been preferred as the back - row replacement for the @entity7 nov 28 , 2009 : sidelined for six weeks after medial ligament tear against @entity34			1
jan 16 , 2010 : ruled out of @entity35 after grade two medial ligament injury against @entity38			0
nov 27 , 2010 : out for three months after fracturing right shoulder blade against @entity40			0
april 21 , 2012 : eight - month absence after suffering triple fracture of @entity43 against @entity44			0
sept 11 , 2013 : sidelined for rest of 2013 - 14 season after knee injury v @entity48			0
oct 10 , 2014 : ruled out of autumn test series with recurring knee problem			0
after the game , @entity7 director of rugby @entity51 confirmed that @entity2 had been left out of the match - day 23 , rather than being unavailable due to yet another injury , saying : ‘ he was fit — not selected			1
’ so far this season , @entity2 has made only three appearances for the @entity7 — partly due to a knee problem and partly due to the strides made by @entity20 , who has excelled in his position			1
he only played twice in the previous campaign , which was cut short by a serious knee injury			0
the year before that , he was ruled out for several months after breaking his neck — a frightening setback which required major surgery			0
@entity2 is out of contract in the summer and his hopes of staying at the club where he has played throughout his professional career are in the balance			1
@entity51 said : ‘ he needs to play			2
he ’s only played five games in two years so he needs to play			0
it ( non-selection against @entity11 ) was just about fitness — as in , he ’s not played			2
’ @entity7 director of rugby @entity51 wants @entity2 to stay at the club despite his injury problems asked if he really wanted the athletic forward to stay , @entity51 responded with a resounding ‘ yes ’ , but it is understood the sticking point is @entity7 ’s insistence that he accepts reduced terms on any new deal			1
their logic is understandable in the circumstances , but it has created a stand - off			0
it is unclear whether other clubs have made enquiries about @entity2			2
the implications for @entity26 are stark			2
if @entity2 is short of game time at club level , he can not be seriously considered for a recall			1
he was a fixture in the first @entity35 campaign of @entity102 ’s tenure as head coach , in 2012 — delivering an astonishing , match - winning performance against @entity105 in @entity106 — but has not represented his country since the record defeat in @entity109 in march 2013			0
@entity2 races away for a try against the @entity112 during the 2013 @entity114 tour of @entity115 months later , he made two test appearances for the @entity18 , but since then his international career has been on hold			1
@entity7 were able to confirm yesterday that @entity119 has signed a new contract which will keep him at @entity14 for a further two years			1
the 22 - year - old fly - half has rejected the option of a return to the @entity124			0
his decision is another blow to the @entity129 region , who will lose @entity133 stand - off @entity131 at the end of the season			0
he has opted to join @entity11 — where he will largely serve as understudy to @entity137 — for a salary thought to be around £ 300,000 per year			2
this is likely to spell an end to his @entity142 career , at least in the short term , as the so - called ‘ @entity145 ’ against picking players based abroad is due to be more strictly enforced			0
@entity2 showcases his trademark pace as he goes over for a try against @entity105 in @entity106 in march 2012 another @entity149 who will be on the move in the summer is @entity151			2
the veteran utility back has been a bit - part figure at @entity11			1
while @entity155 has learned there has been interest from @entity105 and @entity158 , it is understood the 32 - year - old is more likely to stay in @entity26 , with @entity160 keen to recruit him			1
reports in @entity105 suggest @entity11 are trying to sign all black back row @entity164 .			0

@entity2 was left out of the @entity7 line - up for the game with @entity11
the @entity7 *triumphed* *17* - 8 over @entity*17*0 's side at @entity14
@entity*17*2 @entity20 and @entity22 have *seemingly* moved ahead of @entity2 in the backrow pecking order at @entity7
@entity7 boss @entity51 wants @entity2 to stay at the club
@entity2 has won 43 caps for @entity26 and has been on two @entity18 tours
