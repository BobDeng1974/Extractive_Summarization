@entity1 ’s players were forced to train on wednesday against a deafening back - drop of @entity4 singing blaring from speakers , as they desperately strive to avoid a repeat of their 2013 calamity in @entity8			1
the national team ’s state - of - the - art headquarters in @entity11 resounded to the sound of @entity4 folk singer @entity13 ’s @entity13 , which has been adopted by fans as one of their anthems , to replicate the fervent din they will face at the @entity19 tomorrow night			1
head coach @entity20 used the ploy to prepare his squad for the @entity24 opener , as part of a drive to combat the partisan atmosphere which is likely to include a refusal to have the roof closed for the game			1
@entity1 's training session on wednesday was against a deafening back - drop of @entity4 singing from speakers the idea was pioneered by head coach @entity20 to prepare them for friday 's match at @entity38 two years ago , @entity1 slumped to a record 30 - 3 defeat in the @entity4 capital and they are on guard about the threat of another noisy ambush			1
‘ one of the bits of feedback we gave the players before the game two years ago was that the acoustics of the stadium are so loud that sometimes you ca n’t hear the communication on the field , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ @entity55 kept repeatedly saying this and all the players nodded their heads , but until they had actually experienced it , they did n’t really know			0
’ asked about the loud playing of @entity4 songs , he added : ‘ i did n’t want to leave it to chance this time around			0
it was only for 10 minutes but i wanted them to get the sense of what it feels like to play there			0
we did some phase play attack without the players being able to hear themselves think			0
we have eight players who have n’t played in the @entity19 before , so it was preparation			2
’ @entity74 , the @entity1 fly - half , understood the reasoning behind the musical accompaniment to training , saying : ‘ we expect it to be loud and a good atmosphere , so it was important to practise under those situations , because we want the communication to be good			2
’ the @entity84 no 10 is n’t concerned if he is booed when he is lining up goal - kicks , adding : ‘ it does n’t make it easier or harder if it ’s noisy			0
you ’re in your own little bubble , concentrating on the kick			0
’ @entity1 fly - half @entity74 says he wo n't be fazed if the @entity38 crowd booed him while he is goal - kicking @entity94 ( left ) and ( right ) practiced their kicking ahead of @entity1 's @entity24 opener @entity96 ( left ) and @entity97 train ahead of @entity1 's clash with @entity38 at the @entity19 wales have expressed a desire for the @entity19 roof to be closed on friday night , but @entity1 are destined to exercise their right to veto the move			1
@entity20 said : ‘ it looks like it is set fair and if it is , then we will probably want it open			2
it ’s forecast to be dry and part of the reason you ’d have a roof is to keep the conditions dry			0
if it ’s going to be dry , why do you need a roof ? ’ the head coach rejected the notion that having the roof open would dilute the atmosphere , adding : ‘ it ’s going to be pretty noisy anyway			2
’ @entity38 assistant coach @entity122 reacted to news of @entity1 ’s training soundtrack by arguing that it is evidence of their ‘ meticulous ’ approach			1
he also suggested that it is up to the home team to inspire the crowd to make a difference , saying : ‘ we all talk about the cauldron , but that stadium is only as good as the players ’ performance			0
’ however , @entity38 ’ @entity138 full back , @entity137 , has urged home fans to replicate the crescendo they produced in 2013			2
‘ that anthem two years ago was the loudest i ’ve ever heard it , ’ he said			1
‘ running out into that packed @entity19 is the best feeling ever and the crowd were just incredible			0
it gave us that buzz going into game			0
there is always that buzz about @entity38 v @entity1 and the history that goes with it			1
’ the roof at the @entity19 in @entity8 will remain open for the @entity24 opener on friday night			1
