by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 14 november 2013 @entity3 's discredited children ’s services unit has been told to improve immediately – or face intervention within weeks by ministers			2
bosses were yesterday warned the @entity7 could step in before @entity8 to strip the failing service of its responsibilities			1
the threat follows the deaths of vulnerable youngsters @entity14 , two , and seven - year - old @entity15 , which led to the city being branded a ‘ national disgrace ’ and one of the worst places to grow up in the western world			1
head : @entity23 , director of children 's services at @entity26 , said he would respect any decision that was made the unit now faces being run by @entity29 if an inspection this month by education watchdog @entity31 finds children ’s services are failing for the fifth year running			1
deputy prime minister @entity33 also warned that the department in @entity36 ’s second city – where a third of children live in poverty – was in ‘ the last chance saloon ’			1
critics say the move may not make any difference			2
following intervention in @entity46 in july following years of failure , the discredited council continues to play a key role			2
@entity49 seven - year - old @entity15 was starved to death by her mother and stepfather after social workers missed opportunities because they were said to be more interested in their @entity57 had been monitored and visited by at least nine social workers , education officers , teachers and police , but information was not acted upon and procedures were not @entity63 died of an infection in may 2008 following a ‘ chilling ’ punishment regime at her home in @entity68 , @entity51 social workers were disciplined after a report highlighted how some officials were more focused on ‘ the rights of the adults ’ and the ‘ potential impact ’ on their @entity74 the two - year - old had been seen by health workers at least 12 times with signs of abuse such as head injuries and cuts			2
but children ’s services believed his mother @entity83 when she said they were just bumps and bruises			0
in reality , @entity83 , 25 , had beaten her son and his body was found in 2011 with 37 injuries including bite marks , a fractured skull and a tear in his @entity94 report last month revealed @entity83 , jailed in june , had been ‘ surprised ’ he was n’t taken away from her at birth			0
it said ‘ staff were distracted by his mother ’s needs rather than the child ’s ’			1
at least three untrained workers – including a student on a work placement – were also put in charge of vital reviews			0
the latest threat came after education secretary @entity109 this week said he expected more failing authorities to be stripped of their control over children ’s services			1
@entity3 ’s children ’s services were recently criticised over missed opportunities to protect @entity14 before he was murdered by his mother @entity83 in 2011			0
in 2008 , @entity15 starved to death at her home in @entity68 , @entity3 , after being withdrawn from school , with children ’s care workers again criticised			1
@entity31 has rated the department inadequate every year since 2009 , and the @entity7 said yesterday another failure later this month would result in ‘ further action ’			1
@entity23 , director of children ’s service at @entity3 since july this year , said he would respect whatever decision was taken , but said the priority must be to recruit more social workers			0
currently the department has a vacancy rate of a quarter among qualified staff and a third among supervisors , he said			1
‘ i ’ve heard people thinking about jobs say that they ’ve been told not to come to @entity3 because it ’s a blot on their cv , ’ he told @entity134 ’s today programme			0
‘ i think that ’s unacceptable			0
’ mr @entity23 said the city council ’s role would continue to be bringing in ‘ the relationships and the money and the investment ’ but admitted ‘ it ca n’t do what it has always done ’			2
deputy prime minister mr @entity33 said ministers would look closely at the next @entity31 report			1
‘ clearly there have been some lamentable and indeed tragic failures , ’ he told a local radio station			2
‘ and i think it would be a duty for any government that if that report does n’t show that there have been significant improvements in the way in which the children ’s services have been run – given that we have a moral duty to make sure that these terrible cases do n’t re-occur – we would then need to step in one way or another			2
’ @entity166 , @entity167 mp for @entity168 , branded the warning a ‘ complete and utter political move ’ by @entity175 ministers and suggested the department be broken up and services managed at constituency level			1
but @entity176 , professor of social work at @entity178 , said constant naming and shaming by @entity31 and ministers was only making the situation worse by deterring capable staff from working there			0
‘ in my view that process has made the patient sicker , ’ she said			0
‘ the medicine is killing the patient			0
’ last month @entity31 chief inspector sir @entity189 accused @entity3 of a ‘ failure on a grand scale ’ , pointing out that infant mortality there is worse than in @entity194 and on a par with @entity196			0
in @entity46 , local authority services have been passed to a private firm until an independent trust is set up			0
but the council still retains key powers , including court orders to take children from their parents			0
