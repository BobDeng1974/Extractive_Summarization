by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:39 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 11:22 est , 4 may 2012 the woman at the centre of a ' too fat to fly ' controversy has announced that she is suing @entity5 , which refused to allow her on a flight because of her size			1
@entity9 resident @entity8 is taking on the airlines controversial ' customers of @entity13 ' policy which requires passengers to buy a second seat if they ca n't fit between the 17 - inch wide armrests			1
in her quest to seek an injunction against the @entity21 - headquartered carrier , ms @entity8 alleges that @entity5 ignored her ' constitutional rights ' and demonstrates ' discriminatory actions towards obese customers '			1
' we need to know what the rules are , ' she said			0
' we need to know if we need one seat or two , because this eyeballing happening at the gate is incredibly discriminatory , and it 's so unnecessary			0
' ms @entity8 rose to national prominence last year when a @entity5 employee declared that she was ' too fat to fly , ' and asked her to buy a second seat			1
before and after : ms @entity8 , seen before she took her first flight in april 2011 , and weighing around 300lbs , left , and a more recent photo , after she lost around 120 pounds , right making progress : @entity8 , pictured after significant weight loss in @entity64 's @entity63 , wrote on her blog : ' some days are easy , and some are a struggle ' the political strategist , along with her mother , @entity31 , were on a layover in @entity21 when they said they were singled out by an official in front of some 100 other passengers because of their size			1
' the gate agent came up to me and he asked me how much i weighed , what size clothes i wore , ' ms @entity8 told @entity83			1
' he said that i was too fat to fly , that i would need an additional seat , and he was really sort of crass about the whole thing			1
' she added : ' there was no privacy			0
' weigh in : @entity5 says any passenger who can not fit comfortably in their 17 - inch seats with both armrests down must purchase another seat policy : more than 90 per cent of the time , ' customers of size ' receive a refund for their second seat , a @entity5 spokesperson said at the time , ms @entity8 said she weighed between 240 and 300 pounds			1
she said the agent ' did n't know what the policy was , ' so a supervisor was brought in to assess the situation			0
according to @entity5 ’s website , the definitive gauge for a customer of @entity13 is fairly simple – the armrest			1
‘ it serves as the boundary between seats , which measure 17 inches wide			0
customers who are unable to lower both armrests and / or who encroach upon any portion of the adjacent seat should proactively book the number of seats needed prior to travel			0
’ @entity5 requested that its employees use sensitivity when addressing customers of size , noting it ’s difficult to hold a private conversation in a crowded airport			1
the airline encourages passengers to proactively purchase additional seats , the website reads , in order to avoid ‘ embarrassing conversations			1
’ the airline said that in 98 per cent of cases , the customer of size may obtain a refund because the flight is not full			0
source : @entity5 however , the supervisor was unaware of the airline 's policy as well , ms @entity8 said			1
following the incident , which @entity8 blogged about on her website @entity144 , a @entity5 executive apologised , refunded her ticket , and offered flight vouchers			1
flying on the same airline twice more @entity8 suffered no more embarrassments until @entity150 last year when she had to go through a similar experience			1
' something has to change			0
i just need some consistency , ' said @entity8 to @entity155			2
responding to the impending law - suit , a spokesman for @entity5 offered some advice			1
' the best case scenario is for the customer to notify us of any special needs ahead of time , ' said @entity164			0
' if providing the additional seat does not result in our having to deny another customer boarding , we will refund the ticket to the customer at no charge , which happens more than 90 percent of the time			0
' in fact , the airline said on their website that in 98 per cent of cases , the customer of size may obtain a refund because the flight is not full			0
struggle : for ms @entity8 , pictured three years ago when she weighed 400lbs , the two incidents with @entity5 were hurtful after she battled hard to lose weight motivation : a picture taken from @entity8 's blog alltheweigh.com which helped convince her that she needed to lose weight wide load ? director @entity185 was famously asked to leave a 2010 @entity5 flight in february 2010 , director @entity185 famously was told he was ‘ too wide for the sky			1
’ according to his @entity189 feed , he was removed from the @entity5 flight because he was deemed a safety risk			2
the @entity193 director was given a $ 100 voucher by the airline and boarded another flight			0
@entity5 later reached out to apologise			2
the airline also booted a thin flier from one of their seats in july of 2010 on a @entity201 - to - @entity202 flight so an obese 14 - year - old could have her seat			2
‘ it did n’t seem right that i should have to leave to accommodate someone who had only paid for one seat , ’ she told the @entity205 at the time			0
a @entity5 spokesperson later told the bee : ‘ we know this was awkward and we should have handled it better			1
’ the airline later apologised to the woman			0
at the time of the incident , @entity5 said they clearly stated in their ‘ @entity215 ’ policy that passengers who can not fit within the 17 - inch armrests must purchase an additional seat			1
according to @entity5 ’s website , the definitive gauge for a customer of @entity13 is fairly simple – the armrest			2
‘ it serves as the boundary between seats , which measure 17 inches wide			0
' customers who are unable to lower both armrests and / or who encroach upon any portion of the adjacent seat should proactively book the number of seats needed prior to travel			0
’ @entity5 requested that its employees use sensitivity when addressing customers of size , noting it ’s difficult to hold a private conversation in a crowded airport			2
the airline encourages passengers to proactively purchase additional seats , the website reads , in order to avoid ‘ embarrassing conversations			2
’ while @entity8 's crusade continues many passengers feel that they are being attacked by airlines			1
@entity251 announced this week that passengers might have to pay up to $ 100 for a carry - on bag , meaning any larger hand luggage could be charged for			2
however , the issue of size and passengers is clearly still emotive			0
' i do n't want the person next to me on top of my seat , or coming underneath the armrest because i 've paid for my whole seat , ' said @entity264 , the founder of @entity265 against @entity266			0
on the flip - side , @entity267 , a passenger rights spokesman wants greater acceptance shown to overweight people			2
' these are n't durable goods being shipped from point a to point b , ' said @entity267			0
' this is n't cattle being shipped to a livestock farm			0
' while her suit against @entity5 continues , @entity8 wants it to be known that she is n't an advocate for obesity			1
in fact , her blog records her current weight loss which at the moment is over 100 pounds down from what it was in april 2011			2
' while we may not be born with an innate privilege of flying on a plane , as paying consumers we do have the right to fly if we ’re willing to follow the rules , ' said @entity8			1
' and in order to do that , we need to know the rules			0

@entity9 resident @entity8 was told by airline worker that she was ' too fat to fly ' - twice
now she 's suing @entity5 , alleging that they *violated* her ' constitutional rights ' and humiliated her in front of other passengers
has since lost up to 120lbs from her heaviest weight - between 240 and 300 pounds
