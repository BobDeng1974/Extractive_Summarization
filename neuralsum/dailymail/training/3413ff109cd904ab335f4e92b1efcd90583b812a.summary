most of us have no idea a glass of seemingly healthy apple juice contains almost as much sugar as three @entity7 donuts or a bar of @entity9 , a survey has found			1
with almost seven teaspoons of sugar in a single serving , apple juice contains more than the recommended daily amount for adults who want to stay healthy			1
according to the @entity17 , this should be six teaspoons of ' added ' sugar - i.e. not that found naturally in products such as milk			1
the @entity17 recommends no more than six teaspoons of sugar a day similarly , a fat - free yogurt - a food also often marketed as a natural , healthy choice - contains five teaspoons of sugar - the same as in three scoops of ice cream			1
the high levels of sugar found in everyday – often so - called ‘ healthy items ’ - were revealed as part of a survey by @entity38			1
this asked 2,000 mothers if they were aware of the amount of sugar found in foods they may be giving their children			2
in the poll , more than 90 per cent admitted they had no idea about the high levels of sugar in apple juice and fat - free yogurt			1
@entity38 states the average glass of concentrated apple juice contains nearly seven teaspoons on sugar			1
one @entity57 glazed donut , on the other hand , contains 10g of sugar - which equates to two teaspoons			1
nearly half of mothers ( 46 per cent ) admitted they were worried their child might be addicted to sugar			1
a survey by @entity38 found that 90 per cent of mothers do n't know about the high levels of sugar in so - called healthy products like apple juice and fat - free yogurt			1
a fifth confess their child does n't eat a balanced diet but despite their concerns , a fifth confessed their child does not eat a balanced diet			1
and 60 per cent admitted they do not regularly look at the nutritional information on food			0
too much sugar in a child ’s diet can cause permanent damage to their health , including increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes			1
it can also cause tooth decay			0
despite this , 40 per cent of mothers said their children have sweets , fizzy drinks or chocolate at least once a day			2
earlier this year , the @entity17 published draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six			1
the guideline amount slashed was amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco			0
the number of obese @entity107 adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £ 50billion a year			0
the @entity17 said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yogurts , muesli , sauces , fizzy drinks , juice and smoothies			1
however , low - fat foods have also come under fire from experts , after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full - fat alternative			1
who also said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as @entity129 , which contains seven spoons			0
instead five or six teaspoons is the ideal figure that people should aim for			0
doctors say keeping to a maximum of six teaspoons of sugar a day is key to avoiding obesity , heart disease and other serious illnesses because they fear sugar is as dangerous as tobacco			1
chief medical officer @entity141 has already said a tax may be put on calorie - laden food and drink to curb soaring levels of obesity			2
until recently , it was thought that ‘ bad drinks ’ were those such as @entity129 and @entity148 , and fruit juice was a healthy alternative helping us get our ‘ five a day ’			2
but increasingly experts are warning that fruit juices and are fuelling the obesity epidemic			0
low - fat foods have also come under fire from experts , after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full - fat alternative			1
earlier this year a study found manufacturers are making their ‘ healthy ’ options more palatable by replacing fat with sugar			2
while most low - fat supermarket products contain a third fewer calories than their regular fat version , 10 per cent actually have more or the same calories , mainly due to added sugars			2
obesity specialist dr @entity171 said weight - conscious shoppers should realise that choosing low - fat products made by brands including @entity175 could hamper their efforts to cut calories			2
nearly a quarter of mothers said they like putting sugary treats in their child ’s lunchbox , with the top culprits being cakes , chocolate and fruit juice			2
on top of this , nearly a third of mothers think that as they give their children healthy food , sugar is n’t an issue			0
the news comes as @entity197 announce that schools and nurseries should run tooth brushing schemes to improve children ’s teeth			0
as many as one in eight children now suffer tooth decay by the age of three – although in some parts of @entity212 the rates are as high as a third			0
@entity213 ( pictured in their current form ) will be being rebranded as ' @entity216 ' and will contain less sugar and 20 per cent more honey @entity213 are being given a makeover in an attempt to address parents ' concerns about the amount of sugar in the cereal - and revive plunging sales			0
rebranded as ' @entity216 ' after the yellow furry character featured in previous adverts , they will be made from a new recipe with less sugar and 20 per cent more honey			0
the cereal will also feature traffic light nutritional labelling on the front of the pack , in a move manufacturers @entity238 said would allow customers to make ' informed decisions ' about what they eat for breakfast			0
overall , manufacturers say the sugar content has been reduced by a third in a decade			0
@entity246 will contain 8.6g of sugar – a cube and a half – in a 30g portion , down from the previous recipe which contained almost two cubes per portion			0
however critics say the move is largely a marketing ploy - as once broken down , honey and added sugar become the same thing - glucose			0
dietitian @entity260 told @entity261 : ' added sugar and honey are grouped in the same category by the @entity107 @entity265			0
' although honey is seen as more " natural " than added sugar , it is still counted as a " free sugar " - i.e. one that has been added to a product rather than say lactose , a sugar found naturally in milk			2
' once broken down in the body , honey will do exactly the same thing as the added sugar would have			0
