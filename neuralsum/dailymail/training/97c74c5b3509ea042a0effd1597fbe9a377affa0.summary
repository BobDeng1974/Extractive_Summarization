intrigue over @entity2 ’s poor injury record this season deepened on friday night when it emerged that their respected and long - serving fitness coach @entity4 is no longer involved in key first team duties			1
united manager @entity6 revealed on friday that he has nine players missing injured ahead of saturday 's visit of @entity9 in the @entity10			0
@entity11 has described the crisis as the worst he has ever known			0
now it has emerged that first team fitness expert @entity4 has been moved from his usual role to a job looking after the physical development of the club ’s younger players			1
it is understood that @entity11 ’s long serving fitness guru @entity21 is now in control of fitness planning and programming for the club ’s elite stars			1
@entity2 fitness coach @entity4 is no longer working with @entity6 's first team stars @entity4 , pictured with @entity11 , has been told to sharpen up the fitness of @entity2 's starlets @entity21 , pictured on the far left before @entity9 's win against @entity32 , will work with the senior team @entity34 , pictured to the right of @entity36 , was part of @entity11 's @entity39 staff at the @entity40 @entity4 was in charge of things on the club ’s pre-season tour of @entity45 and was regularly seen working with @entity46 and the rest of the first team on the trip			1
since then , though , the 42 - year - old has been less visible and sources at @entity52 confirmed last night that things had changed earlier in the season			0
@entity4 ’s only involvement with the first team now is some warm up drills before training and some strength work			0
he no longer has any involvement with the crucial task of designing and planning training , the vital role he had fulfilled since joining from @entity65 in 2007			2
there is no suggestion that the decision to move @entity4 is any reflection on his work , rather that @entity11 – in common with many managers – merely wished to work with his own man			0
however @entity11 ’s decision represents a risk as not only is @entity4 considered talented enough and experienced enough to work for the @entity75 with @entity76 and the @entity78 squad , he is liked , trusted and respected by all of the club ’s senior players			2
