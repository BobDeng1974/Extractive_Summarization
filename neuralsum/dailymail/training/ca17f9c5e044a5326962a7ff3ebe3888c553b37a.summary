by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 11:34 est , 18 march 2014 @entity2 is fighting off a $ 16.6million lawsuit over making an offensive gesture during an appearance at the @entity7 half - time show in 2012			1
the @entity10 - @entity9 artist , 38 , raised her middle finger and swore at the camera while performing alongside @entity13 and @entity14 , which led to the @entity17 @entity16 taking legal action			1
after initially demanding @entity2 pay a $ 1.5million ' breach of contract ' fine , the @entity16 are now asking for a further $ 15.1million			1
the @entity16 argue that this short cameo would be worth $ 15.1million had it been a tv advertisement , and so is suing @entity2 for the sum			1
the steep increase comes after @entity2 took the legal battle public in september last year and released a @entity37 video in which she accused the @entity16 of turning her into a scapegoat and that the behaviour of the teenage cheerleaders at the game was much worse			1
she said @entity13 herself had hired under - 16 dancers who had ' cheerleader outfits , hips thrusted in the air , legs wide open , in this very sexually provocative position			2
' @entity2 ’s legal team has responded to the demands by calling it an attempt to ‘ bully ’ the artist , and accuse the sports organisation of ‘ making an example of her for daring to challenge the @entity16 ’			1
rude : the singer flipped her middle finger and mouthed ' i do n't give a s * * * ' at a cameraman during her appearance with @entity13 and @entity14 at the 2012 sporting event ‘ the claim for restitution lacks any basis in law , fact , or logic , ' the performer 's response papers read			1
' [ the ] continued pursuit of this proceeding is transparently an exercise by the @entity16 intended solely to bully and make an example of respondents for daring to challenge @entity16			0
' 1993 - the first controversial performance involving a @entity79 sees @entity80 stand motionless on stage for a full one minute and 13 seconds			0
2004 - now known as ' @entity83 ' , the half - time show saw @entity84 's sister @entity79 suffer an infamous ' wardrobe malfunction ' as she was performing with @entity86			0
@entity86 was supposed to rip off a part of @entity79 's leather bustier to expose a red bra - but ended up showing the world @entity79 's naked breast for 9/16ths of a second			0
for this , @entity93 was fined $ 550,000 by the @entity95			0
2009 - @entity96 and the @entity97 performs in @entity98 , and @entity96 crotch - slams a tv camera			2
2013 - the @entity102 ' @entity101 suffers a blackout after @entity105 's half - time performance when she reunited @entity106			0
@entity2 - real name @entity108 - was n't paid for her performance at the 2012 event , but did have to enter an agreement acknowledging ' the great value of the goodwill associated with the @entity16 and the tremendous public respect and reputation for wholesomeness enjoyed by the @entity16			1
' the contract added ' all elements of performance , including without limitation wardrobe , shall be consistent with such goodwill and reputation			0
' the @entity16 filed their complaint with the @entity124 in march 2012 , despite broadcaster @entity125 and the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) both saying they would take no further action			2
the complaint calls the middle - finger an ' offensive gesture ' which is ' in flagrant disregard for the values that form the cornerstone of the @entity16 brand and the @entity7			1
' the singer - best known for the hit song @entity138 - flipped her middle finger and swore into the camera during her rap solo as over 100 million fans around the world watched the performance			1
while all eyes were on @entity13 during the now infamous performance back in 2012 , broadcasters were caught by surprise by the singer and scrambled to obscure the gesture in time			2
the screen briefly went blurry in what seemed like a late attempt to cut out the camera shot and @entity13 , who at this point was lying on her back behind the rapper , appearing blissfully unaware of the controversial move			1
the @entity16 , which produces the show , and the broadcaster , @entity125 , both apologised immediately but blamed each other for the incident			2
fighting back : @entity2 's lawyer , @entity166 , last week said that his client was planning to fight back against the @entity16 who imposed the fine @entity170 , the league 's vice president of communications , said : ' there was a failure in @entity125 's delay system			1
' the obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate , very disappointing , and we apologize to our fans			0
' @entity125 's spokesperson countered : ' the @entity16 hired the talent and produced the half - time show			1
' our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers			0
' shortly after the performance , a source inside @entity2 's camp claimed the rapper was struck with ' a case of adrenaline and nerves			2
' ' she was n't thinking , ' said the source , who requested anonymity but was with the artist at @entity195			0
' it was n't any kind of statement			0
' she was caught in the moment and she 's incredibly sorry			0
' the controversy mirrors that caused by @entity79 's ' wardrobe malfunction ' during the 2004 show , which put @entity93 in hot water with the @entity95			0
the singer was performing with @entity86 when he ripped open her costume to expose her breast for nine - sixteenths of a second , a moment for which @entity93 was fined $ 550,000 by the @entity95 .			0

@entity10 artist @entity2 raised her middle finger during 2012 @entity7 show
she also swore to the camera while singing with @entity13 and @entity14
@entity16 handed 38 - year - old rapper a $ 1.5m ' breach of contract ' fine
now demanding additional $ 15.1m by treating appearance as a tv ad
