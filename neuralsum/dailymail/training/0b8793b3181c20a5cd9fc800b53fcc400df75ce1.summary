' @entity3 forces carried out a lightening military campaign in @entity4 , forcing a terrorist army to retreat , and now mr @entity2 has pledged that his military will withdraw by march			1
this has led to mr @entity2 being described as a ' liberator ' by ordinary @entity4			2
the @entity70 had no immediate comment on the camel scandal , which came as the country ’s defence minister announced that it has killed hundreds of militants in @entity4			1
@entity77 also told a @entity3 radio station that the conflict was a ‘ real war with terrorists ’			0
