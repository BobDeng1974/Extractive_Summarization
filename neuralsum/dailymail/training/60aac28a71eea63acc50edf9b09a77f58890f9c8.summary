by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has defended @entity5 ’s much - derided approach to the one - day game — and @entity8 ’s role — but refused to rule out changes before the @entity10			1
the fourth one - day international at @entity11 today provides @entity5 with their last chance to avoid losing a series against @entity14 that represented their first step in another attempt to conquer the world in 50 - over cricket			1
so far it could not have gone much worse , two heavy defeats allowing @entity14 to turn the tables after their @entity23 embarrassment , while leaving @entity5 fighting to counter accusations that they are playing a different , outdated game			1
work to do : @entity5 coach @entity3 has admitted his side must improve before the @entity10 preparation : @entity5 train at @entity11 on the eve of the fourth one - day international against @entity14 relaxed : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 laugh during practice @entity3 , the @entity5 coach , remains convinced @entity8 is the best man to lead @entity5 towards the @entity10 while the search for the right formula and personnel for a tilt at an elusive first @entity10 triumph goes on			1
‘ we ’re going to find out as we go along , ’ said @entity3 on whether @entity5 have their balance right , providing hope to @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			2
‘ @entity8 is hungry and his form is starting to come back			2
we saw it in the test series and now we ’re starting to see it in the one - dayers			0
‘ it does n’t mean he ’s where he wants to be , and neither are we as a side , but when @entity60 ’s in form he ’s got his way of playing that can be effective in one - day cricket			1
his record matches a lot of other people ’s and his conversion rate is pretty high , with five hundreds and 19 half - centuries in 80 - odd games			0
’ decisions : @entity5 coach @entity71 said there could be changes as the @entity10 approaches glum : @entity5 trail @entity14 2 - 0 in the @entity78 one - day international series with two games to play dominant : @entity14 followed up their huge win in @entity82 with another thrashing at @entity84 but unless @entity5 show signs of genuine improvement in the last two matches of this series — and in @entity90 in november — time will be running out for the @entity10			1
the main accusation is that @entity5 are too old - fashioned in trying to build a platform before leaving acceleration to the likes of @entity35 and @entity95			2
@entity3 said : ‘ we know we have to get the right score when we bat in one - day games but there are different ways of reaching it			1
we have people in our squad who can score at a very high rate , @entity105 at the top and people like @entity35 and @entity95			0
‘ but you still have to get in and build			0
each side is made up of players who strike faster and some who are solid			0
we ’ve got to get the balance right , but we ’ve got to work fast			0
we ’re not going to hide			0
crossing the boundary : @entity33 , pictured fielding in training , has been out of form this summer options : @entity117 ( left ) could bolster @entity5 's batting while @entity119 ( right ) could return to the team fast and fearsome : @entity122 impressed on his return to the international scene after a year away ‘ when people say , “ you ’re going back to how @entity5 played in the past ” , that ’s not our view			2
we ’re clear on our strategy but we have to find the right people to put that in place			0
one - day cricket is not as simple as people going out and whacking it			2
even the best sides do n’t just do that			0
’ for now , the best @entity5 can do is give chances to @entity140 , who averages more than 50 in domestic one - day cricket , and @entity117 to try to give their batting a much - needed boost against @entity14 .			1

@entity5 trail @entity14 2 - 0 in @entity78 one - day international series
@entity8 's side must win remaining two games to draw the series
@entity14 followed up huge win in @entity82 with another thrashing at @entity84
@entity3 says there could be changes ahead of @entity10 in *february*
