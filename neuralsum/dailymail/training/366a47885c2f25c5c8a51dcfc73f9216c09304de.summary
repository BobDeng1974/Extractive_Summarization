by @entity0 published : 04:05 est , 30 april 2013 @entity2 : 19:47 est , 30 april 2013 when @entity4 and @entity5 decided to give their pink cottage a lick of paint , they did n’t anticipate it would leave council officials seeing red			1
the couple have been threatened with court action and told they should have got planning permission before painting the @entity18 - listed building			1
but they insist the 17th century cottage in @entity21 , @entity22 , is the same colour as when they bought it 12 years ago			1
they claim it looks no different today mrs @entity26 said : ‘ other residents around us all had their paintwork done and it made ours look shabby			1
' so we spent nearly £ 1,000 renewing ours in the same colour , pink			2
before the paint had even dried we had someone from the council come round			2
’ the retired dance teacher added that the council had received only one complaint – from a neighbour who did not overlook the property			2
the couple say that @entity49 in @entity22 have threatened legal action after a single complaint about the shade of paint used on @entity54 , which they say should be lighter			1
@entity56 is a common colour on houses of this age and type all over the @entity61			0
particulars : the @entity63 are using the details of their 2001 purchase as evidence to back their claims it looks no different mrs @entity26 added : ' i have pictures of the cottage painted in pink when we moved in and on the estate agent 's details			1
' just one person has complained			0
he does not live within viewing distance of the house and has to physically walk around just to see it			0
' then i received a letter from @entity81 saying i had to apply for planning permission			1
' i have now put in planning permission for pink			1
it is certainly not a shocking pink , it is a bit lighter than before			2
i am devastated and heartbroken by what has happened , ' said the retired dance teacher			1
the council has the power to make them paint it again if they are still unhappy , which could be another shade of pink			1
the @entity5 family say the three bedroom cottage was pink when they bought it for £ 130,000 12 years ago and took photos of it at the time which prove it is still the same colour			2
they have received backing from local @entity106 councillor @entity105 , who has intervened on their behalf			0
' i think the council is demonstrating the worst of being a @entity111 , ' he said			2
' mrs @entity26 is being put through the bureaucratic mangle because she painted her cottage the same colour			1
' @entity81 had just one complaint and the parish council raised no objection at all			0
' council officers could be spending their time chasing really serious planning breaches and protecting listed buildings in real danger			2
' traditional : @entity4 's @entity122 is a pink traditionally used on homes of a similar age all over the @entity61 argument : @entity26 and her husband @entity127 say their @entity18 listed home has not changed at all row : there has been one complaint about the colour of the house is @entity131 , @entity22 ( pictured ) , and the council has taken that on towards court but council bosses say they are following a standard procedure			1
a @entity49 spokeswoman said : ' in november 2011 we received a formal complaint regarding the colour of the @entity18 listed cottage in @entity21			0
our planning and conservation officers visited and carried out a site inspection			0
' we advised the owner that @entity149 ( @entity149 ) was required			0
this is needed before any alterations are made to listed buildings that affect its character or appearance			0
we also advised that enforcement action could be taken if an application was not received of the alteration was not reversed			0
' a retrospective @entity149 application was lodged on april 23			0
the application will now go through the usual planning procedures and will be open to comments from everyone , including people living nearby , statutory consultees and anyone else who may wish to put forward a view			0
a decision is due to be made in june			0

owners say that the shade of pink used is exactly the same as before
@entity22 council say they need planning permission or they could face court
owner @entity26 : ' i *'m* devastated and heartbroken by what 's happened '
