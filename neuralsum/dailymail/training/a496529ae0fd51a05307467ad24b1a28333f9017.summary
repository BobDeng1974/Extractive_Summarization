@entity1 gunnery sergeant @entity0 was deployed as a bomb technician in @entity3 in 2011 when the device he was defusing exploded prematurely			1
the then 29 - year - old @entity1 was ripped apart by the blast			1
he lost his right leg above the knee , his right hand above the wrist and three fingers of his left hand			0
while still receiving treatment on the battlefield , @entity14 , fearful of the impact his injuries would have on his squad , ordered @entity18 to take his photograph			1
forcing a smile through the pain , @entity14 , raised what would have earlier been a thumbs ' up as the shutter clicked			1
the photograph , @entity14 hoped , would provide inspiration for his men as he began his own battle with recovery			1
the special laser , pictured , softens scar tissue on @entity14 's arm allowing him greater movement and less pain @entity14 said he did not want special ramps fitted to his home or be confined to a wheelchair , instead he vowed to walk again and maintain an active lifestyle since the @entity57 and the invasions of @entity59 and @entity3 , almost 2,000 @entity56 troops have lost one or more limbs as a result of combat injuries			1
now , the @entity63 has embarked on a six - year study , to help wounded warriors rebuild their lives			1
so far , 1,500 personnel have signed up to the @entity68 , however , the @entity42 wants to increase that figure to 10,000			1
in addition to the amputees , a further 50,000 people have suffered serious combat injuries while deployed in either @entity59 or @entity3			2
a staggering 16,000 of them would not have survived in an earlier conflict			0
doctors say a positive attitude is key to recovery , so the study will also examine mental resilience and why some troops have it and others do n't			2
it will rely on web - based , telephone and mailed surveys conducted every six months about mobility , ability to function and social activity			2
the aim of the study is to review how veterans cope and enjoy life after suffering debilitating injuries such as @entity14			1
it is expected to last six years and will help understand how the injured personnel 's quality of life impacts their long - term care			1
troops such as @entity14 are pushing military medicine to find better ways to accommodate such a large population of young , severely disabled combat veterans who want to maintain an active lifestyle			1
many wear out their prosthetic limbs in a matter of months doing everything from mountain climbing to running marathons			0
among the projects @entity14 is involved with is warfighter made , which customises sports cars , off - roaders and motorbikes for wounded veterans			1
he said : ' what we want is for a guy in the coolest car to drive up to a handicap spot and have people like , " what 's this guy doing ? " then they see him get out with his prosthetic legs			0
' @entity14 has no regrets having ordered @entity18 to take the the battlefield photograph showing his horrendous injuries , instead looks at it with a certain amount of pride : ' it 's the exact opposite of what somebody expects you to do			1
so when i show it to people they are inspired by it , instead of being shocked , i know they get it ' commander @entity41 , chief of dermatology at the @entity145 in @entity44 pioneered some of the techniques being used on severely injured veterans , he said : ' it 's a privilege to work with soldiers and @entity1 , like @entity0 , because they 're young and motivated and healthy and they can go farther than we ever thought ' @entity14 is not yet part of the study but intends to participate			1
his case was featured in the @entity155 in may to demonstrate the success of battlefield trauma care over the past decade			2
the retired @entity1 has benefited from a host of new medical strategies used by the military , including laser treatments			1
@entity41 , chief of dermatology at @entity165 , helped pioneer the use of an ablative laser - commonly used to smooth wrinkled or acne - scarred skin - to ease @entity14 's scar tissue , dramatically improving the range of motion in his fingers , among other things			1
he said : ' it 's a privilege to work with soldiers and @entity1 , like @entity0 , because they 're young and motivated and healthy and they can go farther than we ever thought , ' they do n't want to just walk , they want to do things that their colleagues are doing , their friends are doing			1
' @entity14 was hospitalised for a month after the 2011 bomb blast in @entity3			1
he lost his right leg above the knee , and his right hand above the wrist			0
early during his rehabilitation , @entity14 rejected offers of installing ramps at his home as he wanted to lead as full a life as possible claiming ' i focus on what i have left , not what i lost ' only his pinky and ring finger remained intact on his left hand			1
after multiple surgeries , he was outfitted for prosthetics and learned to walk again			0
but @entity14 , 29 at the time , wanted full independence			1
he turned down offers to install wheelchair ramps in his home			0
he debated before accepting a handicap parking permit			0
he did not want to avoid the struggle to reintegrate			0
he wanted to go anywhere			0
he said : ' i focus on what i have left , not what i lost			0
his prosthetic arm has a flashlight so at night he can see where he plants his prosthetic foot			0
his prosthetic arm has the knobs and battery pack positioned to one side so he can shoot a bow and arrow			0
thanks to the laser treatments on his scar tissue , he can now hold a toothbrush , write with a pen , dial his phone , and pull the trigger of a hunting rifle			0
laser treatments also removed a sore , allowing him to withstand his prosthetic leg for 18 hours a day			0
@entity41 and dr. @entity226 , who recently retired from @entity227 , helped pioneer the method			0
@entity226 also discovered botulinum toxin a injections decrease perspiration where the prosthetic limb attaches , helping stop it from slipping off while the person is exercising or in hot climates			0
the findings were recently presented to the @entity236 to promote the treatment for severely scarred people in the general population			0
@entity41 said : ' these are not special , scar lasers or special , wounded warrior lasers			2
we 've taken these techniques that are primarily used for cosmetic purposes and altered them a bit to apply to trauma rehabilitation			2
' such unconventional treatments make a big difference in daily life , veterans and their doctors say			2
one soldier 's scar tissue has softened so he can grasp his daughter 's hand ; another can now type			0
a week after a recent treatment , @entity14 rode on his motorcycle through a shopping district in @entity262 , 60 miles northeast of @entity44			1
his pinky and ring finger operated the throttle that has been put on the left side because he only has a left wrist			0
it has a side car that can carry another amputee , wheelchair or his dog			0
@entity14 and two others have started the nonprofit organisation , @entity275 made , which modified his motorcycle			2
it also customises sports cars , off - road vehicles and other transportation for veterans , who can join in the work			1
' what we want is for a guy in the coolest car to drive into a handicap spot and have people be like , " what 's this guy doing ? " then they see him get out with his prosthetic legs , ' said @entity14			2
his prosthetic leg features a sticker of @entity295 and the word ' laugh			0
' @entity14 works for the @entity297 , counseling fellow combat veterans			1
he loves the photograph taken after he was injured			2
he said : ' it 's the exact opposite of what somebody expects you to do			0
so when i show it to people and they are inspired by it , instead of being shocked , i know they get it			0
' due to the revolutionary laser treatment which softened his scars , @entity14 is able to operate the controls of his motorbike using the two fingers of his left hand			2
