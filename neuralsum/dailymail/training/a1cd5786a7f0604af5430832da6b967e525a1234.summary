she 's been a racehorse owner for more than 60 years , breeds @entity3 ponies at @entity4 and hosts a horse show at @entity6 each year			0
and it seems the @entity9 's love of all things equine has proved equal to the demands of advancing age , after she was photographed trotting around the @entity6 estate this morning			1
perched on the back of her current mount , @entity19 pony @entity18 , the monarch looked on spritely form as she enjoyed the june sunshine , her trademark headscarf firmly in place			1
good day for a gallop : the @entity9 riding her @entity19 pony @entity18 in @entity26 this morning although approaching 90 , the @entity9 continues to ride out every morning - a longstanding habit begun when she was given @entity29 mare , @entity30 , aged four			1
since then , the royal stables have seen a succession of steeds , among them @entity35 , a black farm - bred horse who was the @entity9 's mount of choice in the 50s , and @entity41 , a grey gelding whom the @entity9 famously galloped down the course at @entity45 in 1961			1
but while her penchant for riding is well known , her career as a racehorse breeder is legendary and spans more than 60 years			0
beginning with the handful that she inherited on the death of her father @entity53 , the @entity9 's horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races , including all five @entity56 classics , with the exception of the @entity58			0
the @entity58 , which takes place on saturday , has so far eluded the @entity9 , although she did have a second place finish in 1953 and managed third place in 2011			0
riding : the @entity9 has a longstanding habit of riding out in the morning at @entity6 , and is pictured here in 1961 celebration : the @entity9 celebrated her 50th birthday with a trot through the grounds at @entity6 favourite : @entity9 , pictured here with @entity69 , on her beloved @entity71 horse , @entity72 along with @entity45 , the @entity9 never misses a @entity58 meeting and will be at the race on saturday , where she will , in keeping with tradition , congratulate the winner from the royal box			1
while the @entity58 has so far eluded her , the @entity9 has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the @entity56 , among them @entity81 who managed to win both the @entity83 and @entity84 in 1977 , @entity85 , who triumphed in the @entity83 in 1957 and @entity86 who took the @entity88 in 1958			2
last year , her filly estimate romped home to take the prestigious @entity91 at @entity45 - much to the delight of the monarch			1
despite her love of racing , the @entity9 no longer rides her mettlesome thoroughbreds herself or , indeed , any of the more spirited breeds occupying the royal stables			2
instead , much of her time is devoted to breeding docile @entity19 ponies , among them her current mount , @entity18 , from the royal stud at @entity104			1
the @entity105 is part of the @entity107 and will be broadcast live on saturday 7th june by @entity108			0

feisty : although now confined to ponies , the @entity9 once rode fiery breeds such as this thoroughbred in 1997 relaxed : the @entity9 's favourite ride takes her along the banks of the @entity116 which runs near @entity6 ancient : the stocky @entity19 pony has roamed @entity56 vales for more than two millennia one of the oldest equine breeds on the planet , @entity19 ponies like the @entity9 's mount @entity18 , have roamed the moors of @entity126 since the @entity128 period			1
docile , hardy and thick - set , the majority of @entity19 ponies are black , grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh			2
highly prized by the @entity135 , the @entity137 tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago , the ponies later caught the eye of the invading @entity141 and were used as trade goods all over the @entity143			0
the @entity141 also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today			2
originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall ( similar to @entity148 and @entity149 ponies ) , by the end of the @entity152 period , the average @entity19 was more than a hand higher			0
another invader to fall in love with the @entity19 pony was the @entity157 , who used the animals as pack ponies ; a use continued by the @entity162			2
by the 13th century , the @entity19 's usefulness as a pack animal was well - established and the pony played an important role in @entity56 trade until the end of the 18th century			1
following the @entity170 , @entity169 were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town , as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed			0
although previously used in trotting races , the @entity19 pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s , when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families			0
today , the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages , among them the @entity9 who breeds @entity19 ponies from her @entity104 stud			1
