by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 ’ natural response to the intruder he believed had broken into his home the night he killed girlfriend @entity6 would be to fire his gun , rather than flee , according to an expert			1
speaking for the defence on day 37 of the paralympian ’s murder trial in @entity12 , @entity13 , a professor of sport and exercise at the @entity16 , said that for @entity3 ‘ to flee is not an option because the individual does not have lower legs ’			1
@entity13 added that @entity3 is a ' paradox ' whose racing triumphs contrast sharply with the severe limitations of his disability			2
he said the contrast likely contributed to stress and anxiety for @entity3			2
@entity3 maintains that when he fired his gun through the bathroom door of his home on february 14 , 2013 , killing @entity6 , he thought he was shooting an intruder			1
he previously told the trial : ‘ i was not thinking - i just fired			0
’ professor @entity13 told the court he found @entity3 to be ' hyper - vigilant ' and was restless , often looking around quickly and scanning for possible threats			2
' he is an anxious individual , ' @entity13 said			0
he also noted that @entity3 has a hand tremor as well as a sleep disorder that required medication			2
the defense wants to show that the athlete had a deep sense of vulnerability and it was a factor in the ' mistaken shooting '			1
chief prosecutor @entity59 during cross-examination argued that @entity13 's testimony is likely to be biased because as a physician he is obligated to ' act in the best interests of his patients '			0
@entity13 countered that he has backed up all his points with scientific facts			0
' the truth would come before my patient , ' @entity13 said			0
@entity59 said : ' you can not give evidence against your patient , sir			0
' he went on to claim that @entity13 was giving ' character evidence ' rather than ' expert evidence '			0
he suggested on thursday that @entity3 acted methodically on the night he killed @entity6 because he had to locate his gun , which was not where he normally kept it , then take the weapon out of its holster and then move down a passage from the bedroom to the bathroom while scanning for the perceived threat			1
' the accused was careful before he entered the passage , ' @entity59 said			0
the trial heard earlier that @entity3 does not display the narcissism associated with men in abusive relationships and linked to ' rage - type ' murders , according to a psychologist 's report			1
the report adds to conflicting evidence about the character of the double - amputee runner			0
preparation : @entity3 has his tie adjusted by his uncle @entity100 , right , in court during his ongoing murder trial in @entity12 on thursday @entity103 , one of the defence lawyers of @entity106 paralympian @entity3 , gestures as he speaks during his client 's murder trial at the @entity109 in @entity12 the defense has sought to support @entity3 ' contention that he killed the 29 - year - old model by mistake , fearing an intruder was about to attack him ; the prosecution says the paralympian is a jealous egotist who shot @entity6 after a @entity119 argument			1
dr. @entity121 , a clinical psychologist , found no evidence that @entity3 had a history of ' abnormal aggression or explosive violence ' but concluded he has a record of feeling insecure and vulnerable , particularly when he is without his prosthetic limbs , defense lawyer @entity120 said			2
he read excerpts from the psychological report , part of a court - ordered evaluation of @entity3 ' state of mind over 30 days at a state psychiatric hospital			2
the evaluation , which included a separate report by three psychiatrists , said @entity3 was not mentally ill when he killed @entity6			1
that conclusion appeared to remove the possibility that @entity3 could be declared not guilty by reason of mental illness			2
on wednesday , his defense team tried to show that the psychologist 's report supports the paralympian 's account of a mistaken shooting because his disability and purported fear of crime contributed to a heightened sense of vulnerability			1
trial : a supporter hugs @entity3 on wednesday at the court in @entity12 when physically threatened , @entity3 might have a fearful reaction that could ' seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of an able - bodied person , but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history , ' said @entity120 , quoting from the report			1
the lawyer also cited the psychologist as saying @entity3 has become severely traumatized since the killing and will become an increasing suicide risk unless he continues to get mental health care			0
at times during his trial , @entity3 has wailed and retched in apparent distress , particularly during graphic testimony about the shooting and also when the athlete was on the witness stand			1
at other times , he has been calm and taken notes			0
@entity59 has suggested @entity3 feigned distress in order to dodge a tough cross-examination ; the athlete 's camp has denied his emotional displays were fake			0
@entity59 has portrayed @entity3 as a reckless narcissist with a penchant for gunplay and driving at high speeds			0
he has highlighted arguments between the runner and @entity6 in the weeks before he killed her , though the defense has said most of their communication was normal and affectionate			1
@entity3 , who is free on bail , faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder , but he could also be sentenced to a shorter prison term if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing			1
additionally , he faces separate gun - related charges .			0
