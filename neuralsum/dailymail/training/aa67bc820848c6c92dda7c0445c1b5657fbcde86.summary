@entity0 has agreed that @entity1 is now his heir			1
former @entity3 legend and @entity6 @entity5 winner @entity2 believes @entity1 is now better than @entity0 and even @entity7			1
' for some time i have thought that @entity0 could never be surpassed , and nor could @entity7 , but no longer			2
i would now say that @entity1 will go down in history as the no.1 player of all time , the best that there ever was , ' said @entity14			1
right path : @entity1 has inspired @entity16 to two victories in @entity18 @entity19 : @entity0 led @entity16 to @entity5 glory in @entity21 in 1986 @entity22 : @entity1 ' yes , i would now say that @entity1 is the very best , but of course you would wonder just how much better @entity0 or @entity7 would have been if they had the advantage of such advancements in the game			1
' but for many it will only be if @entity1 can lead @entity16 to victory at a @entity5 that he will be regarded in such esteem as @entity0			1
after flopping at the last @entity5 , @entity1 is on the right path having scored two superb individual goals to seal successive victories and could well further stamp his personality on this tournament against @entity38			1
in that respect , @entity1 has started better in terms of goals than @entity0 did in 1986 , who only scored one goal at the group stage in a draw against @entity46			1
he then struck his two ' beast and beauty ' goals against @entity50 in the quarter final and then two more in the 2 - 0 semi final win over @entity53 , although he did n’t score in the 3 - 2 final win over @entity55			1
@entity56 will he hoping to fill his boots in the race for the golden boot			2
the @entity61 striker , who could be up for grabs this summer , currently trails @entity18 's @entity63 , who is now on four , by one goal			1
but if @entity66 stay in free - scoring mode against @entity68 then @entity65 would expect to be on the score sheet			2
free - scoring : @entity66 , and three - goal striker @entity56 , have impressed in @entity18 if he does strike he will become only the second @entity66 to score four goals at a single @entity5			1
but he will have a long way to go to catch the last @entity66 striker to pass that mark			2
he was @entity74 who in the 1958 finals hit a staggering 13 goals which remains the record			1
@entity38 need a point against @entity16 to guarantee a place in the knockout stage			1
if defensive resolve is required then @entity38 have shown it thus far			2
their goalkeeper @entity83 of @entity85 in @entity66 is so far the top graded keeper in the tournament according to @entity88 stats which give a 100 per cent record with two clean sheets and eight saves			0
@entity92 need to beat @entity93 and hope @entity38 slip up to progress			0
the @entity95 , managed by former @entity97 assistant coach @entity96 , certainly have the mentality and tactical nous to take it to the wire			0
their midfield general @entity101 will be key , not least given his vast experience			0
this will be his 143rd cap which puts him 21st in the all time list			0
experience : @entity92 's @entity101 will win his 143rd cap against @entity93 on wednesday the most capped player of all time is @entity110 of @entity111 with 184			1
@entity115 keeper @entity114 is @entity116 ’s most capped player with 156 , @entity55 ’s @entity112 , who played in five @entity113 , is @entity116 ’s most capped outfield players with 150			0
the notion that @entity120 referees are more lenient than their continental counterparts and turn a blind eye to certain types of robust challenges does not appear to stand up judging on how games have been officiated far			2
a perception that in the main refs at the @entity5 have , where possible , let games flow and have not been rushed into issuing cards is backed up by statistics			1
last season in the @entity120 the ratio of yellow cards was one per 6.8 fouls			0
thus far in @entity18 it has been one booking per 10.8 fouls			0
one to watch : @entity137 need to beat @entity138 and hope that @entity66 remain focused and do n’t lose to @entity68			0
watch out for left footed striker @entity139 who can fire @entity137 into the next phase			0
the @entity142 player has long been admired by several @entity120 clubs and could be up for grabs following the arrival this summer of @entity147 ’s @entity146			0
i say : there are many reasons why @entity50 flopped at this @entity5			1
but one of the most obvious but least debated is the simple fact @entity50 did n’t score enough goals			2
there can be endless debates about tactics , pass completions , defensive frailties , sport psychology and so on but if the you do n’t stick the ball in the old onion bag … and there were ample chances against @entity165 and @entity166 … you are not going to win			0
and so @entity50 come home with just one point			0
two goals - equalisers by @entity170 v @entity46 and @entity171 v @entity165 - was never going to be enough			2
@entity172 return home with the worst record just one , while @entity68 and @entity93 are both on one goal but can add to their total			0
it ’s enhances the argument that @entity180 should have taken at least one more striker … @entity183 or @entity184 … especially as @entity182 was never going to be fit			0
grounded : @entity184 was not included in @entity50 's squad for the finals @entity5 moment : @entity66 have so far surprised given the downbeat attitude of manager @entity189 ahead of the tournament			1
they might not be quite the elegant side of 1998 but they have been full of attacking menace and goals			2
for me the most memorable moment of their 3 - 0 final win over @entity18 was @entity201 ’s 27th minute bullet header			0
@entity202 : @entity66 @entity203 : @entity65 and @entity1 are both 5 - 1 to score on wednesday night			1
@entity38 , @entity16 , @entity68 and @entity66 all to score is 12 - 1			1
a draw between @entity93 and @entity92 is 23/10			0
@entity171 is 1 - 5 to be next @entity50 captain @entity205 is 9 - 2 .			0

@entity1 has already scored *crucial* goals in both of @entity16 's first two @entity5 games
the @entity211 star is regarded as one of the best ever **football*ers*
many argue that @entity1 must lead @entity16 to @entity5 glory before cementing his legacy as *football* 's *greatest*
