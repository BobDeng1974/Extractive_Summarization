by @entity1 reporter published : 19:46 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 12:25 est , 2 december 2012 dolphins might be playful creatures , but they can also play rough			2
a hungry dolphin bit an 8 - year - old girl at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , last week as she was feeding it scraps of fish			1
@entity11 of @entity12 suffered three puncture wounds the size of dimes and a swollen left hand after the unexpected biting occurred , her parents told the @entity18			1
@entity30 posted the video online as a warning to other parents			1
‘ the first thing i thought was i would have to jump in water and save my daughter 's life , ’ he told the @entity18			0
‘ i literally thought she was going to be pulled into the water			0
’ his daughter ’s cuts are healing , he said , but @entity30 and his wife are upset with the way @entity22 employees handled the incident , saying they trivialized the severity of it			1
surprise bite : the dolphin bit @entity11 , clamping down on her left wrist painful moment : @entity11 cringes as the dolphin bites down harder strong pull : the dolphin nearly drags @entity11 into the water with it while dolphins are known for their playful behaviour and permanently painted smiles , they are also known for their sheer physical power and sharp teeth which have led to attacks on humans			1
human feeding is linked behind many reported attacks though other incidents have been seen during moments of sexual aggression			2
federal officials say dolphins are of little threat to people in captive swim programs - with in 1994 less than 1 out of 10,000 people injured - but those animals in the wild are far more spontaneous and unpredictable in their behaviour			2
earlier this year in @entity85 a single wild dolphin was reported terrorizing residents in a waterside community in @entity88 where it bit three people in june			2
in one incident a boater 's hand was sliced open by the dolphin 's teeth while he stuck his hand in the water to clean it			1
in another case a girl was dragged into the water by her ankle			0
other reports described the dolphin as head butting and chasing acquaintances			2
like many other incidents , officials in @entity85 said there were related reports of people feeding the dolphin and attempting to lure it out with food potentially leading to its association of all humans having food			1
‘ thank @entity120 it did n’t pull her in the water			0
it ’s only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured at this attraction , ’ @entity30 wrote in a message at the end of his video			0
this is n’t the first dolphin bite the park has seen			0
in 2006 , two adults pried open a dolphin 's mouth to free a 7 - year - old boy from its grip , which left a bruise on the boy ’s hand , according to another @entity18 article			0
@entity22 spokesperson @entity139 at the time told the @entity18 that no changes were being planned for the attraction			1
@entity144 ’s mother , @entity143 , said she would have been more careful if she had known her daughter might get bitten			0
‘ i felt safe , ’ she said			0
‘ everyone just imagines dolphins as smiling , non-biting animals with knobby teeth			0
you forget these are wild animals			0
’ the @entity30 family said they do not plan to take legal action against the @entity7 - based theme park , but said they would like @entity6 to increase the age limit for children feeding dolphins and remind parents that dolphins are n’t always as friendly as they look			1
@entity22 did not return requests for comment from @entity162			2
