rampant @entity0 aims to destroy the @entity1 , take over a new right - wing @entity3 political party , get @entity3 out of the @entity4 - and then quit politics			1
the @entity8 leader ’s breathtaking ambition , revealed in an interview with @entity10 , comes hours before he is set to achieve a historic victory in the @entity13 elections			1
the results from thursday ’s polling , announced today , are expected to show @entity8 will have gained more than 20 meps , more than the @entity17 , with the possibility of a total wipeout of all @entity20			1
the @entity8 leader hopes to have @entity3 out of @entity13 within a decade mr @entity0 rejects claims by @entity29 that @entity8 ’s challenge will fade away in next year ’s general election , and says today ’s gains @entity32 of the @entity1			1
he aims to repeat the destruction two decades ago of @entity35 ’s @entity1 , when the rebel right - wing @entity36 , compared by many to @entity8 , sparked a political earthquake			1
in an interview with this newspaper earlier in the campaign , mr @entity0 said a @entity35 - style @entity1 meltdown ‘ could happen ’ here – and compared attacks on him to those on @entity36 leader @entity47 and @entity36 ’s first @entity35 mp , schoolteacher @entity48			1
‘ they called him a right - wing extremist , a nutter , away with the fairies , he ’ll never get anywhere and what happens ? they won one by - election , a schoolmistress @entity57 , who resisted every bribe and temptation to rejoin the @entity1			1
‘ now you have a @entity35 prime minister , @entity62 , who was first elected on a reform ticket , as were half the @entity64			0
‘ do n’t think this ca n’t happen here			0
the public want something different			0
we are catalysing a big change in @entity3 politics on fundamental issues that have been brushed under the carpet and ignored by a completely out - of - touch career political class for too long			1
’ ambition : @entity0 dismissed jibes that the rise of @entity8 will hand power to @entity81 @entity80 at the next general election by taking votes from the @entity84 @entity35 ’s @entity1 was destroyed overnight in the country ’s 1993 election by the populist , low - tax , @entity36			1
the century - old ruling @entity17 lost all but two of their 156 seats after sensational gains by @entity36 , which had been called racist , sexist and homophobic , just as @entity29 famously called @entity8 ‘ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’			1
the split in @entity35 ’s @entity96 enabled the @entity97 , @entity35 ’s equivalent of our @entity99 , to take power			0
but after ten years of infighting , the @entity36 revolution succeeded			0
the @entity104 , a merger of @entity36 with the ruins of @entity35 ’s old - style @entity84 , led to former reform official @entity62 becoming prime minister in 2006			2
and it had all started with the victory of a sole reform mp , ms @entity48 , in 1989			2
mr @entity0 hopes a victory by @entity8 ’s @entity112 in the @entity113 by - election on june 5 will trigger a similar political shake - up at @entity116			1
in his interview with @entity10 , mr @entity0 dismissed jibes that the rise of @entity8 will hand power to @entity81 @entity80 at the next general election by taking votes from the @entity84			1
he said : ‘ the arithmetic does n’t suggest that			0
firstly , the reason @entity1 voters have deserted the party is that they do not believe @entity29 is conservative			1
it ’s got nothing to do with me , but thinking there is going to be a @entity1 majority is fantasy			1
‘ the second reason is the @entity84 are dying as brand in the @entity135 just as they did in scotland.the third reason @entity29 ca n’t win a majority is he ca n’t get the blue - collar vote			1
@entity139 got it , @entity132 got it , @entity142 got it			0
but these two guys ( @entity29 and @entity145 ) who allegedly do n’t know the price of a pint of milk , do n’t connect with the blue collar			0
’ celebration : @entity0 aims to use @entity8 's new support from @entity99 voters to force a weakened @entity80 to take a tougher stance on the @entity4 in next year 's election while @entity0 says publicly an @entity80 victory next year would be a ‘ disaster for the economy , ’ some of those who know the @entity8 leader well claim that in private , he says it could help him achieve a @entity35 - style upheaval here			1
one @entity8 aide said : ‘ if @entity80 wins , the @entity84 would be shattered and split with @entity163 on one side and @entity165 on the other			1
@entity0 could team up with the @entity163 and possibly lead them			1
and , if , as @entity0 believes , @entity80 would be a pathetically poor pm , a @entity167 could collapse quickly with another election			1
then , the @entity35 scenario is on			0
’ mr @entity0 aims to use @entity8 ’s new support from @entity99 voters to force a weakened @entity80 to take a tougher stance on the @entity4 in next year ’s election			1
‘ if i want to get this country out of the @entity4 , i have got to change the position of the @entity99 on the referendum			2
if you accept it is impossible for @entity29 to win a majority on his own , there could be a @entity8 - @entity1 coalition after the election			1
who knows ? if it looks less and less likely that @entity80 can form a majority without a referendum pledge , he ’ll do it			2
’ @entity0 , 50 , insists he is not interested in power for himself – and by the time he turns 60 , wants to have quit politics – with @entity3 out of the @entity4			1
‘ i will consider my job ’s done and i would be very happy to hand over to people who might be very good at running the country			0
i ’m in politics because i want to change things , not because i want a career			2
i do n’t want to do this for ever , i do n’t want to sit here in ten years ’ time , i want to be doing something else by then , in the media , radio , writing , hopefully enjoying myself			2
’ he has no desire to move into @entity200 , emulating ‘ @entity35 ’s @entity0 ’ @entity62			2
‘ i think i could do it but do i think that ’s really what i would be best at in life ? ‘ no. what i ’m best at is spotting when something ’s wrong and needs to change and agitating to wake people up to what ’s gone wrong			0
’ pressure on embattled @entity80 grew last night after a survey showed @entity99 would have more chance of winning the next election if they dump him			2
a @entity216 poll for the @entity10 revealed that 31 per cent of @entity99 supporters back the party at the ballot box ‘ because of ’ @entity80 , while 36 per cent do so ‘ despite ’ him			2
by contrast , 48 per cent of @entity84 back the party because of @entity29 , and 18 per cent support the party despite him			0
the leadership popularity gap was repeated when voters were asked if they would be more likely to support a party if it had a new leader			2
voters said ‘ yes ’ by a margin of 26 per cent in the case of @entity99 , compared to a margin of 13 per cent for the @entity84			0
the most common criticism of @entity80 in the poll , which saw 1,017 adults questioned online on friday , is that he lacks charisma and the ‘ common touch ’			0
city slicker : @entity239 - suited @entity238 ( right ) has emerged as the surprise new favourite to succeed current @entity99 leader @entity80 ( left ) @entity29 was also seen as lacking the common touch but the prime minister fared significantly better on charisma			2
mr @entity80 will face further attacks today , with widespread forecasts of poor results in the @entity13 elections on top of similar disappointment in the town hall elections			1
the @entity99 leader , who has been criticised for failing to stop @entity8 taking votes in his party ’s @entity255 heartlands , is due to launch a fightback on tuesday			1
he will say in a speech : ‘ i am determined to show people , including those who voted for @entity8 , that we can change our country for the better			2
’ but a shadow minister said the attempt to win back voters was like ‘ bolting the stable door after the @entity8 horse has bolted ’			2
the poll also revealed that @entity269 is the strong favourite to succeed mr @entity29 , backed by 44 per cent of @entity84			0
he is followed by @entity271 and @entity145			0
energy secretary @entity272 has emerged as @entity20 favourite to succeed deputy prime minister @entity274 , with support from 32 per cent of the party ’s voters , followed by treasury chief secretary @entity278 with @entity279 a distant third place			0
meanwhile sharp - suited @entity238 has emerged as the surprise new favourite to succeed @entity80 , according to the poll			0
in previous surveys , @entity238 has lagged behind other @entity99 hopefuls			0
but those who voted in the @entity216 poll did so after watching videos of @entity80 ’s potential successors			0
the survey saw @entity291 , 35 , triumph over bookmakers ’ favourite @entity294 , the shadow home secretary			0
little - known @entity238 was seen as ‘ more charismatic , normal , in touch and trustworthy ’ among @entity99 supporters than any of his rival leadership contenders			0
asked who would be most likely to make them vote @entity99 , @entity238 won again , and he also stormed to victory in the ‘ better than @entity80 ’ category			0
dubbed the ‘ @entity302 ’ , @entity303 - trained lawyer @entity238 was fast - tracked into the @entity64			0
but his ‘ rising star ’ status has led to him being taunted by @entity29 and privately mocked by some of his @entity99 colleagues .			0
