@entity38 and @entity86 lost custody of their 16 - year - old daughter when she was diagnosed with a psychological disorder last year			1

' they told me that @entity170 did not exist , ' says @entity38 , a financial planner			0
' instead , they said she had @entity174 , which is effectively a stress - related mental problem			0

it was as though they were accusing us of needlessly harming our daughter			0
