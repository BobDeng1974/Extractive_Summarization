by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:10 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:09 est , 16 december 2013 it seems the baby of the family never grows up – at least in their mother ’s eyes			0
a study found that mothers routinely underestimate the height of their youngest child , in a phenomenon that may also explain why an older brother or sister often seems to grow up overnight on the birth of a sibling			1
the @entity18 researchers began by asking more than 700 mothers if their child had suddenly seemed bigger on the birth of a brother or sister			1
more than 70 per cent said this was the case			0
the study found most mothers underestimated the height of their youngest child by almost 3 inches but accurately estimated how tall their oldest child was to work out why , the @entity29 team asked a second group of women to estimate the height of one of their children and mark it on the wall			1
the children , aged between two and six , were then measured and the results compared with the estimates			2
mothers got the height of elder children roughly right , but underestimated the height of their youngest children by three inches on average			1
study author @entity46 said : ‘ the key implication is that we may treat our youngest child as if they are actually younger than they really are			0
‘ our research potentially explains why the “ baby of the family ” never outgrows the label			0
to the parents , the baby of the family may always be “ the baby ”			0
’ ’ the researchers say their results show the perception that the eldest child suddenly appears bigger on the birth of a second child can not simply be explained away by everything looking big compared to the newborn			0
@entity18 scientists set out to uncover why it feels to many parents that their firstborn seems suddenly grown - up and bigger once they have brought a newborn baby home instead , parents seems to be subject to a ‘ baby illusion ’ , in which they perceive the youngest child as being more fragile than he or she really is , and so the older child instantly seems bigger			1
the study ’s authors said : ‘ this is n’t happening just because the older child looks so big compared to the baby , it happens because all along the parents were under an illusion that their first child was smaller than he or she really was			1
' when the new baby is born , the spell is broken and parents see their older child as he or she really is			2
’ the journal @entity89 reports that the mental trick could be nature ’s way of ensuring the youngest child gets the care it needs when it is at its most vulnerable			2
however , the perception may last for years .			0

@entity18 scientists discovered that mothers could accurately estimate the height of their older children , but underestimated the size of their youngest
perception of the youngest being much smaller and fragile helps parents to focus on them and care for them more
