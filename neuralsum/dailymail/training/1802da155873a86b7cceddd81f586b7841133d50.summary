at may ’s @entity3 dinner held in honour of 2014 winner @entity5 , @entity1 manager @entity0 told an audience that he had been privileged to work with the @entity7 and spoke of the lengths the player had reached to improve his behaviour			1
what we know now , as many of us suspected back then , was that @entity5 had merely been fooling us all along			1
inside this gifted footballer ’s head is a brain that simply can not be rewired			2
towards the end of this awful game in the stifling heat of @entity20 on tuesday afternoon , i had found my mind wandering to the next steps in this competition			2
thoughts of thursday ’s @entity27 - @entity26 game and saturday ’s knockout tie between @entity29 and @entity30 had begun to occupy me			1
fooling us all : inside the head of @entity1 frontman @entity5 is a brain that simply can not be rewired stellar season : @entity0 ( left ) said it had been a privilege to work with @entity5 after the @entity1 frontman scooped the @entity38 's @entity37 ( right ) shocking : @entity5 appeared to bite @entity40 's shoulder during @entity42 's win over @entity43 on wednesday at the @entity44 in @entity29 painful : @entity5 holds his teeth in pain while @entity40 rolls around the floor in agony following the incident controversy : @entity5 holds his mouth after the incident , while @entity43 defender @entity40 shows the damage nonplussed : @entity5 ( left ) celebrates the 1 - 0 win with his team - mate @entity54 standing tall : @entity5 shows no sign that the clash with @entity40 is playing on his mind after the game @entity59 in another bite storm @entity44 has opened disciplinary proceedings , to which @entity42 and @entity5 have until 5pm local time ( 9pm bst ) on wednesday to provide evidence			1
a statement on @entity44 's website said : ' @entity44 can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the player @entity5 of @entity42 following an apparent breach of art. 48 and / or art. 57 of the @entity69 during the @entity72 @entity71 match @entity43 - @entity42 played on 24 june 2014			1
' the player and / or the @entity7 @entity74 are invited to provide with their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant until 25 june 2014 , 5pm , @entity79 time			2
' according to art. 77 lit. a of the @entity69 ( @entity81 ) , the @entity80 is responsible for sanctioning serious infringements which have escaped the match officials ' attention			2
' furthermore , according to art. 96 of the @entity81 , any type of proof may be produced ( par. 1 ) , in particular are admissible , reports from referees , declarations from the parties and witnesses , material evidence , audio or video recordings ( par. 3 )			2
' click here for the full story there was just not enough to hold the attention at the @entity101 two - thirds of the way through what had pretty quickly established itself as the worst game of this brilliant @entity44			1
@entity5 , though , changed all that and , just as it had been at @entity109 on april 22 2013 , he did so with absolutely no prior warning			1
this is the thing about the 27 - year - old that is so disconcerting			1
he does n’t do vicious , stupid things at the culmination of a festering dispute with opponents			2
' he does n’t do them as acts of retaliation			0
he just does them instinctively			0
for reasons that he probably does n’t even recognise himself , he just does them			0
i was at @entity109 14 months ago when @entity5 sank his teeth in to the arm of @entity126 of @entity127			1
my experience then ran parallel to my experience on monday			0
first of all , i missed it with my naked eye as i followed the ball elsewhere			0
then i saw the replays and suspected a head butt			0
then the astounding reality of the actual events became apparent			0
watch enough football and you will see just about everything eventually			0
there are only so many possible stories , after all			0
it ’s just the names that change			2
you become accustomed to the cheating , the sly violence , the diving , the moaning and the carping			0
controversy : @entity5 is captured biting @entity127 defender @entity126 in april 2012 bite night ! @entity126 explains what happened to the referee before @entity5 received a 10 - game ban ' these situations happen on the field			1
' i had contact with his shoulder , nothing more , things like that happen all the time			0
' i do n't know anything , if @entity44 analyse each case separately it 's going to be complicated			1
' i 'm very happy to qualify against a @entity165 team , after the first match against @entity168 it was difficult to reverse the situation but we played an incredible match today			0
' you think nothing shocks you but then something like this comes along and all that changes			0
this just does n’t happen in football			0
does it ? @entity5 , of course , now has a culinary crime sheet with three items on it			1
to the names of @entity187 ’s @entity186 ( november 2010 ) and @entity126 we can now add @entity43 ’s hulking great defender @entity188			1
this time , @entity5 has sinned on the greatest stage of them all			1
prior to this game on the north - east coast of @entity29 , @entity5 had chosen to take on the @entity194 media again			1
the sense of persecution he was encouraged to feel during his failed attempt to prove he did not racially abuse @entity199 ’s @entity198 back in 2011 had clearly not gone away			2
previous : @entity5 received a seven game ban for biting @entity187 's @entity186 while playing for @entity202 in 2010 ouch ! @entity186 shows the bite marks to a @entity187 teammate after the incident in april 2010 it was this warped sense of reality that @entity5 took with him in to this game			1
no matter what @entity0 has said to him – no matter the sessions he has had with @entity1 ’s psychologist @entity211 – @entity5 has still not fundamentally accepted his role in the two major controversies that have coloured his time in the @entity215			1
@entity5 is an angry , self - pitying delusionist lashing out , in word and deed			1
on monday he reacted to his assault on @entity40 by throwing himself to the ground			0
it was an act of inescapable guilt			0
holding his mouth immediately afterwards wo n’t help his cause when @entity44 investigate today either			2
after the final whistle , meanwhile , he hid his face with his shirt			0
it could have been emotion			0
it could have been relief at his side ’s qualification			2
it may just have been shame but i doubt it			0
cover up ? @entity5 holds his teeth in pain after the incident suggesting he collided with @entity188 no remorse : @entity5 is all smiles as he celebrates @entity42 's victory over @entity43 at the full - time whistle @entity43 0 - 1 @entity42 : @entity5 mars win after appearing to bite @entity188 during @entity243 showdown @entity5 appears to bite @entity188 to complete hat - trick at @entity44 ... after previously sinking his teeth into @entity126 and @entity245 @entity5 needs help , claims @entity248 boss @entity247 following @entity42 frontman 's bite on @entity188 @entity251 : @entity5 should be banned for the rest of the @entity44 after appearing to bite @entity43 defender @entity188 @entity188 : @entity5 is a sneak ... it was ridiculous not to send him off for biting me ! @entity5 plays down ' biting ' incident saying ' these situations happen ' and captain @entity258 even blames alleged bite victim @entity188 ! @entity5 may be a genius ... but , after latest biting controversy , at what point will football turn its back on him ? @entity264 : people will remember @entity42 striker @entity5 more for his @entity44 biting antics against @entity43 than for his supreme footballing ability already , of course , the cover - up has begun			1
@entity42 coach @entity270 began it immediately after the game			2
' this is all a conspiracy , ' he said , rather preposterously			0
' people hide behind trees looking for a story			0
' those people know who they are			0
' this , of course , is one of @entity5 ’s major problems in life			1
there are simply too many people looking to make excuses for him			0
conspiracy theories : @entity42 manager @entity270 believes people ' hide behind trees looking for a story ' i do not include @entity0 in this			1
the @entity1 manager has done all he can to educate and improve @entity5			1
@entity0 is rarely critical of his players in public but at the club ’s @entity295 training base he has not spared last season ’s player of the year			1
to call it tough love is to understate it			0
some people do n’t learn though and maybe @entity0 knows this now			2
if he does n’t then he surely will when @entity5 inevitably cites his ‘ troubles ’ as reason enough to ask out of @entity1 once more after this @entity44			1
@entity5 ’s gifts as a footballer are beyond question			1
already he has left us with two of the truly great and memorable goals of this tournament			0
the fact they both came against @entity315 does n’t really matter			0
however deep his river of talent ever runs , though , it will never fully submerge or drown his dark side			1
guidance : @entity1 boss @entity0 has done all he can to help and educate the @entity322 ' star player @entity324 machismo may prevent them complaining formally to @entity44 today			1
indeed that was the indication on monday night			0
@entity44 should proceed hastily , though			2
they have to for the good of their sport			0
as sad as it sounds , we must now place this episode in the same folder as @entity336 ’s headbutt on @entity337 in 2006 and @entity339 ’s spit at @entity340 in 1990			2
that is where it belongs			0
after 13 glorious days , this fantasy @entity44 of our dreams now has its first very real stain			2
@entity347 : @entity5 's actions rank alongside @entity336 's headbutt and @entity340 's spit red mist : @entity352 legend @entity336 headbutts @entity43 's @entity337 during the 2006 @entity44 final disgusting : @entity354 midfielder @entity339 spits at @entity27 's @entity340 during the @entity355			1

@entity5 appeared to bite @entity188 during @entity42 's 1 - 0 win over @entity43
@entity1 boss @entity0 said working with @entity5 had been a privilege last season
the striker bit @entity127 's @entity126 last year and @entity187 ’s @entity186 back in 2010
this magical @entity44 now has its first major controversy
@entity5 's immense talent will never *overshadow* his dark side
