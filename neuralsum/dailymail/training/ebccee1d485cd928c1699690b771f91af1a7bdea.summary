officer @entity8 was captured on video pulling over @entity10 and giving him a warning about driving without any headlights in @entity13 , @entity14 , earlier this month			1
but after spotting mr @entity10 's frisbee golf bag on the backseat , he started to question the driver about his passion for the game , before quickly moving on to the topic of marijuana			1
during the interrogation , he claimed all frisbee golf players smoke weed , asked mr @entity10 how much of the substance he had on him and told him he wanted to search his car			1
now , @entity40 's chief , @entity39 , has apologized for the video deeming it ' foolish ' and ' not representative of the department 's training or interactions with the public '			1

i play out at @entity54 )			0
' the officer then says : ' ok			0
i need you to answer me a question			0
why is it that everybody that plays frisbee golf smokes weed ? ' mr @entity10 quickly insists : ' no , it ’s not everybody ' however , mr @entity8 is not convinced , responding : ' it ’s everybody , man			1
you ca n’t tell me you 've never smoked weed before			0
' the motorist then says , ' i ’m not gon na tell you one way or another ' , prompting the officer to laugh and exclaim : ' see , there you go			0
how much weed do you have in the car today ? '			0
interrogation : mr @entity8 asked mr @entity10 ( pictured , left , clutching a warning letter from the officer and , right , responding to questions ) how much weed he had on him , before telling him he wanted to search his car game : video footage captures mr @entity8 asking mr @entity10 : ' why is it that everybody that plays frisbee golf smokes weed ? '			1
above , mr @entity10 had a frisbee golf bag , like this , in his car when he was pulled over although mr @entity10 denies having any marijuana , the officer responds : ' you understand you ’re free to go and everything but you would n’t have a problem with me looking through your car ? ' at this point , mr @entity10 argues : ' i actually would ' , adding : ' just because i have a disc golf bag does n’t mean that every disc golfer does have weed			1
' mr @entity8 then replies : ' so you have weed in the car then is what you ’re saying ? ' the motorist answers : ' no what i 'm saying is i would say i have a problem with you searching my car because you ’re profiling me based on being a disc golfer			2
' during the interrogation , which ends with mr @entity8 telling the motorist ' you 're free to go ' , mr @entity10 informs the officer that he is being recorded on video			1
police headquarters : @entity40 's ( pictured ) chief , @entity39 , has apologized for the video deeming it ' foolish ' and ' not representative of the department 's training or interactions with the public ' however , this does not appear to faze mr @entity8 , who replies that he is also recording audio and video footage of the traffic stop			1
in a statement via @entity122 , @entity40 said of the video : ' the officer engages the driver in a line of questioning that is foolish and not representative of the @entity129 's training or interactions with the public			2
' this verbal exchange did not meet the level of professionalism expected of @entity13 police officers			0

according to professor @entity155 , of @entity156 , mr @entity8 broke the law by trying to search a vehicle during an equipment violation stop			0
' what the officer did after that was try to extend that stop into a general search of the defendant ’s car , or the individual ’s car			0
that ’s not permissible anymore , ' he told @entity170			0
he added that even if mr @entity10 had allowed mr @entity8 to search the car and the officer had found something illegal , the evidence would likely be deemed invalid and thrown out of court			2
like regular golf , frisbee golf is a game of skill and accuracy but instead of hitting small balls , players throw a frisbee - like disc at various targets around a grassy course .			0
