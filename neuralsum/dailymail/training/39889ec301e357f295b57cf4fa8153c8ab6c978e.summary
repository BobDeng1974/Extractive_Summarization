the @entity0 has unveiled the full image sequence of @entity3 's historic descent on comet @entity4 – @entity5			1
the probe made its dramatic touchdown on 12 november while the comet was travelling at an incredible 34,000 mph ( 55,000 km per hour )			1
this series of 19 images tracks the probe 's seven hour journey as it fell 14 miles ( 22.5km ) towards the comet 's icy surface			1
when @entity3 first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			1
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			1
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
while its precise location still remains unknown , early images suggest the probe landed with two legs on the ground and one pointing into space , which is severely limiting its access to sunlight			1
since then the search has been on to identify it in higher - resolution images , but now that @entity19 has moved to a different orbit , and is further away from the comet , the chances of observing the lander are less previously , only a few frames of this image series had been made public			1
the latest images were taken from @entity19 ’s @entity18 camera with the timestamp marked in gmt while its precise location still remains unknown , early images suggest the probe landed with two legs on the ground and one pointing into space , which is severely limiting its access to sunlight			2
it is shown here during the fifth stage of its descent controllers have now said they will simply wait for @entity3 to make contact with its mothership			1
@entity19 engineers in @entity70 , @entity71 , will begin to monitor the feed in a few weeks ' time and say there could be a chance the communication will be established in may or june			0
during these months , improved lighting conditions at the probe 's assumed location could provide enough power to run the onboard radio transmitter			2
radio tests on the probe just before it lost power have narrowed down its location to somewhere in a strip of terrain roughly 350m by 30m			0
@entity19 camera 's scoured this location in early december , and each of its images were scanned by mission controllers to see if they could spot any pixels that were brighter than the rest			1
but @entity3 still could n't be found			1
if @entity3 gets its power back , it would resume all science observations , which could take place in august , just when the comet is at its most active phase , according to a report by the @entity104			1
in the meantime , the scientific haul from the comet continues as @entity19 continues its orbit around the icy body - and now illustrations have revealed amazing new details of the comet			1
an array of colours and diagrams highlight the gravitational field of the comet , thermal energy trapped between its cliffs and organic compounds on its surface			2
scientists are hoping to answer many questions about this and other comets , including its formation , structure and evolution over time			0
controllers have now said they will wait for @entity3 to make contact with its mothership			1
@entity3 is seen here on its seven - hour descent when @entity3 first made contact , a few hours after this image was taken , it failed to fire harpoons causing it to bounce twice before landing using data from the @entity141 ( @entity18 ) and the @entity143 instrument , scientists have now been able to calculate the comet ’s gravitational field			1
they have found that the gravitational force at the ‘ lobes ’ - the two ends of the comet - is about six times stronger than at the neck - the narrower area connecting the two lobes			1
it is still unknown whether the two - lobed shape of the comet is the result of two smaller bodies coming together , or if the neck has been ‘ eaten ’ away over time - like the core of an apple			2
currently the latter theory is becoming the preferred explanation , as it appears the two lobes have similar structures – indicating they have the same origin			0
from this gravitational data scientists also found that comet ’s density is about half that of water			1
dr @entity170 from the @entity171 , who was involved in the studies , told @entity174 that they now had a greater understanding of the comet 's interior			1
pictured is the current lander search area			0
now that @entity19 has moved to a different orbit , and is further away from the comet , the chances of observing the lander are less , @entity19 engineers have said the blurry image captures the rapid motion in which @entity3 was launched back out into space			1
the probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then to a much lower height of 65ft ( 20 metres ) before coming to rest @entity191 is showing signs of waking up early as it streaks towards the @entity194 at 47,800 mph ( 76,900 km / h )			1
as it approaches the sun , the rubber duck - shaped lump of ice , dust and rock is expected to heat up and release more gas and water vapour from its interior			0
comets are most active when they reach perihelion , the point in their orbit when they are closest to the @entity194 but even at a distance of more than 200 million miles ( 320 million km ) , comet @entity208 is beginning to stir in dramatic fashion			2
dr @entity211 , from the @entity212 , @entity213 , who led one of several teams reporting latest findings from the @entity0 's @entity19 in the journal @entity218 , said : ' we are already seeing more activity			0
' @entity221 are sprouting up everywhere			0
we 've been surprised to see how active it is			0
it already has more jets than many other comets do at perihelion			0
' he said the interior is now thought to be analogous to ' ash , cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow			0
' data from several instruments , meanwhile , has shown that the comet ’s neck is the source of most of the dust and gas it is ejecting			0
the reason for this is quite interesting			0
based on data , the @entity19 team found that the neck receives less energy than the rest of the comet because it is shaded			2
however , the two lobes either side trap radiation , with energy being ‘ bounced ’ between cliffs , causing the neck to be move active			0
the low gravitational pull of the neck also means that less force is needed to blow its dust and gas away than at the lobes			0
from the images and data , five basic - but diverse - categories of terrain type have been determined : dust - covered ; brittle materials with pits and circular structures ; large - scale depressions ; smooth terrains ; and more ‘ rock - like ’ surfaces			2
much of the comet also appears to be covered in dust , as a result of dust that is dragged along by the comet falling to the surface over time			2
one prominent and intriguing feature is a 1,640ft ( 500m ) long crack seen roughly parallel to the neck of the comet , running between its two larger lobes at either end			0
the biggest question remaining about the comet , though , is how it formed			0
two predominant theories remain : either it is the result of two smaller bodies ‘ sticking ’ together , forming a single comet , or its central neck has been eaten away over time like the core of an apple			0
@entity19 is essentially living with the comet as it moves towards the sun along its orbit , learning how its behaviour changes on a daily basis and , over longer timescales , how its activity increases , how its surface may evolve , and how it interacts with the solar wind , ’ said @entity302 project scientist @entity301			2
‘ we have already learned a lot in the few months we have been alongside the comet , but as more and more data are collected and analysed from this close study of the comet we hope to answer many key questions about its origin and evolution			0
’ this graphic reveals the sequence of huge bounces before the @entity3 probe came to its final , unknown resting spot in november			2

19 images track the probes seven hour journey as it fell 14 miles ( 22.5km ) towards the comet 's icy surface
a harpoon failure resulted in it bouncing twice , once to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) , before again landing
scientists still have n't found @entity3 's location despite scouring high - resolution images of the icy comet
controllers have now said they will wait for @entity3 to make contact , which may happen in may or june
