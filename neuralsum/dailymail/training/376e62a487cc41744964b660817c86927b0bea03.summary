by @entity0 @entity2 trainer @entity1 goes in search of history with one of his all - conquering power rangers in the £ 273,000 group one @entity7 but this time his speedster might struggle to call the tune with @entity10 in the field			1
in a memorable summer , @entity1 has won all four @entity7 sprints run this season with @entity15 ( @entity16 and @entity17 ) and @entity18 ( @entity19 and @entity20 )			1
another victory for @entity18 would give @entity1 a unique clean sweep in @entity25 ’s five @entity24 sprints but to achieve the feat @entity18 must do what he has never done – win over six furlongs			1
clean sweep : @entity1 is looking for his fifth group one sprint victory of the season @entity18 , the 7 - 2 favourite , is arguably in the form of his life and drying conditions play to his strengths but it can not be ignored that all 10 of the seven - year - old gelding ’s wins have come over five furlongs , all seven runs at six have ended in defeat and he finished 11th of 12 to dream ahead when running in this race in 2011			1
his jockey @entity42 , architect of a daring hold - up effort in the @entity44 , may be expressing confidence about the trip but , with that stark statistic hanging over him , @entity18 has to be opposed			1
the one to drain the @entity50 ’s power could be @entity10 ( @entity51 , 3.50 ) , who was forced to miss the @entity44 when off - colour			2
most of this colt ’s early races were over seven furlongs , including fifth in the @entity58 ’s @entity57 last year , but he has found his niche sprinting			1
win : @entity18 won at @entity19 and @entity20 , and could add a third at the @entity7 his fourth to @entity15 in the @entity16 was all the more meritorious as he raced in a disadvantaged breakaway group and jockey @entity63 had to make a move sooner than he probably wanted			1
in contrast , his latest win in @entity67 ’s @entity66 saw @entity10 eat up the ground in the final furlong after being asked a big hold - up question			0
his trainer @entity72 may have made his name with middle distance stars like @entity75 and @entity76 but , in more recent times , sprinters like @entity79 and @entity80 , winner of this race in 2010 , have defined his career			2
@entity84 said : ‘ it ’s maturity , a change of tactics and the trainer finally getting the right trip with @entity10			2
‘ he has been an absolute revelation this year			0
he looks nothing like a sprinter but it is amazing how he covers the ground			0
double : @entity15 , also trained by lynam , won the @entity16 and @entity17 ‘ he did n’t give me any reason to think seven furlongs was n’t right and then went to @entity102 last year and was drawn on the outside in a huge handicap			1
‘ @entity63 had to use up a lot of horse to get into the right position			0
two furlongs out , he looked like winning 10 lengths and then fell in a heap			0
‘ we messed about with cross nosebands and tongue ties but the answer was he was just getting faster as he was getting older			0
‘ if there similarities between this horse and @entity80 it is that they are both big horses and , therefore , rather by definition , likely to improve with time			2
’ other potential improvers in the line - up are @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , all strong finishers in the @entity44 , the latter being particularly unlucky			0
while the standard is set by last year ’s winner , and 2012 runner - up , @entity129 .			0

@entity2 trainer @entity1 *targeting* clean sweep in @entity7 sprints
his horses @entity18 and @entity15 have won all four races so far
@entity18 won @entity19 and @entity20
@entity15 won @entity16 and @entity17
if @entity18 wins @entity139 will have won all five
main *competitor* will be music master
