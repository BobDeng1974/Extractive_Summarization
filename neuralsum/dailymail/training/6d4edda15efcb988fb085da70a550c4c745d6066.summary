by @entity0 moaning with culinary pleasure as they give a running commentary on their meals , these are the ' dinner porn ' stars of @entity8 - who live - stream themselves gorging on food for money			2
the bizarre craze is called mok - bang , a mash - up of the words ' dinner ' and ' broadcast ' , and can earn serious money for the biggest eaters			1
one , ' beautiful glutton ' @entity19 , makes thousands of pounds from her daily work as an internet star - which she balances with a day job with a consulting firm			1
her plates of choice range from two medium pizzas to 30 fried eggs and a box of crab legs , or five packets of instant noodles			1
she spends almost £ 2,000 a month on food and has put on one and a half stone since winning her fame - but reportedly makes thousands of pounds a month from her broadcasts			1
some professional eaters make 30 times the average salary by getting ' @entity69 ' from their fans for a good show , @entity66 told the @entity8 website @entity72			1
the balloons are then traded into @entity74 which can be spent in the real world			0
the diva insisted she did not have an eating disorder , was not regurgitating her meals and had no health problems			0
dinner : @entity8 has a whole network of ' broadcast jockeys ' who eat live in front of their fans participants are rewarded not just for their quantity of food , but the way they engage with their audience she added she began broadcasting her dinners because she was ' bored and needed a hobby '			2
the diva is just one of a host of people who have started broadcasting themselves eating over-the - top meals			0
another , @entity100 , devours plates of food the size of her head while answering questions from her fans , including how much she can eat and how often she uses the toilet , all live on air			0
the videos have now swept onto @entity110 , where they have several thousands views - more than 200,000 in one case			0
people have been mystified as to what has caused the craze for over-eating , which jars with the poverty and hunger of people living just a few hundred miles north in totalitarian @entity121			0
their best guess is that it helps make eating alone a little less miserable - even if the only people the live - eaters have for company is thousands of fans on the web			1
using their noodle : the livestream eaters have turned their gluttony into a profitable business food porn : some of the participants remain remarkably slender , considering the vast amounts they eat on air i ca n't take any more : with daily shows , it 's no surprise this live - eater struggled with his mountain of food			2
