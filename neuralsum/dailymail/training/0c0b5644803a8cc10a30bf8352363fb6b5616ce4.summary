prowling through the fields the fearsome feline patrols his hunting ground , pausing only occasionally to preen his luxuriant ginger mane			2
but hopefully this time domestic cat @entity6 , who has been blamed for inadvertently triggering @entity9 ’s biggest safari hunt in living memory by being mistaken for a lion , will be allowed to saunter off in peace			1
the three - year - old pet – a @entity14 which can weigh up to 25lb , be up to 16in tall and 40in long – was seen stalking around his home in @entity16 , @entity17 today after the panic from sunday night			1
but the only thing he seemed to have on his mind was peering through a hole in the fence and lazily walking across a lawn			2
@entity6 : the lion on the loose turned out to be domestic cat @entity6 @entity26 or tabby cat : images similar to this one were handed to @entity17 police , sparking the large - scale search involving helicopters last night i 've got my eye on you : @entity6 the @entity14 cat casts a threatening glance as he peeks through a fence the hunt is on ! @entity6 saunters across a garden - perhaps to pounce on something he spotted and no one could blame him for slinking about after his brush with the limelight over the @entity45 weekend			1
@entity6 lives just a few hundred yards from where holidaymakers spotted a big cat at a caravan park near @entity16 in @entity17 on sunday			1
following reports of a wild animal on the loose , armed officers and two police helicopters using heat - seeking equipment , which cost £ 880 an hour to run , were scrambled			1
workers from nearby @entity57 carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the fields and residents were warned to stay indoors			0
caravanners were temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre			0
but while the local community was plunged into terror , @entity6 ’s owner @entity63 watched the drama unfold on television from @entity68 , where she was away			1
and she immediately had her suspicions			0
' big as two sheep ' : @entity71 ( left ) and @entity72 claim they saw the lion outside their caravan near @entity16 , @entity17 ' witnesses ' : ( from left ) @entity78 , from @entity79 , and husband and wife @entity80 and @entity83 say they saw a big cat during their @entity45 trip to @entity86 in @entity87 , near @entity16 , @entity17 searching : police were seen patrolling areas around @entity86 in @entity87 ( pictured ) , near @entity16 , @entity17 ready to shoot : an armed police officer patrols near the caravan site in @entity16 last night ‘ it clicked right away , ’ she said			1
‘ we thought it had to be @entity96 as he ’s the only big gingery thing around there and he does tend to wander into that field			1
’ after looking at the pictures of the supposed lion mrs @entity63 said she had no doubt it was @entity96			2
‘ there ’s no question about , it ’s him			0
as we were away he probably went into the field to sulk			0
‘ from a distance , because he has a light - coloured mane he does look a little lion like			2
i can see why someone would think that			0
‘ he ’s a @entity14 , which is the biggest breed of domestic cat			1
and he ’s got the personality to match , he has such a bad attitude and puts the dog in his place all the time			0
‘ he thinks he ’s the man of the house and has often been mistaken for a fox			2
’ despite mrs @entity63 ’s certainty as to the culprit in @entity125 , however , there remain several witnesses who remain equally convinced that the creature they saw was much more than just a little kitty			1
first to spot the animal was @entity130 , 52 , a warehouse worker from @entity79 , on holiday at @entity86 with her husband @entity132			1
‘ there was some smoke from a bonfire , but it cleared i could see this shape in the field , so i got the binoculars out , ’ she said yesterday			0
‘ i said to my husband , “ what do you make of that ? ” he said , “ that ’s a lion			2
” we were n’t scared at all – it was excitement			0
‘ you do n’t often see something like that in the wild			0
at one point time it sat up and looked at us and we could see its ears twitching			0
it knew we were there and it sat down and started cleaning itself			0
’ beware : village green at @entity87 ( pictured ) near to where the beast was believed to have been spotted			0
police have now called off the search of the area people passing this photo of a lion around social networking site @entity167 thought this was the lion that sparked the hunt			1
police have confirmed it is a fake mr @entity78 , a driver , telephoned police			2
they initially thought it was a hoax and asked to speak to others at the site			0
so he duly knocked on the door of @entity71 and @entity72 ’s caravan as they were settling down to have their supper around 7pm			0
the @entity26 sightings : the big cat was seen in fields near @entity16 ( file photo ) mr @entity185 , 52 , a building maintenance inspector from @entity187 , @entity188 , said : ‘ i went out and had a look through the binoculars			1
i saw what i ’m sure was a very big cat			1
i thought , “ @entity193 – that ’s a lion			2
” it was big , about the length of two sheep			2
‘ it was 200 yards away but i was n’t worried as we were nearer to the safety of our caravan than it was to us			0
' the farmer turned up before the police got there and walked towards it , unarmed , and it ran off			2
’ after speaking to mr @entity185 on mr @entity78 ’s mobile , the police roared into action			2
‘ they were very sceptical at first , quite understandably , ’ mr @entity78 said			0
‘ when they did turn up but they missed it by three minutes			1
’ the hunt certainly injected an unexpected dose of excitement into the community of @entity87 , which until sunday had held little intrigue for most except weathermen and caravan enthusiasts			0
officially the driest place in the country ( with just 20.2in of rainfall last year , compared with the national average of 45.9in ) , its other claim to fame is the neighbouring settlement of @entity228 – @entity17 ’s largest concentration of static caravan parks			1
but for 20 hours , the village – five miles west of @entity16 on the @entity232 – became the scene of the dramatic big - game mystery			2
as news of the alleged predator in their midst filtered down , what followed was a mixture of unease and disbelief as villagers grappled with the questions on everyone ’s mind about the unusual sighting : had it escaped from a zoo , circus or private owner ? was it born free or something tamer ? the search teams failed to find evidence of a lion – no fur , no droppings , one unconfirmed sighting of a paw print – and the police warning was soon downgraded to be ‘ a bit wary ’ if walking in the country			1
police hunt : armed police are hunting a lion which was spotted in fields near a caravan site in @entity87 , @entity17 ( pictured ) on the loose : the lion was spotted in the village of @entity87 , near @entity16 , @entity17 whatever it was , it had not escaped from @entity57 , as all its animals had been accounted for			1
and a circus that had recently been in town told officers it was not one lion short of a full big top either			1
as the day wore on , the mystery deepened as photographs of the by now world famous ‘ @entity17 lion ’ began emerging and , as so often in the modern age , were circulated via social networking sites			1
some were downright fakes , others simply seemed to make the situation even more woolly			0
one , supposedly taken of it at night by a car , was soon dismissed as a fake			0
another , taken by @entity185 on her digital camera , looked to the untrained eye rather like a sheep although she was genuinely believes it was ‘ a big cat with pointy ears and a white ruff ’			1
@entity167 , meanwhile , was awash with parodies , fake pictures and jokes			0
more than one gag dwelled on the fact that a luxurious mane and a permanent tan meant this ‘ lion ’ would blend in well with the @entity17 natives			1
by last night most of @entity87 ’s 4,119 residents were sleeping a little easier , safe in the knowledge that a rumble with a ‘ @entity312 ’ remains unlikely in their quiet neck of the woods			0
beast : the creature , thought to be a panther , was spotted in the early hours of this morning ( file photo ) a panther has been spotted on the loose in the @entity321 today			2
@entity322 , 30 , said he was convinced he saw a big cat in his headlights as he made his way home across @entity327 in the early hours of this morning			1
he nearly collided with the animal by the side of the road , swerved , and saw it pounce into the bushes and disappear			0
mr @entity322 , who contacted a big cat expert after the sighting , believed it was the same creature which shocked residents in fields at @entity338 , near @entity339 , in april			1
he said : ‘ it looked at me from the side of the road			0
i was coming round quite a sharp bend from @entity338 up the hill to @entity327 and it was on the left hand side of the road in my main beam – i nearly hit it			0
‘ it was the size of a large dog , about 2.5ft high and about 4ft long with a @entity353 tail curled upwards			0
‘ i swerved to the right to make sure i did n’t hit it and it pounced into the bushes			0
‘ i ’m now 100 per cent sure it was a big black cat , with no markings on			1
’ scary ! @entity362 superimposed onto a picture of a lion to look like he is frightened and running away from the beast is this the lion ? many @entity167 users claimed @entity369 star @entity368 , pictured wearing fitting make - up , was actually the lion on the loose as hundreds of users posted their own version of the predator on the site ' i saw the @entity17 lion ' , claimed one @entity167 user who uploaded this picture on the site today too cute for a lion surely ? the owner did n't think so as she posted this picture on @entity167			1

picture of ' lion ' could be @entity14 cat @entity6 , who today went for a walk around @entity17
30 police officers , *marksmen* and two helicopters were involved in search
no sign of predator but witnesses stand by claims that they saw a big cat
@entity6 *'s* owner convinced he must have been mistaken for the lion as he ' is the only big gingery thing around here '
@entity132 and wife @entity130 said police missed the lion by three minutes
