by @entity1 reporter a massive 400 - foot deep sinkhole that has opened up in a @entity4 bayou has swallowed all of the 100 - foot trees in the surrounding area and led to mandatory evacuations			1
about 150 people have been ordered to leave their residences after the 400 - sqaure - foot gaping hole opened in @entity12 amid fears of potential radiation leaks and natural gas explosions			1
but despite the authorities enacting the mandatory evacuation , most people have decided to stay following allegations of a cover - up and industrial mis - management from the owners of a nearby salt cavern			0
diesel sheen is seen on the water in an aerial view of the sinkhole			2
state officials said on that small amounts of diesel hydrocarbons were found in swamp water where an acre of swampland liquefied over the last week as state scientists monitored the toxicity of naturally occurring radiation at a slurry hole in @entity12 , residents said thursday they were furious with their public state officials because they think they have been withholding information			1
the @entity41 said the slurry hole near @entity43 is near areas that have been used for oil and gas exploration			2
low levels of radioactivity may be remaining from the work , though not at harmful levels , officials say			1
' out of abundance of caution and because of the ongoing incident , i have decided to further enhance our monitoring efforts , ' @entity52 secretary @entity51 said in a statement			0
officials said the first set of 15 samples from the area show that there are no detectable levels of naturally occurring radioactive material on the surface of the sinkhole and @entity69 says they 're confident residents are n't at risk for exposure			1
bubbles come to the surface where pipelines come across @entity43 and a pipeline sign is seen on the right @entity41 spokesman @entity79 said such material tends to accumulate in low levels on equipment used to drill for oil and gas			1
gas bubbles have been erupting in the area for weeks			1
residents have been especially alarmed at the possibility of a natural gas explosion after 28 residents in @entity91 had to evacuate their homes on christmas 2003 because natural gas was seeping from a salt dome storage cavern and bubbling up into water wells			1
residents have also been reporting earthquakes but despite a battery of tests conducted by federal , parish and local officials , no one has been able to figure out the source of the tremors			1
@entity105 , who lives in @entity91 and owns a body shop in @entity107 , said he 's noticed tremors for years			1
he eventually moved out of his house because he did n't feel safe and has been unable to sell it because the property value plummeted after several small sinkholes opened up in his yard			1
the massive sinkhole has caused the governor to order the evacuation of 150 residents from the parish scientists said at a community meeting tuesday the sinkhole might be related to a brine cavern owned by @entity124 - based @entity123 contained within an underground salt dome			1
it has been reported that local officials at @entity123 have known since at least january 2011 that there have been problems with the structural integrity of a brine cavern that was plugged in june 2010			2
officials did not mention those issues at the meeting			2
' it 's what i 've been saying all along , that they 've been hiding things , ' @entity105 said			0
' i think our local officials are trying to do the best they can , but i think they 're being hindered by the higher - ups hiding things			2
' @entity105 said he was especially worried after a parish official had him fill out a form asking him to list his next of kin thursday morning			0
' that 's a little disturbing to me			0
they said it 's in case they ca n't reach us to evacuate			0
but i mean , come on			0
they can reach everyone , ' he said			0
rep. @entity156 , @entity157 , said he wants more transparency and answers from the @entity160			2
he said he had no idea about structural issues within the brine cavern until he read about them in the paper			0
before : the sinkhole was much smaller last thursday , pictured ' there is a serious lack of competence now in the state , and we knew nothing			2
why did they close the mine ? we did n't get any answers			0
it 's a real lack of competence now , ' @entity156 said			0
@entity179 , spokesman for @entity123 , said they 're continuing to monitor the area for any changes			0
' we 've installed booms around the perimeter of the sinkhole to contain any floating contaminants , the diesel , anything else , ' @entity179 said			0
dr. @entity189 , director of the state @entity192 ' oil and gas division , said the sinkhole could have been caused by structural problems within the salt dome that sits underneath it			1
the wall of salt between the brine cavern and the salt dome might be thinner than experts were led to believe , he said			0
he said this sinkhole was unusual because it sits on the edge of the dome , when sinkholes normally sit right on top			0
some residents in the area said that they had been experiencing tremors for years before the enormous sinkhole opened up officials said the sinkhole , which has swallowed up and liquefied a 372 - foot wide circle of swampland , has not grown in size since saturday			1
the owners of four natural gas pipelines nearby were asked to depressurize and vent off their pipelines as a precaution after the slurry area bent a 400 - foot - long section of pipeline			2
governor @entity222 declared a state of emergency friday in @entity12 and ordered an immediate evacuation of 150 homes and several businesses			1
the evacuation remains in effect			0
officials said on friday it will be at least 40 days before they get definitive answers about an enormous sinkhole that opened up in @entity12			1
@entity233 , president of @entity234 , a subsidiary of @entity235 , said the company spent the last week ' intensely focused ' on an emergency response as they try to figure out the cause behind a sinkhole near @entity43			0
low levels of radioactivity may be emanating , though not at harmful levels , officials said @entity233 said they 'll be drilling a relief well to investigate a brine cavern they own , which is housed within the @entity157 salt dome			1
it will take at least 40 days to drill the well , and scientists have speculated that the 372 - foot - wide and 422 - foot - deep sinkhole might be related to structural problems within the cavern , he said			1
' our efforts are going to be more focused on diagnostics , and looking into what caused this event , ' @entity233 said at a press conference in @entity260			0
commissioner of conservation @entity261 ordered the company thursday to drill a well and investigate the salt cavern and ' further evaluate potential causes of the subsidence near its well site , ' as well as obtain samples of cavern content			0
@entity233 said the company was just as shocked as anyone else when the sinkhole erupted last friday , swallowing up an acre of bald cypress trees and leaving diesel fumes and slurry water in its wake .			2

fears that low levels of radiation are being *emitted* from the sinkhole and residents are being asked to leave
gas bubbles have been bubbling in the @entity4 bayou for weeks and residents have felt small tremors for years
officials said on friday it will be at least 40 days before they get definitive answers about an enormous sinkhole that opened up in @entity12
some residents have *refused* to leave their homes
