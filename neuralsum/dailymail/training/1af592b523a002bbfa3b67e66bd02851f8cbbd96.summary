by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity3 reporter the @entity5 's first ever female union leader has given an ominous warning to any critics who may doubt her leadership skills based on her gender			1
while introducing herself to over 100 @entity5 players at a private meeting in @entity14 last month , @entity10 used the opportunity make an impression on the athletes			1
and it was a strong one			0
' my past , ' she told the roomful of men whose million - dollar contracts she would soon represent , ' is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think i was someone they could sleep on			2
' formidable : @entity10 issued an ominous warning to anyone who may underestimate her abilities as the first female leader of a major @entity34 sports union the startling statement came after the high - power @entity37 attorney rattled off her considerable resume -- @entity39 , partner at a prestigious firm -- but still sensed the gender question at the tip of everyone in the private meeting 's tongues			1
' i bet you can tell i 'm a woman , ' she said cooly , ' and i suspect the rest of the world can , too			0
' soon after , she won 32 of 34 votes to clench her new position , reports the @entity54			0
it capped a long and arduous process to replace @entity57 , who was ousted in february 2013			0
@entity10 was one of the finalists initially offered to the rank - and - file during all - star weekend in february , but the process was re-opened under another search committee at the urging of some players and agents			1
more than 100 players reconvened in @entity14 that week , and after some tense moments leading up to the vote , @entity10 emerged as the winner			1
' obviously , i would 've preferred that it happen sooner rather than later , but i completely understood when there were questions raised about the process , ' @entity10 said			1
' frankly , i would not have wanted them to ignore those questions and not affirmatively address those concerns			0
i wanted the job in february , but i wanted the job where there would be no questions about the fairness or the process , so i completely endorsed the executive committee to address these questions , and they did and now best i can tell they 're very pleased			0
' foe : new nba commissioner @entity88 may be re-examining his expectations of after @entity10 described her past as ' littered with the bones of men ' who 've underestimated her			1
he 'll be one of her opponents at union negotiations the players considered more than 300 candidates during their 17 - month search before picking @entity10 , who has been called the finest trial lawyer in @entity37 by ' @entity100			1
' she said her new job will feature straight , honest talk , just like she delivers to a jury , and the strategizing that made her such a successful lawyer			0
the search to replace @entity57 , who led the @entity107 from 1996 until a review of the union was critical of his business practices , leaves players with less than two years to prepare for the next potential collective bargaining talks			2
either the union or the league can opt out of the current agreement in 2017			2
the union has struggled for years with in - fighting and a lack of organization , and the players took a significant cut in their guarantee of basketball - related income — 57 percent to about 50 percent , a drop of hundreds of millions annually in salary costs — in the contentious lockout in 2011			1
league revenues are on the rise , a new tv contract is set to be negotiated in 2016 and franchise valuations are skyrocketing			0
' as far as i 'm concerned , preparations for @entity132 negotiations started yesterday , ' @entity10 said			2
' it 's at the top of my list of things that i 've been instructed to begin the process of preparing for , and sure it 's a lot to do , but i 've never been shy about hard work and long hours , so we 'll get it done			2
' @entity5 commissioner @entity88 congratulated @entity10 in a statement , saying he looked forward to working with her ' to ensure the continued health and growth of our game			1
' ' the partnership between our players and teams is the backbone of the league , and we are eager to continue working with the @entity154 to build this relationship , ' @entity88 said			0
the fallout from the lockout and the @entity57 ouster left the union reeling			0
but it also made @entity10 want to get involved , which will bring the @entity163 native back home			2
' the more i thought about it , ' she said , ' the more i thought that would be a great opportunity to do something really important			0
