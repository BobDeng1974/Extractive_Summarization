private sector takes slack of public sector cuts rubbishes @entity3 claims that job creation was ' complete fantasy ' by @entity6 published : 19:24 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 19:25 est , 12 june 2013 more than 1.2million jobs have been created in the private sector under the @entity9			1
while the number of state workers has dropped by 614,000 since may 2010 , the number in the private sector has jumped by 1.25million to a record 24.1million , the @entity10 revealed			1
it makes a mockery of the claim by shadow chancellor @entity3 in october 2011 that it was ‘ a complete fantasy ’ the private sector could mop up the jobs culled in the public sector			1
at current rates , two private - sector jobs are being created for every one lost in the public sector			1
employment minister @entity25 said : ‘ it is a credit to the growth of @entity29 businesses up and down the country that we now have a record number of people employed in the private sector			2
’ the government was ‘ not complacent ’ about a jobs market whose strength had consistently surprised economists as @entity29 ’s weak economic recovery dragged on , he said			0
despite a double - dip recession followed by a painfully slow recovery , their predictions that unemployment would rocket , possibly hitting three million , have been wide of the mark			0
@entity49 chairman @entity48 also praised the sharp rise in private - sector employment – up 46,000 between january and march while the public sector dropped by 22,000 – as ‘ a credit to @entity29 businesses ’			1
‘ our priority now is to carry on getting more people into work , and to help everyone who wants to work hard and get on in life , ’ he said			0

the @entity10 said the average worker was getting a pay rise , if bonuses are excluded , of 0.9 per cent – far below inflation , currently 2.4 per cent			0
@entity96 , a director of the website @entity98 , said : ‘ businesses who have been treading water during the last three to four years of stagnant gdp figures can no longer afford to put off hiring and must capitalise on these signs of economic growth			0
’ the number of private sector jobs has risen sharply since a low of 22.5million after the 2008 financial crash spending cuts and a renewed focus on creating private sector jobs has seen the number of people working for the state tumble from 6.3million to 5.7million			1
