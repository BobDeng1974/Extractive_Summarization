she said : ' i 'm going through a phase right now where i do n't fit my boobs anymore - i 'm thinking about a reduction because that was a phase and now i am out of it			0
' after my daughter was born , when i was breastfeeding it became hard not to look at my boobs now and see them as milk and fat			0
' the person i feel like today is n't a person with big boobs - i feel like i 'm trapped in this body right now			1
' @entity1 with her son @entity137 ( left ) , husband @entity136 and daughter @entity135 but while she may be having second thoughts about her chest , the star reveals she has never been happier with her figure since becoming a mother			1
she said : ' before having my kids i was a free spirit			0
i had no filters and i could run around naked and feel free as i felt like i had no flaws			0
' but then again , there were only certain jeans i could fit into because i was a size zero ( @entity151 size 4 ) , while at the @entity112 - i had no butt and no hips			0
' after two kids , i have hips , a butt and curves			0
' i actually love my body even more now because i remember being that thin and wishing i could fit into high - waisted jeans and sophisticated dresses but they just looked frumpy on me			1
' while @entity1 was in the @entity112 , she was a tiny size zero ( @entity151 size 4 ) according to @entity1 , her husband @entity137 , who she married at the @entity112 in june 2009 is equally impressed by his wife 's new curves			1
she said : ' i think he sees my confidence over everything and that 's what he loves the most			0
' he loves my body , i have some wear and tear right now with my stomach but he talks to me about it all of the time			1
' he says if we do n't have sex one day it feels like a beautiful @entity176 that 's in the garage that he ca n't drive every day			2
' but while she is now more confident than ever with her body , @entity1 did n't feel this way until recently			1
during her first pregnancy with @entity137 , the star admits that she piled on the weight because she took the phrase ' eating for two ' literally , like many women			1
she said : ' because i was so skinny beforehand , i just ate and ate , then did no exercise			0
' i put on 65lbs in my first pregnancy and it took me so long to get rid of it			0
' i tried for about a year and nothing was working			0
' @entity1 and @entity136 at the ' @entity191 : @entity193 ' film premiere in @entity27 last week kendra with her children last autumn what made it worse was that , like many women , @entity1 started to compare her progress with celebrities in magazines			1
she said : ' @entity202 was pregnant with her first child at the same time that i was pregnant with mine - we gave birth about two days apart			0
' the afterwards , her weight just dropped off			2
' i saw a picture of her looking all tiny and i just burst into tears			0
' i was thinking to myself , " i 'm going to the gym twice a day , i 'm getting these special meals delivered to my house , why ca n't i look like that ? " ' we do this to ourselves as women , but we should n't - it takes some a lot longer than others to lose the weight			2
' before she became pregnant a second time , with her daughter @entity222 , who was born last may , @entity1 was diagnosed with hypothyroidism			1
after meeting with an endocrinologist , she overhauled her lifestyle , focusing on exercise and healthy eating			0
@entity1 pregnant with her daughter while out and about with her son last april in @entity27 she said : ' in my second pregnancy , i was so much more active and ate really healthy food - my cravings the second time around were oranges and mangoes			1
' it made such a huge difference , because even though i put on about 55lbs , which is around 10lbs less than last time , i knew that it was good fat that was coming from a healthy place			0
' then straight after i gave birth , about 20lbs just melted away			0
i was walking around the neighbourhood just three days later and i felt great , even though i 'd just had a c - section			0
' i still had another 20lbs or so to lose , but i did n't rush myself and it came off a lot easier than the last time			0
' although when i went in the jungle for i 'm a celebrity , that was brilliant , the last bit just came straight off ! ' this point she is keen to stress - that she gave herself time to lose the weight			2
@entity1 poses at the " @entity252 " dvd signing in @entity27 in 2006 @entity1 being evicted from i 'm a celebrity last december like most other women , she too looks at some of the celebrities who show off six - packs just a few weeks after giving birth and is flabbergasted			1
she said : ' that 's the time that your body should be recovering , when you should be spending time with your baby and letting yourself heal			2
' it 's such a taboo			0
' you can see how it happens though , because the camera adds weight , so people who are on tv think that they need to lose weight so they will look slimmer on camera			2
' then they end up looking to skinny in photos			0
' but i have to be realistic with myself			0
' for me , i take my own selfies and see how i look through that , because i try not to go off the scale , just by how the way i fit in clothes and the way i look in selfies			0
