a teenage girl was savagely attacked by her own @entity1 after the puppy ‘ suddenly flipped ' , tearing off part of her face			1
@entity6 from @entity7 , needed two hours of facial reconstruction surgery and more than 50 stitches after the mauling , which tore a chunk out of her nose			2
and the 13 - year - old , who had raised @entity15 since he was nine days old , is still mystified why her 13 - month - old pet suddenly attacked her			1
attacked : @entity6 , 13 , needed more than 50 stitches after was mauled by her pet @entity15 , who she had raised from a puppy remarkably plastic surgeons managed to piece together @entity23 's face and today the teenager has barely a scratch to remind of her of the terrifying attack			1
but her mother @entity27 , 39 , said she was still struggling to sleep after witnessing the ferocious incident			2
' it was horrific , ' said the former ambulance worker			2
' @entity23 just bent down to give him his plate of food and he just went for her			2
' he just flipped , even afterwards when we put him in a cage he growled and barked angrily every time one of us went near him , something had changed in his mind			1
recovery : @entity6 spent three days in hospital after the attack , the 13 - year - old is now wary of stranger 's dogs ' when he got off @entity23 there was so much blood in @entity23 ’s eyes that she could n’t see a thing and we were sure the dog had got her eyes			1
' luckily her father , @entity55 , an army trainee nurse who previously served 18 - and - a - half years as a tank commander , was in the living room and heard the dog growl and @entity23 scream during the attack			1
' i rushed into the kitchen and saw @entity23 holding her face and screaming as blood poured out , ' said mr @entity55			2
' i grabbed the first thing i could find to dress the wounds and stem the bleeding which , as it happens , was socks from the washing basket			2
' my wife called 999 and shut the dog outside whilst i just went into triage mode to treat my daughter			0
' and the family say they have no idea why @entity15 , who was later put down , suddenly changed			1
mrs @entity6 said they also adopted his brother , @entity78 , who has never behaved aggressively			0
she said : ' the attack was so vicious , it even traumatised @entity78			0
he cowered in the corner and would n’t come out for days			1
' we ’ve had them since they were nine days old , you just do not expect that to happen from a friendly dog			1
' @entity23 spent three days in hospital recovering from the attack			1
she said : ' i do n’t remember much which is probably a good thing			0
i remember @entity92 telling me to sit up so that he could see my face and then the next thing i can recall is being in the back of the ambulance and looking out of the window			0
' i do n’t even remember having a cannula in the back of my hand , and i hate needles			0
' today : @entity6 has made a full recovery and is still close to @entity15 's brother @entity78 @entity104 , a @entity105 from @entity106 , said : ' we were told by control that it was an animal bite and , to me , it was one of those jobs that could ’ve been nothing			1
' when we walked into the house there was too much calm and it was very quiet			0
as we made our way into the kitchen we found a very calm but shocked @entity23 with bandages on her face , a lot of blood everywhere			0
' ' she ’s an extraordinary young girl , ' added mrs @entity6			0
' when she came back from the hospital the first thing she did was go up to the window to go and see our other dog			0
' she ’s not so sure about other people ’s dogs but she ’s not scared , i think the whole thing fazed me more than her			0
' the plastic surgeon has done a brilliant job , you can barely see a scar on here which is amazing considering massive bite she had on her face			0
