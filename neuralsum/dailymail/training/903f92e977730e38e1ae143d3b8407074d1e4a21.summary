by @entity0 it takes hours of practice and years of experience to become a piano virtuoso or a concert violinist			0
but a new app that works alongside a small usb device lets people create music using hand gestures while they sit in front of their computer			1
users can move their hands and fingers in mid-air , which the clever little device beneath translates into motion and then a variety of sounds that can be layered up to make tunes			0
hands on : a new app that works alongside a small usb device called the @entity25 ( pictured ) lets people create music using hand gestures while they sit in front of their computer the innovation is described by the app ’s creators as ‘ a new expressive musical instrument ’			1
@entity34 based computer sensor manufacturer , @entity35 , has turned its attention to electronic music by enabling its hands - free controller to work alongside the @entity41 desktop app called @entity42			2
the app is the result of a collaboration between a musician called @entity47 who composes tunes for films and video games and dr @entity51 of the @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54			1
people can use the @entity25 , which costs € 89 ( £ 74 ; $ 79 ) to make their own ambient music			2
the technology , which is slightly larger than a cigarette lighter , tracks the points of fingers using three infrared leds and two image sensors to follow movement around 200 times more precisely than @entity67 ’s original @entity66 sensor			0
infinite possibilities : the @entity42 app , which costs $ 9.99 ( £ 6 ) enables people to create layers of chords , drums and ' atmospheric sounds ' using a strange interface of shapes ( pictured ) to come up with electronic compositions			1
it uses the @entity25 so people can compose by waving their hands in mid air it can read broad and subtle hand gestures and allows people to control ‘ normal ’ software using pinch gestures to zoom and swiping motions to navigate websites , for example			1
the hardware works alongside a conventional mouse and keyboard , which allows would - be - musicians to interact more normally with the computer programme			0
the @entity42 app , which costs $ 9.99 ( £ 6 ) enables people to create layers of chords , drums and ‘ atmospheric sounds ’ using a strange interface of cubes , @entity93 explained			1
by hovering a finger over the cubes they are selected and a simple hand gesture of opening the fingers plays them			0
the app ’s creators said this gives people an ‘ infinite sound palette ’ from which to combine sounds			2
no more boring instruments : the app is a result of a collaboration between musician @entity47 and dr @entity51 of the @entity52 to free people from traditional instruments			1
here a screen shows a more conventional view for musicians who want to compose tunes using traditional notes swiping side to side accesses extra chord sets and drums , while an ‘ @entity123 ’ function means people can listen to – or play long with – music being automatically composed by the software			0
echo and reverberation of the sound can be controlled by moving hands in a certain way towards the computer screen , making the virtual instrument much more intuitive to learn than a traditional instrument			0
@entity47 and dr @entity51 came up with the idea for the app after seeing the @entity25			1
‘ the idea was to get people away from their instruments so we made a way for people to interface with tones where you ’re unbound from your instruments , ’ dr @entity51 said			2
the app is available from @entity147 ’s airspace store for @entity149 or later versions .			0
