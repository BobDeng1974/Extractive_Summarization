when they first set eyes on the rundown old farmhouse and derelict outbuildings , all @entity1 and @entity0 wanted to know from a local surveyor was : will the property fall down before we buy it ? most people would have baulked at taking on four - and - a - half acres of untamed land , a silted - up pond and crumbling @entity13 listed house , but the @entity15 were certain the property ‘ had our name on it ’			1
and for the next 38 years , they spent every weekend painstakingly restoring @entity20 , near @entity21 in @entity22 , and creating the most beautiful gardens			1
hard work : @entity1 , 76 , and @entity0 , 74 , bought derelict @entity25 near @entity21 in @entity22 , in 1976 , and after doing it up , are now selling it at the beginning of each year , @entity1 would make charts detailing what they would work on , from laying reclaimed floor tiles to building garden walls			1
the couple cheerfully admit that @entity25 was not so much a project as an obsession			1
it became their life ’s work			0
‘ i can honestly say i never resented a single day of it , ’ says @entity1 , now 76			1
‘ we were both working in @entity41 and we had two children – our son was ten and our daughter was 13 when we moved in – so to be here at weekends in this beautiful setting was all we wanted			0
i ’d do it all again			0
’ @entity1 did nearly all the work himself , and each brick and stone was recycled or salvaged to ensure authenticity			1
the result is a beautifully renovated period home that has received a commendation from @entity54			0
before buying @entity25 , the @entity15 lived in a 1970s - built house – which they hated – in nearby @entity57			1
they had previously renovated a @entity60 property in @entity61 , but other than that they had no professional training			0
they are , however , both art college graduates and very creative : @entity0 was head of the @entity66 , while @entity1 had his own graphic design company			1
green project : @entity1 has done nearly all the work himself , and each brick and stone has been recycled or salvaged to ensure authenticity they bought @entity25 for £ 34,000 , having sold their five - bedroom ‘ executive home ’ for £ 32,000			1
‘ we did n’t have a lot of money to fund the work , ’ recalls @entity1			1
‘ when we had money , we did what needed to be paid for			0
when we did n’t , i worked on whatever i could that did n’t cost anything except my labour			0
’ he says he did everything apart from ‘ electrics and serious plastering ’			0
‘ if i did n’t know how to do something , i learnt it so that i could do it properly , ’ he adds			0
the @entity15 had no idea the house had medieval origins until an antiques dealer who came to deliver a table recognised its age from the beamed dining - room ceiling			1
it turned out the room dated from the 15th century , and records showed there were buildings on the site as far back as 1279			0
the dining room is the oldest part of the house , dominated by a large inglenook fireplace with a bread oven on one side			2
the sitting room next door is part of a 16th century extension , with an even bigger fireplace containing a substantial groove where the residents would sharpen their kitchen knives			0
there ’s also a sunny second sitting room , part of a @entity118 extension , as well as a long kitchen and a breakfast room			0
an ancient wooden staircase leads up to the first floor , where what was once the biggest bedroom has been dubbed ‘ the repository ’ by the @entity15 , as it ’s now stuffed with antique furniture and tapestries			2
yet another inglenook in this room was discovered only during the couple ’s renovations			2
two bedrooms , two bathrooms and a dressing room , all with their own quirky charm , complete this floor , while under the eaves of the top floor are two more large bedrooms as well as a study			0
making a profit : the six - bedroom house is now on the market for £ 1.995million while @entity1 was busy carrying out the heavy labour , @entity0 was focusing on the interior , finding exactly the right furniture for each room			1
‘ collecting antique furniture became another obsession , ’ she says			0
‘ we got to know some of the dealers – they would ring us up if they had a piece they thought we ’d like			0
’ the gardens were as much a labour of love as the house			2
what was once brambles and rubble is now a magical series of connecting courtyards , green lawns , lush borders and a wonderful walled garden			0
the once - silted pond now has an elegant curved bridge across the narrowest part			2
‘ clearing that pond was one of my least favourite jobs , ’ admits @entity1			1
‘ when we moved in you could walk across it on dead trees and bulrushes			0
’ the couple bought several more acres of land when a neighbour put them on the market , bringing their total to more than ten acres			1
‘ we had delusions of grandeur , ’ jokes @entity1			2
‘ but it was a chance to protect our view and add to the peaceful tranquillity			0
’ he has restored all the outbuildings with the same dedicated craftsmanship as the house			2
the piece de resistance is the oast house , which was just circular brickwork when the couple moved in			2
it is now a beautiful two - bedroom guesthouse which could easily be turned into holiday accommodation			1
the @entity15 have reluctantly decided to sell , putting the house on the market for £ 1.995 million			1
now that @entity1 is 76 and @entity0 74 , a large house is more than they want to maintain			1
more importantly , @entity1 admits : ‘ i have n’t had the same interest in the place since it was finished			2
’ the couple are proud of their efforts , and whoever buys @entity25 will be the beneficiary of 38 years of loving attention and creative renovation			1
so where will the couple downsize to – surely not a 1970s bungalow ? ‘ we ’re open to ideas , ’ laughs @entity1			1
‘ but it has to be somewhere that fires our imagination			0
