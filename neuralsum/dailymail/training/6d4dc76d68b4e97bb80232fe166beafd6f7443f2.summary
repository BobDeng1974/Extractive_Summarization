by @entity0 @entity2 ' first acting role was in @entity3 with @entity4 when i was boarding at @entity6 i 'd really enjoyed acting , so after i 'd flunked my a-levels and spent eight months in @entity8 , staying with my father who was in the @entity10 , i returned to the @entity11 to pursue my dream			1
by the time i was 19 , about six months after i 'd finished at @entity14 in @entity15 , i went for my first film audition as an actor			2
i was living in a not very nice part of @entity15 , renting a room for Â £ 38 a week and working in a nightclub while applying for work			1
the day i went up for the audition in @entity23 was very exciting			1
it was for a @entity26 film called @entity3 with @entity4			1
i had n't done a film audition before so i met the director @entity28 and read for him			0
he said he was n't entirely sure i was suitable for the role but promised to call me later			1
as i caught the train back from @entity23 to @entity15 that afternoon i picked up a newspaper that had been left on the seat and it randomly fell open on the horoscopes page			0
the advice for @entity35 , my star sign , was sage			0
' something you do today will colour not only the next few days but the months and the years ahead , ' it read			0
i thought , ' well , that sounds good to me			1
' i tore out the horoscope , put it in my wallet and went home			2
in the end i did get the job , and spent three days filming in @entity47 near @entity48			0
as it was such a small part , i did n't get a car to pick me up and rather embarrassingly i was late on my first day and kept @entity4 waiting for 45 minutes			1
unfortunately , after closing numbers i did n't get another role in film or tv for a long time , but i kept that clipping in my wallet and it became my mantra as a reminder not to give up			1
i slogged away in rep theatre gradually learning my craft - i did n't feel i had any other options - and when i was n't acting i 'd work in factories just to keep the money coming in			2
@entity2 ( left ) in @entity3 in 1993 , he believe he owes the role to a horoscope then , just as my career began to blossom - much to the relief of my parents , who thought acting was just a passing phase - i lost the clipping			1
but it had served its purpose , inspiring me to keep plugging away when times were tough			0
my latest role in @entity75 is a fantastic job			2
spending six months in a beautiful place like @entity78 , working with a great cast and dodging hurricanes is a dream come true			0
i 'd never been a fan of astrology and to be honest i do n't believe anyone could make predictions for one - twelfth of the population , but on that day those random words in a newspaper really struck a chord with me			2
i can still quote them , that 's how much of an impression they made			0
i 'd like to think it was my persistence and talent that got me where i am ... but who knows , maybe it was written in the stars too			0
series three of @entity75 is out now on dvd and available to buy from @entity100 .			0

@entity2 earned his first acting role in @entity3 with @entity4
he got the part the same day a horoscope said his life would *change*
he kept the horoscope clipping as a good luck charm
