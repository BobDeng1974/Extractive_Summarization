two brothers from @entity1 have come up with a novel idea - a book so small you need an electron microscope to read it			1
@entity6 , currently the world 's smallest book , is a reproduction of a 30 - page tale that fits on the width of a human hair			1
the reproduction , which is printed with pure crystalline silicon , cost a staggering $ 15,000 ( around £ 9,250 ) to create			1
the book 's exact measurements are 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres			0
the pages , which are too small to be read even using a microscope , are printed on a single tablet a single word from the world 's smallest book - teeny @entity21 by @entity22 it was written by @entity22 and published by his brother , @entity24 , at the @entity25 , in @entity26 , @entity1			1

its pages , which are too small to be read even using a microscope , are printed on a single tablet			2
@entity34 's story , @entity32 said , is one of triumph - where the main character wins an annual turnip - growing contest			0
@entity6 is a reproduction of a 30 - page tale that fits on the width of a human hair following the minute book 's inclusion in the @entity44 , @entity24 , who works as a fine artist , then raised enough money via a @entity49 campaign to create a large print version of his brother 's story			1
@entity24 , from @entity54 , @entity1 , wrote on his @entity49 page : ' in 2007 i was permitted access to a focused ion beam and scanning electron microscope at @entity25			1
' in my time working with this equipment i designed and published an original work on a microchip , as an array of 30 tablets			2
' the tablets contain the text of ' @entity6 ' complete with an @entity68			2
' in 2012 i received a @entity44 confirming my creation of the smallest book yet made			0
' the original , tiny version of the book has the @entity68 reference number @entity68 - 978 - 1 - 894897 - 17 - 4			2
@entity24 said : ' through my practice as a fine artist i met @entity76 at the [ @entity25 ] university 's physics department , who was intrigued by my carvings and drawings			0
' we decided i would be a good fit to work on a project together at the nano lab. @entity6 is pictured here next to minute scratch			0
the world 's smallest book is so tiny that you need an electron microscope just to read it @entity34 ( left ) is the main character in the worlds smallest book			1
these words in the book ( right ) say ' @entity34 from turnip town was standing in the street singing his favorite turnip tune and tapping with his feet ' ' @entity22 had written the story of @entity34 as a diversion from a dull undergraduate economics paper sometime in the late 20th century			2
' i revisited the idea , and decided that i would use the text to design and publish the world 's smallest book			0
' i was pleased with how the book turned out			0
' everyone likes @entity34 : its simultaneously creative non-fiction and a success story			0
' the book is printed pure with crystalline silicon and cost a staggering $ 15,000 ( around £ 9,250 ) to create the original , tiny version of the book even had its own @entity68 reference number ( @entity68 - 978 - 1 - 894897 - 17 - 4 )			1

can only be read using an electron microscope as words are so tiny
