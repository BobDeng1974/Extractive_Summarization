for three months , @entity13 has been aware of a secret tape in which the author of the official £ 3million inquiry into the debacle said he made a ‘ mistake ’ in his final report			2
in a recording leaked online yesterday , @entity1 admitted ignoring bombshell claims suggesting the @entity8 ’s former director - general was specifically warned about the disgraced @entity24 ’s sex abuse yet allowed glowing tributes to be screened after @entity12 ’s death			1
despite being handed a transcript of the conversation in september , @entity13 has repeatedly refused to reopen the investigation and even warned one mp he could be sued if he attempted to publish it			0
at the heart of the row is a conflict between one of the @entity8 ’s most powerful female executives , director of radio @entity37 , and former director - general @entity3 , now chief executive of the @entity39			1
mr @entity3 was in charge of the @entity8 when a devastating tv report into @entity6 ’s predatory past was shelved , sparking a wave of recriminations that culminated in the resignation of his successor			1
his repeated assurances that he was never told about the sex - abuse allegations were accepted by the @entity1 inquiry			1
in the official report published a year ago , mr @entity1 said he had ‘ no reason to doubt mr @entity3 ’s account ’			2
but in the tape recording , mr @entity1 privately admitted to a journalist that his report had been flawed			2
he had been handed a letter by lawyers acting for @entity59 which directly contradicted mr @entity3 ’s evidence			2
she said she warned mr @entity3 about the contents of the @entity5 investigation in a phone call in december 2011 , weeks before a @entity67 tribute to @entity12 aired			1

@entity81 mp @entity94 , who sits on the @entity96 culture media and sport committee , said the chairman ’s position is ‘ untenable ’ , adding : ‘ @entity13 has become a joke			0
any credibility he had left has completely evaporated			0
’ last night , the @entity79 said it was taking the recording ‘ seriously ’ and had passed it on to mr @entity1 so he can give his version			0
a spokesman added : ‘ there was no legal threat – the letter merely suggested mr @entity80 might want to satisfy himself the recording was not defamatory , should he decide to release it			0
