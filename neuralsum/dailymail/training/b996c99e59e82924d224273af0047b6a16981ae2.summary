professor @entity0 , who claims his research on global warming is being ' covered up ' a scientific study which suggests global warming has been exaggerated was rejected by a respected journal because it might fuel climate scepticism , it was claimed last night			1
the alarming intervention , which raises fears of ‘ @entity12 ’ pressure for environmental scientists to conform , came after a reviewer said the research was ‘ less than helpful ’ to the climate cause			0
professor @entity0 , a research fellow at the @entity16 and one of five authors of the study , said he suspected that intolerance of dissenting views on climate science was preventing his paper from being published			1
‘ the problem we now have in the climate community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of a climate activist , ’ he told the @entity24			0
prof @entity0 ’s paper suggests that the @entity34 ’s environment might be much less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought			1
if he and his four co-authors are correct , it would mean that carbon dioxide and other pollutants are having a far less severe impact on climate than green activists would have us believe			0
the research , if made public , would be a huge challenge to the finding of the @entity48 ’s @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , that the global average temperature would rise by up to 4.5c if greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were allowed to double			1
the paper suggested that the climate might be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than had been claimed by the @entity47 in its report last september , and recommended that more work be carried out ‘ to reduce the underlying uncertainty ’			1
the five contributing scientists submitted the paper to @entity59 – a highly regarded journal – but were told it had been rejected			2
a scientist asked by the journal to assess the paper under the peer review process reportedly wrote : ‘ it is harmful as it opens the door for oversimplified claims of “ errors ” and worse from the climate sceptics media side			1
’ prof @entity0 , 79 , said it was ‘ utterly unacceptable ’ to advise against publishing a paper on the political grounds			2
he said : ‘ it is an indication of how science is gradually being influenced by political views			2
the reality has n’t been keeping up with the [ computer ] models			0
professor @entity0 currently works for the @entity81 at the @entity16 ‘ if people are proposing to do major changes to the world ’s economic system we must have much more solid information			1
’ next year the @entity48 hopes to broker an international agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , a replacement for the @entity91 which would impose legally binding targets on every country			0
the last attempt , at the @entity96 conference in 2009 , ended in disaster , with recriminations flying and all chances of a deal in tatters			0
the @entity103 conference in december 2015 is thought by many politicians to be the last realistic chance for a deal to be made if disastrous climate change is to be averted			2
a controversy at this stage risks putting the science which underpins the negotiations at doubt , something many - not least politicians in @entity114 and the @entity115 - will be keen to avoid			0
the publisher of the @entity59 journal last night said professor @entity0 ’s paper had been rejected because it contained errors and did not sufficiently advance the science			1
a spokesman for @entity121 said : ‘ the paper , co-authored by @entity0 , was originally submitted to @entity59 as a research letter			2
‘ this was peer - reviewed by two independent reviewers , who reported that the paper contained errors and did not provide a significant advancement in the field , and therefore failed to meet the journal ’s required acceptance criteria			0
‘ as a consequence , the independent reviewers recommended that the paper should not be published in the journal which led to the final editorial decision to reject the paper			0
