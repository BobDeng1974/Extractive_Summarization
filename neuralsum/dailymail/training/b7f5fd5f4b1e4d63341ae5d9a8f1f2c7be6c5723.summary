by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:34 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 11:30 est , 17 january 2013 a prototype inflatable module is to be tested aboard the @entity4 to give astronauts an extra bedroom , @entity2 has announced			1
the inflatable module can be compressed into a 7ft tube for delivery , and is being heralded as a key component of future exploration and the development of commercial space travel and research			1
it is designed by @entity16 , based in @entity17 , which has been awarded a $ 17.8 million ( £ 11m ) test project for the inflatable room - and hopes to develop space hotels and even planetary bases using the technology			1
@entity2 is expected to install the module by 2015 @entity16 president @entity27 , left , and @entity2 deputy administrator @entity31 with a one third scale model of the inflatable room echo 1 , launched in 1960 was the first inflatable space craft			1
the @entity2 communication satellite rose 1,000 miles into space as a balloon			2
it was dubbed a ‘ sateloon ’			0
in 1961 an inflatable space station was proposed and a prototype built by @entity2			1
it was intended to be manned by one or two astronauts but it was never launched			0
with the development of kelvar and other materials , the inflatable concept was revived in the 1990s , with @entity2 creating the @entity47			2
budget cuts meant it was scrapped in 2000			0
astronauts will test the ability of the bladder , known as the @entity53 , or @entity53 , to withstand heat , radiation , debris and other assaults			0
some adventurous scientists might also try sleeping in the spare room , which is the first piece of private property to be blasted into space , @entity2 said			0
@entity31 , @entity2 ’s deputy administrator , said as she unveiled the contract award that the inflatable module concept is simultaneously cutting edge technology and affordable			1
‘ this partnership agreement for the use of expandable habitats represents a step forward in cutting - edge technology that can allow humans to thrive in space safely and affordably , and heralds important progress in @entity76 commercial space innovation , ’ she said			1
‘ @entity77 is a unique laboratory that enables important discoveries that benefit humanity and vastly increase understanding of how humans can live and work in space for long periods			0
’ part of @entity2 ’s interest in the inflatable technology is prompted by its potential for deep space missions			1
if the module proves durable during two years at the space station , it could open the door to habitats on the moon and missions to @entity98 , @entity2 engineer @entity90 said			1
the agency chose @entity27 for the contract because it was the only company working on inflatable technology , said @entity2 deputy administrator @entity31			2
an artist 's rendering of @entity16 's balloon - like module attached to the @entity4 founder and president @entity27 , who made his fortune in the hotel industry before getting into the space business in 1999 , framed the gambit as an out - of - this - world property venture			1
he hopes to sell his spare - tyre habitats to scientific companies and wealthy adventurers looking for space hotels			2
@entity2 is expected to install the 13ft blimp - like module in a space station port by 2015			1
mr @entity27 plans to begin selling stand - alone space homes the next year			1
the new technology provides three times as much room as the existing aluminium models , and is also easier and less costly to build , mr @entity90 said			0
artist renderings of the module resemble a tin - foil clown nose grafted on to the main station			2
it is hardly big enough to be called a room			0
mr @entity90 described it as a large closet with padded white walls and gear and gizmos strung from two central beams			0
@entity16 founder and president @entity27 with his inflatable module			2
he hopes to use it to create the first space hotel ms @entity31 said sending a small inflatable tube into space will be dramatically cheaper than launching a full - sized module			1
' let 's face it ; the most expensive aspect of taking things in space is the launch , ' she said			2
' so the magnitude of importance of this for @entity2 really ca n't be overstated			0
' the partnership is another step towards outsourcing for @entity2 , which no longer enjoys the budget and public profile of its heyday			0
the agency has handed off rocket - building to private companies , retired it space shuttles in 2011 and now relies on @entity164 spaceships to transport @entity76 astronauts to and from the space station			1
@entity2 deputy administrator @entity31 and president and founder of @entity16 @entity27 in front of what could become one of the first space hotel rooms if the @entity2 scheme is a success , the inflatable technology could be used to built the first space hotel			1
a 60 - day stay will cost 25 million dollars ( £ 15.6m ) , which does not include the 27.5 million dollars ( £ 17m ) it costs to get there and back , believes mr @entity27			1
mr @entity27 predicted that the primary customers would be upwardly mobile countries including @entity183 , @entity184 and the @entity185 that ' have a difficult time getting their astronauts into orbit ' and could use a private space station to barter and build up prestige			0
he said the @entity2 brand would enable him to begin selling @entity193 habitats several times the size of the test module			0
' this year is probably going to be our kick - off year for talking to customers , " he said			0
" we have to show that we can execute what we 're talking about			0
' mr @entity27 , who launched a small prototype of the module in 2006 after licensing the patent from @entity2 , will rely on @entity205 and @entity206 rocket developer @entity203 to provide transportation			0
the biggest technological challenge will be transporting the collapsed module through the sub-zero temperatures of space without tearing or cracking any part of it , mr @entity90 said			2
when it arrives at the space station in 2015 , scientists will blow it up and let it sit for a few days to test for leaks			0
if it does not hold as promised , @entity2 will take back a portion of the already bargain - basement price it paid @entity27			0
@entity16 founder and president @entity27 , with a third scale model of the inflatable module standing beside scale models of research stations on @entity98 and the moon , mr @entity90 said the project will encourage commercial ventures to follow the path @entity2 blazes into space			1
he added that it could also help achieve the holy grail of space exploration : missions that send astronauts out of orbit for more than a year			1
' the only way to do that is to expand it out and , voila , you have living space for three people to go to @entity98 , ' he said			0
' you can get three times the volume of a metallic can , and you can go up in the same ferry			0
' a model of a concept space station made with @entity16 habitat modules the experimental unit , the @entity53 , is intended to be easily launched because it takes up much less room than conventional space craft yet once in orbit is inflated to be much bigger			1
@entity27 hopes that while providing practical solutions to space research , the modules will also serve as craft that can provide accommodation and working space for astronauts in orbit			2
the inflatable unit seen in comparison to one of the @entity4 modules			1
two or more inflatables could be linked up to provide extra working and living space			0
inflatable space modules are intended to provide more room for the astronauts based in them			1
its stated aim is ‘ to provide affordable options for spaceflight to national space agencies and corporate clients ’			0
previously , the company has launched two other inflatable modules but this is the first time it will be tested as part of a manned craft			1
@entity285 1 was launched in in 2006 and genesis 2 in 2007 , both on @entity164 rockets , and are still in orbit			0
each has been tested to ensure a constant temperature and pressure can be maintained within the inflatable hull			2
@entity27 last year announced a link up with the @entity203 company which is working to create @entity297 spacecraft that can carry passengers into space			0
the intention was that @entity203 would transport people into space where they would transfer to orbiting @entity27 inflatables			2
among the potential projects that @entity27 is looking at is building a base on the moon constructed from a series of linked inflatable modules .			1

inflatable modules hailed as cheaper to launch and transport
can be compressed into a 7ft tube for delivery
