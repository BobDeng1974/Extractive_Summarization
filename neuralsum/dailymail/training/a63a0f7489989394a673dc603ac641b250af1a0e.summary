a tiny b&b in the @entity1 has won a landmark legal victory against holiday review website @entity3			2
@entity5 , 64 , launched a small claims action at @entity7 over what he says are ‘ false and malicious ’ criticisms of his guesthouse in @entity11 , which the site refused to take down after being posted by its users			1
he maintained the website lost him valuable bookings of around £ 2,000 by refusing to remove the ' untrue ' comments			1
@entity5 claimed that negative comments posted about his guesthouse are false and should have been removed by @entity3 criticised : the guesthouse at the centre of the legal dispute until now , @entity3 , which is based in the @entity24 and worth around $ 4billion , has denied it was subject to @entity27 laws and could therefore not be sued			1
it previously challenged the jurisdiction of the @entity30 court claiming the firm is outside the remit of the @entity30 legal system because it is based in @entity34			0
however , mr @entity5 ’s lawyer , @entity35 , a solicitor who is more used to crofting cases , won a concession from the firm which has agreed it can be sued in @entity30			0
the floodgates could be opened to people suing global website travel guide @entity3 after the significant victory won by a tiny b&b splendid isolation : mr @entity5 's guesthouse enjoys beautiful surroundings , with mountains and beaches on its doorstep but it was a bittersweet victory for mr @entity5 as sheriff @entity51 ruled in @entity3 ’s favour over transferring the action to a higher court , which requires him to hire a lawyer and be exposed to unlimited expenses			1
an appeal is being lodged and is expected to be heard in @entity59 in two months			0
if it goes ahead , the case will now pivot on the legal interpretation of @entity3 ’s website terms and under the basis of the @entity64			0
the floodgates for legal action against the site could now open , because the decision could be cited in cases outside @entity30 .			2

guesthouse owner wins the right to take legal action against website in @entity30
@entity5 claims ' false ' criticisms lost him bookings worth £ 2,000
he must now block @entity3 's *bid* to take the dispute to a higher court , where he could lose thousands in legal bills
