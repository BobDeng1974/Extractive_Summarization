by @entity0 published : 21:38 est , 15 september 2012 updated : 21:38 est , 15 september 2012 man with a pram : @entity3 , at @entity4 where he was the first male student , with his ' reality baby ' @entity3 makes for an unlikely @entity6			1
the 18 - year - old is a keen second - row rugby player , his cooking repertoire extends only to boiling some pasta and heating a jar of sauce , and he ca n’t even sew a cushion			1
he also admits , without the faintest trace of irony , that until recently ‘ i did n’t think such things as nannies existed			2
i thought they were just in children ’s books and films ’			1
in fact , his only hint of domestic prowess is washing his own dirty socks			2
‘ i have a washing machine and it ’s not hard to use , ’ says @entity3 in his very first interview			1
but @entity3 has just become the first man to study for a degree at the prestigious @entity4 in its 120 - year history			1
at the end of his four - year course , he will join the ranks of the supernanny elite , some of whom have gone on to care for the children of royals , pop stars and the super-rich in @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , commanding salaries up to £ 50,000			1
despite spending the next four years in an all - female environment , there ’s nothing in the slightest bit girly about @entity3			1
yes , he will be having a stab at quilt - making and how to change a nappy , but he ’s also a down - to - earth sort of man			1
@entity3 confesses to being a rather sporty type with a love of the outdoors and has a steady girlfriend who thoroughly approves of his unusual career choice – as does his mother , who inspired him to apply to @entity58 in the first place			1
any jibes about spoons full of sugar and nursery rhymes are taken philosophically			2
and no , he does n’t believe it is controversial to employ a man as a nanny – it gives parents a choice , he explains			1
‘ any situation in which my male friends can turn a phrase on me and make people laugh they ’ll do it , ’ he chuckles			2
however , his girlfriend , @entity75 , an 18 - year - old first year history student at @entity76 , is ‘ very supportive ’			1
‘ i ’d like to think i ’ve given her the impression so far that she does n’t need to worry about me being in a class with48 girls , ’ says @entity3			1
he adds : ‘ it is intimidating going into @entity58 for the first time			2
the gates do paint quite a picture			0
i was walking in on the first day and as i came down the steps , there was a rippling effect of whispers – and then silence			0
i did get a few looks			0
‘ the whispers did n’t last too long , though			0
i found some girls i knew and things soon went back to normal			0
a lot of the girls ask me how i ’m coping with being the only male there			0
it ’s good that they ’re so supportive			0
’ ' 9am : so many things to remember ! no drinking and pramming in public - and never ever leave a baby in a @entity102 ' raised by @entity6 , a bookshop owner , and @entity104 , a civil servant at the @entity105 , @entity3 spent his early years moving between @entity106 and @entity107 with his father ’s work			1
‘ mrs @entity110 , my second year teacher in @entity107 , is my role model , ’ he says			1
‘ i was at an age where school was the last thing i wanted to do but she made it more enjoyable			0
to recreate that would be amazing			0
’ in 2003 , @entity3 ’s family moved to @entity118 and to @entity119 , before returning to @entity107			1
@entity3 later attended @entity120 in @entity121 , where he took up rugby until a slipped disc hampered his progress in the sport			1
his sister @entity127 , 17 , and brother @entity126 , 12 , still attend schools in @entity107			0
‘ coming to @entity129 was a shock as the only schooling i ’d known was in @entity107 , ’ he admits			0
‘ in @entity134 the buildings were all very open , the weather was lovely and i enjoyed outdoor activities such as camping			0
’ @entity3 took a-levels in theology , philosophy and design technology , but decided on a career working with children after volunteering to teach maths and @entity144 to disabled children at the @entity146 in the @entity107 capital , @entity148			1
' 5pm : it 's not all work being the only man in a class of 49			1
we have so much in common : we love children and matching beige uniforms ! ' ‘ a lot of the children had cerebral palsy and many could n’t speak @entity144 , or speak at all in some cases			1
that pushed me in the direction of working with children , ’ he says			1
‘ i really enjoyed helping them learn how to how to hold pencils and also move objects through different shaped holes			0
’ however , he balked when his mother first suggested that he should apply to @entity4 , which is now based in @entity121			1
‘ i knew about @entity58 and the idea of it can seem quite intimidating as the college has such a reputation			0
at the time i did n’t even know if @entity174 took on male applicants			0
’ however , after speaking to ‘ @entity176 ’ who were sub-letting his parents ’ house in @entity121 and looking at their timetables , @entity3 decided to apply to join the ba ( hons ) course in @entity182			1
@entity174 was the only college he applied to			0
what attracted him was @entity58 ’s graduate success rate – it has been reported that the average @entity186 receives 15 job offers upon graduation			2
‘ because it was my only option , the interview was even more nerve - racking , ’ he recalls			2
open - minded celebs : @entity191 , left , and @entity192 , right , have had male nannies ‘ i was wondering what the receptionist ’s face would look like when i arrived and said i was there for an interview			2
there was a slight look of bemusement , but actually she was very professional			0
’ known as the @entity202 of nannies , @entity176 have been hired by @entity203 and the @entity204 , as well as @entity205 and @entity206			0
for a few years , ‘ mannies ’ became all the rage with @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity191 , @entity210 , @entity192 and @entity211 all employing men to care for their children			1
and yet they remain a rarity and the debate continues over whether ‘ mannies ’ should bathe , dress and tend to young children			2
earlier this month , more than 300 parents joined a fierce debate on the @entity224 website			0
the majority were in favour of male nannies but a sizeable number raised objections , which ranged from fears for a child ’s safety to a man ’s ability to do the job as well as a woman			1
despite this , eight out of ten parents say that it is more acceptable now than ten years ago to hire a male nanny , according to a survey conducted in 2009 by @entity242 , one of the largest domestic recruitment firms in the @entity245			0
‘ some families could hold the view that women are more inherently nurturing of children			2
’ asked how he would try to allay the fears of reticent families , he replies diplomatically : ‘ it ’s their choice			0
’ though he was determined to work with children , he was initially uncertain about joining @entity58 , whose female students wear an @entity257 - style uniform of fawn dresses , sensible lace - up shoes , hats and prim white gloves			1
‘ when my mother first put forward the idea of going to @entity58 , i said “ no way , ” ’ he admits			0
‘ you walk around @entity121 and see the uniform and know what it represents			0
what put me off was the fact that i did n’t think i ’d fit in			0
’ however , after speaking to former students , @entity3 did a u-turn and sent in his application form			1
his decision has earned him the nickname @entity276 among his male friends , many of whom are bemused at his unlikely career choice			0
after being accepted on the course , he was given his own tailor - made @entity186 uniform – a tweed blazer , a fawn tie embroidered with the ‘ n ’ logo , a cream shirt and chinos from @entity288			2
only one other male student has passed through @entity4 , but @entity3 is first to take a degree			1
in 2005 , @entity292 , from @entity293 , took a three - year diploma			1
at the time , @entity292 said : ‘ i do n’t see any problem			0
my careers adviser hinted that it was very female - dominated , but i took no notice			2
‘ my male friends call me the @entity276 , but my female friends are very supportive			0
‘ my father also said it was a great opportunity			0
some people would think he was hard on me but there was no problem			0
females might already have certain experiences but there ’s nothing that @entity174 ca n’t teach me			0
’ the degree course is a mix of classroom lessons and practical experiences			2
it costs £ 13,710 a year for the first two years and £ 4,120 a year for the final two years			1
past @entity176 have been taught how to drive on icy roads without skidding , how to sew a rag doll , prepare a home - made chicken curry , and how to massage a child to sleep – a skill likely to be popular with some celebrities			2
@entity191 recently said that she often massages her six - year - old son moses to sleep			1
@entity3 says : ‘ being male might help me appeal to a family with more boys than girls			1
they might want a male role model for their children			2
‘ i ’m not saying that would n’t happen with female graduates , but it could be to my advantage			0
‘ of course , some people might hold the view that it is a female profession and that women are more inherently nurturing of children			2
‘ it ’s their choice , but hopefully there will be people who see it as an equal gender job			2
’ posing proudly for photographs with his @entity257 - style @entity347 pram and his impeccably - behaved reality baby ( @entity4 forbids it being called a doll ) , @entity3 says : ‘ being male and a nanny has never been a concern			1
i do n’t think that gender should be held against somebody			0
‘ one week in and already , i feel part of the @entity174 family			0

@entity3 is the first man to study for a degree at @entity4 in its 120 - year history
he will join the ranks of the supernanny elite , some of whom have gone on to care for the children of royals
he could command a salary of up to £ 50,000 a year in his new job
