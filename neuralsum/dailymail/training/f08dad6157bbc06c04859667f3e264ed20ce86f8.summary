the @entity4 ' much - feared @entity3 is the toughest part of the 32 - week training course said to turn ' civilians into commandos ' , and looking at these astonishing photographs , you can see why even the strongest recruits dread it			1
exhausted , demoralised , and covered in foul - smelling sludge from head to toe , these @entity4 recruits hope one day to wear the coveted @entity17 marking them out as the elite of @entity20 's fighting forces			1
captain @entity48 , who oversees physical training at the @entity4 @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity25 , said : ' the @entity3 is about instilling a @entity4 state of mind			1
' the recruits spend up to 45 minutes in the mud that is so thick they can barely run , doing exercises and games , and it is so difficult that getting through it really builds team spirit			2
' we are not just looking for physical strength but mental resilience as well , and the team cohesion that comes from getting through the hardship together - this strength and cohesion forms part of the @entity4 ' dna			1
' he said the recruits would not necessarily know when the run was coming up , saying : ' it 's all about dislocation of expectation			2
' their boilersuits offer little protection from the stinking slime as their superiors bawl at them to do press ups , and crawl on hands and knees through the mire left by the receding tide in the @entity24 beside their training base in @entity51 , @entity25			1
the agony and determination etched on the recruit 's face shows the tenacity needed to earn the @entity17 worn by those who pass the commando training course gruelling : the @entity3 are the most feared part of the 32 - week training course at the @entity51 military base on the mouth of the @entity24 the beautiful setting of the @entity24 in @entity25 belies the horror of what the future @entity4 have to go through - sometimes more than once nowhere else in @entity20 is there a military base right at the gaping mouth of a river : the @entity24 offers the perfect ground for obedience training bawled at by their superiors , the recruits haul themselves along on their stomach , soaked from head to toe in stinking tidal mud this exhausted @entity4 recruit resembles something out of a science fiction film as he lugs a traffic cone through the foul - smelling mud nowhere else in @entity20 is there a military base right at the gaping mouth of a river , and the officers take full advantage of the noxious mire left by the @entity124 for some hardcore obedience training			1
a dreaded rite of passage , the infamous @entity3 are n't a regular fixture , but occur as and when officers deem them necessary			0
generally they are held towards the end of the training course , just before the young recruits are awarded their coveted @entity134			2
sometimes they take place sooner than that , and sometimes more than once			0
and as one of the toughest part of the @entity4 ' training course , they are designed to weed out those unable to cope , and create a bond amongst those strong enough to survive			2
with barely an inch not covered by wet mud , the recruits are forced to crawl on hands and knees through the slime as they are barked at by their superiors the @entity3 take place as and when officers deem them necessary - generally towards the end of the training course but sometimes near the start , and sometimes more than once officers use the @entity3 to improve recruits ' discipline , obedience and teamwork - vital once they are deployed as @entity4 ' there are two key aims we 're trying to achieve ' , explained corporal @entity160 , troop commander for 164 @entity161 who are in their fourth week of training			1
' firstly , instilling the ethos of team work and the commando qualities of courage , determination and cheerfulness			0
the troop are still early on in their training and they 've not yet started to gel as a single unit which is important			0
' the second is discipline - they understand what is expected of them but their discipline levels are n't where they 're supposed to be at this stage			0
' eventually , after training and passing out they will be deployed with a @entity187 unit elsewhere , ready to go out on operational duties - so any discipline issues , to do with basic things like shaving and cleaning weapons that they are constantly forgetting to do , need to be ironed out early on so they do n't manifest later when they 're deployed			0
' hopefully the run will have achieved its aim			0
' becoming a @entity4 involves passing what many believe to be the most rigorous and relentless training course there is - as these images show not so much running as crawling : exhausted recruits pull themselves through the mud , some so tired they let their heads sink into it , face - down looking more like the @entity207 statues on @entity208 than elite fighting troops , the men summon all the strength they have to get through the ordeal			1

notorious run is part of gruelling 32 - week @entity4 training course that ' turns civilians into commandos '
it 's held ' when necessary ' in the foul - smelling mud of the @entity24 near their @entity51 training base in @entity25
run designed to improve recruits ' *stamina* , strength , and team - spirit - and to weed out those who are n't up to it
