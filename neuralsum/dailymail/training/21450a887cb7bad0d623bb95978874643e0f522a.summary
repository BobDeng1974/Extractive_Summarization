@entity1 , 24 , filed the suit for unspecified damages , after she was arrested by two officers last july in @entity4 's @entity12			1
miss @entity1 , from @entity13 , @entity8 , had been relaxing on a bench without her top when she was told to cover her breasts			1
the officers , one male and one female , who approached the young woman told her to put on a shirt and asked for @entity22			2
she responded that it was her right to sun herself topless , citing a 1992 @entity25 , which states that baring one 's chest in public is legal for a woman as it is for a man			1
in may , the @entity2 released an official memo informing all police officers that it is not illegal for women to walk around the city shirtless , and that they should not be cited for public lewdness or indecent exposure			2
however it did not stop the officers from hauling miss @entity1 down to the precinct in handcuffs where she was arrested and held for five hours			1
she was charged with obstruction of a sitting area but the charge was later dropped			0
her lawyer @entity43 told the @entity44 : ' the female cop picked up @entity1 ’s shirt and forced it onto her			2
' she did n’t resist in any way or fight in any way			0
they arrested her and cuffed her , and took her to the precinct			0
' the lawsuit was filed at @entity53 this week leaving the city 's law department to review the case			2
miss @entity1 , from @entity13 , @entity8 , had been relaxing on a bench with her top off when she was told to cover her breasts by two @entity2 officers miss @entity1 's lawsuit is the latest incident to draw attention to discrepancies in the law over women going topless			1
like most @entity69 states , it is not illegal for a woman to have an exposed chest in @entity8 anywhere that it is okay for a man to do the same			1
however , it has not stopped individuals being cited for ' public indecency ' or ' disorderly conduct '			0
in july , model @entity79 and photographer @entity81 made a statement about female nudity at trendy @entity86 restaurant @entity84 in the @entity87			0
miss @entity79 sat at a table with her breasts exposed while mr @entity81 pulled out his camera to snap the scene			0
@entity84 's owner @entity91 rushed over the table and demanded that the half - naked woman put her clothes back on			2
in response , miss @entity79 insisted that it was ' perfectly legal ' to go topless in the restaurant			0
after exchanging a few words with the owner , the couple were escorted out of the bistro			0
despite the legislation because a restaurant is private property , its patrons are subject to whatever rules the business has in place			0
taking a stand : miss @entity1 , a performance artist , has sued the @entity2 for unspecified damages after being arrested for going topless in a @entity4 park			1

@entity1 , 24 , filed the suit for unspecified damages , after she was arrested by two officers last july in @entity4 's @entity117
it is legal for a woman to bare her chest in @entity8 in the same places it is for a man
