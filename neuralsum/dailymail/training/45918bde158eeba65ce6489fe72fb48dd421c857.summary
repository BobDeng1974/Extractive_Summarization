as @entity1 slunk home from the @entity3 , @entity0 handed general manager @entity4 his no 10 shirt from the tournament			1
it was a touching gesture , thanking @entity4 for his support in @entity9 before @entity0 ’s world fell apart amid allegations about his personal life			0
this time , @entity0 is taking steps to make sure that his @entity15 experience in @entity17 is considered a success			1
a week ahead of schedule , he boarded a plane bound for a holiday on the @entity23 on monday night with two @entity25 fitness coaches for company			1
it is on the lush training pitches of the @entity48 do @entity51 complex that @entity0 ’s preparations will begin			2
next monday , the rest of @entity54 ’s 23 - man squad , plus @entity55 and @entity56 , will join @entity0 in @entity57 for the @entity15 training camp			1
@entity1 ’s manager said : ‘ @entity0 is so determined to be up and running when we get there on the 19th			1
he ’s going there with two trainers			0
i do n’t know who exactly but @entity65 ( @entity25 ’s head of fitness ) has been in touch wanting to know about the pitch			2
‘ @entity0 ’s attitude is that he ’s desperate to be up and running on the 19th			0
i ’m not as desperate , i ’m thinking more of june 14 , but it ’s still quite laudable			0
‘ i ’m not trying to dissuade him			0
if they ’ve got houses out there , that ’s where they go on their week off			0
they do n’t all go to @entity78 and @entity32			0
someone had to mention the gambling capital of the world and it was @entity54 who duly brought up @entity0 ’s preparations for his previous international tournament			1
two years ago @entity0 spent time at the craps tables of a prominent @entity32 casino before he joined up with the @entity1 squad to prepare for @entity34			1
in the end , @entity1 were the biggest losers			0
revealed : @entity1 manager @entity54 ( centre left ) announced his @entity15 squad on monday time to shine : @entity0 has endured a succession of injury - hit and frustrating tournaments with @entity1 ahead of the @entity15 in @entity17 , @entity0 is showing admirable maturity after missing @entity25 ’s last three games			1
had they been critical fixtures he could have played , but @entity99 , @entity25 ’s interim manager , acknowledging the importance of this @entity15 , gave him some time off			1
this is another chance for @entity0 to prove he really is one of the best footballers in the world			0
the @entity1 forward has yet to score at a @entity15 — an incredible statistic given his standing in the game			2
the @entity15 , which starts for @entity1 on june 14 against @entity109 in @entity110 , could be 28 - year - old @entity0 ’s last chance and he seems determined to take it			1
@entity54 said : ‘ it ’s up to @entity0 if he wants to go away			2
i ’m more than happy for the players to forget about football for a week and to get mentally prepared for the weeks ahead			0
’ the tournament may be a long slog for @entity1 ’s players and @entity0 , notoriously , has found it difficult to cope with extended periods away from his family home in @entity122 , @entity123			2
the real deal : @entity0 is instrumental to @entity1 's @entity15 hopes fighting fit : @entity25 's head of fitness @entity65 has been in contact with @entity54 in 2006 he was sent off in the quarter - final against @entity129 and four years later , under @entity130 in @entity9 , he was in meltdown			1
after @entity0 shouted his criticism of @entity1 ’s travelling fans into a tv camera following a desperate 0 - 0 draw against @entity137 , the team were taken apart by @entity138 and were heading for home			1
at full throttle @entity0 is still @entity1 ’s main threat , a player with immense pedigree after another decent scoring return during qualifying			2
he has been in good nick for @entity25 this season , netting 17 goals during a difficult year under the sacked @entity149			0
‘ i hope he will join in with us straight away on the 19th , ’ said @entity54			0
‘ let ’s hope he can show the form that makes @entity0 what he is			0
’ fully fit , you can put your shirt on him			0
it 's time : @entity0 needs to perform at a @entity15 after some lacklustre performances on the big stage not risking it : injured @entity0 has been rested in @entity25 ' final games of the season			1

@entity0 has gone on holiday to *recharge* ahead of @entity15
two fitness coaches have travelled with @entity0 to aid his preparations
@entity25 star has not played since april *26* *due* to groin strain
@entity0 is under *pressure* to perform for @entity1 after series of poor displays in major tournaments since @entity178
