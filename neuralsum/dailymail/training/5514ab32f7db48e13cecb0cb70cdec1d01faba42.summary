by @entity1 reporter published : 03:25 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 05:14 est , 16 may 2012 they do say it 's lonely at the top , so @entity6 's new president @entity5 must have been grateful for a helping hand from @entity9 chancellor @entity8 yesterday			1
mr @entity5 was the guest of honour at a red - carpet ceremony in @entity12 , but the @entity6 newcomer looked decidedly out of his element - understandably nervous as the world watched the first meeting between @entity18 's new power duo			1
it was an ominous first day for mr @entity5 , having been soaked through by a torrential downpour during a parade in @entity6 , and then arriving late for his meeting with mrs @entity8 after his plane was struck by lightning and had to be diverted			1
later , as mrs @entity8 spoke of her determination to keep up the @entity44 - @entity9 cooperation that flourished under mr @entity5 's conservative predecessor @entity45 , mr @entity5 fumbled in his pocket for pen and paper to take notes			1
when it came to his turn at the microphone , mr @entity5 repeatedly used hands and arms to stress how reasonable his arguments were			0
shoulder charge : when hand signals would not do the trick , mrs @entity8 resorted to a good old - fashioned barge to get mr @entity5 moving in the right direction we made it : by the time the two leaders had finally found their way to waiting reporters , it looked like mr @entity5 had relaxed a little bit - to the relief of mrs @entity8 off to a bad start : mr @entity5 's excessive hand gestures and talk of amending mrs @entity8 's @entity18 policies did not endear himself to the @entity9 chancellor while the two leaders talk about wanting to continue the status quo between their two countries , a body language expert might have had more to say on mr @entity5 's intentiions			1
at one point , mr @entity5 explained why he wanted to tamper with mrs @entity8 's fiscal pact , agreed by 25 @entity18 states , to make it more growth - oriented			1
mrs @entity8 simply shrugged and smiled at reporters			2
the @entity9 leader and mr @entity45 were so different in character that aides thought they would never get along			0
raining on his parade : in weather that could have been orchestrated by his opponent @entity45 , the heavens opened on mr @entity5 's motorcade through @entity90 still chucking it down : mr @entity5 endured more outdoor ceremonies in the rain yesterday as he placed flowers at the monument to the unknown soldier at the @entity97 this never happened to the other guy : mr @entity5 looks like he might be regretting his decision to run as @entity6 leader after his inauguration mrs @entity8 , a physicist from the @entity103 who guards an intensely private home life , seemed polar opposite to mr @entity45 - dubbed ' president @entity106 ' because of his flashy tastes and marriage to self - promoting singer / model / actress @entity110			1
but the two conservatives saw eye - to - eye on the euro crisis to such an extent that media commentators lumped them together as a single entity - ' @entity118 '			2
however , it might take some time before the world starts hearing of ' @entity122 '			0
mr @entity5 's first day in office was not so much a baptism of fire as it was a baptism of water - and lightning			1
the man dubbed ‘ mr @entity129 ’ by the @entity6 endured a first 24 hours in charge that were anything but normal			0
the day started well enough , with the new leader exchanging pleasantries with outgoing president mr @entity45 at the @entity134 - and being sworn in as the seventh president of the @entity136			0
but it all went downhill from there			0
poking through the sunroof of a small £ 25,000 hybrid @entity142 , and surrounded by guardsmen on horse - back , he was driven up the @entity145 waving to well - wishers			0
but - in weather that could have only been choreographed by mr @entity45 himself - the heavens opened and rained heavily on mr @entity5 ’s parade			2
by the time he arrived at the @entity97 , he was a mess ; his black suit and white shirt clinging to his body , and water dripping uncharismatically from from his spectacles			0
if he thought things would improve when he boarded his plane to meet mrs @entity8 , he was wrong			2
his @entity159 was hit by lightning and he was forced to return to @entity90 , to board a second aircraft			0
@entity162 one : to add to mr @entity5 's woes his plane was hit by lightning as he flew to @entity103 for a meeting with @entity8			2

@entity167 watches as @entity18 's new power duo get to know each other
body language shows @entity6 and @entity9 leaders have a long way to go match the ' eye - to - eye ' relationship of mrs @entity8 and @entity45
@entity5 's first day *includes* being drenched and ' struck by lightning '
