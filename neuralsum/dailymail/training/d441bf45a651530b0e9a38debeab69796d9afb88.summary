anyone expecting @entity1 to undergo a radical last - minute change of @entity4 heart and come out all guns blazing under @entity6 can think again			1
@entity7 may have gone but the one - day game - plan remains the same			2
@entity6 ’s first public appearance as the new one - day captain , a low - key affair here ahead of the warm - up game against a @entity14 , would have dashed the hopes of those expecting a dramatic transformation			1
in confirming that @entity18 has the first chance to step into @entity7 ’s @entity4 shoes @entity6 emphasised that @entity21 has it all to do if he is to become the flag bearer at the top of the order for a new , more dynamic 50 - over @entity1			1
@entity6 will captain @entity1 's one - day team for the first time since taking over from @entity7 @entity6 addresses the press ahead of his side 's match against a @entity14 @entity18 looks set to open the batting for @entity1 with @entity33 at the @entity4 in february @entity18 was due to open with @entity33 at the @entity34 and will be given every chance to complete an unlikely journey from the periphery of the one - day side to taking on @entity39 in the @entity4 opener on february 14			1
it means that even though @entity7 has been jettisoned at the last minute @entity1 remain committed to having an experienced , more ‘ orthodox ’ player as opener to try to play the anchor role rather than two big ‘ @entity46 ’ hitters			1
@entity18 gets the nod even though he was dropped after two matches of @entity1 ’s one - day series defeat against @entity51 and would have almost certainly missed out on being in the squad at all had @entity7 survived the cut			1
now , though , a last , big one - day opportunity comes knocking at 32 for one of @entity1 ’s classiest test players but a man who has often under - performed in one - day cricket , scoring just three hundreds in 150 50 - over appearances			2
‘ belly is a class act , someone we ’ve looked to for a long time to score a heavy weight of runs , ’ said @entity6 while insisting that there is still time for @entity21 and others to stake a claim			2
‘ he ’s pretty key at the top of the order			0
’ the new one - day captain sounded very much like the old one when asked whether @entity1 need to be more aggressive if they are to make any impact in the triangular series that begins on friday and next month ’s @entity4			1
@entity6 confirmed in @entity74 it is the veteran @entity18 who will be given the first opportunity to claim @entity7 's place @entity79 one - day captain @entity6 ( left ) does not believe there will be a big change in captaincy style ‘ i think we have been aggressive , ’ insisted @entity6			1
‘ we ’ve made the change slowly and we saw glimpses of it in @entity51			0
it will be a continuation of that in this @entity4 but what i ’d like to see is us combining that aggression from the younger players with one or two experienced ones to bat around them			0
’ so the tactics will remain the same but @entity6 is sure to be his own man as @entity1 captain			1
‘ my method has always been to strip the game back to its absolute basics and make sure the atmosphere in the camp is pretty relaxed , ’ said the @entity97			0
‘ the only differences to @entity7 will be in character and a little bit of a change in beliefs			2
i have a simple way of viewing things as a captain			0
’ an example of his laid - back manner came in the way he slept through all @entity1 ’s attempts to contact him in @entity115 before @entity116 to tell him he was succeeding @entity7			1
‘ i woke up to a lot of voicemails , ’ smiled @entity6			2
@entity119 ( right ) and @entity120 are certain to take two positions leaving one more up for grabs @entity123 ( right ) is in a battle with @entity125 and @entity126 to be @entity1 's third seamer ‘ the first person i spoke to was @entity129 who offered me the captaincy — and i obviously said yes — and then @entity131 phoned me and said “ you must have slept well ” because i had 25 missed calls			2
to be fair , it was 4am ! ’ once the news sunk in @entity6 remembered that captains usually get a big say in selection			2
‘ @entity129 gave me an inkling of what the squad was going to be			0
he asked me if i would have any changes and i said “ no , that ’s our best squad ”			0
’ that means there was no attempt by @entity6 to try to find a way back for his exiled friend @entity150 , who he has publicly supported during @entity1 ’s civil war while also managing to remain close to @entity7			1
‘ the decision was clearly made a year ago that @entity150 was n’t going to be part of @entity1 cricket moving forward , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ it was repeated on the day i became captain			0
i did n’t think about asking for that to be changed			0
’ @entity6 described as ‘ ambitious ’ the offer made by @entity150 , presumably at least with part of his tongue in his cheek , to play for the @entity163 prime minister ’s @entity14 in @entity1 ’s second warm - up match here on wednesday			1
as it is any hopes @entity150 may have had of playing against @entity1 were dashed when @entity168 was called up to replace the injured @entity169			2
@entity18 partnered @entity33 in a practice match on saturday , giving the clearest indication yet that the pair will open @entity18 chats to @entity1 batting coach @entity173 during saturday 's nets session in @entity74 ‘ it ’s a prestigious game so to think they might give a place to someone who is not @entity163 is ambitious , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ but i do n’t think it would have spiced the game up if @entity181 had played against us			0
it really does n’t bother me			0
’ what has bothered him are the feelings of @entity7 , who looked certain to be @entity1 ’s @entity4 captain right up until a late change of heart by @entity1			1
‘ @entity7 was the first person to message me to wish me well , ’ revealed @entity6			1
‘ we get on very well			0
when a decision like that is made it ’s not very nice but it sums the guy up that he wished me all the very best			0
‘ i felt for him massively			0
it will be difficult for him but that ’s the decision that was made and once we start here it will be a case of moving on			0
’ another captain with much to contemplate is @entity200 who admitted he has his work cut out to play in the @entity4 even though he was named in a formidable looking @entity163 squad			0
@entity200 has been given to @entity204 ’s second cup game against @entity205 on february 21 to prove his fitness otherwise he will be replaced , so it looks increasingly like he will at least miss the date with @entity1 at the @entity209 on @entity210 that launches the tournament .			0

@entity6 was named @entity1 captain after @entity7 was dropped
@entity18 will be handed chance to step into @entity7 's shoes
