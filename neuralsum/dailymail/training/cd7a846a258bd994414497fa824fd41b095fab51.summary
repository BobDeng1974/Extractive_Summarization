by @entity0 published : 13:26 est , 14 july 2012 updated : 13:40 est , 14 july 2012 @entity2 lifestyle : @entity3 would munch his way through the equivalent of 20 bars of @entity7 , or 25 @entity8 , in one working day taste tester @entity3 appeared to have the dream job - sampling sweets , chocolate , toffees and other confectionery all day long			1
but the much - envied father of five has been forced to leave his role as @entity18 ’s ‘ chief @entity16 ’ - after piling on two stone			1
the 47 - year - old , who worked from a cosy office at his home in @entity23 , @entity24 , decided it was time for a change after the doctor told him his cholesterol was dangerously high			1
mr @entity3 has now retired from his post as a taste tester - and his job editing @entity3 ’s @entity32 - and intends to concentrate on a writing career			1
the father of five was eating up to 2lbs of ingenious new treats - including cocoa - covered ants and aphrodisiac lollipops - every day			1
the high - calorie diet caused his weight to balloon to 13 - and - a - half stone and doctors warned he risked a heart attack if he carried on			2
now the former champion rower has embarked on a strict exercise regime and cut all chocolate from his diet in a bid to return to his normal weight of 11 - and - a - half stone			2
he said : ' eating chocolate for a living really was the dream job			2
i was given a @entity52 to sample the world ’s craziest , tastiest new goodies and review them in the magazine			1
' the only problem with eating chocolate from 9 to 5 , of course , is the predictable weight gain and high cholesterol			2
' in the last couple of years , i ’ve put on some considerable weight and a recent check - up showed my arteries were far from fighting fit			0
sweet deal : but the 47 - year - old is leaving his job after developing ' dangerously high ' cholesterol ' it was with regret that i stepped down from the magazine to concentrate on a less harmful - but certainly less sweet - career			0
' mr @entity3 has been editing the magazine for the last 20 years			0
he was dubbed ‘ @entity2 ’ in october 2010 after some of the world ’s biggest manufacturers hired him as a chocolate taster			1
after landing the taste testing job , he sampled more than 200 new products per month - around 30,000 in total - while earning £ 30,000 - a - year			0
manufacturers including @entity80 and @entity81 relied on his experience and sophisticated palate to sample new treats ahead of production			1
at a trade show , he would often eat up to 3lbs of goodies - approximately 20 bars of @entity7 or 25 @entity89 - in less than 12 hours			0
his monthly magazine is more than 120 years old and is sent to 5,000 subscribers worldwide			0
but following the birth of his fifth child earlier this year , he decided to have a check - up - and was told to quit the chocolate or face a ' future of ill - health '			0
mr @entity3 has now employed a new editor and a team of tasters , but added : ' i ’ll really miss being @entity2			0
