by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:07 pm on 12th august 2011 @entity2 will tonight hold an emergency cabinet meeting to bring in reforms aimed at dealing with @entity6 's mounting debt crisis			1
the @entity6 prime minister is expected to slash public spending and impose new taxes on the wealthy in an effort to slow the rate at which the country is piling on debt			2
the meeting - set for 7pm local time - comes in response to demands from the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) for urgent measures to spur economic growth and balance the budget by 2013			0
troubled economy : @entity2 , @entity6 's prime minister , left , and finance minister @entity24 attend a debate in the upper house of parliament in @entity28 @entity30 markets have swung wildly this week on rumours that indebted eurozone governments are teetering on the brink of a new debt crisis			1
after days of criticism for a lack of clarity on its plans , @entity2 's centre - right government looks set to levy a ' solidarity tax ' on high earners and raise the tax level on the financial sector			1
the measures were agreed in late - night discussions between mr @entity2 and economy minister @entity24 ; but other steps , notably those concerning pension reform , remain to be decided			0
the government must make € 20billion of extra savings and revenue to meet its new balanced budget target and reassure investors it can control debt running at 120 per cent of gross domestic product			0
mr @entity2 and mr @entity24 held a series of meetings yesterday with president @entity59 and @entity61 governor @entity60 as they scrambled to nail down details of the package			0
the ' solidarity tax ' would take the form of an extra 5 per cent on income above € 90,000 and a 10 per cent addition to tax on income above € 150,000 , business daily @entity65 reported			1
the tax rate on financial income is set to jump from 12.5 per cent to 20 per cent , with the exception of income from government bonds - the sale of which are crucial to @entity6 's continued solvency			1
further measures could include a bid to raise the number of working days in a year by ensuring that non-religious public holidays , such as the june 2 anniversary of the founding of the @entity6 , are celebrated on a sunday			2
the market chaos which threatened to spin @entity6 's borrowing costs out of control last week has eased since the @entity19 intervened to buy up huge chunks of the country 's debt			1
while @entity6 's budget deficit is below the euro - zone average and should shrink to around 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product this year , the country 's sovereign debt passed the € 1.9 trillion mark in june			1
but the continuing fear among investors that the eurozone 's third largest economy is running an insustainable course have led to sharp falls on @entity6 stock markets			0
stock market regulator @entity104 today announced a temporary ban on short - selling financial stocks in a bid to calm the volatility that has hammered @entity6 bank shares			0
in response , the main @entity111 index was trading nearly 2 percent higher earlier today			0
despite its huge public debt , @entity6 had remained on the sidelines of the eurozone crisis until last month when doubts about the government 's unity and capacity to control its finances triggered a massive sell - off of @entity6 bonds			1
proud history : tourists at the @entity125 , @entity28			0
many local public services will be privatised after demands from the @entity19 @entity6 media reported that prime minister @entity2 was considering issuing a special video message to explain the austerity plan , which will fast - track a number of measures contained in a € 48billion package passed last month			2
but major disagreements remain and sensitive reforms to the pension system remain undecided , with @entity2 's @entity138 coalition partners and @entity6 's biggest trade union both strongly opposed to any cuts			2
yesterday , mr @entity24 told a parliamentary committee that the @entity19 had demanded measures to break down barriers to competition in services and the professions and free up rigid labour market rules			0
the recommendations included privatisation of local public services , more flexible employment contracts , easier hiring and firing to free up the rigid labour market and cuts to public sector pay			2
additional measures included increasing the retirement age for women working in the private sector and a change in rules on when workers can retire based on their pension contributions			0
mr @entity24 said the proposals on hiring and firing and cuts to public sector pay , both of which would raise fierce political opposition , were not in the government 's plans .			1
