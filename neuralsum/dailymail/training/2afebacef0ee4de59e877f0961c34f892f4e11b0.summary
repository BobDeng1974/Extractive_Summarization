@entity18 threw their weight behind a concerted effort by football to have the ban – imposed as part of the criminal justice @entity26 after an @entity25 riot that year – lifted on a limited basis for a short trial period			1
supporters are keen to see @entity3 football 's booze ban lifted and be put the same as others across @entity8 the ban was imposed as part of the criminal justice @entity26 after an @entity25 riot that same year supporters threw their weight behind an effort to have the ban lifted on a limited basis for a short trial period following on from @entity42 chief executive @entity41 's confirmation that they 'd been in discussions with the police , the fans ' umbrella group revealed that a survey of supporters earlier this year had shown 62 per cent in an immediate scrapping of the regulations , while 72 per cent supported the idea of a small - scale trial			1
although @entity53 , @entity54 , urged caution and pointed out that certain demographics – female supporters and the over- 60s – were resistant to lifting the ban , a statement on behalf of the group said : ' @entity3 football has made impressive strides in improving its image over the last 35 years , with several clubs taking greater responsibility for the health and well - being of their supporters			1
' we encourage those involved in these discussions to consider all relevant factors in any decision made regarding a change to the current restriction on alcohol in @entity3 football			1
' @entity10 initially responded by sticking to the same firm line they 've held since 1980 – but with one small suggestion of wiggle room , as long as the public are consulted			0

to my knowledge this has not been done as yet			0
' @entity3 conservative leader @entity112 , who has spoken out on this issue before , said : ' i 'm pleased to see @entity10 are prepared to engage with a wide - ranging consultation on drinking at the football			1
' it 's a discussion that needs to happen			2
we are not in the same situation we were when alcohol was banned from the stadium			0
grounds are safer and the atmosphere much more family friendly in general			0
' it 's also unfair that , if you pay £ 100 for a hospitality ticket you can enjoy a drink , but ordinary fans in the stands are denied this			2
' more and more stadia have alcohol licences because they host other events like concerts , but at 3pm on a saturday the taps have to be switched off			0
' let 's have a proper discussion of the issues and a pilot scheme , instead of insisting that football fans in practically every other country in @entity8 are responsible enough to drink at the ground , but in @entity3 they are not			1
