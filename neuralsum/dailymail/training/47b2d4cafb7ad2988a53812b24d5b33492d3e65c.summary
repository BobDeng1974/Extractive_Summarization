' @entity4 , the quintessential fashion doll , up as a role model for @entity10 simultaneously sexualizes young girls , idealizes an impossible body type , and undermines the @entity10 ' vital mission to build ' girls of courage , confidence and character , ' said @entity59 , director of the @entity61 - based commercial - free childhood organization			1
she said the @entity4 patch — targeted at 5 - to - 8 - year - old daisies and @entity64 — would transform these girls into ' walking advertisements			1
' ' this is product placement at its worst , ' said @entity69 's executive director , @entity68 , who described herself as a longtime admirer of the @entity10			0
' our children are already being bombarded by marketers ' pitches at stores , at home , online , on tv , and in school , ' said @entity68 , whose @entity79 , @entity80 - based group tries to counter the commercialization of @entity3 culture			0

' patch up : the @entity10 ¿ partnership with @entity8 , announced last august , includes a @entity4 - themed activity book , a website , and a @entity4 participation patch ¿ the first girl scout uniform patch with corporate sponsorship that 's the essence of the @entity4 uniform patch — a bright pink oval with a gold - letter slogan stitched on it : ' be anything			1

anticipating the criticism that ensued , @entity8 promoted the campaign with the catchword ' unapologetic			0
' in announcing the partnership with @entity8 last year , @entity10 ceo @entity118 depicted both her own organization and @entity4 as ' @entity3 icons			1
' ' together , we are teaching girls that their futures are wide open with possibilities , ' @entity122 said at the time			0
@entity128 , in an e-mail thursday , said @entity8 gave the @entity10 $ 2 million to implement the @entity4 - themed initiatives			1
at the time the partnership was announced , the @entity10 were struggling financially , with revenue shortfalls prompting the national headquarters to trim about one - fourth of its staff through buyouts and layoffs			2
objections : the specific patch that the consumer group objects to is the ' @entity140 , @entity142 ' participation patch that allows @entity10 to explore career choices through an activity booklet that also has a @entity4 tie - in the @entity11 said the @entity146 - themed website included a game that would encourage girls to identify careers based on attire — ' from a veterinarian in a frilly miniskirt , to a pink - suited @entity3 president , to a race car driver in stilettos			1
' said @entity59 , the campaign director : ' the website is little more than an interactive ad for @entity4 promoting the brand 's insidious message that women really are what they wear			1

it now reports a membership of 54,000 , many of them parents			0
good match : @entity8 executives say @entity4 and @entity10 are a natural fit			2
' aligning with the @entity10 mission , @entity4 has inspired girls ' imaginations on their journey to self - discovery , allowing them to explore a world without limits ' the group 's advocacy campaigns have achieved numerous victories , notably in forcing several companies to halt or modify advertising claiming that certain videos and other products could help infants learn			1
it also has helped block proposed state laws that would have allowed advertising on school buses			0
the @entity13 , a nonprofit founded in 1997 , says its mission is to help @entity3 reduce and modify the level of consumption " to improve quality of life , protect the environment , and promote social justice			0
" due to their size and high profile , the @entity10 have been a frequent target of criticism over the years , notably from certain conservatives who contend — despite the @entity10 ' repeated denials — that the organization tilts toward the abortion - rights side of the national abortion debate			2
