by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:20 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:12 est , 31 december 2013 suffering the @entity4 bulge already ? consider one of the latest celebrity workout dvds			0
this year the overriding theme is high intensity training ( hit ) — or short , sharp interval sessions lasting around ten minutes			0
two years ago @entity12 researchers found that people who did four to six 30 - second sprints with a three to four - minute recovery three days a week lost more than twice as much body fat as those who ran for an hour at a steady pace three times a week			1
other studies have shown similar regular hit sessions get you aerobically fitter quicker than slogging away at slow exercise			0
we asked @entity24 from the @entity25 , @entity26 , and the elite fitness trainers at @entity28 to rate the latest fitness dvds			1
toned : @entity31 's @entity30 , tv presenter @entity32 and @entity34 's @entity33 have all released workout dvds - but which will get the best results ? other studies have shown similar regular hit sessions get you aerobically fitter quicker than slogging away at slow exercise			1
we asked @entity24 from the @entity25 , @entity26 , and the elite fitness trainers at @entity28 to rate the latest fitness dvds			1
not for beginners : performing some of @entity41 's yoga moves could be difficult @entity43 ’s @entity42 £ 2.99 ; @entity44 the promise : this is the second yoga dvd from @entity47 , who played @entity48 in @entity49			1
it features three 45 - minute yoga workouts — one focusing on the whole body , the second aiming to strengthen the abdominal muscles , and the third working the lower body			1
verdict : this is for intermediate level yogis			0
while @entity41 mentions modifications for beginners , few are fully demonstrated			1
many people think yoga is good for them so may launch into this thinking it perfectly safe			1
but if anyone with knee , shoulder , wrist or lower back problems attempted them a slightly wrong technique , it could exacerbate problems			0
watch the dvd before attempting the workouts to get an idea of the moves as some are complex			1
do n’t twist yourself out of position to watch the screen — this could cause neck and shoulder strain or lower back pain			0
best for : experienced yogis 4/10 @entity33 fit in 30 days £ 9.99 ; @entity87 the promise : @entity34 star @entity33 offers a 30 - day programme consisting of five workouts , devised and co-presented by her trainer @entity91			1
the ten to 15 - minute sessions include four different exercises , such as dumbbell work			2
the idea is to complete between 10 and 40 repetitions of each exercise consecutively , with a 45 - second break within each session			2
poor technique : @entity34 's @entity33 ' dvd is pitched at beginners , but lacks instruction verdict : this is pitched at beginner to intermediate level exercisers and you only need dumbbells and a mat. the basic concept is good , but it lacks concise instruction			1
for example , it does n’t say how many complete workouts you should complete in 30 days - you ’d probably have to do it at least three times a week to get results			2
@entity33 ’s technique is often poor and is n’t corrected by @entity91			1
beginners are likely to follow suit			2
advice on good technique seems to take a back seat and there is little encouragement offered			2
best for : those who like following strict programmes and know what they ’re doing			0
1/10 top of the class : our experts praised @entity32 's short , clearly presented workouts @entity136 : fit in 15 £ 20.42 ; all major stockists the promise : the fitness dvd queen @entity32 has sold nearly two million dvds in nine years			1
co-presented with trainers @entity143 and @entity145 , her tenth offering embraces the hit trend and claims to get you fit after 15 minutes exercise a day			0
there are four 15 - minute workouts — targeting strengthening and toning of arms , legs and abdominal muscles — plus the ‘ @entity154 ’ which includes 30 - second bursts of jumping , kicking and squats for ultra-fast fat - burning			2
verdict : the instructions are clear and there are well - demonstrated options for advanced or easier versions			1
there ’s also great advice on stretching and cooling down , which prevents blood pooling in the muscles			0
start with sessions as stand - alone workouts , as fitness improves do three or four in one day , on non-consecutive days			1
best for : anyone looking for all - round results 10/10 @entity173 ’s 21 day fat burn £ 20.42 ; all major stockists the promise : former @entity176 winner , @entity173 , lost six stones in around six months and is following the success of her best - selling fitness 2012 dvd with three new workouts			1
this 80 - minute dvd contains four 20 - minute workouts			1
the first three develop speed , stamina and strength through interval training ( repeated periods of effort in longer bouts that you ’d get with hit )			0
the final workout is a fitness test involving you counting how many times you can perform a particular exercise in 60 seconds			2
the advice is to do one or more of the workouts three or four times a week in 21 days - which could apparently lead to half a stone weight loss			2
transformed : @entity176 star @entity173 has slimmed down to a size 10 after yo - yo dieting verdict : the emphasis throughout , particularly in the final fitness test , is how many exercises you can perform in a set time			1
this is a great idea if you are experienced , but if not it is better to slow down and improve your technique			0
it ’s risky to do exercises fast and repetitively if you ’re doing them wrong as it could lead to repetitive strain injuries and mean you might not use muscles effectively			0
there are no easier alternatives but instruction is clear , it seems fun , it ’s a good introduction to regular workouts and will make a difference if you stick to it			1
best for : regular gym goers 5/10 on the reality bandwagon : @entity176 's @entity173 enocurages a speedy workout , while @entity230 's @entity30 is praised as being good for beginners - with quick results @entity30 7 - day slim £ 19.99 ; all major retailers the promise : @entity230 ’s @entity30 says she has dropped from a size 16 to a six doing these workouts every day			1
there are six ten - minute workouts that get progressively harder , presented by @entity30 and trainer @entity239			1
the idea is to do workout one ( the easiest ) daily for the first week , workout two daily for the second week and so on until you have completed all of them			0
then you do two to four workouts every day			0
trim : @entity230 ’s @entity30 has dropped from a size 16 to a six doing her workouts every day verdict : the format of this is physiologically sound and the build up from easy to difficult workouts is a good touch			1
progression is important in fitness as you can get injured or lose motivation by doing too much , too soon			2
@entity30 demonstrates the hard version of each move and @entity239 does the less demanding			1
no equipment is required and all moves use your body weight for resistance — so there ’s numerous lunges , push ups and squats which are very effective at strengthening and toning the entire body			0
sometimes views of the moves are compromised by camera angles			0
but overall it is a great regimen that will make a difference in six weeks			0
best for : beginners looking for quick results			2
9/10 @entity277 total body collection £ 24.99 ; @entity87 @entity279 : former gladiator @entity281 's dvd is for experienced exercisers the promise : ex-international athlete , @entity281 , also known as former @entity286 , has released a three - cd set providing ‘ over three hours of body - shaping workouts ’			1
the first , @entity289 , is designed to boost fat loss in three , 20 - minute workouts			2
the second , @entity293 , features strength - based workouts designed to tighten the arms and shoulders , legs and bottom and our midsection			2
the third , @entity302 , provides a mix of fat blasting and toning in five ten - minute workouts which can be done on a pick and mix basis			2
verdict : these dvds are aimed at experienced exercisers			0
@entity281 mentions easier versions of moves , but they are never shown			0
in the @entity313 section on the ‘ blitz ’ dvd , there are not enough prompts about positioning such as keeping your back straight and knees soft which could lead to strained back muscles			2
many exercises involve rotation which may cause muscles and ligaments being pulled or strained if done incorrectly			0
there ’s an assumption everyone can do planks — when you raise your body in a straight line supported by forearms and feet — and press - ups , which is untrue			2
if you are fairly fit , there is plenty of variety and doing a mix of sessions three to five times a week would improve fitness			0
best for : those who are already fairly fit and who get bored quickly			0
6/10 ' shambles ' : @entity348 sprinter @entity347 's dvd has shaky camera angles be fit in 90 £ 10.29 ; all major stockists the promise : former @entity354 @entity348 sprinter @entity347 , joins @entity358 war hero - turned athlete and model @entity355 to present this 90 - minute programme			1
it recommends doing five of the 35 - minute workouts a week with two rest days			0
includes a workout calendar , 90 - day fitness journal and nutritional guide			1
verdict : this dvd is a shambles — there are shaky camera angles , trainers rambling on when not knowing what to say , and some of the background trainers are out of sync , or do the exercises differently from the presenters and completely incorrectly			0
there is no explanation of technique before exercises , they jump straight in and just tell you to follow			0
as with any regular exercise you would see some improvements if you followed the workouts , but there ’s too great a risk of people hurting themselves			0
best for : the occasional exerciser.0 / 10 @entity390 fitness blasts £ 14.00 ; @entity391 the promise : biggest loser star @entity394 ’s dvd features six mini workouts of high intensity that take ten minutes each , including a warm up and a @entity313 cool down			1
there are clear instructions on to how far to push yourself , progressions and easy options on most exercises to suit everyone			1
there is a good variety of six to eight exercises for each ‘ blast ’ and @entity394 and her friends ask for a full range of motion for each , which is good advice			0
but using baked bean cans for weights would be ineffective and proper 3 - 5lbs dumbbells would be better			0
this will get results if done four to five times a week doing one mini workout a time , then building to two or three a day			0

*veteran* fitness queen @entity32 wins praise for her clear instructions
@entity30 's dvd - which has topped the *charts* - is good for beginners
but big *brother* @entity173 and @entity34 's @entity33 come under fire
