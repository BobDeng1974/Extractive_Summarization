the @entity1 's @entity0 told @entity2 on thursday that it is investigating whether former @entity1 official @entity3 committed crimes when her office targeted conservative nonproit groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax - exempt status over a three - year period			1
last year irs commissioner @entity10 testified that untold thousands of @entity3 's emails were lost when her hard drive crashed , and that there were no archives of the messages			1
but in a dramatic evening hearing , the @entity16 and @entity17 heard that investigators needed only two weeks to locate 32,774 of them on 744 backup tapes			1
@entity1 higher - ups , they said , had never asked them to look			2
another 424 tapes have yet to be scoured			0
deputy inspector general @entity25 declared that his office is looking at ' potential criminal activity			1
' you 're not entitled to certain documents , ' mr. @entity44 told lawmakers			1
' oh really ? ' shot back @entity55 @entity47 rep. @entity54			0
' we 'll see about that , wo n't we ? ' in a 2014 interview that aired during the @entity60 , president @entity58 told @entity62 host @entity61 that there was ' not even a smidgen of corruption ' in the @entity3 case			1
republicans slammed him at the time for commenting while an investigation was still ongoing			0
neither @entity25 nor @entity44 would describe the contents of any of the emails at thursday 's hearing			2
several @entity40 members questioned how hard the @entity1 tried to produce the emails , given how quickly independent investigators found them			1
@entity75 ? rep. @entity54 , a @entity55 @entity76 , pressed the @entity1 on whether more documents would be forthcoming ' we have been patient			2
we have asked , we have issued subpoenas , we have held hearings , ' said @entity81 rep. @entity39 , chairman of the committee			0
' it 's just shocking me that you start , ( and ) two weeks later you 're able to find the emails			2
' the @entity1 issued a statement saying the agency ' has been and remains committed to cooperating fully with the congressional oversight investigations			2
the @entity1 continues to work diligently with @entity2 as well as support the review by the treasury inspector general for tax administration			1
' the agency estimated it has spent $ 20 million responding to congressional inquiries , generating more than 1 million pages of documents and providing agency officials to testify at 27 congressional hearings			0
@entity99 , one of the @entity102 - linked groups that waited years for its tax - exempt application to be approved , claimed friday that ' the @entity1 was apparently given instruction to do whatever necessary to silence those who spoke out against the @entity106			1
it became a @entity109 weapon of choice			0
' ' @entity110 are beginning to understand that the politics of " hope and change " has an enforcement arm that operates like an organized crime syndicate			0
' @entity3 retired near the end of 2013 , with a full government pension , months after refusing to testify in an @entity40 hearing about how her @entity119 chose to delay applications for years based on the presence of words like ' tea party ' and ' patriots ' in some groups ' names			1
some @entity47 tried to diminish the significance of location thousands of @entity3 's emails , pointing out that the @entity1 does n't yet know if some or all â€“ of them are already included in more than 70,000 other messages the @entity1 has already turned over to @entity2			1
' so as i understand it from your testimony here today , you are unable to confirm whether there are any , to use your own words , new emails , right ? ' @entity141 @entity47 rep. @entity140 asked @entity25			0
' that is correct , ' he replied			0
' so what 's before us may be material you already have , right ? ' she shot back ' that is correct , ' he said			0
@entity140 threw up her hands and wondered aloud : ' so may i ask , why are we here ? ' the @entity1 inspector general set off a firestorm in may 2013 with an audit that uncovered what became known as the ' tea party targeting ' scandal that unfolded during the 2010 and 2012 elections			1
several hundred groups had their applications delayed for a year or more			0
some were asked inappropriate questions about donors and group activities , the audit report said			0
last year the entire @entity165 voted , mostly along party lines , to hold @entity3 in contempt of @entity2 for refusing to answer questions .			2

@entity1 deputy inspector general told a @entity165 panel that his office found @entity3 's emails on backup tapes
the agency had *previously* said the messages were lost when her hard drive crashed , and had never been archived
another official told lawmakers they 're ' not entitled to certain documents , ' bringing one to *mutter* : ' oh really ? we 'll see about that , wo n't we ? '
@entity3 , now retired , presided over the @entity1 's tax - exempt office that was *accused* of playing *favorites* and targeting conservative groups
