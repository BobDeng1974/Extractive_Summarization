miss @entity3 , who has posed for exclusive designers including @entity20 and @entity21 , is working on a range of smartphone cases for an undisclosed fee			1
the collection , due to launch later in the summer , will ‘ apply @entity3 ’s sensibility to the latest handsets ’ , the retailer said last night			2
the company recruited the 39 - year - old model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘ fashion tech ’ – or phone accessories aimed at customers who ‘ are crying out ’ for something more stylish than cheap plastic cases			0
for @entity3 , it may lack the glamour of strutting the catwalks in @entity42 or @entity43 , but @entity44 believes adding her touch to the humble phone case will tempt female customers who see her as a style icon			2
