by @entity0 @entity1 was predictably made to carry the can for @entity4 ’s defeat last night with the image of him doing up his laces as @entity7 scored the winner plastered over every single sports page			1
@entity10 detailed the minute - by - minute of his decision to change his boots midway through the second half as @entity7 attacked down his right flank and scored the goal that could end up losing @entity4 the title			1
on 70 minutes 34 seconds @entity1 took advantage of a @entity7 substitution to change footwear but he was still on the sidelines on 71 minutes 53 seconds when @entity21 scored			1
the ill - timed pit - stop did not finish until 72 minutes 30 seconds when @entity23 came back on with the game out of @entity4 ’s control			0
@entity47 tried to play down the incident saying : ' all the players were upset with themselves for the defeat			0
' but @entity32 ’s anger is clearly directed at @entity1 as he blasts a late free - kick off target with @entity32 feeling he should have taken the kick			2
' he comes from the cradle of rugby - perhaps that is why he puts so many over the bar , ” sniped @entity10 ’ resident critic @entity60			0
are you serious ? @entity4 's @entity26 ( right ) and @entity62 query a decision from the referee heads down : @entity32 ca n't hide his disappointment as he trudges off as the @entity7 players appeal for a decision on the floor : @entity32 takes a tumble after another attempt to get @entity4 back in the game comes to nothing @entity74 : @entity32 celebrates scoring a deflected free kick earlier in the match - but @entity4 still ended up losing it is customary for @entity1 and @entity32 to share free - kick taking duties and on the night both had been woefully off target			1
@entity32 had scored from a first half set - piece but only because the ball hit @entity7 ’s @entity21 on the arm to divert it past @entity85 in the @entity7 goal			1
@entity87 rounded off its savage criticism of @entity1 saying : ' he did not respond to the importance of the game			0
he made the wrong decisions even upsetting @entity32			0
' @entity92 went slightly easier on @entity1 saying he had not been the only player out of position when @entity7 scored			2
but elsewhere he was slated and given a five out of 10 rating alongside the comment : ' it seems he plays better when he has injury problems			0
' @entity4 ’s embarrassment was made complete by the fact that their misfiring 250m euros forward line , had been outdone by @entity21 , a former bus conductor who cost 8m in the summer .			2

@entity4 lost 2 - 1 at @entity7 , leaving them three points behind @entity104 and two points behind @entity106 in the @entity108 title race
@entity1 was off the pitch changing his boots as @entity7 's @entity21 scored the winning goal
the @entity115 media has made @entity1 out to be the *scapegoat* for this title - damaging defeat after a *mediocre* *performance*
@entity32 was also seen to *remonstrate* with @entity1 after the @entity121 blazed a free kick off target
last night was the first time @entity4 have lost two straight league for five years
