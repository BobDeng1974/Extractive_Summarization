@entity0 was embroiled in a fresh ‘ cash - for - honours ’ row last night after the extent of the party ’s financial dependence on millionaire backers who have been made peers became apparent			1
of all cash donations to the party in 2012 , more than £ 600,000 – or 40 per cent – came from just three wealthy supporters – and all three have recently been appointed to the @entity12 by mr @entity0 , a @entity14 investigation found			1
they are among 34 @entity16 who have been given life peerages by mr @entity0 since the 2010 election – compared with an average of only four a year between 1997 and 2009			1
wealthy : the three businessmen who are the @entity16 ' biggest donors have been given seats in the @entity12 this is despite mr @entity0 ’s complaints that the @entity12 is undemocratic and should be fully elected to stop politicians stuffing it with cronies			1
the deputy prime minister is understood to be planning to give several more peerages to @entity16 politicians who were kicked out by voters in the recent @entity35 and local elections			0
mr @entity0 is facing awkward questions over alleged cash for honours after senior @entity16 peer @entity39 quit the party last month complaining he had failed to ‘ expose and end cash for peerages in all parties , including our own ’			1
@entity46 has been urged by @entity48 mp @entity47 , who sparked the cash - for - honours scandal that engulfed @entity51 ’s government , to investigate whether any honours were sold in return for donations			2
awkward questions : @entity0 has insisted the @entity12 should be more democratic he said : ‘ @entity39 ’s comments are bigger than any admission that emerged through the last cash - for - honours investigation			2
we need full disclosure of which members of the @entity12 he is talking about , and what they gave in return for a peerage			2
’ it is @entity16 policy to back a fully - elected @entity12			2
mr @entity0 says it is a ‘ flawed institution ’ with no democratic mandate , held up by an ‘ unsustainable status quo ’			0
but this has not stopped him using his power of patronage as deputy pm to appoint dozens of @entity16 life peers			0
money problems have made the @entity16 even more reliant on their richest benefactors			0
the party was £ 713,000 in debt at the start of this year			0
membership is falling and since forming the coalition they no longer qualify for nearly £ 2million a year in public funding for opposition parties			0
they have become dependent on money from a small coterie of businessmen who have been given prestigious positions in the @entity12 , an analysis of party accounts and @entity91 figures shows			0
mr @entity0 made clothing magnate @entity93 , 70 , a peer in november 2010 , and appointed nightclub impresario @entity96 , 51 , and @entity98 tycoon @entity97 , 56 , to the @entity12 last august			1
the three men gave the @entity16 £ 605,000 in 2012 , representing 40 per cent of the total cash donations of £ 1,494,274 received that year			1
lord @entity93 and lord @entity101 – the latter via his firm @entity103 – were jointly the largest single donors , each giving £ 250,000			0
lord @entity96 ’s @entity106 provided £ 105,000			1
in 2011 they gave £ 408,642 , making up just under 23 per cent of all cash donations			1
they donated the even larger total of £ 632,097 in 2013 , although this can not be compared to the party ’s total income because full accounts for the year have not yet been released			2
allegations : senior @entity16 peer @entity39 ( pictured ) quit the party last month complaining he had failed to ' expose and end cash for peerages in all parties , including our own ' these figures represent only part of the total amount given to the party ’s central office , individual mps and local constituency organisations by the recently - ennobled millionaires and their families over the years			2
@entity131 has donated £ 1,004,757 to the @entity16 , lord @entity101 has provided £ 1,156,326 and lord @entity93 has handed over £ 361,597 , with nearly all of his donations coming since he was appointed to the @entity12			1
' i ’m not saying it ’s as crude as saying , “ you give us £ 100,000 and we will put your name forward for a life peerage ” , but i bet there ’s a few nods and winks ' sir @entity142 , ex-chairman of the @entity143 @entity16 donor turned peer @entity145 , 67 , has along with his wife given the party £ 870,613 since 2005			1
@entity149 , 64 , whose family has donated £ 1,572,492 to the @entity16 since 2004 , was put forward for a peerage last year but was reportedly passed over amid concerns at that time about hospitals and care homes run by his family firm			1
the @entity16 ran a deficit every year from 2008 to 2012 , while membership slumped 35 per cent in two years to stand at just over 42,000 in 2012			0
donors are not banned from becoming peers , but they are vetted by the @entity161 , which rules on ‘ whether or not the individual could have been a credible nominee if he or she had made no financial contribution ’			0
however , it is a crime to sell peerages			0
sir @entity142 , ex-chairman of the @entity143 , said : ‘ all parties , but particularly the @entity16 and to a lesser extent @entity169 , are so dependent on these big donors that they will go to considerable lengths to attract them			0
i ’m not saying it ’s as crude as saying , “ you give us £ 100,000 and we will put your name forward for a life peerage ” , but i bet there ’s a few nods and winks			0
’ the @entity16 and all the @entity12 in question deny suggestions that their peerages were given in return for donations .			2

more than £ 600,000 of cash donations in 2012 from three wealthy men
@entity106 nightclub boss @entity96 has given £ *1m* in total
he and @entity98 businessman @entity97 entered @entity12 last year
a third donor , clothing tycoon @entity197 , was also made a life peer
an earlier *version* of this article reported *previously* published *claims* that @entity149 is an ' arms *dealer* ' . mr @entity149 has *contacted* us to say that he has repeatedly denied dealing in arms . we are happy to make this clear .
