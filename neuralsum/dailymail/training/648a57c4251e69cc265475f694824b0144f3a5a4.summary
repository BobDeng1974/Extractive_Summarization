@entity1 manager @entity0 says bringing jailed striker @entity2 back to @entity3 should be a decision taken by the owner and not at football level			1
@entity2 is due to be released two - and - a - half years into a five - year prison sentence for rape on friday and has been heavily linked with a return to the @entity10 - the club he was at when convicted in 2012			1
the @entity13 outfit have faced a backlash over potentially re-signing the former @entity16 international , with more than 90,000 people signing a petition against his possible re-employment			1
@entity2 was at @entity1 when he was convicted of rape and sent to prison but they are continuing to discuss the matter , with @entity0 only having a small say in the decision			1
' we have had one or two discussions , we are awaiting a decision and the owners will make that in good time			0
' i have been involved in decisions , but it is very much a decision for the owners and when the time is right to say something as a club we will do that			0
' it is that sort of decision - it 's above football level			0
' it 's my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back , it 's not my decision whether he comes back in the first place - that 's theirs			0
' until the decision is made there is no point talking about it			0
@entity0 says any decision to bring @entity2 back to @entity3 will be ' above ' football ' it 's not been distraction within the camp			2
first of all he 's not out yet and secondly the club have n't made a decision and until those two things happen it is irrelevant			0
' @entity2 scored 48 goals in 113 games for the @entity10 prior to his imprisonment , including 35 in 42 games during the 2011 - 12 campaign which was cut short due to his trial and conviction			1
a jury at @entity73 found @entity2 guilty of raping a 19 - year - old woman in april 2012			2
@entity2 admitted having sex with the woman on may 30 2011 , but said it was consensual .			2
