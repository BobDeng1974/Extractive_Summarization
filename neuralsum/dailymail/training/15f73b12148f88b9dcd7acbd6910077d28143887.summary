mr @entity1 said : ' i 'm like a little child who still gets incredibly excited at the sight of a new rollercoaster			1
' as soon as i see the track , i 'm buzzing with excitement and desperate to get on board ' i used to get scared just looking at the height , twists , and turns of some rides - but none of them daunt me anymore			2
' in fact , i 'm more nervous about theme park ghost trains			1
' i tend to ride each rollercoaster several times in a bid to find the best seat , because the experience varies massively depending on where you sit			0
' you get a better view at the front , but you get more g - force at the back , meaning your arms are pinned down by your side and you ca n't move			0
' i like to find a seat where you get lots of negative g - the feeling of weightlessness and your stomach turning			0
' i 'm not much of a screamer			0
instead , i prefer to whoop and cheer as i whizz round , then applaud or punch the air with joy at the end			0
' i get this incredible rush of adrenaline and a real buzz from the rides			0
' it 's a form of escapism , which allows me to forget the stresses of everyday life and lose myself in the moment			0
' mr @entity1 said his partner @entity159 , 34 , ' tolerates ' his hobby and their son @entity161 , two , has notched up a count of three coasters already			1
miss @entity159 occasionally travels abroad with @entity1 , when she allows him a few days to explore the theme parks before returning to a more traditional break			1
he said : ' since having @entity161 , i 'm looking at theme parks in a different way and making a note of those i wish to return to when he gets older			2
' i 'm not pushing my passion onto him but i do hope he will take an interest			0
' he is already fascinated by our local theme park , where he knows how the safety bar works , and has walked straight off a ride and back to the queue			1
' mr @entity1 added : ' from my travels , i 've seen how different nationalities embrace rollercoasters in different ways			1
' the @entity18 and @entity77 keep their heads down , terrified of what 's to come - whereas the @entity91 go wild and shout and scream			0
' in @entity36 , queue - jumping is rife , and i have found myself moving backwards as i wait to board a ride			0
