by @entity0 published : 12:17 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 24 january 2013 since wowing the world on the @entity3 track and dazzling on the @entity4 dance floor , @entity7 's career shows no sign of abating - and she is loving every minute			1
not only has she fronted million pound campaigns and written a bestselling autobiography , but she has also ditched her lycra leggings and firmly established herself on the fashion scene with designers bending over backwards for her to wear their designs and grace the front rows of their shows			0
the 32 - year - old does , however , maintain that she is n't a ' fashion girl ' at all ; even though she wishes she was			2
queen @entity19 : @entity7 launches the @entity21 and the glory campaign in @entity23 dressed in an @entity25 hat , but maintains she is n't girly ' i 'm not a fashiony girl at all really			0
i wish i was , i 'd like to be			0
i like reading fashion magazines and i 've gone to a couple of fashion shows but that 's as far as my whole fashion knowledge and experience goes , ' she told @entity35			2
while she may not consider herself a fashionista yet , she is certainly doing a good job of brushing up on her knowledge from the front row of many prestigious shows			2
' i really like @entity41 , obviously			1
she did such a great job at the @entity3 and she 's been very helpful for finding things when i 've had events , she has always helped me out			2
' i went to @entity41 's @entity46 show last season ; that was pretty exciting , ' she said			1
and it seems that @entity41 is n't her only fashionable friend			1
' i 'm a big fan of @entity51 and he 's a big cycling fan			1
he leaves me voice messages when i 've gone to competitions to wish me luck and to congratulate me			0
' as pretty as a flower : @entity19 looked stunning in her shoot today but says she prefers brogues and ' manly ' buttoned up shirts with her grueling @entity3 training and @entity4 sessions long behind her , she is using her time to catch up on some much - needed retail therapy , which she describes as ' a whole new world '			1
while we were most accustomed to seeing her in tight lycra or glitzy @entity4 dresses , @entity19 considers her signature style to be a little more mainstream and practical , counting her favourite high street shops as @entity70 and @entity71			2
she said : ' it 's definitely nice to be out of @entity66 and tracksuits			0
i had a bit of a tidy up in my wardrobe as was like : " wow i do have a lot of leggings , wow nobody needs this many pairs of leggings and this many pairs of cycling shorts really ! " i realised how few regular clothes i actually own			1
' out of lycra : @entity19 says she is relieved to be able to wear normal clothes and has been catching up on shopping glitz and glam : she loved wearing the glitzy dresses on the @entity4 dance floor but maintains that brogues and shirts are more her signature style talking about her personal style she said : ' i do n't know if it sounds quite masculine and androgynous but i do like brogues and buttoned up shirts - that 's the kind of thing i like and i feel very comfortable dressed like that			1
' i 'd like to wear lots of girly things but i never feel like it 's me so i probably dress a little bit more practically			0
' she did have a chance to embrace her inner girly side on the dance floor in @entity4 , and while she may have been the seventh contestant to leave the show and fast became notorious for her tearful outbursts , she maintains that she loved her time on the show			0
' it was a wonderful experience and i really enjoyed it			0
i loved wearing the glitzy dresses			0
it was really nice to wear something that is so far from what you 'd normally wear			0
but you would n't go out on a saturday night dressed like that ! ' it was really fun to dress up			0
i loved dressing up as a kid , my nanny used to make me skirts and sparkly stuff so how could you not enjoy that ? ' and with many of her fellow olympians such as @entity128 and @entity129 voicing their dreams of launching a fashion line , @entity19 has had a very similar brainwave			0
' i would love to start a fashion line			1
i would really like to start with women 's cyclewear because i think there 's not a lot of stuff out there to choose from in terms of functional sports wear			1
' for now , @entity19 's latest project is launching the @entity144 2013 campaign ' @entity145 '			1
sporting a hat by @entity147 and dress by designer , @entity25 - @entity19 braved the cold elements in a stunning photo shoot that celebrates classic @entity153 style and fashion			1
her trim body is the result of her new found hobby : running			1
' i started running , i 've never been allowed to run before because it 's banned			2
with cycling you do n't run in case of damaging tendons or getting injured			0
' i run with my dogs and i 'm really enjoying it			0
i know it sounds really sad but the freedom of being able to do it is just so enjoyable , ' she said			0
big spender : her favourite high street stores are @entity70 and @entity71 and when she has a splurge , she loves @entity51 front row : she is a regular front row attendee and loved her time in @entity46 at @entity41 's spring / summer 13 show speaking about being a part of @entity144 , she said : ' i was absolutely thrilled to be asked to take part in the shoot today , and i am a big fan of @entity25 and @entity147			1
' i have always loved @entity144 and have been several times , it ’s one of the most exciting events of the summer social season and i was lucky enough to be asked to present the trophy for @entity185 a few years ago			2
' in many ways , with horses coming from all around the world to run at @entity144 , it is just like the @entity3			2
' braving the elements : the olympian posed in the cold climes to launch the @entity144 2013 campaign @entity144 takes place from tuesday 18th to saturday 22nd june 2013 and is the world ’s most famous race meeting , with an annual attendance of 300,000 people			1
