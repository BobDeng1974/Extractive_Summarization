by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity2 referee grandee @entity1 , fortunate to keep his football posts after making a ghastly racist comment to a fellow official , is now involved in another alleged discriminatory issue			1
referee coach @entity7 is taking the @entity2 to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming he has been the victim of disability discrimination by association from an @entity1 - led panel that made him redundant after seven years at @entity13			1
@entity14 , who has had his own health problems , was asked during the redundancy exercise whether his wife ’s illness would affect his availability for coaching			1
trouble : former @entity22 referee @entity21 could have landed in more hot water at the @entity2 it has also not gone unnoticed that three of the other referee coaches who were kept on after @entity7 ’s departure — well - known former @entity22 officials @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 — are named in @entity1 ’s autobiography as ‘ his lifelong friends ’			1
@entity1 had said to black @entity2 employee @entity34 at dinner during a referees ’ summit : ‘ you look tanned , have you been down a coalmine ? ’ he survived as the @entity2 ’s referees ’ chief because no one made an official complaint			1

snooker player @entity46 , who is banned for 12 years for match fixing , will nevertheless take part in a competitive tournament at the @entity50 in @entity51 this weekend			1
as the event is not under the jurisdiction of ruling body @entity54 , @entity46 can play if he pays a £ 60 entry fee			1
but the £ 1,000 first prize will not make much of an inroad into the £ 125,000 costs he owes from failed appeals			1

@entity64 , ringmaster of @entity65 , is understood to have applied for the @entity67 chairmanship for which he is the government ’s preferred choice			2
but that does n’t mean he will end up with the job for which interviews are taking place next week			2
@entity64 , who is said to have put in his application as a formality having been approached to apply , must decide whether he can balance the @entity67 role with his track - and - field ambitions			2
the 57 - year - old is hot favourite to be elected president of the @entity81 in 2015 — and athletics has always been @entity64 ’s first love			2

it has emerged that the @entity93 , at the centre of a @entity89 ticket resale scandal with employee @entity90 now in a @entity92 jail , were involved in the tender for @entity96 ticketing			1
the contract was awarded to @entity98 , who ran into problems at the @entity65			2
but , after their botched services at @entity65 , @entity98 were praised for their @entity103 work by @entity104 on wednesday			2

sir @entity105 , bidding for a cycling track pursuit medal in the @entity96 on thursday , is not known as a team player judging by the in - fighting in the @entity109 cycling camp			0
yet it ’s said he is taking his role as a senior member of @entity113 surprisingly seriously			0
@entity114 has spent time with the younger athletes , including the 13 - year - old and 14 - year - old divers , and mixed with the rugby sevens squad			0

by any relevant measurement , the @entity96 is half the size of the @entity65			0
yet the @entity67 claim to have made significant cuts in staffing levels from 2012 when they employed 765 staff			0

@entity103 say lessons learned from @entity65 were security , security and security — explaining the rings of steel around the city			0
but ridiculously the lockdown at the main media hotel , the @entity143 , meant everyone on arrival , including one as recognisable as @entity146 , had to struggle with suitcases from a taxi drop - off near the hotel half - a - mile to the other side of the secured zone to validate accreditation passes			0
