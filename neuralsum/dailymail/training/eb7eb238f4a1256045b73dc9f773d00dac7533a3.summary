it was @entity2 's big moment : a press conference had been called for 7pm on wednesday , july 30 at @entity4 to unveil the player @entity5 had ' saved up ' for			1
rather than go out and pick a £ 5million player here and an £ 8million player there , @entity5 had let last january drift without doing any significant business so he had a substantial kitty to play with in the summer			2
he knew @entity13 was the man to spend it all on			2
the paperwork took longer than envisaged to complete but at 8.43pm @entity13 – all £ 28million of him – walked in to the media auditorium , accompanied by a beaming @entity5			1
this was what he had wanted ; so enthused was the manager he later said he would have gone to £ 100million			0
@entity13 , pictured reacting against @entity21 , has struggled to hit top form for @entity2 this season the @entity25 , pictured in action against @entity24 , has now gone six @entity27 games without a goal on the back of his outstanding loan spell from @entity33 last season , when he scored 15 goals and helped @entity2 finish fifth in the @entity27 , it was expected that @entity13 and his team would progress hand in hand			1
nothing that balmy night suggested there would be a problem			0
fast forward to mid-winter , though , and @entity13 has struggled to live up to his grand billing			2
@entity5 had an inkling that , after being at the @entity46 , it would take the 21 - year - old time to reach top speed but should he still be waiting for him to get there in the first week of january ? his performance numbers do not suggest major problems			1
@entity13 has scored six times , made two assists and has been regularly available for games			2
there have not been any underlying fitness issues and he has avoided the curse of the hamstring strain that has afflicted some of @entity2 's squad			0
dig a little deeper and you will see the issue is that he is not getting involved enough in games			0
his six @entity27 goals have come at conversion rate of every 14.3 shots			0
the average number for a top end @entity27 striker is above 25			0
is he actually being put into the positions to flourish ? @entity2 boss @entity5 showed great faith in @entity13 when he spent a club record £ 28million on him @entity13 celebrates scoring against @entity72 - one of six @entity27 goals he has netted this season one former @entity2 player certainly does n't think so			1
' if i was @entity13 i would seriously be knocking on the gaffer 's door and saying " seriously , is there any chance of me getting in the game more often ? because i never see the football " , ' @entity81 , a focal point of @entity2 's 1984 - 85 championship winning team , argued			1
' i feel a little bit sorry for him			0
what 's the point in paying £ 28m for a centre forward , who did ever so well last year because we got him more involved in the game than we are doing this year			1
he was a threat and he was a handful			0
' but there is no point in having him up there if we are going to pass it along the back , into midfield , back again , into left back , across to right back , back again and he 's doing little shuttles at the top end of the pitch wondering " when is the ball going to arrive at me ? " ' @entity81 's words carry substance			0
there is a feeling @entity2 are now easy to play against , predictable almost			0
certainly , there has been no game this year where @entity13 has been central to @entity5 hatching a plan , such as when he played from the right and terrorised @entity118 at @entity119			1
@entity2 's players look dejected after conceding the first goal in their 2 - 0 defeat at @entity21 on @entity123 @entity13 celebrates scoring against @entity21 in december but he started on the bench against the @entity125 last week the @entity25 international has n't been able to get into @entity27 games as much as last year @entity13 , a hulking figure who honed his physique during adolescence by doing 150 sit ups a day , has the power to be a formidable target man and @entity2 could utilise his attributes by playing a more direct game			1
that , however , is never going to happen under @entity5			0
yet sympathy for @entity13 can only stretch so far			0
he is only a young man and has to realise he ca n't sit and wait for the opportunities : @entity5 did n't pay £ 28m for him to run on to balls – that fee was paid for the @entity25 to energise @entity2 's forward line , to give them dynamism			1
without a goal in his last six appearances , @entity13 must take that on board on tuesday evening when @entity148 arrive at @entity119 and @entity2 's season precariously balanced			1
now is the time for @entity13 , a man who does not lack for self - confidence , to show he was worth the wait .			2

@entity13 has scored seven goals in all *competition* this season
but he is struggling to find the form he showed while on loan at @entity2
@entity5 spent a club - record £ 28m on @entity13 last summer
the @entity2 have not given the 21 - year - old the service he thrives on
