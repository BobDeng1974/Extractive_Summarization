a group of technologically - challenged senior citizens are left completely and utterly befuddled by popular messaging app @entity2 after attempting to use it for the first time , in order to send the perfect selfie			1
in the latest video from the @entity12 series on @entity14 channel , the clueless men and women are given their first introduction to @entity2 with hilarious - and mixed â€“ results , all of which are caught on camera			1
and while many of them say they understand the appeal of the social media app , which allows users to share photos that will disappear within 10 seconds , they still ca n't really wrap their heads around the point of it			1
' i 'm not into all this , ' a woman named @entity30 says of that app. ' this is yet another play on this " tweet " thing that 's happening			1
' i just found out about @entity52 , ' @entity30 says with exacerbation			1
meanwhile , another confused woman named @entity55 calls the app ' @entity56 '			2
but before the group can start sending pictures , they are given cell phones so they can learn how to snap their own selfies - which proves to be an almost - insurmountable task in itself			1
' i do n't know how to use an @entity65 , ' @entity64 says with a laugh before they get started			2
when @entity55 realizes that the app involves photos , she is disappointed			2
' oh , it 's pictures , ' she says			2
' after they take turns learning how to flip the phone 's camera around , they start snapping away , but most of them are quick to voice their displeasure with their photos			2
feeling nostalgic : @entity82 ca n't wrap her head around the idea that the photos on @entity2 disappear			1
' would n't you want to save it ? ' she asks ' oh god that is a gross selfie , ' @entity88 , father of the @entity93 brothers , the creators of the channel , exclaims , while @entity64 asks : ' can i have a better picture ? that is an awful picture			1
' they soon move on to captioning their own photos , which presents its own set of issues , as the seniors struggle with typing their messages			1
' i just want to say : " it 's me , " ' @entity39 explains with frustration			2
' it looks like it says : " @entity112			2
" ' but almost all of them enjoy the feature that allows them to color on their photos			0
' i always wanted to know what i looked like with a mustache on , ' @entity82 says with delight as she adds purple facial hair to her selfie			0
after they upload their photos to the app , @entity123 asks : ' who would care ? ' perfect users : @entity128 notes that politicians should get on the app because of all of their ' sexting ' and ' nude pictures ' what fun : @entity128 can be seeing drawing a purple bow on her selfie			0
most of the elders enjoy using this @entity2 feature meanwhile , @entity139 has no idea that @entity2 is reportedly worth $ 19 billion			1
' this is definitely going to catch on with kids , ' he says of the technology			0
the revelation that @entity2 is considered disposable social media because their photos will soon disappear soon leaves the group divided			1
' why would you do that ? ' @entity82 asks			0
' would n't you want to save it for the memory ? ' ' oh , that is so stupid , ' @entity30 adds , however @entity64 notes that the feature is ' pretty neat '			0
and @entity128 quickly thinks of a group of people who would benefit from this app. ' all that sexting and texting and nude pictures and all that , politicians should get onto this thing , ' she notes			0
no thank you : @entity164 ( pictured ) is completely unimpressed with @entity2 , calling it ' stupid ' parental supervision : @entity123 ( pictured ) says she would never let her daughter have a cell phone during sleepovers at her house because of this app although @entity39 is not convinced that the pictures will completely disappear , explaining : ' nothing is gone forever - not on this stuff			1
' @entity30 remains unimpressed after she learns that there are ways for users to save the pictures against the sender 's wishes			0
' well , then what the heck are we talking about , ' she says with frustration			0
the elders then go on to discuss the controversy surrounding teens who are using the app to send inappropriate pictures			0
' do n't send the picture in the first place if it 's anything that is going to [ include ] your little naked a * * , ' @entity128 advises			0
and @entity123 says she would refuse to allow her daughter to have cell phones during sleepovers at her house			0
' no pictures of girls in their underwear are going to leave this house , ' she says .			0
