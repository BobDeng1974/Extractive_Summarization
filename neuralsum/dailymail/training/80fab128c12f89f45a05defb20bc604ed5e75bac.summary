@entity0 will start on pole position for sunday 's @entity2 after the stewards took no further action for an incident in qualifying that affected @entity8 team - mate @entity7			1
on pole position by just 0.059secs from @entity10 after the opening laps in the final qualifying period , @entity0 locked up on the entry to @entity14 on his second and final attempt , and was forced to take the escape road			1
behind the @entity17 , @entity7 was on a quicker lap , but with yellow flags being shown by the marshals due to @entity0 's incident , the championship leader had to abort a lap he has since claimed would have secured him pole			1
they would have accessed all telemetry and data from @entity0 's car , in particular with regard to the 28 - year - old 's braking point compared to his previous laps during qualifying			1
the @entity53 said a study of the data proved @entity0 had done nothing wrong			1
' the stewards examined video and telemetry data from the team and @entity53 and could find no evidence of any offence related to the turn 5 incident , ' the statement read			1
it was reminiscent of the infamous 2006 incident in @entity2 when seven - times champion @entity68 was found guilty by the stewards of deliberately crashing his @entity70 at @entity71			2
like @entity0 , @entity68 was on provisional pole that day , but behind him championship rival @entity73 in his @entity75 was quicker and poised to beat the @entity17 , but like @entity7 was forced to abort			1
it resulted in @entity68 's times being deleted , and subsequently he was demoted to the back of the grid			2
controversial : @entity0 was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in saturday 's qualifying session frosty : @entity7 was not amused after finishing behind his team - mate while @entity86 's @entity85 completes the top three in @entity88 the stewards did not find @entity0 guilty of any wrongdoing , and he retained the sixth pole of his career , and second in a row at @entity2 after he pipped @entity7 to top spot on the grid last year			1
whilst @entity0 was naturally delighted , punching the air as he stepped from the cockpit of his car , @entity7 had a face like thunder			1
it is yet more grist to the mill in the team battle that is unfolding between the pair this season , with just three points separating them in the championship standings			0
explaining the incident from his perspective , @entity0 said : ' no , it was not an ideal way to end qualifying			2
@entity113 : @entity0 will start from pole for sunday 's @entity2 after the stewards took no further action disappointing : @entity7 could only manage second place , and was denied his fifth consecutive pole ' i thought it was over , that the track would ramp up and someone else could beat my time			1
' i 'm happy it worked out			0
pole at home is obviously fantastic			2
it could n't be better			0
' as for the fact @entity7 was behind and was two tenths of a second quicker before having to back off , @entity0 added : ' of course i 'm sorry for @entity7			2
i did n't know where he was			0
' @entity7 , in response , was terse as he said : ' i do n't have an answer to that			2
' behind the duo will be the @entity86 pair of @entity85 and four - times champion @entity138 , finishing three tenths of a second and half - a - second down respectively on @entity0			1
struggle : @entity73 could n't generate pace in his @entity70 move over , @entity138 : @entity85 was quikcer than @entity86 team - mate @entity138 in @entity2 tense : @entity7 looks on as @entity85 shakes pole - sitter @entity0 's hand then come the @entity145 and @entity146 in fifth and sixth , with the latter an astonishing 1.4secs off the pace			1
@entity151 's @entity150 starts seventh ahead of a marvellous effort from rookies @entity154 for @entity156 and @entity157 in his @entity151 , with @entity159 's @entity158 10th			2
the stewards , though , face a busy post-qualifying period as there are three other investigations to be considered , with all those incidents taking place in the initial 18 - minute session			0
two concern a case of impeding , with @entity158 and @entity170 's @entity169 involved in one case , with the other involving @entity173 and pastor @entity174 in his @entity175			0
the final incident came towards the end , with @entity179 ' @entity178 opening the door through @entity14 for @entity181 in his @entity182 to drive through			0
the clumsy @entity183 , however , had too much power , running into the side of @entity178 and sending both into the barrier			0
with @entity188 already at the back of the grid in 22nd , the stewards need to look at an alternative penalty as a loss of grid places will be meaningless			0
as for @entity178 , although his time was good enough to get him into @entity198 , the @entity194 was unable to take part due to damage to his car and will unfortunately start 16th			0
ahead of him will be @entity159 's @entity204 in 11th , followed by @entity205 , comfortably out - qualified by team - mate @entity154			0
@entity179 ' @entity206 and @entity207 in his @entity175 line up 13th and 14th , with the latter followed by team - mate @entity174 and then @entity178			0
the @entity170 duo of @entity169 and @entity211 are on row nine in 17th and 18th , followed by @entity212 and @entity213 , with @entity182 team - mates @entity214 and @entity188 at the rear .			0
