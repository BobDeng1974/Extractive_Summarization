a drug costing up to £ 9million per patient is to be made available on the @entity5 - making it the health service 's most expensive medicine			1
@entity7 - also known as @entity7 - will be offered to about 200 people suffering from a rare kidney condition , the treatments watchdog confirmed last night			1
the @entity10 and excellence ( @entity12 ) said the drug – which will cost the @entity5 up to £ 82million a year – would allow patients to live independently for decades			1
a @entity12 spokeswoman confirmed last night that the drug would be the most expensive funded by the @entity5			1
sir @entity17 , left , of the @entity10 and excellence ( @entity12 ) , said he was pleased to have authorised the new ' wonder ' drug @entity7 , also known as @entity7 , to treat a rare kidney condition the drug will treat atypical @entity21 ( @entity22 ) - a life - threatening disease affecting around hundreds of people in @entity25			1
it causes inflammation of blood vessels and the formation of blood clots throughout the body			0
there are only around 200 sufferers , with 20 to 30 new patients with the condition diagnosed each year			1
currently there are about 56 patients receiving the drug through a temporary agreement with @entity25			2
patients are constantly at risk of sudden damage and failure of their vital organs , particularly the kidneys			2
@entity12 said the drug – which will be funded on an interim basis - was a ' significant innovation ' and offered ' gains of a magnitude that is rarely seen for any new drug treatment '			1
its chief executive sir @entity17 conceded the drug would prove to be ' very expensive ' and recommended @entity25 find ways of reducing the cost			2
the decision to provide @entity7 , developed and marketed by @entity57 firm @entity56 , was only approved on the basis of ultra-rare conditions , rather than being assessed on its standard value - for - money formula			1
atypical @entity21 ( @entity22 ) is a life - threatening disease affecting around 200 people in @entity25			1
it causes severe damage to the kidneys , pictured , leading to kidney failure in some patients the health watchdog said that it was unfair to apply the usual rules because it was such a rare condition – meaning drug companies had to recoup their research costs from only a handful of patients			1
with the drug offering an extra 25 years of good - quality life , @entity12 deemed it worth the annual £ 340,000 cost per patient to the @entity5			1
atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ( @entity22 ) is a rare , life - threatening , genetic disease			1
it causes damage to the vital organs , the kidneys , heart and brain in particular			0
although the condition does affect children , around a half of sufferers are adults			0
the condition affects the immune system and in sufferers			0
scientists believe an abnormality in proteins in the immune system causes cells along blood vessel walls to become damaged			0
platelets become overactive and blood clots form in tiny blood vessels throughout the body			0
clots can block the flow of blood , create inflammation and travel to other organs , causing further damage			0
@entity22 is caused by changes or mutations in the genes that produce proteins that help control the part of the body 's immune system			0
the changes cause that part of the immune system to attack the body doing great damage to vital organs if left untreated			0
symptoms of the condition include diarrhoea , nausea and vomitting , shortness of breath , fatigue , heart and kidney abnormalities			0
@entity22 causes damage to the kidneys , causing many sufferers to require long - term dialysis or a kidney transplant if their kidneys stop working			0
other complications include high blood pressure , around half of patients will experience neurological symptoms , four in 10 will suffer heart problems , while almost a third will have diarrhoea and other digestive problems			0
source : @entity146 but the decision will come as a blow to cancer patients after a quarter of treatments that can offer a few extra months of life were stopped on cost grounds this month			1
sir @entity17 said : ' @entity22 is a very distressing condition that imposes a significant burden both on those with the condition and their carers and families			0
' we are therefore pleased to be able to recommend @entity7 for funding			2
' @entity162 accepted that @entity7 is a step change in the management of @entity22 and can be considered a significant innovation for a disease with a high un-met clinical need			1
' he added : ' the drug is , however , very expensive			0
the @entity162 felt that the budget impact of @entity7 would be lower if the potential for adjusting the dose of the drug and stopping treatment was explored			2
' this is reflected in the guidance which recommends @entity7 should be funded only if important conditions are met , including the development of rules for starting and stopping treatment for clinical reasons			2
' in the meantime @entity25 and the company should consider what opportunities might exist to reduce the cost of @entity7 to the @entity5			1
' research has shown that @entity7 is an effective treatment , which can block the faulty part of the immune system , stopping it causing the cell damage			2
@entity191 said the drug has been ' proven to prevent kidney failure ' in patients with newly diagnosed @entity22			2
' without it , their kidneys would fail , and as there is no other effective treatment available , patients would have no choice but to start a gruelling dialysis routine to stay alive , ' a spokesman said			0
research funded by the charity at @entity206 has been central to understanding @entity22 and to finding an effective treatment for the disease			0
@entity209 , from @entity191 , said : ' we are thrilled with @entity12 's decision			2
' although there is a high cost attached to @entity7 , this treatment is life - changing for @entity22 patients and will help improve their quality of life dramatically			1
' we 're very proud that some of our research has played a role in understanding the disease			0

around 200 patients suffering from atypical @entity21
the drug @entity7 , known as @entity7 , allows them to live normally
@entity5 officials have said the £ 340,000 a year cost is value for money
each year 20 to 30 new patients are diagnosed with the rare disease
the drug offers patients an extra 25 years of good quality life
@entity12 recently *withdrew* authorisation for some cancer drugs over cost
