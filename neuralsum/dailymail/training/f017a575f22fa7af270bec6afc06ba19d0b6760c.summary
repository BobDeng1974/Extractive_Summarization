it ’s a grim reality when an estimated eight million people are travelling by aeroplane every day – the person sitting next to you could die at 30,000ft			0
it ’s the last thing you would expect to happen when you ’re jetting off on holiday , but every now and then reports surface in the media about a person who died of natural causes on a domestic or international flight			2
it begs the question , how are cabin crew supposed to respond – specifically , what do they do with the deceased person ’s body – so not to alarm other passengers , especially children , in such a sensitive situation when there is little available space on a plane ? flight attendants are trained to move a deceased passenger 's body to a private area or empty row travellers who have been on a plane where someone has died mid-flight have told stories about the deceased being moved to an empty row in first or business class cabins , while some aircraft which are used on long - haul journeys are equipped with special compartments to keep a body out of sight			1
some airlines equip their planes with body bags , just in case			2
@entity48 ’ fleet of @entity50 aircraft , which were used on all - business class flights to the @entity52 and are no longer in service , became the first to include a so - called ‘ corpse cupboard ’ , a discreet locker large enough to store an average - sized body			1
while a ‘ corpse cupboard ’ may sound extreme , staff are trained to move a deceased passenger out of view from other travellers			1
cabin crew receive first aid training , which is a mandatory part of maintaining their credentials but that is not always possible , depending on the number of passengers on board and the size of the plane			1
if there is no space , cabin crew are told to cover the person with a blanket up to their neck and tighten their safety belt			0
if a death occurs shortly after take - off it could result in a plane returning to its airport of departure , while unscheduled landings have occurred in rare cases where a passenger died in - flight			1
a recent @entity92 documentary , titled a very @entity94 airline , revealed how @entity95 trains its cabin crew to respond when a passenger dies			1
finding a private area or an empty seat for a deceased passenger 's body is not always possible new recruits were told they can not place a dead passenger in the loo because the passenger could slip off the seat and wind up on the floor			1
the trainer said : ‘ you would have to take the aircraft apart to get that person out			0
imagine putting someone in the aircraft toilet			0
’ a @entity95 spokesman told @entity115 : ‘ we expect our cabin crew to treat customers who have passed away with dignity and respect			0
‘ this usually involves trying to move the person to an available seat in the most private area possible			1
‘ our cabin crew will then focus their efforts on looking after any family , friends and travelling companions to give them privacy and support at an extremely stressful and upsetting time			0
’ cabin crew will try to find a doctor on board if there is a medical emergency or a passenger who is deceased but finding a possible area is not always possible on planes which are not configured with first or business classes			1
space is at a premium on flights offered by @entity144 , @entity145 ’s largest budget airline			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity148 - based carrier said its planes will make an unscheduled landing if it is a medical emergency			2
she said : ‘ all of our crews are trained in first aid			2
should an incident occur in flight which requires medical intervention , our crew will ascertain whether any medically trained individuals are on board and divert to the nearest suitable airport , requesting medical assistance to be on standby before landing			1
’ a spokesperson for @entity165 , @entity166 ’s national airline , said deaths on its planes are ‘ very rare ’			0
the spokesperson added : ‘ if a passenger passes away during flight , our cabin crew are trained to handle the situation with the utmost respect and dignity			1
’ if there are seats available , flight attendants will move the person 's body to the first or business class cabin @entity180 , a former commercial flight attendant who continues to fly for a private client , said an in - flight death is a ‘ terrible thing ’ for everyone on board			1
she told @entity115 : ‘ each person is going to handle it differently			0
that said , in my experience cabin crew are incredibly tenacious and resilient people who have incredible stamina for experiencing all sorts of crazy and upsetting events and being able to move through it , carry on , and ultimately be ok			2
’ in many cases , the plane continues to its destination			2
@entity180 added : ‘ it 's determined case by case and it really depends where in the world you are – and how will it impact the passengers			2
‘ for example , are you flying over the middle of the @entity209 ? a lot depends on where you are and where your destination is			0
‘ it may be most beneficial to continue to your destination because landing prematurely will cost the airline and passengers quite a lot of money and incur missed connections , fees , and more			2
’ last december a 23 - year - old woman from @entity220 died on a transatlantic flight from @entity222 to @entity223 , near @entity224			1
a doctor who was on board attended to the woman and tried to resuscitate her , but she was declared dead			0
the plane continued its journey and was met by police officers and a medical examiner when it landed in @entity223			0
a spokeswoman for @entity144 said its planes will make an unscheduled landing if it is a medical emergency in some cases , passengers are not allowed to disembark until authorities board the plane , inspect the body and conduct interviews			1
in 2007 , a woman in her 70s was moved to the first class cabin from economy after she died on a @entity95 flight from @entity246 to @entity247			1
one of the passengers was asleep and woke up to find cabin crew putting the woman in his row , where she was propped up using pillows in a seat next			1
for the next five hours , the women ’s body rested in a seat next to her grieving daughter and son - in - law			1
passenger @entity261 told @entity262 : ‘ she kept slipping under the seatbelt and moving about with the motion of the plane			0
when i asked what was going on i was shocked to hear she was dead			0
’ some passengers were questioned when the plane landed			0
airline employees are also trained to deal with deaths involving their colleagues			0
although incredibly rare , one such situation occurred in 2009 when a 60 - year - old @entity275 pilot died from a heart attack while flying from @entity277 to @entity223			0
two co-pilots safely landed the plane in @entity223 , and officials said the 247 passengers were not in danger .			0

flight attendants receive special training on how to respond to a death
in many cases a deceased passenger is moved to an empty seat
@entity48 had ' corpse cupboards ' on some long - haul routes
staff trained to move body out of view from other passengers
