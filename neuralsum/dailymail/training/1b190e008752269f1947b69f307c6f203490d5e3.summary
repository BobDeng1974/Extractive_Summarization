by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 17:10 est , 19 november 2012 police are on the hunt for a methodical serial killer responsible for at least three killings with the same .22 caliber handgun over the last four months			1
the .22 @entity7 's latest victim , a @entity9 boutique owner was shot to death in the head friday night with the same gun that killed two other shopkeepers in the same borough over the summer			2
ballistics tests matched in each killing , all of which occurred in @entity20 shops with an ' 8 ' in the address			0
suspect : following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun , police released this sketch of the suspect a sketch of the killer has been released after a witness told police he noticed a disturbed man at a previous victim 's store just before a body was discovered , muttering to himself about putting a bullet in someone 's head			1
he is said to be roughly 5 - foot - 5 and around 140 pounds			0
the @entity38 reports that the shop owner @entity39 of @entity40 was behind the counter of she she in @entity20 's @entity44 section when he was shot friday night			0
the gunman dragged the victim 's body toward the back of the store and covered it with clothing			0
murdered : @entity39 was killed with thre gunshots , but it seems nothing was stolen from his shot police found the 78 - year - old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso , @entity56 reported			1
on the floor of the shop were the killer 's calling card : shell casings matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides			1
' now it 's like he 's telling us , ' it 's me again , '' a police source told the @entity38			2
casings that police have matched to two other murders			1
“ now it ’s like he ’s telling us , ‘ it ’s me again , ’ ” a police source said			2
the way @entity39 's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings			0
on july 6 , @entity85 , 65 , was found shot through the neck in his @entity89 clothing shop			2
his body was also hidden			0
police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies			1
' i hope they catch the son of a b * * * * , ' @entity85 's son , @entity97 said			0
when @entity104 did n't come home at the usual time friday his family called the police , who discovered his body			2
it was n't not clear if the killer actually took anything , or if the murder was his sole motivation			2
' he never had in his whole life one enemy , he did n't have , he was a very kind man , ' his sobbing wife , @entity114 , told reporters			0
saturday he was supposed to be at his grandson ’s @entity118			0
victims : @entity121 and @entity85 were killed by the same handgun earlier this year police believe the murderer had been watching the store in preparation for the attack , noting that he 'd chosen a shop with no security cameras			1
@entity130 , 59 , was found dead in his @entity132 store at 1877 86th st. , was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck			0
besides owning stores , each victim was of @entity138 descent , prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated			1
it appeared nothing was taken from @entity39 's shop but both @entity143 and @entity85 had money taken from them , and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive			0
unguarded : believe the killer was attracted to the store because , as with previous crime scenes , there were no cameras @entity152 of the @entity153 of the @entity154 said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim 's description			1
' the only members that we would be concerned about are @entity138 , ' he said			2
it 's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology , as the address for each homicide includes the number 8 : @entity143 at 1877 86th st. , @entity85 at 7718 5th ave. , and @entity39 at 834 @entity172 none of the stores had working surveillance cameras			1
scene : police believe the killer may have been casing the shop , as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act neighbors called @entity104 a ' neighborhood staple			1
' ' he was a regular guy , ' said customer @entity185			0
' he never hurt nobody			0
' police are offering $ 12,000 for any information leading to the killer 's arrest and conviction .			1

casings from the same .22 caliber handgun found at all three crime scenes
killer may have chosen stores based on lack of surveillance cameras
all three victims are @entity138 , prompting fears of racial motivation
police offering $ 12,000 *reward* for information
