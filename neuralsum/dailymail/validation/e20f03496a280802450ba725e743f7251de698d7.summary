batsman @entity0 feels @entity1 need to make a convincing statement that they belong in the @entity4 quarter - finals when they meet @entity6 and @entity7 in their final two group games			1
@entity1 must win both matches , against lower - ranked opponents , to have any chance of reaching the knockout stage			1
an early exit looms large after sunday 's nine - wicket defeat to @entity15 in @entity16 followed wide - margin beatings by co-hosts @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity0 has insisted that @entity1 must succeed in securing convincing victories in their next two games @entity0 snicks a ball down fine leg during @entity1 's defeat by @entity15 in their previous @entity4 match that has piled the pressure on , albeit in two games @entity0 points out that @entity1 would have needed to win in any circumstance			1
' if you play those two games at the start of the competition you still have to win them , ' @entity0 said			1
' the way our schedule is , we have these games towards the end			2
if it was broken up a bit more it might look slightly different			2
' but it does n't take away from the fact that we want to win these two games convincingly			2
' @entity1 's hastened need to restore confidence is underlined by the fact that should they reach the last - eight they will now most likely play the highest - ranked team in @entity48 that will almost certainly be either @entity50 or world champions @entity52 , who @entity1 did beat twice during the tri-series leading up to the @entity4			1
' we do n't want to just scrape through - we want to put in some really good performances and put to bed some of the things we 've got wrong so far , ' @entity0 added			1
@entity1 captain @entity59 was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the @entity4 @entity62 and team - mate @entity63 shake hands with @entity59 after @entity15 's nine - wicket wi ' we know that if we get through to the quarter - finals we 'll be in a position where we have nothing to lose			1
' there will be sides coming up against us who could potentially be quite timid and think they should beat us and that could work in our favour			2
' by the time you get to that stage it 's crunch time and every side is under pressure ; not just us			0
hopefully we can get those wins and build some momentum			0
' @entity0 believes the gap between @entity1 and the best teams at the @entity4 is not as large as their heavy defeats would suggest			1
' i do n't think that 's fair , ' he said			0
' yes , we have been beaten heavily in those three games , but i do n't think that we are that far away from beating those sides			2
' if we get the best out of every individual and all play as well as we can then we are just as good as sides like that if not better			0
it 's about making sure , for the next two games especially , that we turn up and do everything we possibly can to put those performances in			0
' that 's got to come from the individuals to make sure they front up			0
not just the senior players ; not just exciting young players coming into the side			0
' @entity0 hit a career - best 121 from 108 balls against @entity15 but @entity1 's bowlers could n't match his exploits @entity106 and @entity107 show their disappointment after @entity1 's third loss of the tournament @entity0 stood up to be counted in the @entity15 defeat when the 24 - year - old became @entity1 's young @entity4 centurion			1
his career - best 121 from 108 balls inspired @entity1 to a formidable 309 for six - the second successive match they had passed 300 - only for the bowlers to lack any penetration as twin tons from @entity63 and @entity118 eased @entity15 to victory in 16 balls			1
' at the start of the day , if you 'd given us 310 we 'd have thought that a very good effort , ' @entity0 said			1
' whenever you get 310 on the board you are immediately putting sides under pressure to chase it			0
unfortunately we did n't create that pressure with the ball and we did n't do anything to make it difficult for them from 10 overs onwards			0
' the ease of @entity15 's chase suggested @entity1 did not set their sights high enough and , while @entity0 admitted more risks can be taken with the bat , they had left @entity15 with a record chase at the ground			1
' there was no feeling turning up to the game that 270 was a par score , ' he said			0
' we got out there , we played it as we saw it , there were periods when @entity15 bowled really well at us			1
we got 310 which , on that wicket , i felt was a good score			0
' in one - day cricket maybe we could have taken a few more risks , potentially we could have gone a bit earlier at them , be more aggressive earlier			2
but it 's a fine balance			0
if you then lose two wickets - on that wicket , we 'd done well to get to where we were			2
' unfortunately we could n't quite create the pressure with the ball that they did			0
we were n't disciplined enough and we leaked too many boundaries			0
