campaigners are desperate to find a herd for an orphaned @entity3 elephant who has spent most of her 39 years alone in zoos			1
@entity6 was just three years old when the rest of her herd was wiped out in 1978 , and she has since been moved from zoo to zoo across @entity11 , isolated and showing signs of distress			1
after stints in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , she has been at @entity19 's @entity18 in the city of the same name , in what campaigners say , has been a cramped enclosure surrounded by the sounds of building work			1
born into the wild , she would normally be a highly social animal and rights campaigners say she may not survive much longer after being starved of the company of her own kind for decades			1
activists say her enclosure in @entity19 was not ready when she arrived , and she had to be kept in a tiny cage until it was finished with the noise from the building work as a constant distraction			2
instead of being placed with other elephants after her family died , @entity6 was sold to the @entity60 zoo near @entity61 , south west @entity15 , where she remained isolated for around a quarter of a century			1
in 2004 @entity6 was moved to the @entity63 zoo in @entity64 , @entity16 , where she was temporarily placed with another female elephant , @entity65 , who also had a difficult past			1
the two quickly became inseparable			0
@entity67 : @entity70 the @entity3 elephant 's current enclosure is said to be woefully inadequate , with activists saying the stress of being in tight captivity and deprived of the company of other elephants is causing stress shocking : @entity6 is kept behind red metal bars in her fourth zoo to call home in the last 10 years mud bath : elephants are usually very sociable creatures with a deep understanding for other herd members but when the zoo got into financial difficulties she was again sold off , and in 2009 was taken to @entity89 zoo in @entity15 , whose herd did not accept her so she was moved in 2011 to @entity91 near @entity92 , @entity17 - where the same thing happened			1
finally she ended up where she is now , where campaigners say she has been for more than a year			2
@entity3 elephants can live for up to 60 or 70 years			2
@entity98 , one of the activists behind the campaign , said : ' elephants are highly sociable beings , with very strong ties to their families			0
losing her family and then being isolated must 've had a devastating effect on @entity70			0
' elephants are traditionally pack animals with close family ties but @entity6 lives all alone in the @entity19 zoo where her conditions are inappropriate to say the least			1
animal rights campaigner @entity98 said : ' she is showing signs of severe stress and has a damaged foot which is in need of treatment			0
she is seen swaying and rubbing her head against the side of the enclosure ' no friends : after years of isolation @entity121 may have forgotten how to socialise and was rejected later on ' she is showing signs of severe stress and has a damaged foot which is in need of treatment			0
she is often seen swaying from side to side and also seen rubbing her head against her enclosure which are both signs of distress in elephants			0
' the floor has no drainage , and @entity6 has to stay with her ill feet in her own urine and faeces			2
' she has had a life of misery and neglect , and to give her one last chance of some happiness at the end of days and after all she has gone through			0
' a reporter contacted the zoo over the allegations but the director was unavailable for comment			0
