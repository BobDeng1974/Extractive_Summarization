by @entity0 follow @ @ martin_domin @entity1 and @entity2 almost came to blows outside the ring on saturday night			1
the bitter rivals are on a collision course for a grudge rematch later this year after passing their second tests at cruiserweight with flying colours			1
and the pair traded verbal insults after @entity2 's victory before the @entity14 had to stop himself from clambering out of the ring to meet his aggressor			1
hostilities soon resumed , however , between the two men who first met in the ring in 2011			0
on that occasion , @entity1 retained his light - heavyweight world title with a majority decision			2
@entity2 , who earlier became the first man to stop @entity45 @entity44 , told @entity46 : ' we can do it [ the rematch ]			1
fighting talk : both @entity1 and @entity2 believe they will win their rematch fighting talk : cleverly gestures to @entity2 that he will beat him in their rematch lets get it on : @entity1 and @entity2 are due to fight later this year in either @entity58 , @entity14 or @entity59 ' i ai n't a 16 fight novice , i 'm an established pro who 's fought better pros than you in lesser fights			1
' you were a plastic world champion , we fought for a belt that should never have been a world title			0
' forget that defeat , i just want to hurt you			0
' @entity1 , who also earned himself an early night with a fourth - round stoppage of @entity71 , retorted : ' i 've already come to his home town once and beaten him and i 'll do it again			1
this time it will be emphatic			0
i 've already beat you and i 'll spank you again			0
' the rematch is expected to take place in october or november with @entity14 , @entity58 and @entity59 all in the running as venues			2
knock out blow : @entity2 sends @entity44 to the canvas to win his fight job done : @entity1 walks away after beating @entity71 @entity2 looked vulnerable at times before dispatching @entity24 with a chilling left hook in the fifth round			1
he added : ' i wanted rounds and i knew the guy had never been stopped			2
i wanted to set him up for the perfect shot and boy did i set him up			0
' @entity1 was always in control against @entity92 , an @entity93 who looked exhausted after the second round			1
he said : ' i 'm happy with that			0
i said all week that he 's a shorter opponent and he 'd come out swinging and that 's what he did			0
seen it all before : @entity1 and @entity2 had to be separated at a press conference back in 2011 ' bit by bit i broke him down			1
it was a case of taking a few to land a lot more and it was just a matter of time before i took him out			0
' that was the perfect fight for my second fight at cruiserweight			0
' it 's going to be fireworks with that guy from @entity14			2
' @entity2 , i 'm coming for you			2
