@entity0 , 26 , from @entity1 , awoke to her husband @entity2 , now 34 , molesting her			1
she reported him to the police and they confiscated his computer , where they found 300 films of @entity2 raping and abusing his wife as she slept a woman has spoken of her horror at discovering her husband had been secretly raping her while she slept and filming the attacks			1
@entity0 , from @entity1 , @entity14 , fought through panic attacks and depression to see her now - ex partner @entity2 put behind bars after the terrifying assaults which took place in the bedroom they shared			1
the 26 - year - old is now sharing her story in the hope that it will help other victims of abuse			0
@entity0 thought that she had the fairy - tale marriage when she met @entity2 in a pub when she was 18			1
although he was eight years her senior , the couple instantly hit it off and began a relationship			0
in 2009 , they completed their family when @entity0 fell pregnant with their daughter , who is now four years old			1
but gradually , @entity2 ’s behaviour became more and more controlling and he would tell @entity0 where she could be and how to behave with their child			1
despite some reservations about his personality , @entity0 agreed when her boyfriend proposed , thinking that marriage might iron out the problems in their relationship			2
so the couple married in 2011 at a local church in front of all of their family and friends			0
instead of strengthening their bond , @entity2 , now 34 and working in his father 's double glazing business , became more distant after the wedding			1
he refused to let his wife use his computer and would regularly shut himself away in their bedroom in the evening			2
she made the discovery one morning when she woke up to find @entity2 attacking her			2
as well as raping his wife , @entity2 would also film himself molesting her with various household objects			1
she told this morning : ‘ at the time i thought , i 'll just pretend i 'm still asleep and see what 's going on			0
‘ he stopped pretty quickly and i left the bedroom and went downstairs and sat up watching some rubbish on telly			0
’ on march 28 , 2014 , @entity2 attended @entity74 and pleaded guilty to five counts of rape , attempted rape , eight counts of assault by penetration , three of sexual assault and ten of making indecent images of children			2
he was sentenced to 12 years in prison after her husband left for work , she fled to her neighbour ’s house and told them what was going on			1
the neighbour convinced @entity0 to report her story to the police and officers came over immediately to take more details			1
because of the type of the assault , the police confiscated @entity2 ’s laptop , video recorder and @entity101			1
while helping officers with their search , @entity0 discovered seven external hard drives stashed under a piece of furniture in their bedroom and also handed those over to be examined			2
after accessing the hard drives and computer , @entity14 police found shocking images of hardcore pornography			1
she went with the officers to make an official statement at the local station and the following day they arrested @entity2 and charged him with charged with three counts of rape and two counts of assault by penetration			2
she told @entity123 : ‘ i was told they had found a bunch of videos showing @entity2 raping and abusing me			1
‘ the officer said they were quite disturbing and that i needed to come to the station for an examination and drug testing because of the nature of the assaults and that i appeared to be unconscious in the videos			0
’ @entity0 had her hair , blood and urine samples tested , but both her blood and urine tests came back from the lab negative and her hair sample was inconclusive			2
then a few months later , @entity0 was called back to the police station and asked to watch a few of the 300 recordings that @entity2 had amassed over the years of him molesting her			1
the officers asked her to look over the footage ahead of the court case against her husband			0
she told @entity148 that she was horrified by what she saw in the footage			0
@entity0 has decided to speak out in the hope that her story will help other victims of abuse to come forward she said : ‘ a couple of the videos i watched you could n't hear me be breathing and i did n't really appear to be moving at all			2
i did look like i was dead in some of them			0
‘ a lot of the videos were n’t just of him but of household objects and things he would decide to do with those , it was quite disturbing			0
’ one of the things that shocked her the most was that she had no idea that the abuse had been going on			0
she told @entity170 on the @entity172 programme she would occasionally wake up with a dead arm but there was nothing that had ever raised her suspicions until the morning that she woke up to find @entity2 molesting her			1
although the videos , which dated from january 2011 to december 2012 , were sickening to watch , they were what the police needed to prove that @entity2 was guilty of raping his wife			1
on march 28 , 2014 , @entity2 attended @entity74 and pleaded guilty to five counts of rape , attempted rape , eight counts of assault by penetration , three of sexual assault and ten of making indecent images of children			2
he was sentenced to 12 years in prison			1
since arrest , @entity0 has suffered from panic attacks and depression			0
but over the last few months , she has tried to come to terms with the abuse and move on with her life			0
she has divorced @entity2 and is now in a loving relationship with the neighbour who supported her after the attack and encouraged her to call the police			1
she has decided to speak out in the hope that her story will help other victims of abuse to come forward			0
she told this morning : ‘ if in any way you 're being abused you should tell someone - even if it 's just mentally - whatever kind of abuse it is			0
‘ and especially if people are secretive			0
it might be nothing but it might also be something quite big			0
