' this is a sad case for all those involved , ' @entity53 district attorney @entity52 told the @entity56 , adding that while the church 's and @entity12 's intentions were not necessarily harmful , ' they in essence terrorized several children			1

they said , ` just do as i say , and you wo n't be hurt			0
' ’ the girl said she and about 17 other teens were taken to the pastor 's house , where it appeared he was being assaulted , covered in what looked to be blood			1
kidnapped : the teens were shoved into these church vans and driven to the pastor 's house learning exercise : pastor @entity105 said the staged abduction was meant to show them what sort of persecution @entity109 face in other parts of the world eventually , she said , the adults in charge revealed it was a staged event , telling the traumatized teenagers that @entity109 in other countries battle with realities like that every day			1
one of the two ‘ kidnappers ’ was an off - duty police officer who was carrying a real gun , according to abc27.com			1

" ' - @entity40 , 14 - year - old victim of raid @entity9 of @entity26 ’s pastor , @entity105 , told the @entity56 in march that the church is ' so saddened ' that the girl was traumatized at the youth meeting			1
but he said his intent was never harmful – instead , it was designed to prepare them for what they might encounter as missionaries			2
@entity105 did n't disclose the names of those involved but said the mock kidnappers included an off - duty police officer and a retired @entity163 captain			1
' it was a youth event , to illustrate what others have encountered on a regular basis , ' he said , adding that the focus of the lesson was ' the persecuted church ' in other countries			1

@entity105 said the church has conducted similar events at least twice before , adding that ' there was much thought given to the safety aspect			2
' ' if anyone was ever uncomfortable , they would be removed ' from the exercise , @entity105 said , though part of the idea was to shock the students with the experience			0
in the future : @entity105 says : ' i would find a way that we could continue to keep the shock value , ' he said , ' but i would find a way to inform the parents ( beforehand ) ' @entity206 police chief @entity204 declined to comment until an investigation into the raid is complete			0
the names of the mother and daughter who complained have n't been made public			0

one security expert told the @entity56 that role - playing training is sometimes conducted ' at the quasi-military level ' for groups that are going to work in war zones			2
@entity224 , chairman of business intelligence and investigations at @entity227 , a worldwide risk consulting company with headquarters in @entity230 , said the idea of conflict zone training ' is to acclimate someone to a possible situation that might arise			0
' the training might involve everything from what items they should take to the country to a review of who they 're meeting and security conditions there , he said			0
@entity246 , who studies international affairs and terrorism at @entity249 , a @entity250 school that emphasizes a ' @entity109 worldview , ' questioned the wisdom of submitting a youth group to a mock kidnapping			1
' it just seems inappropriate for that age group			0
you would think there would be permission from the parents , ' @entity246 said , adding that he 's never heard of anything like that happening at a church			2
he said that while there have been highly publicized episodes of violence directed against @entity109 missionaries in other countries , it seems those countries ' local religious groups are more at risk			1
@entity105 said members of the church have made numerous mission trips overseas and have learned to be cautious			0
he said they were planning a trip to @entity278 but reviewed current news and advisories and decided it was unsafe			0
@entity105 said he ' would love to ' apologize to the girl and her mother but feels he ca n't until the police investigation is done			0
