by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 suggests gay men take antiretroviral aids drugs to protect themselves from infection , alongside condoms gay men , prostitutes , and prisoners have stubbornly high rates of @entity12 and are threatening progress in the global @entity15 battle , according to the @entity2 ( @entity2 )			1
for the first time , the organisation is ‘ strongly recommending ’ gay men consider taking antiretroviral aids drugs as an extra way of protecting themselves against infection , alongside using condoms			1
such an approach , known as pre-exposure prophylaxis or @entity26 , is a way for at - risk people to protect themselves by taking a single pill			1
this is usually as a combination of two antiretrovirals , taken every day			0
‘ globally we are failing certain populations that have the greatest risk yet we know have universally poorer access to health services , ’ said @entity33 , director of the @entity2 's department			0
‘ these are men who have sex with men , sex workers , transgender persons , specifically transgender women , persons who inject drugs and persons who are in prisons or other closed settings			0
’ @entity15 experts estimate that globally , @entity12 incidence among gay men could be cut by 20 to 25 per cent through @entity26 - averting up to one million new infections in this group over 10 years			1
@entity26 , when taken consistently , has also been shown to cut the risk of hiv infection in high - risk people by up to 92 percent			1
‘ the reason we are adding this to our prevention choices for men who have sex with men is that we have these very worrying increases in @entity12 incidence , ’ added @entity59 , coordinator of the @entity2 's department for @entity15			1
the @entity2 said studies estimate female sex workers are 14 times more likely to have hiv than other women , gay men are 19 times more likely to have @entity12 than the general population , and transgender women are almost 50 times more likely than other adults to have @entity12			1
the approach is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis or @entity26 , and experts estimate @entity26 could cut incidence of @entity12 in gay men by 20 to 25 %			1
@entity26 , when taken consistently , has also been shown to cut the risk of hiv infection in high - risk people by up to 92 per cent			1
stock image of a @entity12 test is pictured for injecting drug users , the risks of hiv infection can be 50 times higher than the general population			2
these people are most at risk of becoming infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes @entity15 , yet are least likely to get @entity12 prevention , testing and treatment services , the @entity91 - based @entity90 health agency said			1
a @entity99 girl born with the @entity15 virus and in remission for years , despite stopping treatment , is now showing signs that she still harbors @entity12			2
the news is a setback to hopes that very early treatment with powerful @entity12 drugs might reverse an infection that has seemed permanent once it takes hold			2
the girl is now nearly four years old			0
as recently as march , doctors said she seemed free of @entity12 despite not having been on aids drugs for about two years			0
that was a medical first			0
but on thursday , doctors said tests showed that she is no longer in remission			0
she is now back on treatment and is responding well , the doctors added			0
‘ we are seeing exploding epidemics in some of these key populations , ’ @entity33 said - adding these groups account for up to 50 per cent of new cases of hiv infection			2
some 35.3 million people worldwide are infected with @entity12 , but the rising number of patients reflects great strides in recent years in developing sophisticated hiv tests and combination @entity15 drugs and getting them to many of those who need them to stay alive			1
as a result , the annual @entity15 death toll is falling , dropping to 1.6 million people in 2012 from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005			0
new hiv infections are also steadily declining , and dropped by a third in 2013 from 2011			0
yet figures show the key high risk populations continue to have high infection rates , and appear to be hard - to - reach in terms of getting the right prevention messages , or getting them the testing and treatment health services they need			1
@entity33 continued that in many countries , gay men , sex workers and other marginalised groups are left out of national @entity12 plans and excluded by discriminatory laws and policies			2
‘ none of these people live in isolation , ’ he warned			0
‘ sex workers and their clients have husbands , wives and partners			0
failure to provide services to the people who are at greatest risk of @entity12 jeopardises further progress against the global epidemic			2
’ the @entity2 report , released ahead of the @entity174 in @entity175 , @entity176 on 20 july , said that by the end of 2013 , around 13 million people worldwide were taking @entity15 drug treatment			2
this has led to a 20 per cent drop in hiv - related deaths between 2009 and 2012 , it said .			0
