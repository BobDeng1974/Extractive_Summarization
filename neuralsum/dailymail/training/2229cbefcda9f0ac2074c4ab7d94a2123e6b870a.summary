@entity2 's family also said that they would be ordering a second autopsy as they do not trust the @entity78 government rulings , fearing that his death during a gun battle with police was part of a conspiracy			2
medical examiners only ever release suspects bodies after they have determined the cause of death , but that verdict has not been publicly disclosed yet			0
years before he allegedly opened fire on police alongside his younger brother @entity93 as they were on the run from authorities , the first apparent victim of his abuse was his girlfriend			2
@entity60 , 25 , accused him of slapping her on july 28 , 2009 during an argument over another woman - presumably @entity98 , whom he met at a club that year and went on to marry in 2010 - at his home in @entity102			2
at around the time they were dating , @entity2 posed for a series of photos in a boxing ring , and ms @entity60 was identified by the @entity59 as being the blonde seen wrapping his gloves in one of the pictures			0
ms @entity60 was ' crying hysterically ' and called 911 to report that she was ' beat up by her boyfriend ' , @entity102 police officer @entity112 wrote in the arrest report			0
doing his duty : @entity41 , the funeral director and owner of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , said that he ca n't help what @entity2 did but ' in this country , we bury the dead ' a vehicle believed to be carrying the body of @entity3 bombing suspect @entity2 backs into an underground garage at the @entity127 outraged : @entity128 , right , holds a sign and @entity130 , left , wears a ' @entity132 ' shirt as they stand outside the @entity127 he admitted to slapping her and was arrested on charges of assault and battery , the complaint said			1
the charges were dismissed before trial			0
around 11 months after the alleged slapping incident , @entity2 , 26 , married his wife , @entity98			1
ms @entity98 is now the one gaining the attention of police as they are trying to determine what role , if any , she played in helping plan , execute or cover up the attacks on april 15			0
though she was initially helpful , agreeing to be interviewed for hours and giving a dna sample to test against a trace of female dna found on one of the bombs , she has reportedly stopped cooperating with authorities			1
the @entity155 cites federal sources who say that they are ' skeptical ' about her prior claims to have had nothing to do with the bombings considering that she is not cooperating			0
other relatives of the bomber confirmed that they would be arranging a funeral for the 26 - year - old and that his body would remain in the @entity78 and not be sent back to @entity167			2
' of course , family members will take possession of the body , ' his uncle @entity168 said			0
' we 'll do it			0
a family is a family			0
' the move outraged @entity66 residents , whose lives were terrorized for the week after the bombing as local , state and federal officials searched for @entity2 and @entity93			1
what is she hiding ? @entity98 , the widow of @entity185 , reportedly stopped cooperating with police fellow convictions : both @entity2 's wife @entity98 ( left ) and his mother @entity189 ( right ) have prior shoplifting convictions , @entity191 's in 2007 and his mother 's in 2012 the only ones who have received some sliver of good news in the past few days were the relatives of the three victims who died in the blasts at the marathon finish line			1
a lawyer overseeing the fund dedicated to the victims announced that the families of the three who died could receive more than $ 1million in compensation			1
not only that , each of the people who lost a limb in the attack could expect to receive close to $ 1million as well			2
the final number of people who lost a limb - some of whom lost more than one - has not been tallied but it could be upwards of 20 people .			0
