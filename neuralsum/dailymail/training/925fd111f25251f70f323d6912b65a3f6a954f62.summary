it was the summer of 2011 and @entity1 had launched an aggressive , expensive revolution of their playing squad			0
with @entity4 having arrived for £ 35million in january that year , along with £ 23million @entity5 , @entity6 was determined to bring in more quality and give @entity1 the options and depth they had been lacking			2
so in came @entity10 ( £ 9million from @entity11 ) ; @entity12 ( £ 20million from @entity13 ) was the main priority to provide service from the flanks , while @entity17 ( £ 7million from @entity18 ) and @entity19 ( £ 7million from @entity20 ) came in to bolster the defence			1
@entity22 arrived at @entity1 for £ 16m along with new signings @entity10 and @entity12 @entity22 was a talented youngster at @entity24 but many thought he was not ready for the step up @entity22 at his first press conference , the midfielder found it tough at first but is now vice-captain among all those transactions , however , one stood out			1
the decision to recruit a young midfielder from @entity24 for £ 16million left many wondering whether @entity1 had been spending lavishly for the sake of it			1
£ 16million for @entity22 , they asked			1
really ? look at him now			0
of the group that arrived in 2011 , @entity22 is the only one who is a regular for @entity1 – @entity17 is still at the club but his long - term prospects are hardly bright – and there are no longer questions about whether he is worth £ 16million			1
quite the opposite , in fact			0
@entity22 ’s progress since he has been at @entity47 is a prime example of what determination , hard work and a refusal to give up can achieve and @entity53 ’ decision to make him vice-captain is his latest reward			1
@entity53 ' decision to make @entity22 second in command to @entity59 was an easy one @entity22 has countless amounts of energy and is a mainstay in a successful team had @entity22 wanted the easy life , he could have chosen to take up an offer from @entity66 in august 2012 , when they asked about his availability during negotiations with @entity1 over @entity69			1
he could have walked away from @entity70 and disappeared out of view			0
that , though , is not his style			0
@entity53 was delighted when @entity22 told him he wanted to stay and fight and in the past two seasons he has grown from someone who could not hold down a place in @entity1 ’s starting line - up to become one of the first names selected for club and country			1
‘ the first summer i came here , @entity22 had the opportunity to leave , ’ @entity53 recalled			1
‘ we were talking about it the other day			0
i did not push him out or ask him to go			0
but , like i do with all the players if a club comes in , i present them with the opportunity they may have			0
i said “ listen , you have a chance to go to @entity66 and you can go and play every week , or you can stay here			1
i ca n’t guarantee you a game straight away , but i know one thing for sure , i will improve you as a player			0
” he wanted to stay			0
‘ i felt that first period being out of the team helped him tactically as we could work on video and analyse his game			2
from that he has grown in confidence			0
you see now for club and country he holds himself really well , he ’s got a great stature and i think he will be around here for years to come			0
’ @entity53 offered @entity22 the chance to join @entity66 when he first arrived , but he declined @entity22 and @entity1 captain @entity59 share a joke with @entity53 at @entity111 it is why @entity53 decided late last week to make him @entity59 ’s deputy following @entity115 ’s return to @entity116			1
@entity22 is not the finished article yet but he is progressing at a rapid pace and there is no down he will be a long - term influence for @entity1			2
‘ his attitude when i was at @entity1 was tremendous from day one , ’ @entity122 recently recalled			0
‘ he looked at what @entity59 and @entity124 were doing , how they behaved , what they did in training i ’m not surprised he ’s doing well to be honest			0
with @entity22 it was just a question of time			1
’ his relentless energy , his strength and running power are vital components in this @entity1 team and it did not gone unnoticed how much of a difference his absence made when he was suspended for three games towards the end of last season			2
@entity22 has been ' watching what @entity59 and @entity124 have been doing ' @entity22 and @entity59 celebrate the latter 's goal from the penalty spot against @entity146 this season that @entity22 ’s absence was lamented then showed where he has elevated himself to			1
the young man who was deemed to represent some of former director of football @entity122 ’s excess is now likely to become a @entity1 stalwart			2
put it another way : if they were now looking to buy an @entity157 midfielder , who was 24 with a history of being constantly fit and available for games and can pop up with goals , £ 16million would n’t come close to it			2
looking back now , the fee @entity1 paid for @entity22 actually appears to be a bargain .			2

@entity22 arrived at same time as @entity10 and @entity12
young @entity24 midfielder cost £ 16m and many thought it was an error
but he is now a mainstay in the team with his *bundling* energy and drive
also nailed down a midfield spot for @entity176 under @entity177
@entity53 offered him chance to join @entity66 in 2012
manager has now given him vice-captaincy role
