by @entity0 it is among the most charming sights to be found in a @entity4 summer garden — birds fluttering down onto a bird bath			1
but who can really say they ’ve ever had clear sight of a robin having a rinse , a woodpecker washing or a blue tit mid-dip ? after all , it ’s all over in seconds so the best most of us can hope for with the naked eye is just a glimpse of a blurry splash			0

mirror image : a robin takes a cautious look around before entering the bath for a wash a quick flutter : in lightning - fast movements , a mistle thrush flaps its wings to spray water on its back flying visit : a young great spotted woodpecker complete with its red crown splashing out : this young blue tit looks rather apprehensive as it tries bathing for the first time tweet of the day : a blackbird shakes his feathers to create a remarkable fountain of droplets local colour : the beautiful yellow and red plumage of a goldfinch stands out in sharp relief causing a ripple : a siskin , with its vivid yellow - green feathers , takes a drink window on an avian world : the hidden camera trained on the bird bath ( right ) twitch and you 'll miss it : @entity21 waits patiently for the next visitor ‘ you just press the shutter and hope , ’ said mr @entity21 yesterday			1
‘ the action is so fast you can not tell whether you ’re going to get a good shot until you see the image			0
‘ every time , you think you are going to get something better than you got before			0
it just gets you hooked			0
’ he can take only one picture every ten seconds , so patience is essential because the camera needs time to reset			2
mr @entity21 , 81 , who hides behind a screen in his dining room to mask him from the birds ’ view while he snaps away through a gap , said : ‘ when they bathe , they shake their head in the water , throw water on their back and then flutter their wings			1
' i like to watch young birds trying to bathe for the first time because they are never quite sure what they should do			0
they jump in and panic , before taking off			0
' mr @entity21 , who runs a specialist animal photography business called @entity106 , said : ‘ when i started , i wanted to photograph animals in action , which required specialist flash equipment to freeze the motion of the subject			1
‘ you could n’t do that with the normal equipment that was out there , so i designed and built some myself			2
