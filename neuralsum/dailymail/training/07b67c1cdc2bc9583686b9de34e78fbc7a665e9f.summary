researchers have revealed an unprecedented insight into @entity2 , a two million - year - old human ancestor			1
the fossils , which were studied by scientists across the world , show a mixture of primitive features and of more advanced features typical of later human species			2
they analysed bones of sediba discovered near @entity14 in 2008 to find out how he walked , chewed and moved			0
for comparison , there is a small - bodied female modern human on the left and a male chimpanzee on the right the human ancestor has a narrow upper rib cage while the modern human 's thorax is uniformly cylindrical			1
the cone - shaped rib cage allowed the early hominin to move its shoulder blades so it could climb trees			1
however , it prevented it from swinging its arms meaning that walking and running was much more difficult			1
it had a slim waist similar to modern humans but feet which turned sharply inwards			1
@entity2 had the same number of lumbar vertebrae as a modern man and a similar curvature of the lower back			1
however , its back was longer and more flexible than that of modern humans			1
as a result , it is believed that this new species is currently the best candidate for a direct ancestor of our own species			1
the human ancestor had a narrow upper rib cage which is similar to that of large apes , such as gorillas , but which is different to the human thorax which is uniformly cylindrical			2
the researchers believe that it is the narrow upper thorax of apes that enables them to move their shoulder blades so that they can climb trees , however , it prevents them swinging their arms which makes walking upright much more difficult			1
therefore , dr @entity69 , of the @entity70 , assumes that @entity19			0
@entity2 was not able to walk or run on both feet as well as humans can			1
‘ they probably could n't run over longer distances , especially as they were unable to swing their arms which saves energy , ’ he said			0
while the lower thorax was less well preserved , it appeared to show that the early human had a slim waist similar to that of a modern human			2

sediba - the fossils of which were found near @entity14 in @entity89 an examination of the lower extremities also revealed a heel , metatarsus , knee , hips and back , which are unique and unprecedented			1
it suggested that @entity2 walked with feet turned sharply inwards			2
the teeth of this species were also studied and indicate that it is also a close relative of the previously identified @entity102			0
both of these species are more closely related to humans than other australopiths from east @entity89 , according to the new research			1
the study , published in the journal @entity110 , also revealed that both africanus and sediba shared about the same number of dental traits with the first undeniably human species			2

sediba at the @entity117 ‘ our study provides further evidence that @entity2 is indeed a very close relative of early humans , but we ca n't definitively determine its position relative to africanus , ’ said dr @entity124 , co-author of the study and professor of anthropology at the @entity128			1
the researchers examined the teeth from sediba and compared them to eight other @entity140 hominin species , which include modern humans from @entity89 , and extinct species of @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145			1
in all , the researchers examined more than 340 fossils and 4,571 recent specimens			2
they also examined teeth from 44 gorillas for comparison			0
the focus was on 22 separate traits of tooth crowns and roots that can give clues as to the relationship between the different species studied			0

@entity2 based on fossils found in @entity89 researchers use standardised measurements from the @entity168 to compare the teeth on these 22 traits			1
the researchers found that on 15 of these traits , sediba and africanus scored the same			2
@entity2 shared 13 traits with @entity175 , an early human species , which was comparable to how africanus scored			2
@entity2 and @entity177 shared five dental traits that were not found in earlier australopiths , further showing their close relationship			1
both also share five traits with early humans – homo habilis / rudolfenis and @entity175 -- which were not shared with earlier ancestors , demonstrating the close relationship between these two australopiths and the first humans			0
dr @entity124 said their dental analysis showed that both africanus and sediba are more closely related to humans than the famous ‘ @entity197 ’ skeleton fossil found in @entity196 in 1974			2
this fossil represented a species , @entity199 , that was at one time was thought to be the closest relative of humans			2
@entity203 shows the parts of the skeletons which have been studied to reveal the new findings the reconstructed skull and mandible of @entity2 @entity197 is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago			1
@entity2 lived 1.977 million years ago , while @entity177 lived between 3.03 and 2.04 million years ago			1
‘ our research on teeth ca n't definitively settle if either sediba or africanus is more closely related to humans than the other species , ’ dr @entity124 said			0
‘ but our findings do suggest that both are closely related to each other and are more closely related to humans than afarensis			0
‘ we need to find more sediba remains to help fill in the missing pieces of this evolutionary puzzle			0
’ an analysis of the cervical , thoracic , lumbar and sacral region of the spinal column was also carried out and shows that @entity19			0
@entity2 had the same number of lumbar vertebrae as modern man			1
the strong hollow back suggests that he was more advanced in this area than @entity19			0
@entity177 and may be more likely compared with @entity175			0
@entity2 had a human - like curvature of the lower back , but it was functionally longer and more flexible than that of modern humans			1
‘ they probably walked in a way that we might find strange — a ‘ compromise ’ form of bipedalism indicative of a hominin that still partially relied on climbing trees , ’ dr @entity241 explained			1

’ ‘ the bony spine of @entity19			0
sediba likely had the same number of vertebrae as that of modern humans , ’ dr @entity241 added			1
‘ however , it differed in one primary aspect of its configuration — the transition in inter-vertebral articular facets occurred at a higher level of the spine that than normally occurs in modern humans			1
in combination with other features , a functionally longer lower back would have allowed for a more flexible spine in @entity19			0
sediba relative to that of modern humans			1
’ in addition , morphological indicators of strong lumbar curvature suggest that @entity19			0
@entity2 evolved in this regard relative to @entity19			2
@entity177 , which lived between 3.03 and 2.04 million years ago , and closer to the more recent @entity291 homo erectus skeleton — to date , the most complete early human skeleton discovered			0
the new study shows an image of a human species with a mosaic - like physique			2
some body parts are similar to those of earlier and others to those of later hominins			0
‘ the numerous similarities with @entity175 suggest that @entity19			0
sediba represents the most appropriate early form of the genus @entity143 , ’ said dr @entity69			0
he added : ‘ the previous candidates are too fragmentary to be capable of occupying this position			0
’ the newly described human ancestor is thought to be more closely related to humans than the famous ' @entity197 ' skeleton fossil found in @entity196 in 1974			1
the image shows a 3d model of ' @entity197 '			0

biggest - ever study of the two million - year - old fossils found in @entity89
@entity2 is thought to be the most direct ancestor of modern humans
was *adapted* for climbing trees but not for *efficient* walking or running
