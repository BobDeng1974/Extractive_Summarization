by @entity1 reporter published : 22:49 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 10:53 est , 26 april 2012 if a picture is worth a thousand words , then how much is a camera worth that produces descriptions along with images ? rather than looking at an image and deciding what you see , a new prototype camera will actually describe to you the scene in several words , printing it out on a small piece of paper			1
the @entity16 , created by @entity17 , has all of the features of a normal camera and will capture any image in front of it - with the textual description as an added bonus			1
what you get is what you see : the descriptions are outsourced by @entity29 , and take around six minutes to come back with a description snapshot : the @entity16 , a prototype , produces short descriptions of every image captured the camera will then produce a textual account of the scene , often in a dozen words or less , via low - cost outsourcing			1
mr @entity17 , a self - proclaimed techie , describes on his blog how the fascinating technology works			2
like any other camera , the @entity16 captures metadata after the shutter is pressed , including when the photo was taken , the time , and the camera ’s settings			2
mr @entity17 ’s design goes one step further			0
by using @entity29 , an outsourcing system where users can pay others to process data types for a nominal fee , the camera uses old - fashioned man power to describe the scene			1
the descriptions allow better cataloguing of digital images , and can range from highly descriptive , to fairly minimal			1
one @entity62 picture of a city building reads : ‘ this is a faded picture of a dilapidated building			0
it seems to be run down and in need of repairs			0
’ in so many words : the @entity62 picture of a city building reads : ' this is a faded picture of a dilapidated building			0
it seems to be run down and in need of repairs ' how it works : the camera has a usb webcam and a thermal printer inside , and is hooked via ethernet and a five - volt plug the concept stemmed from the overwhelming amount of digital images without automatic forms of captioning			1
mr @entity17 writes : ‘ imagine if descriptive metadata about each photo could be appended to the image on the fly			0
’ he noted that as it stands , it is difficult to individually caption or search hundreds upon hundreds of family photos and that the @entity16 , though a prototype , shows promise that this technology may one day become reality			0
the camera uses a usb webcam and also has a thermal printer embedded in it , sending its data to @entity29 via @entity78			1
the standing cost of any one given description is $ 1.25 , with an average response time of six minutes – but mr @entity17 notes that the fastest responses come in as little as three minutes			2
however , the prototype is not portable , and runs off of an external five - volt source			0
mr @entity17 's past inventions include a hacked tv remote that can be programed to mute the television whenever a selected word is spoken , as well as creating a @entity113 pedal .			0

camera uses @entity29 system to ' describe ' what it ' sees '
' @entity29 ' sends images to staff who write brief description
prints out brief written descriptions using written info and camera data
