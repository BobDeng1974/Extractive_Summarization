by @entity0 for @entity1 you would think the point of a ‘ race ’ is to try to come first			1
but not if you ’re entering this year ’s ‘ four - legged ’ and wheelbarrow events at a @entity7 village carnival - which have been hit by health and safety edicts			1
the four - legged race through the village of @entity12 - which sees teams of three competitors tying a leg to each other - has traditionally involved pit - stops at four pubs			1
changes to the @entity20 means that competitors in the races are not allowed alcoholic refreshments but this year those trying to win the race will have to go teetotal if - according to police - they do n’t want to fall foul of the @entity20 , which bans the drinking of alcohol ‘ at speed ’			1
the organisers of thursday ’s event have decided that they are going to stay in line with the law to avoid the risk of prosecution , so competitors will have to stick to water or a soft drink			1
those entering the wheelbarrow race the following thursday will have to obey the same restrictions as they pass by the four pubs			2
but entrants for both events will be able to stop for as many drinks as they want , downed at whatever speed they wish , if they pledge to complete the course very slowly			2
‘ the races have been going for 33 years and we ’ve only had one person fall out of a wheelbarrow which is n’t bad going , ' said a local councillor the snail ’s pace events will start five minutes after the teetotal races			0
the drinking ban has angered some residents in the close - knit community where the two - week - long carnival has been going on for generations without any trouble			2
@entity62 , a @entity7 councillor and landlord of the village ’s @entity66 pub , said “ it ’s all to do with health and safety which i do n’t always agree with			0
‘ we live in a nanny state and it ’s the minority that the rules are in place for and the majority are the ones that have to pay			0
‘ the races have been going for 33 years and we ’ve only had one person fall out of a wheelbarrow which is n’t bad going			0
” organisers said on their website that the new rules had been drawn up for this year ’s races following a meeting with @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
we 're only here for the beer : organisers said on their website that the new rules had been drawn up for this year ’s races following a meeting with @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 the new stance has taken its lead from changes in 2009 to the @entity95 which bans ‘ irresponsible promotions ’			1
in particular , they bar ‘ any game or activity characterised by the consumption of alcohol at speed or within a prescribed time limit ’			1
the regulations are aimed at discouraging promotions such as those involving downing ‘ shots ’ in club or pub contests			2
but the carnival race organisers were worried that with competitors charging along the streets , stopping frequently to down booze as onlookers cheered them on , he event could lay itself open to contravening the new laws			0
entrants for both events will be able to stop for as many drinks as they want , downed at whatever speed they wish , if they pledge to complete the course very slowly organiser @entity122 said ‘ it ’s been a bit of a nightmare but we ’ll just have to see how things go			1
‘ the changes have been coming in slowly of a period of years and we ’ve just had to make this change to comply with the law			0
where are you all coming from ? we know where they are not going ... to the pub , at least nor during the races ‘ we wo n’t know how it will affect entries until the day , but people have been talking about it , so hopefully everyone will still get into the spirit of things			0
’ @entity7 police sergeant @entity146 said ‘ the races in the last few years have been extremely well run and there have been little , if any , problems			2
‘ the new rules are there simply to comply with new licensing laws and obviously we support that and the organisers have been very flexible in accommodating the changes			0
