by @entity0 first it 's the sweeping black lines , then you notice the eye - like dots , then the distinctive mustache , and then the whole combo comes together to make this creepy - crawly even creepier			0
a photographer in @entity9 was speechless after he spotted the face of @entity11 on the back of a common stink bug			1
the snapper was getting some pictures of the local wildlife in his back garden when he spotted the bug had an incredibly peculiar pattern resembling the @entity21 ex-dictator			1
the @entity11 bug ( left ) with its sweeping hairline and tiny mustache and @entity11 ( right ) with all the same qualities @entity26 , 29 , from @entity27 , @entity9 noticed almost straight away that the markings on the insect 's back resembled the hair line and tiny mustache that made @entity21 leader 's face so recognisable			1
he kept trying to get the bugs best side , but was unable to capture it 's most f√ºhrer - like pose because it kept running away			0
he said : ' i was clicking away at butterflies in our garden and suddenly i spotted the bug running on soil			2
' it had what i thought was a mask kind of pattern on its body which drew my attention			0
the photographer was left speechless when he spotted the spitting image of @entity11 on the back of an insect , immediately changing his focus from his garden 's butterflies to the dictator insect ( @entity65 ) the contrasting pattern of the stink bug is to ward off attackers ( right ) @entity26 , 29 , the photographer that captured the visage of the @entity11 bug ' it looked like @entity11 because of the distinct moustache pattern			1
' i was n't able to get too many shots because it was running but from what i got all my friends were curious and thought it looked like his face			0
' but this bug is just another in a long series of animals , and everyday objects , that look like the infamous dictator			1
in 2011 , @entity85 introduced the public to the ' @entity11 house ' , a building in @entity89 that had an unfortunate resemblance to @entity11 with a sweeping roof and thin , dark door underneath two windows			1
after this , @entity85 started receiving pictures of animals that looked like the dictator in droves			0
@entity100 , the pub mog from @entity98 in @entity99 was one of those animals			0
named ' @entity103 ' because of it 's unfortunate smattering of facial hair , the cat also sports a dark black barnet , making her look more like the infamous @entity21 leader than a simple cat with a mustache			2
patrons at the @entity112 also pointed out the distinction , making sure that the landlady , @entity114 , knew it ! tash the cat , know to locals as @entity11 , is the pub cat of the @entity112 in @entity118 in @entity99 ( @entity65 ) the ex-dictator , who now seems to be featured mainly as the focus of look - a - likes with animals and buildings , ( right ) @entity124 , the landlady of the inn in @entity99 and @entity127 , have heard their fair share of comments such as : ' whatever you do , do n't mention the paw '			2
