@entity2 chief operating officer @entity1 is planning to mount a challenge for one of @entity7 's two @entity6 seats , most likely the one held by @entity9 sen. @entity8 , @entity0 can reveal today			1
@entity1 is among the wealthiest women in @entity11 – her reported net worth is $ 1.05 billion – making the $ 30 or $ 40 million required to win the seat easily within her reach without raising a dime from anyone			1
' @entity1 wants to find a seat before the election in 2016 , when @entity21 will likely run for president , ' a source close to @entity1 's inner circle told @entity0			1
when @entity0 contacted @entity1 yesterday there was no comment			1
however , this morning a source close to her said that ' it is 100 per cent untrue			1
it would force her to choose sides between the two women she has been close to			1
however , a source close to @entity1 today told @entity0 the claims are ' 100 per cent untrue ' 2016 is the year sen. @entity8 will stand for re-election			1
@entity42 , the state 's other senator , wo n't face another contest until 2018 , but she could retire by then – leaving an open seat			2
@entity1 , @entity0 's source said , is n't likely to wait that long			1
a bruising fight between two ambitious women would force @entity21 to choose sides , between her former colleague in the @entity6 and the woman who managed the day - to - day operation of the @entity54 during @entity56 's second term in the @entity57			1
@entity1 was chief of staff to treasury secretary @entity58 from 1996 until the @entity59 left @entity60			1
the 44 - year - old married mother of two helped lead @entity54 ’s work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the @entity66 financial crisis			0
as her footprint grew , so did her influence			0
@entity69 lists her as the world 's sixth-most powerful woman , right behind @entity72 and @entity21			1
@entity73 and former speaker of the house @entity74 ranks # 22			0
@entity8 did n't make the list at all			2
@entity1 , the @entity77 - born executive whose book ' lean in ' is a call to arms for ambitious women in the workplace , has already faced questions about whether a run for political office is her inevitable next step			1
when asked about her plans at the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90 in january , she appeared to rule out a move from @entity92 to @entity93			0
asked , ' is politics for you ? ' she replied : ' not for me			0
i just have a wholesale agreement that we need more women in politics			0
' rival : @entity8 's seat in @entity7 is up for re-election in 2016			1
@entity1 made it as sixth on the @entity69 list of most powerful women			2
@entity8 did n't make it but the source waved off @entity1 's dismissal : ' do n't believe it			1
she 's the kind of woman who does n't look five years ahead , she looks 15			0
' ' she sees politics as her future , definitely			0
this is what she has mapped out			0
she has spent her life courting the most powerful people in the country and she 's an incredibly smart and focused woman – she knows what she wants			0
' @entity7 is a decidedly blue state , making @entity9 ' control of @entity6 seats a near shoo - in			2
@entity8 , 73 , won her last three elections by 10 , 20 and 10 percentage points , including her easy 2010 victory over @entity127 @entity126 , the former ceo and chairwoman of @entity129			1
that election cost $ 28 million for @entity8 to win , in a year where there was no simultaneous presidential contest driving up the price of running tv and radio ads. but she is used to deploying most of her campaign cash in the general election , not in a hotly contested primary that could weaken her and leave her cash - poor just in time for @entity127 to start attacking			1
the net effect of a @entity143 slugfest could be an easier playing field for a @entity145 hopeful , a @entity147 @entity127 consultant told @entity0			1
' that 's always what we look for , ' said the campaign operative , who asked not to be named			0
' when two evenly matched liberals punch each other silly , and money is no object for at least one of them , it 's the best scenario possible for us come november – as long as we can all get behind a single candidate ourselves			2
' @entity7 now has a so - called ' blanket ' primary , in which all the candidates – regardless of party – jockey for position in the hope of emerging as one of the top two vote - getters			0
those two then slug it out in a november runoff			0
inspiration : @entity1 has written ' @entity175 ' , a call to arms for ambitious women in the workplace so a dramatic move into politics would not come as a huge surprise a move from the executive suite to government 's elite would fit with the central message of @entity1 's book , that women need to push themselves in order to get ahead and realize their full potential			1
that platform , already a blueprint for rallying career women , will require government to ' lean in ' as well , she says , in order to create an environment that will allow working mothers to create their own solutions to workplace inequalities			2
' there 's a chicken - and - egg going on , ' she said during a @entity89 session on gender - driven growth			2
' we need better public and corporate policies			0
we need more women in leadership roles to get those policies			0
' @entity1 may have decided that she has to roll up her sleeves and start tinkering with federal law herself			2
' @entity1 is going to make a statement about her future soon , ' another source told @entity0			1
@entity1 's wealth and her coterie of powerful friends would give her instant credibility if she were to put @entity8 on notice more than two years before the 2016 elections			1
and her base of operations in tony @entity218 near @entity219 would serve her well in a statewide campaign			0
in august she and her family moved into their new compound in @entity224 , just minutes from @entity2 's headquarters			0
their sprawling 9,210 - square - foot home features a gym , movie theater and even a basketball court for her young children			0
currently @entity2 founder @entity233 's right - hand woman , @entity1 was lured to the social network site in 2008 from @entity235 , where she had been vice president of global online sales & operations since 2001			2
in 2012 , the @entity239 - educated businesswoman became the eighth member – and the first female member – of @entity2 's board of directors			0
in august she sold 2.4 million @entity2 shares worth $ 91 million , just five per cent of her total stake in the company			0
@entity246 , the ceo of @entity247 , is @entity1 's second husband			2
they maintain a low - key personal life , something that would change instantly if she were to dive headlong into @entity11 politics .			0

@entity1 , one of the business world 's biggest champions of correcting gender inequality in the workplace , is eying a *rebellion* against @entity9 @entity8 senator @entity8
but source close to @entity1 told @entity0 this morning the claims were ' 100 *%* untrue '
@entity1 was chief of staff to treasury sec. @entity58 when @entity56 was president , and could fund her own @entity6 race without missing the money
@entity8 is used to bruising elections but is *accustomed* to *spending* her *war* chest against @entity127 challengers , not aiming ads at fellow @entity9
' @entity1 wants to find a seat before the election in 2016 , ' said @entity0 's source , ' when @entity21 will likely run for president '
it would mean @entity56 would have to choose sides between the two women
