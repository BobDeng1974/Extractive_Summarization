sufferers of debilitating conditions like dementia and @entity4 ’s face a ‘ postcode lottery ’ on whether the @entity6 will pay for their care			1
patients are 18 times more likely to have their care funded in some parts of @entity11 than others , government data has revealed			2
and those in the north are far more likely to receive financial help than those in the south east			1
in the worst area , @entity18 , health authorities paid care bills for an average of just 13.2 patients per 50,000 people , while in @entity26 232.9 patients per 50,000 people received the help			2

and residents of @entity39 , @entity40 , were a fifth as likely to receive the help as those living ten miles away in @entity43 , according to figures published by the @entity45 ( @entity45 )			1
the data showed the number of people in each @entity50 area ( @entity50 ) who received @entity52 ( @entity53 ) – funding for the nursing home fees or home care visits of people with complex medical needs			1
anyone with serious medical conditions , such as those in the final stages of degenerative conditions like @entity64 ’s or who are paralysed , should have their care funded by the @entity6 regardless of their personal finances			1
but with budgets squeezed , health authorities have been accused of failing to give the funding to patients who are eligible for it			0
the figures revealed staggering differences between regions as well as local areas			0
the @entity77 was the worst region for providing free care , with only 30.9 patients per 50,000 people receiving the funds – less than half the national average of 69.5			0
by contrast , those in the @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity87 area were nearly twice as likely to receive free care than the national average			1
scores of families from across the country have complained to charities about problems obtaining the funding , including suffering long delays and ‘ intimidation ’ by health authority boards during applications			0
some have been forced to raid savings or sell their homes to pay care bills while they wait for , or appeal , a decision			0
patients living in @entity34 , @entity35 ( pictured ) , were six times more likely to have their care paid for than those six miles away in @entity37			2
file image used last year the @entity108 on @entity4 ’s and charity @entity107 carried out an inquiry into the @entity111 which found it was ‘ not fit for purpose ’ and failed ‘ vulnerable people and their families at a time when they need the most support ’			0
the charity ’s chief executive @entity117 said last night : ‘ more than a year has passed since we revealed the extent of the systemic failure of tick - box assessors to follow the correct procedures , and the government is still sticking their head in the sand			0
‘ they must start holding those responsible for the failings in the @entity52 system to account and bring an end to the current postcode lottery in care and abysmally poor practice			1
’ @entity6 staff and social workers have also reported being ‘ under pressure ’ to keep patients out of the scheme			2
former adult social care manager at @entity142 @entity141 , 60 , quit his job in september after claiming he was pressured by @entity6 managers because he ‘ refused to turn a blind eye ’ when the health service ‘ repeatedly denied funding ’ to eligible patients			1
mr @entity141 , from @entity149 , said : ‘ we have got a massively flawed system and it is a country - wide problem			0
those in the @entity84 area were nearly twice as likely to receive free care than the national average			2
pictured is a file image of @entity159 , @entity84 ‘ it is not right for the @entity6 to look to solve its funding problem by making patients suffer and pushing people away			1
’ the @entity45 figures showed the number of patients receiving the care funding per 50,000 people aged 18 and over , according to @entity171 practice populations , at the end of september			1
they did not take age or socioeconomic factors into account , so areas where there were a higher proportion of older people were more likely to have larger numbers requiring @entity53			0
however the data shows the same trends as the previous figures released in june which were weighted to reflect population differences			0
more than 62,000 patients currently receive @entity187 in @entity11 compared with fewer than 59,000 at the same time last year , but campaigners believe up to 150,000 are entitled to it – and that is likely to increase as the population ages			0
an @entity11 spokesperson said : ‘ the number of people receiving @entity53 funding can vary from area to area due to differences in population profiles and local services but to ensure a consistent and fair approach , @entity203 follow the @entity204 to establish eligibility			0
