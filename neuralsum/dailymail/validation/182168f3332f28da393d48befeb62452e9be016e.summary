@entity1 players and fans were left bemused ahead of their friendly against @entity4 when , instead of pumping out their national anthem , the stadium 's sound system instead played the anthem of @entity9			1
the @entity11 minnows , ranked 89th in the world by @entity13 , were facing the @entity15 runners - up at @entity17 's @entity16 on saturday but their large travelling support were unimpressed as the stadium @entity21 's mistake became apparent ahead of kick - off			1
rather than the familiar ' @entity28 ' , staff at the stadium which usually hosts the @entity26 's @entity25 played out ' @entity27 '			1
@entity1 players were left bemused when the @entity9 national anthem was played instead of theirs the players , stood proud with hands on their chests , look confused by the error , glancing around having listened to the @entity9 anthem , the @entity36 head for the handshakes with their heads down supporters instead the stadium had prepared a huge banner for the anthem but ended up booing it @entity1 ( 5 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 88 ) , @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity50 , @entity53 ( punyed 76 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 67 ) ; @entity56 ( @entity57 59 ) @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ; @entity63 , banega ; @entity64 ( @entity65 73 ) , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 78 ) ; @entity69 scorers : @entity71 54 , @entity65 88 the players stood out on the pitch , with their hands across their chests looked confused at first , before becoming increasingly frustrated as boos rang out on to the field			1
the supporters - who had prepared a ' @entity79 , @entity81 ' flag to be carried over the crowd - reacted furiously			0
@entity17 is home to one of the largest @entity85 communities outside of @entity11 and their followers outnumbered the @entity88 support			2
to make things worse , @entity1 fell to an expected defeat against an @entity4 side who left out @entity93 and @entity94			1
the distance from @entity1 to @entity9 is 7,909 miles , a fairly big mistake for the stadium staff to make @entity4 players celebrate after @entity65 ( left ) scored a goal during the international friendly @entity93 was not required by @entity4 in their 2 - 0 win , and neither was @entity102 's @entity94 @entity104 's side dominated the game and took the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a @entity108 own goal deflected from @entity110 's shot			1
substitute @entity65 then made sure of the win with a free kick from a tight angle on 88 minutes			0
let us salute , the @entity115 , proudly , to be its children , called we can , and let us swear our lives spiritedly , without rest to its good , consecrate ! of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness , @entity1 always nobly dreamed			2
to achieve this has been her eternal proposition , to keep it , her greatest glory			0
with inviolable faith , the path of progress , she strives to follow , to fulfill her great destiny , and conquer a happy future			0
a stern barrier protects her , against the clash of vile disloyalty , ever since the day when her soaring flag , wrote @entity138 with it 's blood			0
translated from @entity139 golden sun in the skies , golden seed in the steps , legend of courage , take a look at my country ! from the antiquity our heroic glory emerged , they did not give up their honour , my @entity9 people are strong ! the way was opened to the descendants , by the vast land i have			2
its unity is proper , i have an independent country , it welcomed the tests of time , like an eternal friend , our country is blessed , our country is such ! translated from @entity9			0

@entity4 beat @entity1 2 - 0 in an international friendly in @entity17
but @entity9 's anthem was played at ground instead of @entity1 's
players and fans were left bemused by the *bizarre* error at the @entity16
