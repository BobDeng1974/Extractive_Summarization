@entity9 was playing with the plastic ' @entity11 ' locomotive , which was advertised as being suitable for children aged 12 months or older			1
but the motorised toy became tangled in her hair and ripped out a three - inch patch from the middle of her head - leading her father to fear that it may never grow back			1
now the company which makes the train has been forced to issue a fresh warning about the dangers of children getting hair or clothes trapped in their toys			2
ordeal : @entity9 had a large patch of hair pulled out by a toy train made by @entity31 firm @entity30 fears : the two - year - old could be left with a permanent bald patch in the wake of the accident the toddler 's father @entity37 , from @entity39 in @entity40 , urged other parents to be wary of the @entity42 , made by @entity31 electronics giant @entity30			1
the Â £ 49.99 toy train set comes with a 32 - piece winding track , signals and toy buildings , as well as the motorised train and a cargo car			1
' we got @entity9 the train for @entity52 , ' said mr @entity37 , 37			2
' she has all the other @entity30 train toys , so we got her this one , the first motorised one they 've made			2
' i was sat next to her when she was happily playing with it , but before i knew what was going on , she had picked the plastic train from the track and ran it on top of her head			0
' the wheels took her hair and kept wrapping it around the wheels , pulling it out by the roots and leaving part of her head scalped			0
' torn out : this large clump of hair was caught in the wheels of the motorised toy locomotive danger : the firm that makes the train has now issued a new warning against getting hair or clothes caught mr @entity37 , a chef , said that because @entity9 is so young the accident earlier this month could have permanently damaged the growth of her hair			1
' she could be bald there now for the rest of her life , ' he said			2
' if her hair does n't start growing soon , we 'll know that it probably wo n't ever come back			0
' the hair was ripped clean from the roots and follicles			0
it is very powerful - i 've placed it in the palm of my hand and you can feel the wheels and motor grinding			0
' it is clearly a danger when young toddlers are playing with it			0
' warning : @entity106 's father @entity105 has demanded that @entity30 issue a recall of the train the toy came with a disclaimer advising parents not allow their children to remove the train from its tracks , but did not mention the risk posed by the motor , according to mr @entity37			1
he has called for @entity30 to implement a recall of the set and install an emergency cut - off feature to stop similar incidents in future			0
a spokesman for the company said : ' the @entity123 has been tested to @entity125 safety standards and has passed all tests for children over 12 months of age			0
' @entity30 aims to go above and beyond the standards required in the @entity125 tests and , as such , we have added a leaflet within the @entity134 packaging which contains a warning about only playing with the train on the track and not close to hair , body or clothes			1
