two weeks after @entity4 committed suicide , @entity1 troops and @entity3 soldiers fought together to rescue a group of high profile @entity8 prisoners in the final days of the war			1
the true story is one of the lesser known tales from @entity14 but reads like the plot of a @entity17 movie			0
it was the only time @entity19 forces fought alongside @entity1 soldiers during the six year war			1
@entity3 and @entity1 troops fought together during @entity14 to defend a @entity23 , pictured the unlikely alliance was formed to defend a group of high profile @entity8 prisoners from an advancing @entity28 unit historian @entity30 's book ' @entity31 ' recounts the unlikely alliance that was forged to save a group of mainly @entity8 politicians who had been held captive at @entity23 in @entity34 since the @entity1 invasion of @entity8			1
the group included former @entity8 president @entity37 , former prime ministers @entity38 and @entity40 , military generals @entity41 and @entity43 and even a famous tennis star called @entity45			1
fourteen @entity3 soldiers , with just two tanks and limited ammunition , teamed up with about 20 @entity1 @entity50 troops to defend the castle from an oncoming ss unit			1
over two days , the bizarre alliance , led by 27 - year - old @entity55 captain @entity54 , managed to withstand an @entity28 bombardment until @entity19 reinforcements arrived			1
the battle was one of the last of the war			0
@entity30 's book is the culmination of 20 years of research on the battle fought in early may , 1945			0
it began after the guards at @entity23 in @entity34 's @entity68 fled on may 4 , as the @entity1 army became increasingly leaderless			1
former @entity8 prime minister @entity40 , left , and tennis player @entity45 , far right , were both held prisoner and fought in the @entity71 the castle was run as a subcamp of @entity75 concentration camp but the @entity77 prisoners were held in relative luxury and were given access to the library and housed in individual guest rooms			1
once the guards had fled , the inmates armed themselves with weapons including submachine guns and rifles left behind in the castle as they waited for @entity19 forces to rescue them			2
on may 5 , 1945 , troops from the @entity3 103rd @entity90 liberated the castle			2
they had teamed up with a @entity1 unit , which had been persuaded to help the prisoners by inmate @entity94 , who had left the castle to try to find the nearest @entity19 unit			1
@entity30 wrote in @entity97 that the unit , led by ' surrender - minded ' @entity1 @entity99 , decided to help as they after ' realising that aiding in their rescue would reflect well on him and his men			0
' capt @entity54 , then ranked as a first lieutenant , had volunteered to lead a patrol to the castle			0
his men included six members of the all - @entity109 , 17th @entity110			0
anti-fascist @entity8 politician @entity38 , left , and former @entity112 prime minister @entity111 , right , were also held captive former @entity8 president @entity37 ( centre ) was also held captive at @entity23 during the war within hours of the alliance reaching the castle , it was attacked by @entity28 troops			1
the @entity120 troops used antitank guns , which destroyed parts of the castle , and attacked with submachine guns			0
@entity30 said that the @entity8 vip prisoners , including @entity126 , son of @entity128 prime minister @entity127 , also took up arms			1
he wrote that as the @entity28 bombardment intensified , capt @entity54 's solution ' was literally medieval : the defenders and the @entity8 notables would withdraw into the castle 's massive keep			1
' they would use their few remaining rounds of ammunition , their bayonets , and — if necessary — their fists to make the @entity28 men fight for every stairwell , every hallway , every floor			0
' however , the surviving castle defenders were saved when @entity3 103rd @entity90 troops finally arrived			0
@entity146 , who is regarded as a hero of anti-nazi resistance in @entity1 and @entity34 for his action , died during the battle after being shot by a sniper			2
@entity54 won the @entity152 for his efforts defending the castle			0
the agent of that action was the always - helpful @entity94 , a.k.a. @entity158 , who volunteered to go find the nearest @entity19 unit and bring it back to secure the castle			2
vaulting aboard a bike liberated from a shopkeeper in the surrounding village , @entity94 set off for @entity164 , a large town on the @entity166 six miles northwest of the castle			0
he was unaware that much of the town was occupied by elements of a @entity28 regiment , and was lucky to stumble instead upon a group of @entity50 troops led by a surrender - minded major named @entity99			2
upon hearing of the @entity8 notables at @entity23 — and no doubt realizing that aiding in their rescue would reflect well on him and his men — @entity99 dispatched @entity94 toward inns - bruck , thirty - eight miles to the southwest			2
@entity180 had just been taken by the @entity3 @entity181 , and chances were excellent that @entity94 would encounter @entity3 troops moving east toward @entity164			0
but to be on the safe side , and possibly to better his own chances with the @entity3 , @entity99 jumped in his @entity186 and , leading a truck packed with some twenty @entity50 troops , sped off toward @entity189 , thirteen miles in the opposite direction .			0

the two sides fought off an @entity28 bombardment at @entity23 in @entity34
they defended the castle and rescued high profile @entity8 prisoners
former @entity8 presidents and prime ministers were kept prisoner
it was the only time @entity19 and @entity1 troops fought together
