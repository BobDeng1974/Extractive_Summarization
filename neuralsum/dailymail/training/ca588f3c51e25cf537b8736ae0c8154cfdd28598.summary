by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 16:31 est , 2 may 2012 from their brunette hair to their dress sense , twin sisters @entity2 and @entity3 have a number of things in common			1
but the 42 - year - olds share more than just their looks - they are both married to the same man			2
the sisters are in a polygamous marriage with @entity13 , 43 , who is also wed to a third woman - their cousin @entity14			2
the @entity16 , who are fundamentalist mormons from @entity18 , @entity19 , live together in a large family home and have 24 children between them			1
@entity3 joined the family as his third wife in 2000			1
in the eyes of their @entity43 religion , all three women are equally married to @entity13			1
they each have their own bedroom , and @entity45 between the three rooms each evening			2
@entity3 , who works in the family cleaning business with @entity14 , 43 , said : ' the fact that @entity13 was married to @entity2 did n't bother me at all			1
i took it as a sign he would be a good husband for me as well			0
' as teenagers , @entity2 and i liked some of the same guys			0
i thought it might even be good if we married the same man			2
' ' i was attracted to both girls ' : @entity13 with @entity14 ( centre ) and @entity2 ( right ) while courting together a year before they were married at a joint wedding ceremony in 1990 ' @entity2 opened my mind to it ' : @entity13 smiles for the camera after his marriage to @entity3 ( centre ) in 2000 , which was happily attended by his other wives @entity14 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) @entity2 added : ' i know that some people are uncomfortable at the thought of two sisters sharing a husband			1
' but there 's a good chance if a husband is compatible with one sister , he 'll be well matched with another			0
' @entity13 was just 18 when he began dating @entity2 and her cousin @entity14 at the same time and married them in a joint @entity43 ceremony in 1990			1
the following day , @entity14 became his legal wife when they married again at a ceremony under state law , while @entity2 acted as witness			1
' even in our community joint courtships are rare , ' said @entity2			0
' we knew we were taking on a huge challenge and responsibility			0
' the accepted pattern in our culture is for a couple to prove themselves first in a monogamous marriage , before taking on the challenges of a second wife			2
' happy family : @entity14 and @entity2 ( left image ) in 1989 and twin sisters @entity2 and @entity3 ( right ) in 1997			1
@entity2 and @entity14 encouraged @entity13 to start pursuing @entity3 , who had just gone through a divorce to a man with six wives in love : construction company boss @entity13 and @entity3 during their engagement in 2000 willing wives : @entity13 and @entity3 ( pictured here , centre , in 2004 ) married in a service at their @entity19 home in 2000 , with @entity14 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) standing beside them keeping them sweet : @entity3 alternates between each of his wives ' bedrooms every evening polygamy among @entity118 began with the founder of the @entity121 movement @entity122 when he declared in @entity123 in 1831 that he had seen visions telling him that ' plural marriage ' should be practised			1
after his death in 1844 , followers took polygamy to @entity19 , where it was practised publicly until 1890 when it was renounced by the @entity121 church to win statehood for the territory			2
during that time , @entity133 issued the @entity134 in 1962 which re-asserted that polygamy was illegal in all @entity136 territories			2
the @entity121 argued that such laws infringed their right to religiously - based practise under the @entity136 @entity140			0
but a ruling by the @entity142 in 1878 stated that they were not protected based on the long - standing legal principle that while government can not interfere with religious beliefs , it can with practices			2
various splinter groups left the church after the @entity150 in order to continue polygamy			2
nowadays , there are said to be more than 30,000 people practising polygamy in @entity19 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			0
states occasionally take action against polygamists , notably @entity161 , who was sentenced to five years in prison for bigamy in @entity19 in august 2001			0
one famous @entity43 is @entity136 presidential hopeful @entity164 , whose father @entity165 was born in 1907 in a settlement in @entity167 that had been founded in the 1880s by @entity118 fleeing @entity136 anti-polygamy laws			1
the last polygamist in @entity165 â€™s direct ancestry was his great - grandfather @entity172 , who had three wives			0
@entity165 's paternal grandfather @entity174 was monogamous and the @entity175 outlawed polygamy in 1890			0
describing their joint dates , @entity13 said : ' since @entity14 and @entity2 were close friends and were interested in pursuing me together , the best thing i could do was to nurture that combined friendship			0
' i was attracted to both girls and knew that individual relationships would develop in time			0
' @entity2 and @entity14 had been married to @entity13 for ten years when they both encouraged him to start pursuing a relationship with @entity2 's twin @entity3			1
@entity3 had just gone through a divorce after her marriage to an older man @entity190 , who had six wives , broke down due to his gambling and abusive treatment			1
one evening , while @entity3 and her five children were staying with the @entity3 family , she felt a sudden spark of chemistry with @entity13			1
@entity13 admitted : ' i had a connection with @entity3 , but the fact she was @entity2 's twin was weird - they both had the same mannerisms			1
but @entity2 opened my mind to it			0
' @entity14 added : ' i was excited at the prospect of @entity206 becoming part of our family			0
i had a genuine love and concern for her and wanted her to be the happiest she could possibly be			0
' @entity13 and @entity3 married in another @entity43 service in their home , with @entity2 and @entity14 standing beside them , and celebrated with a family meal			1
the @entity16 were investigated by state authorities several years ago for their beliefs and attempted to keep their plural marriage secret for many years			0
but two years ago , they decided to talk about their relationship to raise awareness , and to try to overcome prejudices against their religion and lifestyle			0
although polygamy is generally illegal in all 50 states , practitioners are almost never prosecuted unless there is evidence of abuse , statutory rape , welfare fraud , or tax evasion			0
the three wives and their husband have co-written a book ' @entity238 ' , and some of their adult children also contributed to the story			0
' we hope that by talking about our way of life , polygamy will step closer to being an accepted lifestyle and the laws that criminalise it might change , ' said @entity13			1
wants acceptance : @entity13 hopes that by talking about polygamy it will change attitudes and even the law			1

@entity3 quartet live together and have 24 children between them
twins married in @entity43 ceremonies , while cousin became legal wife
@entity3 alternates between each of their bedrooms every evening
he wants to change attitudes and even get polygamy *decriminalised*
