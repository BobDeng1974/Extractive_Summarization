by @entity0 and @entity1 they are meant to provide affordable homes for families who ca n’t get on the property ladder			0
but last night a housing association was accused of gazumping its own customers – after hiking the price of their flats by up to 50 per cent before they had even had the chance to move in			1
dozens of first - time buyers had paid their deposits and were waiting for the deals to be completed			2
but they were left high and dry after the state - funded housing association behind the development increased the prices – in some cases , by up to £ 150,000 – to ‘ take advantage ’ of spiralling property values			1
high and dry : buyers outside the development in @entity25 , south @entity26 , who faced huge price hikes wandle housing group , which rents out thousands of state - subsidised homes , made a u-turn last night and dropped its prices back to the level agreed with its buyers late last year			1
but critics accused the group , which is meant to help the less well - off to get homes , of trying to play the housing market to boost its income			1
housing minister @entity40 said : ‘ this is unfair , sharp practice by the housing association			1
the would - be buyers put down a deposit in good faith , and have been treated badly by @entity46 due to their delays and failure to communicate			1
’ the association offered a share in 34 homes in the south @entity26 suburb of @entity25			2
buyers would pay rent but also take out a mortgage to buy a stake in their flats			0
@entity46 has been given £ 25million of taxpayers ’ money in the past two years to help pay for the development			1
according to its accounts , it holds assets worth nearly half a billion pounds			0
but last week it raised the prices of the flats steeply – in some cases , by more than 50 per cent in six months			2
one stake in a flat for which a buyer agreed to pay £ 267,000 was pushed up to more than £ 400,000			0
the conflict came as fears grow over a housing bubble , with property prices soaring across the country customers were told of the move by letter			2
the housing association explained that there were ‘ significant changes in the @entity26 property market which are beyond our control ’			1
@entity26 house prices have risen by 17 per cent in the past year , with the average price of a home in the capital now £ 459,000			2
the flats were meant to be affordable housing and those who were offered them qualified under the association ’s rules as people deserving of state help			1
the buyers put down £ 500 deposits in december and were told the deals on their flats would be completed in march			0
however last week they received the letters , explaining that the terms of their agreements had been altered			0
one buyer of a two - bedroom flat was told her £ 245,000 stake was now going to cost £ 355,000			2
another couple who agreed to pay £ 267,000 found that the price had become £ 417,000			0
' this is unfair , sharp practice			0
the would - be buyers who put down a deposit in good faith have been treated badly ' - housing minister @entity40 on average the increases amounted to £ 55,000 for a one - bedroom flat and £ 115,000 for a two - bedroom unit			1
sales analyst @entity119 , 44 , saw the £ 260,000 price he had agreed for a half share of a flat increase to £ 383,000			0
he told @entity26 ’s @entity123 that the housing association ‘ behaved like mercenaries ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity46 is taking advantage of the house price boom			1
i do n’t know how else to explain it			0
they have seen an opportunity to get as much money out of us as possible			0
’ the price increases came after delays at the development which means that flats will not be ready for occupation until the end of the summer			0
yesterday morning @entity46 , whose chief executive @entity139 earns around £ 150,000 a year , said it was obliged to boost the prices			1
‘ unfortunately external market movement has resulted in substantial increases to the value of these homes in a relatively short period of time , ’ said a spokesman			0
but its policy changed during the day as ministers made their disapproval clear and protests were made to the @entity154			0
last night , @entity46 apologised to its buyers , saying : ‘ we are very sorry for the uncertainty this situation has caused to our prospective purchasers this week			2
