by @entity0 the combination of @entity2 and @entity3 is a fabulous one for @entity4			1
the way they complement each other is quite superb and they will go down as one of the great fast bowling partnerships			2
clearly they have learnt from @entity11 ’s in the second test where their bowling was a bit short			2
on thursday , as at @entity17 , they pitched the ball up and allowed it to swing but provided different challenges for the @entity22 batsmen			1
it might sound obvious but if they were similar bowlers they would not be as successful as a duo			0
as a captain you want variety and these two are like gold dust for @entity32			2
blistering attack : @entity3 was in sublime form at @entity35 on day one of the fourth @entity36 sultans of swing : @entity2 and @entity3 wreaked havoc on @entity41 's batting order at @entity35 when the conditions suit and it is swinging you go to @entity2 and when you need something to happen and have to think outside the box — maybe when the ball has stopped swinging — you go to @entity3			1
if the game drifts or you need a magical spell , @entity3 is the man			1
he ’s a very clever cricketer , as he showed yesterday by the way he used the short ball to push batsmen back before then getting them out to the fuller delivery			0
@entity2 is the fitter bowler and can bowl longer spells and i think it ’s best to use @entity3 in short , sharp spells , certainly with the way his body is at the moment			1
they can be stubborn with their fields but they know their game			0
you have to manage the pair and keep an eye on them			2
you need to make them think that any change of field is their idea but you have to be strong with them			0
you do n’t have to talk them through what you are doing			0
top of his game : @entity2 appeals to the umpire as @entity78 gets a quick single in @entity41 's first innings @entity2 might have been trying to bowl too quickly at the start of this season			1
after what happened in @entity86 people were saying he might have lost his nip and he came back fitter and might have stretched a bit too much for pace			0
but the biggest difference since @entity11 ’s , when @entity4 did not take full advantage of perfect bowling conditions on the first day , is that the ball has consistently swung both here at @entity35 and at the @entity95			1
when it swings there is no - one better in the world than @entity2			1
you could say @entity100 is in the same category but i would always go with @entity2 because of the way he goes from inswing to outswing so effortlessly			2
morale : @entity4 were in a jubilant mood as they tore through @entity41 's side , with the tourist finishing on 152 the old - fashioned way would be to bowl five outswingers and then an inswinger — as @entity111 did to bowl @entity112 on thursday — but @entity2 can go from one to the other at will			1
the four deliveries he bowled at @entity116 here are about as good as it gets			0
it must have been an absolute nightmare to face			0
it is a skill he has and he does it with aggression			0
one thing i will say : these two really need looking after			0
we have highlighted in @entity126 this week how much cricket @entity4 will play in the next 18 months and @entity32 will have to resist the temptation to over bowl them because the step down to the supporting cast is a big one at the moment			2
time to step up : @entity134 , left , and @entity135 need to improve to take pressure off @entity3 and @entity2 a lot of people felt @entity139 should have played here but there is no guarantee he would have bowled well and i am pleased @entity4 stuck with @entity134			1
batsmen seem to get chance after chance but as soon as a bowler puts in one indifferent performance there are calls to bring in someone else			0
give @entity134 a full go — and @entity112 — and then decide at the end of the series if there is a need for change			0
we have to remember that @entity134 and @entity135 are not yet the finished article — @entity2 and @entity3 most certainly are .			1

@entity3 finished with six *wickets* for *25* runs at @entity35
his partner - in - crime @entity2 took three for *46* runs in first innings
they continued their fine form from @entity17 in the last test
their variety makes them such a potent pair for @entity4 in attack
