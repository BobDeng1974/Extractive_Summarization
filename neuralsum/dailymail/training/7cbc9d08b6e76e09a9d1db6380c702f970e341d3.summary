by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 no sooner has @entity2 set foot on @entity5 soil than @entity7 's volatile striker is playing down @entity9 ’s @entity8 hopes and talking up his dreams of becoming the best player on the planet			1
@entity2 was not about to let the small matter of a draw with @entity15 — the latest in a dismal run of results for @entity7 — disrupt his plans for world domination as he looked ahead to the eagerly anticipated @entity21 opener with @entity23 ’s side in @entity24 on saturday			1
as wildcards go , they do not come much wilder than @entity2 but the @entity27 are relying on their unpredictable front man hitting top form , just as he did in @entity30 when he finished joint leading scorer with three goals			2
confident : @entity7 striker @entity2 believes his side are better than @entity8 opponents @entity9 preparation : @entity2 controls the ball under pressure from team - mate @entity38 ( right ) during training typically , the @entity41 star is not lacking in confidence			1
‘ people will always want to talk about @entity2 , people always want to write about @entity2 , but i am used to that , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ now is the time for me to do my talking , but i want to do my talking on the field			0
i still have dreams of being the best player in the world , and legends are made at the @entity8			2
‘ i totally believe that @entity7 can win the @entity8			1
i am realistic and know that maybe there are one or two teams who are operating at a level higher than us — but one of them are definitely not @entity9			2
‘ i ’m convinced that we can beat anybody			0
with the quality and experience we have , @entity7 are a team any nation should fear playing			2
’ @entity2 ’s claims do not quite stack up on current form			0
@entity69 ’s side have failed to win any of their last seven games , including draws with @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 before wednesday ’s embarrassing flop , the 1 - 1 draw with @entity77 , in @entity78			2
the @entity27 landed in @entity79 on friday and will play their final warm - up game against @entity5 club @entity81 on sunday			0
@entity69 insists there is nothing to worry about but he is unsure of his best formation , never mind starting line - up , with less than a week to go before the @entity9 game			1
however , the four - time @entity8 winners are notoriously off - colour before major tournaments and @entity23 and his players will not need reminding about their painful @entity91 defeat by @entity7 in @entity92 two years ago			1
decision time : @entity7 boss @entity69 has not yet picked his starting xi to face @entity9 getting ready : @entity96 ( left ) and @entity97 ( second right ) tussle for the ball in training on saturday @entity2 beat his former @entity102 team - mate @entity101 in a penalty shootout and the 23 - year - old is ready to be equally ruthless as the two men prepare to meet again in his first @entity8			1
‘ i am not even thinking that when we play @entity9 that i will be playing against former team - mates , ’ he added			0
‘ when the game is over we will share a hug — but until the final whistle there can be no friendships			0
’ that shootout will always be remembered for @entity115 ’s audacious chipped effort past @entity101 on a night when the @entity117 playmaker was simply outstanding			0
the bad news for @entity9 is that , even at 35 , @entity115 remains at the top of his game as he attempts to end his international career by winning the @entity8 for a second time			1
‘ the feeling to represent your country in a @entity8 is amazing , and the feeling when you win one is indescribable , ’ said @entity115			1
‘ i have already been fortunate enough to win the @entity8 , and just maybe i can win one more			0
’ memorable : @entity7 midfielder @entity115 scores a chipped penalty past @entity9 's @entity101 at @entity30 the @entity27 experienced the heat of @entity131 in last summer ’s @entity132 , even though it will not compare to the stifling humidity of northernmost @entity24			1
during a training camp in @entity135 last week , @entity69 had his players training in a shed specially designed to replicate the oppressive conditions and @entity115 believes the @entity139 teams will have just as good a chance as their @entity142 rivals			1
‘ i think a lot is being made about a @entity139 team never winning the @entity8 in @entity142 , ’ he added			0
‘ i understand why @entity131 are favourites , but with the quality of some of the @entity139 teams it is crazy to think it ca n’t happen			0
‘ you ca n’t just dismiss the heat			0
we played in the @entity132 last year and it does get very intense , but all the coaching staff and trainers will be doing everything they can to help the players combat it			0
’ talent : @entity2 is looking to let his football do the talking after a number of controversial off - field incidents @entity115 was rather more respectful of @entity9 than @entity2 , and , in particular , captain @entity162 as the two veteran midfielders go head to head once again			1
he said : ‘ @entity162 is one of the great central midfield players of the generation , maybe the greatest			1
‘ of course , as you get older you have to adapt your game , but he has proved he has got the intelligence to do that			0
when he finally decides to retire i think he will be put in the same class as players like @entity173 and @entity174			0

@entity2 believes teams should fear @entity7 at the @entity8
@entity9 face @entity69 's side in their opening match on june 14
@entity69 is yet to decide on his starting xi
@entity115 calls @entity162 ' one of the greatest midfielders of the generation '
