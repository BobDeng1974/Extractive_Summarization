now former reserve captain @entity18 has resigned so he can publish what promises to be a highly - embarrassing account of his time serving with the @entity2 's @entity22			1
former reserve captain @entity18 has become the second @entity2 officer to resign in order to publish a warts and all account of the @entity9 war mr @entity18 's role in @entity9 was to promote positive coverage of the war in the @entity30 media , creating the impression that the campaign was having a positive effect and that the @entity2 was in control			1
but according to his book @entity36 , due to be published next week , that was often far from the case			0
mr @entity18 , who now works as a journalist for the @entity39 in @entity40 , said he would regularly witness soldiers being brought back to camp with limbs blown off by ied explosions			0
he told the @entity45 : that was never something we were going to shout from the rooftops to the press but i grew uncomfortable with the fact people back home were not really being made aware of this			2
he added : ' lie is too strong a word for it			0
our key message was that we were in the process of helping @entity9			0
' i was n't exactly @entity61 but i was conscious of seeing a number of guys getting badly injured - you never heard so much about that in the press			0
' @entity30 troops boarding a @entity68 helicopter in @entity69 in 2009 because traveling by road had become so dangerous mr @entity18 said he would regularly see soldiers returning to base with their limbs blown off by @entity74 explosions in total , 448 @entity30 lives have been lost in @entity9 , including ( from top row left to right ) sergeant @entity78 , corporal @entity79 and private @entity80 , with ( bottom row left to right ) private @entity82 , private @entity83 and private @entity84			1

dr @entity10 served as a captain in the @entity11 when he was commissioned to write his book the @entity13 denied claims it had tried to block the book using the @entity109			1

it said : ' the @entity13 is not in any way attempting to prevent the book 's publication			2
' the @entity2 simply decided that it was inappropriate for a serving officer to publish a book that is so heavily critical of the @entity2 , the @entity13 and our allies			0
