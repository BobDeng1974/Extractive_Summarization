@entity1 taxpayers will have to pay more than £ 800million after the @entity2 spent nearly £ 6billion in ‘ error ’ last year			1
auditors yesterday refused to sign off the @entity2 accounts for the 19th year in succession as they revealed that the spending errors are 23 per cent up on the year before			1
while countries across @entity10 were forced to rein in spending , @entity2 bosses paid out £ 5.7billion to ineligible projects , of which @entity1 ’s share is £ 832million			1
questionable : the annual report reveals the amount of unexplained spending has risen and the books have not been given a clean bill of health for the 19th year in a row the rate of errors increased from 3.9 per cent to 4.8 per cent of spending , a rise of nearly a quarter			1
the @entity26 found that supervision and control of @entity30 spending worth another £ 117billion was only ‘ partially effective ’			2
the fraud affects all areas of @entity2 spending , the watchdog said			1
rural spending was the worst area , with 7.9 per cent of the € 15 billion ( £ 12.6billion ) rural development expenditure made in error			1
this means about £ 1billion was wrongly paid out by beaurocrats			1
6.8 percent of the € 40.7 billion ( £ 34.3billion ) spent on regional policy , energy and transport was also spent in error			1
that mistake cost more than £ 2 billion			0
@entity46 , the president of the @entity26 , warned that a backlog of bills ‘ will put added pressure on @entity2 cash flows and may increase the risk of error over the next few years ’			1
attack : @entity54 also attacked the refusal of the @entity56 to make cuts to its bloated bureaucracy at a time when countries are slashing the cost of governments at home @entity66 leader @entity65 said : ‘ it is about time the peoples of @entity10 were able to get this @entity2 albatross off their backs , or at least out of their pockets			2
’ @entity74 , from the @entity73 think - tank , said the auditor ’s report is proof that the @entity2 ’s budgeting procedures are ‘ fundamentally flawed ’			2
the @entity56 is forecasting the recovery across the 28 - countries will continue into the second half of the year , albeit at a slowpace			0
the executive arm of the @entity2 said it expects the region 's economy to grow by 0.5 per cent over the second half of the year and be flat for the whole year			1
in its previous forecast in may , it predicted a 0.1 percent annual decline			0
it also expects the 17 - country @entity89 to continue its recovery from recession in quarterly terms			0
however , over 2013 as a whole , the @entity89 is still expected to have contracted 0.4 per cent			0
in 2014 though , it is penciling in 1.1 percent growth			0
the @entity89 's unemployment is expected to remain at its record - high of 12.2 per cent this year and next			0
last year , the @entity26 said the budget was riddled with fraud and error – and that the situation was getting worse			2
@entity104 critics said the finding strengthened the case for going beyond a freeze and cutting the @entity2 ’s vast budget			2
@entity54 also attacked the refusal of the @entity56 to make cuts to its bloated bureaucracy at a time when countries are slashing the cost of governments at home			0
@entity118 , @entity104 spokesman on @entity120 control , told @entity121 : ' another year , another story of lax monitoring and shambolic control			0
' i understand full well that much of the misspending occurs when member states fail to exercise proper supervision of spending within their borders , but the fact is that the @entity2 must accept ultimate responsibility for what happens to the money it dishes out			1
' every year we are told the @entity56 is serious about tackling the problem			0
every year it gets still worse			0
it is shameful to the @entity2 's integrity and unacceptable to its taxpayers			1
' if you found misappropriation and mis - spending on this scale in a commercial business - or in a properly - accountable public administration - there would be sackings all round			0
in @entity30 , it 's " carry on squandering "			0
' a @entity56 spokesman has disputed that taxpayers would have to pay £ 800m , saying it would be clawed back .			2

@entity2 spent nearly £ 6billion in ' error ' last year
rural spending was the worst area with £ 1billion wasted
@entity1 taxpayers will be *liable* for more than £ 800million
