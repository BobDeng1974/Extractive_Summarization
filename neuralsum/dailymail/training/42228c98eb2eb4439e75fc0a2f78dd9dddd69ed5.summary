by @entity0 @entity2 police investigating the disappearance of @entity4 have revealed they questioned a heroin addict in connection with sex attacks on five young @entity9 girls in the @entity10			1
@entity11 , 40 , who died in a freak tractor accident in 2009 , worked at the @entity13 in @entity14 , which @entity15 disappeared from - he was sacked a year before she vanished			1
now it has been revealed that @entity2 investigators suspected @entity11 of being involved in the sexual abuse of five girls at holiday homes in the region between 2004 and 2006			1
@entity2 police investigating the disappearance of @entity4 ( right ) questioned @entity11 , ( left ) a heroin addict in connection with sex attacks on five young @entity9 girls resort : @entity25 went missing from this holiday apartment at the @entity27 in @entity14 in may 2007			1
@entity11 worked at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity2 , which @entity15 disappeared from and was sacked a year before she vanished a @entity2 police source told @entity29 : ' these cases were investigated by local police and @entity11 was arrested			1
no charges were brought due to lack of evidence			1
' this week @entity9 detectives increased tension with their @entity2 counterparts , who claim they came up the link first in october , when they announced they are looking for a prolific paedophile who was suspected of breaking into holiday properties where @entity9 families were staying and sexually abusing five white @entity9 girls aged between seven and 10			1
in six of the break - ins , the man sat on or got into bed with young girls			1
on one occasion , he abused two young girls in the same villa			2
questioned : @entity49 said she could not remember the night of @entity25 's disappearance - but was sure he would have been at home watching television at the time two of the attacks were in the resort of @entity14 , where @entity25 was staying in a holiday apartment with her family when she was taken			1
there were also four in @entity60 and six in the @entity64 , @entity63 district and most of the attacks took place in low season			2
they had previously been discounted by @entity2 investigators because they are spread over a wide geographical area and there were no apparent attempts at abduction			2
nine of the 12 incidents were reported to @entity2 police at the time they happened , and details of three of those became known to @entity9 investigators only after they made televised appeals last autumn			1
new clue : detectives on the @entity25 case say the man they are looking for wore a distinctive burgundy top @entity11 was sacked a year before the @entity91 family arrived at the holiday resort after he was caught stealing from the resort - one theory was that he may have abducted the @entity9 girl to get revenge on his former employers			1
the @entity98 has learned , however , that @entity100 detectives do not consider @entity11 to be a strong suspect and as well trying to gather more clues on the sex attacks on @entity9 children , are investigating a gang of at least three burglars who had previously targeted the holiday resort where @entity15 was abducted from			1
analysis of mobile phone data shows the men were close to the complex at the time she vanished , and were in ‘ intense ’ phone contact with each other in the following hours			0
in @entity2 , it is claimed that @entity11 ’s phone was also near the @entity13 when @entity25 disappeared			1
his widow said she is sure he was not responsible for her disappearance - and insisted he would have been at home watching tv at the time			0
the suspect was wearing a distinctive burgundy long sleeve top , on one of those occasions it was described as having a white circle on the back			0
but ms @entity49 , 40 , said ' i ca n't remember ever seeing him wear anything like that			0
' she told the @entity29 she met police officers in a cafe near her home in @entity136			0
' they said they suspected him because he used to work at the @entity27 complex where the @entity141 were staying and because they had tracked the signal from his mobile phone to the area where @entity25 disappeared the night she vanished , ' she said			2
i kept repeating @entity146 was innocent but they said it was not for me to say			0
' she lives a 15 - minute drive away from the scene of the young girl 's disappearance on may 3 , 2007			1
ms @entity49 said that she could not remember the night of @entity25 's disappearance - but insisted she would have turned him in if she thought he was responsible			0
she added : ' it 's a long time ago , but i 'm sure he would have been at home watching tv			0
that 's what he always did after work			0
' @entity11 , who fathered ms @entity49 11 - year - old son , once served a five - year prison sentence for burglary			1
however , his wife said that although he was ' no angel ' he would not have been behind the suspected kidnapping			0
this week detective chief inspector @entity169 said : ' this is an offender who has got a very , very unhealthy interest in young , white , female children whom he is attacking whilst they are on holiday in their beds			0
' @entity25 's parents , @entity177 and @entity91 posed two years ago with a picture of how she might now look witnesses describe the man as having dark , tanned skin with short dark unkempt hair			1
he spoke in @entity184 with a foreign accent , his voice was described as slow , or possibly slurred			0
he was sometimes bare chested , some describe him as having a pot belly , and three victims said that he had a noticeable odour			0
police said the suspect may have been in the villa or looking round the villa for some time before committing the offences or being disturbed either by a parent , or the child waking up , and said he remained calm , even when disturbed			2
on two occasions , they said , the noise of a bin collection lorry could be heard nearby			0
@entity201 said that tracing the man is one of his priority lines of inquiry			0
he said : ' we need to establish the identity of this man - these offences are very serious and no - one has been charged in connection with them			2
' mr @entity169 's team currently have 38 people classed as ' persons of interest ' to the inquiry , and are also sifting through details of 530 known sex offenders whose whereabouts they can not account for.of those 59 are classed as high priority , and some of those are @entity9			2
@entity9 investigators have so far sent three international letters of request to @entity2 authorities over the investigation , covering 41 priority areas for the team , involving 287 separate requests			1
deputy assistant commissioner @entity229 showed his anger at the slow pace of the legal process , saying : ' that 's causing us frustration because we know what we want to do and we are ready to go with that			0
but the process is the process			0
' another 30 letters have been written to other @entity241 countries , but the force would not reveal where			0
@entity25 , who was then nearly four , disappeared from her family 's holiday apartment in @entity14 in the @entity10 on may 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends			1
@entity9 detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster 's disappearance in july last year - two years into a review of the case - and made renewed appeals on television in the @entity9 , the @entity256 and @entity257			2
after shelving their inquiry into @entity25 's disappearance in 2008 , @entity2 authorities said last october that a review had uncovered enough new information to justify reopening it .			2
