@entity0 , though , insists that @entity3 , who joined @entity1 in a Â£ 5million deal in the summer of 2013 , is going nowhere in next month 's transfer window and has a key role to play at the @entity38			1
@entity3 catches the @entity8 midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism ' it is often the case ( to sell ) when a manager talks about a player , ' @entity0 said			1
' but that is absolutely not the case			0
it was not my intention to give the impression i do not want @entity3 here			2
' when i talked about him i was talking about the specific instances where he can do better , in relation to the yellow cards he has picked up			0
' when i talked about laziness i meant the situations he gets into to get bookings , not his overall performances			0
@entity3 clearly threw his arm in the direction of can as @entity1 slumped to defeat ' yes , he can do better , but so can all our players			1
with @entity3 it is a case of me trying to help him , him trying to help himself and pushing on			2

' @entity3 won his solitary @entity4 cap in 2012 and was called up to @entity70 's squad last october for the @entity72 qualifiers against @entity73 and @entity74			1

' but you need to be focused in those situations , especially a dangerous situation like a set - piece			0
' i was disappointed with that goal as it was avoidable but i thought @entity3 's performance was good			2
' we analyse the players and get all the feedback from their performances and on the ball he was one of our highest passers in the game			0
' i thought he put himself about , had good energy and he was possibly our best passer on the day			0
he was probably our most threatening midfielder on the ball but i know he can be even better			0
@entity3 capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for @entity8 's fourth ' performance-wise , he 's capable of running a game , grabbing it by the scruff of the neck and really dictating it , but what you forget is that he 's a really young player			1
' @entity1 have had a demanding festive fixture list with the @entity122 visit of @entity123 sandwiched in between trips to @entity125 and @entity8			1
they travel to @entity33 before heading to @entity126 again for a third - round @entity128 tie at @entity129 on saturday			0
