it is very rare to have a village for sale and it would suit anyone who could afford it			0
' it really is a wonderful place and we have already had a number of calls			2
' the village dates back to at least 1086 , when it featured in the @entity222 in the @entity223			1
then it had 17 households , made up of 12 villagers , three smallholders and two slaves little known because of its isolated position , it lies tucked between hills at the end of a permissive road			0
