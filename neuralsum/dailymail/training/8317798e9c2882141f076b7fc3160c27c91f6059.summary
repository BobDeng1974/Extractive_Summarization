by @entity0 a @entity2 grandmother was allowed to come to @entity3 to live in a council house with her daughter who is an unemployed single mother - of - three living on benefits			2
@entity8 , 68 , was reunited with her daughter @entity9 , 43 , who claims £ 310 a week in handouts despite fears that she would also be a drain on taxpayers ' money			1
a relative promised to give the pensioner £ 100 a week so she did n't have to rely on benefits as well - but the tribunal heard he had just £ 1.15 in his bank account			1
hearing : the tribunal judge ruled that @entity8 , 68 could come to @entity3 to live with her daughter but despite this , judges in the @entity22 gave ms @entity8 permission to come to @entity3			1
they ruled that fellow @entity25 , 46 , who is a security guard earning £ 22,400 a year would do his best to support the family			0
the tribunal , sitting in @entity28 , heard that ms @entity8 will live rent free in her daughter 's council house with her three grandchildren			1
as mrs @entity9 was already living in a council house , the court ruled it would not cost the state any more to have her mother brought to @entity3 as well			0
mr justice @entity37 heard that the single mother receives £ 188 a month in child benefit for her three children , £ 101 income support and £ 165 per week in tax credits			0
despite mr @entity25 's lack of money they found ' there is a clear bond of mutual loyalty and support ' in @entity2 family culture and he could be depended on to provide money to the pensioner			0
if the security guard stops handing over £ 100 per week to the family , ms @entity8 will be forced to rely on state handouts			1
the tribunal was told that mr @entity25 had just £ 1.15 in his account because he had been sending money to his parents in @entity2			2
however , he had recently stopped as they had got jobs			0
the @entity63 argued that ms @entity8 should n't be allowed into the country because there was no evidence that the distant relative would actually hand over any money			1
a spokesman for the @entity63 said : ' we are disappointed with the judgment in this case , however we can only challenge decisions if an error of law is detected			0
in this case there were no grounds for further appeal			0
' we are clear that those who wish to make a life in the @entity3 with their family , work hard and make a contribution are welcome - but family life must not be established here at the @entity3 taxpayer 's expense			2

her daughter @entity9 claims £ 310 a week in state handouts
ms @entity8 was allowed to come to @entity3 after judge rules she wo n't be a drain on taxpayer 's money
