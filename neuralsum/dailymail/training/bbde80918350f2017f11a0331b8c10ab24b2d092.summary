pressure mounted on @entity1 to hold an independent inquiry into the @entity4 paedophilia scandal last night as @entity5 became the fourth @entity6 leader to deny knowledge of the abuse			1
opposition mps accused the deputy prime minister of putting up a smokescreen by claiming he knew nothing of @entity4 ’s vile activities because they occurred before his party existed in its current form			1
@entity5 , who led the @entity6 from 1988 to 1999 , yesterday insisted he did not know of the 29 - stone late @entity18 mp ’s serial abuse of boys while he was at @entity20			2
the @entity6 have been under attack for failing to recognise the @entity4 's serial sexual abuse of boys @entity5 was elected to @entity29 in 1983 and retired in 2001			1
@entity4 served as @entity18 and later @entity6 member for @entity31 from 1972 to 1992			2
this meant they would have been part of a small group of @entity18 or @entity36 for nine years			0
@entity5 told the @entity37 : ‘ you ask whether i was aware of allegations about @entity4 during the time you refer to			1
the answer is no. ’ mr @entity1 , former party leader @entity42 and @entity43 , who was acting leader for three months in 2007 , have already said they had no idea @entity4 was a predatory paedophile over four decades			1
but @entity49 , the current @entity50 mp for @entity31 whose explosive book serialised in the @entity37 last week revealed the scale of @entity4 ’s abuse , said the @entity6 still had questions to answer			1
‘ @entity1 needs to initiate an investigation into why the @entity18 or the @entity6 – call it what you want – had a paedophile at the heart of the party for at least 20 years , ’ he said			1
‘ it is just not good enough to say that nobody knew about this			0
‘ how can he say nobody knew when the reality is that former @entity18 mps , candidates , councillors and even the former leader of the party on @entity69 say they were all aware ? ’ mr @entity49 attacked mr @entity1 for attempting to shake off the scandal by saying the @entity6 , which came into being in 1988 , was separate from the old @entity18			1
he said : ‘ they are one and the same thing			0
using this argument gives the impression of a smokescreen , that @entity1 is distancing himself from what went on before			1
’ @entity50 mp @entity49 , left , attacked deputy prime minister @entity1 for attempting to shake off the scandal by saying the @entity6 , born in 1988 , was separate from the old @entity18 @entity80 , former @entity82 children ’s minister , said the number of unanswered questions was growing daily and added his voice to calls for a ‘ proper inquiry ’			1
‘ the more that comes out about this story , the more it ’s clear that a number of people knew something was wrong at the time , ’ he said			0
‘ suspicions about a cover - up grow			0
‘ the only way to assure the public that justice is being done to those victims is for everyone who knows anything to come forward before a formal inquiry , so that all possible lines can be followed to see who knew what when , and who needs to be held responsible for allowing @entity4 to get away with this for so long			2
’ monstrous cover - up : from the mail , april 11 the man who knew nothing : april 14 @entity6 alibis fall apart : april 15 the @entity114 used its leader column this week to criticise mr @entity1 ’s claim that nobody in his party was aware of the abuse as ‘ not good enough ’ and ‘ demonstrably not true ’			1
the paper said : ‘ what the @entity6 knew and when they knew it about @entity4 ’s assaults is a matter of urgent public interest and a gathering scandal			1
mr @entity1 ’s answers have so far been legalistic and unconvincing			2
’ the deputy prime minister paid tribute to @entity4 at his 80th birthday in 2008 , calling him a ‘ beacon ’ and an ‘ inspiration ’			2
last week he said @entity6 whips had contacted every current mp and peer and trawled through the party ’s archives after mr @entity49 exposed @entity4 ’s abuse in @entity29 in 2012			1
no one admitted hearing about the allegations – even though former @entity18 leader @entity25 was told in 1979 about complaints @entity4 had abused boys			1
@entity25 , who nominated @entity4 for a knighthood in 1988 , has not responded to the latest revelations about the scandal			1
he has previously said he received no complaints about @entity4 ’s activities as a @entity18 mp and that the obese politician denied any wrongdoing when he questioned him in 1979 about the allegations of ‘ unusual behaviour with boys ’			2
@entity152 , @entity82 mp for @entity153 , said the @entity6 should have pursued the allegations ‘ far more vigorously ’ , adding that a ‘ full - scale and properly resourced investigation is long overdue ’			0
a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ @entity4 ’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined			2
his actions were not known to or condoned by the @entity18 or the @entity6			0
‘ these are extremely serious allegations and include suggestions that there was a cover - up by the police and security services … such serious allegations … must be a matter for the police			0
’ for ten days the @entity37 has led the way in reporting how the @entity6 have gone into a state of denial about the appalling acts of sex abuse committed by mp @entity4 over four decades , exposed in our serialisation of @entity49 ’s book			2
initially , other media were reluctant to pursue the story , but on monday the @entity114 ran a leader comment on the affair headlined ‘ @entity184 ’			0
the following is an abridged version : when sir @entity4 died in 2010 , @entity1 described him as ‘ one of the most likeable politicians of his day ’			1
that depended on where you sat. vulnerable children whom @entity4 sexually abused over 40 years are unlikely to have shared mr @entity1 ’s judgment			1
what the @entity6 knew and when they knew it about @entity4 ’s assaults is a matter of urgent public interest and a gathering scandal			1
mr @entity1 ’s answers have so far been legalistic and unconvincing			2
@entity4 ’s covert life as a paedophile has emerged into the public spotlight in the past week owing to a new book co-authored by @entity49			2
it expands upon allegations mr @entity49 made in the @entity207 in 2012			0
yet it is literally incredible that the party in which @entity4 was a huge figure should have been uniformly unaware of them			1
mr @entity1 said last week that his party had been unaware of this appalling history , and added : ‘ many of the actions , the repugnant actions , which we now learn about took place well before the party i now lead even existed — in fact , took place before i even existed			1
’ that is a casuistical distinction between the @entity6 and the old liberal party			0
nor is the claim of ignorance plausible			0
@entity4 had been chief whip of the @entity225 ’ very small parliamentary presence in the 1970s			2
despite a mass of corroborating evidence … he was knighted in 1988 and retired as an mp in 1992			0
he continued to abuse children as late as the 1990s			0
since @entity4 ’s death , the @entity230 has admitted culpability in failing to prosecute him			0
mr @entity1 correctly says the police will need to investigate what happened			0
he and his colleagues also need to exercise historical accountability , however , and explain how @entity4 got away with a catalogue of depravity			0
there is a terrible parallel with the activities of @entity242 , the entertainer now known to have been a prolific child abuser			0
@entity242 and @entity4 operated in , respectively , the @entity244 and the @entity6 , which celebrated their fame till their deaths and afterwards			0
mr @entity1 must account for how this happened			0
it is not good enough , for it is demonstrably not true , to maintain that nobody knew .			0

opposition mps accuse @entity1 of putting up smokescreen over the scandal
@entity256 has said @entity4 's abuses were before his party existed in current form
comes after @entity5 becomes latest former leader to deny knowing
