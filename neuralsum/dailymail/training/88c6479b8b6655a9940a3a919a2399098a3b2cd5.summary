@entity1 winger @entity0 has successfully appealed against the red card he was shown against @entity3 on @entity4 and will face no further punishment			1
@entity0 was sent off for his reaction to a strong tackle from @entity8 in the 86th minute of the 1 - 1 draw , with @entity8 booked for the challenge			1
the dismissal had left @entity12 facing a three - match ban but that has been lifted after his appeal was upheld			2
' @entity0 was dismissed during his side ’s 1 - 1 draw against @entity3 on @entity4 for violent conduct			2
' the three - match suspension has therefore been withdrawn with immediate effect			2
' @entity0 reacts after @entity8 ( floor ) had dived in recklessly to challenge on him @entity0 ’s red card was one of a number of decisions from referee @entity18 which upset @entity1 - as @entity3 goalkeeper @entity35 should have been sent off for handling outside his area early in the match			1
@entity39 boss @entity38 described @entity8 ’s challenge on @entity0 as a ' leg - breaker ' and said the officials were mistaken in believing @entity0 had kicked out in response			1
' it ’s a leg breaker , ' @entity38 said			2
' i think everyone knew in the stadium apart from the official and then the double whammy of our player getting sent off for apparently kicking out			0
@entity1 striker @entity52 consoles @entity0 after he is sent off by @entity18 ' he does n’t kick out at all			1
i just hope justice is done not just for us but for football in itself			0
' i ’m losing a bit of faith			0
it ’s hard for us to keep faith when we continually have decisions like this , big moments within games			0
' that sounds like me moaning , i ’m not at all			0
i ’m just telling you the facts			0
@entity1 manager @entity38 ( second left ) was furious with the decision to show the red card ' i hope the red card gets rescinded because that will 100 per cent be the right thing to happen			1
' we ’ll be appealing for sure			0
my player goes from nearly having his leg broken to getting sent off , i do n’t see how that can happen			0
' despite the red card , @entity1 mustered a stoppage - time leveller through @entity52 , cancelling out @entity77 ’s strike for the hosts .			1

@entity0 given red card for reacting to @entity8 challenge
@entity1 manager @entity38 *criticised* referee @entity18
