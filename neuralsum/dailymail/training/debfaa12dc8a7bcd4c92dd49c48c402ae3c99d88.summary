but after suffering a serious concussion from falling down a flight of stairs , she has now suddenly gained the ability to draw beautiful works of art. before and after : @entity19 struggled to draw even simple images before the accident ( left ) , but is now being commissioned to produce portraits and drawings ( right ) miss @entity6 discovered a new - found artistic ability after hitting her head when she fell down some stairs she now draws up to four pictures a day and , after seeing her work , strangers have even commissioned her to produce pieces for them			1
miss @entity6 said : ' it is just extraordinary and quite strange really			1
i have always loved drawing and had hopes of becoming an artist as a teenager but i was never any good			1
' i used to draw cartoons and the only thing i could really manage was @entity39			1
' i studied art at school and wanted to take it as an @entity43 , but my teacher advised me not to as i really was n’t very good			1
' i dug out my old notepad from when i was 16 and cringed at my attempts of drawing people and faces			2
' miss @entity6 can now copy almost any image and specialises in portaits , such as this one of actor @entity53 while she struggles to produce pictures from her imagination , she can copy any image almost perfectly she noticed the new talent when she picked up a pencil to do a doodle while recovering from her head injuries miss @entity6 suffered serious bruising to her brain after she tripped and fell down a flight of steps as she visited the racecourse in @entity66 with a friend in may 2012			1
she said : ' i fell at the top of a flight of stone steps and hit the right - hand side of my head			1
' i was rushed to hospital by ambulance and came to a couple of hours later , unsure of where i was			0
' miss @entity6 is now compelled to draw every day and worries if she does n’t draw she will lose her new talent over night - as quickly as she discovered it			1
she added : ' i have always loved being artistic - even though it did n’t come naturally to me			0
' when i was recovering and resting at home i decided to pick up a pencil and start sketching			0
' i started doodling but something felt different			0
it was more natural and i was amazed at the images i could draw			2
' it is a talent i developed over night			2
my sister jokes that she wants a bang on the head so she can wake up with a talent			1
' miss @entity6 was left with bad bruising and suffered concussion and she was told it would take her six months to recover			1
since her fall , miss @entity6 has developed a skill for animal portraits , and can produced detailed sketches of dogs and pets miss @entity6 suffered serious bruising to her brain after she tripped and fell down a flight of steps at @entity104 her biggest fear is that she will suddenly lose her new talent as quickly as she discovered it she said : ' i found myself sat at home recovering and i was bored			1
i had n’t drawn for years but i bought a 2b pencil and a sketch pad and tried drawing			0
' it felt really natural in a way it had n’t before and i saw things in a different light			0
i began to realise i had a real skill in being able to copy things accurately			0
' miss @entity6 ’s brain does n’t allow her to create her own images in her imagination , but she can copy objects , people and photographs perfectly			1
she said : ' although i ’d been told there was no lasting damage , to me something had changed			0
' in my mind , i ’m simply copying the images and my drawings are identical to the originals			0
miss @entity6 is one a handful of people around the world who have suffered a brain injury or head trauma and later woke up with amazing musical , artistic or mathematical abilities , known as @entity138			1
while research into the cause is ongoing , there is no single theory explaining all savants			0
many researchers believe the underlying cause occurs when one side of the brain compensates for an injury to the other			0
@entity151 psychiatrist @entity150 thinks certain injuries cause the brain to ' rewire ' itself , unlocking new abilities			2
in a study into the condition , he said : ' what happens is that there is injury , then there is the recruitment of other still - intact tissue			2
' there is rewiring [ of brain signals ] through that intact tissue , and then there is the release of dormant potential within that brain area			0
' other cases include @entity172 ( pictured ) , a teenager from @entity173 , @entity174 in the @entity151 , who became a musical genius after hitting his head playing lacrosse			2
despite being tone deaf before the accident and being unable to read music , he later taught himself how to play 13 different instruments			0
another @entity151 youngster , 10 - year - old @entity182 found he could perfectly remember each day 's weather after being hit on the head with a baseball			1
and @entity187 , also from the @entity151 , became a master pianist at the age of 40 after injuring himself diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool			0
despite miss @entity6 's fears she 'll lose her new talent , doctors say it is extremely rare for a savant to lose their skills after they have acquired them			1
miss @entity6 mainly draws animals and pet portraits and her favourite part to draw are the eyes			1
she added : ' i get such a pleasure from my art. my brain injury changed my life and i am just so glad that i have this positive talent from it			2
' i do n’t want to over-analyse how this has happened and i am terrified of losing my skill and i am living my dream			0
' i draw as much as i can and i am truly grateful for this side effect of my brain injury			2
' @entity214 , spokesman for brain injury association @entity215 , said : ' our brains are capable of incredible things and while today we know so much more than we used to , there is still much to learn about the brain			0
' the effects of brain injury can be devastating , but we know that with the right help , at the right time , there can be life after brain injury			0
' at @entity215 , we encourage people to try arts and crafts , gardening , music and other activities that they may not have tried before their brain injuries			2
' activities like these can have multiple benefits including increasing confidence and improving hand - to - eye co-ordination			0
' while different parts of our brain are responsible for different things , all parts of the brain are interconnected			0
' inhibition in one part of the brain following injury can lead to increased activity in other parts of the brain , which can sometimes result in surprising and unexpected effects			0
' it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons behind @entity6 's fabulous new - found artistic ability but we are delighted she is enjoying her new hobby			1
