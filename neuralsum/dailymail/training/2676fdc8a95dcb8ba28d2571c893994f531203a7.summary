there is the @entity2 diet , the @entity4 diet , the 5:2 diet and countless other cunning plans which offer you that shimmering mirage of the perfect bikini body			2
the low - carb diet was basically ‘ goodbye , spuds , rice and bread ’			1
the @entity16 diet meant lots of grilled fish and olive oil and playing @entity20 on the cd player			2
the tapeworm diet involved swallowing a tapeworm which — so the highly implausible theory went — would gobble up some of your spare calories from the inside			2
it seems amazing anyone fell for that one			2
political heavyweight : @entity32 ( left ) as he was when he served in @entity34 's administration and as he is now ( right ) to these weight - loss fads we can now add the @entity37 , named in honour of a former lord chancellor , @entity32 , who in the past ten months has shed 5st , nearly a third of his old weight			1
the politician formerly nicknamed ‘ @entity42 is a porker no more			2
his lordship , who served in the @entity46 when his former flatmate @entity34 was prime minister , was 16½st two years ago			2
today , after a routine of one meal a day ( dinner ) , the @entity49 peer is down to 11st 5lb			1
his regime included some nine cans of @entity56 a day and lots of fruit			1
he seems to have devoured as many apples as a much - patted @entity60 at the local pony club			1
even as the news was being reported yesterday , less - than - slender @entity62 were no doubt wobbling off to the supermarket to stock up on apples and @entity56			1
the @entity37 - up to nine cans of @entity56 a day and as many apples as you want is n’t that the way with diets ? the copycat mentality takes a grip and suddenly we are all after grapefruits or lemonade or whatever the ‘ new secret cure ’ for tubbiness might be			1
a few years ago it was cabbage soup			0
remember that ? the offices of @entity62 started ponging like boarding - school corridors			1
i have sometimes wondered if the cabbage soup diet was an enormous practical joke , devised to get the whole country parping away like @entity90 ’s little car			1
so what is the biggest lesson we should draw from the ‘ @entity32 diet ’ ? before the whole world goes mad and some publisher commissions him to write the latest diet book for the post-christmas market , the basic truth of his remarkable weight loss was this : he stopped gorging			1
he also went on five - mile runs most days			1
and he gave up alcohol			0
quite a sacrifice , for the old @entity32 was a notably convivial fellow , a falstaffian figure with a voice that gurgled agreeably as the @entity109 went down his capacious gullet			1
he was , by his own admission , practically the only new @entity49 grandee who would booze at lunchtime			0
at times , it was as though he — perhaps along with his former @entity46 colleague @entity118 — was trying to make up for the rest of the abstemious @entity121 crew			0
then @entity32 looked at himself last december and realised he had to alter his ways — or face problems such as diabetes and heart disease			1
and so he took control of his appetite			0
you could almost say he became a bit obsessive about it			0
was there maybe something a little bit typically male in that ? men love to follow orders , be decisive , smite the table and say : ‘ right , this is the way it ’s going to be from now on ! ’ lord @entity140 as he was before he wrote the @entity141 ( left ) and as he is now ( right ) , twenty years later , having kept the weight off @entity32 ’s inspiration was former @entity144 chancellor @entity140 , another one - time chubster who went on a dramatic weight - loss plan of his own devising ( and got a publishing deal out of it )			1
lord @entity140 also shed 5st , in part by giving up @entity151 , replacing butter with lemon juice , and exercising , yes , willpower			1
when it comes to dieting , are women not prone to a certain amount of wishful thinking ? i know that i tread , here , in a minefield			0
dieting ladies can be snappy , their sense of humour worn thin ( dread word ) by disgusting skinny noodles , low - cal nutrition bars that taste of cardboard and mix - in - a - cup lentil soups with the consistency of washing - up liquid			1
one generalises at one ’s peril , but there is a gender difference when it comes to dieting			1
they stand on the bathroom scales in the morning and greet each lost pound with a @entity182 grunt of triumph			1
they regard flab as a challenge			0
they come over all macho about going without elevenses , saying : ‘ the @entity190 go days without eating when they ’re on manoeuvres			1
’ how does a woman approach the endeavour ? her methods are gentler			0
she negotiates with her grumbling tummies			0
she makes deals : a chocolate bar at the end of a virtuous day , an almond croissant to keep a non-dieting friend company ( ‘ because i do n’t want her to feel bad ’ )			0
before you rush to tick me off , there are scientific studies to support this			0
one school of thought says higher levels of oestrogen cause women to form an emotional attachment to certain foods , making it harder to give them up without some degree of regret			0
they are more likely to ‘ comfort eat ’ than men			0
men , meanwhile , tend to have more natural muscle mass than women , and it is muscle that helps burn more calories when exercising			0
so men are more likely to see the immediate effects of diet and activity and feel spurred on			0
with women , the weight is slower to shift and the lack of immediate progress demoralising — and cause for a consoling violet cream			1
having been on the portly side since childhood , i was put on my first diet when i was 12			0
my mother , having read something in the newspapers , announced that i would be going on a ‘ steak diet ’			0
she even bought me a special sharp knife with which to eat the steaks that were going to transform me from @entity243 to a drainpipe			0
alas , steak was a little beyond her shopping budget , so i ended up being given @entity248 steak burgers , which were rather less slimming than a butcher ’s sirloin might have been			1
then some fool wrote an article about how cheese was good for slimming , so i was given hunks of cheddar to go with my burger			0
inevitably , my trousers became only tighter			0
my wife is an exception to the rule that women talk about losing weight , let you know they are on a strict regimen — then have a bar of chocolate each evening before bed			1
i do n’t know if she will thank me for saying this , but my wife diets like a bloke			1
a couple of years ago , she announced her intention to begin going to a @entity274 dance class			0
the weight started falling off , she lost 2st and looked ( and looks still ) super			1
one day , she cast a leathery glance at my gut and left it to be understood that a little regime might be in order for me , too			0
any thought of joining the @entity282 ladies at a @entity274 class in my mankini was beyond the pale , but i pretty much gave up white flour , particularly bread , and managed to lose a stone - and - a - half			2
it has stayed off , happily , because being a chap i have the willpower to keep it that way			0
but i do n’t intend , just yet , to do a @entity140 or @entity32			1
lord @entity140 was unrecognisable after he went from 17st to 12st			1
it is almost as difficult today to recognise @entity32			1
the old @entity295 has been replaced by someone who could be the brother of football manager @entity297			0
he is wrinkled , flashes a not entirely convincing smile and poses in a pair of lean - guy denim trousers			2
mister fitness ! but the voice has maybe lost some of its bonhomie and there is something spare , something missing , in his parliamentary personality these days			2
he is not the man he was			0
professional dietitians were already tutting yesterday when they examined his weight - loss strategy			1
they deplored the fact that he ate no breakfast , and said we are healthier if we have something in our stomachs at the start of the day			2
they were twitchy about all those cans of @entity323			0
most of all , though , i suspect they may have been uneasy that @entity32 had proved that the most effective way of slimming is simply cutting back on the nosebag			1
he is not the first to have done this			0
ten years ago my friend @entity330 , an 18st parliamentary sketch writer , lost more than 5½ st in 40 days			2
it was like watching air go out of a lilo			0
how did he do it ? he limited himself to 200 calories a day , drinking only water			0
back then , too , the professionals from the multi-million - pound diet industry were appalled			2
how could they make money out of their diet books , diet cds and diet dvds if some maniac showed that eating very much less is the surest way to lose weight ? for that , i ’m afraid , is the cold truth of the matter			1
@entity356 , @entity357 , dooby - doo - woo			2
if it ’s a smaller dress size you ’re after , ladies , there is no alternative but to stop scoffing so much , stop boozing and buy some running shoes			2
in short : approach your weight loss like a man !			2

of all the *exotic* diets out there , eating less works by far the best
@entity32 ate apples and drank @entity56 until dinner time
@entity32 ’s inspiration was former @entity144 chancellor @entity140
@entity140 , another one - time chubster , lost 5stone and kept weight off
