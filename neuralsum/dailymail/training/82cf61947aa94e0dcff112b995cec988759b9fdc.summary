the eye - watering sum was revealed by @entity3 's grey - haired accountant @entity10 during two hours of questioning as the trial of the sleazy politician who is accused of paying for sex with a minor continues			1
prosecutors believe dozens of women were given money , cars and jewellery in return for spending the night with him and in return for attending his bunga bunga parties			1
prosecutors believe dozens of women were given money , cars and jewellery in return for spending the night with @entity3 ( above ) and in return for attending his bunga bunga parties the trial has already heard how women dressed as nuns and police officers before carrying out seductive pole dances for @entity3 and two of his cronies			1
the venue for the parties was the basement in the billionaire media tycoon 's villa at @entity41 near @entity42 and mr @entity10 told the court how he brought the money to the house from his office over a period between 2009 and 2010			1
as prosecutors showed him a long list of bankers drafts and withdrawals from the former prime minister 's accounts mr @entity10 said : ' i was just following the orders of @entity3			1
every slip had to be personally signed by him and i would then take the money to @entity41			2
' one of the young women who attended @entity3 's parties told the court that she dressed up as a burlesque version of @entity63 president @entity62 to entertain the former @entity65 prime minister			1
@entity66 also said she had dressed as prosecutor @entity67			2
@entity67 , known as ' @entity68 ' because of her hair colour and what @entity3 says is her communist political sympathies , is one of the prosecutors in the ongoing trial			2
' i dressed up as @entity67 with a toga to make him laugh , and also as @entity62 , ' @entity66 told the court			1
@entity66 , a striking 28 - year - old from the @entity78 , said the parties were innocent fun accompanied by burlesque , but not pornographic , entertainment			1
he had a close rapport with former @entity63 president @entity85 , earning several invitations to @entity87 and even to his @entity89 ranch , but he never was able to establish a similar relationship with @entity62 after repeatedly describing him - and later his wife - as ' suntanned '			1
' during the week the girls would speak to me and tell me what they needed and then on a monday i would go to @entity41 where i had a meeting with him ( @entity3 ) and he would tell me what amounts to put in the envelopes			0
' he asked me to bring the money in cash and i would put it in the safe at the villa			0
in 2009 i brought around € 7,665,000 while in 2010 i brought more than € 12 million			0
' whenever large sums were needed i would forewarn the bank and they would break it down into smaller amounts for me			0
the money was for the girls daily living expenses and for bills , that sort of thing			0
we helped so many people and we still do			0
' some of these girls had come from overseas and had nothing			0
' @entity3 is accused of paying for sex with underage minor @entity120 , also known as @entity122 , in february 2010 when she was just 17 years old and therefore technically a minor			1
in @entity65 the age of consent is 14 but paying a woman under 18 for sex is seen as prostitution with a minor and punishable by up to three years in jail			1
mr @entity10 said : ' i gave her less than € 10,000 , probably around € 8,900			0
one day she came to my office and her face was @entity134 bruised and she said her flatmate had beaten her up so i gave her € 3,000			0
' another time after i had spoken to @entity3 about her , i gave her € 5,000 and i think on two other occasions when she turned up at my office unannounced i gave her between € 100 and € 300			0
' earlier the court had heard from another witness @entity139 , a guest at the parties , who described how @entity3 had ' paid numerous girls for sex ' after an evening at the villa			1
@entity3 is accused of paying for sex with underage minor @entity120 , also known as @entity122 , in february 2010 when she was just 17 years old she told the hearing of one evening in january 2011 and said : ' @entity3 paid numerous girls for sex			1
there was about 20 girls , some were in swimming costumes and others were in their underwear			0
' i did n't see anyone completely naked and there were only three men present @entity158 ( tv news anchorman ) and @entity160 ( @entity3 's singing partner on their album ) who sang and played his guitar			2
' ms @entity139 added : ' at the end of the evening some girls left but around half of the women , around ten or so , stayed			0
i left , i chose not to stay and a driver took me home			0
it was my choice , i was n't specifically asked if i wanted to have sex but when i accepted the invitation i knew what was expected of me			2
if i had wanted to , i could have stayed			0
' my friend @entity173 stayed the night and she told me that she had sex with @entity3 in return for money but he did n't just pay for sex with money he also paid the rent for some of the girls as well in return			2
he paid for @entity173 's rent			2
' she said : ' the girls were all semi naked			0
we were in the bunga bunga room as it was called in the basement			1
they would perform erotic dances and the prime minister would touch them			0
i was a little bit upset after the party because i did n't get an envelope like the other girls			0
' @entity3 has insisted that nothing untoward happened at the parties which were simply ' elegant dinners ' and belly dancer miss @entity120 , who he is accused of paying for under age sex with , has also insisted that nothing happened between them			1
@entity3 is also accused of abuse of office , with prosecutors claiming he had @entity120 freed from police custody when she was arrested for theft by wrongly telling officers she was related to the then @entity212 president @entity211 .			2
