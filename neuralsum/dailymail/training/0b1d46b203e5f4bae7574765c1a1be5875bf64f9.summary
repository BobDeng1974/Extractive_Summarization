by @entity0 people are more likely to die at @entity3 than at any other time of the year , a study shows			0
@entity6 researchers examined death certificates and discovered that people have the highest chance of death on christmas day , @entity11 and @entity12			1
they found this to be true of people who died of natural causes including circulatory problems , respiratory disease and cancer			1
people are more likely to die at @entity3 than at any other time of year - and the figures hold true for all age groups except children the researchers , from the @entity27 , say the figures hold true for people of all ages , except for children , @entity25 reports			1
a study conducted in @entity33 this year also revealed people taken to hospital as an emergency on @entity3 are more likely to die than they would be on other days , including weekends			0
the researchers , led by @entity39 , a professor of sociology , do not know exactly why people are more likely to die over @entity3			2
however , there are many theories			0
some believe it could be because people experience more stress and , sometimes , more sadness at @entity3			2
@entity49 , an obituary writer , told @entity25 : ‘ we are always getting a slew of obits this time of year			0
i noticed this happened pretty regularly so i did call around to funeral directors to see if they believed there was an uptick too			0
people are most likely to die on christmas day , @entity11 or @entity12 ‘ i 've written many stories about a spouse or a partner dying and then you see the remaining partner die within hours or days or weeks or months			1
to me there seems to be a correlation between body and mind here			0
’ dr @entity39 studied deaths among people with @entity68 ’s			2
he found there were more cardiac - associated deaths during the @entity3 holidays and believes this could be triggered by stress in people with dementia who tend to be distressed by changes to routine			1
in a bid to look for other explanations for the increased festive death rate , dr @entity39 decided to investigate whether cold weather was to blame			1
researchers believe the most likely explanation for the increase in death rates at @entity3 is reduced access to healthcare to his surprise , he discovered the increase in cardiac - related deaths at @entity3 is lower in cold @entity6 states bordering @entity91 than in those that border the @entity94			1
the team then decided to look at whether festive eating and drinking was responsible			0
but they also had to discount this theory as deaths among hospital inpatients also went up even though their diet and alcohol consumption is regulated			2
the researchers were also surprised to find that the number of suicides is lowest in december and that homicide rates also drop			1
as a result , dr @entity39 believes the real reason for the peak in deaths is related to the availability of healthcare			2
he believes some people put off visiting a doctor during the festivities and that some hospitals have fewer staff at @entity3 , increasing the death risk			2
he bases this theory on the fact that the increase in death rates is particularly significant in patients admitted to trauma centres as emergencies			1
he told @entity25 : ‘ for those deaths , the spike was even sharper			0
those are the cases where seconds make a difference and you may see a real difference between the response of a junior and senior member of staff			0
’ the news comes just days after experts at @entity139 revealed the number of people suffering from heart problems increases at @entity3			0
they say the number of both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks increases , as does the number of people suffering from irregular heartbeats , @entity146 reports			0
this trend could be caused by stress , cold weather or overindulgence , they speculate .			1

highest death rates are on christmas day , @entity11 and @entity12
includes increase in deaths from cancer and circulatory problems
the figures hold true for all age groups except for children
trend could be caused by stress , overindulgence or cold weather
but , researchers think it *'s* most likely to be *due* to reduced access to healthcare and short staffed hospitals
