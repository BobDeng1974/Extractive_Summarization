in a throwback to the colour - changing mood rings and @entity5 t - shirts of the 1990s , a @entity1 bodyshop has taken it a step further by creating a colour - changing car			1
using @entity10 , a video shows the @entity12 - based experts from @entity13 pouring cold water over an orange @entity15			1
wherever the water hits the car , the bodywork appears to change from orange to purple			2
when cold water is poured onto it , the car changes colour			1
the paint is what 's called thermochromatic			1
as the temperature goes up , the pigment in the paint becomes colourless , revealing the base coat underneath @entity34 paint contains pigments that change from one colour to another as the temperature changes			1
there are two types of thermochromatic pigments : liquid crystals and leuco dyes			1
liquid crystals are more accurate in detecting temperature changes , but have a limited colour range			2
@entity46 dyes come in more colours , but can only show ' hot ' or ' cold '			0
pigments used in the @entity10 are made from leuco dyes			1
the dye is n't applied to the car directly ; it is in sold in the form of microcapsules with the mixture sealed inside			0
@entity5 tshirts , mood rings and @entity58 state indicators all use thermochratic dyes			0
the paint is what 's called thermochromatic , which means it changes from one colour to another when the temperature changes			1
as the temperature goes up , the pigment in the paint becomes colourless , revealing the base coat underneath			1
the reactive element is suspended in either water or solvent based - paint and must be applied in such a way to make sure the particles spread across the entire surface			0
@entity22 applied the base coat under a layer of clear paint			1
its reactive paint costs £ 199 per litre and the bodyshop used around 7.5 litres on its @entity15			2
the base colour of the car stays hidden by the effect paint when it is cold , but is revealed when the car heats up again			1
the paint comes in different colours and they can be combined with existing car colours , and top coats , to make the effect more personalised			0
@entity34 paint contains pigments that change from one colour to another as the temperature changes			2
there are two types of thermochromic pigments : liquid crystals and leuco dyes			0
liquid crystals are more accurate in detecting temperature changes but have a limited colour range			0
there are two types of thermochromatic pigments : liquid crystals and leuco dyes			1
@entity5 t - shirts , left , mood rings , right , and @entity58 battery state indicators use thermochratic pigments			0
the dye is n't applied to the item directly ; it is in sold in the form of microcapsules with the mixture sealed inside			0
@entity46 dyes come in more colours , but can only show ' hot ' or ' cold '			0
these are the pigments used in the paint			0
the dye is n't applied to the car directly ; it is in sold in the form of microcapsules with the mixture sealed inside			0
however , because cars spend a lot of time exposed to uv light , the paint is said to only last between four and six months			0
@entity22 said a uv additive can be bought to protect the car and extend the life of the heat reactive element			2
the reactive element is supplied suspended in either a water or solvent base			0
@entity22 applied the base coat under a layer of clear paint			1
its paint costs £ 199 per litre and the bodyshop used around 7.5 litres on the @entity15			2

video shows @entity15 changing colour as water is poured over it
the @entity10 was added to the car by @entity1 bodyshop @entity22
it contains so - called thermochromatic pigments that react to temperature
when the car heats up pigments become colourless to reveal the base coat
