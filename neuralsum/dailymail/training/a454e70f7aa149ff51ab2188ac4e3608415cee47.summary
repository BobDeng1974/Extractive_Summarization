@entity0 somehow turned what looked like being a victory over @entity3 into a @entity5 quarter - final defeat on friday			1
the @entity6 lost a tight opener on the tie - break and appeared set to bow out at the quarter - final stage when he offered up two break points at 4 - 4 in the second			1
he hung tough to save his serve , though , and then broke the @entity13 - conqueror of @entity14 on thursday - before running away into a 3 - 0 lead in the decider			1
but he inexplicably crumbled , losing five games in a row before slumping to a 7 - 6 4 - 6 6 - 4 loss			1
looking up : @entity0 had looked to be in control after winning the second set but he let his third - set lead slip powering on : @entity3 was eventually able to beat the @entity6 in three sets in a pulsating clash in @entity25 he was visibly frustrated as his chances disappeared in front of him , with @entity3 deserving immense credit for his fightback			1
the see - saw nature of the second and third sets was entirely out of keeping with the opener which @entity3 won on a tie - break after 12 consecutive holds of serve			2
he got ahead in the breaker when @entity0 hit a forehand long			0
the pair traded breaks early in the second set and @entity0 then looked set for straight - sets exit when he offered up two more break points			2
he found a way to save them , however , and then broke himself before winning the set to love			0
he carried that confidence into the decider and was soon 3 - 0 ahead as @entity3 got erratic , before the tables turned dramatically			1
getting into the swing : @entity0 has played well at times in the tournament as he gears up for the @entity50 ' i had to play around my return position quite a lot , and i started to get into more service games in the second and third set , ' @entity0 told atp.com after the match			2
' i thought it was a high - level match with a few games by both of us in the second and third sets that were a bit scrappy			0
' @entity3 is a top player			0
he 's a fantastic athlete			0
when his game is on , he 's very tough to beat			0
