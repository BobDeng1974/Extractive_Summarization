@entity1 experts have found evidence that large - scale asteroids have struck @entity4 three to ten times more often over the past decade than previously thought			0
the evidence , which will presented by three former @entity1 employees , including two astronauts , will reveal the full extent of the explosions which they claim have shaken countries across the world			1
at the event , experts will announce that the only thing ' preventing a city - killer size asteroid is blind luck '			1
next week , @entity1 astronauts will reveal the full extent of the explosions which have shaken countries across the world the presentation , due to be held the same day as @entity30 , which reminds people of the importance of protecting the environment , will reveal the findings of the nuclear weapons warning network			1
asteroids are sometimes referred to as small planets and there are believed to millions in the solar system			0
they are solid and formed of rock - like material , thought to have been left over from the time the planets were first formed			0
the group says that since 2001 it has detected 26 explosions , which it claims are down to asteroids hitting the planet			1
the only reason , the group claims , that the explosions have not been in the public eye is because they have taken place in remote locations			1
@entity51 revealed that the group , named @entity53 , will present its findings at @entity56 's @entity55			1
the @entity58 meteorite contrail was seen in the sky above the @entity61 city			0
the meteor injured hundreds of people the meteorite left a 20 - foot hole in a frozen lake where it fell outside the city of @entity58 in @entity61 a recent press release from the foundation 's ceo , @entity72 , a physicist who worked for @entity1 until 2007 , states : ' this network has detected 26 multi-kiloton explosions since 2001 , all of which are due to asteroid impacts			1
' it shows that asteroid impacts are not rare â€” but actually three to 10 times more common than we previously thought			1
' the fact that none of these asteroid impacts shown in the video was detected in advance is proof that the only thing preventing a catastrophe from a ' city - killer ' sized asteroid is blind luck			1
the goal of the @entity94 mission is to find and track asteroids decades before they hit @entity4 , allowing us to easily deflect them			0
' an illustration of an asteroid heading towards @entity4			1
one asteroid , believed to have hit @entity4 3.26 billion years ago , was 36 miles wide , which scientists said was six times bigger than the blast which wiped out dinosaurs mr @entity72 will present the findings with @entity106 astronaut @entity105 and apollo 8 astronaut @entity107			2
most of the recorded asteroid impacts happened millions of years ago			2
one asteroid , believed to have hit @entity4 3.26 billion years ago , was 36 miles wide , which scientists said was six times bigger than the blast which wiped out dinosaurs			2
researchers said that the impact of the asteroid would have boiled oceans , burned the sky , and caused the planet to shake for 30 minutes			2
more recently , in february 2013 , an asteorid , believed to have been 19 - metres wide and weighing 100,000 tonnes , hit the province of @entity121 in @entity61 injuring hundreds of people			0
the asteroid was the biggest to have hit @entity4 in 100 years			2
in february 2014 , a 270 metre asteroid , the size of three football pitches , also sped past the earth			0
in 1998 film @entity128 , featuring @entity130 and @entity131 , @entity131 , plays a @entity1 astronaut who sacrifices his life to plant a bomb on an asteroid so that it does not hit the planet			0
the asteroid , which is the size of @entity138 in the film , would obliterate the @entity4 and all of its inhabitants			0

group claims that 26 asteroid explosions have occurred since 2001
@entity150 ' not rare ' but have *fallen* in remote locations , group says
*revelations* will be made next week in @entity56 by @entity154
