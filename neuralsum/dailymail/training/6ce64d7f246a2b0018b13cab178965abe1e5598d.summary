every girl wants a gorgeously kissable plump pout , and whatever the size or shape of your lips , it 's easier to achieve than you think			2
everyone 's been talking about @entity9 's full - lipped look recently , which she puts down to ' clever make - up '			1
so this week i 've enlisted the help of top make - up artist @entity14 , who taught me a quick and easy way to fake fuller - looking lips , using a bit of cosmetic trickery			1
keep your lips moisturised by using a good quality lip balm daily – my favourite is the @entity39 pharmacy classic @entity40			2
it offers intensive moisture , keeping lips looking smooth and feeling ultra-hydrated – not to mention its utterly delectable honey scent ! step 2 – lined lips firstly , take a lip pencil in a shade slightly warmer than your natural lip colour – i 've gone for @entity52 in @entity53 – and frame the outline of your lips to give them dimension and shape			1
@entity9 revealed recently that her fuller looking lips were down to nothing more than ' clever make - up ' @entity23 sees if she can achieve the same effect take the pencil just outside your natural lip line to create a trick of shadow , making your lip shape appear fuller			1
once you 're happy with the shape you 've outlined , gently blend the pencil inwards into your lips with a small brush so the effect remains natural looking			0
focus the lipliner on the outer corners of your lips to ensure the centre of your pout looks as full as possible			0
feel free to reinforce the line with another layer of pencil after blending until you achieve the desired fullness			0
step 3 – trick of light next , apply a very light pink - toned lip pencil – or a cream concealer such as @entity86 in @entity83 – onto the central area of your upper and lower lips , making sure not to go over the lip line you 've already applied			1
this sneaky trick creates the illusion of light and will make your pout look extra plump			0
similarly , adding a touch of pearlescent highlighter such as @entity98 to your @entity100 's bow will further accentuate your pout			0
step 4 – add @entity101 lighter lip colours close to your natural lip shade tend to work better than darker hues when it comes to faking fuller lips – think peachy nudes , pinks and browns			1
@entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 in @entity113 and @entity114 in @entity115 are three of my favourite lippy options for creating a plumped - up pout			0
@entity23 recommends using a concealer in order to create an illusion of light using a small lip brush , apply your chosen lip colour onto the lips			2
blend the light concealer in the centre outwards slightly – without totally covering it – so it merges seamlessly into your lips			0
this should result in a natural looking yet gorgeously voluptuous pout ! step 5 – get glossy finally , if you want to go all out , there 's no better product to add volume to the lips than a plumping gloss			1
@entity140 in @entity139 provides the perfect shimmering veil to complement your plumper pout , imparting spectacular shine while instantly adding volume to the lips with its expert plumping formulation			0
what 's more , it does n't leave your lips feeling sticky or gloopy like some glosses can – plus its fruity flavour will leave your pout feeling deliciously kissable as well as looking plumped - up to the max. all the products used to create my plump pout this week are available at @entity160			2
you can really have fun with these tips , trying out different products , shades and textures for a wealth of lip looks			0
remember though , make - up exists to enhance the natural beauty you already have – so do n't go overboard ! @entity23 says that although you are trying to make your lips look bigger try not to go over board , enhance your natural features rather than get too carried away @entity23 's best : date night @entity176 colours until next time , @entity23 xxx			1
