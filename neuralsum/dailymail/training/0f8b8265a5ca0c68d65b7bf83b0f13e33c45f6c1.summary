master sergeant @entity7 was using the motorized , standing scooter to help him get around due to injuries he sustained while at war			1
while serving in @entity4 , master sgt. @entity7 was shot four times			1
devalued : master sgt. @entity7 became a hero when he took four bullets for his country in @entity4 , but was kicked out of a mall for riding a segway that helped with his injuries the @entity21 recipient subsequently spent several months in the hospital recovering from his injuries and continues to experience chronic nerve pain in his legs that hinders his mobility			1
‘ if i walk long distances ’ @entity7 told @entity26 , ‘ my leg will start hurting			2
my sciatic nerve was severed , and i ca n't go long distances			1
i need to take a break			0
’ one way he can rest his legs is by using his segway in favor of walking , but that was one breaking a mall security guard was n’t willing to give			1
as @entity7 made his way through the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 , a guard stopped him			2
ongoing : @entity7 's still experiences severe pain and is about to have another surgery to help him get around more easily pulled over : despite his pleas and legal use of the @entity48 , the mall maintained @entity7 was ' speeding ' and causing a hazard to other customers ‘ [ @entity51 ] said i was going to have to take out the @entity48 , ’ @entity7 said			1
@entity7 says he explained to the guard that the device was for mobility			2
most businesses are required by law to allow such mobility devices for the disabled			0
in fact , the @entity40 policy explicitly allows segways ‘ inside the shopping center by people with disabilities ’ but ‘ they must be operated in a safe manner			0
’ it was the ‘ safe manner ’ part that @entity7 was then accused of disobeying			0
there was no arguing the @entity48 , which carried a sticker officially designating it as a mobility device , was allowing in the mall , but the security guard claimed @entity7 was ‘ speeding			1
’ important : @entity7 denies he was speeding and says this issue affects all disabled people who require similar mobility devices and according to the mall , the decision came down to " the safety and well - being of our shoppers			2
" master sgt. @entity85 continues to struggle with his health and says , at nearly 50 , he has no desire to be disruptive			0
‘ in fact , ’ he said , ‘ in a few days , i 'm going back up to @entity88 for surgery so the last thing i want to be is disruptive			0
’ plenty of @entity93 would be appalled to hear of the war hero disrespectful experience , but was quick to point out that all disabled @entity93 and not just veterans are affected by these sorts of incidents			0
‘ this is not about me , ’ he said			0
‘ this is about other people who also have @entity103 equipment			0
