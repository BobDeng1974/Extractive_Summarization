not content with second spot at @entity3 's goal of the year award , @entity6 women 's forward @entity5 has added another wondergoal to her collection			1
the 25 - year - old came in just behind @entity11 forward @entity13 's @entity12 superstrike in the 2014 @entity15 award contenders - and if this effort is anything to go by she could be walking @entity3 's red carpet alongside the likes of @entity21 and @entity22 again this year			1
last year @entity23 took three touches before smashing in from outside the box for @entity26 against @entity27 , but this time she needed just two to find the net with a brilliant dipping shot from 20 yards out for the @entity6 against @entity30			2
@entity5 ( far left ) opens up her body to take down a cross-field ball just outside the penalty area having taken a touch to get the ball under control and out of her feet , @entity23 blasts a shot with her left foot the @entity30 has absolutely no chance in stopping the wonderstrike from @entity23 ( now out of shot ) @entity44 ( second left ) celebrates her strike as her team - mates wheel off to praise her latest wondergoal @entity23 ( no 12 ) accepts the plaudits of her team - mates after scoring the @entity6 's first goal latching on to a cross-field ball from @entity52 , @entity23 took a touch to control the ball before striking it in mid-air over the goalkeepers head and into the net			1
after the game @entity5 said that her coaches had been telling the side to make sure they improved their finishing			0
' @entity63 ( @entity64 ) and @entity65 ( @entity66 ) and the rest of the staff have been telling us that we have to finish our chances , ' @entity5 said			0
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 ( second left ) were with @entity23 at january 's @entity72 ceremony @entity23 poses at the @entity72 ceremony in january where she finished second for goal of the year ' i was glad that i had the opportunity to get the shot off			2
' i gave @entity79 ( @entity80 ) a shout because i knew it was on my better foot , and luckily enough she left it for me and i managed to get it out of my feet and get a shot			0
' @entity6 ran out 2 - 1 winners with @entity89 adding a second goal before a @entity92 own goal pulled one back for the visitors .			0
