a new dating site is embracing genetic science to match young professionals together , by testing the dna of their customers to find certain indicators that make a good match			1
the site , @entity9 , works by mailing out dna testing kits to their customers , who then spit in a tube and send it back			1
the tube is then sent to a lab , where it is tested for the presence of two genetic markers			1
scroll down for @entity17 the front page of @entity9 , a new dating website that uses dna testing to match potential mates together the two markers tested for are the serotonin uptake controller , which is involved in how people handle positive and negative emotions			1
the second marker tested for relates to the genes influencing the person 's immune system			2
within one week , the test results appear on the user 's profile , where they can be compared with the results of other users			1
according to research by @entity38 , the maker of the testing kits used by @entity40 , there is a strong correlation between people in long - term relationships having different versions of the serotonin genes and different immune systems			2
the package that the dna testing kit arrives to the user in a lab worker removes spit from the tube sent back by the user , which is then tested for two genetic markers that can purportedly determine a good match between mates testing being performed on a saliva sample , which tests the serotonin uptake controller as well as genes related to immune system function the tests referenced on the website include an experiment at a @entity66 university where males were asked to wear the same t - shirt for two consecutive nights			1
women who had never met any of the men then smelled each t - shirt , rating the odors from most pleasant to least pleasant			0
the study revealed that the women rated the most pleasant odors ( pheromones ) as coming from the shirts worn by the men with the @entity81 gene sequence the most opposite to their own			0
' with online dating , you have socioeconomic factors people try to match on â€” religion , how much you make , ' @entity82 , co-founder of @entity38 , told @entity88			2

the ' special offer ' posted on the @entity107 page for @entity9 on a nearly daily basis according to scientists , there are a host of environmental factors that come into play when it comes to selecting a mate , and that the markers tested by @entity38 may only account for a minute portion of what causes attraction on a genetic level			1
according to one scientist who spoke to @entity88 , @entity101 is only ' looking at a very small number of genes , and you simply can not extrapolate a prediction from those genes to long - term compatibility			0
' according to one of the testimonials posted on the site , a couple named @entity136 & @entity137 said that ' using the dna sample kit was easy and fun			2
we knew we had a strong relationship going into the test , and getting the very positive results back just reinforced that			0

the site , @entity9 , works by mailing out dna tests to users , who send them back for testing
the saliva samples are sent to a lab , which tests for two key genetic markers
the genetic indicators are then posted on the user 's profile , where they are compared with other users and a potential match can be made
