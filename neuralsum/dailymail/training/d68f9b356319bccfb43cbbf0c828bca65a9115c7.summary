by @entity0 last updated at 6:00 pm on 9th december 2011 surrounded by screaming rioters and in the grip of a mob mentality , this was the moment a mother and daughter were caught on camera preparing to take part looting which left a shopkeeper with just 25p to his name			1
@entity13 , 38 , was filmed gesturing obscenely at a television camera seconds before she and her 20 - year - old daughter @entity15 stormed a convenience store which was ripped apart in a single night of violence during the @entity19 riots			1
in what became one of the enduring images of the looting , grocer @entity20 was pictured in tears with only 25p left in his pocket after rioters plundered his convenience store in @entity30 , @entity19 before setting it ablaze on august 8			1
part of the mob : @entity13 is seen making an obscene gesture to the camera while her daughter stands beside her , a blue scarf wrapped around her head jailed : mother and daughter @entity13 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) were both given custodial sentences for their part in the looting @entity13 was one of the raiders captured on @entity45 breaking into @entity46 , while her daughter @entity15 could also be seen emptying the shelves			1
the 20 - year - old kept her face covered throughout the raid in a vain attempt to avoid detection			1
but the shameless pair were caught after her mother pulled down her scarf to swear at the camera as a masked mob of other suspected looters swarmed around the store			1
the defiant gesture cost the mother and daughter team their liberty when they were jailed for violent disorder and burglary			1
the pair stood in the dock together as they were put behind bars at @entity71			1
@entity72 was jailed for two years while her daughter will be locked up in a young offenders ' institution for 28 months			1
looted : @entity72 and her daughter ransacked this shop in @entity30 victim : @entity80 is pleased that justice has been done after his shop was torn apart in the rioting @entity15 and her mother , who live together in @entity85 , were each charged with violent disorder and burglary on october 21			1
@entity72 admitted violent disorder , but denied the burglary charge , which was then dropped			2
shopkeeper @entity20 , who has renamed his store @entity91 , was devastated when savage looters stole his entire stock and even took some of the building 's fittings and fixtures			2
but mr @entity20 said today : ' i feel like justice has been done			2
' detective inspector @entity100 , of @entity102 's riot investigation unit , said he was pleased with the sentences			2
he warned : ' if you were involved in the disorder , then i encourage you to come forward before we come to you			2
' @entity20 fled his home in @entity109 - controlled northern @entity108 in 1996 to escape a bloody civil war			0
believing @entity112 was a country where he could be safe and would be allowed to run a business , it was this country he chose to build a new life for himself			0
he started out as a newsagent and slowly expanded his business into a convenience shop , saying he considered it an ' honour ' to serve his new community			0
but in a cruel twist of irony , some of his customers were among the yobs who targeted his shop			0
the 39 - year - old former refugee was horrified when he saw live news footage of his shop being attacked during the riots			0
he had boarded up the shop and gone home to protect his wife and two daughters , aged six and two , after gangs began to prowl through @entity30 the day after the first outbreak of violence in @entity137			0
the former refuge was stunned to find that looters had smashed anything they could not steal including a bank cash machine			0
they took everything including fixtures and fittings and shelving before setting the store ablaze , leaving the devastated businessman with a £ 50,000 repair bill			0
but loyal customers rallied around and launched the ‘ @entity153 ’ appeal fund , which raised more than £ 30,000 to help @entity20 return to business			0
his store in @entity30 - now officially named @entity91 - re-opened just one week after the riots .			0
