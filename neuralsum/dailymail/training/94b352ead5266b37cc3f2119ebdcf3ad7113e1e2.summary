by @entity0 a dog abandoned in @entity2 because of his extreme bow legs is going from wonky to walkies after being brought to @entity6			1
@entity7 , a loveable ten - month - old @entity8 who is also partially sighted , had faced a life of misery with his crippling deformity			1
a nutritional problem is thought to have made his front legs seriously bowed and his @entity2 owner gave up on him			1
generous animal lovers donated hundreds of pounds to pay for his transportation and treatment			1
@entity7 arrived a month ago and last week had the initial operation to fix one of his legs with his right being treated first			1
cause : it 's thought that @entity7 's condition came about through malnutrition the complicated procedures are being carried out for free by surgeon @entity43 who is a partner at @entity45 vets in @entity29			1
@entity43 said : ‘ so far it has gone really well			0
at the moment he is on cage rest because he needs to rest a lot but he is already trying to do much more than we allow him to			0
‘ we are seeing improvements already and he is walking much more comfortably and faster than before and that is just with one leg fixed			2
’ expert team : ( left to right ) @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity60 - @entity59 and @entity43 with @entity7 @entity43 and colleagues have also started physiotherapy on @entity7 's straightened right leg and hope to carry out hydrotherapy when his left leg has been treated			1
other donors have provided the money for other treatment , including an mri scan at a reduced price and a visit to an eye specialist			0
the plates needed to straighten his legs , which normally cost around £ 200 , have been donated for free			2
x-ray : vets established from scans ( left ) that @entity7 needs plates inserted into his legs and the picture on the right show his leg after a successful operation sleep : he 's pictured on the left recovering after the operation , along with his toys , and on the right having woken up @entity43 , who is carrying out the operations on his day off , added : ‘ a lot of other people have helped with what he needs			1
‘ a lot of good people have helped him and a lot of people donated money			0
‘ he is a lovely dog			2
he is very gentle and loving			0
you really could not wish for a nicer dog			2
’ in good hands : @entity102 staff the operation on @entity7 was carried out by a vet on his day off a local @entity106 branch have also supplied @entity7 with a new bed and toys			1
@entity27 , who runs the @entity109 in distress charity , has decided to adopt him when his operations are complete			2
she said : ‘ i saw his picture and that was it			0
we had to get him over			0
i am over the moon with his progress			0
@entity43 and @entity57 examine @entity7 ‘ i am speechless and overwhelmed by people 's kindness and generosity shown to an abandoned dog			1
‘ a month ago he had no hope of ever walking properly or hope of the gift of sight			0
no - one had heard his name or knew of his existence			0
‘ here he is now , facing a whole new life , happy and safe , thanks to people prepared to give			0
