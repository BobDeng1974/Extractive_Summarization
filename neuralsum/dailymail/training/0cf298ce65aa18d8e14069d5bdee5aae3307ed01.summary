‘ the starting point has to be that what comes next does not inhibit the @entity72			0

@entity20 mr @entity20 is likely to give his version of the incident in which he is said to have told @entity11 he had declared war on his media empire after @entity99 switched its support to the conservatives in september 2009			1
mr @entity11 told the inquiry in april that mr @entity20 had rung him in an ' unbalanced ' state of mind			1

@entity2 mr @entity2 will be asked about his role in the appointment of @entity38 and could also be questioned over any role he had in the @entity9 saga after it emerged during mr @entity79 's evidence that , after expressing his concerns , the @entity80 had been texted by the chancellor on the subject			2
less than an hour before responsibility for the bid was transferred to mr @entity79 from @entity83 , mr @entity2 sent him a message saying : ' i hope you like the solution			2

mr @entity129 said he told sir @entity22 : ' i 've got a bucket of s * * * on my desk , prime minister , and i 'm going to pour it all over you , ' when the then - leader asked how the story was going to be covered in the paper the next day			0

but it is the prime minister 's evidence that is likely to take centre stage			0
his friendship with former newspaper boss @entity34 has been under scrutiny , after she said he texted her regularly , often signed off his text messages to her with ‘ lol ’ , which he wrongly believed stood for ‘ lots of love ’			0

in a bombshell email , the @entity80 lavished praise on the £ 8 billion bid and mr @entity17 then put him in charge of the quasi-judicial decision			2
mr @entity17 judged afterwards that the @entity80 had acted ' properly ' throughout the period when he was responsible for the bid and decided not to order an investigation into whether he had breached the ministerial code of conduct			2
mr @entity79 also insisted there was no reason for him to quit - though he admitted in his evidence that he had considered resigning during his six - hour grilling a week ago			0
embarrassingly @entity196 was also forced to apply for core participant status in an emergency hearing last month , allowing them to inspect any relevant text messages or emails which have been submitted to the inquiry by other witnesses before giving evidence themselves			0
