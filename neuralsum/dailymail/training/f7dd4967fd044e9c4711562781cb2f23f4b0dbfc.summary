@entity1 @entity0 produced another major cup upset on a feisty night that ended with @entity5 manager @entity4 refusing to shake the hand of his victorious rival @entity8			1
@entity10 's scrappy second - half winner – following an error from @entity13 goalkeeper @entity12 – took the @entity14 into their second consecutive major cup semi-final following their run in last season 's @entity17			1
it was accompanied by a constant roar from the @entity22 faithful and the animated presence on the touchline of @entity8 and his assistant , former blades skipper @entity25			2
@entity0 's @entity26 striker @entity10 celebrates after putting his side 1 - 0 up @entity10 pounces to send the ball towards goal as @entity12 desperately tries to stop it the ball crosses the line and hits the back of the net as @entity0 go 1 - 0 up at @entity22 @entity0 players celebrate the opening goal as @entity12 ( left ) shows his frustrations @entity5 players can only watch as the ball goes into the back of the net for @entity0 's opener tempers fray on the touchline as @entity0 coach @entity25 is sent to the stands at @entity22 @entity8 ( centre ) holds out his hands as @entity4 walks off and refuses to shake hands with his counterpart @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity49 6 ; @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 6 , @entity53 7.5 ; @entity54 7 ( @entity55 81 ) , @entity56 6 , @entity57 6.5 ( @entity58 46 , 6 ) , @entity59 6 ( @entity60 73 ) ; @entity61 6.5 , @entity10 6.5 subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 scorer : @entity10 63 booked : @entity53 , @entity51 , @entity59 @entity5 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity12 6 ; @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 6 , @entity70 6 , @entity71 5.5 ( @entity72 46 , 6 ) ; @entity73 5.5 , @entity74 5.5 ; ( @entity75 74 ) , @entity76 5.5 ( @entity77 71 ) , @entity78 6 , @entity79 6 ; long 5.5 subs not used : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity54 sent off : @entity70 booked : @entity76 , @entity68 , @entity74 , @entity73 , @entity69 referee : @entity84 6.5 @entity85 : @entity53 attendance : 21,906 @entity25 was sent to the stands after @entity0 's goal for making one comment too many and afterwards @entity4 blanked @entity8 's offer to shake hands			1
' i only shake hands with people who have respect for me as a coach , who have respect for the fourth official , ' said the clearly cheesed off @entity98			1
' the behaviour of the bench of @entity0 , i have never seen that ( before )			2
that was the reason i did n't shake hands			1
' @entity8 's father @entity102 would n't have been happy at any alleged haranguing of fourth official @entity104 or any other official but he would have been delighted by the effort and commitment shown by the underdogs			2
even though @entity5 had lost their last four games and were without suspended top scorer @entity111 , they do stand fifth in the @entity112 and were hot favourites after @entity4 named a strong team with regulars @entity68 , @entity79 and @entity74 included , and @entity73 making a welcome return from injury			1
but @entity0 just did n't let them settle from the first whistle to the last , so much so that even @entity4 did n't have any complaint about the final outcome			1
' we hit the ball too long , we did n't play our normal football and to give them credit , they made it difficult for us , ' he said			0
after an opening 45 minutes that saw 19 fouls committed without a single shot on target being registered , the home side – who beat @entity129 earlier in the competition – stepped up a gear			0
@entity53 ( left ) celebrates with goalkeeper @entity49 as @entity0 progress to the semi-finals @entity5 players look dejected after conceding the opening goal in the quarter - final clash @entity0 manager @entity8 and coach @entity25 ( left ) have a word with referee @entity84 @entity0 goalkeeper @entity49 goes flying as he collides with @entity5 's @entity76 @entity0 's @entity53 ( right ) puts in the tackle on @entity5 's @entity76 @entity5 's @entity76 ( centre ) holds off the challenge from @entity0 's @entity54 @entity5 ’s first shot on target in the match did n’t arrive until the 70th minute			1
they had eight attempts off target before then			0
@entity12 made fantastic saves to keep out @entity61 and @entity56 but then became a culprit as @entity155 took the lead after 63 minutes			0
a free - kick by @entity53 was fumbled by the @entity5 goalkeeper and from a couple of yards , @entity10 beat a posse of players from both sides to get their first and squeeze the ball over the line			1
the @entity166 , signed from @entity167 in the summer , could n't stop smiling and said : ' it was a striker 's goal , a poach inside the box			0
' @entity8 was also delighted			2
his side , fifth in @entity1 , have now beaten four @entity112 clubs in 2014			2
his half - time substitute @entity58 was playing non-league football for @entity176 a few weeks ago			0
' the only disappointment was we did n't win by more , ' said @entity8			0
' that 's the story , i do n't think a sentence should be written about the managers , ' he said rather irritatedly when the subject of the non-handshake came up			0
the real surprise was that @entity5 failed to pepper the @entity0 goal when they had 27 minutes to save the tie			2
instead , the home side seemed likelier to score and @entity5 's misery was compounded at the start of four minutes ' injury - time when @entity70 was shown the red card for fouling @entity10 as he threatened to break away and make it 2 - 0			1
here are the attacking stats from @entity0 's 1 - 0 cup upset against @entity5 - now click here for the rest from our @entity198 @entity5 goalkeeper @entity12 ( right ) safely catches the ball after a chance for @entity54 @entity0 striker @entity10 ( centre ) finds himself surrounded by @entity5 players @entity5 players gather for a huddle ahead of the @entity207 quarter - final at @entity22 a chastened @entity4 admitted : ' it 's cup football and it 's not about the level			1
they showed the best cup experience			0
it 's not the first time and it 's not the last time a @entity1 club will beat a @entity112			1
' @entity8 pointed out afterwards his side were forced to field a right - winger @entity50 at right - back against a team of internationals			0
' it is an incredible night for the club , ' he said			0
' i thought we deserved the victory , we created more chances and the only disappointment was that we should have had another goal			0
' whoever we get in the semi-final will be a special occasion , but nights like tonight stay in the memory for a long time			0
' as a player with @entity235 when his dad @entity102 was the manager , @entity8 won the @entity207 twice in 1989 and 1990			2
with @entity238 still in the competition , it 'd be a brave man to predict he 'll complete a hat - trick but it wo n't be for a lack of trying			0
