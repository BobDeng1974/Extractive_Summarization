@entity0 has become the most expensive @entity2 defender ever at £ 32million and @entity3 won out in a three - way battle with @entity5 and @entity6			1
but despite this accolade the 23 - year - old still has much to prove at the highest level			0
here , @entity10 gives you some background on the @entity14 centre half ... @entity3 tried to sign @entity0 and @entity16 pal @entity15 in january but it ’s taken until the summer to seal deals			1
why the delay ? everything seemed ready to go last month , but negotiations stalled because a private company owned 33 per cent of his economic rights			0
@entity16 only received £ 23m of the £ 31.9m fee with the rest said to have been paid to @entity27			0
record breaker : @entity0 has finally signed for @entity3 for £ 32m @entity0 - £ 32m @entity16 to @entity3 , aug 2014 @entity29 - £ 30m @entity30 to @entity5 , july 2002 @entity31 - £ 27m ( rising to £ 31.5m ) @entity32 to @entity5 , june 2014 @entity33 - £ 22m @entity34 to @entity3 , aug 2009 @entity35 - £ 21m @entity36 to @entity6 , jan 2011 but is n’t he @entity38 ? he was born in @entity39 but moved to @entity40 at five , where he started as a striker			1
@entity44 converted him to a defender and sold him to @entity16 for £ 6m			2
he is one of four frenchmen at @entity47 , along with @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
despite his fee he could n’t get a game for @entity14 at the @entity53 and was their fourth - choice centre back			1
did n’t @entity5 want him ? and @entity6			1
asked about his preference in may , he said : ‘ @entity3 or @entity6 ? @entity6 because it ’s @entity57			2
’ how will he fit into @entity3 's backline ? @entity0 has the tools — power , pace and composure — to be the ideal partner for @entity64			2
and does n't he still retain some of that striker 's instinct ? he does - last season he scored three times in @entity69 competition ( in the @entity70 and @entity71 )			0
did n’t @entity75 cap @entity3 ’s net spend this summer at £ 49m ? yes , and they ’ve spent £ 49.9m on @entity0 , @entity15 , @entity77 and @entity78			2
@entity48 was free and @entity79 is on loan			0
they got £ 10m from @entity82 for @entity83 and £ 12m will follow when @entity84 joins @entity85			0
rarely seen : @entity0 , consoling @entity86 , did not play a minute at the @entity53 scoring touch : @entity0 ( no 22 ) heads home for @entity16 against @entity89 last season			1

@entity3 beat @entity5 and @entity6 to sign @entity0
defender was born in @entity39 but moved to @entity40 aged five
did n't play a minute for @entity14 at @entity53
