two years ago , aged 18 , @entity0 made an impulsive decision that has cast a shadow over his life ever since			1
on a whim he had a large tattoo inked onto his chest depicting two women 's faces - one of them with skull - like features - with the wording : ' we must let go of the life we have planned so to accept the life that is waiting for us ' scrawled between them			1
his shocked and devastated parents tried for months to convince him to have the design removed but it was only the negative reaction of his peers on a holiday that finally convinced him to begin laser treatment			1
@entity24 , pictured with @entity0 , was devastated when she discovered @entity0 had had the massive tattoo before : @entity0 had the tattoo depicting two women , one of whom appears mutilated , with the wording ' we must let go of the life we have planned so to accept the life that is waiting for us ' in between them done on a whim after : @entity0 is over half way through a course of intensive laser treatments to remove the massive tattoo when @entity0 first expressed a desire to have a tattoo his parents @entity39 and @entity24 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , were strongly against the notion			1
his mother @entity24 , 54 , said : ' we told him there will come a point where you will regret it			1
' but despite discussing with @entity0 at length the permanence of a tattoo he had small designs inked both on his ribs and both his ankles			1
however , it was his third trip to the tattoo parlor where things went badly wrong			2
@entity24 only discovered her son had been inked with the massive design across his chest when she stumbled across a picture he had posted on @entity66			1
' my first thought was " oh my @entity70 , they are absolutely awful " , ' she explained			2
' we did n't understand why he would have chosen that image as it is so at odds with the @entity0 we know			1
@entity0 admits he did n't put much thought into the design , which he initially wanted smaller ' it was grotesque			1
i found it disturbing and offensive as well as derogatory to women			2
one of the women looked like she had been mutilated			2
' he is a caring , emotional boy who cares about what people think , and just so different from the image that tattoo portrayed			2
' the quote suggested he had had a bad life , when in actual fact he has led a good , happy life			2
he was born so perfect and to me , now , i felt he was scarred , that he had destroyed his body			0
' we were absolutely devastated			0
i cried constantly for about two weeks			0
i just could n't bare to look at it and see what he had done			0
' @entity24 and husband @entity39 ( left ) were particularly upset as the design did not reflect @entity0 's character at all it was n't until he went on a summer holiday with his friends that @entity0 realised the impact of what he had done and despite his outward bravado , @entity0 admits that he had his doubts about the tattoo almost as soon as it was finished			1
' i had just strolled into the tattoo parlour and i saw a design and just picked it			0
there was no real thought involved			0
' i initially wanted it smaller but they said it would n't be possible and i was so eager to have it done i just went with it			0
' at the time all my friends were getting tattooed and i thought it was the ' thing ' to do			0
we were all about to go on a lads holiday and we all wanted to be inked for the beach			0
' the moment i walked out i was gutted			0
i was think " what on earth have i done "			0
' but obviously i had to pretend i was fine with it			0
' although @entity24 and @entity39 begged their son to get the tattoo removed he insisted he like it and refused , despite his mothers obvious anguish			1
it was n't until he went on a summer holiday with his friends that @entity0 realised the impact of what he had done			1
@entity39 and @entity24 , centre , with daughter @entity139 , 24 , far left , were happywhen @entity0 ( right ) agreed to remove his tat ' i got completely the opposite reaction of what i had expected on the beach			1
people were actually coming up to me and being like " what the hell is that on your chest ? " ' @entity0 explained			1
receiving an increasingly negative reaction @entity0 began to come round to the idea of removing the tattoo , much to his mother 's joy			1
' i was overjoyed when he said he wanted it lasered			0
just over the moon , ' she said			0
however , @entity0 still had to undergo the agonizing removal procedure			1
speaking of the @entity160 's @entity159 tattoo removal treatment sessions , which he is still undergoing at a leading @entity162 tattoo removal studio , @entity163 , @entity0 , now 21 , said : '' i ca n't decribe it , it is the worse pain i 've ever experienced			1
' it is like a red hot elastic band being pinged against you over and over and i could smell my own skin burning			0
but despite the pain of the treatments , @entity0 and mum @entity24 are delighted with the results , although @entity0 will still need several more sessions to fully remove the tattoo completely			1
' the guy before my first treatment was a rugby player and passed out ; but the pain is better than the tattoo , ' he said			2
' i felt really happy after my first treatment and am becoming even more determined to get rid of them as quickly as possible			2
i definitely wo n't be getting another			0
' when asked what advice he would give someone considering a tattoo @entity0 says : ' i 'm definitely not against them all together			2
but i would definitely say think about it			0
' someone told me , put the design up on your wall for a year or two			0
if you still like it after that then you 're probably ok			0

@entity0 was 18 when he had ink scrawled across his chest on a ' whim '
mother @entity24 was *horrified* after finding out on @entity66
now undergoing ' agonising ' laser treatment to totally *eradicate* it
