@entity4 ( left ) resigned as the @entity5 after admitting to have an affair with parishioner @entity16 ( right ) - despite that , he said he wants to stay in the church in an interview with the @entity21 , @entity19 said : ' i 've never regretted being a priest			1
i 've never felt unhappy , i 've enjoyed it and tried to do whatever was asked of me			2
' i 've always gone where i 've been sent and i hope to do the same again			2
' the affair was exposed when @entity27 hired a private detective to follow his wife , @entity29 , when their marriage broke down			1
a second love affair six years ago also came to light and yesterday there were claims of a third woman in his life			1
the bishop decided to resign because it ' was the easiest way to avoid further embarrassment , disappointment ... and shame for the church			1
' in his resignation statement he made a point of saying his actions ' were not illegal and did not involve minors			0
' @entity19 ( pictured ) said he will do any job that comes his way if he is allowed to remain in the church mr @entity27 realised his wife was being unfaithful when she failed to turn up for choir practice at their local church			1
the @entity58 executive said : ' i thought it was odd when she did n’t arrive at choir practice because normally she would never miss one			0
i went to her house to drop some music through her letterbox but she was n’t at home			0
‘ by then it was about 10pm and i thought it was really weird			0
i decided it was time to test my suspicion that she was having an affair			2
‘ i went up to the bishop ’s residence and her car was there			2
i checked and it was there all night			0
‘ i thought the bishop was someone who was honest and liberal			2
he is a man who has trained marriage counsellors – and is someone i had seriously thought of turning to for advice in relation to my own marriage			0
‘ now , because he was such a powerful public figure , i could not go to anyone in the @entity84			0
i wanted to protect my family , i wanted to protect the children but i did not know what to do			0
’ @entity19 admitted the married mother - of - two had stayed over at his detached home in @entity90 the scandal has come at a time when the church is under growing pressure to consider relaxing its requirement for priests to remain celibate and to allow married men to become ordained			1
@entity19 told @entity98 , of the @entity21 : ' when a priest makes a promise of celibacy , he promises to remain unmarried , that 's all			2
then the ordinary rules of morality apply			0
' but i 'd like to make it clear i 'm not calling for a change			0
celibacy may be a tradition rather than an article of faith but the vast majority of priests are faithful to their promise , faithful to what the church expects of them			1
and i have great respect and admiration for that			0
