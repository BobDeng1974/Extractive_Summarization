actress @entity0 first turned down the role of @entity3 ’s imperious @entity2 in @entity4 20 years ago because , aged 60 then , she thought she was too old to play the role of a 20 - year - old girl ’s mother			1
now she has taken on the part at the age of 80 for the latest @entity11 stage production			1
@entity12 , 62 , is playing @entity13 , who is meant to be in his late 20s , as is his friend @entity15 , played by 72 - year - old @entity16			1
@entity2 ’s daughter , @entity17 , is played by 62 - year - old @entity18			1
from left , @entity16 , @entity18 , @entity12 and @entity20 have a combined age of 276 , despite this , the cast of @entity3 's @entity4 are wowing audiences in the @entity11 yes , this version of the play — described by @entity3 himself as ‘ a trivial comedy for serious people ’ — is a little different			1
it has an older cast than you would traditionally see in this comedy of manners			2
the play is one of the most performed in @entity38 theatre			1
but few productions have divided critics like this one			2
the @entity42 ’s @entity41 gave it five stars and said it made him fall in love with the play all over again			1
in contrast , another critic found it ‘ a third - rate production			2
performed by arthritic actors ’			2
he seemed to take particular objection to @entity12 ’s ‘ preposterously abundant hair ’			2
well - coiffed @entity12 laughs when he thinks about how his hair has the power to offend			2
and then he shrugs : ‘ but the whole thing was my idea , i ’m afraid			2
i thought it was such a brilliant play that it could take doing something different with it			1
not everyone agrees , but people hate change do n’t they ? ’ @entity12 fell in love with the play 32 years ago when he starred in a @entity66 production as the charming rotter @entity68 — a part he feels was made for him — with @entity16 playing his friend , @entity70			1
it starred @entity72 as @entity2 and was a huge success at the @entity74			1
@entity16 and @entity12 play two friends who are ordinarily in their late 20s or early 30s some of the backstage antics would have added to the acclaim — if the audiences had known about them			1
@entity12 suddenly appeared naked in the wings while @entity16 was on stage — causing him to explode with laughter			2
@entity16 , in retaliation , put @entity12 ’s dressing room clock forward , and persuaded the staff to panic him into believing he had missed his cue			2
@entity12 and @entity16 have remained close friends and the show helped make both of them household names but they were never asked to work together again			2
so they decided to make it happen			2
‘ i saw @entity16 for breakfast and said : “ you know how we always said we would do it again ? well let ’s do it now , ” recalls @entity12			0
‘ he said : “ that ’s ridiculous , we are far too old			0
” but then we talked about ways of making it work			0
‘ in my mind , these days if you are 60 , it ’s a bit like you were 30 a century ago			1
the way we age has changed			0
i thought that we could experiment with that and move the goal posts around			0
’ @entity16 came up with the idea of ‘ framing ’ the play within another			1
so the actors are also playing a group of amateur dramatic buffs called the @entity115 who are obsessed with the play			1
the performance of the show is depicted as their dress rehearsal			0
playwright @entity121 was brought in to write the ‘ play around the play ’ and @entity12 gave him some hints about what old actors who love performing @entity4 are like			1
‘ at the @entity74 , after about a month in , i winked at the audience after the first act and it got a huge laugh , ’ recalls @entity12			0
‘ in the interval there was a bang on my dressing room door and it was @entity66 who said : “ i was watching tonight and do n’t you dare do that again			0
” ‘ so i said , “ i ’m so sorry , ” and said i would n’t			0
but i carried on doing it , of course			0
it seemed the right thing to do			0
so i told @entity121 and he put it into his bit of the play			1
’ then they looked around to see who else would join them : they did n’t have to look far			0
@entity16 ’s wife , @entity148 , was brought in to play @entity149 while @entity12 ’s long - time collaborator @entity150 takes the part of the sweet and slightly mad @entity152			1
for @entity17 , @entity12 immediately thought of @entity18			1
the two were in the same class at the @entity155 in @entity156 , but had never worked together			0
she says : ‘ @entity12 and @entity16 explained their idea and i said , “ i have a feeling it will be a terrific adventure ” and it has been			0
the popular @entity3 play is currently being performed at the @entity163 theatre in @entity156 ‘ @entity12 is young for his age anyway ; he has a sense of mischief			1
if i fluff on stage , he gives me this look as if to say , “ @entity169 , went wrong there , did n’t you ? ” which is extremely off - putting			0
’ @entity12 laughs and then winks			0
she does n’t think there is anything wrong with playing an innocent enjoying the first flush of love			1
‘ when i play @entity17 , i instantly start to feel and act more girlishly			1
i ’ve told @entity12 i would like to do @entity178 next			0
’ she would n’t be the first older @entity179 ; @entity0 played her some years ago in @entity179 , which was based in an old people ’s home			1
@entity0 agreed to play @entity2 earlier this year in @entity183 , believing she could get away with it in @entity185 because there the role is often taken by men			1
‘ apart from me playing the mother of a girl of 20 , the production i did in @entity185 was more traditional , but both times the audience reaction has been the same , ’ she says			1
‘ they laugh in the same places and when you reach the big denouement they shriek			0
it ’s not us ; it ’s the play			2
’ but there are downsides to being in a play written for people 30 or 40 years younger			1
‘ it ’s very physically demanding , ’ admits @entity16			0
he looks at @entity207 for confirmation			0
‘ yes , this is taking it out of me a bit , ’ agrees @entity12			0
‘ and @entity16 said last night : “ blimey , i feel a bit knackered			0
being a 72 - year - old playing a 28 - year - old is very tiring			2
” we have to take care of ourselves a bit more than we used to			0
normally , i can go all day without breakfast or lunch			0
i have to have them now , though , because i need all the energy i can muster			0
’ and then he sits down .			0

@entity20 turned down the role 20 years ago because 60 was too old
now two decades later , ms @entity20 , 80 , is playing @entity2 in the farce
@entity18 , 62 , is playing @entity17 , who in the play is just 20
