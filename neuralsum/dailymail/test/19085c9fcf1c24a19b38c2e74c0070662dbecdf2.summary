a weakening @entity1 economy spilled into the job market in march as employers added just 126,000 jobs 0the fewest since december 2013 – snapping a 12 - month streak of gains above 200,000			1
the unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent , the @entity7 said in its monthly report friday			1
the march jobs data raised uncertainties about the world 's largest economy , which for months has been the envy of other industrialized nations for its steadily robust hiring and growth			1
employers now appear wary about the economy , especially as a strong dollar has slowed @entity1 exports , home sales have sputtered and cheaper gasoline has yet to unleash more consumer spending			1
last month 's subpar job growth could make the @entity43 less likely to start raising interest rates from record lows in june , as some have been anticipating			0
the @entity43 may decide that the economy still needs the benefit of low borrowing costs to generate healthy growth			0
reflecting that sentiment , government bond yields fell friday			2
the yield on the @entity1 10 - year treasury note dropped to 1.84 percent from 1.90 percent before the jobs report was released			1
@entity1 stock markets are closed in observance of @entity58			1
economists noted that for months hiring had been stronger than other gauges of the economy , suggesting that a pullback in job gains was inevitable			2
' job growth has been running at a stupendous pace in @entity1 over the last several months , increasingly out of tune with other economic indicators , which have pointed to a slowdown , ' @entity64 , senior economist at @entity65 , wrote in a research note			1
' the reckoning in march closes at least some of this gap			2
' at the same time , some said last month 's data looks bleak in part because hiring had been so robust in the months that preceded it			2
' employers are n't laying people off , ' noted @entity82 , director of economic research at the accounting and consulting firm @entity84			1
' what they 've decided to do is slow down the pace at which they 're hiring until they have more confidence			2
' last month , the manufacturing , building and government sectors all shed workers			1
factories cut 1,000 , snapping a 19 - month hiring streak			1
construction jobs also fell by 1,000 , the first drop in 15 months			1
hiring at restaurants plunged from february			2
the mining and logging sector , which includes oil drilling , lost 11,000			0
some other categories showed continued gains			0
health care added 22,000 workers			1
professional and business services – a sector that includes lawyers , engineers , accountants and office temps – gained 40,000			1
financial services expanded by 8,000 , and retailers maintained their 12 - month pace by adding 25,900			2
in addition to reporting sluggish hiring for march , the government revised down its estimate of job gains in february and january by a combined 69,000			1
wage growth in march remained modest			2
average hourly wages rose 7 cents to $ 24.86 an hour			0
@entity126 : @entity127 , left , attended a 15 - county event in @entity129 in search of work on thursday			0
she 's been unemployed for the past four months that marked a year - over - year pay increase of just 2.1 percent			0
but because average hours worked fell in march for the first time in 15 months , @entity1 actually earned less on average than they did in february			1
tepid pay increases have been a drag on the economy since the @entity140 ended nearly six years ago			0
many @entity1 remain out of the labor force , partly because many baby boomers are reaching retirement age			1
the percentage of @entity1 who are either working or looking for work fell in march to 62.7 percent , tying the lowest such rate since 1978			1
job growth had been healthy for more than a year before march			0
yet the streak of strong hiring , along with cheaper gasoline , has n't significantly boosted consumer spending			1
the @entity43 signaled last month that it would be cautious in raising rates from record lows			0
the @entity43 has yet to rule out a june rate hike			0
but many analysts expect the first increase no earlier than september			0
graph illustrating monthly @entity1 unemployment up to march 2015 in part , that 's because @entity43 officials have revised down the range of unemployment they view as consistent with a healthy economy to 5 percent to 5.2 percent from 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent previously			1
the weak hiring last month could give them further pause about a june rate hike			1
' i think ( june ) is completely off the table , ' said @entity174 , chief economist at the financial services company @entity175			0
the @entity43 wo n't likely raise rates until it sees evidence of consistently solid growth			0
but the economy has weakened in the first two months of 2015 , in part because of the tough winter			0
cheaper oil has led energy companies to halt orders for pipelines and equipment , hurting manufacturers			0
at the same time , the strengthening dollar has made @entity1 - made goods costlier abroad , thereby cutting into exports			2
this year 's job growth has yet to ignite a larger boom in consumer spending			0
@entity193 's , @entity194 , the @entity195 and other major employers have announced raises for their lowest - paid employees			0
but those pay raises are staggered and unlikely to fuel faster wage growth			0
the economy has disproportionately added lower - paying jobs in the retail and restaurant sectors since the economic recovery began in mid- 2009			2
adding jobs in the lowest - paid industries can suppress average hourly wages , even when employers are rewarding cashiers , waiters and sales clerks with pay bumps .			0

official unemployment rate – which does n't count people who have dropped out of the labor force – stands at 5.5 per cent
@entity219 , construction and government sectors all cut jobs in march
other sectors , including health care , lawyers , engineers , accountants and retailers , grew their workforces
could be a temporary blip as the @entity1 recovers from an unseasonably cold march that may have *tamped* down hiring
