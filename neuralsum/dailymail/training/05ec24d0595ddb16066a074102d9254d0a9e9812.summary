by @entity0 it 's certainly not everyone 's cup of tea and can cause those not used to @entity6 hours of agonising over missing screws and parts that do n't fit as they become increasingly frustrated while putting up their flatpack furniture			1
but one handyman has now come to their aid after becoming a full time professional flatpacker			2
@entity16 , 36 , who studied cabinet making at university , relishes the challenge of piecing together the household goods and says he regularly gets called out by those in a spot of bother			1
@entity16 makes a living by building flatpack furniture for those who struggle with @entity6 mr @entity16 , of @entity26 , south east @entity27 , said : ' not everyone has the energy , patience , skills or tools to put together furniture			1
' i ’ve been trained to do this and i absolutely love it - it ’s like playing around with wooden lego			0
' people go to @entity40 and buy all their furniture , but when they get it home they have n’t the faintest idea of what to do with all the pieces			2
' it makes sense for a professional to do it for you - flatpacks are only in a box to get them through your front door , cars start in bits but you would n’t try and put one together on your own			0
' i get called out by people all the time who are in the middle of building something and it ’s about to fall on top of them			0
' mr @entity16 , who co-owns the furniture assembling company @entity66 with business partner @entity68 , says no job is too big for his expertise			1
mr @entity16 studied cabinet making at university and says he regularly gets called out by @entity6 novices mr @entity16 , of @entity26 , south east @entity27 , said : ' not everyone has the energy , patience , skills or tools to put together furniture ' he said : ' sometimes you ’ll walk into a room where someone has tried to assemble the furniture and it ’s just a big mess			1
' i ’ve even had men ask me to finish the job extra quick as they ’ve lied to their wives that they ’ll assemble it by the time they get home , and they want to take the credit			0
' the most difficult piece of furniture to assemble has got to be the @entity95 day bed - it can be quite tricky as it has lots of components			2
' the piece i hate doing the most is the @entity100 book case			0
mr @entity16 , who co-owns the furniture assembling company @entity66 with business partner @entity68 , says no job is too big for his expertise ' it ’s just so easy and monotonous , i prefer a challenge			1
' there ’s only been one time when i wondered if i was ever going to finish a job - a customer had brought a media unit that was huge - 12 by 8 foot and weighed about a quarter of a ton			0
' it must have taken about five of us to lift and put together			0
' mr @entity16 began his interest at the age of ten and started working as a cabinet maker when he left school before going on to study the subject at university			1
he said : ' i passed with a distinction but i was n’t sure what to do next so i went to the job centre			0
' the lady there told me there was such a job as a flatpack assembler			2
mr @entity16 began his interest at the age of ten and started working as a cabinet maker when he left school before going on to study the subject at university ' when i tell people what i do for a living i get one of three reactions			1
' the first is shock as they never even knew the service existed , the second is that it sounds like a great business idea , and the third is that they would n’t need to hire me as they could do it themselves - they ’re usually wrong			0
' since mr @entity68 started @entity66 in 2005 , the company has gone from strength to strength , and it now works in partnership with some of the biggest homeware brands in the @entity154			1
mr @entity16 , who charges £ 30 an hour for his flatpacking services , said : ' we ’re now the official assembly partners for @entity157 and in talks with other big brands			2
' we have a national presence now and have about 150 fitters that cover the whole of the @entity154			0
