by @entity0 ' the tendency now is to consider drugs or operations as a quick fix if you are overweight ' , said dr @entity6 on the @entity7 show this morning			0
and a quick fix is exactly what @entity9 was desperate for when he begged his mother @entity11 for a gastric band operation at the age of just 13			1
' i had tried to kill myself , ' he told presenter @entity15			0
' i begged her to have the operation to change my life			2
' @entity9 calls on obese teenagers to opt for exercise and healthy eating @entity9 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , is now 18 and says he wants the procedure reversed			1
' over the years it stopped working and now it 's causing me so much trouble			1
' i get in extreme unbearable pain which stops me from standing up			2
it 's like really bad cramp that wo n't go away			0
' he now wants to warn other teenagers not to go down the same route as he did			0
' exercise should be the way - and schools should help			1
fitness should be a priority			0
' @entity9 became the youngest person in the @entity38 to have a gastric band fitted in 2008			1
his family decided to take the drastic action after constant bullying about his weight led to a suicide attempt			2
his mother had spent most of her life struggling with her weight too and at one point had been dubbed @entity38 's most obese woman			2
@entity9 said : ' the bullying was really bad , i could n't stand it , ' he said			2
' a gastric band was the only way at the time , what they said was ruining my life			1
' ' i turned to food for comfort			0
after i finished school , if i had money , i 'd go and buy loads of sweets , go home , eat them then cry			0
' at his heaviest , @entity9 tipped the scales at 16 stone 8lbs at just 13 years old @entity9 pictured here with his family and mother @entity11 , ' @entity38 's most obese woman ' who passed in 2010 ' before i had my gastric band it was a very difficult time for me at age 13			1
i tried to commit suicide , i begged mum to have the operation to change my life			1
' ' she definitely realised she wanted to see me happy and not have to go through what she went through			0
' at the time it was fantastic			2
i lost weight , was so happy , regained my confidence , started socialising and made loads of new friends			0
' @entity9 's story first hit the headlines in 2010 after the death of his mother @entity11			1
now aged 18 , @entity9 wishes he could turn back the clock and is desperate to have the band removed to end the pain he experiences daily			1
@entity9 , a careworker for disabled children , has lived in almost constant agony for the past few years since he earned the dubious accolade of being the youngest person in the @entity38 to be fitted with a gastric band			1
the controversial operation , which made national headlines , was performed in 2007 when he was only 13 and weighed 16st 8lb			2
despite losing 4 stone in weight , the teenager is now calling for a worldwide ban on children having drastic anti ‑ obesity procedures			0
‘ i just wish it was out of me , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve been through hell because of it			0
i think every doctor should refuse to do them on anyone under 18			2
a gastric band is not the answer to curing an overweight child			1
’ last year it was revealed that up to 20 children as young as 15 had invasive weight - loss surgery on the @entity119 in @entity38			2
added to this is the undocumented number of @entity38 children whose parents pay for the procedure privately , at a cost of between £ 5,000 and £ 8,000			0
dr @entity6 ( left ) says operations and drugs are now considered ' quick fixes ' many more children travel abroad with their parents to seek out cheap deals			0
like @entity9 , who had his operation in @entity133 , many of these children have n’t even completed puberty when they go under the knife			1
the @entity138 has expressed concern over the use of bands in young people			0
last year , a @entity138 report warned there had been little research into the use of these techniques on children , with their unique metabolic needs , concluding : ‘ surgical complications in this age group remain a concern			0
’ gastric band surgery involves fitting a band near the top of the stomach , restricting the amount of food that can enter , thus making the patient feel full			1
follow - up operations can adjust how much food is allowed to pass through			0
on @entity7 this morning , dr @entity6 , who joined @entity9 on the sofa , said : ' a gastric band is very much a last resort			1
@entity9 is a very unusual case to have had the operation at his age			1
' ' there is very strict criteria in the @entity38			0
though the tendency now is to consider drugs or operations a ' quick fix ' if you 're overweight , actually @entity9 's story shows although it worked for him if we can teach children and parents about lifestyle and exercise - although it 's a longer process - they 'll be better off in the long term			1
' when @entity15 asked about @entity9 's prospects if he has the band removed , whether he would be able to retain his figure , dr @entity182 said : ' hopefully the behavioural change will stay and he should be able to carry that on			1

at just 13 @entity9 became youngest @entity192 to get a gastric band

said it was ' best thing that had ever happened to him ' at the time
now , at 18 , says it has ' stopped working ' and gives ' unbearable cramps '
he wishes he never had it fitted and is *saving* up to get it removed
warns : ' exercise should be the way - and schools should help '
