by @entity0 police forces have been criticised for paying officers hundreds of pounds in ‘ macabre ’ bonuses for dealing with dead bodies			1
families of victims of accidents and crime are likely to be horrified that officers are profiting from their personal tragedies			0
police and civilian staff are paid compensation of up to £ 500 if they are sent to the scene of a car crash or murder , or have to take fingerprints from a corpse , according to figures obtained by @entity20			1
an estimated £ 100,000 is spent every year on the payments for ‘ outstandingly unpleasant ’ work , despite almost all other bonuses being scrapped in a recent review			1
gruesome : officers dealing with unpleasant crimes can receive £ 500 - totalling £ 100,000 a year critics say police should not be paid extra for just doing their jobs , and point out that neither paramedics nor firefighters get bonuses when they have to handle dead bodies			1
even train drivers who witness suicides are not automatically entitled to compensation			1
@entity37 , chairman of the @entity38 , vowed to quiz home secretary @entity39 over the issue this week			2
he said : ‘ i would have thought that dealing with these matters were part of the job and did not require additional payments			1
’ criminal justice expert @entity45 added : ‘ it ’s traumatic for anybody to deal with a fatality and the best way forward is to provide counselling rather than a pot of money			0
most victims ’ relatives would rather emergency services were given counselling than paid extra			0
’ until recently a bonus bonanza meant police across @entity60 and @entity61 received up to £ 150 million a year in a variety of extra payments , including ‘ professional competence ’ awards and ‘ special priority ’ cash if they took on extra tasks			1
almost all of these rewards were scrapped after a @entity72 review by lawyer @entity73 in 2011 , but he allowed the payments of £ 50 to £ 500 for ‘ outstandingly demanding , unpleasant or important ’ work to remain			1
but new details make it clear that ‘ unpleasant ’ tasks usually relate to the dealing with dead bodies			0
in a document obtained under the @entity83 , @entity81 states they may include ‘ handling of a badly decomposed body , dealing with an extremely difficult fatal road accident or investigating and extremely unpleasant offence or incident ’			0
@entity90 police provides payments of £ 50 for civilian staff who have to ‘ search / fingerprint dead body ’ and its guidance states : ‘ payment only for cases deemed to be particularly unpleasant , such as badly decomposed bodies ’			1
angry : @entity37 , chairman of the @entity38 , said he will quiz @entity39 this week it expects to pay out £ 1,000 in the current financial year for workers who have to handle corpses , as well as £ 45,000 to officers and teams who carried out demanding or important work as well as unpleasant tasks			1
this year , two constables were each given £ 200 when they attended the scene of a ' female on hard shoulder hit by vehicle ' @entity111 said it paid out about £ 2,000 for unpleasant work last year while @entity114 spent £ 1,900 , including three payments of £ 100 to officers who had to recover bodies			1
@entity118 paid out £ 2,700 in 2011 - 12 for unpleasant work			0
the most detailed breakdown came from @entity120 , which paid out £ 2,050 last year for ‘ exceptionally unpleasant ’ work ‘ over and above ’ normal duties			2
one pc received £ 250 for ‘ body retrieved from river which had been there for some time ’ , while a colleague got £ 200 when they ‘ attended murder / suicide scene and assisted with the removal of the bodies ’			2
two officers shared £ 400 to deal with ‘ male hit by train – body dismembered ’ and a sergeant got £ 200 when they were ‘ witness to man who shot himself in chest and then assisted medical staff in extreme circumstances ’			1
earlier this year two constables were each given £ 200 when they attended the scene of a ‘ female on hard shoulder hit by vehicle , body thrown some distance ’			2
in 2011 four officers received a total of £ 800 to handle an ‘ extreme decomposed body ’ while one pc got £ 250 when they had to attend ‘ suicide from bridge – hit by vehicles ’			2
if each of the 44 forces across @entity60 and @entity61 spent £ 2,000 on unpleasant work cases , it would mean a total annual cost of £ 88,000 but the figures are likely to be higher in larger areas and in for @entity160 , whose officers deal with suicides on railways			2
police forces budget for bonuses they plan to hand out to officers or civilians that have to deal with dead people @entity171 , the @entity172 mp who chairs the @entity173 on @entity174 , said last night : ‘ forces should be ensuring officers get proper support and any counselling they need , as should all those encountering distressing situations that ’s where the money should go			0
’ @entity183 said : ‘ bereaved family members and friends may find this particularly macabre at a time when they will be under incredible pressure			0
’ senior police have previously criticised bonus schemes as divisive and contrary to the culture of policing , and called for their abolition			0
but last night both the @entity194 , representing rank - and - file officers , and the @entity196 , defended the extra payments			0
@entity90 ’s deputy chief constable @entity198 , said : ‘ even within policing there are some tasks which even the most experienced officer can find emotionally draining and challenging			0
' these bonuses are not designed to reward officers for merely doing their day - to - day jobs , but to recognise when the task can try even the toughest emotional and professional resolve			0
’ @entity208 , vice-chairman of the @entity194 , added : ‘ police officers ’ remuneration should reflect the sometimes extraordinary tasks they are asked to perform			0

police get £ 500 bonus to attend a car crash , murder , or fingerprint a corpse
it amounts to £ 100,000 a year despite all other bonuses being scrapped
even train drivers who witness suicides do not get similar payments
@entity37 said : ' i would have thought these matters were part of the job '
