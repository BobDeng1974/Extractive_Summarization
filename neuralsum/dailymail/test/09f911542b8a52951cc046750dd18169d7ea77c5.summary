the family of one @entity2 veteran were thrilled to receive news from a stranger this week that their relative 's war medal had been unearthed in an east @entity8			1
@entity10 @entity9 was combing the park with his metal detector when he discovered a medal belonging to @entity14 , who served with the 23rd @entity16 @entity15 at @entity17 between 1914 and 1915			1
mr @entity9 posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum , which led him to @entity23 man @entity22 's great - nephew			1
' at first i thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something , ' mr @entity24 told @entity29			0
' i just could n't believe it - i thought wow - and then i was really confused			2
' rare find : @entity9 unearthed the @entity33 star medal when he was combing a @entity8 park with his metal detector last week			1
mr @entity24 , who has been researching his family history for ' a very long time ' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered			2
he thinks the inscribed medal does n't belong to @entity39 at all , but to his brother @entity40			2
' @entity41 never went to war			0
he 'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he would n't have been accepted to fight , ' said mr @entity24			0
' we think his younger brother @entity46 , who had a slight hearing problem , may have used his name to sign up			0
' it means that a grave in @entity8 's @entity51 bearing a plaque with @entity41 's name is probably not his either			1
instead , it records the date of @entity46 's death , or ' bunny ' as he was called in the family ' because he was so fast			2
' @entity24 recently discovered that @entity41 had actually died nine years before ' bunny ' in @entity60			0
@entity62 's plaque at @entity8 's @entity51 cemetery probably belongs to his brother @entity46 , who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing @entity62 ( left ) pictured with @entity24 's grandfather , @entity68 , and another brother , @entity69 @entity24 says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service			1
he says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to @entity33 from @entity81 - and that they all came back alive			1
the other brothers were @entity83 , who was awarded the @entity84 , and @entity85			0
according to national records , the 23rd battalion with which @entity87 served landed at @entity2 in september 1914			0
the troops manned @entity90 , ' one of the most trying parts of the @entity2 frontline ' until they left @entity84 in december 1915			0
@entity24 says his own grandfather - bunny 's brother - fought in the @entity96 in @entity97			1
' he was a machine - gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a @entity101 in @entity102 before making it back to @entity16 , ' @entity24 says			0
' somehow they all made it home			0
' from the archives : @entity39 ( left ) whose name is inscribed on the @entity33 medal , never joined the army because he lost two fingers ' blowing up fish ' before the war			1
the lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother , @entity116 @entity10 @entity9 says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of the @entity121 this weekend some of @entity9 's other finds with the silver war medal @entity10 @entity9 says he was ' blown away ' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year @entity126 anniversary			1
he says he found @entity24 after ' researching his heart out ' with other members of the @entity129 and @entity130 online forum			2
' definitely a roamer , ' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on @entity62 in the @entity136			0
' i found out that he was discharged from the @entity138 as medically unfit when he returned to @entity16 in 1917 , that he was diagnosed with @entity139 ( inflammation of the heart ) , ' @entity9 told @entity29			2
@entity9 also found letters from @entity22 's mother in @entity81 , appealing to the authorities for information about her son			1
' not knowing he whereabouts : ' @entity9 discovered this letter from @entity62 's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son did mrs @entity153 ever make contact with her son @entity41 or was she looking for bunny ? ' i do n't know , i do n't know if she even knew about the name swaps , ' says @entity24			1
' @entity158 's the only one from that era who would know - and i was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he 's 94 now and his memory is n't what it was			2
' for @entity24 , the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to ' @entity39 '			0
' this is the only one that has come to light , maybe the others are with his family , i do n't even know if he had children and if there 's other family out there , ' he says			0
@entity24 does n't know whether private @entity14 's mother ever made contact with her son , or his brother @entity116 , when they returned to @entity16 from the war @entity24 says he will proudly wear the newly - found medal , alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father , to the @entity188 rsl @entity126 dawn service this weekend			1
@entity9 says the discovery has ' made his year			1
' ' it made not just my day but my year when i found out that i could return the medal to a living relative			2
especially being the 100 year anniversary of @entity2 , ' he said			0
' all this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park ! lest we forget			0
