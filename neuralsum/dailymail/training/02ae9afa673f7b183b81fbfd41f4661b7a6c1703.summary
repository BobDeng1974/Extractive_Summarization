she responds to other kids and she will smile if other kids call out her name			0

we hope she will one day go to school			2
' the youngster , whose head circumference was reduced from 37ins to 23ins through major surgeries last year , can not yet walk because of the weight of her head			1
but she is able to crawl , eat , sleep and interact with her parents with much more comfort at their home in @entity59 , western @entity10			0
the family 's new hope comes more than a year after @entity7 was admitted to the @entity62 and @entity63 in @entity64 , on the outskirts of @entity9 , in april 2013			1
facing a huge medical bill , the couple were overwhelmed when images showing @entity7 's plight attracted international sympathy and prompted the hospital to treat her rare condition for free			1

he said : ' i see a lot of improvement , which i did n't expect			0
she has started laughing , she makes a lot of sounds and she occasionally speaks a few words			0
' she has gained a lot of weight and her activities have improved a lot			0
but whether she will be able to live a normal life , nobody can say			0
' but most likely i do n't think she will be absolutely normal because with such a severe case of hydrocephalus there has to be some damage to the brain			2
' but with the improvement she has shown we are hopeful she will be able to do some things			0
' a scan shows @entity7 's head now , after surgeons managed to reduce the size of her skull @entity7 , pictured left at 21 months old and right with her father @entity127 , 21 , is unlikely to ever make a full recovery , with experts warning she has probably suffered some brain damage @entity7 's progress has been so good that dr @entity80 now wants to proceed with yet another operation to further reduce the size of her head			1
but her concerned father @entity127 , 21 , who has seen her brought back from the brink several times , is worried about the risks			2

' but we say no. my wife says - " this is my baby			0
if she lives , she will live with us			0
if she dies , it will be my lap "			0
' ' so if the doctors can guarantee the surgery will definitely make her better and make her able to sit up , talk and be like a normal kid , then we would want it			2
' but if they can not give us that assurance , then we do n't need it			0
we would much rather let her be as she is			0
