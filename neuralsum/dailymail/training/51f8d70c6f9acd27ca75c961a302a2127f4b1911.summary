my daughter @entity0 ca n’t be more than six months old in the photo			0
propped up with cushions on the sofa , her chubby little fingers grasp not a favourite cuddly toy , but a cup of tea			1
moments earlier she ’d carefully , slowly , brought it to her lips for a sip			0
judging by the delighted look on her face , she clearly relished the brew			0
now seven , @entity0 still loves her cup of tea in the morning , and it ’s the same story for both her little brothers			1
he ca n’t stand the posh stuff , and woe betide if there are any tea leaves floating at the top			2
@entity32 , who has just turned four , likes his milky and sweet			0
i ’m mortified by their tea - drinking			2
my own mother would n’t have dreamed of letting me drink tea as a child growing up in @entity41 ; she considered it a social drink for adults , almost as taboo as alcohol			1
the reason my own children developed the habit is that we lived for the first few years of their lives on the @entity54 / @entity53 border with my mother - in - law — a granny who loved to have a natter with her grandchildren over a cuppa			0
from around the age of two , she ’d give them tea in the afternoon , which they ’d enjoy with a ginger biscuit or two			0
the tea was milky , tepid and laced with sugar			0
i did n’t like it , but it seemed rude to tell her she could n’t carry on a family tradition ; her own children had always enjoyed a ‘ hot drink ’ when they were young			1
shall i be mother ? six - month - old @entity0 takes a sip of tea also , as a ‘ soft @entity75 ’ , i felt i was being disrespectful to her culture			0
according to her , it ’s still common for young children to drink tea in the north of @entity82			1
even after moving hundreds of miles south to @entity85 in 2012 , my repeated attempts to wean my trio off tea have all ended in failure — partly because i am sabotaged when @entity89 comes to stay , and partly because the school run is hard enough without wailing children refusing to get in the car until they ’ve had their morning brew			1
but the subject of whether young children should have a cup is a hotly debated on many a parenting forum			1
‘ i really , really do n’t like seeing babies and toddlers drinking tea , and seeing it in a bottle is just awful ! ’ writes one mum			1
‘ i certainly wo n’t be encouraging my son to drink anything like that at home where he ’s happy with fruit juice , water or milk , ’ adds another			0
certainly at my local toddler group in rural @entity85 , i find myself in a minority of one when i queue for a beaker of tea for @entity32 at break - time			0
i ’ve noticed a few pointed looks as i hold out his sippy cup			0
at first glance , the case against giving toddlers tea does look pretty powerful			0
dietitian @entity122 , a spokesperson for the @entity123 , warns young children should n’t drink tea because it can interfere with the absorption of iron			1
‘ tea contains compounds , called polyphenols , which bind with iron , making it harder for our bodies to absorb it , ’ she explains			2
‘ iron deficiency causes symptoms such as tiredness and lethargy , and can make it harder to concentrate			2
’ tea for two : @entity23 and @entity0 enjoy the family ritual of drinking tea together for small children , this may also mean they reach developmental milestones late			1
@entity146 is vital for brain development , and children who lack iron may also fail to grow at the expected rate			1
but it ’s the caffeine in tea that is the biggest cause for concern			0
as well as being a stimulant , it can lead to calcium deficiency			1
studies suggest that drinking as little as two cups of tea a day can decrease your ability to absorb calcium — not a problem if you are an adult eating a healthy , balanced diet , but potentially an issue if you are a fast - growing child			1
@entity166 , the compound that gives tea its colour , also stains teeth			2
i have to admit that little @entity0 did have a bit of tea staining on her teeth , but it was simply polished off at the dentist ’s			2
but according to other experts , tea actually is a good drink for toddlers			2
health boost : experts say they are happy to recommend tea for pre-schoolers for a start , it may be beneficial to enamel because it contains fluoride that remineralises and hardens the tough outer coating of baby and adult teeth , according to @entity192 , dental adviser at the @entity193			2
‘ you could n’t use tea instead of toothpaste , but it has a reasonable amount of fluoride and could have a positive impact on teeth , ’ she says			2
of course , any benefit would be cancelled out if a child drank tea with sugar , which i have to admit is the case with @entity32 and @entity24 , who insist on at least one spoonful			0
but at least none of my children has ever had tea from a bottle , which is particularly damaging because it keeps the sugary liquid close to the teeth for longer , increasing the risk of decay			1
‘ only water and milk should be drunk from bottles , but tea from a cup would be fine , as long as it is sugar - free , ’ says @entity192			2
‘ make it milky to get the added benefit of calcium			0
’ a recent study in the @entity225 and @entity226 found that children who drank moderate amounts of tea ( up to two cups a day ) suffered no harmful effects			1
the small amounts of caffeine in two cups could even be beneficial , by increasing concentration in school or in sports performance			1
studies showing negative effects of caffeine on children , including anxiety and sleep problems , relate to high doses			1
a ten - year - old would have to drink 160mg per day of caffeine ( four to six cups )			0
tea is also a recognised source of flavonoids , plant compounds with proven health effects including boosting heart health			2
to my amazement dr @entity253 , the author of the study , says she is happy to recommend tea for pre-schoolers			0
enjoying a cuppa : like @entity20 and @entity23 , @entity261 's children @entity0 , @entity24 and @entity32 love a cup of tea in the morning dr @entity253 is also a member of the @entity265 , a body funded by the @entity268 tea industry to provide information on the health benefits of a cuppa			1
‘ up to a certain point , tea is an excellent drink for children , ’ she says			1
‘ but , like other caffeine - containing drinks , it should be consumed in moderation , with no more than two cups a day for a toddler			0
’ up to a certain point , tea is an excellent drink for children but it should be consumed in @entity284 according to dr @entity253 , tea — which is 99 per cent water — is an excellent way to hydrate children , and unlike bottled water contains many antioxidants , minerals and nutrients			1
‘ children who drink milky tea , as opposed to fizzy drinks and fruit juices , are getting a sugar - free source of fluids , ’ she says			1
for a caffeine - free alternative , try @entity299 tea			0
finally , there ’s the social aspect			0
@entity302 , 42 , an office administrator from @entity303 in @entity85 , says that daughters @entity20 , two , and seven - year - old @entity305 love to copy their mum and dad @entity307 , 38 , in a ‘ family ritual ’ of drinking tea			1
the girls started when they were still in nappies with very milky tea			0
@entity23 says : ‘ just think of truly harmful things , like junk food			0
’ as for me , now that i know a cup or two a day is unlikely to cause my three children long - term harm , i ’m certainly more relaxed			2
if only @entity24 and @entity32 would stop slipping in all that sugar .			0

@entity322 's three children love a cup of tea in the morning
@entity302 's young family have a ritual of drinking tea together
drinking tea can interfere with iron absorption , slow development and lead to calcium deficiency
but these effects only occur when children drink *copious* amounts of tea
in small doses tea helps teeth , builds concentration , hydrates and aids social development
