by @entity0 , city news editor published : 21:12 est , 11 november 2012 updated : 21:23 est , 11 november 2012 bankers who used to work for @entity3 are in line to collect a slice of the bonuses they were promised before the @entity8 institution collapsed , sparking the 2008 global financial crisis			1
the administrator to @entity3 's @entity12 operations has agreed to hand back an initial chunk of money to 1,582 creditors who are collectively seeking to recover £ 7billion			1
they will get about 25p for every pound they are owed			0
bonuses : former @entity3 bankers will get 25p for every pound owed @entity3 became one of the biggest casualties of the credit crunch after racking up billions in losses on sub-prime mortgages and commercial property investments			2
but the prospect of bankers who are blamed for causing the financial crisis still profiting from their actions prompted criticism last night			0
@entity33 , director of the @entity34 , said : ' bankers are always keen to help themselves			0
surely , there are other more deserving creditors ? after all , the bankers are the ones who caused the collapse in the first place			2
' the first round of payments could be followed by others as @entity46 sells off assets and recovers money owed to @entity3 before the bank went out of business , which forced the @entity51 into its largest - ever financial bailout			1
around 650 smaller creditors with claims of less than £ 150,000 have already opted to accept @entity46 's offer of a one - off payment of 90p in the pound to settle			2
another 689 cases with a combined value of £ 1.3bn have yet to be agreed due to their complex trading relationships with @entity3			2
profits : critics are unhappy with bankers blamed for causing the financial crisis profiting from their actions @entity46 's @entity67 said : ' the payment of this significant dividend to such a large number of @entity3 unsecured creditors is an important milestone for the administration			1
' we look forward to returning a substantial amount of cash to creditors later this month			0
' @entity67 has described his work unravelling the finances of @entity3 's @entity12 arm as a ' gargantuan task ' and ten times more complicated than dealing with the bankruptcy of collapsed energy trader @entity84			1
the bank had around £ 670billion of trades outstanding with more than 7,000 counterparties – buyers and sellers			0
it operated through more than 200 separate companies across the world , with 36 registered in the @entity94 alone			0
many of @entity3 's 4,500 staff in the @entity94 , mostly employed in @entity98 's @entity97 , lost their jobs despite @entity100 and @entity101 buying up parts of the collapsed firm , which was once one of @entity8 's most venerable institutions			1
most were also investors in the bank who saw the value of their holdings wiped out when it was decided to wind up the business .			0
