by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 10:16 est , 29 august 2012 a vast unexploded @entity2 bomb has brought chaos to the biggest airport in @entity5 disrupting the journeys of thousands of travellers - including many @entity8			1
builders digging around @entity10 at @entity11 uncovered the device wedged deep underground			1
it will lead to questions as to how a major airport used by 45 million people a year could have built over a live bomb			2
‘ this has had a big impact , ’ said an airport spokesman			0
‘ delays and cancellations are inevitable , and many people will be caught up in the problems			0
a major evacuation has already taken place			0
’ the spokesman said an army bomb disposal team had arrived at the scene after the discovery of the bomb soon after dawn today			2
because of the age of the device , it is likely to be many hours , if not days , before the bomb is declared safe and can be removed			2
the find comes after thousands of people were evacuated from their homes in @entity58 , @entity59 , as experts tried to defuse a 550lb @entity2 bomb found beneath ground at the site of the former @entity65 nightclub - a hangout of the @entity67 in the 1970s			1
the awesome power of the explosion gave an insight into the devastating impact of wartime bombing raids when thousands of tonnes of explosives were dropped by @entity76 aircraft			1
controlled blast : could the unexploded bomb found at @entity22 be detonated in a controlled explosion like a similar - sized device was yesterday in @entity58 , @entity59 ? menace : thousands of unexploded @entity2 bombs ( like this one found in @entity58 , pictured ) , are thought to be buried across @entity83 the spokesman warned passengers to check their flights before departure so as to avoid long waits at the airport			1
the bomb is thought to have been dropped by the @entity91 or @entity92 during raids between 1940 and 1944 , when @entity22 was used by the @entity59 @entity94			1
there were regular day and night raids on the then military airbase , especially because the @entity99 airforce could use it to launch raids on nearby countries including @entity8			2
@entity76 bombs weighing 550lb were regularly dropped , all containing complicated chemical fuses which could trigger at any time			1
the @entity91 and @entity107 dropped huge payloads of bombs on @entity99 positions all over the @entity111 , as part of the 2.8million tons used to flatten vast areas of @entity59 - occupied @entity83			0
this figure compares to the relatively small figure of 75,000 tons of bombs unleashed by the @entity94 on @entity8			0
even though the war ended 67 years ago , ordnance is still found all over @entity5 , just as it is in neighbouring countries such as @entity120 , and @entity59 itself			0
however , it is highly unusual to find a bomb in a heavily populated area like one of the world ’s biggest airports			0
some 48million people travel through @entity22 every year – ensuring that questions will be asked as to how one of its major terminals was allowed to be built on top of an unexploded bomb			1
a major enquiry is expected to be launched in to today ’s find .			0

@entity10 closed immediately after discovery of bomb
@entity22 is used by thousands of @entity8 travellers every year
device had laid under site since being dropped by @entity76 aircraft during @entity2
