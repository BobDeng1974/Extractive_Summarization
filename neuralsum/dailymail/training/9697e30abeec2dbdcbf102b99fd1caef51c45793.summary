internet service providers did not raise the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of fusilier @entity5 in the six months before his death , it has been revealed			1
the companies - who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services - failed to inform authorities about material posted by @entity14 before the attack he carried out with @entity16			1
it meant @entity18 missed internet messages that could have alerted them to the threat posed by the murderers			2
@entity14 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of @entity5			1
in the months before the attack , @entity14 had been posting extremist material on social media a long - awaited report by @entity30 ’s intelligence watchdog is expected to say @entity14 was posting extremist material on social media sites in the months leading up to the attack			1
the messages would have been sufficiently serious to justify the security services – who had had @entity14 on their radar for eight years – putting him under more detailed surveillance			1
but officers found out about them only after the sickening murder of the 25 - year - old soldier outside @entity42 in may last year			1
the @entity44 report is also expected to highlight a failed attempt by @entity18 to recruit @entity14 as a source – but , crucially , it will say that officials could not have prevented the attack on the day			1
the findings , due to be made public by the end of this month , come at a time of heightened concern about use of the internet and social media by would - be terrorists			2
earlier this month , the head of @entity58 accused firms such as @entity60 and @entity61 of turning into ‘ the command and control networks of choice ’ for terrorists			0
fusilier @entity5 was killed in @entity65 after crossing the road near his barracks @entity68 said some @entity70 - based tech firms were in denial about the misuse of their services by fanatics who could use them to facilitate mass murder			1
the @entity44 report is expected to say that @entity14 had been known to @entity18 for eight years			1
he was a regular member of a small group of fanatics closely linked to the extremist preacher @entity81			2
he was also pictured in violent scenes during a protest outside the @entity84 in 2006 and spent three months in prison in 2008 for assault			0
the key incident came when he was stopped in @entity88 where he had been caught trying to join the @entity90 terrorist group			0
he appeared in court in @entity88 but was not charged and returned home			0
his then - lawyer claimed he was freed on the recommendation of the @entity95 and avoided a formal deportation			0
@entity14 told the @entity84 there was ‘ more to the story ’			2
the report is expected to say the security services tried to recruit him as an informant but he rejected their approaches			1
officials argue that trying to recruit terror suspects and extremists is a vital part of @entity18 ’s work and that not every attempt will succeed			0
they also point out that , with several thousand islamists on @entity18 ’s radar , they are forced to prioritise on the basis of available intelligence			0
in a speech last year , director general @entity113 said it was impossible to stop all terrorist attacks			0
the evidence against @entity14 would have been enough for security services to justify more surveillance			1
the murder of @entity5 shocked the nation			2
a little boy places flowers near the site of his death in may 2013 he added : ‘ knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them			0
‘ being on our radar does not necessarily mean being under our microscope			0
the reality of intelligence work is that we only focus the most intense intrusive attention on a small number of cases at any one time			0
’ @entity14 , 29 , was sentenced to a whole - life term earlier this year			1
@entity16 , 23 , was jailed for a minimum of 45 years			2
it was the first successful terrorist attack on @entity143 soil since the july 7 suicide bombings on the @entity146 transport system .			0
