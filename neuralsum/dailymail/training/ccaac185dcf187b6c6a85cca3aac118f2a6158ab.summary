by @entity0 never mind mr @entity1 , the hit series chronicling the early years of the great department store			1
another retail empire , which began further along @entity6 's @entity5 from @entity7 , and much earlier , has an even more beguiling story			1
@entity9 is 150 years old this year , and its rich history is celebrated in an exhibition at the flagship @entity13			1
@entity9 celebrates 150 years of business this year were anyone to make a tv drama about @entity9 , it might include the aviator @entity18 , the murderer @entity19 and the wartime code - breaker @entity19			1
they all feature in the fascinating tale of how a single draper 's shop grew into a high street institution that is part and neatly wrapped parcel of @entity28 's consumer culture			1
the middle classes in particular have for generations been reliant on the @entity9 , as it became , and of course on @entity33 , the string of grocer 's shops that were gathered into the @entity9 fold in 1937			1
many of us were almost literally weaned on @entity9			1
in the exhibition there stands a handsome @entity42 pram , which might be a replica of the one that transported me 50 - odd years ago			0
my elderly mother still recalls going to @entity9 , in the form of its @entity49 outpost @entity50 , to buy a @entity42 for me			2
and the great childhood treat for my @entity53 wife @entity52 , brought up in @entity54 , was being taken for fancy afternoon teas at @entity57 's branch of @entity9 , @entity50			1
maybe it helps to be over 50 , but there must be millions of @entity28 for whom memories of @entity9 @entity9 aged 70 in 1910 and its grand provincial outposts offer such stabs of nostalgia			1
the story begins with @entity9 himself , born to a baker and his wife in @entity69 , @entity70 , in 1836			2
he was apprenticed to a draper in nearby @entity72 , but made his way to @entity6 and found a job in @entity75 with another draper , @entity77 , whose name would also become familiar to generations of @entity28 shoppers			2
in time @entity77 offered @entity9 a partnership , but @entity9 declined and , in 1864 , aged 28 , he set up his own draper 's shop , also on @entity5			1
he crammed his shop window with silks , laces , ribbons and bows , which he 'd bought cheaply so he could sell cheaply			0
that was his simple retailing philosophy			0
he reduced his overheads further by opting not to advertise , and the empire he founded would largely eschew mainstream advertising for more than a century			0
now , of course , @entity9 campaigns , such as the charming ' @entity95 & the @entity97 ' commercials last @entity98 , have themselves become iconic in their own right			2
there were other ways in which old man @entity9 kept his costs down			2
the exhibition is on the third floor of the flagship store , to which i ascended by lift			0
but not all @entity110 shoppers were so fortunate			0
the company 's archivist , @entity111 , told me that when the first lift was installed in 1893 , @entity9 used to stand nearby , mindful that it cost him a penny - farthing every time the new apparatus carried customers up or down			1
' so he would assess their physical state , and if he thought they were fit enough , he 'd send them up the stairs			0
' by the 1890s the shop had become much more than a draper 's , but in 1906 @entity9 bought an established department store , @entity126 in @entity127			1
@entity126 , another enterprising provincial draper , had died the year before and @entity9 seized his chance , walking the couple of miles from @entity5 to @entity132 with 20 Â£ 1,000 notes in his pocket to make the purchase in cash			1
in that same year , 1906 , @entity9 gave his 21 - year - old son @entity137 a quarter share of the business			2
@entity140 ( he was always known by his middle name ) had many radical management ideas - such as cutting hours and introducing tea - breaks - that were at odds with his father 's unyielding @entity110 principles			0
16s 4d @entity9 's takings on his first day in his new store on @entity5 1.1bn pounds in sales made on the @entity9 website last year , up 19.2 per cent on the previous year 43 @entity9 stores can now be found nationwide , along with 300 @entity33 stores he was grudgingly allowed to put some of them into practice at @entity126 , where he was made chairman			1
but @entity140 was not the only enlightened retailer in @entity6			0
in 1909 the @entity159 @entity1 opened his own department store , and allowed customers to wander round his magnificent premises unguided			2
this was revolutionary : at other department stores shoppers were escorted by floorwalkers who would introduce them to a sales assistant			1
old mr @entity9 would not countenance @entity1 's way of doing things , and he had similarly old - fashioned ideas about employment practices			1
in 1920 , 400 of his staff went on strike for better pay and conditions , but @entity9 simply sacked and replaced them			2
when he died in 1928 , aged 92 , his son took the reins			0
it was no coincidence that the @entity9 was inaugurated the following year , where profits were divided between the entire workforce , now known as ' partners '			2
@entity140 also introduced one of the first graduate training schemes			0
he liked to recruit ' learners ' himself according to their chess skills , and one of the finest players he recruited , @entity19 , was later seconded to @entity191 to help break the @entity193 code			0
another of @entity140 's young graduates was @entity18 , taken on in 1928 as a sales assistant and later to gain fame as a record - breaking aviator			0
due to @entity140 's clever recruitment the @entity9 prospered even while the rest of the nation 's economy suffered terribly in the 1930s			1
@entity140 planned a chain of @entity9 hotels , and in 1937 bought a string of ten grocery shops in the @entity6 area to supply them			2
this was @entity33 , which had been founded by @entity211 in 1908 ; @entity212 bailed out of the partnership early , denying himself a place in the annals of @entity28 food retailing			0
@entity217 was the accounts man			0
the visionary was @entity219 , a self - made grocer who by coincidence had been a pupil at @entity223 , like @entity9 before him			0
@entity33 quickly added to the @entity9 's success , although there was a setback in 1940 when the flagship @entity9 store was all but destroyed by @entity230 bombs			1
@entity140 's expansion plans continued unabated however , and that same year the @entity9 acquired a controlling interest in the ailing @entity233 , a group of 15 department stores @entity1 had set up in the 1920s - they included @entity50 , @entity235 on @entity236 , north @entity6 , and @entity237 of @entity238 , where ' @entity240 ' @entity239 herself once made hats for @entity243 ( and which remained milliner by royal warrant until it closed eight years ago )			1
in 1910 @entity235 helped seal the conviction of @entity19 , on trial at the @entity248 for murdering his wife			0
human remains had been found at his home in north @entity6 , but he claimed they dated from before he lived there			0
however , they were found buried with pieces of a man 's pyjama jacket bearing a @entity235 label , and the shop 's menswear buyer testified that those pyjamas had not been introduced until 1908 , well after @entity19 had moved in			0
today we 're all familiar with the white and green company colours , chosen it 's said because @entity140 wrote his thousands of memos in green ink			0
he was also said to be domineering and autocratic , but nevertheless he remains , like his father before him , an authentic hero of the @entity28 high street			0
@entity9 150 , @entity5 , @entity269 , until 31 august , www.johnlewis.com			1

it 's been 150 years since @entity9 opened its doors on @entity5
it has since become one of @entity28 's most *popular* department stores
its clientele has included royalty like @entity243
