by @entity0 @entity1 has signed a deal with three small cable - providers in the @entity4 to become a regular tv channel			1
the agreements with @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 gives the internet streaming site 's subscription service a channel on @entity14 boxes that the companies provide their customers			1
it will debut on @entity18 and @entity8 on monday and then will expand on to @entity20 's service by end of next month			0
breakthrough : the online streming service has signed a deal with three small cable providers , giving it a @entity14 channel collectively , the three services have around 820,000 subscribers scattered through nine states and @entity30 although it is a small fraction of the market , the deals represent another milestone for @entity1 as it tries to make its internet video service more like premium channels such as @entity38 and @entity39			1
the online streaming service has already been included on digital and satellite boxes in the @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , but has not been able to make similar inroads in the @entity4 until now			1
the company 's nearly 36 million @entity4 subscribers typically have to buy a separate device , such as games console or a specific device , if they want to stream video on to their tvs			1
that method usually requires a separate remote and an additional step to change to a different tv input			1
now , @entity1 will be like any other channel on the cable - tv dial , but will rely on a high - speed internet connection to deliver its video			1
' we think this signals a new generation of cable - tv service of offerings , ' said @entity66 , @entity18 's chief marketing and strategy officer			0
' it 's a watershed moment			0
' he likened what @entity1 is doing for internet video to what @entity38 did for cable - tv when that service began transmitting through satellites in the early 1970s			2
popular : the site , which has been responsible for dramas such as @entity79 , has around 36million subscribers in the @entity4 @entity1 has been striving to become more @entity38 - like since it expanded upon its dvd - by - mail service and began offering internet streaming seven years ago			1
in the past two years , the @entity84 , @entity85 , company has been featuring more original programming , such as the critically acclaimed @entity79 and @entity87 to persuade more @entity4 subscribers to pay $ 8 per month for its service			1
to help pay for its rising programming costs , @entity1 plans to raise its prices by $ 1 or $ 2 by july			0
the higher tariff will initially only impact new customers			0
@entity38 , which is owned by @entity95 , views @entity1 as such a threat that it has steadfastly refused to licenses its old tv shows , such as @entity99 and @entity100 , to the internet video service			2
those @entity38 shows instead will be streamed through a rival internet video service offered through @entity104 's prime shipping service as part of deal announced earlier this week			2
' @entity38 fears @entity1 's growing industry power , ' @entity109 analyst @entity108 wrote in a thursday blog post			2
competition : with original programmes such as @entity87 , @entity113 is trying to rival premium streaming services such as those used by @entity38 ' we suspect @entity38 wanted to balance @entity1 's growing media industry hegemony by helping to bolster their largest direct - to - consumer competitor â€” @entity104			2
' unlike their partnerships with @entity38 and @entity39 , the cable - tv providers are n't offering a @entity1 subscription as part of their bundled packages			0
people will still have to open a @entity1 account through the company 's website or mobile application , although @entity18 is trying to make that process easier by offering a way to sign up on the tv screen			0
@entity1 is still hoping to be added to the programming lineup of a major cable - tv service			0
it seems unlikely that @entity1 will make its way onto a cable box offered by the biggest service , @entity138 any time soon			0
the relationship between the two companies has grown frosty because @entity1 is opposing @entity138 's proposed $ 45 billion purchase of another major cable - tv service , @entity143			0

internet streamers have made agreement with @entity7
breakthrough *acknowledges* growing popularity of online television
site has already made inroads into @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 markets
@entity4 has nearly 36million subscribers , who have to use separate devices
