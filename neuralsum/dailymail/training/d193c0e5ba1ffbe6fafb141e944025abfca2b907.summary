by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:30 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 20:30 est , 10 october 2013 it was just a few short years ago when the @entity4 government was forced to bailout the auto industry , and now the tables have turned - the @entity4 government currently has less cash on hand than at least one automaker , as well as eight other @entity13 companies			1
as politicians in @entity15 continue their seemingly endless debate on whether to raise the country 's debt ceiling ( the amount of debt lawmakers authorize the @entity21 to enter into ) , the @entity4 is running out of money to pay the bills it 's already incurred			1
at the moment , the @entity21 has only $ 32 billion in its operating accounts			0
in contrast , @entity26 currently has nearly three times that amount of accessible cash - currently , @entity26 has more than $ 88 billion in cash - on - hand			1
poorhouse : the @entity4 government currently has less money than nine @entity35 500 companies according to a graph created by @entity37 , @entity26 tops the list of companies with more moulah than the @entity4 government			1
also on that list is @entity42 with $ 77 billion , @entity43 with nearly $ 55 billion and @entity44 with $ 50 billion			1
@entity45 also made the list with $ 36 billion ( @entity45 is one of the few domestic automakers that did not accept bailout money )			0
@entity48 - which received nearly $ 50 billion in bailout cash from the @entity4 government starting in 2008 - now trails the federal government in cash - on - hand by a mere $ 3 billion ( @entity48 currently has $ 27 billion in its coffers )			1
on thursday , house speaker @entity53 announced that @entity54 would vote to extend the government 's ability to borrow money for six weeks — but only if president @entity58 first agrees to fresh negotiations on spending cuts			1
under the @entity54 plan , the partial government shutdown would continue in the meantime			2
@entity65 spokesman @entity64 said that @entity58 ' would likely sign ' a clean bill increasing the debt cap but that the president also wants republicans to reopen the government			2
he did not rule out @entity58 agreeing to @entity53 's debt ceiling proposal if the government remains closed , but the @entity65 made no promises that @entity58 would hold negotiations under those circumstances			1
' he will not pay ransom in exchange for the @entity54 in the @entity65 doing their job , ' @entity64 said			0
@entity58 is to meet with @entity53 and other @entity65 @entity54 leaders at the @entity65 thursday afternoon			1
debt : house speaker @entity53 said thursday that the @entity65 would consider increasing the debt ceiling after weeks of decline , financial market indexes shot higher in anticipation of a possible deal that could avert a federal financial default			1
both the @entity86 industrial average and @entity87 were up well over 1 percent in afternoon trading i would hope the president would look at this as an opportunity and a good faith effort on our part to move halfway , halfway to what he 's demanded , in order to have these conversations begin , ' @entity53 , @entity89 , told reporters after presenting the plan to rank - and - file @entity54 lawmakers			2
@entity53 produced his proposal as the shutdown entered its 10th day			2
on that front , the administration said it would allow states to use their own money to reopen some national parks that have been closed			0
governors in at least four states — @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 — have asked for authority to reopen national parks within their borders because of the economic impact of the closures			0
interior secretary @entity121 said the government will consider offers to pay for park operations but will not surrender control of national parks to the states			2
in the money : @entity43 is one of nine companies that currently has more money than the @entity4 government as for the deeper problem of the federal debt ceiling , the administration has warned that unless the limit is raised , the government will deplete its ability to borrow money by next thursday , an event officials have warned could trigger a default that could wound the world economy as well as @entity4 's			1
@entity58 has steadfastly insisted that @entity143 reopen the government and extend the debt limit without conditions			1
his acceptance of the @entity54 proposal could mean a brief resolution to the fight over the debt limit and a continuation of the shutdown while negotiations proceed			1
republicans have been demanding cuts in government programs , including @entity58 's 2010 health care law , and a bigger effort to cut long - term federal deficits as their price for reopening government and extending the debt limit			1
@entity58 has repeatedly noted recent improvement in the deficit figures			0
after four years of trillion - dollar deficits , the 2013 shortfall is expected to register below $ 700 billion			0
some conservatives still expressed reservations with the @entity53 plan			2
' i 'm not very enthusiastic about that , ' rep. @entity171 , @entity172 , said			0
under @entity53 's offer , the @entity65 would also appoint negotiators to bargain with the @entity178 - led @entity177 over a budget compromise			2
those talks have been on hold for months , and the two chambers have deep differences over taxes and cuts in benefit programs			0
@entity187 ' : with $ 77 billion in cash - on - hand , @entity42 has more than double the amount of money as the @entity4 government earlier thursday , treasury secretary @entity192 warned the @entity193 that failure to renew the government 's ability to borrow money ' could be deeply damaging ' to financial markets and threaten @entity4 ' jobs and savings			1
it would also leave the government unsure of when it could make payments ranging from food aid to @entity206 reimbursements to doctors , he said			0
' the @entity4 should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens , ' the secretary said			2
' there is no way of knowing the irrevocable damage such an approach would have on our economy and financial markets			0
' the game of @entity15 chicken over increasing the debt limit — required so @entity21 can borrow more money to pay the government 's bills in full and on time — had sent the stock market south , spiked the interest rate for one - month treasury bills and prompted @entity231 , the nation 's largest manager of money market mutual funds , to sell federal debt that comes due around the time the nation could hit its borrowing limit			1
at the finance committee hearing , @entity192 met incredulity from @entity54 , who said the bigger problem was the soaring costs of benefit programs like @entity244 and @entity206 and the long - term budget deficits the country faces			0
many expressed doubt about @entity192 's description of the consequences of default			0
bling , bling : @entity26 - with nearly $ 90 billion in the bank - has nearly three times the amount of money as the @entity4 government sen. @entity257 , @entity258 , said , ' i think this is 11th time i 've been through this discussion about the sky is falling and the @entity263 will erupt			1
@entity265 families are n't buying these arguments			0
' replied @entity192 , ' after they run up their credit card , they do n't get to ignore it			0
' meanwhile , the @entity177 gave final congressional approval to a bill ensuring that families of fallen troops be paid death benefits , which have been halted during the shutdown			0
word that those payments had stopped prompted lawmakers of both parties to act to restore them			0
in addition , the @entity65 voted 249 - 175 to finance border security and customs personnel through dec. 15 , the latest of the @entity65 @entity54 's bills aimed at reviving selected programs during the shutdown			2
the @entity177 has ignored most of the measures , saying the entire government must be restarted .			0

@entity26 , @entity43 and @entity42 are three of the nine @entity35 500 companies that currently have more cash - on - hand than the @entity4 government
if the federal government does n't raise the debt ceiling , it soon wo n't be able to pay the bills it already has incurred
house speaker @entity53 announced thursday that he would consider raising the debt limit
