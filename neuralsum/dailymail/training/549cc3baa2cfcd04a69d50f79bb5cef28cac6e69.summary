by @entity0 the owner of one of @entity5 's oldest family - run market stalls has finally closed his market stall after 163 years of business			1
located in @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , has sold handbags and purses to hundreds of thousands of customers since its opening in 1851 and has been run by more than seven generations of the same family			2
now known as @entity19 , it had been passed down from father to son with the latest owner being @entity23			1
@entity23 will see his beloved stall close after 163 years of trading when @entity19 originally opened way back in 1851 , business was booming			1
however , after customers dwindled to just nine a day , @entity23 says the family have struggled to meet even the service charge			1
@entity23 says that his small family stall has n't been able to compete with nearby supermarkets , shopping centres and online shops that offer the same stock for a much cheaper price			1
@entity23 , 52 , says that the way we shop has completely changed since the stall opened and unfortunately @entity19 could n't keep up			1
' there is too much competition			0
everything we sell is now on the high street or in a supermarket , when years ago there was n't anything like that			0
' @entity23 said , explaining that it was n't just @entity19 that was suffering			1
founder of the stall @entity52 and his brother are pictured outside their stall in 1906 ( far right ) smiths was opened by @entity52 in the @entity57 in 1851 , left and right show the stall 85 years into business in 1936 ' markets have been going downhill for years - we just ca n’t compete with the big retailers any more			1
when it comes to offering a bargain , stall holders are n't even in the same league			0
' and when it comes to quality , people can pick up good bargains online these days or they can head to an out - of - town retail park - which will offer free parking right outside the shop you want			0
' why would you put yourself through the hassle of driving to the city centre , paying extortionate parking fees and then looking round the market ? we ’ve just had to accept that things have changed - and we ’re getting out now			0
' for @entity23 the closing of the stall is n't just a financial loss , but a sentimental one too			2
he grew up in the hustle and bustle of @entity86 , taking over from his dad @entity87 30 years ago			0
@entity23 and his wife @entity88 ( pictured ) say they can no longer compete with the high street and online retailers @entity23 even met his wife @entity88 , also 52 , at the stall when she was employed by his parents - she continued to work there for 36 years			1
@entity88 agrees that their small stall has no chance of competing with the multi-million pound brands that offer the same stock			2
there used to be customers four or five deep , it was buzzing and there was a lot of camaraderie , ' says the 52 - year - old			0
' but back then there was no @entity111 or anything , the market was all there was			0
now there is too much retail and everybody is taking a little bit			0
' @entity23 admits that the business has been sinking for a long time and says that he has already spent too much trying to keep the stall afloat			1
for @entity88 the closure of the shop will be deeply personal - she 's worked there for 36 years and met her husband there when she was employed by his parents at the age of 16 ' it ’s sad to say , but i ’ve thrown away as much money as i can for sentimental reasons and now we ’ve got to accept the way it is			1
' they say business has struggled since the market was moved to the new @entity139 site in @entity8			2
' we said we would give the new market a try - but the reason we think it has n’t worked is there 's no real demand for markets now , ' says @entity23			2
he added that smaller towns may still have a need for a market but he would n't be surprised if they disappeared in urban areas altogether			0
' it might not be the case in more rural areas , where people rely on a market , but in large cities markets could soon be a thing of the past			0
' @entity159 said it is looking at changing opening hours so as many people as possible can shop there			0
@entity163 , council cabinet member for business , said three new traders had joined the market and three more had doubled the size of their stalls			0
@entity163 added that the council would not give up on their local traders , ' we will continue to support all traders and help them promote their businesses to the people of @entity8			2
' smiths will close for the final time on saturday , june 28			1
the family said it would be a sad day , and thanked customers			0
smiths will close for good on saturday 28th june			1
