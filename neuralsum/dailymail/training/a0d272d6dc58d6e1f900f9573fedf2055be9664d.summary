by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:51 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:15 est , 24 december 2013 the names of a doctor and a nurse will be displayed above every hospital bed to stop patients being ' passed from pillar to post '			1
the move – announced today by health secretary @entity10 – will allow patients and families to know where the buck stops			1
the idea of identifying individual doctors and nurses has all but died out after once being commonplace in the @entity18			1
health secretary @entity10 has called for the names of a doctor and a nurse will be displayed above every hospital bed bringing it back was a key recommendation of the @entity25 inquiry into the deaths of hundreds of patients in the @entity29 scandal			1
writing in today 's @entity30 , mr @entity10 says : ' a name you know and a face you trust to guide you throughout your stay can transform your experience			1
' @entity25 , who led the inquiry into @entity29 , said this was an important change that would help make sure such events never happened again			0
this year , we will ask every hospital to make it happen			0
' he said patients in hospitals that used the system ' did n't worry about being passed from pillar to post '			1
campaigners complain that patients are often bewildered by repeated staff changes , which can also hamper continuity of care			1
the new system will not mean patients will see only one doctor or nurse throughout their stay – deemed impractical in a 24 - hour health service that treats millions			1
under the plans , individual doctors and nurses will be identified for patients so they know where the buck stops with their treatment instead , the named clinicians will act as a ' champion ' for their care			1
they will also be the first point of contact for a patient or relative with any concerns – and the buck will usually stop with them			1
' if things go wrong , obviously that will need investigation to see who was responsible , ' said a government source			0
' so if a surgeon made a mistake , the named nurse would n't be held responsible			2
but they are the first port of call and accountable to patient and family for the overall hospital experience			2
' other measures being introduced to improve patient care include a system to blacklist failed managers from taking further @entity18 jobs			1
the named clinician will be the first point of contact for a patient or relative with any concerns ¿ and the buck will usually stop with them this would end the ' @entity100 ' of executives who move from post to post despite a poor track record			1
the contracts of senior managers will in future include a clause linking their performance to the quality rating of their hospital			0
incompetent bosses could then be sacked without big pay - offs			0
a new chief inspector will hand hospitals @entity115 - style ratings from outstanding to poor			0
hospitals will additionally have to declare ward staffing levels			0
' every care setting is different and for this to work effectively this must be something which is carefully implemented , and supported by the right staffing levels			2
' @entity124 , of the @entity125 the government is introducing a new criminal offence for @entity18 staff who supply or publish false or misleading information – a change designed to prevent cover - ups			2
more senior consultants are to work at weekends and scanning departments will be kept open to try to improve care for patients treated on saturdays and sundays			1
professor @entity136 , president of the @entity137 , said : ' the return to having the name of the responsible doctor and responsible nurse above every bed is welcomed			0
' it is only right and proper that every patient knows who is accountable for their care			1
the surgeon is the advocate for the patient and this relationship is built on trust			2
' we must do all we can to continue to deserve this trust by ensuring any problems are raised and addressed early			0
the surgeon - patient relationship will be further strengthened by the publication of information on the outcomes of surgery			2
' this has been shown not only to improve surgical standards but to enable patients to have more informed conversations with their surgeon			2
' sir @entity165 , president of the @entity166 , said : ' the health secretary is right to focus on creating a supportive and transparent culture in the @entity18			0
' one of the @entity166 's key recommendations to the @entity171 was that every patient should have a named consultant responsible for their care			1
' we welcome this call from the health secretary , and also we believe it will help to improve patients ' experience of healthcare			2
' @entity124 , of the @entity125 , said the new policy recognised that nurses were at the centre of patient care			1
however , he added : ' every care setting is different and for this to work effectively this must be something which is carefully implemented , and supported by the right staffing levels			2
' by @entity10 , health secretary secretary of state for health @entity10 wrote in today 's @entity30 about his plans for the @entity18 the @entity30 has campaigned fearlessly in the last few years for greater accountability in our nhs			1
i 'm determined this will happen in 2014			0
in the wake of @entity29 , we have introduced a tough new barring scheme to stop failed managers from popping up in other parts of the @entity18 , and we are passing a new law to make wilful neglect of patients a crime			2
but our plans for greater accountability are mainly about giving patients a guarantee of compassionate care			1
the @entity18 is one of the biggest employers and largest organisations in the world , but i am convinced it can still provide a personal service			0
doctors and nurses enter healthcare out of a passion for helping people			1
for most , the personal interaction with patients and thrill of helping make people better is what brings real job satisfaction			2
for patients too , a human touch can make all the difference			2
a name you know and a face you trust to guide you throughout your stay can transform your experience			0
that 's why we are committing to put the names of a responsible nurse and responsible doctor above every hospital bed			1
@entity25 , who led the inquiry into @entity29 , said this was an important change that would help make sure such events never happened again			0
the medical royal colleges agree this is the type of thing that the best hospitals do for their patients			2
this year , we will ask every hospital to make it happen			0
a handful of our leading hospitals are already doing this			0
i 've seen first hand at places like @entity255 and @entity256 what a difference this makes to patients			0
they do n't worry about being passed from pillar to post between different departments on different days of the week , because they have one face and one name who champions their needs as long as they 're in hospital			0
this is a key part of the wider change i 'm trying to introduce in the @entity18 : insisting the buck stops with someone for every patient in every part of the @entity18 for every hour of the day			0
we are working to make sure that patients in hospital at the weekend can get to see senior doctors just like they can during the week			1
@entity18 medical director professor sir @entity280 has just announced that a greater number of senior doctors will work at weekends , and that x-ray , ultrasound , @entity285 and @entity287 departments will be kept open			0
this year we have taken even bigger strides to make sure the buck stops with someone for patients outside hospital			0
last month we tore up @entity294 's 2004 gp contract , which so disastrously broke the personal link between gps and patients			1
instead of being plagued by pointless targets , @entity296 will now use their time to provide proactive , personal care for elderly patients			1
starting with the over 75s from this april , we are bringing back the named gps that @entity294 abolished			0
this is a long overdue return to the family doctor			0
whether they are in or out of hospital and whatever day or time it is , patients need to know who is responsible for looking after them			0
the vast majority of patients in this country see the best doctors and nurses , in the finest hospitals , as part of the fairest health system in the world			1
by introducing individual accountability and increasing the personal , human touch , we will make it better still in 2014 .			0

campaigners complain patients are often bewildered by staff changes
but new *proposals* by @entity10 will try to put an end to that
identifying individual doctors and nurses was once commonplace
now , the named clinicians will act as a ' champion ' for a patient 's care
