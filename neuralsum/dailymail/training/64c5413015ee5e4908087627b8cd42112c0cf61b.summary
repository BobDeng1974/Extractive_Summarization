by @entity0 published : 21:33 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 1 february 2013 the number of people detained under the @entity3 is on the rise one in every 25 mentally ill patients who have been sectioned have ' irregularities ' in their records which could mean they are being unlawfully detained , the health watchdog has warned			1
of 4,500 patient records checked by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) between 2011 and 2012 , 4 per cent contained mistakes which called the legality of their detention into question			1
the number of people detained under the @entity3 is on the rise			1
people with mental disorders can be detained to ensure they get the treatment they need for their own health or safety , or for the protection of other people			1
in 2011/12 the number of men and women sectioned in @entity28 reached 48,600 - a five per cent rise on the previous year			1
in its annual @entity3 report the @entity11 also raised concerns that patients were not informed of their right to see a lawyer			1
the report says one in five patients were not informed of their right to see an independent mental health advocate			1
officials also said they were worried about cultures where ' control and containment are prioritised over the treatment and support of individuals '			0
the report says : ' the human rights of patients are often affected by controlling practices that only seem to serve the hospital ’s needs			2
' hospitals have a difficult task in balancing the realities of detention and compulsory treatment with the requirement that they provide services according to a principle of least restriction on patients			2
' but it has proved all too easy for cultures to develop in which blanket rules deny people their basic rights - especially the right to dignity			2
' the @entity11 said hospitals should ensure there are no ' blanket rules ' which deny patients autonomy and dignity			0
the health watchdog also said it was worried about the strain on @entity78 found that one in 16 wards had more patients than beds and 10 per cent were operating at full capacity			1
but some patients have ' irregularities ' in their records which could mean they are being unlawfully detained ' pressures on beds continued to put services and patients under stress , making it harder to provide appropriate care for people in times of crisis , ' the report says			1
' in 2011/12 , 93 wards ( 6 per cent of all wards ) visited had more patients than beds ; a further 10 per cent were at full capacity			0
' the report added : ' patients are being affected by reductions in staff numbers			0
for example , @entity3 commissioners raised concerns in 77 visits that a lack of staff prevented patients taking escorted leave			1
' the @entity11 said mental health services must do much more to ensure the care they provide for detained and non-detained patients in mental health hospitals is based on individual needs			1
@entity11 chief executive @entity119 said : ' people who need treatment in hospital for their mental health should have care and support to help them recover			1
the health watchdog is also worried about the strain on services			0
experts found that one in 16 wards had more patients than beds and 10 per cent were operating at full capacity ' some hospitals are doing a very good job in treating people with dignity and respect - so we know it ’s possible			2
however , @entity11 is concerned that some hospitals have allowed cultures to develop where control and containment are prioritised over treatment and care			0
' this applies as much to detained patients as well as to those who are receiving treatment on a voluntary basis			2
' in fact it is even more important people can be compulsorily treated - greater attention needs to be paid to ensuring as much dignity and choice as possible is promoted			0
boards , providers and commissioners of service need to ensure that the proper safeguards and care practices are available to patients			0
' our report has found too many instances where people have been restricted inappropriately			0
it is unacceptable for the current situation to continue			0
' all patients , whether detained under the @entity3 or not , need to be involved in their own care and consulted on their own wishes and desires			1
clinical staff must be trained in assessing and recording patients ’ capacity and consent			0
” dr @entity178 , chief executive at the @entity179 , said : ' it ’s frustrating to see that the findings provided by the report remain pretty much the same year after year in showing large over-representation of certain black and minority ethnic groups			0
' a lot of work has been done to identify the specific problems that need to be addressed , but neither government nor providers seem willing to make the long - term commitment to working with local communities that will be required to deliver change			0
' finally , we are very concerned by the reported lack of understanding of the @entity196 amongst many staff			0
urgent work is needed to educate those responsible for implementing this @entity3 on the ground			2
