by @entity0 for @entity1 an innocent young couple found themselves wrongly accused of shoplifting after bungling police issued a cctv ' wanted ' photograph of the pair to the public			1
@entity6 shots of @entity11 and @entity13 shopping in their local boots with their three - year - old son were sent to the media as part of a ' caught on camera ' appeal			1
they were accompanied by a description of the pair and details of how they stashed stolen goods in their toddler 's pushchair			2
@entity13 and @entity30 , were shopping in their local boots in @entity33 when they were filmed on cctv staff at the supermarket wrongly identified the couple , who were with their young son , as a pair of shoplifters boots staff passed on images of the @entity13 family to @entity45 and @entity46 police who issued an alert the release also came with the warning to the public not to approach the couple who were suspected of similar raids at other boots stores			1
mrs @entity30 , 22 , who works for the @entity55 , knew nothing about the investigation until a friend texted her a link to the picture on a local newspaper 's website			1
by then it had been published for more than 24 hours and had been shared 250 times on @entity65 - with users branding her a thief and a ' bad mum '			1
horrified , mrs @entity30 protested to @entity45 and @entity70 who have since withdrawn the appeal and promised to review procedures on witness appeals			1
the force issued the black and white cctv after several items went missing at a boots in @entity33 , @entity45 , on june 29			2
officers were said to be hunting a ' white male , with a shave head and white t - shirt ' and a ' white female with long black hair , white top with large number on chest , black short skirt			2
' shocked friends of the couple spotted the warning on a @entity65 page and alerted to them to the story the two suspects were alleged to have walked inside then ' concealed items in a push chair ' before leaving ' without making payment			1
' police went on to say the same pair were believed to be behind a spate of similar thefts at boots stores across @entity45			1
the appeal ended with the warning : ' members of the public should not approach anyone who they believe to be displayed in the images			2
' mrs @entity30 , right , said she was ' devastated ' to be accused of shoplifting as she has never done anything wrong in her life and works very hard mrs @entity30 said she and carpet fitter husband @entity13 , 30 , are now worried about leaving their home in @entity116 , @entity45 , in case they suffer abuse			1
she said : ' it was horrific , we were so shocked			2
it 's broken us both , we 're so upset			0
we both work really hard for our money and would never steal anything			0
' the photo is really clear and we are recognisable in it			0
and for my son to be pictured too , is just awful			0
' i did n't know what to do , i felt like i could n't leave the house			0
it 's caused us so much stress , i have n't slept much or eaten properly			0
' it 's disgusting how this mistake could have happened to innocent people			0
' seeing everything which was written about me , including that i was a bad mum , has been so upsetting			0
' we work hard for our money and would never do something like this			0
' @entity45 and @entity70 promised to review their ' @entity141 ' scheme to prevent a similar mistake - but stopped short of apologising to @entity143 and mrs @entity30			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity145 have been made aware of the release of an image in relation to the investigation of a shoplifting offence			2
subsequently it appears that the image was incorrect and was withdrawn			0
' the image was released through the ' @entity141 ' scheme , which is used to trace unidentified individuals during investigations			0
' such images are published when the police have been unable to identify the individuals through any other means , relying on the public to help with our enquiries			1
' this particular incident will be subject to review to ensure that our procedures are robust and comply with legislation and current procedures			0
' now the couple want a public apology from @entity45 and @entity70 following the highly embarrassing blunder			1
@entity45 and @entity70 have since withdrawn the alert and now the couple want a full public apology mrs @entity30 said : ' we were told that @entity173 handed the disc to the police but it was the wrong footage			1
we do n't know anything more than that			0
' the pictures have been in the local paper and on the @entity145 website for weeks			0
' they have acknowledged the mistake but they have n't apologised			0
i think both boots and the police should publicly apologise			1
' someone saw it on @entity65 and commented that stealing was bad enough , but to do it with a child was even worse - what kind of example are you setting the child ? ' ' it 's devastating because we 've worked so hard to get where we are in life and we would never do anything wrong			2
' boots said the company did not want to comment .			2
