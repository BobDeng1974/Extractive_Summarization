rat - like multituberculates filled a multitude of ecological niches and survived on @entity9 for more than 100million years			1
eventually they were replaced by more modern rodents , but no other mammal has had such a long history in the fossil record , according to scientists			1
the newly discovered species , @entity17 , is thought to be the oldest ancestor in the multituberculate family tree the newly discovered species , @entity17 , is thought to be the oldest ancestor in the multituberculate family tree			1
despite living before the heyday of the dinosaurs , the creature already bore many of the features that made its descendants so successful			2
the ancient creature , found in eastern @entity29 , had teeth adapted to eating both plants and animals , and highly rotatable ankle joints			0
when a ' mass extinction ' event wiped out the dinosaurs some 65million years ago , the multituberculates survived			1
how ? they adapted to eating angiosperms - flowering plants			0
the multituberculates evolved into a diverse group of animals ranging in size from that of a mouse to a beaver			0
they only eventually vanished from the @entity9 about 34million years ago after losing out to other mammals such as primates , hoofed species and rodents			1
multituberculates were distributed across the world and more than 200 species are known , some as small as the tiniest of mice and the largest the size of beavers			2
some , such as @entity59 from @entity29 , lived in burrows like prairie dogs while others , such as the @entity63 , climbed trees as squirrels do today			0
dr @entity66 , from the @entity67 , a member of the @entity70 and @entity29 team who described the find in the journal @entity74 , said : ' the later multituberculates are extremely functionally diverse			0
' some could jump , some could burrow , others could climb trees and many more lived on the ground			0
' the tree - climbing multituberculates and the jumping multituberculates had the most interesting ankle bones , capable of " hyper - back - rotation " of the hind feet			0
' what is surprising about this discovery is that these ankle features were already present in @entity17 , a land - dwelling mammal			1
' the fossil 's teeth were very similar to those of @entity94 multituberculates from @entity95 , dr @entity66 added			2
this suggested that the animals spread themselves across the whole of @entity99			0
@entity17 measured about 6.5 inches , not including its tail , and would have been most active at night			1
the location of the fossil bones suggests that the creature found by scientists lived on the shores of a lake .			2

@entity109 filled a multitude of ecological niches and survived on @entity9 for more than 100million years
the newly discovered species is called @entity17
no other mammal has had such a long history in fossil record
