three million motorists face being caught on camera and fined as @entity3 ’s busiest toll road dispenses with traditional toll - booths			2
from the end of this month , the @entity6 crossing over the @entity7 – used by up to 50 million vehicles a year at a rate of up to 170,000 a day - will operate a ‘ free flow ’ system without barriers			1
instead of handing over the fee in case , motorists must pay online or by phone before they use the crossing or on an electronic system - similar to that used for the @entity21 - after			1
if a car driver fails in time to pay the new £ 2.50 toll – up 50p the current cost of £ 2.00 – he or she will be fined automatically up to £ 105			1
failure to pay online or by phone by midnight of the following day will , when ‘ free - flow ’ goes live , result in a penalty charge of £ 35 if paid within 14 days , £ 70 up to 28 days and £ 105 thereafter			1
up to one in 14 of vehicles using the crossing are expected not to pay , according to an impact assessment carried out last year			1
the @entity45 fears many unwitting drivers will be caught out , especially if they are only occasional users			2
mistakes on the @entity34 number plate recognition system could also mean many drivers unfairly penalised			1
the tolled crossing is used by millions of families from across @entity3 as they head on holiday or to the continent			2
but a recent @entity45 poll showed that 85 per cent of members were unaware that they will have to pay by phone or online			1
the road will dispense with traditional toll booths and instead use a vehicle recognition system to check motorists have paid ( file picture ) even locally , 16per cent of drivers directly affected by the new charging system are unaware of it			1
@entity68 company @entity67 has a 10 - year contract worth up to £ 367million to run the system for the government , which retains ownership of the tolled crossing across the @entity74 which opened originally in 1991			1
the @entity75 says all profits from tolling will go to the @entity78 but must , by law , be spent on transport - related projects			0
however the @entity45 says motorists are furious because the cost of the tolled crossing was paid off by motorists in 2003			0
the toll continued because the @entity71 said a continued charge was necessary to ‘ restrict demand ’ for it			0
the @entity75 says , of the 50million vehicles using the crossing each year , 43 million will be within the 6am to 10pm charging period			2
with up to 7 per cent of these likely to be fined , that means around 3 million a year face a ticket			0
the @entity75 says changes in the way payments are made will come into effect on sunday november 30 – just as the new higher charges come into effect			0
@entity45 head of roads policy @entity99 said : ‘ our worry is that this will all end in chaos			0
motorists will be very annoyed			0
‘ they may welcome less congestion and queuing , but they wo n’t be happy if a penalty charge notice drops through their letterbox because they forgot to pay the one time they used it			0
’ he said : ‘ we ’ve had lots of calls from members who are very concerned			0
we ’ve had people who want to book ahead now for the first day of operation , but say they ca n’t unless they sign up for the pre-pay system			0
’ @entity75 project manager @entity121 said : ‘ @entity122 will help speed up journeys so it ’s great news for the tens of thousands of drivers who use the crossing every day and for the economy			2

@entity6 crossing over @entity7 will have a ' free flow ' system without barriers

electronic system is similar to that used for the @entity21
