crews have been unable to investigate an object resting 100 - 165ft below the sea which is believed to be the remains of the @entity82 , as officials have warned it could be a week before the plane 's black box recorder can be recovered			1
a specialist black box search team from @entity87 is en route to help with the recovery			1
@entity87 's @entity91 crash investigation agency helps with any air crash involving an @entity82 because the company is based in @entity87			2
@entity10 @entity95 personnel carry suspected debris after it was delivered by helicopter from a recovery mission for missing @entity100 flight @entity2 at the airport in @entity102 , @entity103 @entity10 @entity105 personnel recovered more debris from the plane on january 2 @entity10 @entity109 crew carry the remains of an @entity2 flight @entity2 passenger recovered at sea on january 2 @entity10 @entity109 and police carry a stretcher across the tarmac after a @entity18 cleric had said a prayer over ms @entity28 's body , the casket was immediately taken to a village and lowered into a muddy grave , as @entity124 traditions require bodies to be buried quickly			1
an imam said a simple prayer as about 150 people gathered in the drizzling rain , and red flowers were sprinkled over the mound of wet dirt with a small white tombstone			0
so far 16 bodies have been found from @entity135 out of the 162 passengers and crew that were on board when the plane disappeared from radar			2
the aircraft disappeared on sunday while on route between @entity12 to @entity66 shortly after the pilot radioed to report stormy conditions			2
workers began finding wreckage on tuesday , with 16 bodies pulled from the water near @entity150 , including one wearing a life jacket and two others reported to be holding hands			2
a minesweeper boat and private survey ship have since located a large object beneath the waves which officials believe to be the plane , though no ' pings ' from its black boxes have be detected so far			2
the remains of @entity9 were handed over today ( left ) as rescue workers returned to the sea of @entity10 to search for more bodies			1
so far 16 victims have been recovered ( right ) dive teams have promised an ' all out effort ' to find more bodies today after rough seas and dire weather halted earlier efforts to investigate potential wreckage on the seabed it is the middle of @entity10 's rainy season , so strong winds , heavy rains , and rough seas have so far prevented anyone from descending to inspect the object			1
officials said that divers would not be sent underwater until there was a confirmed target			0
@entity10 air force spokesman rear marshal @entity186 said his men are ' focusing on finding the body of the plane , ' adding : ' there was something like a dark shadow once seen from a plane , but it can not yet be proven as wreckage			1
' @entity197 commander lieutenant @entity195 said the weather was making the operation especially difficult			2
search teams have identified an object resting 100 - 165ft under the sea , which they believe to be the wreckage of the @entity205 , but divers have been unable to inspect it because of dire weather conditions investigators are still not clear what caused the plane to crash , and say that it could be a week before the black box recorder , which contains essential data and recordings from the cockpit , is found the bodies were found floating in the sea near @entity150 , and included an air stewardess dressed in uniform , one person wearing a life jacket , and another pair reported to be holding hands he said : ' what is most difficult is finding the location where the plane fell - checking whether the aircraft is really there			1
' this is very difficult even with sophisticated equipment			0
with weather like this , who knows ? we are still hopeful and optimistic that they 'll find it			0
' it is still unclear what brought the plane down about halfway into its two - hour flight , though investigators are working on a theory that the plane stalled as it climbed steeply to avoid a storm			2
during the pilot 's last radio call he sough permission to climb above rough weather but was denied because of heavy air traffic			2
four minutes later , the plane vanished without issuing a distress call			0
the bodies are being taken to @entity12 ( pictured ) , where the @entity2 flight originally took off , where many of the families have gathered and religious services are being held officials say it is likely that there are scores of bodies still trapped in the wreckage of the plane , but say they have not confirmed where the plane is and will not send divers in until they have a target the cockpit - voice and flight - data recorders , or black boxes , hold data that will help investigators determine the cause of the crash			1
aviation expert @entity272 in @entity273 said there 's a good chance the plane hit the water largely intact , and that many passengers remain inside it			2
he added that bodies recovered so far would have come out with a breach in the fuselage			0
' but most passengers still should have had their seat belts on , particularly as the plane was going into weather			2
the captain would have still had the seat belt sign on			0
' items recovered so far include a life jacket , an emergency exit door , an inflatable slide , children 's shoes , a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food			0
bodies removed from the water are being sent to @entity102 , a town near to @entity150 , before being transported to @entity12 , @entity10 's second - largest city , where @entity298 took off			1
many family members have remained at the @entity12 airport since getting word that the plane disappeared			1
dive teams are on standby to search any wreckage for more bodies , but say it is extremely difficult to identify where exactly on the seabed the plane is , even with sophisticated equipment the crash happened in the midst of @entity10 's rainy season , meaning strong winds , rough seas , and heavy rains are making search efforts especially difficult workers have also recovered several items that they believe are from the plane , including a life jacket , emergency exit door , and emergency slide ( pictured ) other items found adrift in the ocean include children 's shoes , a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food ' help us , @entity21 , to move forward , even though we are surrounded by darkness , ' the rev. @entity330 of @entity331 about 100 relatives gathered in an airport waiting room wednesday			1
about 40 members of @entity330 's church died in the crash			0
' some things do not make sense to us , but @entity21 is bigger than all this			0
our @entity21 is not evil			0
' officials have not announced the identities of the 16 bodies recovered			0
relatives have given blood for dna tests and submitted photos of their loved ones , along with identifying information such as tattoos or birthmarks that could help make the process easier			0
@entity10 is using a minesweeper craft and a private search vessel which have identified a large ' shadow ' on the seabed which investigators believe to be the wreckage while search teams have identified a large object they believe could be the wreckage , they say they have yet to pick up any ' pings ' coming from the black box recorder @entity365 the @entity2 jet which plunged into the @entity368 rose up as fast as a fighter jet and then dropped almost vertically into the sea as if being thrust down by a giant hand , crash experts agreed today			1
their conclusion is that the @entity82 320 - 200 was in the grip of weather so freakishly extreme that there was nothing the pilots could do to save the jet and all 162 people on board			0
the plane behaved in ways ' bordering on the edge of logic , ' @entity10 aviation analyst @entity381 said after examining figures leaked from the official air crash investigation team			1
he said the jet climbed at a speed that would have been impossible for the pilot to have achieved - and then plunged straight down ' like a piece of metal being thrown down			0
' it 's really hard to comprehend … the way it goes down is bordering on the edge of logic			0
' @entity273 aviation expert , @entity397 , from the @entity398 , told the @entity71 that , in contrast , he was baffled by the extremely low speed of the descent - as low as 61 knots - which would suggest the plane was heading almost straight down , explaining why it has been found in water just 10km from its last point of radar contact			0
both experts are in agreement that the jet went down almost vertically - and they also concluded that a freak weather pattern that placed the aircraft under extraordinary forces was to blame for its plight .			0
