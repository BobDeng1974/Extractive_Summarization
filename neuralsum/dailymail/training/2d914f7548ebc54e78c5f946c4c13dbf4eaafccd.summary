@entity0 used to be a 132kg , mother - of - three with a self - esteem that was at rock bottom			1
having battled with her weight since the age of 10 , she 's transformed herself from a size 26 to a size 6 after losing 84kg			1
but it all came at a cost as the 32 - year - old had to tap into her superannuation to pay for two of her surgeries			1
' i 've always been big so i knew nothing else , ' she told @entity28			2
the diet shakes and the diet pills but i always gave up too early			2
exercising was always part of my life but that did n't work either			2
' that life she once knew was taking a toll on her physically and mentally			0
' in one sitting i could consume one to two pizzas and would have at least two litres of coke a day			0
salad was out of my vocabulary , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' on the outside , i was a confident and loud person but behind closed doors i hated myself and my body			0
' but one day she woke up and realised she could no longer live the way she had been for the last 20 years			0
so in 2012 she decided to finally do something for herself			0
' i did n't realise how big i was until i looked at myself in photos , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' i knew this was the time for me to do something for myself because i was embarrassed to be around my husband and my kids			0
' so came the decision to undergo a sleeve gastrectomy , a potentially life - threatening surgery which cost about $ 10,000 in september 2012			1
' it 's a surgery which removes about 85 per cent of the stomach so yes there was a high risk involved , ' she said			1
' i decided to do it because i knew this was it for me and because i did n't have the money i used my superannuation funds to pay for it			2
' but even after going from 135kg to 51kg , ms @entity0 felt unhappy with her significantly reduced reflection			1
' i felt like a man because i went from a @entity70 cup to having no breast tissue and there was a lot of skin to cut away , ' she said			2
@entity0 on her wedding day in 2010 ( left ) and post weight - loss surgery ( right ) @entity0 and her husband @entity77 married in 2010 but renewed their vows in july this year ms @entity0 says she can now stand proud next to her husband and kids so the second phase of ms @entity0 's transformation came when she met plastic surgeon dr @entity84 in 2013			1
' he 's the one who changed me , ' she said			0
that 's when she opted for a tummy tuck , breast implants and lift which cost a total of $ 23,000			1
' after the surgery i was finally been able accept myself , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' but by then i 'd cleared out my superannuation			2
' and it 's a decision that she does n't regret			0
' this has added 20 years to my life , ' she said			0
' i see my reflection now and i think " wow i ca n't believe i look like that "			0
' i feel younger , healthier and happier			0
i can run around with the boys and i can keep up with them			0
' it 's the best feeling and now i can stand proud next to my husband and kids			0
' ms @entity0 says she could n't have done it without the support of her three kids and husband @entity77			1
so become an improved version of herself , ms @entity0 decided to renew her vows in july			1
' i did it because i 've always wanted to look like a princess on my wedding day and that 's exactly how i felt , ' she said .			0
