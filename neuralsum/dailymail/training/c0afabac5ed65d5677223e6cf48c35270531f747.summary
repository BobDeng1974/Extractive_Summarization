by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 i gave @entity3 a standing ovation after he said the most sensible and productive thing any @entity7 player has said for decades			1
' we are too honest , ' our best player said			0
at long last someone gets it , someone who ’s at the centre of @entity7 ’s misery finally understands one of the basics of @entity17 : you wo n’t get anywhere without a little bit of cheating			1
you can all get on your moral high horse and gallop off into the self - righteous distance if you like , but @entity3 is unquestionably correct			0
i ’ll give you two examples that could have – and should have – changed the course of @entity27 football history			0
admission : @entity3 said @entity7 were too honest during their @entity30 disaster exit : @entity7 were eliminated eight days into the tournament and did n't win a game in @entity34 firstly , @entity35 86			1
i notice this week @entity36 has been defending his record of no yellow cards in his career			2
that is a shameful boast			0
@entity7 were 2 - 1 down in the quarter final to @entity43 in 1986 , and late in the game @entity44 sends over a delicious cross to give @entity47 a golden chance to equalise			1
but desperate to protect his no yellow cards boast , he bottled it , and @entity43 cleared			2
@entity47 should have cheated : by that stage of the game every @entity7 player knew @entity54 had scored with his hand , so @entity47 should have cheated too			1
elbow the defender out of the way , or put the ball in with your hand – just do whatever it takes to get that ball over the line and keep @entity7 in the @entity30			1
i ’m not the only one who thinks that			0
i recently interviewed one of the @entity7 squad from 1986 who felt exactly the same way			2
but he would n’t go on record because ' you ca n’t crticise @entity36 , can you ? ' yes i can			2
he should have been prepared to cheat for his country , and exact instant revenge on @entity54			2
clean : @entity36 never received a yellow card during his career at the highest level @entity77 : @entity54 's infamous goal against @entity7 at the @entity79 in 1986 the second example happened in this @entity30 : @entity81 was clearly rushed back from injury to save @entity83			1
so in @entity87 when he took to the field against @entity7 , did none of our players think it would be a good idea to get stuck into him ? do n’t misunderstand what i ’m saying here – i do n’t mean break his legs deliberately or anything so crass			1
no , let ’s be clear – i mean get physical with him , unsettle him , put him off his game			0
@entity3 said that he was kicked 10 times during the @entity83 game and every time the opponent got away with it			0
so why did n’t we do the same to their best player , who was n’t fully fit ? instead our players set up a five - yard exclusion zone around @entity81 that no player in a white shirt could enter			2
the players might as well have sat in the crowd watching him			0
get @entity112 ! kick him off the park if you have to			0
freedom : @entity81 ran @entity7 ragged during their 2 - 1 victory in @entity87 buried : @entity81 scored twice to eliminate @entity7 from the tournament after their second loss @entity120 avoided a yellow card for planting his forearm into @entity124 ’s throat			1
where i used to play football if a ref did that it meant you had a free shot at one of their players			0
so where was the @entity27 elbow in the @entity83 throat ? it never happened			0
i do n’t want to win the @entity139 award thanks , i want to stay in the @entity30			2
look at those who have done well : 2010 – both finalists disgraced the game with 120 minutes of kicking , fouling and diving			0
2006 – @entity145 won the @entity30 but cheated in the round of 16 , @entity144 admitted he dived for a penalty to beat @entity148 in the final moments of the game			1
in 2002 – @entity34 were world champions , but who can forget @entity153 clutching his face to get @entity155 sent off when the @entity156 had clearly kicked the ball at @entity153 ’s leg ? @entity153 even confessed he ’d cheated straight afterwards			1
struck : @entity153 falls to the floor holding his face in 2002 , even though the ball hit his leg tumble : @entity144 dived to win a penalty against @entity148 in 2006 , and @entity145 went on to win the @entity30 the list goes on and so @entity7 face a choice : do we carry on giving every team we play against a head start ? or do we get down and dirty with the rest of them ? @entity7 must start cheating			1
it ’s what winners do			0

@entity7 will not get anywhere without a little bit of cheating
@entity36 should have cheated for @entity7 in the 1986 @entity30 quarter - final against @entity43 , just like @entity54 did
@entity7 should have *roughed* up @entity81 in @entity87 , but instead they gave him the freedom to score twice
@entity153 collapsed to the floor in 2002 holding his face , even though the ball hit his leg
@entity144 dived to win a penalty against @entity148 in 2006 , and @entity145 went on to win the @entity30
