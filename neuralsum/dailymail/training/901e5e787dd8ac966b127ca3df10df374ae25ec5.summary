a new study claims to define what exactly is classed as sexually deviant do you ever worry if what floats your boat sexually might be a little unusual ? or even downright bizarre ? if so , a new study claims to set everything straight - and define the demure from the deviant			1
its conclusion ? men hoping for sex with two women is ' normal ' - for women , the general theme is more @entity16			1
these were just two of the findings of a research project that claims to scientifically define sexual deviation for the first time ever			1
conducted in @entity22 , @entity23 , the research was published today in the @entity24			1
the idea behind the research was that while ' deviant sexual fantasises ' often conjure up images of being very unusual , in a press statement , the authors said : ' many theories about deviant sexual fantasies incorporate the concept of atypical fantasies , or paraphilias			1
' @entity36 is defined as the the experience of intense sexual arousal to atypical objects , situations , or individuals			2
however the authors argue that ' scientific literature does not describe what these types of fantasies actually are '			2
in the @entity47 , the psychiatric bible , the @entity49 ( @entity49 - 5 ) , mentions , ' anomalous ' fantasies			2
even the @entity51 talks about ' unusual ' fantasies in defining paraphilias			0
but , the @entity23 study authors questioned , what is an unusual sexual fantasy exactly ? @entity57 , lead author of the study , said : ' @entity60 , we know what pathological sexual fantasies are			1
' they involve non-consenting partners , they induce pain , or they are absolutely necessary in deriving satisfaction			0
* the nature of sexual fantasies varies among the general population - meaning few can be considered statistically rare , unusual , or typical			1
* men have more fantasies and describe them more vividly than women * between 30 and 60 per cent of women - think of themes associated with submission ( e.g. being tied up )			1
* unlike men , ' women in general clearly distinguish between fantasy and desire ' * the majority of men would love their fantasies to come true * women tend to fantasise about their partner , while men generally fantasise more about extramarital relationships * men are more likely to think about watching their partner being with someone else or being with someone of the same sex themselves ' but apart from that , what exactly are abnormal or atypical fantasies ? ' ' our main objective was to specify norms in sexual fantasies , an essential step in defining pathologies , ' he explained			1
' and as we suspected , there are a lot more common fantasies than atypical fantasies			0
' to find out , they asked members of the general population - ' as simple as that , ' said professor @entity57			0
because most studies of this nature are conducted with university students , the researchers wanted to find adults willing to describe their sexual fantasies			1
for the study , just over 1,500 adults in @entity117 ( a 50/50 split of men and women ) completed a questionnaire describing their sexual fantasies			1
they were also asked to describe their favourite fantasy in detail			0
' the results were more than interesting , ' said professor @entity57			0
' what surprised the researchers was that the nature of sexual fantasies varies among the general population - meaning few can be considered statistically rare , unusual , or typical			1
' but not surprisingly , the study confirms that men have more fantasies and describe them more vividly than women , ' he added			1
the study also found that a significant proportion of women - between 30 and 60 per cent - think of themes associated with submission ( e.g. being tied up )			2
researchers men hoping for sex with two women is ' normal ' - and they were more likely to think about to think about extramarital affairs than their female partner ' importantly , unlike men , women in general clearly distinguish between fantasy and desire , ' professor @entity57 said			1
' therefore , many women who express more extreme fantasies of submission ( e.g. domination by a stranger ) specify that they never want these fantasies to come true			2
' the majority of men , however , would love their fantasies to come true ' , e.g. sex with more than one other person			2
and while women tend to fantasise about their partner , men generally fantasise more about extramarital relationships compared to women			1
swingers on the hunt for excitement are spreading sexually transmitted infections by taking part in drug - fuelled orgies , research claimed earlier this month			0
a @entity174 study found almost half of older swingers admitted taking illegal substances to boost their prowess in the bedroom and keep multiple partners satisfied			0
as well as erectile dysfunction drugs such as @entity189 , they are also using cocaine , ecstasy ( @entity192 ) , @entity193 , laughing gas , cannabis , poppers , speed , lsd and lysergic acid to help them perform - at levels similar to gay men			0
however , their unsafe sexual practices are putting them at increasing risk of chlamydia , gonorrhoea , syphilis , @entity202 and hepatitis b , experts warn			0
the researchers , writing in the journal @entity205 , say swingers should be targeted with the same health advice as other at - risk groups			0
the study also noted : ' one of the most intriguing findings has to do with the significant number of unique male fantasies			2
' by this , it was referring to watching their partner being with someone else , for example , or being with someone of the same sex			0
' evolutionary biological theories can not explain these fantasies , which , among males , are typically desires , ' said professor @entity57			0
' overall , these findings allow us to shed light on certain social phenomena , such as the popularity of the book ' @entity16 ' with women			0
' he and his colleagues are now looking at whether people who like one thing - say , have submission fantasies - also like play the opposite role			0
' these two themes are therefore not exclusive , quite the contrary - they also seem associated with a higher level of satisfaction , ' he explained			0
the study was undertaken by researchers at @entity244 and @entity245 , affiliated with @entity246 .			2

study claims to scientifically define sexual deviation for the first time ever
@entity23 researchers asked 1,500 men and women about their fantasies
men were more likely to fantasise about an *extra-marital* affair
women more likely to fantasise but not want action carried out in real life
