many women say white wine in particular sends them ' crazy ' or makes them irrationally upset there was a time when an evening with friends was synonymous with a nice , chilled bottle of @entity6 ( or four )			1
but as the years have rolled by , that crisp , glass of gooseberry - flavoured nectar has fallen out of favour			0
' no white wine for me - it sends me mental , ' is how it started			1
' nor me , ' said another friend , and on it went			0
in fact , over the last few years , nearly a dozen of my female friends have declared they can no longer drink what used to be our favourite tipple			1
one was almost arrested , another broke her wrist and another very nearly got run over			0
there are countless other tales of tears , tantrums and tube journeys going disastrously wrong			0
but what is it about the drink of choice for so many women that sends them doolally - or ' psychotic ' , as one friend confessed ? is there something in the wine itself or is it the way we consume it that wreaks such havoc ? firstly , different people react to alcohol in very different ways , dr @entity46 , medical adviser to the charity @entity47			1
' women react more quickly to alcohol , ' she explained			1
' if you ’re a sturdy woman , you might think you can drink any scrawny man under the table - but do n’t be fooled			2
' even if a woman is the same size as a man , she will have more body fat and less body water			0
' since alcohol is only distributed in body water , you ’ll have a higher proportion of it in your bloodstream			1
’ this , she says , may be why women tend to suffer from worse hangovers			2
indeed , researchers at the @entity68 - @entity67 found that not only do women get drunk faster , but their hangover symptoms were more severe - even though they drank the same amount as the men			1
then there 's eating on on an empty ( or at least emptier than many a man 's ) stomach , which one study likened to taking alcohol intravenously			1
' drinking alcohol on an empty stomach means the alcohol is absorbed into your system quicker , ' said dr @entity84			2
but what does seem to be key in the white wine situation is the speed at which it is drunk - and the volume of alcohol it contains			1
both dr @entity84 , and dr @entity92 , a gp at the @entity94 and @entity96 's resident doctor , agree that women tend to drink more quickly			1
' @entity99 wine is a female drink - more women drink white wine even than red wine , ' dr @entity92 told @entity105			1
' if a woman orders a large 250ml glass , that 's a third of a bottle of , say , 13 per cent alcohol			1
and she can often drink that a lot quicker than a man drinking a pint ( 568ml ) - which is also weaker in terms of volume of alcohol			1
' whereas a man might take 30 minutes to drink a pint ( which contains on average two units of alcohol ) , some women will drink a glass of wine ( which could be up to three units ) in 10 - 15 minutes , ' he added			1
' the strength of wine has also increased , ' gp @entity92 told @entity127			2
experts advise those who are worried about their consumption - and the effects - to cut down on glass size and the alcohol volume of wine the effects of too much alcohol also manifest themselves in different ways			1
' men tend to get more aggressive as they have more testosterone - but for women , alcohol can be more of a depressant , so they may cry			1
' however things are changing and young women are becoming equally as violent as men , ' he added			2
while there appears to be no published research - or evidence - that white wine per se is the culprit for so many women becoming so intoxicated , theories abound			1
one is that white wine contains more sulphites than red wine			1
while sulphites are naturally found on grapes , small amounts of sulphur are added prior to fermentation as a preservative to keep the freshness and remove unwanted yeasts and bacteria			2
however sulphites have been linked - anecdotally , at least - with ' drinking blues ' and depression , as well as a host of other ailments from allergies to headaches			0
white wine also contains up to 10 times more sugar than red , according to the @entity175			1
a large glass of 13 % wine puts a woman over the government 's lower risk guidelines			2
another small glass ( 125ml ) will put men over the guidelines too			0
wine is often consumed at dinner time alongside a meal but did you know that a large glass of 13 % wine ( 250ml ) can add 228 calories to your evening supper ? this is similar to a @entity195 ice cream or two fish fingers			0
a standard glass of 13 % red or white wine ( 175ml ) could also contain up to 160 calories which is similar to a slice of @entity201			1
often when sharing wine , we assume we ’re drinking less calories but a bottle of wine shared between two could mean you are consuming 340 calories each - that ’s the equivalent of a pain au chocolat pastry each			0
source : @entity47 whereas red contains 0.2g sugar per 100ml , rose contains 2.5g per 100ml			0
meanwhile dry white wine contains 0.6g and medium white wine 3g per 100ml			1
while there is no published evidence to prove a link between higher sugar alcohol and more boisterous behaviour , there is a wealth of research proving sugar can dramatically affect behaviour			1
' the strength of wine has also increased , without a doubt , ' said dr @entity92			0
plus , women in particular are more likely to ' overpour ' , according @entity47 , which warns many of us have no idea how much we 're glugging from the glass			0
for example , a large ( 250ml ) glass of 13 per cent wine puts a woman over the government 's lower risk guidelines for alcohol consumption			1
it also contains up to 228 calories - similar to a @entity195 ice cream or two fish fingers			0
elsewhere , it has been suggested that white wine is simply more ' drinkable ' - i.e. we drink it faster and end up consuming more			1
then there 's the bubbles in drinks such as champagne or prosecco			0
' the carbon dioxide makes the body absorb alcohol more quickly - which in turn makes you drunk more quickly , ' said dr @entity92			1
there is some evidence that bubbly drinks intoxicate you more quickly than flat drinks			0
a study at the @entity268 in 2001 found volunteers given two glasses of fizzy champagne had an average of 0.54 milligrams of alcohol per millilitre of blood after five minutes , while those given the same amount of flat champagne had 0.39 milligrams			0
one theory is the carbon dioxide in bubbles speeds up the flow of alcohol into the intestine			0
indeed , turning your wine into a spritzer may not be the restrained option you think , as the researchers said mixing fizzy water with wine could have a similar effect			0
white wine also contains up to 10 times more sugar than red , according to the @entity175			1
whereas red contains 0.2g sugar per 100ml , rose contains 2.5g per 100ml			0
meanwhile dry white wine contains 0.6g and medium white wine 3g per 100ml the principle could apply to all carbonated drinks , including beer , adds dr @entity301 , a senior lecturer in nutrition at @entity303 and independent adviser to the @entity305			1
although this wo n’t necessarily increase the severity of your hangover , getting drunk faster may impair your judgement more quickly and spur you to drink more , dr @entity84 warns			2
it is also true that some ethnic groups suffer more after drinking because of their genetic make - up			0
‘ we know @entity316 have very low levels of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ( an enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde ) , which can make them get drunk more quickly and contribute to hangovers , ’ says dr @entity84			2
and the next morning ? when it comes to hangovers , most of us are familiar with the phrase ‘ beer before wine and you ’ll feel fine , but wine before beer and you ’ll feel queer			0
’ but why is this ? ' a possibility is that beer has a higher water content than wine , so you ’re getting more fluids into your body if you drink beer , ’ says dr @entity301 , a senior lecturer in nutrition at @entity303 and independent adviser to the @entity305			1
' people tend to drink more at the beginning of a session to quench their thirst , so beer may keep you slightly better hydrated			0
' one large glass of wine can put you over the lower risk guidelines for the day			0
to stay on track , try these tips from dr @entity46 , expert medical advisor to alcohol education charity @entity47 ... 1			0
mind your measures downsize your drinks - if you drink wine opt for a smaller glass			2
there are generally three sizes of wine glass – 125ml , 175ml and 250ml			0
an average 125ml glass of wine would be around 1.5 units , but a 250ml glass could be over 3 units			0
so , just one large glass and you ’ve already drunk the equivalent of the government ’s lower risk guidelines 2			0
tackle your triggers if you always have a glass of wine to celebrate a good day at work , or commiserate a bad one , try doing something else instead			0
an alcohol - free dinner out makes a feel - good treat , while a gym session is a great way to relieve stress			2
give alcohol - free days a go if you drink regularly , your body starts to build up a tolerance to alcohol			2
this is one of the main reasons why many medical experts recommend taking regular days off from drinking to ensure you do n't become addicted to alcohol			1
test out having a break for yourself and see what positive results you notice			0
drink low alcohol or alcohol - free wine			1
the alcohol content in normal wine ranges from 9 to 15 % ; however , lower alcohol and no alcohol wines are readily available – have a look next time you go to the supermarket			2
treat yourself trade up to a special bottle of wine that 's expensive enough to encourage you to saviour it over a few days , rather than down it all in one night			2
this way , you 'll space out the units you 're consuming			0
track your drinking over time if you choose to drink , recording exactly what you 've drunk during the week will give you a great idea of whether you 're within the guidelines			2

many women say they can no longer drink white wine
they complain it makes them upset , aggressive and / or *accident* prone
@entity105 set out to *investigate* possible reasons why
some experts suggest speed at which it 's drunk , others blame alcohol level
other theories include higher levels of sugar and sulphites in white wine
