@entity0 has ordered the recreation of the famous ' pleasure troupe ' of young women that @entity5 leaders have traditionally employed to entertain them			1
@entity0 disbanded the group of hand - picked teenagers shortly after the death of his father in the @entity5 capital @entity11 in december 2011			1
but now that the country 's official three - year mourning period for @entity15 has concluded , the eccentric autocrat has demanded his advisers find suitable new women for the role , as the previous members retired and were married off to military generals when they hit their early 20s			2
here he is mobbed by emotional women during an inspection of an all - female military unit mobbed : @entity0 smiles as he walks alongside members of @entity5 's women 's national soccer team happily married : @entity0 is photographed with his wife @entity32 in @entity11 in july 2012 news that @entity0 is re-establishing the so - called ' pleasure troupe ' was reported by @entity36 's @entity35			1
the tradition was established by the dictator 's grandfather @entity38 - sung - who is considered the founder of @entity5 and still holds the title of eternal president despite dying in 1994			0
@entity5 officials have traditionally scoured the countryside for pretty teenagers , sometimes as young as 13 - years - old , who are then taken to @entity11 to work as dancers , singers or servants for the country 's leaders			1
often the most attractive girls are forcibly married off to powerful military generals as a way of rewarding the men for their all - important loyalty to the regime			0
as part of the handover of power following the death of @entity64 in 2011 , the entire troop was dismantled and sent off to marry members of the @entity5 establishment			0
but now that three years have passed it is thought acceptable for @entity0 to restart the tradition by finding his own girls			0

as teenagers most were simply taken out of school and moved from their hometowns without the consent of their parents , who were no doubt terrified at what could happen to them if they resisted			0
the girls reportedly lived in the senior officials ' houses and were traditionally allowed to marry their employers and ' retire ' from service by the time they reached their early 20s			0
the three - year absence of the ' pleasure troupe ' was due to a complete overhaul of the @entity5 establishment by @entity0 following his father 's death			1
the dictator moved swiftly to remove the most powerful figures from his father 's regime - having many of them executed - and replaced them with his own group of spineless bureaucrats .			2

@entity0 dismantled the group of teenagers after his father 's death
but now three years of mourning has expired he has demanded they return
