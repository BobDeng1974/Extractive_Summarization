a pilot from @entity1 believes he has found the wreckage of the missing @entity3 off the coast of @entity5 after searching thousands of satellite images online			1
@entity7 , 60 , spent hours trawling through the images made available to the public on a crowd - sourcing website , @entity11 , before coming across what he believes is the doomed plane			1
the recreational pilot from @entity15 said he was shocked to discover that the aircraft , which vanished two months ago , appeared to be in one piece beneath the water off the northeast coast of @entity20 , just west of @entity21 in @entity5			1
the image was taken days after the crash			2
he found the image on a website that shares satellite images ' the perfect size ' : he said he used a scale given by the website and compared it to the specifications listed on @entity39 's website - and discovered that the figure in the water was the right size discovery : he said that the lighter markings on the image matched up with the design of the plane he told @entity48 that he used the scale at the bottom of the map on @entity52 and compared them to the specs on @entity39 's website to establish that the white figure he saw was the perfect size			1
' i was taken aback because i could n't believe i would find this , ' he told the news channel			0
where is the plane ? a map shows where @entity7 believes the plane is , compared to its intended flight ( red line ) and suspected flight path ( in blue ) he pointed to the image on his computer as he explained why he thought it was the missing airliner			1
' the lighter skin where the wing attaches to the fuselage - you see that lighter skin , ' he said , comparing the grainy image to a photograph of the make of plane			0
and when @entity48 reporter @entity77 questioned if the shadow could be a shark , @entity7 responded : ' that 's a 210ft shark			0
' @entity52 allows members of the public to go through millions of satellite pictures in a bid to help investigate the crash			2
it also allows other users to rate whether or not they agree with another user 's theory - and so far , no one has disagreed with @entity7 's , he said			0
no one else has noted finding the wreckage at the same spot , he added			0
he said that he started searching for the plane because he wanted to aid the investigation to help the families who had lost loved ones			0
he added that he has contacted the @entity99 and the @entity100 with what he found - but so far they have not contacted him in response			1
this weekend , @entity104 prime minister @entity103 said surface search efforts for the plane have been scaled back because it is ' highly unlikely ' clues will be found on the surface			0
certain : @entity7 said he looked through thousands of satellite images to find the potential wreckage hobby : the recreational pilot , 60 , said that he felt deeply for the families who have lost their loved ones instead , the search will enter a new phase with the focus on the ocean floor - despite there being no ' pings ' from what was earlier hoped were the aircraft 's black boxes			1
mr @entity103 said that as the aircraft , which had 239 people on board , has been missing for 52 days , if there had been any debris from the aircraft it would have now sunk			2
@entity20 's prime minister , mr @entity130 , has also conceded that investigators have made no substantial progress since march 8 - the date that the plane is believed to have crashed			1
' that 's all we have until today , ' mr @entity130 told the @entity138			0
no signs : @entity142 submarine @entity140 concluded its work searching for the black box on friday are they looking in the right place ? a map shows the planned search areas just west of @entity104 no answers : relatives of some of the @entity153 passengers on board the @entity156 flight comfort each other as they continued their sit - in protest outside the @entity20 embassy in @entity160 see below for video			2
