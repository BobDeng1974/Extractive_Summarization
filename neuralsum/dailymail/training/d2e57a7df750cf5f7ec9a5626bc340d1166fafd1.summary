plea : miss @entity0 wants to ' live in peace ' without the intrusion of social workers from @entity6 council , but a court has blocked her from speaking out a frail pensioner of 94 is being barred from speaking to the @entity9 in a draconian ruling by the @entity11			1
the former @entity13 midwife has been gagged after staging a street protest and lodging a petition at @entity16 , complaining about her treatment by social workers			1
she was silenced this week , despite begging the judge at a @entity11 hearing to stop social workers from @entity6 , @entity22 , meddling in her life			1
standing up from her wheelchair , the pensioner , who can be described only as miss g , bravely told mr @entity27 at the hearing in @entity22 : ‘ i am quite capable of speaking for myself			2
i know what i want and what i need			0
i am in my right senses			0
‘ i do n’t what them ( social workers ) to cross my gates or come to my house			1
i want to be left alone by these people			1
’ the controversial gag , which could last her lifetime , flies in the face of demands by the top family court judge sir @entity42 for more openness in the shadowy @entity11 , allowing those appearing there to speak out and complain about their experiences			1
his comments marked a victory for the @entity50 , which has campaigned against secrecy in the family courts			0
miss @entity0 is stopped by a judge ’s ruling at an earlier hearing from naming herself publicly and if she breaches that order or the one that now stops her speaking to the @entity9 , the sanctions include the prospect of a prison sentence or the seizure of her assets			0
the gag on her freedom of speech will last until a psychiatrist , selected by @entity69 , assesses her mental capacity to give press interviews and supplies his evidence at a hearing this summer			0
the hearings involving @entity0 have been brought by social workers who believe her decisions are unduly influenced by her two private carers who came to live at her £ 350,000 house in outer @entity22 two years ago			1
the court has already ruled that @entity81 does not have the mental capacity to decide on her living arrangements and financial affairs			0
@entity6 want her to pay for care from their social workers and hope to remove the couple , known as mrs c and mr f , from her house			1
but before the extraordinary court gag was imposed on wednesday , miss @entity81 told the @entity50 : ‘ i do not want the council people back in my life			1
in the past , when they provided carers from an agency , they did not look after me			2
‘ i was left in a dirty house alone for hours at a time when they cut short their twice - a - day visits			2
‘ they did not shower me often enough and there were foxes in the garden , and insects in my bed			0
‘ when the carers came they put plastic covers over their shoes to protect them because they had left the carpets so filthy			2
it was only when i cancelled the council care plan , which i paid for , that @entity6 began to persecute me and the private carers i chose instead			1
i want to live in peace			0
i know my own mind and i want to be listened to			0
‘ i would like to take legal action for compensation from @entity69			0
i think they failed to look after me properly			0
’ during previous hearings , the court was told that @entity6 social workers , accompanied by police , turned up at @entity81 ’s house 12 times in nine months after @entity125 and mr @entity126 moved in			1
miss @entity81 has complained to the mail of the ‘ frightening ’ visits and the invasion of her privacy			0
and she says her private carers , who come from the same area of the @entity133 as miss g , are ‘ my family and look after me perfectly ’			2
at the beginning of current hearings , she handed a signed statement to the judge begging for the names of herself and @entity69 to be made public			0
it added : ‘ it is my express wish to remain in my own home , with my current 24 - hours carers , and without social services intrusion			1
’ @entity6 – which the court has allowed to be named following a request from the @entity50 – has refused to comment on details of the case .			2

former midwife silenced after saying she did not want social workers
' i want to be left alone by these people , ' she told @entity11
@entity6 council say her decisions are overly influenced by her carers
it wants them removed and *replaced* by its own staff - at her expense
