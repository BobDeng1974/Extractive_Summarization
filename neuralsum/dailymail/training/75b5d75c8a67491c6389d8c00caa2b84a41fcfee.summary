@entity0 believes he still has to improve despite an impressive start to his @entity3 career - and insists @entity2 have the ' quality stars ' needed to challenge for the title			1
the form of the @entity7 forward , signed from @entity8 in the summer for Â£ 32million , has been the one positive in an otherwise inconsistent opening by @entity11 's side			2
@entity0 scored his 12th goal at @entity13 on sunday , when @entity2 again failed to hold onto a lead and were beaten 2 - 1 , having thrown away a 3 - 0 advantage in the @entity17 tie against @entity18			1
@entity0 believes he still has much to improve on despite a successful start to his @entity2 career the @entity7 ( pictured celebrating after scoring against @entity13 ) has been a shining light for the @entity22 in a wide - ranging interview with @entity24 , the 25 - year - old remains upbeat over the decision to leave @entity27 after the @entity28 and that the @entity22 can lift themselves back into contention after the international break			1
' little by little i am gaining confidence in my team - mates and am gradually learning more , ' he said on @entity35			2
' at first i had trouble understanding them , knowing where they ran , their movements , what gestures meant what , but every time i feel more confident			2
' i am starting to memorise the moves of my team - mates and i learn to help them - clearly i need to improve and that is what i say in the dressing room , that i could stay a little less with the ball , play one touch play more often to facilitate counter-attacks , that is vital			1
' i must learn that because the rapid transitions are key in this league and with this team			0
' while @entity0 concedes the @entity3 is ' the most complicated football and not easy ' in comparison with the competitions back home and after subsequent moves to @entity64 with @entity65 and then onto @entity8 , the diminutive forward insists he ' likes the challenge '			1
the @entity7 forward believes @entity2 have plenty of talent to come back to challenge leaders @entity70 and also progress in @entity71			1
@entity0 is still adamant that @entity11 's side can win any competition they enter ' now that i am here , sometimes i stop to look my team - mates during the training session and i realise that i am surrounded by a lot of quality stars , ' he added			1
' i have been impressed by their attitude and their talent			0
' i love how they create spaces , their individual and collective movements			0
' i tell you seriously : i like what i see so much that i have repeated myself many times , that if we have the required winning mentality , if we are positive and try to win every single game , i know we can win any competition			0
' i know that with this team we can win many trophies in the coming years			0
' i hope to win everything here			0
that 's why i came			0
' @entity11 has seen his side struggle to hold onto leads against @entity18 and @entity13 in recent weeks following defeat at @entity13 , @entity2 find themselves in sixth place , four points behind @entity101 and already some 12 off @entity70 , who have yet to lose in their 11 league games			2
like most of their rivals , the majority of the @entity22 ' squad are expected to be in action during the international break , with @entity110 back in the @entity112 fold after his recovery from a long - term knee injury , one of six @entity2 players who could feature at @entity117 against @entity118 on saturday			1
@entity120 striker @entity119 is on course to be closing in on an earlier than expected return from a broken bone in his foot			0
@entity11 will be hoping centre - half @entity125 can be available again following treatment on his troublesome achilles for the visit of @entity130 on november 22 , having been forced to deploy @entity131 at the heart of what has looked a very suspect makeshift defence in recent games .			0

@entity0 has been a shining light for @entity2 this *season*
@entity22 would be 17th in the @entity3 without his goals and assists
but @entity0 remains his *harshest* *critic* and still wants to improve
@entity0 said : ' i could stay a little less with the ball '
