the owners of an @entity2 pizza shop who refused to cater a gay wedding have gone into hiding - but plan to re-open soon after raising $ 500,000			1
@entity5 in @entity6 faced criticism this week after co-owner @entity8 expressed support for a new @entity2 religious objections law			1
despite ' keeping a low profile ' @entity8 and her father @entity11 went on @entity13 on thursday to discuss their comments and and the backlash they 've received			1
it was revealed on thursday that the pizza shop has never catered a wedding before			1
it 's something i never expected or imagined when the comments were made			2
it 's just unimaginable to me , ' said @entity11 when asked about the reaction to his daughter saying she would deny gay couples pizza on their wedding day			1
when asked if they 'll ever re-open their pizza place @entity11 said he initially shut down because he ' could n't tell if they were getting real orders or fake orders ' and said that the phone rang all day and all night			1
' we plan to re-open soon we just do n't know when , ' @entity8 said			1
a contributor from @entity44 's @entity43 set up the fundraising page on @entity46 for the pizzeria , with a goal of helping ' the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front , activists tearing them down , and no customers coming in '			0
controversy : the @entity57 made their comments a week after the @entity59 was passed , forbidding state or local government from ' substantially ' burdening ' a person 's right to their beliefs up in arms : demonstrators gather outside the @entity67 on march 30 in @entity68 to protest the controversial @entity59 a new @entity2 law passed yesterday states that no one has the legal right to ' refuse to offer or provide ' goods , services , facilities or employment to anyone in previously protected classes or based on sexual orientation or gender identity			1
the news comes a little after a week @entity2 passed the @entity59 , which critics say would allow businesses to openly discriminate against gays , and just a few days after his daughter told a local news station they would refuse to serve a gay marriage ceremony			1
speaking to @entity87 on tuesday , @entity8 said : ' if a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding , we would have to say no. ’ according to @entity92 , @entity8 tried to clarify his views , saying he would never refuse to serve gay customers , but as a @entity97 he disagrees with gay marriage , and so would refuse to serve a same - sex wedding			1
the pizza joint has been in operation for nine years			0
the interior of the old - fashioned eatery is adorned with crosses and bible quotes			2
just outside the pizzeria , a signs states that the staff begin each morning with a prayer			0

shuttered : @entity5 in @entity2 , whose owners @entity8 and @entity11 ( pictured ) said they would refuse to cater a gay wedding , closed its doors after being abused over the phone and online ‘ we 're not discriminating against anyone , that 's just our belief and anyone has the right to believe in anything , ’ insisted @entity8			1
when @entity2 governor @entity130 , a @entity131 , signed the controversial @entity59 into law last week , the @entity110 family in @entity6 applauded his decision			1
the measure prohibits state and local government from ‘ substantially burdening ’ the ability of people — including businesses — to follow their religious beliefs			0
@entity130 said in a statement last thursday that the bill ensures ‘ religious liberty is fully protected under @entity2 law			1
’ critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people , but its supporters claimed the bill merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide such things as catering or photography for same - sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds			1
several reviewers invoked @entity162 and the @entity163 in their eviscerating assessments of the pizzeria but they have since been taken down @entity110 , of @entity5 , dismissed discrimination concerns , saying the law is not targeting gays - it merely helps people that have strong religious beliefs			1
she added that as a devout @entity97 , she does not support same - sex marriage – a conviction shared by her father			1
he said : ‘ that lifestyle is something they choose			0
i choose to be heterosexual			0
they choose to be homosexual			0
why should i be beat over the head to go along with something they choose ? ’ the @entity184 and @entity185 pages for the restaurant about 20 miles southwest of @entity187 were bombarded with over 300 mixed reviews and their pizza place has currently just 2.5 stars following the family 's controversial statements			2
a coach of a high school golf program was suspended after a @entity196 post he wrote mentioned going to @entity6 and burning down the restaurant			0
the picture section of the review page has was swamped with images , some of which contain explicit content , supporting homosexuality and gay rights			2
it appears as though those images have since been taken down			0
one five - star review , written from the point of view of ' @entity162			2
@entity211 ' no longer on the page stated : ‘ @entity5 had been recommended to me by my buddy @entity214 years ago - and his praise was well deserved			2
‘ the largely @entity217 ownership manages their subhuman staff quite well			0
no y * * * or q * * * * s to speak of and the tomato sauce was pretty decent for canned			0
’ no longer on yelp : the pizzeria 's @entity185 page was targeted by those who disagreed with the @entity57 ' statements , attracting hundreds of one star reviews , some of which were removed user @entity229 wrote in his review in part : ' you do n't want sinners coming into your business ? guess what ? we are all sinners			2
' the review was accompanied by a meme of @entity8 with a speech bubble that read : ' @entity241 said bigotry is great for sales ! ' many @entity244 mocked ms @entity110 ’s suggestion that anyone would want to order pizza for their wedding reception			1
' as a pizza loving lesbian - i would never serve pizza at my wedding			2
@entity254 , ' fumed @entity255 from @entity256 , @entity257			0
another critic of the @entity6 establishment joked that their discriminatory practices did not go far enough			0
‘ i ’m angry and will never order pizza from these people again because they 're simply not discriminatory enough ! i mean , just " gays " ? what about anyone who works on sundays ( @entity267 23:3 ) ? people who wear makeup ( @entity270 4:30 ) ? hungry people ( @entity272 23:2 ) ? men without beards ( @entity267 19:27 ) ? tattooed people ( @entity267 19:28 ) ? people who eat shellfish ( @entity267 11:10 ) ? people with messy hair ( @entity267 10:6 ) ? new mothers ( @entity267 12:4 - 5 ) ? psychics or mediums ( @entity267 20:27 ) ? ’ a small number of people have come to the @entity286 ' defense amid an avalanche of negative comments			1
@entity289 wrote on the eatery ’s @entity184 page : ‘ @entity292 you for standing up for your rights , its your business and you should run it however you see fit			0
sick of @entity298 denying me of my @entity299 given rights			0
go find another store to shop at or hey open your own store ... ...			0
’ governor @entity130 addressed the backlash against the bill in a @entity307 op - ed piece published monday , writing that he abhors discrimination			0
' if i saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple , i would n’t eat there anymore , ' he said .			2
