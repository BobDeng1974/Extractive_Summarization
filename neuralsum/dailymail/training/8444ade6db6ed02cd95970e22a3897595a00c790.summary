@entity1 's players were treated to a feature of life in @entity4 as a kangaroo hopped past them on their way to training			1
@entity9 's side are preparing to take on @entity4 in sunday 's @entity11 clash , and as they headed down for a training session on the @entity14 the marsupial skipped past them on the path			1
former @entity17 winger @entity16 , meanwhile , believes @entity1 's next opponents are ' there for the taking '			1
the @entity21 skips past @entity1 's players on the path as they headed down for a training session the @entity25 are on the brink of failing to reach the final of a major international tournament for the first time since 1954 following their surprise 30 - 12 defeat by @entity33 in @entity34 and @entity16 says @entity1 will go into sunday 's crunch clash in @entity36 full of confidence following their hard - fought 32 - 26 win over @entity39			1
@entity1 are looking to emulate the @entity17 team of 1992 that beat the @entity41 in the @entity43 capital and @entity16 , who scored the try that wrapped up a 33 - 10 victory at @entity36 's @entity47 , is excited by their prospects			1
' i think if anything @entity1 will go into this game on a higher note than we went into that game , ' said @entity16 , the former @entity56 and @entity57 flier who won 33 caps from 1988 - 94			1
' we had lost the first test and , although we had played well in @entity61 , no one would have predicted that we would have beaten the @entity41 by a record score			0
' that team had some fantastic players in it and it was a great night for @entity67 and @entity68 rugby league , even if i scored the final try from a forward pass from @entity71			2
@entity73 ' @entity72 and @entity75 ' @entity74 wrestle during training ' but @entity9 's team will go into sunday 's game with a bit more confidence i believe			2
i thought they were pretty good against @entity39			0
' @entity9 , who was a player on that 1992 @entity82 tour , is still hoping to have skipper @entity83 back for sunday 's match despite naming a team without him and @entity16 says his availability would add to @entity1 's strength			1
' i was very impressed by the big @entity68 pack on saturday , ' @entity16 said			1
' i thought @entity89 led from the front as he always does and the @entity72 brothers had fantastic games and showed there is life after @entity95			0
' @entity96 has resurrected his @entity98 and international career after things did n't go well for him at @entity100			0
i thought he played well and i thought the two hookers were impressive but it 's probably easy to play well when you 've got such a big pack to lead you around the field			0
@entity1 's players look during a training session at @entity109 , they face @entity4 on sunday ' i also thought @entity110 played like a world - class half - back			1
he got rave reviews from all the @entity41 commentators			0
you would n't think this was a guy making his international debut at the ripe old age of 27			0
' by their own admission , @entity1 will need to improve defensively from their opening game and @entity16 would also like to see more attacking flair from their outside backs			1
' i 'd like to see a bit more of our back three , that 's where we 've been strong in recent years , with the likes of @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , ' @entity16 said			2
' they call @entity129 the world 's best winger but he 's turning into the world 's biggest winger at the moment			2
i would n't like to see him get any bigger than he actually is now			0
if he gets the ball close to the line , he 's going to be pretty hard to stop			0
' @entity89 stretches as he warms up for the training session on @entity4 's @entity14 @entity4 , forced to field five debutants against the @entity140 , will have to make further changes following the injury to half - back @entity143 and @entity16 believes they are under mounting pressure to avoid another defeat			1
' they lost quite handsomely to @entity33 , who played fantastically well , ' he said			0
' admittedly , there were about 11 changes from the team that won the @entity153 so they 're doing it a little bit tough			0
' this @entity41 team are there for the taking			0
i do n't know the last time they last lost back - to - back test matches against different nations but i think the statisticians are saying the last time they failed to appear in a final was back in the fifties so there is a lot of pressure on @entity4			2
' i 'm sure that the press are making them well aware of the fact they need to beat @entity1			2
