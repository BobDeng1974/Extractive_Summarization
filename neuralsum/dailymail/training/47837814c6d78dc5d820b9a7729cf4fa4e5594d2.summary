@entity1 defender @entity0 has been told he is not for sale this summer			1
the 29 - year - old , who is wanted by @entity4 among others , has a year remaining on his current deal and the @entity7 do not want to lose him			1
his representative , @entity8 , told the @entity9 : ' at the moment , there have been some bids coming in			2
@entity1 have rejected those because they think @entity14 is important - everyone 's clear on that			2
wanted man : @entity1 defender @entity0 ( left ) is a summer transfer target for @entity4 on the move ? @entity0 , pictured here in action against @entity22 , has just a year left on his @entity7 contract ' @entity1 are very clear that @entity0 is not for sale			1
whatever offer comes in , he is not going to be sold			0
' that 's the option they 've got and we 're comfortable with that			0
we respect that because he 's their player , he 's under contract			0
' @entity8 admitted @entity1 could cash in on @entity0 now or allow him to leave the @entity32 for nothing in a year 's time , but indicated that an extended stay at the @entity32 is his preferred option			1
he added : ' if @entity0 signs another contract at @entity1 , he will probably end his career there			1
i 'd like to think we can reach an agreement because that is @entity14 's preferred option			0
" @entity4 have registered their interest in @entity0 , to date with little encouragement from his current employers , but @entity8 believes the @entity4 will not allow the matter to rest			1
planning : @entity4 boss @entity46 is hoping to strengthen his defence before the start of next season he said : ' @entity4 have made it clear that they will just keep bidding and bidding			2
they want the player and i understand that			0
' @entity4 are trying to get their business done early , while others prefer to wait			2
it 's too early for a big decision , but the transfer window has only just opened			0
hopefully things will move along in the next week or so			0
