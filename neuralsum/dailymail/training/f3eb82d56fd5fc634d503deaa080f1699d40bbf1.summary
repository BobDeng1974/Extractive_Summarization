at one stage , @entity11 wanted to call @entity3 as a defence witness in court – something which would have caused the prince huge embarrassment because of his role as @entity43 ’s international trade ambassador			1
@entity44 was sold to @entity45 , the son - in - law of the president of @entity23 , for £ 15million in 2007 , despite having been on the market for £ 3million less			0
