he finally went to the doctor after experiencing a number of seemingly unrelated symptoms a fitness fanatic has revealed how a chance remark about his ' croaky voice ' saved his life			1
the comment by a stranger prompted 50 - year - old @entity3 to finally go to his doctor			1
a brain tumour the size of a golf ball was discovered just in time			1
it was only after surgeons operated that he realised he had acted just in time - because the tumour eventually would have killed him			1
mr @entity3 from @entity23 , said : ' it was a worrying time but the operation went well and things have improved massively			1
' i ’m still recuperating and have trouble with my voice if i talk for too long , but when you consider what the alternative could have been i consider myself lucky to be alive			0
' @entity33 runner @entity3 had completed the @entity34 twice and continued to keep himself fit			2
however , six years ago he began losing muscle around his right shoulder			0
he had the problem checked out but no - one could tell him what was wrong			0
@entity3 then began to suffer a string of seemingly unrelated minor problems , such as losing his voice and struggling to swallow			1
he also began losing his balance			0
he said : ' i had been to the summit of @entity45 and @entity46 , but a trip to the @entity48 worried me as i seemed so unsteady on my feet			0
' nothing by itself seemed bad enough to make me worry as it all happened over a period of time			2
' i actually thought old age might be catching up with me			0
' @entity3 decided to go back to his doctor in december after a stranger he met in @entity57 remarked that his voice sounded strange and croaky , confirming his own fears that it had changed			1
@entity3 said : ' i thought my voice had changed - it would tire and start croaking - but my family had n’t noticed			1
i put it down to the air conditioning in the office			0
' this mri scan from 20th december 2011 shows the golf ball sized tumour inside @entity3 's brain this time he wrote down a full list of all his niggling problems , which was enough to worry his doctor			1
@entity3 and his wife before the brain tumor struck			2
he was told he had been just six months from death @entity3 was referred to the @entity75 in @entity76 , where scans revealed a large , non-cancerous tumour inside his skull			1
it was pressing on nerves in @entity3 ’s brain and affecting his speech , balance and ability to swallow			2
days later , surgeons carried out a nine - hour operation to remove the tumour behind his right ear			0
by the time the tumour was diagnosed @entity3 had suffered some nerve damage			1
that means his voice still tires , he has some difficulty swallowing and his balance is still adjusting to the tumour being removed			2
' those are relatively little things , ' said @entity3 , who works as a relationship manager at @entity100 bank			0
' i can still drive a car , go on holiday and live a very normal life			0
i owe my life to mr @entity107 ’s expertise , his team were fantastic			0
' although @entity3 is not going to do any more marathons , he has taken up golf and wants to start running again			2
' i am determined to make the most of this second chance i have been given , ' he said .			0

@entity3 had assumed symptoms such as balance problems were *due* to getting older
thought his voice was different but did **n't** worry as his family had **n't** noticed a change
after stranger noticed his ' croaky ' tone he finally wrote down all his symptoms and went to @entity124
