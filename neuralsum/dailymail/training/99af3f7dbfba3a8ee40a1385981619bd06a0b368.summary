more than 80 state schools in @entity3 have no white @entity5 pupils , @entity1 figures show			1
the number of such schools appears to have more than doubled over the past five years , and the findings will fuel concerns that some parts of the country are becoming increasingly segregated			1
the new figures follow research showing that white @entity5 are retreating from areas dominated by ethnic minorities , to be replaced by immigrants and other ethnic minorities			0
an education : more than 80 state schools have no white @entity5 pupils , compared to 31 schools in 2008 , @entity18 figures have revealed ( file picture ) critics said that the previous @entity1 ’s ‘ open - door ’ immigration policy had created ‘ huge ’ problems for integration , which was now threatening the country ’s social cohesion			1
the @entity18 figures , revealed in a @entity32 request , show that 84 schools recorded last year that no pupils on their rolls were white @entity5			2
of those , 67 are primaries , eight secondaries and the remainder special or pupil referral units			2
the statistics , derived from the annual school census , found that the highest concentration is in @entity44 , with 22 such schools , followed by @entity46 with eight , @entity45 with seven and the @entity48 borough of @entity49 with six			1
other local authority areas in which there are at least two schools with no white @entity5 pupils include @entity54 with @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , as well as the @entity48 boroughs of @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity67			2

@entity103 ’s sir @entity102 said : ‘ this is yet another indication of the huge impact of @entity1 mass migration policies on our society			1
‘ the result of three million immigrants in ten years has created a huge problem for integration of the newcomers			1
obviously , if there are no children of the host community in a school , the prospects of integration are close to zero			0
‘ in the longer term , this is bound to effect the cohesion of our society as a whole			0
’ the new figures follow a study published earlier this month by the left - leaning think tank @entity128 which showed white @entity5 are moving out of areas where they are in a minority at the same time as the ethnic minority population was growing			0
the study said that 45 per cent of ethnic minorities in @entity3 and @entity133 , about four million people , live in areas where less than half the population is white @entity5			0
demos director @entity135 said the number of schools with no white @entity5 pupils was ‘ depressingly high ’ because it suggested there must be many others where the proportion of such pupils was tiny .			2
