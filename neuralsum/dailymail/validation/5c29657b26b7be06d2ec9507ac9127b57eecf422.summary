next stop the masters for @entity1 and let 's hope his final competitive hole before the season 's first major in just over a fortnight 's time proves a portent of things to come			1
taking dead aim with his second shot on the dangerous 18th hole at @entity14 on sunday , the world no 1 judged it beautifully			1
the eight iron approach finished just 6ft from the hole and he rapped home the birdie putt for a 70 for a tied 11th finish in his first appearance at the @entity23 , where @entity25 @entity24 completed a successful title defence			1
given @entity1 climbed to within a stroke of the lead on friday with a run of five birdies in a row during his second round 66 , it hardly represented the summit of his ambitions for the weekend			2
@entity1 finished strongly but had to settle for 11th place at the @entity23 @entity24 ( left ) celebrates winning the @entity23 and is given the trophy by the man himself @entity39 made a successful defence of the trophy at @entity14 on sunday but the tournament was really all about prep work ahead of his attempt to become the first @entity46 to complete the career @entity48 and in those terms , he pronounced himself content			1
' i feel like i got what i wanted out of the week and saw some progress on the things i am working on between now and @entity56 , ' he said			2
' now i 'll go away and work on them some more and hopefully be ready for the masters			0
' that work will be completed at the @entity60 near his home in @entity63 , where the greens will be a lot closer to @entity56 speed than those at @entity14 last week , where he never really looked comfortable			1
as for the masters , @entity1 said : ' i 'm excited with it now so close , and the chance to win a third major in a row and become just the sixth player to complete the career grand slam			1
it is a nice position to be in and i am going to embrace it			0
' @entity1 began seven shots off the lead and threatened briefly to assemble the sort of final round charge that saw him make up just such a deficit to win the @entity84 at @entity85 last year			2
@entity86 threw away a golden opportunity to win @entity89 's tournament @entity90 also had a disappointing weekend as he finished outside the top 20 he birdied the two par fives , the fourth and sixth , and looked certain to birdie the 8th but the putt somehow failed to drop			1
@entity1 bent over in exasperation and at the next his race was run in terms of winning when he ran up an untidy bogey			2
it looked as if the round would fizzle out but he assembled something of a grandstand finish with two birdies in his last three holes			0
alongside @entity1 , @entity46 's other leading hope for a first @entity107 triumph in 16 years must be the @entity108 @entity86 but he will be smarting right now after throwing away a golden opportunity to win @entity89 's tournament			0
after two fourth place finishes in a row in @entity63 , he began the final round with a two stroke lead			0
after losing it on the front nine owing largely to some forceful attacking play from @entity25 @entity116 and @entity24 , he had regained it with four holes to play			0
the only thing that has ever held him back , however , has been his putting and his weakness showed up again with successive three putts at the 15th and 16th holes			0
how costly that proved as @entity24 played a marvellous iron shot to the 18th to set up what proved the clinching birdie			0
@entity86 could not match it to give the unsung @entity128 a one shot win			0
as for @entity90 , the @entity130 's other player in contention at halfway , he will be disappointed with his weekend 's work after a final round 72 left him outside the top 20 .			1

@entity1 finished strongly but had to settle for 11th place
@entity24 defended his title at the @entity23
@entity1 will now turn his attentions to the masters at @entity56
@entity90 finished outside the top 20 at @entity14
