bans on texting and driving may be preventing deadly car accidents in the @entity4 , says a new study			1
researchers from @entity7 found that hospitalizations from car crashes dropped 7 percent between 2003 and 20010 in the 45 states with texting bans when compared to states with no restrictions			1
the research report recently published in the @entity15 could ' not prove ' that a texting ban is what caused the critcal injury drop , though they said it was a likely cause			0
most states : most of the @entity4 has laws that ban drivers from texting while at the wheel to prevent accidents dangerous : drivers between the ages of 25 and 40 are the most likely group of people to get in an accident related to texting and driving @entity33 , @entity32 , @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36 are the only five states in @entity4 that do not have texting at the wheel bans for all drivers			1
@entity40 reports that the study 's leader @entity41 said that while it could not be proven that the lowered rate of hospitalization due to car accidents was caused by texting bans , the restrictions are still linked to a decline in crashes			1
@entity41 said that the greatest benefit was seen in states where texting bans are strictly enforced and where an officer can stop a car just on suspicion the driver breaking the law			1
' some states have secondary enforcement , ' @entity41 explained			0
' in those states , law enforcement has to catch you doing something else first -- like speeding or running a red light -- and then determine that you were texting			2
' the study also found that older drivers were more likely to make a texting and driving mistake than a younger driver			1
' it 's adults , too , ' @entity41 said			0
' they 're constantly checking emails and text messages			0
' @entity74 , executive director of the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) , said that adults between the ages of 25 and 40 were most likely to get in a texting and driving accident			2
slow reaction time : texting at the wheel is dangerous for drivers because it slows down their reaction times the research group found that texting bans caused a 9 per cent drop in car - crash hospitalizations among @entity4 aged 22 and older			1
even though young people benefited from the texting ban , the drop in hospitalizations was not numerically significant			0
there is a lack in data on texting and driving but @entity96 believes that as more studies show more results in favour of the ban , more states will be likely to implement it			2
@entity96 said that drivers should avoid texting while at the wheel at all costs even if they consider themselves to be good multitaskers			2
' it should push those states with weaker laws to strengthen them , ' @entity96 told @entity40			0
research shows that texting at the wheel may be dangerous because it slows reactions more than drink or drugs			0
a study last year found sending a text message delays reaction times by 37 per cent			0
by comparison , using cannabis slows it by 21 per cent , and drinking to the legal limit by 13 per cent			0
the @entity120 found that nine @entity4 are killed every day by doing a distracting activity like texting .			1
