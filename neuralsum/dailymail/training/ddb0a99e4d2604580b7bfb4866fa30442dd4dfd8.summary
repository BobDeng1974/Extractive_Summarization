@entity7 , 36 , was on his way to do his shopping at a hypermarket when his @entity11 developed a fault close to his home in @entity14 , near @entity15 , in northern @entity16			1
the vehicle , which was specially adapted for disabled drivers , started to accelerate as mr @entity7 drove along a dual carriageway with a speed limit of 60mph			1
@entity22 ride : @entity7 , 36 , was on his way to the supermarket when the accelerator of his @entity11 jammed and he could n't slow down desperation : as the car reached its top speed mr @entity7 called the police , who put him through to a @entity11 engineer who tried to guide him to a stop step on the brake pedal with both feet using firm and steady pressure			1
do not pump the brake pedal as it will deplete the vacuum utilized for the power brake assist			0
shift the transmission gear selector to the @entity39 ( @entity40 ) position and use the brakes to make a controlled stop at the side of the road and turn off the engine			0
if unable to put the vehicle in @entity39 , turn the engine off			0
this will not cause loss of steering or braking control , but the power assist to these systems will be lost			0
if the vehicle is equipped with an engine start / stop button , push the button for at least three seconds to turn off the engine			0
if the vehicle is equipped with a key - ignition , turn it to the @entity61 position to turn off the engine			0
do not remove the key from the ignition as this will lock the steering wheel			0
without any pressure on the accelerator at all , the @entity11 started to increase in speed , and mr @entity7 could do nothing about it			2
soon the car had reached its top speed of 125mph and mr @entity7 became to suffer health problems during saturday ’s night ordeal			1
‘ i just wanted it to stop , ’ he said , explaining how he called the police , who put him through to a @entity11 engineer who tried to guide him to a stop			2
as he swerved in and out of traffic , and through three toll booths , mr @entity7 was joined by high - speed police cars which created a ‘ safety ’ convoy			1
the trail of cars sped across northern @entity88 for some 150 miles , eventually crossing the border from @entity16 into @entity90			0
miraculously , they avoided a serious accident before mr @entity7 ’s car ran out of petrol and plunged into a ditch in @entity96 , @entity90			2
