@entity0 is yet to apologise for his bite on @entity2 – but if one does arrive then expect it to include justification for his actions			1
for the @entity8 – twice guilty of sinking his teeth into an opponent – is yet to master the art of a sincere sorry			2
in 2010 , following his bite on @entity13 's @entity12 while playing for @entity14 in the @entity15 – for which he received a seven - game ban - @entity0 ’s apology attempted to explain the indiscretion			1
three years later and in the wake of his attack on @entity48 ’s @entity47 , the @entity44 striker questioned the length of the 10 - game ban served upon him			1
‘ i would like to explain to everybody that i decided to accept the ban because – while 10 games is clearly greater than those bans given in past cases where players have actually been seriously injured – i acknowledge that my actions were not acceptable on the football pitch , ’ he said in a statement			1
controversy : @entity0 ( top left ) is captured biting @entity48 defender @entity47 in april 2013 @entity62 : @entity0 's deliberate handball versus @entity64 at the @entity65 helped @entity25 reach the semi-final confrontation : @entity0 was found guilty of racially abusing @entity67 in 2011 @entity68 hands @entity44 problem in 2011 , @entity0 received an eight - game suspension and was fined £ 40,000 for racially abusing @entity71 ’s @entity67 having called him a ‘ negro ’ during a match at @entity74			1
again , though , his apology was far from contrite			2
‘ i admitted to the commission that i said a word in @entity78 once , and only once , ’ he explained			2
‘ i never , ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then i want to apologise for that			0
’ he was also forced to issue an apology when he refused to shake hands with @entity67 in the corresponding fixture at @entity86			0
meanwhile , at the @entity65 when he was red carded for handling on the line to deny @entity64 a winning goal , @entity0 later admitted he would do the same again after @entity25 went on to win the quarter - final tie			1
and @entity0 ’s latest reaction is to play down the incident with @entity26 defender @entity2 , which occurred during the closing stages of @entity25 's 1 - 0 victory on tuesday , a win which sends them into the second round			1
the 27 - year - old said : ‘ these situations happen on the field			1
' i had contact with his shoulder , nothing more , things like that happen all the time			2
’ @entity27 have confirmed they have opened disciplinary proceedings against @entity0 and the player and @entity25 have until 9pm on wednesday to provide evidence			1
if @entity0 is found guilty of biting @entity2 , however , then expect his apology to be delivered through gritted teeth			1
following his bite on @entity13 's @entity12 in 2010 ... ‘ i feel very sorry about what happened to me against @entity13			1
‘ i apologise to @entity114 and to all @entity14 supporters			0
‘ being the captain , i am aware i did n’t make the right decision			0
‘ i did something wrong			0
in those moments you can only feel your heart beating strong , you are not able to think about what you are going to do and after you just feel bad and regret			0
‘ i am very self - critical and i do know i ’m not like that			2
’ following the ruling that he had racially abused @entity67 in 2011 ... ‘ i admitted to the commission that i said a word ( negro ) in @entity78 once , and only once			0
‘ i never , ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then i want to apologise for that			0
‘ i told the panel members that i will not use it again on a football pitch in @entity136			0
’ following his refusal to shake hands with @entity67 in 2012 ... ' i have spoken with the manager ( @entity140 ) since the game at @entity86 and i realise i got things wrong			0
' i have not only let ( @entity140 ) down but also the club and what it stands for and i 'm sorry			0
i made a mistake and i regret what happened			0
' i should have shaken @entity67 's hand before the game and i want to apologise for my actions			2
i would like to put this whole issue behind me and concentrate on playing football			0
' following his bite on @entity48 's @entity47 in 2013 ... ‘ i am truly very sorry about the incident with @entity47			1
‘ i hope that all the people who i offended at @entity74 last sunday will grant me forgiveness and i again repeat my apology to @entity47			1
i would like to explain to everybody that i decided to accept the ban because – while 10 games is clearly greater than those bans given in past cases where players have actually been seriously injured – i acknowledge that my actions were not acceptable on the football pitch			2
‘ so i do not want to give the wrong impression to people by making an appeal			0
