it looks like something straight out of a @entity3 movie , and on april 1st , most cynics may assume the @entity5 is a poorly considered joke			0
but the 355 - foot scientific platform is genuine and has been used by the @entity9 @entity8 for more than 50 years			1
the @entity10 does not have its own engine and has to be towed to the location of scientific study , where it turns 90 degrees , leaving just 50 feet above the surface			1
the reason behind the flip , is that with 300 feet below the surface , the vessel becomes incredibly stable			1
instead of bobbing up and down on the waves like a traditional boat , it keeps its position			0
it can be also used for oceanography , meteorology and marine mammal observation			0
the vessel can accommodate five crew and up to eleven researchers for up to 30 days			2
once the vessel is towed to its location it ' flips ' within 20 minutes by pumping water into several ballast tanks , sinking the front section of the vessel under the waves			1
after the vessel completes its flip , areas which were previously bulkheads become floors , and the floor becomes a bulkhead			2
in the bathroom , there are two sinks at right angles to each other so the crew can wash their hand no matter which way the vessel is pointed			0
the vessel was launched in 1962 when its unique ability to measure sound underwater would have been vitally important for the development of submarines during the cold war			2
in recent years , it has been far more concerned with studying marine life far below the surface			0
in 2010 , the vessel was deployed to research wind and swell conditions to help improve weather models			0
inside the bathrooms the designers have installed sinks which are at 90 degrees to each other to cope with the flip process the designers initially considered converting a submarine for this unusual mission but soon decided starting from scratch was better the vessel is more than 355 feet long and has been specially designed to cope with the stress of tipping over by 90 degrees operators flood the ballast tanks to turn the vessel on its tail and then pump out the water using air to re-float it			1

the @entity10 looks like it might be an @entity108 , but it as been working hard for more than 50 years
the 355 - foot vessel can flip 90 degrees in 20 minutes allowing researchers a unique *opportunity* to study the ocean
the vessel does not have its own form or *propulsion* and *relies* on tugs to tow it to the area of study
the @entity10 was *commissioned* in 1962 and can sit still in heavy seas with more than 300 feet beneath the waves
