mother - of - two @entity0 survived after spending four days in intensive care with blood poisoning , pictured with her son @entity3 patients ’ lives are at risk from blood poisoning because hospitals are not implementing a standard treatment that can double their chances of survival , experts have warned			1
@entity13 , previously known as septicaemia , affects more than 100,000 @entity15 a year and kills 37,000 – more than breast , bowel and prostate cancer combined			1
now a snapshot @entity20 study reveals that on one surgical ward at a leading teaching hospital , 90 per cent of patients failed to get the correct treatment , involving a simple set of lifesaving measures known as @entity28			1
after high - profile campaigns in 2013 which exposed the shocking death rates , the method was officially recommended by @entity33			0
yet an audit , revealed at the annual president ’s meeting of the @entity37 in march , showed that vital steps in the process are being missed , meaning the condition was more likely to take hold with fatal consequences			0
the college is now calling for nationwide tracking of the protocol to weed out hospitals that are failing to tackle the problem			2
@entity28 involves blood tests to check for infection ; testing the level of lactate , a chemical produced when cells are starved of oxygen ; giving oxygen and iv fluids to protect organs and raise dangerously low blood pressure ; checking urine hourly to monitor fluid levels and kidney function ; and administering antibiotics to clear any underlying infection			1
the study of 23 patients with sepsis at @entity66 revealed just one in ten had their lactate levels tested			1
only 40 per cent were given oxygen , and staff failed to measure urine output in nearly a third of cases			2
dr @entity72 , chief executive of the @entity73 who helped devise @entity28 , warns that , despite being a small sample , the finding of the study was far from unusual			1
‘ sadly this and other studies show patients are not getting access to a treatment that saves lives			1
every one of the six steps is vitally important , and nothing should be missed out			0
’ some 90 per cent of patients were not given correct treatment to prevent blood poisoning on a surgical ward at @entity66 , an @entity20 study revealed sepsis occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection , causing multiple organ failure if not treated quickly			1
it can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body , most commonly the lungs , urinary tract , abdomen and pelvis			2
it is often a problem that develops while in hospital , after surgery			0
those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or cancer are at increased risk			0
symptoms include slurred speech , muscle pain , mottled or discoloured skin , poor urine output and severe breathlessness			2
‘ delays in the identification and treatment of sepsis can have serious consequences for patients , ’ says dr @entity119 , who carried out the @entity66 audit			1
his research also found @entity28 awareness improved after a three - month staff training and a poster campaign			1
more than half of subsequent patients had their lactate measured , 60 per cent were given oxygen and 90 per cent had their urine measured			1
mother - of - two @entity0 knows only too well the importance of staff awareness			0
four days after @entity0 developed a sore throat , aches and pains and a high temperature , she was hallucinating , had a mottled rash and was struggling to breathe			0
‘ my parents carried me to the doctor ’s and insisted my gp call an ambulance , ’ says @entity0			0
‘ at @entity149 i waited four hours in a side room			0
although i had typical symptoms of sepsis , none of the doctors recognised i was dying			2
’ the 26 - year - old from @entity156 says she was just hours from death when a quick - thinking doctor spotted the danger signs			2
@entity0 spent four days in intensive care on oxygen and antibiotics after her liver , kidneys and pancreas all failed			0
‘ i later learned that without treatment , i would have died in my sleep that night , ’ @entity0 adds			0
‘ awareness needs to be raised of this awful condition , which takes so many lives			0
