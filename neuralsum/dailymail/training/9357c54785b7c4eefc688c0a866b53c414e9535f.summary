in a galaxy far , far away he was one of the most feared crime bosses in the universe , with a particular distaste for plucky hero @entity5			0
but now the infamous @entity6 has appeared in our own galaxy - at least , in an animation showing weather patterns on @entity11			1
in the map , the face of the criminal overlord can be made out , with vortices representing his eyes and wind creating scaly , green skin			2
scroll down to use the interactive animation @entity22 - based software engineer @entity21 has created a weather map ( shown ) that looks like the infamous @entity25 character @entity6			1
the animation shows wind speeds and weather patterns around the world			1
in the image @entity6 's ' eyes ' are represented by two vortices the familiar pattern arose in an animated map showing global weather conditions called earth.nullschool.net			1
created by @entity22 - based software engineer @entity21 , the image garnered considerable attention on social media networks when observers noted the similarity to the @entity25 character			1
he said the wind map was a personal project used to learn how to develop web visualisations			0
‘ i originally found the image while playing around with the site , which i then posted on the site 's facebook page , ’ mr @entity21 , 39 , told @entity43			1
according to meteorologist @entity48 from @entity49 , the eyes represent ‘ stationary vortices that are common during the winter months			0
’ the mouth is the ‘ intertropical convergence zone ’ ( @entity53 ) , which is an area that circles @entity11 near the equator where northeast and southeast trade winds come together			1
the pink eyebrows are high - speed winds moving more than 155mph ( 250km/h ) in the upper atmosphere , while the other green lines show the motion of wind elsewhere in the world			2
light green shows the lowest intensity winds , moving up to red and then pink			0
‘ the combination of high altitude winds , colours , and equirectangular projection caused this humourous face to appear , and i could n't stop laughing			1
he noted that he thought it looked ' more like @entity73 ' than @entity6 , but the resemblance to both characters is uncanny			0
‘ of course , it 's 100 per cent an artefact of the site 's calculations , ' he added			0
' the website shows global wind data over a number of different altitudes , updated every three hours , from data made available by the @entity84			0
' ' this particular image shows wind velocity at a pressure level of 10 hectopascals , which is roughly 26.5km [ 16/5 miles ] up , as forecast by the @entity90 @entity89 on 19 january at 12.00 utc			2
' the colors vary with wind speed , as does the motion of the particles , which get faster as the wind speeds up			2
note the projection introduces distortion , too			0
' mr @entity21 told @entity43 that he thought the animation looked ' more like @entity73 ' ( shown right ) than @entity6 ( left ) , but the resemblance to both characters is uncanny @entity101 is the interactive animation that looks like @entity6 , which you can scroll and zoom to view wind speeds and weather effects in different parts of the globe according to meteorologist @entity48 from @entity49 , the eyes represent ‘ stationary vortices that are common during the winter months			1

of course , this map is n’t designed to replicate faces of famous movie character in weather patterns on @entity11			1
it ’s actually a visualisation of global weather conditions that have been forecast by supercomputers			0
the weather is updated every three hours , while ocean surface currents are updated every five days			0
it uses data from the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) , @entity138 ( @entity138 ) , the @entity84 and the @entity84 ( @entity84 )			0
‘ i originally found the image while playing around with the site , which i then posted on the site 's facebook page , ’ mr @entity21 , 39 , told @entity43			1
here @entity6 is seen in a scene from @entity25 : return of the @entity144			2
