he was released today a former @entity6 businessman whose arson - murder conviction was overturned in the death of his daughter was freed from prison earlier today after 24 years behind bars , following a judge 's ruling that the case against him had been based on now - debunked arson science			1
@entity2 , 79 , was released from the maximum - security state prison at @entity17 , @entity18 , and was en route to a federal court hearing to determine the conditions of his release			1
' it is great news for everybody , ' said @entity26 , a longtime supporter who went with a pastor to pick him up and take him to court , under arrangements approved by a federal magistrate			0
several dozen friends , family members and supporters were expected to greet him at the federal courthouse in @entity36 , the state capital			0
district judge @entity38 threw out mr @entity2 's state conviction and sentence of life without parole earlier this month and gave prosecutors 120 days to decide whether they want to retry him in the 1989 death of his daughter , 20 - year - old @entity45			1
prosecutors have said they probably will appeal judge @entity38 's decision			2
they have conceded the arson science used to convict mr @entity2 was faulty but insist that other evidence points to his guilt			2
though he 's spent nearly a third of his life behind bars , mr @entity2 — a native of @entity52 who became a @entity54 citizen about 30 years ago — has never expressed any bitterness toward his adopted country , his lawyer said yesterday			1

that review , completed in june by a magistrate judge , concluded that ' much of what was presented to @entity2 's jury as science is now conceded to be little more than superstition '			0
at the time of his trial , investigators were taught that unusually hot and intense fires indicated the use of an accelerant and that arson could be confirmed by the presence of deep charring or shiny blistering of wood as well as ' crazed glass ' , tiny fractures in windows			0
research has since debunked these and other notions about arson			0
@entity2 , 79 , was released from the maximum - security state prison at @entity17 , @entity18 ( above ) mr @entity2 's case is one of dozens around the country to come under scrutiny because of outdated beliefs about how arson can be detected			1
