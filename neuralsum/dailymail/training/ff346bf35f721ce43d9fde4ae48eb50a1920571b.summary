@entity8 , of course , are not peering at us through double - glazing - instead , the glass sand that covers @entity2 is evidence of lava interacting with ice or water , an ideal recipe for the creation of life			1
one of the most popular theories of how life on @entity20 formed is that undersea volcanic vents created a chemical ' soup ' where the first life forms evolved			0
volcanic glass on @entity2 : @entity8 , of course , are not peering at us through double - glazing - instead , the glass sand that covers @entity2 is evidence of lava interacting with ice or water , an ideal recipe for the creation of life looking in the wrong place ? an image of the @entity39 1 @entity2 lander which touched down on the @entity2 in 1976 and took soil samples and pictures of the surface @entity2 is covered in volcanic glass - direct evidence that water and hot magma once interacted on the @entity2			1
' the glass is most likely volcanic glass produced during explosive eruptions , and potential sources include volcano - ice interactions in the northern lowlands , ' say researchers @entity52 and @entity54 of @entity55			2
' the glass deposits also exhibit signs of weathering , indicating widespread interactions with liquid water			0
' ' these interactions that could create the perfect environments for microbial life , ' says @entity64 , which reported the research			0
' under the hyper - arid climatic conditions @entity2 has experienced over the past three billion years or more , the most likely source of this water is melting ice or snow , ' says @entity52			0
' these results suggest that explosive volcanism may be a major source of sediments on @entity2 , and that limited liquid water has been present at the surface of @entity2 even under long - term hyper - arid conditions			2
' the glass on the surface could be a sign of water beneath the surface - or of long - preserved signatures of vanished life forms			2
many areas of @entity2 show evidence of past water : the enormous 48 - mile long crater that is also one mile deep displays evidence at its edges of channels that could have been created by water displaced by the meteor impact the @entity96 's @entity95 orbiter revealed that up to four million square miles of volcanic glass cover the surface of the @entity2 ‘ we definitely know searching for organisms in the northern lowlands is difficult , ’ @entity52 said			1
‘ i think the better place to go would be those source regions , the ice - magma interactions			0

four million square miles of volcanic glass detected on @entity2 surface
evidence of lava interacting with water
volcanic glass could be ' best place ' to look for life on planet
