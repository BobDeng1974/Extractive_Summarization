with all the time president @entity1 spends on the golf course , you 'd assume he 'd be pretty well practiced by now			1
but according to @entity3 , the commander - in - chief still has a long way to go			0
when asked about who he would want to play golf with , the basketball legend mentioned @entity1 but quickly changed his mind , calling him a ' hack ' and a 's * * * ty golfer '			1
he made the remarks during an interview for @entity13 with sportscaster and former @entity16 star @entity15 , who asked him who he would pick for his ' foursome ' in a round of golf			2
not a fan : in an interview for @entity13 , basketball legend @entity3 said he would n't want to play golf with president @entity1 because he 's a ' hack ' and a game with him would take too long @entity24 : sportscaster and former @entity16 star @entity15 asked him if he was sure he wanted to say that @entity28 , 51 , said he would choose golfing legend @entity29 , and he then named @entity1			1
' i 've never played with @entity1 , but i would , ' he said , before promptly changing his mind			2
' but no - that 's ok - i 'd take him out			2
i 'd be there all day playing with him			1
' ' do you really want to say that ? ' @entity15 asked , looking at the camera , bemused			0
' he 's the @entity38 - he 's a hack ? ' @entity3 added : ' i never said he was n't a great politician			2
i 'm just saying he 's a s * * * ty golfer			0
' the light - humored spat meant that @entity3 never got around to naming his foursome - although he did have enough time to tell @entity15 that he would n't be among the final four either			0
not up to par : president @entity1 , left , who has played 200 rounds of golf since being in office , has a handicap of around 18 , while @entity3 , pictured right , has an impressive 3 handicap @entity3 is a pretty nifty golfer himself and has a 3 handicap , according @entity55			1
@entity1 by comparison ' strives ' for a handicap of 18 , @entity58 , who tracks presidential golfing habits , recently told @entity60			0
the president played his 200th round of golf while in office earlier this month - a staggering number considering @entity66 has played around 270 games in that time			1
former @entity69 mayor @entity68 , former president @entity70 and @entity71 house speaker @entity71 have all teed off with @entity1 at some point			2
in fact , @entity1 has spent more time golfing than he has spent listening to daily intelligence briefings , according to calculations by the @entity77			0
@entity78 off : @entity1 has spent more time golfing than he has spent listening to daily intelligence briefings they estimated he had spent around 700 hours at the briefings compared to 800 hours on 200 golf trips , considering the trips typically last four - and - a - half hours , although one lasted six			1
but even though his obsession has been the butt of @entity87 jokes , he 's far from reaching the presidential record			0
according to @entity92 's book , @entity90 , @entity89 was estimated to have played 1,200 rounds of golf in office , but it could have been as high as 1,600			1
@entity97 is the runner - up at 800			0
he even set up a green outside the @entity100 and visited @entity101 so often that he got his own cabin on the club 's grounds .			0

basketball legend said in an interview he would like to play golf with the president - before quickly *backtracking* and calling him a ' hack '
