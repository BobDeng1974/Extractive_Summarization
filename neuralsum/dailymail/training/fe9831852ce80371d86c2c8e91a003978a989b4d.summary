in the @entity1 , the margins remain very fine			2
here , @entity2 were not at their best but they won			1
@entity5 , on the other hand , began what may yet be a testing season competitively and earnestly but could not find way to bring a save from @entity2 goalkeeper @entity9			1
@entity2 's two goals were easy on the eye even if they were not generally in keeping with a performance that was more reliant on muscle than magic			1
subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			2

goals : @entity20 39 , @entity29 90 booked : @entity20 , @entity53 , @entity68 , @entity52 , @entity56 man of the match : @entity52 referee : @entity72 they were good enough , though , and that is the point			1
many have tipped @entity77 to edge @entity15 's team to the title			2
certainly the @entity81 club will be stronger this season			0
nevertheless , @entity15 would appear to have bought astutely this summer leaving @entity2 stronger in two key positions , at the heart of their midfield and their defence			1
on sunday they settled an interesting contest only in the second minute of added time and that period of play perhaps summed up the difference between the teams on this occasion			0
city looked rather short of complete fitness as the game wore on – something that @entity15 alluded to later – and were under some pressure in the closing stages			0
when the lively @entity5 midfielder @entity43 provided an opportunity for @entity42 in the 90th minute , however , his team - mate could only direct a rather wild shot over the crossbar from 18 yards			1
a goal then and @entity5 would have had a point they probably deserved			1
as it was , @entity2 broke on @entity111 's team quickly and when the impressive debutant @entity56 played @entity29 in down the left , the substitute brought a parry from @entity33 with his first shot and controlled the rebound well enough to find the far corner			1
arguably , that chance was tougher than @entity42 's but it fell to one of the best goal scorers in the world and that , for managers trying to solve problems like @entity111 , is the frustration			2
up front for @entity5 was one of four starting debutants , the @entity128 @entity44			1
the 24 - year - old ran hard and was game enough but looked limited			0
@entity2 , on the other hand , benefited from the expertise of @entity61 – due to sign a new contract this week – and the gentle improvement of the gifted @entity59			1
on occasions like this , it makes the difference			0
' they have world class players everywhere , ' said @entity111 afterwards			0
' at times they make it look like the world has stopped			0
' early chance : @entity61 connects with the ball in an attempt to give @entity2 the lead keeping it all square : @entity61 ( no 10 ) is foiled by @entity33 in the opening few minutes as @entity151 hand off : @entity57 ( left ) and @entity37 duel for the ball in the opening exchanges earning his stripes : @entity5 midfielder @entity41 - who arrived in the summer from @entity156 - challenges @entity2 's @entity68 crash , bang , wallop : @entity36 and @entity61 collide during a keenly - contested first half holding him back : @entity35 ( right ) tries to get a tackle in on @entity59 ( centre ) going ... @entity53 can not stop his momentum following a challenge with @entity44 taking a tumble : @entity53 goes over the advertising hoarding but he was ok to continue new boy in @entity167 : @entity5 striker @entity44 is put under pressure by @entity55 getting used to new surroundings : another @entity5 debutant , @entity43 ( right ) , attempts to beat @entity51 certainly @entity2 produced an opening goal in the 39th minute that turned the @entity5 defence to stone			1
prior to that the champions had played efficient football and @entity33 had saved competently from @entity61 in the third minute and from @entity57 's half volley soon after			1
in 23 season since the @entity1 started , the title - holders have never lost and opening game - there have been 20 wins and three draws			0
the @entity183 goalkeeper had little chance just before half - time , though			0
@entity55 's long pass found the @entity5 defence fractionally light on concentration but @entity61 's first time back heel in to the path of @entity20 was testimony to perfect vision and technique and @entity2 's @entity194 found the corner comfortably			1
up until this point , @entity5 had struggled to trouble city			1
@entity199 players @entity200 and @entity41 were enjoying decent games and @entity43 – another @entity128 – was already in to his stride , scampering across the dimensions of the field imaginatively			0
@entity5 could n't find anything approaching a final pass , though , and as half - time arrived it already looked a long way back			1
@entity2 's intensity soon dropped , however			1
physically , they were not the same team after the interval and @entity5 sough to profit			2
no stopping him : @entity20 goes clear of the @entity5 defence to slot home the opener for @entity2 business as usual : silva wheels away in celebration following his strike touch of class : @entity61 set up @entity20 's goal with a superb backheel , which caught out the @entity5 defence shock value : @entity35 and @entity36 were helpless to stop @entity61 's backheel reaching @entity20 @entity61 's backheel set up @entity20 for @entity2 's opener ... click here for more from our @entity228 compatriots : @entity57 ( centre ) tries to get the better of fellow @entity128 @entity42 getting in amongst them : @entity41 snaps around @entity20 's heels as the ball runs free mins @entity235 @entity5 total 119.5 74.3 @entity41 90 12.3 7.7 @entity34 90 11.9 7.4 @entity43 90 11.9 7.4 @entity2 total 113.8 70.7 @entity55 90 11.5 7.1 @entity20 90 11.5 7.1 @entity56 90 11.5 7.1 data courtesy of the @entity237 , the @entity238 of the @entity1 as time passed , the home team certainly began to push @entity2 back			1
@entity43 's influence increased and @entity15 's team began to look for full - time if not desperately then certainly enthusiastically			2
@entity243 dallied over one chance from a corner before young left - back @entity37 beat @entity9 to another cross only to head over the bar from seven yards			2
it was at the death , though , that @entity2 's defensive resolution was really tested and substitute @entity45 looked certain to equalise after turning beautifully inside two defenders only for @entity56 to apply a crucial defensive touch and divert the shot wide			1
@entity111 called it an ' unbelievable tackle ' and he was n't wrong			0
@entity15 , meanwhile , was happy to head in to next monday 's game at home to @entity258 with points already in the bag			2
' i thought we played very well , especially in the first half , ' said the city manager			0
' in the second half , we did not have so much possession of our ball because seven of our ten outfield players were not really fit enough to last 90 minutes at the same pace			0
' we only need to have the same attitude as we showed today and the same hunger for glory that we have started the season with to have a chance			0
' i am sure this squad can fight for the title again			0
' only a fool would argue			0
beaten to the punch : @entity9 ( centre ) gets nowhere near the ball as @entity37 ( second left ) heads over foot up : @entity59 takes control of the ball as @entity36 ( left ) tries to close him down where 's the ball gone ? @entity51 ( right ) seems disorientated following an aerial challenge with @entity44 ( left ) getting a bit of shut eye : @entity2 's new midfielder @entity56 goes up for a header with @entity42 putting his body on the line : @entity35 throws himself at the ball to block @entity59 's shot sealed the win : @entity29 doubled @entity2 's lead in added time to give the result a touch of gloss tribute : @entity36 ( centre ) lays wreaths and greets family members of @entity5 fans @entity302 and @entity303 , killed on @entity304 poignant : a banner from @entity2 supporters dedicated to the two @entity5 fans who died on @entity308 an impeccable and touching tribute was paid to the two @entity5 fans killed in the @entity304 air disaster			1
@entity303 and @entity302 , who were on their way to watch their team in @entity315 , were remembered with a minute 's silence , while captains @entity36 and @entity52 laid wreaths on the pitch and stood alongside family members during the tribute			1
supporters then applauded for the duration of the 17th minute			0
it was only last season that @entity111 hurled an expletive - laden insult at @entity15			0
' * * * * ing old * * * * ' was his charming remark			0
this time , however , the pair shared a friendly handshake , kept their distance during the game and @entity111 even invited @entity15 for a glass of wine afterwards			0
perhaps the best - timed run of the day came from a pitch invader who waited until the chaos of full - time before entering the field and making for @entity29			2
the @entity2 fan then enjoyed a 30 - second conversation with his hero before security intervened			2
but whatever he said must have worked , for @entity29 led the fan to the away dug - out where he was rewarded for his endeavour with a piece of training kit			2
@entity5 owner @entity350 was at @entity151 having stayed away for the majority of matches last season			1
and it looked as if the billionaire was enjoying himself — tv pictures showed him laughing raucously with a pal despite his side trailing in the second half			0
@entity350 has been a target for fans in recent times , but he will be hoping their anger subsides this season after he provided @entity111 with £ 40million to spend on new players .			0

@entity20 runs on to @entity61 backheel to score the winner for @entity2 at @entity151
@entity37 and @entity45 come closest to equaliser for @entity5
@entity29 scores on rebound late on to double @entity2 's lead
tributes before the match to @entity303 and @entity302 , who died on @entity308
