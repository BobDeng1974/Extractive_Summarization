the skylines of the world , an @entity3 desert and even the barren landscape of the @entity5 have been reimagined as part of an annual skyscraper competition			1
more than 480 design teams submitted entries to @entity11 's 2015 contest and a jury of experts chose three winners and awarded 15 other designs with honorable mentions from 480 global entries			1
the first place was awarded to a @entity20 group called @entity21 for its ' natural habitat ' @entity23 , beating the designs for a giant ' @entity26 ' concept at the heart of @entity29 , a bio-pyramid in the @entity31 and @entity32 - a project that blurs the lines between digital and physical worlds			1
the @entity36 was established in 2006 to recognise ' outstanding ideas for vertical living '			1
the first place in this year 's contest was awarded to a team of @entity20 designers for its project @entity23 ( shown )			1
the main body of the building is divided into 11 natural landscapes including open floor plans , water floors , fish tanks lifted up to 98 feet ( 30 metres ) above ground , and jungle areas the @entity11 awards were established in 2006 to recognise ' outstanding ideas for vertical living '			1

' @entity66 said the winners were selected for their ' creativity , ingenuity , and understanding of dynamic and adaptive vertical communities			1
' the first place this year was awarded to @entity21 - a team comprising of designers @entity74 , @entity76 , @entity77 , and @entity78 - from @entity20 for the project @entity23			1
the @entity11 awards were established in 2006 to recognise ' outstanding ideas for vertical living '			1

' they said that the ' lifts ' are divided into multiple plank platforms made from a simple mechanically - driven lever and pulley			2
third place was awarded to @entity101 from @entity102 for his project @entity164 which reimagines the city of the future as the combination of digital and physical worlds - ' a city that grows and morphs instantly according to its residents needs			1
' he explained : ' " tomorrow " we expect a completely different topography of the city			0
' it will be a map which includes cyber worlds with intrinsic geography , laws of physics , qualities and even its own residents			2
it is as though landscapes of computer games have woven into the city space			0
' the residential area of the skyscraper represents a constantly growing and developing spatial complex ... printed by @entity191 or by drone construction			2

' the initial idea is to design a separate anthropogenic microcosm , detached from the harsh @entity5 environment , but based on the dynamic equilibrium between people and nature			0
instead of building on the ground , one entry imagined a structure built into the clouds to control the weather			0
called @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity309 from @entity310 said their design would catch and redistribute clouds ' where they are affluent to scarce '			0
