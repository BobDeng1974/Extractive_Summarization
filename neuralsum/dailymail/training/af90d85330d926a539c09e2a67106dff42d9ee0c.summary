by @entity0 published : 10:26 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:29 est , 7 february 2014 all it takes is a flash of inspiration to come up with a great idea for a publicity stunt			0
officials in @entity9 in southwest @entity10 dreamed up the idea of revamping the lavatories to highlight the region 's place as a major wholesaler of digital cameras			1
they have now commissioned 22 public conveniences to be redesigned to resemble the gadget with which the district is so proudly associated			2
flash : officials in @entity9 in southwest @entity10 's @entity22 had 22 public toilets revamped and made to look like digital cameras on of the councillors behind the scheme said : ' we really want people who come to the region to feel that they are living the digital world experience			1
we are very proud of our achievements			0
' if anybody wants to buy an electronic gadget , they know that this is the best place to come			0
' we have the best prices , the best products , and the best companies			0
' the camera shaped toilets were simply a reflection of the region 's success , designed to reinforce in people 's minds that this is the ' one stop shop for all your digital needs '			1
promotion : the camera - shaped lavatories have become something of a talking point in @entity9 which is famous for selling the gadget pride : a councillor said the design was a recognition of the region 's pride as being associated with digital cameras and the reception to the new public convenience has been positive			1
in fact , the council is now already planning to highlight other locally made products by immortalising the toilets - including computers and mobile phones			0
