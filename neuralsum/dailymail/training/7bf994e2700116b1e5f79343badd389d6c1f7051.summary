@entity0 , 35 , has had more than her fair share of unfair dismissals by boyfriends after 20 or so dates in six weeks , each one more heart - stoppingly exciting than the last , i was pretty sure that @entity7 was @entity8			1
good - looking , with the naughtiest twinkle in his dark - brown eyes , he was also smart , stylish and , most importantly , funny			2
my 35 - year - old head knew perfection was n't possible , but my heart said something different			2
and , from the passionate nature of our relationship , i assumed he was similarly besotted with me			1
naturally , i was desperate to share my good fortune , so i broached the idea that , maybe , we should make our relationship public			1
' wait a bit , ' he said			2
reluctantly , i agreed , even though the last thing i felt like doing was muffling my excitement like some guilty schoolgirl with a crush			2
a few weeks later , the big night came when he invited me to dinner with a few of his friends			2
i climbed the stairs to his flat with my heart in my mouth			2
this must be it , i thought			2
inside there were two men and three girls , all a lot younger than me , and all unnervingly beautiful			1
perhaps the warning signs were there when @entity7 introduced me as ' my friend @entity44 '			1
dinner then proceeded with a slightly odd atmosphere , with @entity7 appearing to show more interest in some of his other guests than me			2
i went into the kitchen to talk to him as he plated up the main course			2
' so , what do you think ? ' he said			2
' of what ? ' i replied			2
' of her , ' he said , nodding in the direction of the dining room and the stunning girl in a tight @entity60 bandage dress and with a veritable cascade of lush dark hair			2
i looked down at my flat shoes through my boyish bob			2
suddenly it became devastatingly clear that this was his way of ditching me			2
not for him a tearful break - up during a walk in the park , nor even a 2am phone call in which he 'll pledge to be my best friend for ever			1
instead , unable to do the decent thing , he invited me around to show me the reason i was being dumped			1
humiliated , i tried to hold on to my dignity - but the risotto stuck in my throat and i gulped down his vintage @entity81 like it was orange squash			2
i 've been dumped by text , during a shouting match in front of hundreds of people at a wedding , and even by a man who got his best friend to call me and tell me			1
forget ' it 's not you , it 's me ' , this was ' it 's not you , it 's her '			0
tennis player @entity96 in happier times with her then boyfriends , golfer @entity99 this experience ( it still makes my spine shiver and fists clench two years later ) came to mind as i read about @entity99 's gallant way of finishing with @entity96 , the @entity104 tennis player			1
she revealed in an interview last week how the @entity108 golfer , the love of her life , ended their three - year relationship just days after their wedding invites had gone out			1
it came in a brief phone call , no longer than a couple of minutes , during which he said nothing except the wedding was off			1
no reasons , no remorse			0
he left those for the press release that he shared with the entire world a couple of hours later			0
@entity96 admitted that the split last may left her ' shocked '			1
' i thought at least it would be face - to - face or something , but there was nothing			0
it was a phone call and i did n't hear from him again , ' she added			1
so what is it about men that they ca n't end relationships with manners , dignity and , yes , some emotion ? why do they think it 'll be easier for the woman if they do n’t show their feelings , rather than shed a tear and at least come up with a lame excuse ? there are ways for men to dispatch a woman , and @entity99 clearly needs some practice			1
as does the spineless worm who dumped my sister after passionately courting her for almost six months			1
literally all he said was ‘ goodbye ’ before walking out			0
no wonder she was left sobbing on my sofa for weeks			0
just last weekend , several years after the event , we had a ceremonial shredding of the love letters - great sheaves of them			0
and , still , she kept asking , ' why ? ' during her emotional outpourings , my sister was lamenting not only the end of a long relationship but the fact there was n't a reason for the ending			1
the loss was bad enough but the not knowing why was worse			0
there must have been a why , it 's just that the man - and , let 's be honest , most men - found it nigh - on impossible to express it			1
women need closure , while men seem able to suppress their emotions and build impenetrable walls around unfinished aspects of their lives , as if those loose ends no longer exist			1
i 've been subjected to many crass dumpings since i first kissed a boy 30 years ago , and i 've no doubt my experiences are pretty standard			0
there was the long - term boyfriend who finished with me as we walked towards a taxi after a party , with the words , ' this is n't working , it 's over			0
' then he jumped in the cab and took off			0
i cried for two months and felt paralysed with regret about the possible reasons for his emotional brutality			0
i obsessed over the fact we argued about whether to eat chips ( me ) or boiled potatoes ( him )			0
was it my personality , fashion sense , family , friends , looks ? the minutiae of my character was endlessly assassinated by my worst enemy - me			0
@entity220 reportedly told his wife @entity221 that he wanted a divorce by text message after weeks of sorrow - drowning , i bumped into him			1
it turned out he 'd got together with a mutual friend who he ' always had a thing about ' , but thought it was best not to tell me			1
he assumed he was being kind - but that 's one of the things that differentiates the sexes : one man 's ' kindness ' is another woman 's ' crass insensitivity '			0
i appreciate there 's never a good way to end a relationship - my preferred exit strategy is to let things get so bad that i ca n't help but finish things - but at least i end it with some explanation			1
and , after three decades of experience , i 've nailed the golden rules for leaving a relationship			1
anything less than six months deserves at least a phone call letting them know where they stand			1
anything over that - especially if the physical bond has morphed into something more serious , with thoughts about ' the future ' - then a face - to - face chat is a necessity			0
you know the scene - tv ominously switched off , wine glass filled , together on the sofa but with little eye contact			0
the lines are just as familiar : ' we can still be friends ' ; ' this is n't about you , it 's me ' ; ' i just think we 've grown apart ' ; ' i 'll always love you ' ; blah , blah , blah ... these are the easy ways out but i 'm not convinced they satisfy any more			0
man up and dignify us with a little honesty , will you ? tell us you ’ve fallen in love with someone else , that you ’re bored with us , ca n't abide our friends or whatever			0
that 's how to dump a woman			1
make it unequivocal and honest			0
it gives us the chance to wipe the slate clean as soon as you 've grabbed your coat and hotfooted it out of the door			0
how refreshing it would be not to behave like a coward , as @entity99 did , or actor @entity290 , who sent a short note by courier to the gorgeous @entity294 actress @entity293 , whom he had been seeing for six years and was pregnant with his child			1
@entity296 , who sent a text to his wife @entity221 saying he wanted a divorce			1
or , as one of my more honest male friends recently admitted to me , cowering under - yes , under - a car when he saw a girlfriend coming to his house in order to ask why he had n’t called her for a week			0
i asked behavioural psychologist @entity307 why men were so incapable of being respectful when dumping a woman			1
' it 's pretty simple , ' she says			0
' it 's all about how comfortable you are with emotion			0
' and if we must gender stereotype , lots of men are not comfortable with it			1
the technology age has made it even easier for them to take the path of least resistance , to disengage with minimal confrontation			0
' perhaps , then , it 's time we women radically changed our approach			0
to stop looking for reasons and to start being selfish			0
to be ruthless not wet , emotionless not soppy , to embrace the clean break rather than look for a made - up excuse			0
so my heart goes out to you , @entity96			1
you ’ve had a rough time but , let 's be honest , it wo n't take you long to find another man - and hopefully this time he 'll be tall enough to allow you to wear high heels			0
you 're only 24 and you certainly do n't need my help on how to find love - but here 's a little advice on what to do if it does n't work out next time : be a man about it .			0
