@entity0 has come under fierce criticism for ditching @entity2 from its new operating system in favour of its own geographical app. some users are fuming over the poor quality of the replacement maps , which have odd routes and preposterous images ( feet is a measurement , not an appendage )			1
but it has now emerged that the damage was entirely self - inflicted - @entity0 made a deliberate decision to dump @entity2 , as the search giant is too much of a threat to its future business			1
oops ! the road to the @entity24 looks more like a roller coaster than a highway on @entity0 's new maps @entity28 or @entity29 ? the @entity30 has become the leaning tower of @entity32 the new maps : with @entity2 removed from the @entity35 , users have been getting to grips with the new - but sometimes inaccurate - solution from @entity0			1
at left , for example , @entity0 thinks 550 @entity40 in @entity41 is 250 ' feet ' away users were highly critical of @entity44 for @entity45 when it was released on wednesday , complaining that there were errors abound in the new application and it was ' pretty but dumb '			1
and when a senior tech executive was asked by the @entity53 whether the change was made by @entity0 itself or by @entity2 , the reply came : ' duh - not @entity2			1
' both companies have worked closely together in developing @entity2 for the @entity35 - a service which many smartphone users have become heavily dependent on			1
but , since @entity2 's @entity58 operating system @entity58 is the main rival to @entity60 , @entity0 has been reluctant to co-operate , and has now decided to go it alone when it comes to mapping for the @entity35			1
the split had apparently been planned for over a year - but when @entity0 got round to releasing its own map software , the response was withering			1
many users are now hoping to hang on until @entity2 makes a @entity2 app for @entity45 - as long as @entity0 does not block the software from appearing on the @entity69			1
architecture ? the @entity71 has been rendered unwalkable ! squashed : someone has sat on @entity73 @entity0 has decided to go it alone and produce their own app , purchasing numerous mapping companies in the past few years to prepare for the transition			1
they worked with @entity80 , @entity81 and other companies for the mapping data , but the venue search results will rely heavily on @entity86 's database , rather than @entity2 's , and are thus vastly inferior			0
while the new app has some improvements , it leaves a lot to be desired			0
@entity2 's popular @entity92 option is no longer available , replaced with @entity0 's wonky 3d option , which shows many structures with photographing ribboning throughout			1
wrong way : at right , @entity0 leads a user to the @entity97 instead of the @entity98 , but do n't worry , the address is in the mail			1
at left , @entity0 gets lost on its way through @entity103 and gives up danger : @entity0 users should be careful driving over the @entity107 in @entity108 @entity110 , we have a problem : several of the corporate offices in downtown @entity110 appear to have gas stations on their roofs ? public transportation routes are also not included in @entity0 's software and landmarks are mislabeled as gas stations , airports , or other unrelated locations			1
' @entity35 customers will suffer , ' @entity121 , an analyst at @entity122 , said to @entity124			2
' @entity0 believes that they can deliver a better experience for customers than @entity2 , but in the short term , @entity2 has a better mapping application			2
' ' what ’s going to happen with the @entity0 maps , is that you ’re literally not going to find things			2
when you do find them , they might be in the wrong place or position geographically			0
and if you do have it , the route to it may not be the optimal route			0
' @entity80 ceo @entity142 sources told the magazine that the company was anxious to scale back it 's relationship with @entity2 , due to the companies ' intense rivalry on the smartphone market			0
@entity2 's @entity58 is now the world ’s most popular smartphone software			0
users that were quick to update have found numerous errors with the new mapping software , complaining about duplicate islands , wrong locations and vanished buildings			2
@entity80 ceo @entity142 , whose company worked to develop the maps , blasted @entity0 , saying that users will get lost if they use the software			1
' they ’re now coming out with the lowest , weakest data set and they ’re competing against @entity2 , which has the highest data set			0
what ’s going to happen with the @entity0 maps , is that you ’re literally not going to find things			2
when you do find them , they might be in the wrong place or position geographically			0
and if you do have it , the route to it may not be the optimal route , ' he said to @entity179			0
directions : at left , @entity0 instructs a driver to take a ferry - rather than a bridge - to cross @entity185 and at right , @entity0 instructs a driver to drive into the tarmac of the airport in @entity189 artistic : @entity191 must have been a consultant on the design destroyed : the @entity193 apparently has had an allergic reaction ? for now , @entity35 users will be able to reach @entity2 through a mobile web browser			1
@entity81 has defended the product saying that as more people use it , it will improve			0
@entity81 defended the integrity of the map software , saying it provided only the data , and was not responsible for how @entity0 used it within the app. a spokesman said : ' the user experience is determined by adding additional features to the map application such as visual imagery			2
' user experience fully depends on the choices these manufacturers make			0
' ' we are confident about our map quality , as selling 65 million portable navigation devices across the world and more than 1.4m @entity81 apps for @entity35 in the past two years reaffirms this quality			2
' @entity219 : @entity0 users hoping to find this comic book store will need some good luck where ? the @entity224 in @entity225 must have grown legs technology blogger @entity227 was n't into the company 's excuses			1
' they 've used their platform dominance to privilege their own app over a competitor 's offering , even though it 's a worse experience for users , ' he said on his website			2
' here in @entity240 , where i live , basic search by building names is profoundly degraded in @entity0 's maps search			2
" @entity247 " does n't find the @entity245 ; on @entity2 it 's the first result			0
' he continued : ' searching for its address " 731 @entity251 " yields that address on @entity251 in @entity71			0
it 's fine to think that perhaps i wanted the address in @entity255 , but even appending " @entity256 , @entity256 " or " @entity240 , @entity256 " still yields the @entity71 address			0
google maps has none of these comprehension issues			0
' the final verdict ? ' @entity0 's made a new product that actually is pretty but dumb , ' he said			0
what a trip : this day - long journey does not require a travel agent !			0

@entity0 is fixing problems as they go along , but users are finding many errors with the app
users may expect some *hiccups* with @entity35 launching today
