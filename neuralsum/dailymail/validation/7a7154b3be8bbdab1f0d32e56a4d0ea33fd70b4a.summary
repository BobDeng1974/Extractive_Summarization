@entity0 may be perennial underachievers in world tennis but when it comes to the sport 's premier team competition @entity4 's host nation continues to punch over its weight			2
in the city of his birth an emotional @entity9 carried his side into the last eight of the @entity15 knockout by fending off a ferocious challenge from @entity19 giant @entity17 to secure a 3 - 2 victory			1
to the deafening acclaim of @entity25 's @entity24 the former @entity22 champion survived a tough opening set to win 7 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 6 against the world number 20 to wrap up the tie with his second point			2
@entity9 celebrates extravagantly after winning the first set on a tie break to leave @entity0 just two sets from the quarter - finals the @entity35 no 1 was spurred on by the @entity25 crowd to secure a 3 - 1 win over the @entity19 and book a quarter - final against @entity39 @entity9 is forced to stretch to reach a backhand as @entity17 put in a much better performance on sunday in the @entity15 against one of the best servers ever seen in tennis @entity9 's coolness in the tiebreaks was the key , as was his ability to save seven break points in the opening set			1
' it was a great win for the team , everyone played their part , ' said @entity9			2
' @entity55 was a key , everyone was pulling in the same direction			0
' i managed to find a way through the first set			0
i was over complicating my service games at first and he was going for broke on the first point of every rally			0
the huge @entity19 showed aggression in a first set where he forced seven break points on the @entity9 serve , but could n't take any of them @entity9 was well supported by a partisan @entity25 crowd as he sought to book @entity0 's place in the @entity15 quarter finals @entity17 plays a forehand on the run as the @entity19 's top player started fast in a game his country needed to win to stay alive in the match @entity9 was not at his best early on , but rallied to take the first set on a tie break after saving three set points @entity82 are through to the elite @entity15 quarter finals for the second year in succession and now face a home tie against @entity39 – 3 - 0 winners over @entity87 - immediately after @entity4 in july			1
if on grass it is likely to be held somewhere like @entity90 or @entity91 , but if they opted for an indoor court it would likely come back to @entity95 , as the fans here have been outstanding in this match			0
' if everyone plays to their abilities we have the chance to win more matches			0
we do n't have huge margin for error but if @entity107 ( @entity108 ) plays like this we have a chance , although @entity39 have huge strength in depth			0
' this match turned out to be remarkably similar to last year 's @entity15 first round against the same opponents : @entity108 upset the @entity19 number one on the first day , before the @entity117 pulled the doubles point back for the @entity19 and then @entity9 finished it off with his second singles win			2
@entity0 captain @entity121 and his staff celebrate as their talisman @entity9 wins a crucial point against the @entity19 @entity17 @entity17 looks stunned during a tough first set where he played plenty of good tennis and earned seven break points , but could n't break through @entity17 looked to have put everything he had into the opener , and looked exhausted after losing the first - set breaker @entity17 once beat @entity132 in an away match against @entity134 so is no shrinking violet in the cauldron of @entity15 competition and @entity35 captain @entity121 – low profile but with an excellent record in this job – knew that he could be a danger			1
that did not take long to be confirmed and the 6 ' 10 ' @entity19 , revelling in his underdog status unlike on friday against @entity108 , came out swinging			0
a more under pressure was a little hesitant and he had to fend off seven break points in total before the tiebreak , once at 1 - 2 , three times at 3 - 4 and three more times at 4 - 5			1
@entity17 twice took enormous forehand cuts and shaky second serves and will have been massively frustrated not to have taken the lead			0
@entity121 whispers some advice and encouragement into his player 's ear between games as @entity9 booked @entity0 's place in the last eight @entity9 continued to show his emotion as he began to find his best form in front of a raucous crowd in @entity25 @entity9 's serve had come under pressure in the first set , but as @entity17 tired the @entity35 no 1 became more secure his serve was as potent as ever but , crucially , he double faulted at the start of the tiebreak and after that @entity9 clung on to his lead to clinch it 7 - 4 , a massive psychological blow as he had been outplayed			1
the nerves of him and another hugely committed crowd were eased by that , especially as @entity17 needed to play nearly five hours on friday			0
a brilliant backhand lob at 3 - 2 in the second set secured the key break there , but to give @entity17 his due he kept fighting to take it to second tiebreak			1
@entity9 went ahead 6 - 2 and then finally finished it with a swinging serve ace at 6 - 4 to complete his weekend 's work			1
@entity9 stretches for a forehand as he wore down his opponent before pulling out an array of stunning passing shots in the later sets @entity17 had played five sets in his defeat to @entity108 on friday , and the effort caught up with him after a brave first set on sunday @entity17 is consoled by his @entity19 @entity15 captain @entity193 as he struggles to cope with @entity9 's athleticism in @entity25			2

@entity9 takes first set on a tie - break after saving seven break points
@entity35 no 1 breaks @entity17 's serve for the first time in sixth game of second set , takes set 6 - 3
@entity9 wins third set tie break to seal 3 - 2 victory in the tie
@entity0 will face @entity39 at home in july in quarter - finals
