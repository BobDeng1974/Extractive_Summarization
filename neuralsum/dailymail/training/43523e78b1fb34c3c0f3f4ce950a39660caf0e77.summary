@entity10 , who is on trial accused of killing supermarket worker @entity12 , told the court he used the internet and a network of ' live sources ' - some made in prison - to investigate rumours of child abuse			1
he assigned possible offenders militaristic ' call signs ' depending on the strength of evidence against them , he said			2
hit - list : @entity10 , 28 , left , put @entity12 , 57 , right , at the top of a list of men he planned to kill because he suspected they were paedophiles , the court heard the jury at @entity31 was told @entity10 , 28 , started the operation after being acquitted and freed in september 2010 following a retrial for the murder of the @entity35 , whom he accused of abusing him , for which he had already served nine years of a life sentence			1
while on remand ahead of the second trial , the court heard today , he took part in ' therapy sessions ' at @entity45 prison in @entity46 , designed as a form of restorative justice to try to treat sex offenders			2
but he overheard offenders planning a paedophile ring			2
@entity10 told the court today he investigated @entity12 , 57 , after being told a ' rumour ' about him , saying the police lacked enough power to catch paedophiles			1
giving evidence , he told the court that after ' philosophy ' discussions with other prisoners on how to deal with sex offenders , he decided he wanted to track down ' rapists , paedophiles , those who force women into prostitution , sex traffickers ' by breaking the law and hacking into profiles on sex websites to see what users were doing - something he claimed the police can not do			1
' there are so many paedophiles in this country , over 600,000 who just offend against children , ' he said			0
' even if i stopped more than 100 a day i would take over 20 years to deal with them			0
it is impossible for one person to stop them all			0
claims : @entity10 , left , alleged that he was abused by @entity35 , right			1
@entity10 served eight years of a life sentence for the clergyman 's killing , but was later acquitted of his murder ' i commend the police and the child protection agencies for what they are doing but they are beaten by certain rules and regulations			1
' if you really want to find out ... you have to look at their ( website ) profiles and see who they are talking to			0
it is not hard to find these people but the police are beaten by the rules			0
' while in the witness box @entity10 used military terms like ' in the field ' to describe how he investigated claims of sex offending , using call signs like ' @entity108 ' to describe a ' suspect ' and ' tango ' to describe a ' target ' against whom he had proof of illegal activities			2
one they had been ' dealt with ' they were reclassified as ' x-ray '			0
he admitted reading books about intelligence agencies to help him plan his activities			0
he said he tracked down @entity12 after a contact gave him the name of a ' @entity123 in @entity124 , showed him a digital picture and told him a ' rumour ' of what he was alleged to have done			1
@entity10 said he investigated and met several men called @entity12 before he found mr @entity12			1
mr @entity12 was killed during the early hours of january 11 last year after @entity10 , whom he had met for sex , inflicted five severe blows to his head with a hammer and strangled him with a shoelace , the court has been told previously			1
the jury has also heard that @entity10 wrote to his girlfriend , @entity137 , while on remand , admitting the killing			1
it read : ' i know you do not understand why i did what i did			0
in short , i simply wanted to stop some really nasty people hurting kids , the young , the weak , the vulnerable			0
' i never planned to hurt him , i just wanted to stop him , get evidence on him to get him to confess and tell people what he was			0
' @entity10 went on to tell miss @entity137 that when mr @entity12 confessed to him he lost control , the court heard			1
he added : ' you have no idea how mad it makes me knowing that someone can do that and they think it 's okay			0
' it 's disgusting and they have no idea how much it destroys a person and damages them , and no one gives a damn about it			0
' the trial has already heard there is no evidence that mr @entity12 was a paedophile			2
@entity10 , of @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , denies murder but admits manslaughter by way of diminished responsibility .			2

' cold - *blooded* killer ' @entity10 told court he used the internet and sources in prison to draw up a hit - list of men
@entity186 told there was not a ' shred of evidence ' that victim @entity12 , 57 , was a paedophile
@entity10 *bludgeoned* @entity194 , who he met on the internet , to death with a hammer then *walked* in to police *station* to admit to the killing , jury told
defendant had been convicted and later acquitted of murdering alleged sex offender @entity35 .
