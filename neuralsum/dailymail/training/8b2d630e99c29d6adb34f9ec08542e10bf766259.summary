swollen limbs , a sore throat , headaches , heavy legs , dehydration , dizziness and exploding ear drums			2
the symptoms of flying are enough to make you want to stay at home			1
your body is a finely tuned temple and low oxygen levels , humidity and sudden changes of pressure can wreak havoc with it			1
luckily there are a few things you can do to combat the worst effects of flying			1
at that elevation air pressure is far lower than it is at ground level			1
as a result , cabins are pressurised to resemble an altitude of roughly 7,000 feet , that 's 11 pounds per square inch			1
still , it 's the same effect on your body as if you were sitting on top of a mountain for hours at a time and can cause oxygen levels to dive			1
that can be a problem for passengers with conditions such as heart or lung disease who should fly with an oxygen concentrator , or not at all			2
but even the healthiest among us can feel the ill effects of less oxygen after a couple of hours on board			1
lower blood oxygen levels ( decreasing to 93 per cent at cruising altitude ) cause fatigue and brain fog as well as headaches and dizziness			1
above the clouds : planes fly at 35,000 ft where the air is thinner and smoother what can you do ? 1			1
) if you are worried about the effects of low oxygen levels in blood because of a pre-existing condition consult your gp before flying			1
) put down the gin and tonic			0
alcohol exacerbates symptoms as it interferes with your cells ' metabolism making them less efficient at absorbing oxygen			0
it can also cause you to dehydrate faster ( more on that below )			0
smoking can deplete oxygen levels by up to eight per cent before you 've even boarded the flight			2
give yourself and your lungs a fighting chance by ditching tobacco well in advance of your flight			0
) travel on a @entity103 which has higher air pressure and humidity levels than other jetliners , a lower cabin altitude of 6,000 ft and fewer pollutants			1
many airlines now use the aircraft , check @entity111 before booking to see if your flight does			0
@entity114 , flight planning director at @entity116 - based @entity115 says , ' on flights of eight , 10 or more hours , we think people will arrive feeling fresher			2
' cabins are pressurised to feel like 7,000 ft , which is like sitting on top of a high mountain for hours on end passenger friendly : @entity103 has higher oxygen levels , low humidity and fewer pollutants sitting ducks we all know that sitting for extended periods in painfully upright , narrow chairs is uncomfortable , but it can also be dangerous , especially for older passengers who suffer poor circulation			1
the @entity135 ( @entity135 ) warns : ' being seated for a long time , such as on flights longer than about four hours , may increase the risk of developing blood clots in the veins in your legs ( also known as deep vein thrombosis or @entity143 )			1
' it also does n't help blood oxygen levels as blood pools in your legs and feet , preventing efficient circulation of oxygenated blood around the body and brain causing more dizziness and even fainting			2
what can you do ? 1			0
) the @entity135 recommends walking up and down the aisles and doing small exercises ( airlines often provide exercise information in their in - flight magazines or entertainment systems ) to boost blood flow			1
) compression stockings help prevent blood collecting in the lower limbs and uncomfortable swelling			0
) the @entity166 recommends taking low - dose aspirin ( 100 â€“ 150 mg ) the day before flying , during the flight and for three days after to improve blood flow by thinning the blood and making it less likely to clot			2
) wear loose fitting clothing in breathable fabrics which wo n't constrict veins or blood flow and keep you from over heating			0
talk a walk : @entity135 recommends getting up and stretching your legs , taking aspirin and compression stockings ready for landing pressure inside the cabin fluctuates as the plane lands			1
to the average passenger that will feel equivalent to descending at roughly 350 feet a minute , as you drop from the pressurised cabin level of 7,000 feet to zero in about twenty minutes			1
as a result your ears pop and can hurt like hell			0
the reason ? eustachian tubes inside the ear are opening and closing , trying to balance and match the changing pressure inside your ear with that outside your head			1
if you have a cold the effects will be more painful as these tubes wo n't be able to open or close as easily and the eardrum will bulge inwards			0
worst case scenario , your eardrum could rupture			0
what can you do ? 1			0
) @entity208 , yawn , suck sweets or swallow to open the @entity212 tubes			0
) failing that , try the @entity214 manoeuvre , named after @entity215 , a seventeenth century physician who obsessed over ears and pioneered the technique			0
hold your nose , keep your mouth shut and forcefully exhale			0
) make sure you are awake during landing ready to do both points above			0
) take a prescription decongestant or antihistamine on the day of and before flying			2
) buy air pressure - regulating ear plugs which slow the rate of air pressure on the ear drum			1
ear - nough ! @entity230 changes in pressure during landing makes ears pop and can burst ear drums eustachian tubes inside the ear open and close to regulate the pressure inside the ear with the outside dryness the air you breathe in an airplane is sucked in from the outside			1
it flows through the engine , then gets compressed , cooled , filtered , and pumped into the cabin			2
at high altitudes , that can make the plane environment drier than a desert as it contains 66 per cent less water than at sea level			0
the @entity253 and air - conditioning engineers ( @entity255 ) recommends humidity at between 30 and 64 per cent for humans to be comfortable			1
in an aircraft , it can drop to two per cent			0
on short flights this amounts to dry mouth and nose and on longer flights can mean headaches , dizziness , susceptibility to infection and dehydration			2
parched : the altitude that jetliners fly can make the pressurised air system feel dryer than a desert what can you do ? 1			1
) fly on crowded flights			1
it sounds horrible but moisture from other passengers ' breathing and perspiration can increase the relative humidity dramatically , according to the @entity135			1
' in the instance of an eight - hour flight in a cd - 10 with 265 passengers , the humidity level can rise to 20 percent ; the same flight with only 108 passengers sees this level fall to 2 per cent , ' they say			2
) budget flights do n't have free water on tap			2
buy a bottle once you 've gone through security and take it on board with you instead			0
wellness manager and nutritionist at @entity302 , @entity303 , says , ' it is tough to get the balance right , you want to remain hydrated but do n't want to drink so much that you are constantly queuing for the loo			2
a good indication of adequate hydration is having smooth , hydrated lips			0
i would advise between one and two cups of water per hour			0
' the more the merrier : moisture from other passengers ' breathing and perspiration can increase humidity 3			1
) avoid alcohol or caffeinated drinks which can act as diuretics making you dehydrate faster			0
) contact lens wearers : keep a bottle of solution ( under 100ml , of course ) in your hand luggage and remove lenses early to avoid discomfort later on as they shrivel against your eyeball			0
use the solution to rejuvenate tired eyes and lenses throughout the flight .			0

cabins are pressurised to 7,000ft and feel like sitting on top of a mountain
@entity103 has improved air pressure and humidity
@entity135 gives advice on how to not feel terrible while flying
perspiration from crowded flights can balance cabin humidity levels
