having got shot of one undeniably talented but possibly unhinged centre forward , @entity0 are now close to recruiting another who offers even greater chance of fireworks			1
@entity6 ’s return to the @entity7 is on the cards , with @entity9 seemingly changing his mind over the former @entity12 striker who brought drama by the rocket load during his previous spell in @entity16			1
while at @entity12 , @entity6 set off fireworks in his bathroom to accidentally start a fire that caused £ 200,000 worth of damage , threw darts at a youth team player for fun , and staged a mock sword - fight with a friend using a rolling pin during a late - night meal at a curry house that broke team curfew			1
his time in @entity55 came to an acrimonious end as he threatened to take the club to a @entity7 tribunal over their £ 340,000 fine issued for his extensive periods banned following red cards			1
in his last full season at @entity12 he missed 11 of 54 matches in all competitions through suspensions , including three @entity66 games for a kung - fu kick on @entity69 ’s @entity68			1
do @entity0 really need another player with a proclivity for enforced absences as a result of on - field indiscretions ? @entity6 : @entity6 left the @entity7 in 2013 , but could be on his way back with @entity0 enigma : @entity6 has played for both @entity76 and @entity77 and is an extremely controversial character proven : @entity6 does have a very good goalscoring record and has shown his worth in the @entity66 big stage : @entity6 netted twice against @entity16 at the @entity83 in @entity84 to hand @entity85 a 2 - 1 victory stats : @entity6 's @entity7 record ( via @entity88 ) their bid to take @entity6 initially on loan did include the potential for a ‘ good behaviour ’ clause , allowing a termination of the deal if the 24 - year - old decided to strap a @entity98 to a @entity100 terrier – or some other such jolly			1
but that was slapped down by @entity77 and a permanent transfer worth some £ 16million has instead been accepted			1
the appeal for @entity9 is based on @entity6 ’s ability with the ball and experience of the @entity108 top - flight and @entity110 ’s elite competition			2
he is a beguiling presence , as his goal against @entity16 at the @entity83 illustrated , and remarkably cool from 12 yards , missing not a single spot - kick at @entity12			2
he scored 20 @entity7 goals in 33 starts for @entity12 ( 21 appearances came from the bench ) and has 26 @entity120 goals in 43 games for @entity122 but , simply , the @entity123 does not occupy the same plane as his @entity126 counterpart , which you imagine would need to be the case given his magnetism to mayhem			1
flashpoint : @entity6 had a number of run - ins during his explosive relationship with @entity136 discipline : @entity6 was sent off four times during his times at @entity12 , often at important times title : @entity6 ( left ) won the @entity7 with @entity12 in 2012 and scored some important goals expect fireworks : @entity6 fronting a @entity145 safety campaign just after the infamous incident sending a message : @entity6 with his famous ' @entity149 ? ' t - shirt at @entity150 in 2011 kung fu fighting : @entity6 was sent off for aiming this flying kick at @entity69 's @entity153 in 2011 @entity20 @entity7 apps : 110 @entity7 goals : 69 @entity155 , 0 @entity156 @entity6 @entity7 apps : 54 @entity7 goals : 20 @entity157 @entity20 scored 31 goals in 33 @entity7 games and linked up beautifully with @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
before he bit @entity163 those factors balanced out the bother			0
@entity165 is guaranteed with @entity6 , but is the rest ? ostensibly , he is a good guy with a wayward mind who will perform outrageous acts on the spur of the moment			2
but @entity9 will have to work hard to ensure the potential for unrest among the squad is worthwhile			0
pictures would regularly surface of @entity6 going tete - a - tete with @entity136 at training			2
not an unfamiliar occurrence in general at clubs but the frequency clearly tired his manager , who had to intervene after one particularly ugly tackle by @entity6 on @entity183			2
@entity9 does not seem wholly convinced			0
he privately expressed reservations about the @entity85 striker 's mentality and character during the club ’s @entity189 tour this month , saying : ‘ i was asked the question about @entity6 last week and spoke about what a talent he is and excellent player he is			1
but i can categorically tell you that he will not be coming to @entity0			2
’ @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 have all been looked at but failed to materialize for various reasons so it seems @entity6 is a late – if not last – resort			2
with a player like him doubt can create cracks , and cracks produce ructions			0
ructions are good for newspapers , but not exactly productive for a team embarking on their most important season in years			0
couple : the @entity123 striker and his partner @entity215 in @entity216 over the summer @entity217 ( august 2010 ) just days after signing for @entity12 , @entity6 hits the headlines after crashing his @entity219 en route to the club 's training ground			1
@entity6 was found carrying £ 5,000 in cash at the time of the accident and when police asked why , he reportedly replied : ' because i am rich			1
' @entity228 ( november 2010 ) @entity6 scored his first @entity7 goals in a 2 - 0 win at @entity231 but the achievement was marred when he was sent off following a clash with @entity234			1
@entity235 ( december 2010 ) city boss @entity136 said @entity6 must change his attitude following his claims he had never heard of @entity238 after beating the @entity240 midfielder to @entity241 's @entity243 award			2
@entity244 ( march 2011 ) @entity6 again hit trouble after it emerged he threw a dart at a @entity12 youth team player			1
no one was hurt in the incident and he escaped punishment			0
@entity251 ( march 2011 ) @entity6 apologised to his team - mates after being sent off during a @entity254 tie with @entity69 for a reckless challenge on @entity153			0
@entity256 ( july 2011 ) @entity6 was immediately substituted by an enraged @entity136 after performing a pirouette and back - heeling wide when clean through on goal in a pre-season friendly against @entity260			0
@entity261 ( october 2011 ) the @entity123 had another run - in with the emergency services after a firework was set off in the bathroom of his home , triggering a fire			0
the next day , he scored in the @entity55 derby and celebrated by revealing a t - shirt which read ' why always me ? ' @entity271 ( november 2011 ) the third red card of @entity6 's @entity12 career arrived in a league match against @entity0 , the 21 - year - old dismissed for two yellow cards			1
@entity277 ( december 2011 ) @entity6 broke a club 48 - hour curfew by visiting a curry house ahead of a match against @entity281			0
@entity282 ( december 2011 ) just days after @entity6 's curfew lapse , he again attracted negative headlines after pictures emerged of a training - ground bust - up with team - mate @entity287			0
@entity288 ( january 2012 ) @entity6 was charged with violent conduct by the @entity290 , and subsequently handed a four - match ban , after appearing to stamp on the head of @entity294 's @entity293 during a @entity7 match			1
@entity296 ( march 2012 ) @entity6 gatecrashed the press conference to announce the appointment of @entity299 as @entity76 's new coach			0
@entity301 ( april 2012 ) @entity6 was sent off for two bookable challenges on @entity240 full - back @entity303			0
he was also guilty of a shocking knee - high challenge on @entity307 midfielder @entity306			0
@entity308 ( january 2013 ) @entity6 clashed with @entity136 during training with the pair pulled apart by coaches			0
