@entity0 , who is understood to have attended terrorist training camps in @entity8 , absconded from a @entity30 and @entity31 ( @entity29 ) notice after ripping off his electronic tag			1
mrs may insisted the police and security services did not believe @entity0 was involved in current terrorist planning and that great efforts were being made to find him			2
but ms @entity13 told @entity38 that a tweet from @entity19 taxi news service @entity41 suggested @entity8 - born @entity0 had evaded detection by picking up a ride less than half - a - mile from @entity44 on @entity12			1
in a fierce exchange with home secretary @entity47 , ms @entity13 said : ‘ are you worried that surveillance can be shaken off simply by jumping into a black cab ? @entity0 , who is thought to have raised funds for @entity4 , was originally handed a control order and forced to live in the @entity53 away from his network of friends			1
but under the new @entity29 regime , introduced last year thanks to support from the @entity58 , he was able to move back to @entity19			2

she said : ‘ you allowed @entity0 to return to @entity19			2
you have not answered the question about whether it would have been harder to abscond in the @entity53 , where he was made to live under a control order - harder to get help from his associates , harder to hide , harder to get forged papers			1
’ ms @entity13 said absconds had stopped under control orders once the powers were toughened up - including greater use of relocation			0
and she added : ‘ you chose to ditch relocation , you have personally made it easier for people to abscond			0
‘ other people previously relocated under control orders are also now back in @entity19 on @entity29			2
