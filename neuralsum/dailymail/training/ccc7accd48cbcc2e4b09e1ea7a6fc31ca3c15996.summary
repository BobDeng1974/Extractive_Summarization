by @entity0 published : 00:39 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 9 october 2013 kidney operation : veteran sports broadcaster @entity2 has revealed that he suffered from kidney cancer probably brought on by passive smoking broadcaster @entity2 revealed yesterday that has been battling kidney cancer			1
the veteran sports commentator described his shock upon learning the disease was linked to smoking – despite the fact he has never smoked a cigarette			2
mr @entity2 , 78 , was given the diagnosis six months ago after abnormalities were detected in a urine sample during a routine check - up			1
he underwent surgery a few weeks ago at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , to remove a tumour , which also saw him lose one healthy kidney and part of his second kidney			1
he has now been given the all - clear			1
doctors said years of passive smoke during his career as a journalist almost certainly caused the cancer			2
@entity31 - born mr @entity2 said his cancer was of the ‘ sleekit kind ’ , one that displayed no symptoms and never prevented him from enjoying hobbies including golf and cross-country running			1
he said : ‘ when i was told this condition was closely linked to smoking and informed them i had never had a cigarette in my mouth in my entire life , the doctors were adamant i was almost certainly a victim of passive smoking			2
‘ i had to add things up			2
as i am fond of a dram or two , i had spent many pleasant hours in howffs around the world with people around me creating the conditions of @entity52 at its worst			0
‘ i could take you to a bar in @entity56 where , before the ban , i could sit happily for hours , as a non-smoker , naively savouring the almost exotic aroma of the wonderful @entity62 @entity61 cigarettes , as innocently as breathing in the fragrance of a pine forest			0
’ he added : ‘ i also worked blissfully in editorial offices and press boxes in the past , which had the sulphuric stench of @entity69 about them			0
’ doctors told mr @entity2 the cancer could have been developing for up to five years and might have turned life - threatening had it not been caught by chance this year			1
veteran broadcaster : mr @entity2 believes that years of working in smokey studios and press boxes led to his illness the broadcaster , who lives in @entity79 , @entity20 , with his wife @entity80 , paid tribute to the ‘ unsung heroes ’ in the @entity83 who saved his life			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve spent years writing about overpaid , pampered footballers			0
now i have a chance to praise the real heroes of the medical profession , who have saved my life			0
‘ when i learn that kidney cancers are occurring among people in their forties , that @entity94 is the only nation in the @entity95 where lung cancer remains the most common cancer , i shudder at the thought of how these dedicated people i encountered in the past couple of months will cope with a tsunami of ailments hitting them in future , as our society seems largely indifferent to the self - immolations of reckless lifestyles			1
‘ yet hopefully my narrative will encourage some to see the value of grappling with any uncertainties about their health in the knowledge that even in a harassed medical system , skills and care exist to turn an early diagnosis into an affirmation of life , not its reverse			0
‘ even were it to mean you have to sacrifice an organ in the process , as in my case , what you are being offered is the privilege of bartering with mortality			0
in such circumstances there is no such a thing as a bad deal			0

mr @entity2 was diagnosed six months ago during a routine check - up
