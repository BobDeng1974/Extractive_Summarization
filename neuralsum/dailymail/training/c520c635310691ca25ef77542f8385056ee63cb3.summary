by @entity0 published : 12:14 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 19:33 est , 25 september 2013 some commonly prescribed statins can impair memory , scientists have found statins taken by millions of @entity6 could lead to memory loss , researchers have warned			1
in tests , one of the widely - prescribed drugs cut the ability to form new memories and recall information			0
the medication , called pravastatin , was found to have an adverse effect on rats			1
@entity19 researchers say their study tallies with reports of statin patients feeling ‘ fuzzy - headed ’ and ‘ befuddled ’			1
the team also said it was ‘ highly likely ’ other statins affected memory loss			1
but other experts dismissed the research and insisted the benefits of statins outweigh any side - effects			1
statins , which lower levels of ‘ bad ’ cholesterol in the blood , are the most widely prescribed drugs in @entity6 and are taken by up to eight million people			0
used to treat those at risk of heart problems and strokes , they are credited with saving thousands of lives a year and some doctors believe that everyone over the age of 50 should be given them			0
however , a range of documented side - effects includes muscle and liver problems , blurred vision , fatigue and difficulty sleeping , leading some doctors to argue they should be reserved only for those at risk of heart problems			2
the @entity19 neuroscientists looked at the effect of two of the most commonly prescribed statins – pravastatin and atorvastatin – on the memory of rats			1
rodents given pravastatin found it more difficult to learn where a sugary treat was hidden , they discovered			1
they also struggled to recall an object they had seen before			0
this behaviour was likened by researchers to someone knowing that they have car keys , but not being able to remember where they left them			2
it is thought statins may be reducing levels of cholesterol in the brain or affecting its nerve cells directly			0
a quarter of the body ’s cholesterol is found inside the head , where it aids the transmission of signals between brain cells			2
the problems vanished shortly after the animals were taken off pravastatin			2
@entity96 did not affect memory , according to a report in the journal @entity100			1
it is unclear why pravastatin affected memory , as the drug is not thought to be able to cross into the brain and atorvastatin is			1
@entity106 ( pictured ) , with the brand name @entity106 , has adverse effects on working and recognition memory			1
however , atorvastatin , with the brand name @entity96 , does not have any effect the @entity19 researchers said patients on statins should take note of the findings and warned that it is ‘ highly likely ’ other statins may also affect memory			1
professor @entity121 said : ‘ if you notice you are suffering cognitive problems or people around you recognise you are suffering problems , go back to your gp and ask for a different statin and you might find the problem disappears			0
’ others have described the advice as ‘ total overkill ’			0
consultant cardiologist @entity132 , a member of the @entity133 , said large - scale studies on frail and elderly people had failed to find any evidence that statins damage memory			2
‘ i do n’t do rat research , i do large - scale population research , ’ he said			0
‘ there is a reason that people are on statins – and that is to reduce the risk of heart disease and strokes			0
’ the drugs watchdog , the @entity148 and @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , said memory loss is already listed as a potential side - effect of statins			0
a spokesman added : ‘ the benefits of statins are well established and outweigh the risk of side - effects in most patients who take them			0
we are aware of this study and , as with all medicines , the safety of statins continues to be monitored closely			0

@entity106 , with the brand name @entity106 , has been found to impair memory
@entity96 , with the brand name @entity96 , does not , say @entity19 researchers
the adverse effects of pravastatin on memory can be *reversed* by *stopping* the medication
