at first glance , the web may appear to be an almost random mass of information			2
however , researchers say that in fact , there is a ' @entity8 ' effect - meaning any web page is connected to any other by just 19 clicks			1
the statistic echoes the famous ' six degrees of @entity8 ' game , which claims anyone on @entity15 can be linked to the actor through just six people			2
the @entity19 project is one of several aiming to show the web graphically			2
in this image , based on 2005 data , red lines represent links between web pages in @entity27 , green for @entity28 , the @entity29 and @entity30 , blue for @entity31 , yellow for @entity33 and white for unknown ip addresses			1
estimates of exactly how big the web is vary dramatically because many pages are ' hidden ' in services such as @entity39 or in other private sites			1
however , according to the often quoted site worldwidewebsize.com , the most recent figure , as of monday , 18 february , is 14.81billion pages			0
' as the @entity45 began to grow in the 1990s , it was thought that it most probably had the properties of a random network , ' says @entity49 physicist @entity48			1
the researchers originally determined this by constructing algorithms that collected all the links on a web page and then followed them to their destinations , and repeating the process over and over again			0
his research , first published in @entity58 in 1999 , has now been expanded and published in the prestigious @entity59			0
his team found that in fact , any page on the web can be linked to any other via a surprisingly small number of clicks , known as the ' small world property '			1
it say ' that two nodes are likely to be connected , even in such a very large and sparse scale - free network as the @entity45 , by a relatively short path of nodes — in the case of the @entity45 , the path length is about 19 , ' said professor @entity48			1
he claims the key to the web 's fast expansion yet small ' @entity8 number ' is the emergence of massive ' hubs ' such as @entity39 and @entity81			1
' such networks are in effect held together by a small number of highly connected hubs , ' he writes			1
' this scale - free property is an important organizing principle for the @entity45			0
' rather than virtually all nodes having more or less the same degree , we should expect a few nodes to be very highly connected , and the vast majority to have smaller degree than the average			0
' however , he warns that the system may cause problems should the ' superhubs ' such as @entity39 and @entity81 be attacked by hackers			1
' the flip side of this is that , in the event of a targeted attack , where the most connected nodes are deliberately removed first , then the network will be destroyed very quickly			2
' this is the @entity107 ’ heel of a scale - free network , ' he said			2
the first full @entity110 map created by the @entity111 in 2003 several projects have attempted to show the web as a single image , to give users an idea of what the connection actually looks like			0
one of the most impressive is the @entity111 , started by @entity119 in 2003 to create publicly available visualizations of the web			0
' this project was created to make a visual representation of a space that is very much one - dimensional , a metaphysical universe , ' said @entity119			0
' the data represented and collected here serves a multitude of purposes : modeling the @entity110 , analyzing wasted ip space , @entity132 space distribution , detecting the result of natural disasters , weather , war , and aesthetics / art. ' today the image has been used free of charge across the globe and is part of the permanent collection at @entity144 ( @entity144 ) and the @entity145			0
' in the map ( pictured right ) , for example , red lines represent links between web pages in @entity27 , green for @entity28 , the @entity29 and @entity30 , blue for @entity31 , yellow for @entity33 and white for unknown ip addresses			1
although the most recent visualization is several years old , @entity153 reports that he ’s currently working on a new version of the project that will be released soon			0
' when the time is right , i will release the new version of the project that i have slowly been building over the past five years , ' he says on his web site .			0

@entity49 physicist claims that because of huge ' superhubs ' like @entity81 and @entity39 , web pages are more connected to each other than expected
warns that this effect could be used to attack the web - with attacks of the ' *superconnecters* ' being the *achilles* heel of the *online* world
