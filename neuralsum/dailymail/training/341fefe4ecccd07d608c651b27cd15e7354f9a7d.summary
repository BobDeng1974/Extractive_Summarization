by @entity0 published : 02:38 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 06:46 est , 16 may 2012 the @entity2 crisis has delivered a bonus for @entity5 holidaymakers who can expect 10.5 per cent more spending power on the @entity8 islands or @entity10 resorts			1
for every £ 500 converted to euros , a family will get an extra £ 47.41 this year compared to the summer of 2011			1
that means more ice creams for the children , a glass of wine or two more with meals or entry to an attraction or theme park			2
for those travelling further afield , the relative strength of sterling against other currencies will deliver an even bigger increase in spending power			1
bonus : @entity5 holidaymakers can expect 10.5 per cent more spending power on the @entity8 islands or @entity10 resorts due to the @entity2 crisis for example , someone travelling to @entity32 in @entity33 will get 24.5 per cent more for their money this year , or around an extra £ 86 for every £ 500 that is converted to the local currency , the real			1
similarly , the pound will buy 15.7 per cent more @entity41 pesos , delivering extra spending power to the many @entity5 who holiday in @entity44 or the @entity45			1
visitors to @entity47 will get 16.7 per cent more for their money this year			1
if you are thinking of taking a cheap holiday to @entity51 , it ’s worth taking precautions in case the country leaves the euro while you are there			2
even if @entity51 decides to quit the euro today , it ’s unlikely the currency will stop becoming legal tender immediately			2
it will take time for a new currency , such as the old drachma , to come back in			0
for trips soon , any currency bought should be safe			0
but experts advise taking a few extra hundred euros in cash than you normally would			0
this is because of fears that cash machines and electronic banking systems could freeze up for days if @entity51 crashed out of the euro			0
and try to split your euros into smaller notes			0
however , there is a further concern			0
each country in the euro has its own marked coins and notes			0
to the untrained eye , there is little difference between a @entity8 € 1 coin and a @entity51 € 1 coin , and they are also accepted in any other eurozone country as a matter of course			1
the fear is that should @entity51 withdraw from the euro , the ‘ @entity51 euros ’ may stop being accepted in other countries or be worth less than the normal euro			0
however , experts say this is highly unlikely as it would be practically impossible to administer			0
while holidays in the @entity103 will be relatively cheaper in terms of daily spending , the strength of the pound against other @entity101 currencies has been even more marked			1
for example , the pound is now some 23 per cent stronger against the @entity108 zloty than the summer of 2011 , while it is 20.8 per cent stronger against the @entity111 forint			0
money will also go further this year in @entity113 and @entity114			1
the figures , which have been collated by @entity116 , will encourage many families to make their summer holiday choices based on where they can best value			0
at the same time , many may decide to buy their summer spending money now to take advantage of the good rates			1
the @entity116 research shows the pound has made gains against 24 of 30 leading holiday currencies over the past year			2
compared to a year ago , the pound is down by 0.7 per cent against the dollar , 1 per cent against the @entity130 dollar , 1.1 per cent against the @entity132 dong , 1.8 per cent against the @entity134 dirham and 4.1 per cent against the @entity136 shilling			2
@entity137 , @entity138 , said : ‘ although the increasing value of sterling against the euro has dominated the headlines , there are very few places where the pound is not packing a stronger punch this year			2
' our advice is for people to keep a close eye on exchange rates for all the destinations they are considering so they can judge where they will get the best return on their money			0
' he added : ‘ there are signs that the power of the pound is making people increasingly savvy both about their choice of destination and their spending habits			1
