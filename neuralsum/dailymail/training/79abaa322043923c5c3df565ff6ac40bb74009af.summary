perfectly healthy : another @entity19 zoo may put down one of its giraffes just days after @entity7 ( above ) was shot dead and autopsied in the presence of visitors at @entity8 @entity8 's giraffe @entity7 who was put down by the zoo authorities in a controversial action that has drawn widespread condemnation the @entity19 zoo said the drastic move was needed to combat inbreeding and insisted the display was educational			1
but animal rights campaigners last night condemned the killing of @entity7 , saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in @entity38 ’s top zoos			2
@entity7 ’s plight had triggered worldwide outpourings of protest , including an offer to rehome him in @entity43 , with many saying they were sickened by a zoo killing a healthy animal			1
@entity8 said it was told by the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) that @entity7 was genetically too similar to the other giraffes in its breeding programme			1
because captive animals are bred from a limited gene pool , zoos are monitored to prevent inbreeding and ensure the health of future generations			0

a lion feasts on the remains of @entity7 at @entity8 after the mammal was put down earlier in the day a crown gathers for the public autopsy on @entity7 's body captivated : children watch as the body of the giraffe is butchered in front of them but bosses said the rules of @entity47 membership meant animals could not be transferred to institutions that did not follow its rules on breeding programmes			1
the zoo ’s scientific director , @entity81 , said it was the same as parks culling deer to keep the whole population healthy			0
he said : ‘ giraffes today breed very well , and when they do you have to choose and make sure the ones you keep are the ones with the best genes			0
the most important factor must be that the animals are healthy physically and behaviourally and that they have a good life while they are living , whether this life is long or short			0
’ mr @entity81 said the zoo did n’t give its eight giraffes contraceptives due to ‘ unwanted side effects on the internal organs ’ and in order to allow animals to display natural parenting behaviour			0
according to @entity19 media , @entity8 destroys 20 - 30 animals a year , including bears , tigers and zebras			2
