he is one of @entity2 and @entity3 ’s closest friends and widely regarded as their ‘ court jester ’			1
but @entity6 ’s latest outrageous stunt may well have proved a joke too far			0
a promotional video for his @entity10 bar @entity11 features close - ups of semi-naked dancers ‘ twerking ’ – with @entity15 as a backdrop			1
it ’s a choice of location that could put @entity6 at odds with the @entity20 and has most certainly put him on the wrong side of the law – as filming outside @entity15 without permission is illegal			2
a photo advertising @entity6 's bar @entity25 shows a scantily clad woman posing outside the famous gates of @entity15 still images taken from the video promoting the bar also show bizarrely dressed men and women cavorting in front of @entity15 ( pictured ) the video also shows the actors and dancers gyrating and twerking neither prince @entity2 nor prince @entity3 were involved in the zombie - themed video , now on @entity38 , featuring actors cavorting orgy - style near the @entity41 outside the @entity15 ’s famous gates			1
later , the bizarrely dressed dancers moved on to the @entity44 , the @entity45 and @entity46 , where they were chased away by security staff who claimed they were scaring shoppers			2
the mood portrayed in the video – filmed earlier this month – is not far removed from what actually takes place in @entity11 , a @entity55 - themed bar where topless men wearing giant skulls patrol the club with sparklers			1
a large bottle of champagne costs £ 28,000 and for guests who guarantee to spend at least £ 1,000 behind the bar , drinks are served by skimpily clad dancers gyrating to thudding music , and shots of tequila are delivered by an electric train suspended from the ceiling			1
friends of @entity6 , 32 , acknowledge the @entity73 - educated entrepreneur was well aware that his choice of @entity15 for filming was trading on his @entity77 friendships			2
as @entity78 revealed earlier this year , prince @entity3 is often ushered in and out of @entity11 via a discreet side entrance , and the club is where @entity2 hosted @entity6 ’s stag party in may before he married @entity84 heiress @entity83			2
prince @entity3 ( left ) , and his friend @entity6 ( right ) with masked waitresses from his exclusive @entity55 - themed bar @entity25 one regular at the @entity90 venue , present during the filming , said : ‘ we broke a lot of rules and we are expecting the video to be banned			1
@entity6 obviously knows people will assume he ’s giving a cheeky nod to the fact @entity3 goes to his club			0
’ the filming location outside @entity15 comes under @entity102 control			0
a @entity102 spokesman confirmed that no permission had been sought for filming , adding : ‘ a breach of @entity102 regulations is a criminal offence			0
‘ under the @entity102 and other @entity110 1997 it is an offence to take photographs of still or moving subjects in connection with a business or trade without written permission			0
@entity118 is a matter for the police			0
’ ' @entity122 ' launches on monday 1st december .			0
