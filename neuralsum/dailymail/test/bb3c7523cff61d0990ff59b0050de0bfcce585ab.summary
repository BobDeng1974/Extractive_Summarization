an @entity1 doctor has vowed to confound his medical doubters by proving that he can conduct the world 's first head transplant - in less than an hour			1
surgeon @entity5 , who has no problem with anyone branding him @entity8 , also has not got any qualms with wealthy tycoons using the procedure to get a young body in their quest for eternal life			1
he confirmed that he hopes to operate on his first patient , a @entity16 with a rare genetic muscle wasting disease , and said he will carry out the procedure in @entity20 if he is banned from doing so in the @entity21 or former @entity22			1
pictured here is @entity42 playing dr frankenstein 's monster in the 1931 film potentially he accepts he could be jailed for conducting such an operation in a country where it does not have approval			1
' it 's not a problem			1
if @entity53 and @entity16 say " no " , the surgery will be done in @entity20 , ' he said			1
' i 'm ready for that			1
i 've been studying @entity20 for a few years			1
' you should understand that it 's not simply a medical procedure			1
this surgery has a political meaning			1
' the @entity22 was the first one to send @entity62 to space , @entity28 was the first on the @entity30			2
the country that hosts head transplant surgery for the first time will become a leader like this			2
' but critics say dr @entity5 's plans are a fantasy			1
@entity73 , the director of medical ethics at @entity76 's @entity75 , has described dr @entity5 as ' nuts '			1
and dr @entity78 , president elect of the @entity79 , has said : ' i would not wish this on anyone			1
i would not allow anyone to do it to me as there are a lot of things worse than death			2
' nevertheless severely disabled @entity31 , 30 , a sufferer of @entity38 disease , has volunteered to be a guinea pig , knowing the risks			1
he told @entity93 in an exclusive interview earlier this month : ' my decision is final and i do not plan to change my mind			2
' ' am i afraid ? yes , of course i am			2
but it is not just very scary , but also very interesting			2
' this risks appear huge but dr @entity5 insists it would take him less than an hour to put @entity31 's head on the body of a donor body			1
' @entity106 's head will be cooled to 10 - 15 degrees @entity107 , ' the @entity1 medic said			2
' that is done in cases of surgery on deep areas of the brain			2
' we will have an hour to ' switch ' the head to a different body			1
you need a few minutes to join blood vessels			2
' @entity106 's head will be detached from his body and transferred to another one in a matter of seconds , and the brain 's blood flow will start in about 15 minutes			1
dr @entity5 giving a presentation on his plans			1
he claims he has been ' studying @entity20 for the past few years ' in case he has to perform the operation in @entity20 should @entity53 and @entity16 say no ' i will be explaining all the technical peculiarities on june 12 in @entity131 at an international neurosurgeons ' conference			1
' this @entity135 of the @entity136 will hear that such surgery is not only possible but imminent , he said			2
' i 'll prove it is totally possible to all the sceptics there			2
' he admitted that attaching the head was only the start			2
' the surgery will take a lot of time , the joining process may take up to 18 - 24 hours , ' he said			2
' doctors will be taking turns not to get tired			2
' he added : ' believe me , i receive a lot of queries from surgeons , volunteers from across the globe who 'd like to participate in the surgery			2
' if i wanted , i 'd be able to have an international team of 150 highly - skilled professionals			2
' asked by newspaper @entity162 on the cost of the first surgery , he replied : ' do you love football ? i hate it			2
nonetheless , you have slackers who meaninglessly stroll around the pitch and are paid $ 20 - 30 million a year			1
' i need $ 15 million			2
it 's the price for happiness and health for a lot of people			0
but sponsors prefer spending money on healthy boneheads who ca n't kick a ball			0
' asked if such surgery could be used for ' elderly billionaires to get a young body ' , he claimed he had interest from tycoons seeking to extend their lives			1
' you bet - there are a few funds working on prolonging life expectancy , and they are well - funded			1
' these people came to me and said , " here is the money , but we want our participation to stay secret "			0
' however , i want everything to be transparent			0
doing the surgery in a secret place on a secret island is not my cup of tea , to be honest			0
' he was ready to be branded @entity8			0
in 1970 dr @entity203 transplanted the head of one monkey onto the body of another , as shown in this diagram			1
if mr @entity31 's head were to be successfully transplanted his jugular vein and spinal cords would have to be similarly fused with those of his new donor body dr @entity5 has said his new body swap technique could help paralysed people such as @entity216 ' i am prepared for any nicknames , because it sounds cool and will help to sell more newspapers			1
' but i am very conservative when it comes to funding			0
' when @entity223 or @entity224 ( a @entity16 millionaire supporting the research in artificial intelligence ) fund my project , i 'll come to the cameras with the receipt and say , " this person supported my initiative "			1
' he went on : ' i know what i 'm for and am prepared for it			0
i already have an entire army of enemies			0
' but even if i fail with the project , it 'll be a lot easier for those who carry on after me			0
' he admitted that ' the final goal is immortality ' and brushed aside objections from churches			0
' i 'm not a @entity247 and not even a @entity246			0
but i respect other points of view			0
and i will listen to what the @entity250 has to say			0
but this church has one point of view , and the @entity247 - another			0
' he claims a senior @entity247 figure has said he sees no objections to the surgery , he said , adding : ' in @entity260 and @entity20 , the religious authorities also have n't shown any discontent about that			1
i do n't think the religious aspect will play a huge role			0
dr @entity5 , who currently undertakes experimental surgery near @entity266 , said that he had had ' many ' offers to be his guinea pig in such surgery			1
' my secretary receives queries from all over the world , ' he said			0
' i wo n't disclose the names of other candidates because they have not allowed me to do so			0
' i chose @entity106 for two reasons			0
first , he 's brave enough and ready to go till the end			0
' second , his bravery is based on knowledge , he studied everything the scientists have discovered in the area			0
' this way , i decided , he will be the first one to make history			0
' other lucky people will get a chance to change their lives after him			0
' in his remarkable interview with @entity93 , the would - be patient explained that he had agreed to the surgery because ' i do n't really have many choices			1
@entity224 , a @entity16 millionaire who supports research in artificial intelligence			1
dr @entity5 says he 'd love to ' come to the cameras ' with a receipt to show he had enlisted mr @entity224 's support ' if i do n't try this chance my fate will be very sad			1
with every year my state is getting worse			0
' he confirmed : ' i read many scientific articles on this topic			0
' the idea to transplant not only organs but the head has been studied for a long time even by @entity16 specialists			1
' but an actual transplantation of the human head was never conducted			0
' i contacted professor @entity5 two years ago after reading about his works			1
i offered myself to him to make this operation possible			0
' we have never met , and we just communicate via emails			0
' and for the last two years we 've been talking this idea through and planning the operation			0
' he 's a very experienced neurosurgeon and conducted many serious operations			0
of course he has never done anything like this and we have to think carefully all the possible risks			1
' but in the end it is like with astronauts			0
before the first man we sent into space , 300 different scenarios of something going wrong were thought through but when he actually did it , it was the 301st scenario that happened			0
' he denied his pledge to be a guinea pig is a stunt , and insisted he goes into it with his eyes open			1
severely physically handicapped , he made clear : ' i do understand the risks of such surgery			1
we ca n't even imagine what exactly can go wrong			0
' i 'm afraid that i would n't live long enough to see it happen to someone else			0
' if i want this kind of surgery to happen , i should n't put the responsibility onto someone else but should try it on myself			0
' my family fully supports me			0
they also understand all the risks , and even if they think that it 's too dangerous , they still support me in my decision			1
