but @entity15 mother 's @entity50 , 38 , said the sentence was not long enough			2
she said : ' this sentence is not long enough at all			2
a lot of young people have come to see justice done and the law in practice that is meant to protect us			2
yet they have just seen that it is all an absolute sham and this sentence says it is ok to go out and punch and kill someone			2
' i hope that this man can not close his eyes at night for what he has done to our son			2
i will never ever forgive him			2
' @entity23 was a serving marine and he would have gone to war for his country to protect everyone including the judges and solicitors and the legal system			2
heartbroken : @entity23 , pictured centre , with his family who today criticised his killer 's sentence for not being long enough ' this is how he is repaid			2
this is how he is treated , it is a pathetic justice system			2
he would have gone to war for them and that ’s how they have treated an upstanding marine			2

mr @entity99 , prosecuting , said @entity12 and a friend @entity100 had spent the afternoon and evening drinking five shots of vodka and up to eight pints of lager and playing an @entity105 football game before heading into @entity11 shortly after midnight			1
remorse : @entity5 fled the scene and headed to a nightclub after punching @entity2 @entity23 , but a court heard that he handed himself into police after discovering he had died the pair spotted a man and woman having an argument and @entity100 told the woman to calm down			1
the man left but the woman then slapped @entity100 - causing @entity118 to intervene			1

' but the defendant was n’t calming down			0
he ran over the road towards @entity23 at speed and gave him a forceful punch to the face			0
' @entity12 fled as onlookers went to help the @entity2 who was unconscious and bleeding from a wound at the back of his head			1
@entity12 then went to @entity141 ’s nightclub for up to 30 minutes before friends said he left because he was ' feeling bad about what had happened earlier '			1
but the 20 - year - old still posted a tweet that appeared to boast about his actions			1
@entity12 handed himself into police at 3pm the following afternoon saying : ‘ i ’m really sorry i have hit him ’			1
my @entity99 continued : ' he said he was leaving the @entity153 pub when he saw @entity100 arguing with a male and should have left it			0

' he said he had never seen @entity23 before			0
he said @entity23 had said something to him and he admitted running off			0
he said it was spur of the moment and was really angry and not like that normally and did n’t know why he did n’t it			0
' he said he just ran over and hit him			0
he said he swung with his right hand and hit him on the head with his fist clenched , he said it was quite hard			0
he saw @entity23 drop to the flow and ran because he was scared			0
' in mitigation defence counsel @entity171 said : ' this was a single punch delivered in drunken anger at a perceived insult			0
' his remorse is apparent and repeated again and again			0
he has never sought to blame or cast any sign of the conduct on the late @entity23			0
' it is a stark lesson to young people who get drunk and aggressive how one blow can lead to a tragic loss of life			0
he would do anything to take that one punch back			0
he is a thoroughly decent young man			0
' the family of @entity23 arriving at @entity45 to witness the sentencing of @entity5 behind bars : @entity5 was only jailed for four years after the judge found he showed ' genuine remorse ' for his actions sentencing judge mr justice @entity192 told @entity12 : ' you had drunk more than was good for you and no doubt drink played its part in this crime			1
but i accept you have genuine remorse for what you have done			0
' i accept that the tweet was in retrospect most unfortunate in the morning before you realised your actions had serious consequences			2

' his family are left to grieve for him and left with constant reminders what may have been if he had survived			0
' senior investigating officer @entity209 from @entity210 said : ' this was a mindless unprovoked attack which ended in tragedy			0
it only takes one punch to kill someone and cause so much anguish			0
' @entity23 ’s parents , family and friends were all extremely proud of his achievements ; to lose a loved one in this way is totally devastating			0
whatever sentence is imposed it will not compensate for their loss			0
