@entity1 players were incensed when referee @entity2 denied them what appeared to be a stonewall penalty against @entity5 , despite having a clear view of the incident			1
as @entity10 striker @entity9 headed the ball on , @entity8 could be seen lifting his arm as the ball struck him on the way through			1
referee @entity2 was in a good position to see the incident clearly , but made the decision to refrain from awarding a spot kick			1
the ball clearly hits the arm of @entity5 defender @entity8 on the way through a different angle of the incident shows again that the ball hits @entity8 after @entity9 's header referee @entity2 ( bottom left ) has an unobstructed view of the incident between @entity1 and @entity5 after the match , speaking to @entity29 , @entity9 said of the incident : ' it was a yard ahead of me , my header was on target			1
@entity8 had his hands up and for me , it was a definite penalty			2
' @entity1 manager @entity38 added : ‘ @entity8 has lost @entity9 on the initial header and is just trying to get something in the way of the ball			1
it ’s a goal - bound header and he ’s made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down			0
‘ the referee is clearly standing there four or five yards away so why he has n’t given it i do n’t know			0
‘ it ’s a waste of time ( speaking to @entity2 about it )			0
i ’m sure he will say something like the lad could n’t get out of the way because he was so close but i do n’t think that ’s the case			0
' at the time of the incident , @entity1 were level with @entity5 , who equalised through @entity60			1
the home side had gone 1 - 0 up after just two minutes , and were looking to hold on for an invaluable point against @entity64 's men			1
they managed to keep the scores level at 1 - 1 , leaving them in 10th place ahead of the 3pm kick - offs in the @entity70			1
it was a quiet game for @entity2			0
the only real talking point was the penalty for the @entity8 handball			2
his arms were up in an unnatural position , so it should have been a penalty			0
@entity5 have certainly had a lucky @entity79 in terms of penalties awarded against them , with the @entity1 incident the clearest of three			2
@entity5 had one given against them versus @entity85 on @entity86 , but there should have been another earlier in the game at @entity89 , when @entity90 tripped @entity91			0
at @entity93 two days later , @entity92 clearly held @entity94 toward the end of the game as a corner was taken , but appeals were waved away			0
@entity64 's side are riding their luck			2
@entity94 was bundled to the floor by @entity92 but no penalty was given by @entity103 last week			0

in the 64th minute , @entity9 's header appeared to hit @entity8
referee @entity2 was well - placed , but did not give a spot kick
after the match , @entity9 told @entity29 that he thought it was a penalty
@entity1 held on for a 1 - 1 draw against @entity5 at the @entity113
@entity115 says @entity5 are ' riding their luck '
