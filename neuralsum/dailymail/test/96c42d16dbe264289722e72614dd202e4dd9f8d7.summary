‘ but it was equally effective as any , from a set piece			2
it ’s good to see , we have n’t come back from being behind much this season			2
‘ @entity0 is a presence , but he ’s more than that he ’s got good feet , he was excellent when he came on			2
he ’s very important in terms of scores like this and the situation the game was in			0
that ’s when he ’s probably going to play his biggest part			0
it ’s his job to turn those into points for us			0
’ all it took was a split second lapse in concentration from @entity3 ’s defence and they were behind in only the sixth minute			2
the first half was still taking shape when @entity55 was afforded time and space on the right inside the box to bring a cross under control with a lovely touch and pass into @entity10 to fire in first - time			1
the striker , formerly of @entity101 , was so free he looked over to the linesman , fearing he was offside , but the flag stayed down and he notched up his 19th goal of the campaign			0
@entity5 goalkeeper @entity44 was diving left , right and centre for the remainder of the game to keep his side ahead			1
twice he denied @entity31 and again a powerful effort from @entity28			0
but @entity0 was thrown on in the 79th minute and rose to meet @entity28 ’s left - hand side corner to finally beat the @entity114 keeper			1
@entity5 manager @entity62 said : ’ they put a very , very , very expensive acquisition on			1
he is pretty good in the air			0
i ’ve just watched it and @entity32 is head - to - head with him , it ’s one of those you get your head on it sometimes it flies in sometimes it does n’t			2
he ’s started to pay a bit back , i ’d say			0

@entity3 are unbeaten in seven , but no - one is able to get a grip at the top of the @entity8 table			1
‘ i ’ve not known a league change hands so much , ’ @entity42 added			0
‘ i ’ve not known it so tight			0
i said a few weeks ago there could be plenty more twists and turns			0
‘ i think everyone is hoping they can be the team which breaks away			0
with so few games to go now it looks unlikely			0
it all goes down to the team who can hold their nerve the most and who can continue to avoid the pressure of what ’s at stake			0
