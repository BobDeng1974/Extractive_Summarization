while people on @entity3 celebrated @entity4 yesterday with turkey , yams and fruit cobbler , astronauts on the @entity1 tucked into a rather more cosmic version of this festive meal			1
on the menu for the six crew members were bags of freeze - dried , irradiated and thermostabilised food that resembled their @entity15 counterparts			1
from a bag containing smoked turkey to some questionable - looking cornbread dressing , both the @entity16 and @entity18 segments of the station came together to enjoy the feast in space			2
pictured here is @entity26 astronaut @entity32 with the meal enjoyed by all six of the crew on the @entity1 in a video @entity26 astronaut @entity36 talked through the food the astronauts would be tucking in to - 260 miles ( 420km ) above @entity3			1
although they are n't given a day off , @entity26 said its crew onboard the station was given an easier day during the holiday			0
' the @entity26 astronauts on the orbital complex will have a light day on thursday for the @entity4 holiday and will share a meal with the rest of their crewmates , ' the agency said			1
- irradiated smoked turkey - thermostabilised candied yams - freeze - dried green beans - freeze - dried mushrooms - freeze - dried cornbread dressing - @entity58 cherry - blueberry cobbler while most @entity16 roasted turkeys and emptied cranberry sauce out of cans , the station crew broke out the scissors to open bags of freeze - dried , irradiated and thermostabilised food			1
their menu included traditional holiday fare with a space - food flair - irradiated smoked turkey , thermostabilised candied yams and freeze - dried green beans and mushrooms			1
the meal also featured @entity26 's own freeze - dried cornbread dressing - just add water			1
dessert featured thermostabilised cherry - blueberry cobbler			0
the space station @entity79 crew is made up of commander @entity81 and flight engineer @entity82 of @entity26 , flight engineers @entity83 , @entity85 and @entity86 of @entity18 's @entity87 and @entity89 flight engineer @entity88 of @entity90			2
station food generally resembles that , for the most part , flown in space since the inception of the @entity95 some 30 years ago			0
the astronauts ' menu included traditional holiday fare with a space - food flair - irradiated smoked turkey , thermostabilised candied yams and freeze - dried green beans and mushrooms astronauts on the @entity1 often enjoy meals together at breakfast , lunch and dinner			1
pictured here are most of the crew of the previous @entity111 enjoying a meal with each other @entity26 has been researching and developing ways to extend the shelf - life of food needed for deep space missions , such as those to @entity119 , and to minimise the volume of packaging			1
the agency is also using the @entity1 as a laboratory to learn how to grow plants , such as lettuce , in space			2
future crew members spending @entity4 in space may have one traditional staple : fresh sweet potatoes			1
the sweet potato may be one of the crops chosen for crews to grow on deep space missions			0
it provides an important energy source - carbohydrates - as well as beta - carotene , a source of vitamin a. commander @entity81 ' @entity32 of @entity26 is seen here explaining the menu , while holding a sachet of irradiated turkey			2
although they are n't given a day off , @entity26 said its crew onboard the station was given an easier day to celebrate the holiday @entity4 has been a traditional staple of life on the @entity1 for many years			1
here @entity18 cosmonauts @entity151 ( left ) and @entity152 celebrate @entity4 aboard the @entity1 in 2005 the sweet potato is able to adapt to a controlled environment with artificial sunlight , and it is highly adaptable to a variety of vine - training architectures			2
the main shoot tip , or the end of the main vine , is the only really sensitive part			0
it sends hormones throughout the plant that stimulate root development , which is important since it is the roots that become the sweet potatoes			0
the side shoots , if picked when young , are tender and can be eaten in salads , improving the plant 's usefulness			0
scientists believe most food items in the transit food system on future deep space missions will resemble those used on the station			0
advanced processing and packaging methods will be needed to provide extended shelf lives and improved nutrition for the longer missions			0
stored food and salad crops will be used in the early stages of planetary stays until permanent living bases are constructed			0
food on the @entity1 today , although still not able to match that enjoyed on @entity3 , has improved greatly from the early days of spaceflight in the 1960s			0
where once astronauts were limited to tubes of pasted food , now they at least have foods that you would find back on @entity3 ( shown )			0

@entity26 in @entity27 revealed the @entity4 meal enjoyed on the @entity1
astronauts ate freeze - dried , irradiated and thermostabilised foods
@entity26 has developed its own cornbread dressing which just requires water
space agency reveals plans to grow sweet potatoes on future missions
all six crew members will eat the special menu *tomorrow*
