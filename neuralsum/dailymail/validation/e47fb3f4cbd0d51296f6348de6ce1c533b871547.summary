forget the bragging rights - victory in sunday 's @entity1 vs @entity3 clash could be worth as much as £ 70million			1
while nothing will be decided in the latest installment of the old rivalry , at 3.20pm we will be a lot closer to knowing who will be in pole position to land a treasured place in the top four and the @entity14 qualification that brings			2
the victors can look forward to a £ 70m cash bonanza from appearing on @entity18 's biggest stage thanks to the tv money and gate receipts that brings			1
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 come face to face in a huge clash at @entity25 on sunday after @entity3 's disappointing 2013 - 14 season , they will be desperate to break into the top four this time around @entity1 are two points behind @entity3 in the league , and desperate to topple their rivals group participation : £ 6.3million win bonus : £ 720,000 draw : £ 362,000 qualification to round of 16 : £ 2.54m quarter - finals : £ 2.83m semi-finals : £ 3.55m winners : £ 7.61m runners - up : £ 4.71m gate receipts per match ( @entity3 ) : £ 2m gate receipts per match ( @entity1 ) : £ 1.5m ( numbers based on 2013/14 figures ) the losers , however , may be advised to find out what number @entity46 is on their tv boxes and brace themselves for the prospect of a fraction of that sum from the @entity52			1
in the packed stands it will all be about what happens on the pitch			0
in the directors box , however , officials will no doubt be calculating the rewards of glorious victory and the cost of miserable defeat			0
should @entity21 's visitors triumph in the early kick - off they will stretch the gap on @entity1 to five points with eight matches to play			2
victory for @entity22 's resurgent @entity69 would see them take over fourth spot by a point			0
a draw and the advantage remains with the visitors from the other end of the @entity76			0
while officials from both clubs are desperate to make the @entity14 , failure to do so would do more damage to the @entity82 coffers			1
there has been plenty at stake in previous matches , but @entity14 money is now bigger than ever @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 celebrate during a @entity3 vs @entity1 clash in 1997 - 98 @entity1 are two points behind @entity3 going into sunday 's huge game at @entity25 @entity3 , perennial participants , are already counting the cost of this year 's non-participation			1
figures recently released reveal that they are set to see a drop in revenue of around £ 50m as a result of their inability to qualify under @entity102			2
should they repeat the trick this year that figure will rise to around £ 70m thanks to the new tv deal with @entity108 which is worth an extra £ 20m			0
then there is @entity3 's £ 750m kit deal with adidas			1
that features a £ 22.5m penalty should they fail to qualify for the @entity14 for two consecutive seasons			2
if the unthinkable happens , the loss would hit a staggering £ 100m			0
@entity102 ' failure to reach the top four last season has made success imperative this time around @entity1 got a taste of the @entity14 this season , and will want the same again in 2015 - 16 the impact another year without @entity14 football would have on existing and potential sponsors can not be quantified but it could run into the millions			1
@entity3 have a vast commercial operation with offices in @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 aimed at squeezing every penny out of their global brand			0
while they could label one year without @entity14 football as a one - off , investors may see two years of non-qualification as more of a trend			0
that logic would no doubt spread to the @entity139 where failure to qualify could have an impact on the club 's share price			0
@entity3 are used to @entity145 success , and will want to recreate nights like this - @entity147 in may 2008 much of their success came under sir @entity149 ( centre ) , and they have struggled since his retirement in 2013 - 14 , when @entity3 were knocked out by @entity152 in the quarter finals , they picked up £ 31.3m in broadcasting money alone			1
as for prize money , @entity18 pay around £ 800,000 for each win and £ 415,000 for a draw			0
there is also the extra gate receipts , although this would be offset by an appearance in the @entity52			1
season ticket holders at @entity3 commit to buying tickets for @entity145 matches and they would be looking to pick up around £ 2m per game			2
sunday 's match is set to be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries around the world @entity170 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) left @entity3 for @entity171 all of the above would help both clubs when it comes to complying with @entity175 regulations			1
however , the latest , staggering £ 5bn tv deal for @entity179 tv rights is a game changer			1
@entity3 privately believe that could give them the clout to finally overtake @entity171 and end the talent drain that saw @entity170 and @entity89 depart @entity82 for the @entity184			0
there is not only @entity14 cash up for grabs			2
@entity188 ( second left ) speaks to his players during a training session at the club 's @entity192 training ground @entity3 's first team were readying themselves for sunday 's match in training on friday morning at the end of the season the @entity179 dishes out ' merit ' money based on finishing position			1
last year the difference between @entity203 , who finished fourth and @entity205 , who finished fifth , was £ 1.24m			0
@entity1 and @entity3 are seemingly out of the title race			2
this is not a battle for honours but the match is set to be the most - viewed of the season			0
it will be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries with the global fanbase enjoyed by both a major factor			1
there is much more than three points at stake , but then there always has been .			0

sunday 's clash will go a long way to deciding the @entity179 top four
thanks to tv money and gate receipts , reaching the @entity14 places will earn the victors a £ 70million cash bonanza
failure to reach the top four would damage @entity3 's coffers more than it would @entity1 , after their failure under @entity102 too
the match will be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries
