by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 18:02 est , 11 october 2012 every dog has its day … and one brave @entity2 is being hailed a hero after risking life and all four limbs to rescue two other furry buddies stranded on a runaway canoe			0
astonishing footage of the dog diving into a fast - flowing river , and then dragging the canoe with his pals back to the safety of the shore , has been posted on @entity16 and is already attracting a healthy following			1
the dog in front is barking from the boat but , while its tail is wagging , it is clear that the situation is becoming increasingly distressing			1
seemingly responding to the dog ’s woof for help , our hero bounds into the water and swims towards the drifting canoe			0
his owner and a friend encourage the dog , @entity27 , to ' keep going , boy ' and ' bring him home ' , as the @entity2 furiously paddles against the current			1
strength and ingenuity : the clever lab manages to find the rope attached to the canoe and drag the boat and two yapping dogs back to shore where 's the thank you ? once they reach the riverbank , the two stranded dogs jump off and run away well done ! @entity27 shakes himself off and soaks his owner as the man gives him a well - deserved pat eventually , @entity27 manages to find the rope attached to the canoe and begins an extraordinary tug - o - war as he drags it back to shore			1
despite his life - saving efforts , the other two dogs leap from the canoe without a word of thanks when they get close enough to the shore and disappear off camera			2
thankfully , the hero dog ’s owner is on hand to give him a good pat. some @entity16 users described the footage as ' incredible ' , but others criticised the humans , asking why they let the dog risk being washed away while they themselves did nothing to help			0
the most satisfying part of the drama has to be the moment right at the very end of the clip , when @entity27 vigorously shakes himself dry and gives his owner a soaking			2
