the brave and quick thinking efforts of the two police officers who saved a woman just seconds from drowning in her car after it plunged into a harbour have humbly insisted their heroic act wa all just part of the job			1
incredible images show officers @entity10 and @entity12 rescuing the petrified 63 - year - old woman from the car , which was rapidly sinking into @entity15 in @entity16 at 3pm on tuesday			1
@entity10 modestly described the dramatic rescue as ' pretty much part of a routine job being a police officer ' , saying the whole rescue only took about 40 seconds - and that 40 seconds later the car completely vanished beneath the water			1
the courageous officers received a call from @entity26 police commissioner @entity25 on tuesday afternoon to commend them on their efforts			1
@entity12 told the commissioner , ' it 's just another day on the job , sir ' , stuff.co.nz reported			0
the terrified woman , who is yet to be identified , was squashed up against the rear window as the front end of the @entity55 was rapidly nosediving into the harbour the officers and a bystander could n't open the car doors so @entity12 attempted to break the driver window with a spanner that he found on the ocean floor when he cut his left hand			1
' when we entered the water , i was talking to one of the ( members of the public ) who was trying to balance the vehicle and he said he was looking for a rock to try and smash the window , ' @entity12 told the @entity72			2
he said once his spanner failed his fellow officer @entity10 successfully smashed through the rear window with a rock - by which time the car was sinking at an alarming rate			1
' at that time the car actually started to move very fast into the water			0
i was trying to hold the car , slowing it down from entering the water , ' @entity12 said			0
the officers then managed to pull the woman from the car to safety , but said they got her out just in time			2
' it was pretty close , probably 30 or 40 seconds after we managed to get the female out of the car , the car was already slipping further into the water , ' @entity10 said			1
' i 'd say she 'd probably only had maximum probably another minute , minute - and - a - half if she had n't got out , ' he said			0
the car was fully submerged less than a minute after the woman was freed from it			0
the sunken @entity55 is frightening proof that the woman would not have made it without the help of the quick - thinking policemen the woman is lucky to be alive after the terrifying accident where her car careered into the harbour a tow truck starts to pull the car from the bottom of @entity15 in @entity16 as a police officer watches on detective sergeant @entity100 said police were still trying to work out how the bizarre incident occurred			1
he said the woman , who was in shock , got away with just a ' few cuts and bruises and is lucky to be alive , ' stuff.co.nz reported			0
@entity108 was fishing as he saw the @entity55 go straight into the water after driving over the @entity112 's car park rock wall , and he immediately went into the water to attempt to smash the window			2
' the two police officers smashed the back windscreen , i tried to smash the sides and they did n't want to break			0
we were running out of time because the vehicle was filling up , ' he said			0
another witness saw the car was ' filling up fast ' and said the officers get to the woman ' just in the nick of time			2
' the woman is now in hospital in a stable condition and is expected to make a full recovery .			0
