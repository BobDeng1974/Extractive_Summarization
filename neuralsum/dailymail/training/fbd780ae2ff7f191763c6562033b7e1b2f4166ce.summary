the mammal was spotted having a blast at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , an area of the @entity14 popular with the species			1
it was spotted by keen photographer @entity17 , who said she takes pictures of seals because of their happy nature			1
roaring with laughter : the happy seal seems to have been tickled by something as it rolls onto its side too much : the expressive mammal is overcome with the giggles is rolls around on the rock raising a smile : the seal cracks an almost human smile as he seems to enjoy basking in the sun the jovial beast , which @entity17 nicknamed ' lol ' was more than happy to play up for the camera			1
harbour seals come in a variety of colours , and all have dog - like heads without external ears			2
this breed of seal particularly enjoy basking in the sun at low tides			2
@entity17 , from @entity46 in @entity13 , said : ' when i saw what he was doing my first thought to the seal was ' please do n't stop , i have to get a shot of this '			1
' i like to think he was mugging for the camera or maybe he was laughing at me			0
he probably thinks humans are silly			0
@entity57 and easy : @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 is a favourite spot for the harbour seals who love bask in the warm sunlight smiling from ear to ear : the jovial seal does n't seem to mind at all when it eventually realises it 's being pictured ' initially i could n't believe i had captured the moment but as i clicked through my shots i realised that i had actually captured several moments			1
it is extremely fun to see them play			0
they always bring a smile to my face and i ca n't stop photographing them			0
' they are just cute and silly			0
i am truly blessed to live in an area with such diverse sea creatures			0

the happy seal seemed tickled with laughter as it lay about on a rock
