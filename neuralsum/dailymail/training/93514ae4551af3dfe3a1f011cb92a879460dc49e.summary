no one wants to be nabbed by the police			2
but a ride in a state - of - the - art £ 170,000 @entity2 must surely soften the blow			1
it is a small luxury @entity8 's criminals will have to get used to , as the latest addition to the emirates police fleet will be tough to outrun at 207mph			1
it can reach 207mph , weighs the same as a small @entity25 , and has triple the power of a @entity28 police patrol car the @entity15 motor joins a garage of the world 's most expensive patrol cars including a @entity33 , an @entity34 , a @entity35 , a @entity36 , and a @entity37			1
they can all exceed 190mph			0
the latest add - on , built in @entity39 , has a twin - turbocharged 3.8 - litre engine that generates three times the power of the @entity28 panda car			1
and complete with flashing lights , it can accelerate from 0mph to 62mph in 3.1 seconds			0
designed by @entity47 , creator of the @entity48 and award - winning @entity49 , it is the first @entity2 built since the @entity50 was discontinued in 1998			2
try getting away from this : one of the @entity8 police force 's super vehicles , a £ 1.6million @entity34 one - 77 raw power : the @entity55 , right , and @entity56 , left , outside one of @entity8 's police stations it is made with carbon fibre for minimum weight - just 1,306kg , well below the average of 1,500 - 1,700kg			1
in november , it won ' @entity21 ' and ' @entity64 ' at the @entity22			1
the custom - made vehicle , painted in @entity8 's flagship green and white colours , carries a ' 2020 ' number plate to celebrate the nation 's successful @entity69 bid , which will showcase business , creative , and economic innovation in the country to millions of visitors			1
the luxurious cars are part of a government - outlined @entity77 , released earlier this year , which ruled top - of - the - range cars are a necessity to fight crime in a city with so many highways			1
speeding drivers are even known to plead policemen to detain them and escort them to the station in their cutting - edge vehicle			2
officers will take a compulsory driving course then get their pick of the fleet			0
arrest me : speeders have asked to be detained in the new cars , including this @entity95 supercar : this year , @entity97 added a white and green £ 294,665 @entity56 to their patrol fleet among others , they can choose a limited - edition @entity56 - released this year to celebrate the firm 's 50th anniversary - to scale the opulent city			1
last year @entity97 took on 50 @entity104 and 35 were marked as patrol cars by the force			1
@entity107 , 25 , drives one of the 217mph @entity56 police cars			1
he said : ' i have issued about 30 tickets to drivers blocking the traffic and parking in prohibited places			0
' but the most amazing thing about driving such a car is how people look at you with a big smile			2
' deaths on the road are a common occurrence in the @entity124 , with one person killed in a traffic incident every 26 hours			0
purpose : cars like this @entity129 could help bring down the number of road deaths action : the cars were brought in to clamp down on speeding , with one person killed in a crash every 26 hours most of these deaths are caused by speeding , driving without a seatbelt and driving while using mobile phones			2
the police recently announced anyone caught exceeding 125mph would face legal action and it is hoped the presence of 700bhp supercars will make boy racers think twice			2
following the arrival of the supercars , some motorists are thought to have actually asked to be arrested in the hope they can be taken back to the local nick in a @entity36			0
@entity150 , who personally owns a @entity151 , patrols the streets in a @entity55 she said : ' it is the first time i have driven a sports car			0
when they chose me i could n't believe it			0
driving it is just amazing			0
' it 's funny because we hear people begging us to arrest them for any reason so they can have a tour in the @entity36			0
' i miss the car when i 'm off duty			0
my @entity151 does not compare			0

state - of - the - art patrol car three times more powerful than @entity28 police cars
