better for passengers to be clear			0
' her sentiments were echoed by @entity121 user @entity120 ' , who asked @entity22 in a message at 10.51pm : ' why when the strike finished at 9pm are there still tube stations closed ? ' a @entity22 spokesman had said on @entity121 last night just before 8pm : ' strike is scheduled to end around 9pm but services will still be disrupted			1
please do n't leave it too late to travel			0
' ‘ there are some interesting ideas in @entity22 's plans and modernisation is needed , but @entity134 should be given the chance to have their say and improve them			0

keeping order : a police officer helps commuters to board buses at @entity85 during the strike piling on : commuters board a limited - service @entity198 train at victoria station crowds : commuters wait to board a @entity40 line tube train at @entity80 during strikes mr @entity28 said : ‘ i understand how frustrating this has been for many @entity134 and i 'd like to thank them for their patience and stoicism during this completely unnecessary strike			2

' @entity230 is not short of money and does not have to ape the government 's politically motivated pay policies that have fuelled the longest decline in wages on record			0
' ‘ i am grateful to the @entity1 staff who rejected this pointless action and worked , and to the hundreds of volunteers who are helping passengers through the day			0
‘ i 'm pleased that having failed repeatedly to engage in constructive talks around @entity22 's modernisation plans , the unions have agreed to sit down with @entity22 at @entity244			2
‘ rather than hurting hard - working @entity134 and hard - pressed small businesses , they should have been talking to @entity22 this week			0
that the unions wo n't negotiate until after the strike is over tomorrow says a lot about their failure to engage			2
‘ if , as they claimed yesterday , mr @entity151 and mr @entity155 are happy to embrace modernisation , new technology and change , then what on earth are they doing on strike when these changes do just that and involve no compulsory redundancies ? ’			2
