it may look like a work of art at first glance , but this is the amazing image that reveals the past 170 of hurricanes around the globe			1
produced by the @entity10 @entity9 , it reveals exactly where in the world is worst hit			1
the image charts 11,967 tropical cyclones that have occurred on @entity16 since the @entity9 began keeping a record in 1842 , when data was supplied by ships and lighthouses rather than today ’s advanced satellite detection systems			2
interactive map : using the map on the right hand - side , zoom in on a particular location or zoom out to see a global view			0
you can then click on the ' @entity28 ' or ' @entity30 ' tabs on the top right to view the frequency and path of all hurricanes in that particular area			2
the key on the top right corresponds to hurricane strength and the number of hits in that area since 1842			0
‘ before the advent of the satellite era , hurricane tracks were constructed from ship reports – and although reliable , some storms were probably missed , the @entity9 admits			0
‘ geostationary satellites , such as @entity9 ’s goes , revolutionised the ability of meteorologists to track cyclones , ’ the map - makers explain			2
‘ not a single storm is missed as these eyes in the sky provide consistent scans of the globe every few minutes			0
’ the group has also released an interactive map that allows you to zoom in on specific areas in the world and view hurricanes based on their frequency and path in the area			2
the team used colours to make patterns in the storms more obvious			0
by colouring how many times any storm track overlapped another , patterns arose in the density of storms affecting a given area , the team found			0
last month , the @entity10 @entity9 charted the 11,967 tropical cyclones that have occurred on @entity16 since records began			1
by colouring how many times any storm track overlapped another , certain patterns arise in the density of storms affecting a given area			0
@entity87 tracks overlapped the most in the @entity88 and @entity89			0
the frequency of track overlaps is much lower in the @entity92 @entity87 tracks overlapped the most in the @entity88 and @entity89 ( @entity93 ) , where typhoon season never ends since waters are always warm enough to sustain cyclone formation			1
the frequency of track overlaps is much lower in the @entity92 than in the @entity98			1
they also produced a second map showing storm intensity			0
in contrast to the first image of frequency , the @entity102 shows a much greater spread of strong storms , whereas in the @entity88 the strongest cyclones seem to group near the @entity110			1
this map shows storm intensity , providing an interesting contrast to storm frequency			1
here , the @entity102 shows a much greater spread of strong storms , whereas in the @entity88 the strongest cyclones seem to group near the @entity110			1

the image reveals the areas worst hit by hurricanes and cyclones since records began in 1842
the frequency of track overlaps is much lower in the @entity92 than in the @entity98
in contrast , an intensity map shows the @entity102 has had a much greater spread of strong storms
