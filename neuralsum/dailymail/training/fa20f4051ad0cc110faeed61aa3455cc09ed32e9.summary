@entity0 were stunned on @entity1 as @entity2 put five goals past @entity5 's defence			1
@entity7 's @entity6 rates the performances of every player at @entity10			1
@entity2 @entity11 7 solid and dependable , as ever , he had an unusually quiet night but was strong in that nervous period after @entity0 ’s second and until @entity2 ’s fifth when all at @entity10 suspected capitulation was coming			1
@entity11 can only watch as @entity13 scores @entity0 's second goal @entity15 6.5 a good performance all round – helpful in attack and decent in defence			1
@entity20 7 the stronghold of the @entity2 defence and the protagonist in most of the physical battles – confronting @entity25 and @entity26 at different times when necessary			1
@entity28 5.5 what was he thinking when he lost the ball on the hour to allow @entity13 to score ? @entity2 were totally in control up to that point and then had to endure a nervous period as famous capitulations , notably to @entity35 in 2001 , came to mind			1
@entity37 6.5 got out - run by @entity13 for the first goal – but was first to react to @entity40 ’s shot off the post to score to make in 2 - 1			2
left back @entity37 slides in to put @entity2 2 - 1 up in the first half @entity43 6 hard to mark properly as he departed after 10 minutes with a muscle pull			1
@entity45 7 growing maturity from the @entity48 - born @entity47			0
@entity2 won the key midfield battles and @entity50 was at the heart of that			1
@entity53 7 cooly - taken penalty and his pace was a worry all night for @entity0 until he came off for @entity57 on the hour			1
@entity58 7.5 set up @entity59 for the shot that led to goal no. 2 and was a nuisance to @entity0 all night			2
@entity64 8 created one goal with his shot against the post and scored another – slightly fortunately – with a deflection off @entity70			0
but ran all night and deserved his goal			0
@entity73 9 another superb performance – tireless running , two goals and a penalty won			1
he gave @entity79 a horrible evening			0
@entity73 ( right ) was in superb for for @entity2 , scoring twice in the 5 - 3 win subs @entity83 7 started slowly after replacing @entity43 but grew into a game in which @entity2 established midfield control , partly thanks to him			1
@entity57 6 provided the necessary steel in midfield when @entity2 were looking to go all wobbly			2
@entity89 6 did little wrong after replacing @entity37 at the end			0
manager @entity93 8 @entity2 finally look a little like the dynamic , pressing side he craves			2
his best game yet at @entity2			2
@entity0 @entity97 6 conceded five but did n’t have a bad game ’ was n’t truly at fault for any of the goals			2
@entity101 6 dependable if not his best night			0
but unlike colleagues , he at least put in a performance close to his normal game			0
@entity79 5 a grim evening for the @entity80 centre half – @entity73 ran him ragged			1
at least they should be team - mates soon – in the national team			0
@entity79 , here being closed down by @entity73 , did not have his best day at the office @entity70 7 the strongest of the @entity0 back four – but for almost the first time this season even his durability could not prevent them looking vulnerable			1
popped up for the consolation goal at the end			0
@entity114 5 the @entity115 best left back looked tired – despite being rested at @entity116			0
uncharacteristic errors were already creeping into his game before he gave the ball away for the second goal			0
@entity122 5.5 started well but when he was brushed aside by @entity73 for the fourth goal it looked as though the tiredness of a first @entity126 in @entity80 had got the better of him			2
@entity26 5.5 delightful on the ball , his pass for hazard for @entity0 ’s second was a delight – but shockingly lax as he allowed @entity73 to brush past him for the equalising goal			1
@entity26 ( right ) squares up to @entity2 defender @entity20 @entity133 5.5 could n’t get in the game as @entity0 fell to pieces and was eventually replaced by @entity136 @entity137 5 like @entity26 , was underwhelming when required to stop @entity73 for that equalising goal			1
his alertness won @entity0 their first goal – but he paid the price at half time for defensive lapse when @entity5 took him off @entity13 8 superb in that opening thirty minutes and his run to set up @entity25 ’s goal was a triumph of determination and skill – as was his ability to win the ball off @entity151 and exchange passes with @entity26 for the second			2
set up the third as well with his cross			0
@entity25 7 a first @entity126 period but he did n’t stop running , nor harrying and got his goal			0
when @entity0 fell apart , his influence diminished but that was hardly his responsibility @entity25 ( right ) celebrates with his @entity0 team - mates after opening the scoring subs @entity163 5.5 came off to give @entity0 more strength in midfield – but could n’t prevent @entity0 ’s being pulled apart at time @entity168 5.5 a rare appearance for the @entity171 but little impact in his 18 minutes			1
manager @entity5 6 no great tactical failings - it simply looked as if tiredness got the better of a previously solid defence			0
referee @entity179 6 despite @entity5 's complaints there were no major errors			0
the @entity184 handball was accidental and the hazard decision spot on .			0

@entity0 lost 5 - 3 to @entity2 at @entity10 on @entity1
