by @entity0 it ’s known for its surfing and long , pristine beaches but tourists have been flocking to @entity5 in @entity6 for a different reason lately : its artwork			1
sunbathers and surfers have been doing a double - take thanks to a series of impressive 3d drawings that have been appearing in the sand			2
the temporary scenes are the creation of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 who make up @entity20			0
optical illusion : a skater appears to jump over a terrifying hole in the ground that is in fact a drawing in the sand in a spin : skaters show off their skills on a second ramp on the beach the trio draw the complex designs using just a stick and a selection of rakes			1
@entity18 , from @entity37 , specialises in circular paintings covering themes such as ‘ space , the ocean , and the relationships humans have with nature ’			0
@entity19 , from @entity44 , is an accomplished sculptor and explores the human form and ocean life			0
beachy head : three faces appear to emerge from the sand			0
the artists use a stick and a selection of rakes to create the optical illusions shore thing : @entity56 say their work is ' ephemeral art where time , the communicative act , and directive intent are fundamental ' meanwhile , @entity17 creates colourful paintings , making use of contrast and light			1
the @entity66 was inspired by @entity67 and decided to take the concept to the beach on the country ’s @entity70			1
@entity17 says the practice requires few materials and has the added bonus of having very large natural ‘ canvases ’ close at hand			0
the artists regularly venture down to the same beach between @entity80 and @entity5 to experiment in the sand			1
macabre moment : tourists watch the trio draw a skull in the sand			2
the artists regularly venture down to the same beach between @entity80 and @entity5 to experiment in the sand blurring the lines : a speedboat appears to pull a man on water skis across the beach using a simple stick and a selection of rakes they can create textures , contrast and perspective to create an optical illusion			1
crowds often gather to watch the process and the group have recently started to make their work interactive by incorporating people into the scenes			0
designs have included skate ramps , circus scenes , surrealist landscapes - and even a toaster			2
beaten by the tide : the top of the trio 's ' deconstructed pyramid ' is washed away by the sea the @entity119 job : the artists have even brought a bit of @entity122 to the beach by recreating the @entity124 in the sand in one drawing , a staircase appears to climb out of the sand and continue into the sea while in another , a man appears to launch himself off a diving board into a small paddling pool below			1
and the trio bring the sea to the beach by showing a speedboat pulling a man along the sand on waterskies while a woman ' fishes ' from a pier nearby			2
but the drawings are only temporary and disappear when the tide comes in			0
@entity56 say their work is ‘ ephemeral art where time , the communicative act , and directive intent are fundamental			0
' castles in the air : a fortress appears to float off into the sky pop - up art : sunbathers balance on a piece of bread as it ' jumps ' out of a toaster the group 's biography states : ‘ the artworks provide an acute awareness of time and acts as a metaphor for the brevity of life			1
‘ as the tide rises and covers the work it is permanently erased from the beach making the art experience transitory unlike pictures hanging in a gallery for a period of time			1
' the works impermanence is also symbolic of many other aspects of daily life			0
' to see more of their artwork visit @entity180 making a splash : this diver wo n't have the watery landing he hopes for channel tunnel : a staircase appears to emerge out of the sand and exit into the sea			0
