by @entity1 reporter published : 08:54 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 07:34 est , 30 may 2013 @entity2 is reportedly ' furious ' @entity3 used photos of her in its newest catalog , just over a year after the casting director for the lingerie giant 's catwalk shows said she ' would never use [ her ]			1
' the busty 20 - year - old was apparently shocked to discover old images of her posing in the brand 's black body bra have graced the pages of the lingerie brand 's new catalog - without her permission			1
a source told the @entity18 : ' the pictures are from 2011			0
@entity2 's not currently contracted to work with @entity3 , and they did n't contact her before they used these images			1
' surprise appearance : @entity2 is ' furious ' that her photo from 2011 was used in the new @entity3 catalogue ( pictured ) , without her knowledge			2
just last year , the lingerie giant branded her look ' too obvious ' another source close to the model told @entity31 that the left a ' bad taste in her mouth '			1
the spokesperson added that miss @entity2 is not necessarily ' furious , ' over @entity3 's decision , ' she ’s just not thrilled about it , and the reason is she ’s not contracted to work with @entity3			1
' it indeed came as some surprise to see her posing for the brand , given that she was the subject of scathing comments from the @entity3 model booker , @entity46 , in a @entity48 interview early last year			1
ms @entity49 told the paper that she would never book miss @entity2 for the @entity3 catwalk show			2
' she is too obvious			0
she ’s like a page three girl			2
' she ’s like a footballer ’s wife , with the too - blond hair and the kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy			1
' ms @entity49 appears to be alone in her opinion of miss @entity2 though			0
the model , who shot to fame after landing the cover of the @entity65 in 2012 , has become the darling of the fashion set			0
career high : the model , 20 appeared on her second @entity65 cover this year in just under 18 months , she has appeared on three @entity73 covers , fronted the inaugural issue of @entity75 , and posed in photo shoots for @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
she has also attended the @entity80 and modeled in campaigns for @entity82 and @entity83			0
and she still remains in favor with @entity65 , who chose her for yet another @entity65 cover this year			0
but while miss @entity2 has never been an official @entity87 , it would seem that she did have something of a relationship with @entity3 in her teens			2
@entity91 reveals that she modeled pajamas for the brand back in 2011 , when she would have been about 18 , well before her @entity65 fame			0
a certain look : @entity3 's fashion show casting director says she ' would never use ' @entity2 but the site 's @entity97 explains that a model 's presence in the catalog does not automatically qualify her for the runway show			1
' casting for the catalog and fashion show are seen as two very different things to the fashion community , ' she said			0
' there ’s a lot of cross-over but it 's not a fully symbiotic relationship			0
' it remains unclear whether or not the image on the back of the new catalog is from the same 2011 photo shoot .			0

an image of the 20 - year - old on the back of the lingerie giant 's latest magazine *circulated* earlier this week
@entity3 's casting director said early last year that the model is ' like a page three girl ' with ' the kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy '
