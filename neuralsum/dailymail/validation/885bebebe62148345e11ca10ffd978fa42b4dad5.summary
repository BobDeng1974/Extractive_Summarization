@entity0 , the revolutionary documentary filmmaker who helped pioneer nonfiction movies by turning a keenly observant eye on both the famous and the ordinary in films like @entity6 and @entity7 , has died			1
in a statement , @entity0 ' family said the director passed away after a brief battle with cancer at his @entity14 home thursday night			1
the @entity0 - as many referred to them - chose subjects as ordinary as the struggles of @entity27 salesmen and as glamorous as @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity30 , whom the pair followed in 1964 during their first trip to the @entity35			1
one of their films , @entity6 , about @entity40 ' @entity39 concert on dec. 6 , 1969 , captured on film the killing of a fan and the darkening of the hippie dream			1
the @entity39 concert was the @entity40 ' disastrous effort to stage a festival like the @entity50 gathering a few months earlier			0
@entity0 was active right up to this death			1
his documentary of the fashion icon @entity54 , @entity54 , is to be released in april			2
earlier this week , the @entity55 announced that @entity56 , a documentary he co-directed about the longest train route in the @entity35 , will premiere at this year 's festival			2
' we lost a true titan today , one who pioneered an art form and fostered a whole generation of artists , ' said @entity67 , president of @entity68 , which is releasing @entity54			0
' his impact is immeasurable and we wo n't soon see his likes again			0
' born in @entity71 to @entity73 immigrants from @entity74 , @entity0 served in the @entity75 from 1944 to 1946 , studied at @entity76 and @entity77 and taught psychology for three years before turning to film			1
his first foray into motion pictures was a 16 - mm documentary he made in 1955 while visiting mental hospitals in the @entity83			2
maysles started out as an assistant to @entity86 , a pioneer of cinema verite , and his peers included such acclaimed documentary makers as @entity91 and @entity92			2
he and @entity91 were among those who worked with @entity86 on the groundbreaking 1960 documentary @entity94 , about rival @entity96 presidential candidates @entity97 and @entity98			2
@entity0 also served as a camera operator for @entity91 's 1968 concert film @entity100 ' my friendship with @entity103 was forged during four months of filming together , just the two of us , in @entity105 in 1959 , ' said @entity91 , referring to their film opening in @entity108 , about that year 's world fair			1
' when he got a camera against his eye , he was one of the world 's great watchers , and i knew we would always be filmmaking companions			0
' filmmakers @entity22 , left , and @entity0 work on the streets of @entity14 for @entity118 the @entity0 and others worked without scripts , sets or lighting			1
the resulting works had no narration , no filmed interviews and gave audiences a fly - on - the - wall feeling			0
' our films are n't the conventional kind , locked down and scripted before shooting begins , @entity128 once said of their films			2
' we shoot life as it 's lived			0
' a technical revolution had made such films possible — the arrival of lightweight , portable sound and film equipment — and gave them the opportunity to observe their subjects with as little effect on events as possible			2
] the natural disposition of the camera , ' @entity0 said , ' is to seek out reality			1
' in 1966 , using the new equipment , they filmed @entity151 shortly after he finished in @entity152			0
@entity151 explained that his book was his idea of the nonfiction novel - ' a synthesis of journalism with fictional technique			0
' ' we wanted to experiment in film the way @entity151 had experimented in literature , ' @entity0 said in @entity163 and @entity164 , the filmmaker 's autobiographical documentary			1
that led them to make the feature - length salesman in 1968 , following @entity27 salesmen from house to house as they try to convince people to buy what one of them calls ' still the best - seller in the world			0
' the technique of unfettered observation - ' direct cinema , ' the brothers called it - allowed the @entity0 to record such historical moments as the slaying of a fan at the @entity39 concert , and the grim reaction of @entity186 , the @entity40 ' singer , as he watched a replay of the footage			1
president @entity190 awards the 2013 @entity191 to filmmaker @entity0 in @entity7 , released in 1975 and later adapted into a @entity193 musical , the @entity0 captured on film the lives of a mother and her daughter , relatives of @entity199 , living in a falling - apart @entity201 mansion			1
some critics attacked the cinema verite techniques as falsely objective , given that the film ultimately viewed by audiences was usually a result of what the filmmakers chose to focus on and the cutting and selecting of the editing process			0
' any work of art is a combination of objective and subjective , ' @entity0 once told the @entity216 in response to those criticisms			1
' but i try to minimize my effect			0
i do n't interview people , for instance			0
if you ask a question , that determines the answer			0
making a film is n't finding the answer to a question ; it 's trying to capture life as it is			0
' after his brother died in 1987 , @entity0 continued to work with various collaborators and mentored younger filmmakers			1
in 2006 , he founded the non-profit @entity235 in @entity236			0
' while we mourn the loss of @entity0 , we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as inspiration to people around the world to be willing to push themselves creatively and take the time to observe and reflect on life as it unfolds , ' said @entity248 , executive director of the center			1
@entity0 also continued a longtime working relationship with artists @entity251 and @entity251 , whose process for creating monumental environmental art the @entity0 documented in several films beginning in the 1970s			1
they were @entity256 nominated for their 1973 short @entity257			0
in 2007 , @entity0 and @entity258 made the @entity259 about @entity251 and @entity251 's @entity261 project			2
