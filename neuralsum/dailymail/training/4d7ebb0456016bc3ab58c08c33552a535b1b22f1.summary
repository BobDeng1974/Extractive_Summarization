by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 12:20 est , 17 june 2013 golfers have the best memories of all professional sports people , a psychologist has claimed			1
a combination of their visualisation techniques and the uniqueness of each shot they play contributes to their elephantine memories , said dr @entity13			1
each shot is filed away into the memory backs to be accessed for future reference when they are faced with a similar situation			2
@entity17 tees off on the 16th tee during the fourth round of the @entity20 at @entity21			0
each shot is unique and golfers can remember them in astonishing detail , maintains a sports psychologist ‘ golfers can remember significantly more , ' compared to athletes from other sports , dr @entity13 , the director of the @entity27 in @entity28 , told the @entity32			1
golfers are helped to remember because each shot is unique , whether distance , approach , wind speed or slope			1
moreover , they get a long time to consider how to play the shot , unlike most other sports people who have to make an instant decision			1
his claims were backed up by golfers such as @entity44 , with two @entity46 and two @entity20 championships under his belt , who said : ‘ the majors , i really remember my wins			1
i really remember almost every shot			1
’ @entity17 said there are things outside golf that he struggles to remember but that it is completely different with the sport when ‘ it does n’t take me long to remember things ’			2
@entity58 , a golf pro since 2001 , put it down to the length of time golfers get to consider what to do : ‘ you ’re living in the moment for a while , as opposed to shooting a basketball			2
’ @entity44 ( left ) can remember every shot he made in his @entity20 triumphs in @entity46 and the @entity70			1
but @entity71 ( right ) disputes the idea that a good memory helps golfers - he says he plays ' much more in the present than the past ' but it ’s not all advantageous , said @entity76 , a sports psychologist from @entity77 , @entity78			2
he maintains that it is best to rely on the unconscious memory – the hindbrain – to conscious thought – the forebrain – because of the risk of performance anxiety			0
‘ think of them as two different - caliber golfers , ” he said			0
“ the hindbrain is a pro , excellent technique and timing			0
the front brain is a hacker			0
if you gave the front brain a golf club , it would n’t know what end to hold			0
’ golfer @entity97 said that under pressure golfers can quickly reveal their shortcomings : ‘ you go through so many processes in your head , you forget about one key bit of information that could have saved a shot			2
' and @entity105 , said his memory is far from perfect , which he regards as beneficial to his play : ‘ i get up in a press conference after a round , and a guy asks me what i did on 15 , and i ca n’t remember what 15 is			0
“ i just try to play the shot in front of me			0
i ’m much more in the present than the past			0

golfers remember ' significantly more ' , says dr @entity13
may be because each shot is unique , whether distance , approach , wind speed or slope
also get longer to consider each shot , unlike other sports people who have to make an instant decision
