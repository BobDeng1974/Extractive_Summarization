@entity0 booted a 78th - minute penalty to end @entity3 's long wait for a win at the home of 10 - times @entity7 champions @entity6			1
the centre 's easy kick earned the @entity3 a 22 - 19 win , their first @entity7 victory at @entity12 since 2003 , and also ended a run of 10 matches without a win in all competitions against @entity6			1
after @entity18 kicked a massive 55 - metre penalty to level the scores at 19 - 19 in the 70th minute , the match looked to be heading for a draw and a valuable two points for the @entity6 after last week 's thrashing at @entity24			1
@entity3 players celebrate their victory over the @entity6 at @entity12 but with time running out , referee @entity27 awarded a controversial penalty which was greeted by boos from the @entity12 crowd			1
@entity31 kicked 17 points in all , @entity3 's solitary try coming from prop @entity34 , while @entity35 scored for @entity6			1
@entity36 added 11 points with the boot			0
@entity31 and @entity6 number eight @entity39 both received yellow cards			0
@entity6 boss @entity42 hinted he might go into the transfer market after last week 's record 45 - 0 defeat at @entity24 , due to an injury crisis that has robbed him of almost half his 45 - man squad			1
he called on a side which again had an unfamiliar look to show some " steel and backbone " against an @entity3 side that had a shocking record at @entity12			2
with first - choice centres @entity54 and @entity55 out , @entity35 moved to outside centre , allowing winger @entity57 to make his first start of the season			0
flanker @entity60 made his first start of the season for @entity3 who had much the better of a poor first half and turned round 13 - 6 up thanks to the try by prop @entity34 and a conversion and two penalties from @entity31			0
@entity0 kicks the straight - forward penalty that won the match for the @entity71 fly - half @entity36 kicked two penalties for @entity6 but also missed two from long range			1
@entity31 put the @entity3 ahead with his first penalty in the fifth minute and five minutes later the visitors thought they had scored when @entity78 put fellow winger @entity79 over , only to see the try chalked off for obstruction by number eight @entity82			2
@entity36 missed penalties either side of a successful one for @entity31 and it took a fine tackle by @entity6 winger @entity88 to stop @entity89 scoring after the flanker had split the @entity6 defence with a fine run from halfway			0
@entity93 was lucky to escape a yellow card when he appeared to punch @entity6 flanker @entity95 during a melee , and after consulting the @entity98 the referee reversed the penalty he had given to @entity3 and warned @entity93 and both captains			2
@entity6 's @entity88 is tackled during their defeat at home to the @entity71 @entity36 finally put @entity6 on the scoreboard with a 29th - minute penalty but they failed to collect the restart , @entity78 plucking the ball out of the air and launching an attack that led to the visitors ' try			1
after @entity78 had been forced into touch just short of the line , @entity6 messed up their line - out			0
the @entity3 however won theirs through former @entity6 lock @entity114 and the forwards drove @entity34 over for an easy try , which @entity31 converted			2
@entity31 , however , played little further part in the half			0
he was yellow - carded for handling in a ruck near his own posts , allowing @entity36 to slot an easy penalty			0
@entity3 fly - half @entity124 missed a long - range penalty and centre @entity128 failed to capitalise on an interception on his own line , throwing a speculative pass into thin air just past halfway , near half - time			2
eight minutes after the break burns reduced the deficit with his third penalty			0
@entity60 embraces @entity31 after he kicks the match - winning penalty for @entity3 @entity34 wasted a chance when knocking on within sight of the @entity6 posts before @entity31 slotted another penalty to make it 16 - 9			1
@entity6 equalised minutes later when @entity35 caught the @entity3 napping , picking up at the base of a ruck and sprinting 15 metres to score while the @entity3 watched @entity146 organise his attackers			2
yet @entity31 put the @entity3 back in front again with another penalty after @entity39 had been sin - binned for dangerous play			0
@entity36 missed a long - range penalty and such was @entity6 's desperation that centre @entity18 then attempted one from five metres inside his own half - and it sailed over			1
but two minutes from time @entity36 clinched victory for @entity3 with a simple penalty after @entity160 had been penalised for handling on the floor .			0

@entity3 's @entity0 kicked penalty in the 78th minute to inflict a second successive loss on the @entity6
the result is the first time the @entity71 have won at @entity6 ' @entity12
@entity18 had kicked a *55m* penalty to level the scores at 19 - 19
the @entity6 ' loss follows their 45 - 0 *battering* by @entity24 last week
