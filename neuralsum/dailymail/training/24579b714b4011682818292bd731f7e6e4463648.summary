@entity0 had spent the best part of half an hour happily explaining why additional referees are the best way of eradicating mistakes in the penalty area when i asked him why @entity8 had not bought into his ideas			2
it is a curious situation for football at the very highest level , after all ; the fact that two extra officials will be present at @entity16 matches and at a @entity17 but are nowhere to be seen come the @entity18			0
it 's as if they are ignoring one of the finest referees football has ever seen			2
someone surely worth listening to in his role as @entity26 's refereeing chief			1
' @entity28 ? ' i asked @entity0 , my inference being that common sense has lost out to the apparent power struggle between @entity32 and @entity33 over the use of goal - line technology			0
for the first time the otherwise ebullient @entity0 fell silent			0
@entity37 gestures during @entity39 's @entity38 win against @entity40 at @entity41 @entity37 was punished after going to see popstar @entity42 ( left ) , pictured with @entity43 football is a fiercely political arena and refereeing does n't appear to be immune to the kind of nonsense that can actually hinder progress			1
there is a lack of unity , a lack of consistency , and a sense that the game is suffering as a result			0
the last week or so has been less than positive for @entity60 refereeing , and not just because two of the three finest officials in the country have been exposed for breaking professional refereeing protocol			2
@entity0 wants extra refs behind each goal @entity37 was left off the list last weekend as a result of his @entity42 concert controversy , on what proved to be a weekend when the @entity71 could have seriously done with him			1
@entity73 , it has now emerged , has also been guilty of breaking protocol this season , by giving his girlfriend a lift in an official vehicle			0
unlike @entity80 , @entity73 does not appear to have been punished			2
nobody representing the @entity82 is prepared to tell us why			0
but @entity73 was among those guilty of making some fairly high profile mistakes at the weekend and prompting the former @entity60 referees chief to launch what read like a serious attack on his successor			1
@entity91 now gives his views on the internet and his last blog would not have been well received by @entity96 chief @entity95 when it was so critical of his 17 top level referees and their working practices			1
' sadly another weekend of fixtures has witnessed our group of professional referees producing less than acceptable performances , ' wrote @entity91			1
@entity91 's damning indictment continued with a claim that @entity106 's leading referees are not fit enough and at this moment are employing ' an inconsistent approach to decision making '			1
he also demanded more of @entity110 , the former @entity18 final referee who does seem to have remained very much in the background since joining @entity95 to become the @entity96 technical director			1
the @entity96 would refute @entity91 's claims , and they would do so supported by what they would argue are hard facts			1
they could point to the results of physical tests that reveal the fitness of our professional referees has improved year on year in the five years since @entity95 took over			1
they might also wish to remind @entity91 that @entity106 is one of only three countries in @entity125 to boast three elite @entity8 referees ; namely @entity80 , @entity73 and @entity127			1
when it came to selecting a referee to take charge of what @entity26 probably suspected could be an explosive encounter between @entity133 and @entity134 , it was to the experienced @entity127 that they turned			0
last weekend 's games might not have been the finest advert for @entity60 officiating but the @entity96 could quote statistics from last season claiming clear signs of improvement			0
@entity91 has criticised the performance and fitness of @entity60 referees in his online blog @entity95 ( left ) has overseen an improvement in fitness and performances over the last five years the accuracy on major decisions – fouls , penalties , cards and so on – rose to 95 per cent last season from 94.1 per cent the previous year			1
accuracy in the penalty box has risen to 98 per cent , while offside decisions rose to 99 per cent when they stood at 92 per cent when @entity95 took charge			1
seasoned , expert observers outside the @entity96 would agree that @entity91 is probably wrong ; that fitness is not the concern			1
but they would say that @entity60 football needs more referees like @entity80 on the pitch rather than in the sin bin			2
what @entity80 does , say the experts , is put in the hard yards that might avoid some of the problems we are seeing this season , and is makes a fair bit of sense			2
@entity37 does not play it safe			1
he runs wide when it would be easier to run down the middle of the pitch – and so stay closer to the action - and he does so for one simple reason			0
because by running wide he gives himself a better angle of vision to see what is actually going on in the penalty area when a referee running just behind the players is more likely to have his view obscured ; something we saw this weekend in the case of @entity73 and @entity190 on monday night			0
@entity73 , pictured sending off @entity191 , ignored three @entity193 penalty appeals on sunday @entity37 runs wide during games to give himself the best possible view of the action as it unfolds such an approach does come with certain risks if you are being assessed and your livelihood depends on good reports backed up by statistical analysis			1
for a start a referee might struggle to argue they got it wrong – or failed to act at all - because their view was obscured			0
but @entity80 is so highly rated by his peers because he gets himself in the position to make a call			2
he did n't have the wit to flag up his desire to go to a concert when it would have been easy for the @entity96 to move him off @entity217 versus @entity218 , and that might lose him friends			0
but he 's a damn fine referee who needs to avoid getting himself left off the list			0
this might be closer to the point @entity91 is making when he complains of an inconsistent approach to decision making			2
maybe he sees referees playing it safe and not enough officials like @entity80			0
maybe he sees different methods being applied by referees working under the same leadership at @entity96			0
the @entity96 would refute that too			0
but at a time when @entity8 and @entity26 ca n't even agree on how best to referee the penalty area , raising the concern that there is an alarming lack of consistency seems perfectly reasonable .			0

@entity37 was punished after going to see an @entity42 concert
but he is among the best referees in the @entity71 and makes every effort to make the *correct* decisions
@entity91 has criticised the standard of refereeing in @entity106
chief @entity95 has overseen a rise in *standards* over the last five years
