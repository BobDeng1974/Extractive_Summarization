battle : @entity1 , 30 , is demanding her daughter @entity2 is allowed into reception class after she chose to exercise her right to hold her back a year because she would have started just after turning four a mother is fighting for her daughter to be allowed into reception class at school a year later after she decided to delay her education because she only turned four a few weeks before school started			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , was due to start primary school last september , weeks after her fourth birthday , but her parents decided to exercise their right to delay the start of her school life by 12 months			1
her mother @entity18 , 30 , believes her daughter was ' not ready for school ' , and is furious her local council is now considering sending her straight into year 1 because she was held back			1
now she is fighting to allow @entity2 to start in the reception class			1
if mrs @entity1 is successful it could help thousands of others start reception a year later too			2
@entity25 guidance brought in last year says summer - born children can wait until the september after their fifth birthday if their parents feel they need more time to develop			1
and it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be ' no barrier ' to the child then starting in reception class			1
the rule was introduced after research showed they were more likely to struggle at school , do worse in exams and have less chance of getting into university			0
but some councils are still sending youngsters straight into year 1 if their parents hold them back unless they can prove there were ' exceptional ' circumstances			1
this means the child has only six years of education instead of seven before moving to secondary school , wiping out much of the intended benefit			2
mrs @entity1 said : ' i felt @entity2 was not emotionally ready to start school just weeks after turning four			1
she 's quite sensitive and takes a long time to get used to people			0
' she was still finding it difficult to adjust to pre-school and i knew she would n't cope with the full - time hours of school - she often still needed a nap in the day			0
' when i looked into it i discovered legally she did n't need to start school until this september			2
row : mrs @entity59 says she would ' have no choice but to quit work and home school ' @entity2 if she automatically put into year 1 , robbing her of a year of education ' but now i 'm being told that she will probably have to start school at the same level as those in her chronological age - so she would skip straight to @entity69			1
' it means she will miss out on an entire academic year , which makes no sense			2
she will start already a year behind her peers , it will mean she is destined for a school career which will see her struggling and playing catch - up - exactly the situation we were trying to avoid in the first place			2
@entity25 guidance allows parents to delay their child 's schooling until the september after their fifth birthday			2
this policy , updated last apring , is designed to help children with birthdays between april 1 and august 31			0
this is because because experts believe they are more likely to struggle academically if they start school after just turning four			2
the @entity25 guidance says : ‘ an increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents , local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer - born child to start school			1
' there are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class '			1
but some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into @entity69 to ease pressure on places in reception			0
@entity119 says : ‘ if you choose for your child not to start until their statutory school age ... starting in a reception class following a child ’s fifth birthday is only possible in exceptional circumstances			1
’ @entity128 warns : ‘ you will need to apply for a place in @entity69			0
‘ however , the school may then be full because the places have been allocated to children in the previous school year			1
’ ' we have been asked for evidence of special educational or psychological needs , but she does n't have any			0
' there is no way i will let her start in year 1 , i will have no choice but to quit work and home school her			1
' there is growing evidence that children born late in the academic year who start school at four are already at a disadvantage just 12 months later			1
a 2009 @entity25 report found that only 40 per cent of children born in summer were achieving a good level of development compared with 50 per cent among those born in @entity158 and 64 per cent in @entity160 babies			0
those born in september were also almost twice as likely to achieve good grades as those in august			0
of the lowest 20 per cent of achievers , 49 per cent were born in @entity165 months			0
last spring ministers sent guidance to schools and councils that could end the anguish of parents whose children are forced to start formal education at barely four			1
the @entity25 guidance says : ‘ in recent months , an increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents , local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer - born child to start school			1
’ the advice , drawn up with help from parents , adds : ‘ there are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class			1
’ campaign group @entity194 is lobbying ministers for clearer legislation , claiming many councils are not complying with the guidance			0
campaign leader @entity199 said she had received a ' flurry ' of complaints from parents who want to delay their children starting school but have claimed they are being forced to apply for a school - or they would forfeit a place in reception all together			1
the news comes as the debate surrounding the legal age children should start school is set to go before the government 's @entity210 next month			2
a spokesman for @entity213 said the decision about @entity2 's future will now be decided by the school			2
coun @entity216 , cabinet member for learning , added : ' we are working with the school and @entity2 's mum in order to get the best outcome for her and any admissions decision will take into account the latest @entity25 guidance plus information provided by @entity227 in support of her application			2
' summer - born babies tend to perform worse in exams and are more likely get bullied by their classmates , research has found			0
many experts believe that the attainment gap between children born just after the academic year starts in september and those born during the summer holidays is already evident by the age of five and , while it narrows as pupils progress , it fails to close			0
a 2009 @entity25 report found that only 40 per cent of children born in summer were achieving a good level of development compared with 50 per cent among those born in @entity158 and 64 per cent in @entity160 babies			0
those born in september were also almost twice as likely to achieve good grades as those in august			0
of the lowest 20 per cent of achievers , 49 per cent were born in @entity165 months			0
previous @entity211 research has said that at gcse level , 10,000 teenagers fail to score five good grades every year simply because they are the youngest in the academic year			0
this compares to 90,000 for autumn - born pupils			0
in 2009 only 47 per cent of pupils born in august obtained five or more gcses at @entity258 compared with 55 per cent of those born in september			0
another study carried out by the @entity261 found 12.5 % of august - born pupils were assessed as having mild special educational needs by age 11 , compared with only 7.1 % of those born in september			0
experts have argued over whether they should start school as soon as possible , with their september - born peers , wait several months or even be held back a year			1
@entity25 figures show 62 per cent of those born between may and august fail to meet minimum expected levels in areas such as reading , writing , speaking , maths and listening .			0

@entity10 only turned 4 a few weeks before the start of the school year
her parents decided she was not ready for school emotionally or *physically*
they followed new guidance that says daughter can start a year later
@entity211 says : ' no barriers to admitting child of five to reception class '
but council has said @entity2 she must go straight in to year 1 instead
the ruling means the four - year - old will miss a whole year of school
*250,000* other children may also be forced to miss a year of schooling
