@entity0 has launched a damning critique of @entity3 ’s transfer strategy at @entity4 , claiming that his compatriot has badly mis - judged the nature of @entity8 football by signing mainly attacking players			1
former @entity11 manager and @entity12 has previously been a supporter of @entity3 , notbaly duirng the @entity13 when he backed the manager ’s tactics for the @entity17 national team when @entity3 was under attack from the likes of @entity20			2
but @entity0 is perplexed by the signings of @entity22 at @entity4 , with the likes of @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 coming in for £ 170million even though @entity4 have neglected to sign central defenders			1
@entity3 has had a rough start at @entity4 and is suffering a defensive crisis @entity0 says @entity22 made big errors in the transfer window and does n't understand @entity36 football and the former @entity38 player thinks that @entity3 has put too much faith in the attacking insticts of @entity42 football , failing to understand the @entity8			1
@entity0 said : ‘ how on earth is it possible that such an experienced and successful manager thought he could start the season at @entity4 without buying a couple of really strong central defenders ? ‘ i am still amazed by his buying and his transfers			1
if you only strengthen the midfield and the attack , than you are underestimating the level and the power of the @entity8			1
if you want to survive in the top flight of @entity36 football you start with the foundation and you build the roof of your house last			2
@entity22 has done it the other way round			1
‘ after the departure of @entity65 to @entity66 , and @entity67 to @entity63 it was obvious that new central defenders were needed			0
and he had 200 million in his chequebook to spend			0
if you do n’t use part of that to buy strong , experienced central defenders you have the wrong idea about the @entity8			1
@entity22 has managed the likes of @entity76 and @entity77 but this may be his toughest task @entity0 says he wants his countryman to be successful but it will take at least three months to sort things ‘ now matters are even worse because of all the injuries in his defence			1
he is having to fill one gap after another			0
and if you have so many injuries and you have not bought the defenders , than you are doing something wrong at your club			0
’ and @entity0 , writing in his @entity42 newspaper column in @entity93 , claimed that by the time @entity22 has realised his mistake and fixed the team , it will be too late			1
‘ i do want him to be succesful at @entity4 , but by the time he has repaired his team at the back , it will another three months down the road			2
@entity67 and @entity65 both left @entity4 in the summer and have not been replaced ‘ i feel that his transfer policy at @entity4 and his choice to buy only midfielders and attackers is down to his @entity42 background			1
in @entity17 he grew up only thinking about attacking football			0
‘ @entity22 is learning lessons right now			2
he sees that his defenders are having to deal with the strongest strikers in the world			0
they bash into his young defenders			0
in @entity36 there are different laws in football			0
at @entity76 he has become one of the best defenders in the world			0
at @entity4 he could not get a look in			2
’ @entity120 and @entity25 joined up with the @entity121 despite defence being a bigger issue			0

@entity0 has critiqued his countryman ***'s*** start at @entity4
in his @entity93 column @entity0 says he is amazed by @entity4 ***'s*** transfers
@entity0 says @entity4 ***'s*** defensive weakness was obvious and that their new manager has ' the wrong idea about the @entity8 '
the @entity42 says it will be too late once @entity22 realises his mistake
