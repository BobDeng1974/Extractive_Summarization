a father was just ' seconds from death ' after a bite from a false widow spider triggered a heart attack			2
@entity5 , from @entity6 , was bitten three times on the shoulder by the spider - while his four - year - old son was on his lap. the 28 - year - old said he stopped breathing as the pain ripped through his body and he went into cardiac arrest after the attack at his parents ' house			1
at one point during his seizure the father - of - one was convulsing so badly he had to be tied to a bed for his own safety , the @entity19 reports			1
after he was rushed to hospital , he spent 24 hours in intensive care while medics battled to save him			1
he said : ' i have never felt pain like it			2
i pulled off my shirt and saw the spider getting stuck in			2
' i ripped it off my shoulder and its fangs tore a lump of my skin away with it			1
' at one point during his seizure the father - of - one was convulsing so badly he had to be tied to a bed for his own safety he said the pain ripped through his body , making him feel like he was on fire before he fell unconscious			1
mr @entity5 said he woke up in intensive care but was later told he had been injected with adrenaline to doctors tried to restart his heart			1
at one point mr @entity5 was hooked up to seven drips in an attempt to flush the venom from his system			1
he said : ' the doctors said i â€™d have died if i was alone when i was bitten			1
' i was once knocked down by a car and i got up after it hit me but this thing laid me out			2
' they 've inspired terror into millions , sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped			0
so what are false widow spiders ? much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow , which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children , ill or elderly people			0
although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow ( above ) is not known to have caused any deaths in @entity75			1
by comparison , around four @entity75 each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction			1
false widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			1
millions of false widows , @entity75 's most venomous spider , are found across the @entity75 and the population is growing			0
also known by its @entity92 name @entity91 , its first @entity75 sighting was in @entity93 , @entity94 , in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern @entity95			0
but the @entity96 says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north , a theory backed by wildlife sightings			0

as @entity75 's most venomous spider species , false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs			2
an entire secondary school was shut in october last year in the @entity117 , @entity118 , after an outbreak of the arachnids in its @entity122 block had to be fumigated			2
in the worst cases , suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later			0
but many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled			0
there have been no reported deaths from the spiders in @entity75 , where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the @entity135 in the 1870s			0
it is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected , rather than being linked to the spider 's venom itself .			0
