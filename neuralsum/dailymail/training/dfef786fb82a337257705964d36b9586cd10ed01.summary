by @entity0 strangers from across the country have raised more than $ 48,000 to keep a student at @entity4 after her mother committed suicide and her father lost his job			1
@entity9 , 19 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was left $ 24,000 short for the upcoming school year - despite a summer job , savings , a scholarship , a student loan and financial aid from the school			1
so last week , out of desperation , she created a @entity20 page to try to raise $ 25,000 to ensure she could return to the college for her second year			1
after just three days , it had raised more than $ 6,000 and now it has topped $ 48,000 as nearly 1,000 people from across the country donate amounts between $ 5 and $ 100			0
determined : @entity9 launched a fundraiser to help her pay for her second year at @entity4			2
she struggled after her mother committed suicide last year and her father lost his job this year ' there are really no words to say how thankful i am , ' she told today			2
' when i saw $ 5 donations , i knew that was from people who did n't have the money to give , but they gave anyway			0
' some of the donors have said they were also affected by suicide , while others are people she knows or @entity4 alumni wishing her well			0
on the page , @entity9 explains that her mother , @entity43 , had residential custody of her when she graduated from high school			2
her mother was unemployed and her financial aid at @entity4 was determined by her income			1
a year at the @entity49 university , including tuition , fees , accommodation , books and other expenses , can reach more than $ 62,000 a year			0
missed : her mother , @entity55 , took her life last year after struggling with the death of her son five years prior but just three weeks before the teen headed to college , her mother killed herself			1
@entity9 explained to today that her mother had struggled with her brother 's death from an overdose five years prior			1
' it was a difficult year , but i did my best to persevere , ' @entity9 wrote on her fundraising page			2
but after her freshman year , she lived with her father in @entity70 and he took on residential custody of her , so her financial aid was based on his 2013 income			1
then earlier this year , he lost his job			2
with the financial aid already based upon his previous earnings , @entity9 learned that she was about $ 24,000 short for the year			1
so she turned to the fundraising website to ensure she could continue studying towards her biomedical engineering degree			0
kindness of strangers : more than 1,000 people have raised more than $ 48,000 for the teenager with the donations already far exceeding her target , she said she will put the extra money towards paying for her junior and senior years			0
she plans on leaving the fundraiser up until school starts on august 20			0
' it is overwhelming , but in a good way , ' she told @entity94			0
' it was just so touching , and i 'm so grateful and i was so blown away by it all			0

@entity9 was left $ 24,000 short for her second year despite a summer job , a scholarship , a student loan and financial aid
so she launched a @entity20 page in the hope she would be able to raise some money to help but within days , the amount surpassed her goal
her mother , @entity55 , took her life three weeks before @entity9 's freshman year after struggling with the overdose death of her son five years earlier
