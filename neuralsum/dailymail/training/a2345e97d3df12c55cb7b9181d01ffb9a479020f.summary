for hundreds of years the @entity3 dominated large parts of the @entity5 until , mysteriously in the 8th and 9th century @entity6 , a large chunk of the @entity2 civilisation collapsed			1
the reason for this collapse has been hotly debated , but now scientists say they might have an answer - an intense drought that lasted a century			1
studies of sediments in the @entity14 in @entity15 suggest a lack of rains caused the disintegration of the @entity2 civilisation , and a second dry spell forced them to relocate elsewhere			1
research co-authored by dr @entity22 from @entity23 in @entity24 provides new evidence for the drought theory of the @entity2 collapse			1
the research suggests that a sharp decline of the @entity3 around 900 ad was due to a drought - while a second coincided with the fall of @entity32 ( shown ) in 1000 ad the theory that a drought led to a decline of the @entity36 is not entirely new , but the new study co-authored by dr @entity22 from @entity23 in @entity24 provides fresh evidence for the claims			1
the @entity36 refers to the time from 300 to 900 ad in @entity41 - a region that extends from central @entity43 to @entity15 , @entity44 and northern @entity45			1
during this time the @entity3 built a number of monuments , on which they recorded dates			0
in 514 they were building around ten per year , rising to about 40 per year in 750			0
but following this , the numbers began to decline quickly ; by 900 , no monuments were being built			0
dozens of theories have attempted to explain the @entity54 , from epidemic diseases to foreign invasion			0
this latest theory , though , adds fuel to the idea that climate change was the reason			0
previous research has found that periods of high and increasing rainfall coincided with a rise in population and political centres between ad 300 and 660			2
professor @entity68 , from @entity69 , and his research team collected a stalagmite from a cave in @entity15 , less than one mile ( 1.6km ) from the @entity74 site of @entity75 in @entity15 and about 18 miles ( 29km ) from three other important centers			2
using oxygen isotope dating in 0.004 - inch ( 0.1mm ) increments along the length of the stalagmite , the scientists uncovered a physical record of rainfall over the past 2,000 years			0
combined , the stalagmite and hieroglyphs allowed the researchers to link precipitation to politics			0
they say a climate reversal and drying trend between 660 and 1000 @entity6 triggered political competition , increased warfare , overall sociopolitical instability , and finally , political collapse - known as the @entity54			0
this was followed by an extended drought between ad 1020 and 1100 that likely corresponded with crop failures , death , famine , migration and , ultimately , the collapse of the @entity74 population			2
the reason for the @entity54 in 900 @entity6 has been hotly debated			1
but the evidence from the @entity14 in @entity15 ( shown ) suggests less rain led to famines and civil unrest			1
sediements at the bottom of the 407ft ( 124m ) deep hole provide a geological record of the past dr @entity22 ’s research involved drilling cores from sediments in the @entity14 , a vast circular sinkhole off the coast of @entity15 that is 984 feet ( 300m ) across and 407ft ( 124m ) deep			1
the hole formed tens of thousands of years ago when sea levels were much lower , being filled as the oceans began to rise			0
ongoing sedimentation at the base of the hole allows scientists to study periods from history			0
when there are storms or extremely wet periods , more sediments are deposited at the bottom of the lagoon			0
but less rainfall can also be accounted for , in particular due to the ratio of titanium to aluminium in cores taken from the sediment			0
a lower ratio of titanium to aluminium corresponds to dryer periods			0
‘ it ’s like a big bucket			0
it ’s a sediment trap , ’ dr @entity22 told @entity142			1
the @entity36 refers to the time from 300 to 900 ad in @entity41 - a region that extends from central @entity43 to @entity15 , @entity44 and northern @entity45			1
following the drought , the @entity3 relocated to parts of the northern @entity150 ( shown ) with his team he found that from 800 to 1000 ad , no more than two tropical cyclones occurred every two decades , when usually there were up to six			1
this suggests major droughts occurred in these years , possibly leading to famines and unrest among the @entity2 people			2
and they also found that a second drought hit from 1000 to 1100 ad , corresponding to the time that the @entity2 city of @entity32 collapsed			1
the research adds to previous evidence that suggested decreased rainfall coincided with a decline of @entity2 culture			2
and it may help finally solve the mystery of why the @entity3 disappeared in parts of @entity41 a thousand years ago .			2

research co-authored by dr @entity22 from @entity23 in @entity24 provides new evidence for the drought theory
around 900 ad the @entity3 experienced a sharp decline in @entity15
they were forced to relocate from parts of the @entity150
the reason for this collapse has been hotly debated
but the evidence from the @entity14 in @entity15 suggests less rain led to famines and civil unrest
a second drought also coincided with the fall of @entity32 in 1000 ad
