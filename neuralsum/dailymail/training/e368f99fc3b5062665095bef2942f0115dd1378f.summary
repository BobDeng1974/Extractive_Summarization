commuters in chancellor @entity12 ’s constituency of @entity13 in @entity14 will be among the hardest hit , along with travellers in @entity19 ’s @entity18 seat			2
but the cap will be of little comfort to @entity25 customers facing ‘ stealth ’ rises from today			1
the increases come as the @entity5 forces @entity25 to introduce evening peak ticket restrictions on local services			1
this is to plug the gap caused by the cost to the taxpayer of the @entity40 franchise saga in 2012			1
from today , off - peak tickets will no longer be valid on some trains between 4.01pm and 6.29pm on weekdays , which means sharp increases in some fares			0
