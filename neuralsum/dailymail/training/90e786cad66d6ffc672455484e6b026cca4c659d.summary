a star system containing two potentially habitable @entity2 - like planets is being targeted by scientists searching for extra-terrestrial intelligence			1
in the coming months , astronomers will turn an array of radio telescope dishes towards @entity8 , a star smaller and dimmer than the @entity10 about 1,000 light years away in the constellation @entity12			1
a pair of so - called ' super-earths ' have been detected within the ' habitable zone ' of the star , the orbital region where temperatures are just warm enough to allow bodies of surface water such as oceans and lakes			1
@entity24 's @entity23 launched in 2009 with the purpose of hunting for @entity2 - like planets			1
it discovered a planetary system last april featuring @entity2 - size planets in a ' habitable zone			1
' @entity31 , pictured right on this illustration , is 1.4 times the size of @entity2 , while kepler - 62e , pictured bottom left , is estimated to be 1.6 times larger @entity24 â€™s @entity23 mission has discovered two new planetary systems that include three super-earth - size planets in the ' habitable zone , ' the range of distance from a star where the surface temperature of an orbiting planet might be suitable for liquid water			1
the @entity8 system has five planets ; 62b , 62c , 62d , 62e and 62f			0
the kepler - 69 system has two planets ; 69b and 69c			2
kepler - 62e , 62f and 69c are the super-earth - size planets			2
two of the planets , named @entity23 - 62e and @entity31 , are rocky or made mostly of ice , and are believed to be the most likely to be @entity2 ' doubles '			1
although no - one knows what the planets are made of , they are believed to be rocky			1
one , @entity31 , is thought to have a radius about 1.4 times greater than the @entity2 's			1
the other , @entity33 , is estimated to be 1.6 times larger			2
the planets ' parent star is around two billion years older than the @entity10 , raising the possibility of intelligent life more advanced than it is on @entity2			1
both will be priority targets in a new @entity67 ( @entity67 ) programme focusing on habitable zone worlds			1
they were discovered by @entity24 's kepler space telescope , which has so far detected almost 3,000 candidate planets outside the @entity71			1
a fifth of these are believed to be ' super-earths ' between 1.25 and twice the size of the @entity2			0
scientists at the @entity77 in the @entity78 are listening in for radio signals from the stars that display signs of technology and intelligence			0
the search is being conducted from the @entity86 , a collection of small six - metre wide dishes in the @entity89 of northern @entity90			0
the array , launched in 2007 with 42 dishes , will ultimately comprise 350 receivers operating round the clock			0
' our surveys improve on previous , generally narrow band @entity67 by covering the radio frequency range where @entity2 's atmosphere is most transparent , including many frequencies never before observed , ' said dr @entity100 , director of the @entity101			0
' we expect to complete a meaningful survey of these stars in less than one year			0
be sure to check back soon			0
' dr @entity104 , a member of the @entity106 team based at @entity24 's @entity107 in @entity90 , whose @entity8 data is reported in the journal @entity110 , said : " these discoveries move us farther down the road to discovering planets similar to @entity2			1
' while we do n't know if kepler - 62e and f are rocky or whether they have liquid water pooling on their surfaces , their existence shows that the incidence of small worlds in the habitable zone of @entity10 - like stars is high			1
@entity8 and the @entity71 : the diagram compares the planets of the inner solar system to @entity8 , a five - planet system about 1,200 light years from @entity2 in the constellation @entity12 discovered last april			2
until now , these were the closest planets to @entity2 , in terms of size ' thus we can look forward to the discovery and detailed characterisation of @entity2 's cousins in the years and decades to come by future missions and telescopes			1
' the research suggests that both planets are solid and likely to have mostly dry rocky surfaces or be ocean - covered water worlds			1
three other planets close to the size of the @entity2 are also thought to be orbiting @entity23 - 62 , but not in the habitable @entity146 planets found around a distant star have been described as the most similar to @entity2 yet discovered			1
the planets in the newly found @entity8 system are made of rock and ice , and researchers believe they could contain water			1
kepler - 62e and kepler - 62d are among five new planets found within the ' habitable ' zone of a @entity10 - like star			1
signs of life ? @entity23 - 62f , a super-earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun , located about 1,200 light - years from @entity2 in the constellation @entity12			1
@entity31 orbits its host star every 267 days and is roughly 40 percent larger than @entity2			2
the artist 's concept depicts @entity168 , a super-earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a star like our sun , located about 2,700 light - years from @entity2 in the constellation @entity173			1
kepler - 69c is 70 percent larger than the size of @entity2 , and is the smallest yet found to orbit in the habitable zone of a sun - like star artist 's concept of kepler - 62e , located about 1,200 light years from @entity2 in the constellation @entity12			1
@entity33 orbits its host star every 122 days and is roughly 60 percent larger than @entity2 in size			2
scientists do not know if @entity33 is a waterworld or if it has a solid surface announcing the discovery physicist professor @entity186 said : ' from what we can tell , from their radius and orbital period , these are the most similar objects to @entity2 that we have found yet			2
' they were identified by data from the @entity23 mission launched in 2009 to identify extrasolar planets			2
it has so far resulted in several dozen of some 3,000 ' @entity200 ' having been studied in detail but of those the ' five - planet system ' is the most important			0
@entity186 noticed a faint dot near @entity8 a year ago , leading to months of detailed study to confirm the planet interpretation			0
the discovery was made by astrophysicists at the @entity208			2
the findings were published in @entity210			0
researchers use fluctuations in the brightness of a star to identify the presence of a potential planet whose transit periodically dims the light of the star			0
@entity186 uses large ground - based telescopes to image the host star and analyzes the system to make sure other astronomical phenomena , such as nearby eclipsing binary stars , are not causing the fluctuation , a common ' false positive ' encountered in the research			2
' what really helped is that this star has five planets , ' he said			2
' you can mimic one planet with another event , but when you have five of them and they 're all periodic , that helps to put the nail in the coffin			0
' it 's hard to make that kind of signature with anything else that you can dream up			0
' the kepler space observatory , named after the 17th century @entity247 astronomer @entity246 , was launched on 7 march 2009 to survey a portion of the @entity249 for @entity2 - size planets that could harbour life			2
the research team used data from @entity24 's kepler space telescope , which simultaneously and continuously measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes			1
when a planet candidate transits , or passes , in front of the star from the spacecraft 's vantage point , a percentage of light from the star is blocked			0
this causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet 's size relative to its star			0
the size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet 's size accurately			0
to learn more about the properties of the stars , scientists examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface of the star			0
they probe the interior structure of stars just as geologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure of @entity2			0
the science is called asteroseismology			0
the sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface			0
the waves cause oscillations that @entity23 observes as a rapid flickering of the star 's brightness			1
like bells in a steeple , small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones			0
the barely discernible , high - frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure			0
this is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun.			0

discovery of five new planets made by @entity24 's @entity23 telescope
two of the planets , @entity33 and @entity31 , are rocky or mostly ice
all five are within the ' habitable ' zone of a @entity10 - like star
