@entity0 called for @entity2 's players to show maturity , nous and respect after @entity7 's future came under question			1
this weekend brings with it arguably @entity2 ' biggest match of the season , with the visit of @entity13 likely to be key in the fight for @entity16 qualification			1
@entity18 's first return to @entity19 's adds extra spice to a match , ahead of which his successor felt the need to hold a team meeting to refocus his players ' minds			2
@entity0 says his @entity2 players must remain focused on @entity16 qualification @entity0 spoke to @entity7 and his other players to refocus them on the last five league games @entity7 's claims that @entity33 were interested in his services were the catalyst and , while defending the 23 - year - old by saying the story was ' bull * * * * ' , @entity0 called for his players to show more common sense			1
' you know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players , ' the @entity2 boss said			1
' i do n't like to say every time it 's true or it 's not true			0
' it 's important that everybody knows his position in the club			0
they have contracts - you ca n't talk about moving because you have a contract			0
that 's not respectful to the club			0
' we spoke about that , that we need that focus			2
if we do n't have really that focus , we ca n't bring the level what we normally bring this season			2
' such speculation about the likes of @entity7 , @entity71 and @entity72 brings back memories of last summer 's talent drain from @entity19 's			1
@entity7 's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at a move to @entity33 @entity0 has repeatedly insisted a similar situation will not arise this time around , although he is wise enough to know the south - coast club 's place in the food chain			1
' on one side it 's normal because , okay , we are @entity2 , ' @entity0 said			1
' we are not @entity87 , because they are always talking about new players , and normally in teams like @entity2 , a little bit more down , they are talking about interest in players of @entity2			1
' we know that , but it 's up to the press			0
they can write and they can say what they want , but no problem			0
' we have to keep that spirit together and that was my message to the players			2
' we ca n't do anything about that			0
you have to look out if they ask you that kind of questions			0
there has also been speculation about the futures of @entity117 ( left ) and @entity71 @entity2 come up against former boss @entity18 on saturday in the race for the @entity119 ' you 're not a young kid			1
you have to respond , and if you respond you have to know what you respond			0
' @entity0 says he will not be enforcing a media ban to keep his players out of trouble - something he accepts is more difficult now given the power held by agents			1
the former @entity129 international also understands the ambitions his players may well harbour , admitting he spoke out of turn a few times when he was younger			0
' of course , when i played in @entity129 , okay , i was looking to play in a bigger team - that 's normal , ' @entity0 said			2
' if you are not really in the highest level and you get opportunities to play in a higher level , okay , you like it , of course			0
' everybody likes to play @entity145 football - that 's normal			1
i 'm not surprised about that			0
