bizarre and brilliant cosmetic treatments were big news in 2013 with the vampire facial , which involves drawing the patient ’s own blood and then injecting it back into the face , topping the most requested list			2
the facial , made famous by fans @entity8 and supermodel @entity10 , saw an 800 per cent increase last year and it seems that surgeons ca n't get enough of the bloody treatment			1
so popular and effective has it become that cosmetic doctors are using the technique on patient 's hair to help stimulate growth			2
it is a potential form of treatment for men or women who suffer with hair loss either through genetic predisposition , hormonal issues , trauma or alopecia			0
so how does it work ? the treatment , which takes around an hour and a half , involves taking four syringes of the patient ’s blood and putting it in a centrifuge ( a rotating piece of medical equipment ) to separate the plasma from the red blood cells - this is the same technique as @entity32 for the face			1
local anaesthetic injections are then injected into the scalp , which will ensure the area is numb			0
how does it work ? named @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , it is being used on the scalp as it can stimulate dormant hair follicles and encourage them to start growing again			1
this shows a 31 - year - old patient before , right , and after , left , one treatment effective : it takes around an hour and a half and involves taking four syringes of the patient 's blood and putting it in a rotating piece of medical equipment to separate the plasma from the red blood cells ; it costs £ 1,300 the scalp is then stimulated with a dermaroller			1
once the syringes are ready , the @entity32 is injected into the scalp - primarily in the areas of concern			2
the patient then has to use the dermaroller every day for around a month at home following the treatment			0
absolute aesthetics clinical director @entity86 , who recently completed her training and has just started offering the treatment , said : ' it is quite common not to see any changes for six weeks and then you should start to feel the hair becoming thicker in the treated areas			0
homecare : the patient , pictured is a 40 - year - old , is given a dermaroller to use on their head every day for around a month at home following the treatment ' the optimum results can be seen at three months			0
at this stage it is decided whether a second treatment is required or not			0
' this treatment can be used as a standalone treatment or alongside a hair transplant procedure ( usually one month pre-procedure )			0
it is not widely available in the @entity111 yet but @entity86 believes it will be big news			0
you 'll have to start saving though because a single treatment will set you back £ 1,300			1
dr @entity115 , @entity116 at 111 @entity117 , said : ' @entity32 to treat hair loss has been championed by many surgeons quietly for the past few years , and studies underway are showing promising results that the procedure does stimulate the growth of new hair follicles			1
' patients should keep in mind that @entity32 is not be considered as alternative to a hair transplant , in fact the two procedures combined provide optimum results for thinning hair			2
' the role of @entity32 in hair restoration is to stimulate inactive or newly implanted hair follicles into an active growth phase , and this treatment should be repeated ( number of treatments will vary per case ) during the re growth stage following the hair transplant			1
