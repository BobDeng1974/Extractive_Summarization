@entity0 made a late swoop to bring in @entity2 on loan from @entity4 just before the transfer window slammed shut			1
the former @entity7 striker will give @entity8 another impressive attacking option , but can he find a way to play him alongside star men @entity12 and @entity13 ? we asked out three wise men - @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 - where @entity2 will fit in this season			1
his movement and ability to hold up the ball is phenomenal			0
anyone who can keep @entity31 out of the @entity7 team must be special			0
as long as he 's fit after his cruciate - ligament injury , he will rip this league apart			2
he 's athletic , has spring and can finish with subtlety or smash the ball into the top corner			0
@entity13 and @entity12 might not be happy — @entity2 's @entity0 's no 1 now			1
if @entity39 plays 3 - 5 - 2 , there will be so many unhappy players : where do @entity41 and @entity42 fit in ? one thing is for sure — they have to get into the top four now they 've spent all that money			1
no 1 : @entity48 columnist @entity18 believes @entity2 will be first choice striker under @entity8 options : @entity0 manager @entity39 could play @entity12 wide or behind his front two versatile : @entity12 , pictured in action against @entity52 , looks likely to move from his role as a central striker @entity16 : we used to love small strikers like @entity58 or @entity59 , but now it is all about the men who can lead the line on their own			1
@entity2 is one of them , a forward with real presence who will score goals			0
ever since his superb performance for @entity7 against @entity69 in the @entity70 two seasons ago , i thought he would move to one of @entity74 's giants			0
it was a waste playing in the @entity77 league because a player of that quality needs to be somewhere better			0
i can see @entity12 dropping back and taking @entity41 's place in behind @entity2 and @entity13			1
but it will be tough for @entity0 to rotate players and give everyone game time as they have no @entity74 games or even the @entity86			2
not that @entity8 will be afraid to drop people			0
battle : @entity41 ( right ) faces a fight to retain his place in behind @entity0 's two - man strike force rotation : @entity13 could find himself out wide in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 or on the bench in @entity39 goes 3 - 5 - 2 fighting fit : @entity94 insists he is ready to lead the line for his former @entity97 boss @entity39 @entity17 : he attacks things in the box and loves getting across the face of defenders			1
maybe we 'll now see @entity0 put more crosses into the box for their out - and - out no 9			2
@entity94 takes the corners and free - kicks , @entity2 attacks them			2
he made his league debut at 13 and has been banging in goals ever since - he 's a natural born finisher			0
you could play @entity2 up top and a three behind of @entity112 , @entity94 and @entity12 with @entity113 and @entity114 sitting deep when everyone is fit			2
like our dedicated @entity0 facebook page			0
getting forward : @entity119 record signing @entity120 can play in central midfield or further up the pitch trusted : @entity39 ( right ) has the option of playing new signing @entity124 ( left ) in defence or midfield @entity128 needs time to settle - @entity39			1

@entity2 *joined* @entity0 on loan on transfer *deadline* *day*
the striker joins @entity12 and @entity13 at @entity134
manager @entity8 has opted for a 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 formation so far this season
@entity12 could play in a no 10 role to allow @entity2 to play as a central striker
the @entity141 could also change his *system* to fit his new players
@entity145 , @entity124 , @entity120 and @entity146 among signings
