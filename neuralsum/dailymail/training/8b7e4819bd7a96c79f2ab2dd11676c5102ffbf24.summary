former painter and decorator @entity10 , 24 , and his new wife @entity13 , 23 , a former @entity47 supermarket supervisor , were described as ' lucky people with bad taste '			1
after winning the euromillions in february 2012 , the newlyweds , who were living in a £ 89,950 ex-council house in @entity52 , @entity15 , announced they would spend some of the money on a ' dream home '			1
within seven months , the @entity56 had bought a 1930s mansion in @entity14 , @entity28 , for £ 1.2million - which they now plan to demolish to make way for their new home , a £ 5million eight bedroom eco-home named ' @entity30 '			1
proposals for the house , which were lodged with the local authority on thursday , outline how the property will boast a sound - proof cinema , a botanical garden and a swimming pool			1
euromillions winners @entity10 and @entity13 plan an eight - bedroom mansion with waterfall - screened garage and grotto swimming pool @entity40 described the home as being ' very out of character for the area ' and looking like ' a collection of turtles ' @entity80 , the @entity82 - based architects behind the design , have described the property as a ' 21st century country house and hidden retreat ' the home will include four wings or ' hubs ' covered in solar panels , a dramatic sweeping staircase inside , and a garage with space for 10 cars			1

mr @entity101 is also said to have bought a @entity102 and an @entity103 to replace the @entity104 107 the couple used to share			1
the cars will be hidden by a waterfall of rainwater , which will flow from one pool at the centre of the mansion to a second pool below			2
the home , said to be fit for a @entity115 villain , will also back onto the grounds of a stunning country house which appeared as ' @entity37 ' in the latest @entity39 film @entity38			2
@entity80 , the @entity82 - based architects behind the design , have described the property as a ' 21st century country house and hidden retreat ' which is ' ultra-low in energy use but also high in aesthetic aspiration and quality '			2
lottery winners @entity101 and @entity128 have planned to create a home which neighbours are disgusted by after winning the euromillions in february 2012 , the newlyweds announced they would spend some of the money on a ' dream home ' but locals in the exclusive neighbourhood of @entity14 , @entity28 , said it looked ' tasteless ' and ' disgusting '			2

it looks like a collection of turtles			0
it is very out of character for the area			0
' it is very unusual			0
with all that money they could have designed something far prettier			0
i have n't met them , or seen them at all since they moved in			0
they are lucky people with bad taste			1
' another neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ' it might be an eco-home and good for the environment but it looks pretty disgusting to me			0
' it certainly is n't my cup of tea , and i think that would go for most people around here too			0
' a @entity180 spokesman confirmed that an application had been received to demolish the @entity56 ' current home and build a new property on the site			2
he said its fate would be decided in july , adding : ' planning officials have not had time to scrutinize the plans in detail but preliminary discussions have already taken place			0
