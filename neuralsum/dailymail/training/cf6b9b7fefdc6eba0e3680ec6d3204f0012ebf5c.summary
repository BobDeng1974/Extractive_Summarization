he said : ' we are working towards building the best squad possible before the transfer window shuts and it 's positive that people ( from the club ) are travelling ( in order to sign players ) but it 's important that we only communicate official deals			0
' when we have reached one , we will announce it			0
' when asked about @entity9 , @entity5 added : ' there is nothing new to report			2
we will announce deals when they are done			0
right now , we have two @entity62 in our squad			0
