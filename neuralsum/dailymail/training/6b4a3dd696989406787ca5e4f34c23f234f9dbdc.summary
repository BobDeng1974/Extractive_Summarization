the formation that @entity1 started with against @entity2 — three central defenders and two wing backs — is a hard enough system for seasoned professionals to get right , let alone a group of youngsters , including a few making their debuts at @entity10			1
i ’ve always felt it demands too much of the wing backs , who have to cover so much ground			1
if their positioning is not spot on , then the central defenders have to react and cover the danger , but this can result in your team shape being dragged from side to side			0
and that ’s exactly what happened to @entity26 on saturday			1
@entity42 , playing as a wing back , dropped to full back , which meant he was marking @entity44 ( 1 )			1
@entity45 should have moved across to act as the full back , leaving @entity42 to deal with @entity2 right back @entity47			1
instead , @entity48 and @entity49 were forced to press @entity47 ( 2 )			2
@entity45 got too tight to @entity50 but @entity51 and @entity52 needed to move across to cover			0
they did n’t and they left @entity2 acres of room to run into ( 3 )			2
jubilation : @entity2 players celebrate going ahead in the second - half in front of their travelling fans down : how @entity26 conceded their first goal against @entity2 on saturday at @entity10 by the time the ball reached @entity50 , the @entity26 midfield , who should have been protecting the defence , were nowhere to be seen			1
with the defenders also out of position , @entity65 was left free to fire home from the edge of the area			0
three points : @entity50 wheels away in celebration after scoring the match - winner out of position : @entity26 were all over the place for @entity2 's second goal on saturday give @entity78 credit : he saw there were problems and changed to four at the back at half - time			1
but they were still all over the place for the second goal			0
@entity45 was naive in the extreme to give the ball away with his team - mates out of position			0
@entity91 sprang down the left and @entity51 went to cover , with @entity52 moving inside			0
the @entity26 pair should be adept at switching positions but they made a mess of it			2
@entity51 did not do enough to stop the cross ( 1 ) while @entity52 over-covered and got too close to him ( 2 )			2
he should be worrying about what ’s coming into the box			0
when the cross beat @entity42 at the back post ( 3 ) , and was passed to @entity50 , he was free to score with @entity52 out of position .			0

@entity1 started with three centre backs and two wing backs
the system is hard for seasoned professionals , let alone youngsters
@entity26 lost their opening @entity114 game 2 - 1 against @entity2
