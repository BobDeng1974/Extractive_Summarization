he 's the humongous snake who , in the words of his catcher , should sign himself up for @entity5			1
a @entity7 animal controller yesterday captured the fattest red belly black snake he had ever seen , after he was discovered lurking under an air conditioning unit at a business park in @entity12			1
' he needs like , @entity5 , or something , ' @entity13 told @entity15			1
it took mr @entity13 ten minutes to coax the venomous snake out from its adopted home at the @entity26 building			1
the snake weighed slightly less than 10kg and was around two metres long			2
it 's rare for the serpents to grow this long and the snake catcher has never seen one of that weight			2
' i 've got pythons here and he 's bigger than them , ' said mr @entity13 , a senior reptile technician at @entity7 and @entity38			2
even a bird of prey would struggle with a reptile of this size , mr @entity13 said			2
he said the red belly would have feasted on frogs , mice , and no doubt , other snakes too			1
' a hundred per cent ( sure ) , ' he said			0
' they 're cannibalistic , they 'll eat whatever they can fit in their mouth			0

it provoked a frightful response on their @entity64 page			0
' you 'd wan na hope there 's a toilet in that bathroom after walking in to see that - it 'd be needed lol , ' @entity75 said			1
