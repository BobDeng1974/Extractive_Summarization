@entity1 , 49 , fractured a vertebrae when he ' landed on his bottom ' after careering down a 10 - foot pole at @entity15 's assault course , in @entity16 , near @entity17 , in august 2009			2
he was taken to hospital by helicopter after the accident on the @entity22 obstacle at the @entity24 course			0
despite major surgery , his work as a taxi driver and as a carer for his seriously disabled wife have been seriously curbed by his devastating injury			1
mr @entity1 , of @entity31 , near @entity32 , @entity33 - who described himself as a ' fat taxi driver ' , unfit and weighing in at 13 - and - a - half stone - said he had been worried about the pole descent but relied on a ' highly confident ' instructor who reassured him			2
mrs @entity39 rejected claims that mr @entity1 was the ' author of his own misfortune ' and described as ' entirely fanciful ' claims that he had released his handhold on the pole whilst showing off in front of his troop			0
she found that the 24 - year - old instructor had failed to demonstrate how to safely descend the pole in the wet conditions or to instruct mr @entity1 in the correct technique before he hit the deck and immediately experienced agony			1
more than 300,000 are estimated to have used the assault course at @entity15 in @entity16 , near @entity17 mr @entity1 earlier said the instructor told him : ' just go out and give the pole a big hug , hug it tight			1
' the activity area of @entity15 was designed with help of an army instructor he added : ' i then said that i was n't very fit , that i was a fat taxi driver at 13 - and - a - half stone , and are you sure about this ? she said to just give it a big hug			0
' describing mr @entity1 as a ' thoroughly genuine and honest individual ' who had done his best to give an accurate account of events leading up to the accident , the judge said of the instructor , by contrast , ' i did not find her an impressive witness '			0
@entity76 , trading as @entity15 , was ordered to pay mr @entity1 , £ 167,514 damages , including £ 25,000 for mr @entity1 's ' pain , suffering and loss of amenity ' and additional sums for his lost earnings and the extra assistance he will need due to his permanent injury			0
the judge said she had no doubt that mr @entity1 ' is a genuine hard - working man ' who had devoted himself to the care of his wife , who was confined to a wheelchair by a childhood condition , and their four - year - old son			1
lawyers for mr @entity76 , a chartered structural engineer , had told the court that he had devised the assault course with the help of an army instructor and that , since it opened more than 20 years ago , it had been used by 300,000 people , half of them children , without any similar accidents having occurred .			0

@entity1 , 49 , left unable to work or care for son and disabled wife
@entity106 , 24 , failed to give *proper* *directions* and told on how to use pole
