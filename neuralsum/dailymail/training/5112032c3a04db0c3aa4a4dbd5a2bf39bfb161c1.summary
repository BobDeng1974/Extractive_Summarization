like plenty of 40 - something @entity3 men , @entity0 spent @entity5 last year watching the test match over beers with his best mate			1
but unlike most , @entity10 's best friend is @entity12 a-lister @entity11			1
after a long day of drinking , the pair 's conversation turned to @entity0 's health – or lack thereof			1
' @entity31 did i know he 'd had a chat with my wife and she had said to him perhaps if you get the right moment you should bring that up			0
' it was a difficult discussion for the friends of 40 years but @entity0 knew that @entity11 was right			1
the 45 - year - old , who hosts @entity40 breakfast radio as part of the @entity42 , was a smoker , a drinker and he tipped the scales at over 140kg			1
for years he had tried various fad diets and weight loss pills but nothing had stuck			0
so @entity0 and @entity11 , 46 , came up with the idea to change @entity50 's lifestyle and turn it into a tv show in the process			1
' we thought we might be able to show people you can lose weight through fun and a challenge rather than just a personal trainer yelling at you , ' he said			2
@entity11 ( left circle ) and @entity50 ( right circle ) played together in the @entity62 's @entity0 , who is a breakfast radio host on @entity40 , lost 30kg in six months ' and i 'm probably more likely to keep weight off if we do it our way than just have fun			1
' they signed a contract with @entity72 , who the pair had previous worked with on the @entity76 series			1
three separate seasons followed @entity0 as he immersed himself with cricket fans in @entity79 , @entity80 and the @entity81 – all after a challenge from @entity11			1
fast forward more than six months and @entity50 has lost 30kg and is preparing to fly to the @entity83 to run in the @entity20 this sunday			1
the first episode of @entity0 : @entity85 will air next thursday november 6			1
but @entity0 , who lives with his family on @entity88 's @entity87 , says it has been a lot of effort to get this point			1
the first thing he tackled was his smoking addiction , having his last cigarette on december 31 last year			2
the second thing he had to change was his diet			0
before he started training for the marathon , his daily food intake was massive			0
' for breakfast i 'd have eggs and bacon with lots of toast , then mid-morning i 'd have either bakery food – like a couple of cakes or sausage rolls - or i 'd grab two cheeseburgers from @entity110 , ' he said			2
' then i 'd have some sort of lunch like a chicken schnitzel roll maybe with some chips			0
' in the afternoon i 'd have a finger bun when i picked up the kids from school			0
' dinner would be a normal dinner of protein with veggies and salad , then later i 'd have a cup of tea and a couple of rows of choccy			0
' but he says that is the ' old @entity0 '			1
now he has cut out sugar and processed food , and started eating more fruit and vegetables			0
he still has bacon and eggs for breakfast , but he 's swapped the toast for avocado or tomato			2
@entity50 training on the @entity141 steps in @entity88 in april , when he first started his weight loss regimen the first episode of @entity0 : @entity85 will air next thursday november 6 on @entity72 mid-morning he has a piece of fruit , followed by a chicken wrap or chicken salad for lunch			1
he has another piece of fruit in the afternoon followed by a dinner of fish or chicken with salad and veggies			0
and he 's stopped having an after dinner snack			2
@entity0 says he 's also cut down on alcohol			1
' basically i 've stopped the grog , i might have a couple of beers a week , ' he said			0
' before that the old @entity0 would have had a good filling of grog - i reckon probably one big lunch a week because of radio industry , a couple of bottles of wine and a case of beer			1
' since filming started in april , @entity50 has also committed to a five - day - a - week exercise regimen with the help of personal trainer and nutritionist @entity171			2
@entity10 and family ( from left : son @entity173 , daughter @entity175 , wife @entity176 and daughter @entity177 ) at @entity178 in july @entity50 and wife @entity176 took part in the @entity180 at @entity178 ' for the first eight weeks all i did was walk , starting at 20 minutes the first week and building up to two hours , ' he said			0
' at the end of eight weeks i started walking for four minutes , running for one , and i 'd do that for an hour			0
he slowly increased the number of minutes he was running until he could run for five minutes without needing a walking break			2
after three months of training he completed a 5km run			1
after four months he ran 10km			2
three months in he ran a half marathon			0
the whole time @entity11 has been talking to @entity50 over phone , email and @entity194 and encouraging him to push harder with his training			2
' we talk every day pretty much – it 's perfect timing as i 'm driving to work because it 's early afternoon @entity202 time , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 , pictured training on the @entity141 steps in april , will run the @entity20 this sunday ' he just fills me in on what is going on in his life , and keeps giving advice like " your kids are watching you , if you do this you 'll set such a great example			1
" ' @entity0 and @entity11 have been best friends ever since they met at @entity213 on @entity88 's @entity214 in the 1970s			1
' the first day of school i held his hand walking into the class room , ' @entity0 said			2
' he 's more like a brother to me – his mum left the family home at a reasonably young age and his dad had five kids and he needed people to look after various kids at different times			0
' @entity24 seemed to come to our place and stay for three or four months at a time			0
' since then they 've been best men at each other 's weddings , godfathers for each other 's children and @entity11 will be there when @entity50 runs the @entity20 in @entity202 this sunday			1
@entity50 will also be cheered on by his wife @entity238 and their three children - @entity173 , 14 , @entity175 , 13 and @entity177 , 11 – who have been a great source of support throughout his training			0
@entity50 ( pictured in early october ) is confident he will be able to keep up his new , healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling @entity50 has mixed feelings about the @entity20 now it is less than a week away			2
' i 'm anxious and excited – i do n't want to let anyone down , ' he said			0
' but i 'm so proud and so confident i can do it			0
' @entity50 is also confident that he will be able to keep up his new , healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling			0
' the underlying thing is i 'm moving and i 'm eating better and if you do that you 'll be feeling better , ' he said			0
' my family and my mates wo n't let me give up , and my body now rejects crappy food , it really does			0
' i 've said that in the past but i think this time i might have cracked it			0
' @entity0 : @entity263 will air on @entity264 on @entity72 from thursday november 6 at 7.30pm			1
