passengers on flight @entity1 died of oxygen starvation hours before the pilot performed a controlled ditching in the @entity6 , according to a new study into the disaster			1
analysis by a veteran air accident investigator suggests that all 239 people lost consciousness up to four hours before the @entity13 disappeared beneath the waves			0
the most likely scenario is that pilot @entity17 deliberately depressurised the cabin , thereby depriving those on board of air , the research concludes			1
those unable to grab a mask , including sleeping passengers , would have passed out within the space of a few minutes			1
the entire ' ghost plane ' - including her cabin crew whose air supply is only marginally longer , would have slipped into a coma and died shortly after from oxygen starvation			1
@entity17 , who locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit , survived long enough - either by repressurising the aircraft or from breathing his own , more extensive air supply - to evade radar and ' execute his master plan ' , researchers have concluded			1
he then performed a controlled ditching in the sea , which would explain why no debris has been found because the plane landed and sank in one piece			1
' mentally ill ' : the book claims the most likely scenario is that pilot @entity58 ( above ) deliberately depressurised the cabin then flew for another three hours before ditching into the sea the theory is the result of the first independent study into march 's disaster by the @entity66 - based air accident investigator , @entity25			1
@entity25 , the founder of @entity67 and a commercial pilot himself , arrived at the shocking conclusion after considering ' every conceivable alternative scenario '			2
however , he has not been able to provide any conclusive evidence to support his theory			0
an earlier report from the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) also concluded that passengers may have died from hypoxia			2
and @entity79 authorities previously named @entity17 as their prime suspect			1
the remarkable claims are made in the book ' @entity83 ' , the culmination of a four - month study into the incident , which @entity25 co-wrote with the @entity66 broadsheet journalist , @entity24			2
@entity25 , a qualified transport safety investigator , said : ' one of our objectives in writing this book was , in some small way , to convey the human stories of the tragedy			2
' our other , more important task was to pursue the truth about what really happened ; that is one small contribution we felt we could make to this whole , terrible affair			0
' we could never have foreseen the information we uncovered , or their implications			0
' neither could we have imagined the horrific scenario that our research suggests took place on board that fateful plane			2
' @entity25 and @entity24 's entire scenario makes for difficult reading			0
they believe that @entity17 , who they have concluded was suffering from mental illness , tricked his co-pilot @entity112 into taking a break about 40 minutes after take - off			1
after locking @entity112 out of the cockpit , @entity17 made his last broadcast to air traffic control - ' @entity118 , @entity79 370 ' - before switching off the aircraft 's air - to - ground communication links			1
alone at the controls , he took @entity1 up to 39,000 feet and de-pressurised the aircraft , giving passengers and crew less than 60 seconds of @entity125 ( @entity126 )			0
search continues : officials claim they are ' making progress ' as they continue to scour 60,000 sq km of sea for the plane			2
the orange line indicates ' high priority ' search areas ; the yellow has been searched already @entity17 could not have prevented the plane 's oxygen masks from automatically dropping down or an automated emergency announcement in @entity139			1
but @entity1 was a night flight and , with the cabin lights off , the majority of passengers would have been asleep , or close to it			2
and for 227 of the 239 passengers , @entity139 was not their first language			0
cabin crew would have tried to help those on board , but would have had to have donned their own facemasks first			0
' it would have been a frightening and confusing time throughout the cabin , ' @entity24 said			0
' by the time some of the passengers had woken up groggy , heard the commotion and looked around in confusion , it would have been too late for them			0
' those passengers who did not react within 60 seconds or less would have lapsed into unconsciousness and death would have followed within four to six minutes			2
' international effort : @entity163 's deputy prime minister @entity162 unveiled the latest search plan at a press conference in @entity166 earlier this month			0
the government has contracted a new firm to take up the search those who had found a mask would have had between 12 and 22 minutes of breathing time before blacking out			0
the cabin crew 's oxygen supply would have lasted for about 70 minutes , depending upon the height of the aircraft			1
by the time @entity1 returned to cruising altitude , everyone on board would have perished			0
@entity17 would have had three hours ' worth of oxygen - plenty enough , the authors believe , to carry out the ' final act of his performance '			1
they conclude that he set a course for the southern @entity6 and , after the fuel ran dry , glided the aircraft for a further 100 nautical miles before performing a controlled ditching on the surface of the water			0
@entity25 , a trained commercial pilot , said : ' @entity17 was a man known for his methodical , thorough nature , for his love of the technical , and probably for his ego , too			1
' this would have been his final sad act to his family and to the world : " find this one "			0

book claims pilot @entity58 deliberately depressurised cabin
oxygen masks would only have given passengers 20 minutes ' supply
authors claim @entity17 was mentally ill and locked his co-pilot out of cockpit
@entity17 ' then landed on water so plane sank in one piece with no debris '
