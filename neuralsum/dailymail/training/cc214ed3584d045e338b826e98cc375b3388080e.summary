by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 06:37 est , 11 july 2013 older people with alzheimer 's disease are less likely to develop cancer , and those with cancer are less likely to develop @entity6 ’s , scientists have discovered			1
a study of more than 200,000 people - the largest of its kind - showed the risk of an @entity6 ’s patient developing cancer was half that of an elderly person without the condition			2
they also found that having cancer made a person 35 per cent less likely to develop @entity6 ’s			2
older people with alzheimer 's disease are less likely to develop cancer , and those with cancer are less likely to develop @entity6 's it 's hoped discovering the links between the two conditions could lead to better understanding of both			1
the researchers also hope it could open the door to the development of new therapies			0
dr @entity27 said : ‘ since the number of cases of both alzheimer 's disease and cancer increase exponentially as people age , understanding the mechanisms behind this relationship may help us better develop new treatments for both diseases			0
’ his researchers looked at 204,468 @entity39 over 60 during a six - year period during which time 21,451 developed cancer and 2,832 @entity6 's			1
a total of 161 had both diseases whereas that number would have been expected to be 281 for cancer and 246 for @entity6 's when considering how often they occur in the general population			1
dr @entity27 , of the @entity47 in @entity48 , said : ‘ while other studies have noted this relationship before , this is the largest study to date			0
the risk of an @entity6 's patient developing cancer is half that of an elderly person without the condition ‘ it has several strengths over previous studies , such as looking for the presence of the second disease both before and after the first disease was diagnosed			2
‘ this controls for the possibility the presence of one disease might obscure the diagnosis of other diseases because any new symptoms might be interpreted as a consequence of the already - diagnosed disease , or in the case of cancer , people might assume memory problems were a side - effect of chemotherapy			0
’ the researchers found the same result in people who died during the course of the study as well as those still living - controlling for the possibility the reduced life expectancy for the first disease would also reduce the likelihood of living to develop the second .			0

people with cancer 35 *%* less likely to get @entity6 's
findings could lead to development of new treatments
