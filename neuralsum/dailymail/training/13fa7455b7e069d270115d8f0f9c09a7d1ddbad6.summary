@entity0 may have turned forty this year but with her glowing , wrinkle - free skin , but looks younger than ever , despite managing a hectic work schedule and raising four children			2
gracing the cover of @entity8 's august edition , the mother - of - four showcased an enviable complexion - but what 's her secret ? the prolific tweeter , who seemingly has n't aged a day since she burst onto the scene with the @entity14 in the noughties , has shared two of her secret weapons via the social medium			0
what 's your secret , @entity22 ? mrs @entity0 , who has an enviably smooth complexion , has reveled a few of her favourite products @entity0 , 40 , is a huge fan of @entity26 , which is described as ' an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up cellular regeneration '			1
the luxury serum claims to boost the creation of collagen and new skin cells , as well as protect new cells from environmental aggravators			0
it is also packed with electromagnetically - neutral gold and moisture - holding molecules to support the skin 's natural cycle for younger , firmer and smoother skin			0
but what on earth is electromagnetically - neutral gold ? well , healthy skin has a well - balanced electrical charge that optimises cell function , allowing for efficient renewal and rejuvenation			0
skincare secrets : @entity0 , 40 , is a huge fan of the £ 230 @entity26 , which is described as ' an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up cellular regeneration ' , left , but also loves the more purse - friendly £ 30 @entity55 primer , right when this electrical charge is disrupted by environmental aggressors like uv radiation or free radical activity , cells no longer function at their full potential , which can result in a dull , uneven complexion and a loss of elasticity and radiance			1
the electromagnetically - neutral gold ingredient in this product promises to help stabilise and maintain the skin ’s natural electromagnetic field to promote healthy , radiant skin and also absorbs free radicals before they can induce inflammation			1
however , @entity22 's favourite serum does n't come cheap			0
the 25ml serum will set you back £ 230 - only the best for mrs @entity0 , right ? despite her love of all things luxury , the fashion designer is also a huge fan of a much cheaper product , which she uses to prime her skin			1

if her recent tweets are anything to go by , the former @entity14 has upped her health regime since hitting her landmark birthday			2
