a @entity1 judge declared a mistrial this morning in the case of a white ex-police chief charged with murder for shooting dead an unarmed black man in 2011			1
the jury in @entity8 deliberated for 12 hours before telling circuit judge @entity9 early on tuesday that they were deadlocked			1
nine of the jurors voted to convict the former cop , @entity13 , while three were not convinced of his guilt , prosecutor @entity10 said			2
@entity13 , a former @entity15 police chief , was charged after shooting 54 - year - old @entity16 three times in may 2011 as he tried to arrest him on an obstruction of justice warrant in the town hall parking lot			1
@entity10 , who argued that the warrant had been trumped up , said on tuesday that he will evaluate his case but plans to try @entity13 again			2
it is not yet clear when that will happen			0
early on tuesday , the judge declared a mistrial after the jury could not agree on his guilt ' i 'm going to take a little time , but we 're going forward , ' @entity10 said			0
defense attorney @entity35 , who maintains @entity13 is innocent , said it had been a long week			0
' we 're disappointed we did n't get a result , but i think both sides feel that way , ' @entity35 said			0
the defense said that the shooting had nothing to do with race and argued @entity13 fired in self - defense when he was caught in the door of @entity16 's moving truck as he tried to arrest him			1
during closing arguments , @entity10 said @entity13 frequently changed his story to match the evidence and was confident he would never be held responsible for killing @entity16 because he was a cop			2
@entity16 , 54 , was shot in the town hall parking lot in 2011 after trying to get away from @entity13 ' he thought he got away with it because he wears a badge			1
prove him wrong , ' @entity10 said in a passionate , hour - long argument during which he slammed the gun used in the killing on a table and had an assistant sit in the witness chair so he could carefully recreate the shooting			0
@entity10 also told jurors that @entity13 had delayed serving the arrest warrant for seven weeks in an effort to show off for his law enforcement friends			1
@entity35 said the case hinges on the three seconds in which @entity13 was trapped in the door of @entity16 's pickup as it rolled in reverse , not the seven weeks it took @entity13 to serve the warrant			1
' does he want to go home to his family ? ' @entity35 said of @entity13			0
' or does he hope the truck does n't roll over the top of him ? ' jurors had the choice between murder and voluntary manslaughter			0
murder carries 30 years to life in prison without parole			0
voluntary manslaughter carries two to 30 years in prison , and would have meant @entity16 's killing was illegal but happened in the heat of the moment			2
judge @entity9 authorized the voluntary manslaughter option monday			0
the seeds of the fatal confrontation were sown seven weeks earlier when @entity13 stopped @entity16 's daughter for a broken taillight			1
the daughter called her father and @entity16 came to the side of the road			0
sometime later , the chief secured a warrant for obstruction of justice , but waited several weeks to serve it until @entity16 came to @entity103 the day before his daughter 's trial			1
@entity13 had pulled over @entity106 ( seen in court ) during a traffic stop on march 15 , 2011 ( pictured right ) and she called her father			0
seven weeks later , @entity13 tried to arrest him for obstructing justice in the incident gunned down : @entity13 claims he shot @entity16 after he became caught in his truck door as he drove away from the town hall			1
here , captain @entity114 shows the jury a photograph of @entity16 's truck after the incident @entity10 asserted that @entity13 wanted to make a display of arresting @entity16 , when he could have instead asked for help from sheriff 's deputies			1
after @entity13 told @entity16 he was being arrested for obstruction of justice , witnesses said @entity16 left @entity13 ' office and went for his truck			1
@entity10 said @entity13 could have stepped away from the truck door , but instead stood there and fired three shots into @entity16			1
the prosecutor said several things made it clear the truck was stopped and @entity16 was trying to give up : the victim 's foot was on the brake , and three shell casings were found close together along with @entity13 ' dropped handcuffs			1
but @entity13 ' lawyer said all that mattered was that the chief feared for his life during the three seconds it took to shoot			0
he said @entity13 had no pepper spray or @entity146 and had no option but his gun			0
on the stand : prosecutor @entity10 , left , shows @entity13 the weapon he used to shoot @entity16 during @entity13 ' testimony on friday			0
@entity10 has said he intends to bring @entity152 to trial again @entity15 suspended @entity13 after the shooting and dismissed him several months later			2
the town reached a $ 400,000 wrongful death settlement with @entity16 's family			1
although @entity13 was white and @entity16 was black , race has n't been front and center of the case			2
@entity10 contends @entity13 was angry at @entity16 for just trying to show him up			2
' if i 'm wrong , find him not guilty , ' @entity10 said			0
' give him back his badge , give him back his gun and let him pull somebody else 's daughter over			0

@entity13 was accused of murder after shooting dead @entity16 while attempting to arrest him outside the @entity15 town hall in 2011
he claims he feared for his life when he became trapped in @entity16 's truck door as the man started driving away so he shot him three times
prosecutors denied this and said that @entity16 waited seven weeks to serve the arrest warrant so he could show off in front of his *colleagues*
on tuesday morning , the jury told the judge in @entity8 that they were deadlocked ; nine voted to convict the former cop while three did not
prosecutors say they intend to try @entity13 again but it is not clear when
