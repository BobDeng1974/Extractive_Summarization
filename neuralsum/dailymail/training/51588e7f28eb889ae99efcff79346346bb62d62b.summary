a new and annoying species of ant is terrorizing the @entity2 and chemicals that kill off other types of the insect are proving ineffective against it			1
the ' crazy ' ant , named for the erratic trail it leaves as it makes its way across the country , originated in @entity12 and @entity13			1
but since it was first spotted in @entity15 in 2002 , it has spread to some 21 counties in @entity17 , 20 counties in @entity19 and a few locations in @entity21 and @entity22			1
he said everything from cattle to songbirds are at risk of the tiny ants , despite them being at the bottom of the food chain			1
according to @entity51 , the chemicals that kill the more common red ant are n't effective on crazy ants so residents should call pest control if they find an infestation in their home			1
and hopefully they 'll get there before the critters attack their computer			2
the insects , bizarrely , are attracted to electrical wiring and components and in one year alone caused $ 146.5 million in damages in @entity17 , @entity51 reported			1
the devastation occurs when one ant discovers the transformer then gets electrocuted when it touches it , and ' waves its abdomen in the air ' omitting a certain scent			1
the scent lures for ants to the scene and they too are electrocuted , again sending the scent into the air to attract their friends			0
eventually , there are so many dead ants that the electric switches get stuck or the insulation fries and the system shuts down			0
@entity82 : @entity83 researcher @entity31 said the omnivorous ant , pictured , attacks and kills other species as well as monopolising food sources to the detriment of the entire ecosystem but @entity31 said the biggest problem of the ant 's invasion is that it has completely eliminated the red ant , or fire ant			1
and no one knows why			0
' perhaps the biggest deal is the displacement of the fire ant , ' @entity31 said , according to @entity51			1
' the whole ecosystem has changed around fire ants			2
things that ca n't tolerate fire ants are gone			0
many that can have flourished			0
' new things have come in			0
now we are going to go through and whack the fire ants and put something in its place that has a very different biology			0
there are going to be a lot of changes that come from that			0
' the crazy ants are most commonly found in coastal areas with warmer temperatures			0
known scientifically as ' @entity118 , ' they are also referred to as ' rasberry ' after the exterminator @entity121 who discovered them in @entity15 in 2002			1
the ' crazy ' ants do not have such a painful sting as their insect counterparts , but they are still a nuisance for homeowners			0
' crazy ' ants have been identified all the way from @entity17 to @entity21			1
researchers believe that the ants can not survive in regions that are dry or cold			0
unlike fire ants , crazy ants also do not spread as quickly			2
they can only advance approximately 200 meters per year on their own			0
the biggest factor in their spread along the @entity139 has been human transportation			2
@entity31 urges caution for residents in areas with known ' crazy ' ant populations to be mindful when they are traveling .			2

since it was first spotted in @entity15 in 2002 , it 's spread to some 21 counties in @entity17 , 20 counties in @entity19 and a few locations in @entity21 and @entity22
the omnivorous ant attacks and kills other species as well as monopolizing food sources to the detriment of the entire ecosystem
it also attacks electrical wiring , causing millions of *dollars* *worth* of damage
