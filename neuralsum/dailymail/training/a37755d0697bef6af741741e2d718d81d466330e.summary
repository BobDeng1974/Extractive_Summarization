the man commissioned by the family of @entity2 to perform a second autopsy on the body is having his credentials called into question , and many wondering if he does indeed qualify as an ' expert ' in his field			1
@entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , assisted dr. @entity12 in the autopsy of @entity2 , and briefly became a national figure , appearing on various news programs and being quoted in papers around the country after he revealed his findings			1
this even though the man is not a doctor , can not conduct an autopsy alone , and is unable to prove his claim that he is a college professor			2
case , who conducted the first autopsy of @entity2 , told @entity40 , ' he is doing forensic autopsies which may send someone to prison , and he is not a physician , much less a forensic pathologist			0
' she then added that she was ' shocked by this man and how bold he is to do what he does			0
' @entity9 claims he became interested in death as a child when his grandfather passed away , and began performing autopsies while he was still in high school			1
he received a bachelor 's degree in life sciences from @entity56 in 2003 , and he told @entity57 he was immediately accepted to medical school in the @entity59 , but his wife got pregnant and he wanted her to receive her care in the @entity62 , so he did not attend			1
he still has yet to attend medical school			0
he does claim to have master 's degree in anatomy and physiology , with clinical correlation , but was unable to verify that with an actual diploma			2
he also claims to be an adjunct professor at @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity11 , something that officials at @entity70 have denied			1
' [ @entity9 ] is not now and has never been a member of the @entity70 faculty , " according to a university spokeswoman			0
skipping out : @entity9 says he decided to not attend the medical school he was accepted to in the @entity59 as his wife ( above ) became pregnant and they wanted to have the baby in the @entity62 then , there are the alleged problems that have come up during his actual autopsies			0
in 2012 , @entity82 was hired by @entity83 , @entity84 , to conduct an autopsy on @entity86 , a man they believe may have died as the result of a brain bleed after he had told officers two days earlier that his grandson had ' knocked me the f * * * out			2
' two deputy sheriffs in @entity83 say that @entity9 presented himself as a pathologist , this even though he is not and must have a medical doctor present in order for the findings in his autopsy to be presented in a court of law			1
there was no medical doctor present during the autopsy			0
making the situation even more odd , the pathologist listed on the autopsy form , @entity107 , @entity108 , refused to comment on the case , and when @entity9 was pressed , he claimed that the autopsy was actually performed by dr. @entity112			2
dr. @entity112 said he had nothing to do with @entity86 's autopsy			0
' i see him as a fraud , ' said one of the deputies			0
the sheriffs had been hoping to charge @entity86 's grandson with manslaughter , but with no legal autopsy having been performed and no way to present the findings of a medical expert , it has now been two years since the death and they can not move forward to prosecute			2
other claims : one coroner says that @entity9 disappeared with a body he was supposed to examine , and two deputy sheriffs in @entity84 have labeled him a ' fraud ' then , there is the case of one funeral home , @entity136 , @entity137 , who hired @entity9 to perform an autopsy			1
after waiting over a week for @entity9 to come examine an unidentified body , so long that maggots had started to appear , he finally came to collect the body and perform an autopsy			1
but @entity143 , the @entity144 deputy coroner , says it has been over a year since the sutopsy , and he has no idea where the body is and has not heard from @entity9			2
parcells grew irritated when presented with @entity143 ' claim , and said the body in is his morgue in @entity71 and could be collected at any time			0
odd : another woman says @entity9 took her husband 's brain , around the time this photo of a brain appeared on his @entity159 page in another odd incident , @entity160 says she paid @entity9 to examine her husband 's brain after his death in 2011 , and @entity9 told her he would send the brain to @entity164 to be examined			1
three years later she received a report from a doctor in @entity167			0
she retained a lawyer , @entity168 , and at a deposition @entity9 handed over a brain in a bucket saying it was that of @entity174 's husband			0
she did not believe him , and @entity9 claims the brain is at his @entity71 morgue if she ever wants to come pick it up .			1

@entity9 , the man who assisted on @entity2 's second autopsy , is having his credentials called into question
he has a bachelor 's degree in life science , and said he has been interested in death since he was 12 , and started performing autopsies as a *teenager*
he claims to be a professor at @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity11 , a claim they deny
two deputy sheriffs in @entity84 say he claimed to be a doctor and performed an autopsy they now can not use
a coroner in @entity11 says that after waiting over a week to collect a body , he disappeared with it and never reported back
one woman claims he took her husband 's brain after she sent it to him to examine for signs of *dementia*
