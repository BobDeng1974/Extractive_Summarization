house speaker @entity0 seemed to nudge the @entity2 one step closer to putting those elusive ' boots on the ground ' in the @entity5 on sunday , saying that president @entity6 will ultimately have to deploy ground forces to fight @entity8 if no other country steps up to do it			1
' we have no choice , ' @entity0 said			2
they intend to kill us			0
and if we do n't destroy them first , we 're gon na pay the price			1
' general @entity16 , a legendary @entity17 military leader who was chief of the defence staff until last year , agrees			1
he said sunday that ' the only way to defeat @entity8 is to take back land they are occupying , which means a conventional military operation			1
' ' the only way to do it effectively is to use western armies , ' @entity22 told the @entity24 , ' but i understand the political resistance			0
' house speaker @entity0 told @entity28 anchor @entity27 on sunday that the @entity2 will have no choice but to deploy ground troops in the @entity5 if no other countries step up president @entity6 said sunday on @entity33 that his intelligence services had underestimated @entity8 , but insisted that @entity36 nations would ultimately band together and fight the way he does n't want to @entity6 has pursued a strategy of targeted airstrikes coupled with @entity40 on the ground in small numbers , hoping to ' degrade and ultimately destroy ' @entity8 , which styles itself as the @entity44			1
the president has also worked with @entity46 to fund a ' train and equip ' program in the hope of whipping the small @entity50 into fighting shape			2
lord @entity16 , the former @entity17 defence staff chief , said a ' conventional military operation ' will be the only way to defeat @entity8 that 's a process that military observers say could take a year and yield only 5,000 fighters at the outset			1
@entity8 can field an army of up to 31,000 , according to intelligence reports			2
@entity0 said on @entity28 's ' @entity60 ' program that ' if the goal is to destroy @entity8 , as the president says it is , i do n't believe the strategy that he outlined will accomplish that			1
' ' at the end of the day , i think it 's gon na take more than airstrikes to drive them outta there , ' he said			1
' at some point , somebody 's boots have to be on the ground			2
that 's the whole point			0
' ' and maybe we can get enough of these forces trained to get ‘ em on the battlefield , ' the speaker mused			0
' but somebody 's boots have to be there			0
' @entity22 criticized @entity6 's plan to rely on airstrikes to scatter the @entity8 army			1
' ultimately you need a land army to achieve the objectives we ’ve set ourselves , ' he said			0
' all air [ strikes ] will do is destroy elements of @entity8 ; it wo n’t achieve our strategic goal			2
' similarly , the retired general told the @entity95 on monday , paying close attention to @entity8 only in @entity97 is a counterproductive strategy			2
' you ca n't possibly defeat isis by only attacking them in @entity97 , ' he said			0
' how the hell can you win the war when most of your enemy can end up in a country you ca n’t get involved in ? ' ' even if you are successful in @entity97 , which i doubt , they will just go into @entity110 , and what will you have achieved ? they will just have tighter lines of communication			0
' @entity0 chided the president for telegraphing the shrinking size of his tactical toolbox by repeatedly pledging not to deploy @entity2 troop divisions into @entity110 or @entity97			1
' if i were the president , i probably would n't have talked about what i would n't do , ' @entity0 insisted			2
he said he would call @entity46 back into session immediately if the @entity121 proposed a new @entity122			1
@entity6 is relying on an 11 - year - old @entity122 , aimed at @entity123 , to prosecute his war against @entity8			1
' i think he does have the authority to do it , ' @entity0 said , ' but the point i 'm making is this is a proposal the @entity46 ought to consider			1
' @entity127 moves : @entity0 said that ' if i were the president , i probably would n't have talked about what i would n't do ' ' the president typically in a situation like this would call for an authorization vote , and go sell that to the @entity2 people and send a resolution to [ @entity137 ] @entity136 , ' he told @entity28 anchor @entity27			1
' the president has not done that			0
' appearing on ' @entity141 , ' @entity140 sen. @entity140 said the president ' has an obligation to call us back tomorrow to start this debate			0
' but , he claimed , @entity146 in @entity46 are resisting the idea of having to take a stand on going to war in the weeks leading up to an election			0
' i do n't think @entity153 wants this debate or the vote , ' @entity140 said , but ' i think we have an obligation			0
' ' the prime minister of britain called the @entity160 back , ' he noted			0
' no member of @entity46 should be left off the hook			0

@entity121 speaker said sunday that ' it 's gon na take more than airstrikes ' to beat the terror army
numerous military observers have predicted that ' boots on the ground ' will be needed , but president @entity6 insists they wo n't be @entity2
a legendary retired @entity17 general insists it 's *impossible* to defeat @entity8 without a ground campaign
' the only way to defeat @entity8 is to take back land they are occupying , said lord @entity180 , ' which means a conventional military operation '
@entity0 also said he wants the @entity121 to outline a new *permission* - slip for fighting : ' this is a proposal the @entity46 ought to consider '
