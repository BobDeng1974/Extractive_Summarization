criticism : education secretary @entity1 said some families make the wrong decisions and get into financial trouble families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks because of their own ‘ decisions ’ , @entity1 has claimed			1
the @entity1 argued that people who find themselves unable to buy essentials , including food and school uniforms have themselves to blame for being unable ‘ to manage their finances ’			1
the remarks were condemned by @entity15 and ‘ insulting and out of touch ’			1
more than half a million people across @entity18 have turned to food banks to stave off hunger , according to charities			1
ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help			2
cuts to benefits , frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet			0
mr @entity1 was challenged over reports that one in four parents are having to borrow to pay for school uniforms and some food banks were distributing uniforms to struggling parents			2
he said he had recently visited a food bank in his @entity44 constituency			0
but he suggested that many cash - strapped families have brought their problems on themselves			0
he added : ‘ i appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures			0
‘ those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances			2
‘ we need to ensure that support is not just financial , and that the right decisions are made			0
’ mr @entity1 was responding to a question from @entity15 frontbencher @entity60 who demanded to know ‘ what more can he and his government do to ensure that no students turn up to school embarrassed because they do not have the right clothes ’			2
demand : charities say there has been a sharp increase in people turning to food banks , including this one in @entity72 run by @entity73 @entity15 seized on the response with miss @entity60 saying she was ’ appalled ’ by mr @entity1 ’s comments			1
the @entity15 @entity77 mp said : ’ people i have met are ashamed to have to turn to food banks			1
’ i vehemently disagree it is because they have mismanaged their finances			0
’ this government has got no answer to the millions of parents that are really struggling to get by			0
’ citizens advice chief executive @entity88 said : ’ it is appalling to suggest the rise of food banks is due to poor financial management			2
@entity15 frontbencher @entity60 ’ it ’s a smack in the face to families who are working hard but ca n’t make ends meet , leaving them with no other option but to turn to food banks to feed their families			1
’ these comments are completely misjudged			0
’ @entity102 , director of @entity104 's @entity103 , said : ' thousands are now turning to food banks , but they do not so out of choice , they do so when they have nowhere else to turn			1
' the staggering rise in the numbers of people using food banks is down to failings in the benefit system , too many low paid jobs and rising prices that are dragging huge numbers into poverty			1
' in may a report by @entity119 and @entity104 suggested up to half of those seeking help were doing so as a direct result of having benefit payments delayed , reduced or withdrawn			0
other factors behind the increase on those using emergency help - the ' hidden hungry ' - include rising food prices , unemployment and energy costs			0
but energy secretary @entity131 told @entity132 that it was ' completely wrong to suggest that there is some sort of statistical link between the benefit reforms we 're making and the provision of food banks ' .			1
