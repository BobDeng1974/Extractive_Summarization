clearly baffled and obviously just the tiniest bit irked , @entity0 simply did n’t know what to make of @entity3			1
or , more accurately , the @entity7 manager ’s sudden escalation of post-match comments into an all - out conflict			1
back - track or snap right back at him ? stress the good intentions and best wishes he feels towards @entity7 , or defend his team against the insinuation that they ’re a bunch of weak - willed tippy - tap merchants who ca n’t defend crosses ? in the space of 10 minutes on monday , the @entity20 boss did placatory – ‘ i have a lot of respect for @entity3 and what he ’s done ’ – and followed it with accusatory , as in ‘ i think you need to ask @entity3 what he said when he came into my office after we got beat 1 - 0 in the first game ; it certainly was not what he said in the press ( on saturday )			1
’ @entity20 manager @entity0 did not know what to make of @entity3 's recent post-match comments however you choose to interpret everything @entity0 said both on saturday * and * after reading @entity42 ’s sharp response , a lot of people will be watching their next meeting – @entity7 host @entity20 on the last day of the @entity49 season , inevitably enough – for signs of enmity			1
‘ it ’s funny the way football works , ’ said the @entity20 manager , looking ahead to that crucial fixture on saturday week			1
‘ people will make something of it and what has happened			2
but , for someone who is so inexperienced , i am not soft			2
‘ my comments are never made to disrespect people			2
i honestly thought , with our performance , that we played well enough to be in the final			2
i do n’t see anything that is wrong with that			0
‘ everyone in the press conference room after felt we played well but listen , the facts of the matter are that we ’re not in the final			1
what happened as well , everyone in that press conference witnessed me saying good luck to @entity7 , i did n’t see that come out			1
‘ i wished @entity7 all the best and good luck in the final but @entity3 ’s made his comments			1
he ’s a really experienced manager , one that i respect and i ’ll take his comments on board about how he scores against us			1
i ’m obviously learning , this is my first season but i ’m not doing too bad			0
‘ a lack of respect ? not at all , it was my honest opinion that i felt we had done enough in the game to get into the final			1
i do n’t think anyone would deny that or say i was talking gibberish			0
‘ our goals - for is the third best in the table , our goals - against is the second best in the table			0
we have a goal difference that is 27 better than @entity7 ’s			1
when you put that up against a real experienced manager and me being a novice , then i ’m doing okay			2
’ @entity0 and @entity7 manager @entity3 shake hands before the match at @entity105 you see ? amid the attempts to play down any ill will , @entity0 ca n’t help himself			1
@entity42 ’s jibe about his @entity7 team scoring all of their goals against @entity20 from crosses clearly struck a nerve			1
does he have a point ? ‘ i need to be careful what i say here , ’ said @entity0 , who takes his team to @entity116 for yet another crucial @entity49 game tomorrow night			1
‘ i think we all concede goals from crosses			0
i think if @entity3 looks at his own team here , they have conceded a lot of goals from crosses as well			1
‘ whether it is crosses or open play , that ’s football			0
you score goals in different ways			0
we have scored more than most this season and i wo n’t change			0
but i will take his comments on board			2
‘ it is up to @entity3 if he wants to state that			1
i did not say anything about @entity3 ’s team			1
it ’s up to @entity3			1
‘ our relationship in general has been very good			0
i do n’t see why it should change			0
you say things after games in the heat of the moment , more so now with the @entity148 and tv , when you have a microphone stuck under you straightaway			0
the @entity7 players celebrate taking the lead against @entity20 in the @entity154 semi-final at @entity105 ‘ i wo n’t change			1
i still have a lot of respect for @entity3 and what he has done			2
he has done a really good job at @entity7 , so no complaints			2
i do n’t think i have said anything different to what most manager say every weekend			2
’ despite scoring 60 league goals in 33 games , there have been a number of days when @entity20 have felt profligate			1
forever wanting to walk the ball in , as their critics would put it , rather than simply having a dig. insisting he has no concerns despite saturday ’s loss , @entity0 said : ‘ when you play like that , more often than not you are going to win games of football			2
you do n’t rely on a bit of luck because you are performing well			0
‘ i will take the team playing like that every day of the week because i know they will win games of football			0
on saturday it just was not to be , that ’s cup football			0
sometimes it goes in your favour , sometimes it does n’t			0
saturday was one of those times when it did n’t go in our favour			0
‘ on saturday , i felt momentum building			2
@entity190 was top drawer for a period in the second half			0
he nearly won it by himself			0
that is why we are disappointed , players like that , you ’d like to see them in showcase finals , to show their talents			0
but it was not to be			0
they will have another opportunity			0

@entity0 felt @entity20 did enough to reach @entity154 final
