a mother , father and their eight - month old baby boy were killed on monday when a concrete barrier fell onto their truck as they were driving under an overpass in @entity9			1
the tragic accident claimed the lives of @entity12 and @entity13 and baby @entity14 , who were crushed when the 50 - foot - long concrete slab slammed down on top of them , according to @entity18			1
the barrier weighed ' tons ' according to investigators and the damage to the family 's pickup truck was so great that it took them hours to extract the bodies			1
above , the crushed vehicle fatal : the married couple and their baby were driving underneath the state 's @entity44 overpass in @entity35 - where workers were installing a sidewalk - on monday morning			1
above , the scene shockingly , authorities thought that only one person had been killed by the impact , but discovered to their horror that an entire family had been crushed to death according to @entity78			1
while @entity79 once had the world 's best road and transportation network system , but now it is crumbling			0
indeed , according to a former @entity79 transport secretary , @entity83 said there are 70,000 bridges that have been deemed structurally deficient across the nation			0
@entity83 made this damning statistic abundantly clear when he told @entity89 , ' i do n't want to say they 're unsafe			0
i would agree with that			0
' moreso , every four years , the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) releases its comprehensive assessment of the state of @entity79 infrastructure			0
in its most recent one , from 2013 , it gave the nation a grading of @entity101			0
across the @entity79 there are 607,380 bridges according to the @entity94 and they have an average lifespan of 42 years			0
out of those bridges , one in nine is considered to be structurally problematic			0
chief among those are the @entity109 in @entity110 , which has cement too thick for its steel structure to continue supporting and the @entity113 over the @entity114 in @entity115 , which is rusted			0
one of the reasons why things have got so bad is due of course to dwindling investment			0
from 1950 to the 1990s , the investment in infrastructure across the nation stood at two percent of gdp			0
that fell to 1.5 percent in 2012			1
as a comparison @entity126 spends seven percent of its gdp on infrastructure and @entity128 , five percent			0
so large is the problem , that experts have said that either an upsurge in money to rebuilding the nation is needed , or the country will begin to suffer huge problems over the next generation			0
source : the @entity138 / @entity89 @entity35 police officer @entity139 told the @entity140 that the @entity142 family would likely have died on impact and not known much about the accident			1
he said he was confident about this assessment because they found no break marks under the bridge , leading him to believe they had no warning			2
' this is a very unfortunate and sad circumstance , especially in a town this size , ' @entity139 said			0
' this is something that will hit our community big time			2
' the couple celebrated their five year wedding anniversary in early march and were pastors at their local church			1
at the time of the incident , construction crews were working on the sidewalk installation project , it is reported			1
when they finally managed to reach the damaged truck , they found the victims inside			2
' we were just heading down the street ... and i could hear three snaps and down it went on top of the truck , ' witness @entity179 , who was riding in a car behind the pickup , told @entity182			1
she added : ' there was nothing anyone could do			0
' it remains unknown what caused the ' very heavy ' concrete structure to fall , @entity190 5 reported			2
@entity192 spokesman @entity191 said the material that fell in @entity35 - situated around 30 mile southeast of @entity194 , @entity9 - was part of the original span , which was built in 1992			1
it has a sufficiency rating of 95.3 out of 100 , according to @entity199			0
