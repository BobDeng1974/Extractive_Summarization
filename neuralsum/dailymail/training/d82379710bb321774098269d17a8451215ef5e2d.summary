by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 21 june 2013 @entity3 v @entity1 click here for the full draw and print it out for your wall here @entity1 has been drawn in the same half as both @entity8 and @entity7 at @entity28 , although he will only have to beat one of them en route to the final			1
no 2 seed @entity1 faces a potential quarter - final against @entity35 , who he beat at @entity36 last week , before a potential last - four clash against either @entity8 or @entity7 , who are scheduled to meet in a mouth - watering last - eight tie			1
@entity7 ’s number five seeding proved particularly bad news for defending champion @entity8 , who might be hoping that his compatriot @entity11 could take him out in a possible fourth round before they even meet			1
@entity44 is a rough quarter of the draw			0
the lumping in together of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity1 also means that there will be a blockbuster first day at @entity28 on monday with all three of them in action			1
test : @entity1 , pictured wearing his new adidas kit , has been drawn in the same half as @entity8 and @entity7 at @entity28 repeat : @entity1 will play @entity3 in the first round , who he beat at @entity36 last week old foes : no 5 seed @entity7 faces the prospect of a mouth - watering quarter - final against @entity8 @entity1 ’s first week looks relatively benign until the gradient gets tougher after the middle weekend , although it is hardly a straightforward start either			1
in the first round he is up against 31 year - old @entity3 , a decent grass court player , having beaten him at @entity64 ’s last week			1
he could then meet @entity65 wildcard @entity18 , or @entity66 ’s @entity16 , the world number 74 , who beat the 26 year - old @entity68 at the @entity69 and is happy on faster surfaces with a @entity28 win against @entity72 on his cv			1
the first two seeds @entity1 is scheduled to meet are @entity76 veteran @entity75 and @entity78 @entity77 , although what could materialise is a third round against excellent grass courter @entity81 , of @entity28 marathon fame			2
@entity1 ’s quarter final opponent is slated to be one of @entity35 or @entity14 , the two players he beat over finals weekend at the @entity88			1
but with @entity5 getting the better end of things with @entity92 the other top - four seed in his half , all eyes will be on the potential classic match - up of @entity7 versus @entity8			1
opener : reigning champion @entity8 will begin his title defence against @entity10 on monday familiar : @entity1 could face @entity35 in the quarter - finals , who he beat at @entity64 's last week kind : @entity5 has been drawn in the opposite half to @entity1 , @entity7 and @entity8 @entity21 , one of only three @entity65 men in the main draw , will have a tough baptism against the hugely talented 6ft 8ins pole @entity19 , already ranked 22 in the world , whose temperament can be an achilles heel			1
@entity110 1 @entity5 will play @entity4 in the first round before a potential quarter - final against @entity113			1
the @entity78 has been handed the easier draw with @entity1 , @entity8 and @entity7 all on the opposite side			1
@entity5 could meet either @entity92 or @entity116 in the semis			0
@entity118 champion @entity7 will begin his tournament against @entity6 while defending champion @entity8 opens @entity122 proceedings on monday against @entity10			1
baby - faced : @entity1 is consoled by @entity123 in 2005 @entity1 will make his eighth appearance at @entity28 looking to end @entity65 's long wait for a home men 's singles champion			1
here , @entity128 assesses the @entity131 winner 's performances on his previous visits to @entity133			0
2005 : @entity1 made his senior @entity28 debut at the age of 18			0
there was great excitement surrounding the teenager following his win in the @entity131 juniors in 2004 and he justified the hype by reaching the third round			0
@entity1 's first match was a comfortable win over @entity145 and he followed that up by eliminating 14th seed @entity147			2
next up was former finalist @entity123 and the young @entity68 looked set for a famous win when he took a two - set lead before cramp took its toll			2
2006 : @entity1 was now the leading @entity65 player and again he did not disappoint			2
victories over @entity155 and @entity156 set up a blockbuster clash with top - five player and former finalist @entity72			2
@entity1 had beaten the @entity159 en route to winning his first @entity161 title in @entity162 earlier in the season and he repeated the feat with a brilliant straight - sets win			0
the @entity68 could not maintain that standard , though , and lost to @entity15 in the fourth round			0
2008 : after missing the 2007 championships with a wrist injury , @entity1 was looking to make up for lost time			0
he reached the fourth round with relative ease to set up a clash with @entity174 that turned out to be one of @entity28 's classic encounters as the @entity68 hit back from two sets and a break down to reach the quarter - finals for the first time			1
hopes were high as he prepared to face eventual champion @entity7 but it proved to be a one - sided affair in the @entity185 's favour			2
2009 : with @entity7 unable to defend his title because of injury , @entity1 was the highest seed in his half of the draw			2
he almost came unstuck in the fourth round against an inspired @entity11 in the first match to be played entirely under the new @entity122 roof before prevailing in a deciding set			0
@entity1 reached the semi-finals for the first time and was favourite to see off @entity72 but he paid for a cautious approach and was beaten in four sets			0
2010 : the @entity65 number one came into @entity28 in indifferent form but by the end of the first week it was clear he would be a contender once again			0
a victory over @entity204 in front of the @entity64 was a highlight and he was not really tested until a quarter - final clash with big - hitting @entity208 @entity35			1
@entity210 earned the world number four another shot at @entity7 but , despite doing most things right , it was not even enough for him to win a set			0
2011 : @entity7 again in the semi-finals , and more despair loomed for @entity1			2
this time he led , and had @entity7 in trouble			0
but a loose forehand early in the second set was the beginning of @entity1 's demise			2
@entity7 seized on the sign of weakness to win in four sets			0
even though @entity1 felt he was playing better tennis than he had in 2010 , it was scant consolation as he said : ' it 's tough			0
but i 'm giving it my best shot each time			0
i 'm trying my hardest			0
that 's all you can do			0
' 2012 : this time @entity1 reached the final , and had all of @entity65 abuzz as he attempted to become the first home champion since @entity237 in 1936			1
his opponent , @entity8 , had other ideas though			0
despite making a great start , @entity1 lost 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 3 6 - 4 as @entity8 landed his seventh @entity28 title			2
revenge of sorts came in the @entity245 final , back at @entity28 , as @entity1 thrashed @entity8 .			1
