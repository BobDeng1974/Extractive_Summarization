@entity0 ( @entity1 ) 238 points 2			1
@entity3 ( @entity1 ) 216 points 3			1
@entity5 ( @entity6 ) 166 points the notion that @entity3 did not win the @entity11 @entity10 fair and square is about as believable as @entity13 faking his own death			1
both can be found in the file under ‘ f ’ for far - fetched			2
the incident that turned the race in @entity3 ’s favour was when he was pursuing @entity0 along the start straight at 220mph			1
the @entity22 seemingly cracked , ran straight on at the chicane and surrendered the lead			1
the tv camera caught @entity1 boss @entity26 smiling on the pit wall			0
the cynics took this as a sign that he had ordered @entity0 to give way to make up for having crashed into @entity33 in the previous race in @entity35 , and was delighted to see the crafty plan carried out so adroitly			1
‘ there was very little rubber smoke			0
i do n’t quite understand why it happened on a very easy part of the track			0
i thought it was a bit too easy			0
he could have at least made an effort to get round the corner but he did n’t			2
’ fuel to the conspiracy fire is that @entity0 made the same mistake at the same point earlier in the race			1
barring @entity77 ’s brake failure , no other driver missed the chicane all race			1
@entity61 added : ‘ the first time i thought “ that ’s wise ” ; the second time i thought : “ hello , what ’s going on here ? ” ’ @entity84 is not totally unused to such things			2
the @entity86 was fixed by @entity87 asking @entity88 to crash to let @entity90 win			2
but @entity88 was a desperate man seeking a new contract			0
@entity0 is fighting for the world drivers ’ championship			2
‘ i just messed up , ’ said the @entity22			0
‘ what would be the reason for me to do something like that deliberately ? there is no possible reason			0
‘ if you ’re ordered by the team to do it then you would do it , but there is no reason why the team would ask me to change position , or something like that			0
‘ the only thing in people ’s minds could be spa , but @entity35 was a mistake i ’ve apologised for			0
‘ it ’s not like we are now starting to shuffling our cars			0
’ @entity26 was even more emphatic , saying : ‘ only a paranoid mind would have dreamed up such an idea			0
’ indeed , why go to such lengths to fix the result when there are so many easier ways of doing it ? they could have issued an order over the radio or fumbled a pit stop ? in the total absence of evidence of a foul play , i would rather give credit to @entity3 for the stridency of his driving that forced the mistake from the usually unflappable @entity0			1
@entity3 ’s victory – his sixth of the season – was achieved despite an awful start that took him from pole to fourth position by the first corner after a technical problem with his launch setting			1
he recovered manfully , even seizing the initiative to charge at @entity0 there and then despite the advice from the pit wall to sit back and conserve his tyres for the end of the race			1
his sense of adventure , shrewd tactical judgment , meant he was on @entity0 ’s tail by 29th and pivotal lap. @entity0 went off when @entity3 was just over a second behind him			1
@entity3 was untroubled all afternoon			2
@entity0 came home second , his lead trimmed to 22 points with six races remaining			1
finally , @entity3 had had some luck in a season that has tripped him up at every turn			1
watching slightly fretfully , as is his wont , was @entity3 ’s father @entity166 and his step - mother @entity167			1
@entity166 ’s verdict was both blunt and encouraging			0
‘ @entity3 drove the way he knows best and that is what he needs to do from now on , ’ he said			2
‘ he can catch up in this championship			0
it is just head down and drive like he did in go - karts – to win			0
drive to win , no other way			0
‘ what has happened to @entity3 in the past few weeks has been unreal			2
sometimes things go well and then they go badly			0
it is down to the strength of character of the driver to keep plugging away and be honest about hard it is			0
it is not about engines or anything , it is about getting out there and doing your job			0
‘ it is all character building but it is extraordinary – and that is why i am feeling this extra special something , that this championship is about giving @entity3 such a hard time but he comes through it			1
we just have to keep the faith			0
’ away from @entity1 , there was a minor disaster for @entity204			2
@entity90 was non-classified for the first time in five years when his battery pack gave up on him			1
@entity207 scored a mere two points			0
it was hardly what the throng who made their traditional post-race pilgrimage along the start straight wanted			2
but there were many others – @entity218 - waving @entity55 fans – among the tifosi got the winner they craved			1
some of them again , regrettably , booed @entity0 for his spa mistake			1
he had finally secured a psychological blow , one that will mean far more to him if , as seems likely , it was earned fairly			0
mistake : @entity0 ran straight on at the chicane on lap 29 to hand the lead to @entity1 team - mate @entity3 under pressure : the @entity22 driver was being closely followed by his team - mate @entity3 when he made the crucial mistake braking point : @entity0 attempts to brake but is forced off the track under pressure from @entity3 at @entity235 decisive moment : @entity0 fails to make the turn , running straight across the chicane at @entity235 , and forcing him on to the escape road @entity240 : by the time the @entity22 had negotiated the bollards @entity3 had emerged into the lead , which he never gave up disappointing : @entity90 of @entity204 failed to finish for the first time this season because of a gearbox failure as @entity204 struggled in their home race despondent : @entity90 trudges away , clearly devastated , after being forced to stop at @entity41 fighting hard : @entity247 overtakes @entity249 's @entity248 in an intriguing battle for eighth place			1

@entity3 started the race on pole but fell to fourth by the first corner
but @entity55 driver fought back and retook the lead after @entity0 made a mistake on lap 29
@entity3 reduces gap to @entity0 , who is booed on *podium* for second straight race , to 22 points
@entity49 take third for @entity268 ahead of team - mate @entity269
@entity90 fails to finish for the first time this season after *mechiacal* failure in a poor home race for @entity204
