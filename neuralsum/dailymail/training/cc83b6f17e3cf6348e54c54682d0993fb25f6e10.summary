sir @entity0 may have rhapsodised about playing tennis with @entity2 , who had ‘ the speed of a swallow , the grace of a boy ’			2
but the modern tennis heroine has rather more weapons in her arsenal — and we are not just talking about ability on the court			2
@entity13 , 20 years old and @entity14 , is gloriously blonde with perfectly regular , brilliantly white film - star teeth , a pair of oiled thighs that could crack walnuts , half a million fans on @entity20 — and a @entity22 profile which ranges from the flirtatious to the , frankly , provocative			1
indeed , the new face of women ’s tennis - who will be fighting to be crowned @entity27 champion on saturday — likes to post pictures of herself lounging seductively in bikinis and pouting in fancy dress			1
@entity43 , money - making and with an ambition and drive which make the rest of the tennis crowd - no offence @entity48 - look like a bunch of shuffling amateurs			2
her smitten fans , known as the @entity53 , follow her around the globe and , in a mawkish display of puppy love , throw teddy bears on to the court , some with proposals of marriage attached			0
adorable though she may be , @entity13 can also be utterly ruthless - in a charming way - when it comes to fulfilling her role as champ - in - waiting			1
for example , she was once best friends with @entity69 tennis hope @entity67 , who is also 20			1
they met aged nine and were inseparable for a decade			0
they were once so close that @entity72 stayed with @entity73 at her family home near the @entity36 when they played there			1
as teenagers they dined together every night during overseas tournaments and two years ago made a video featuring tennis stars - including @entity48 - performing @entity81 dance moves			2
but there has been an acrimonious falling out			0
asked on friday if they were still close , @entity13 responded bluntly : ‘ no. i do n’t think so , ’ adding ‘ i ’m sure you guys can figure out that one ... i ’ll leave it at that			1
’ the rift is believed to be over @entity89 , the leading coach who runs the @entity91 tennis academy where they first met			1
while the pair previously shared his services , he now coaches @entity13 exclusively			1
falling out : @entity13 ( right ) and @entity69 's @entity67 ( left ) used to be inseparable but are no long close their friendship has deteriorated further during the past year as @entity13 accelerated ahead of her former friend			1
she has climbed into the tennis top ranks , while @entity73 peaked when she reached the fourth round of last year ’s @entity27 , then missed this year ’s championships with a wrist injury			1
she now languishes at 91 in the world rankings			2
tennis insiders say the girls no longer speak , let alone post pictures of themselves together on social networking sites as they once did so regularly			2
before the @entity108 , @entity13 said she did n’t have a best friend : ‘ i do n’t think the tennis tour is the place to have friends			1
for me it ’s all competition			0
’ where her twin sister @entity114 is concerned , @entity13 says they are ‘ opposites ’ and ‘ very different ’			1
@entity114 , she adds , ‘ retired from tennis aged six ’ , and they see little of each other as @entity13 criss - crosses the globe in search of sporting glory			1
@entity114 , a student , is the older by six minutes			0
speaking to reporters , she claimed to have a telepathic link with @entity13 and broke into a broad smile over her sister ’s achievements			1
‘ every day i am just in awe , ’ she said			0
‘ i have seen everything she has missed out on in childhood and teenage years			0
she has sacrificed a lot to get where she is today			0
’ @entity13 has self - belief and focus by the bucketload			1
when she met tennis legend @entity136 at an event in @entity138 in january , she was far from over-awed			2
bffs no more : when asked if she was close with @entity73 anymore , @entity13 said : ' no. i do n't think so			1
i 'm sure you guys can figure out that one ... i 'll leave it at that ' tight bond : as teenagers @entity13 would stay at @entity73 's house when she played at @entity27 @entity136 tweeted : ‘ @ @entity148 has informed me that there are more cameras focused on her ... ’ by the end of the day they were apparently friends , and @entity136 wrote : ‘ ok , spent the whole day with @ @entity154 : genuine , mature , determined , and really funny ! ! ! ’ or , as she told a reporter that day , more bluntly : ‘ she is as tough as nails			1
’ so who is @entity13 ? born on february 25 , 1994 , in @entity159 , she is the product of a wealthy suburban upbringing			1
her father @entity162 , known as @entity163 , is an investment banker , and mum @entity164 is a great fan of the @entity165 — which is why she called her twin girls @entity13 and @entity114			1
‘ when i was young my mum gave me a magazine with the two princesses in it and i still keep it on my bedside table , ’ @entity13 says			1
her younger brother is named @entity172 after prince @entity172 and the eldest of the siblings is @entity174 , after princess @entity175 of @entity176			0
home was in the posh suburb of @entity179 - in the same street as former @entity14 prime minister @entity181			0
the children were introduced to tennis at a young age , but @entity13 , then aged five , detested the ‘ childish ’ games involving hula hoops and balloons that were supposed to interest them in the sport			1
acrimonious : the rift between @entity13 and @entity73 is reportedly over coach @entity89 choosing to work with the @entity14 exclusively confronting : @entity13 remonstrates with the chair umpire during her semi-final victory at @entity27 ‘ all of the kids , including my sister , loved the games , except me , ’ she told the @entity194 newspaper			1
‘ i hated them , i just wanted to hit more balls and actually play tennis			2
‘ eventually , i started playing three times a week , then took private lessons and played my first tournament aged eight			0
i loved it right away			0
’ extraordinarily , this was when she decided that tennis was to be her life			2
‘ @entity206 is very young to decide what you want to do in life , but that is pretty much when i decided , ’ she said			0
when she was 12 , @entity13 had the chance to move to @entity91 to train with coach @entity89 at his academy			1
the whole family relocated to @entity91 from @entity159 — and moved back a few years later , after @entity214 agreed to pay for an exclusive trainer for her in @entity159			0
she continues to train with @entity89 in @entity91 for part of the year , and spends the rest of it on the tour , going home to @entity159 for visits when she can			1
@entity222 — like the parents of champs @entity224 and @entity226 — has taken a hands - on approach to building his daughter ’s sporting career , sometimes with excessive zeal			0
@entity13 tried to claim thousands that he personally spent on his daughter ’s dream in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 as business losses against tax — but @entity14 ’s tax service disallowed it			1
an embarrassing episode perhaps , but @entity13 continued her march to tennis glory			1
she won @entity27 in 2012 and last year was named @entity243 tennis newcomer of the year			1
she reached the semis of the @entity245 in january and the @entity246			0
moving on : @entity13 defeated @entity247 in straight set to win her place in saturday 's @entity251 decider clash : the 13th seed ( left ) faces sixth seed and 2011 winner @entity255 ( right ) on @entity256 her prize money to date stands at £ 1 million — her greater earnings come from endorsements , which so far include @entity260 and @entity261 , and she has been in @entity262 and other fashion magazines			1
she is now being courted by watch manufacturers , jewellery designers , clothes labels and banks			0
@entity48 , the best financially rewarded female athlete on the planet , netted £ 15 million last year with her deals with @entity270 , @entity271 , et al			0
fancy dress : @entity13 ( right ) with twin sister @entity114 @entity13 ’s agent , @entity274 , is tipping her to become the most famous player in the world			2
‘ she ’s got the personality , she ’s got the game , she ’s got the looks , ’ he said			0
‘ she speaks two languages [ @entity281 and @entity282 ] and the crossover appeal is great			0
@entity285 fans love her , @entity281 fans love her			0
’ ‘ she understands that the better she plays tennis , the more money , the more marketable and the more famous she will be			2
but it ’s all centred on the tennis			2
’ @entity291 , of sports agency @entity292 , agrees that @entity13 could unseat the glorious @entity48 as the game ’s top earner			2
her use of social media already sets her apart and makes her all the more valuable as a commodity			0
she is , online at least , an unabashed flirt — posting a selfie with the actor @entity300 earlier this year ; a picture of herself on her birthday , lying on her bed surrounded by flowers and birthday wishes ; and one on @entity307 with a hand - drawn card : ‘ from me , to me			0
’ all of which makes her fans love her even more			0
she is , though , apparently quietly going out with @entity312 ice hockey player @entity311 , who plays for a @entity14 team			0
before that she was dating @entity285 tennis star @entity315			2
she faces no 6 seed @entity255 as @entity14 ’s first @entity317 singles finalist at @entity27 , and is brimming with confidence			1
‘ it ’s not a surprise to me			0
i expect to be in these finals			0
i totally feel like i belong			0
i want to make my own history			0
’ as well as her own millions .			0

@entity325 , 20 , will contest the @entity27 final on saturday
she meets @entity255 on @entity256 at the @entity36
@entity13 used to be close friends with @entity69 's @entity67
the pair had fell out , reportedly about their former coach @entity89
friendship deteriorated as @entity13 flew up the rankings ahead of @entity73
@entity13 said : ' i do n't think the tennis tour is the place to have friends '
