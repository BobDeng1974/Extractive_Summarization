smartphones often overheat if they 're held close to the body or are used for long periods of time			0
and while the dangers of overheating lithium ion ( @entity8 ) batteries have been known for some time , researchers have now revealed exactly what happens inside the ' burning ' cells			1
thermal images show copper inside the battery reaching temperatures of at least 1,085 ° @entity15 ) causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent			1
copper inside melted , indicating temperatures of at least 1,085 ° c ( 1,985 ° f ) , and it caused molten material to stream from the vent ( pictured ) the footage is the first time the failure of @entity8 due to overheating has been recorded			1
it was filmed by @entity37 from @entity38 and the findings are published in the journal @entity41			0
li - ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway , which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost			1
although battery failure is rare , prevention of thermal runaway presents one of the greatest challenges for the safe operation of lithium - ion batteries			1
dr @entity37 and his colleagues subjected two commercial li - ion batteries , known as @entity58 2 , to external heat			1
they then used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe the internal structure of each			2
li - ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway , which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost			1
a @entity8 before being subjected to high temperatures is shown left , the same battery after heat abuse is shown right during tests , one cell remained intact during battery failure and as the heat - generating reactions continued , hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery ’s vent ( pictured left to right )			1
by comparison , the rapid pressure rise in a second cell caused the entire cap of the cell to detach cell 1 remained intact during battery failure and as the heat - generating reactions continued , hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery ’s vent			1
li - ion batteries have been known to overheat and are vulnerable to thermal runaway			1
this occurs when the rate of heat generated in the cell is greater than the rate of heat lost			2
lithium - ion cells with cobalt cathodes , for example , are not designed to rise above 130 ° @entity101 )			1
this is because , at 150 ° @entity104 ) the cell becomes ' thermally unstable '			2
once it reaches this state it can lead to a thermal runaway in which flaming gases are released			0
during a thermal runaway , the high heat in the failing cell can travel to the next cell , causing it to become thermally unstable as well			2
in some cases , a chain reaction occurs in which each cell disintegrates one - by - one			2
this means a battery pack can be destroyed within seconds , or the venting of gases and heat can last for hours			0
as a safety measure , packs are fitted with dividers to protect failing cells from affecting nearby cells			0

by comparison , the rapid pressure rise in @entity134 caused the entire cap of the cell to detach			0
in a real - world situation this could have increased thermal runaway because it allows oxygen into the cell			2
during a thermal runaway , the high heat in the failing cell can travel to the next cell , causing it to become thermally unstable as well			2

this means a battery pack can be destroyed within seconds or the venting of gases and heat can last for hours			0
as a safety measure , packs are fitted with dividers to protect the failing cell form affecting nearby cells			0
the authors found that thermal and electrochemical reactions inside both cells produced gas pockets that deformed the spiral wound layers of the cells			0
cell 2 showed severe internal distortion of its architecture , which the authors suggest compromised its safety			0
unlike @entity134 , @entity58 1 was designed with a central cylindrical support , which seemed to help maintain its structural integrity			0
the authors hope their observations will lead to improvements in the design of @entity8 and improve their safety features .			0
