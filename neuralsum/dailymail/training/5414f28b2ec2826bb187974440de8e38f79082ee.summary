by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 praised the courage of his @entity5 side after they came close to matching world champions @entity8 in their own backyard			1
for four minutes the @entity10 dared to believe after @entity12 's superb solo goal cancelled out @entity14 's first half opener			1
sloppy defending allowed @entity14 to add a second – his 25th for his country – in the 70th minute			1
proud : @entity2 said he felt @entity5 performed well and could have won the game but the @entity17 ended the 2 - 1 win in @entity20 's @entity19 clinging to three @entity22 qualifying points – despite a bizarre red card to @entity24 for time wasting when the @entity10 were desperately chasing an equaliser			1
' the @entity17 are always going to have more of the ball , and more chances , ' said @entity2 , ' that goes without saying			1
at 1 - 1 i genuinely believed we could win the game			1
i saw the players playing with no fear			2
' the first 20 minutes , it was n't fear			2
we just asked the players to look out for passes , but they rushed these passes and we lost the ball quite a lot			1
that gave the @entity17 easy possession			2
' so we had to adjust after 20 minutes and then we settled down a bit			2
in the second half we played with no fear and , as i say , at 1 - 1 i genuinely believed we were going to win the game			1
' the @entity10 succumbed to a preventable winner from @entity14 despite crafting a raft of second half chances against a much changed @entity8 side			1
opener : @entity14 scored the opening goal for @entity8 with a looping header in the first half declining to criticise the quality of the defending @entity2 added : ' if you can find me someone who is 6ft 4in and can head the ball for miles and jump about 8ft like @entity14 can then it 's avoidable			1
' but we do n't have anybody like that and i think most countries in the world are the same			0
when you are delaing with an exceptional machine like @entity14 then you 'll have a problem			1
that 's always going to be the difference			2
' goalkeeper @entity71 kept the @entity10 in the game during a backs to the wall first half before the team improved significantly in the second , substitute @entity77 making a big impact by sending @entity79 in for his cool finish			0
picked over @entity81 and @entity82 said of @entity71 : ' i think if you look at our substitutes and how well they played you can see i can big decisions all over the place			0
' everybody has their strengths so you pick a team with the strengths to play the team you 're playing			0
' i could actually have picked another team and it would have given us the same performance			0
that is how good our squad is getting			0
equaliser : @entity12 beat offside trap to equalise for @entity5 in the second half ' but i did the easy bit , i just had to sit there and tick things off on my sheet and write notes			1
the players should be proud of how they played			0
' i think in the first 20 minutes we could have done things better as a group			0
' but once we got that sort out we had no fear of the game , which i thought was great			0
and the longer the game went on the more a threat we became			0
' so the players really should be proud of their performance			2
' all we have to do is work on how we play in the first 20 minutes and when we get that sorted out we 'll be fine , we 'll be good			0
' the only sour note came after @entity5 players thronged @entity124 referee @entity123 over a series of dubious decisions in the closing stages			1
the official sent off @entity24 for a second bookable offence for time wasting when the @entity10 were chasing an equaliser			0
@entity5 also believed they should have had a penalty for handball and were angered the final whistle went as they won a corner			2
winner : @entity5 's joy was short - lived as @entity14 scored the winner just four minutes later ' i went onto the pitch to make sure my coaching staff did n't overstep the mark and to congratulate the lads , ' said @entity2 , restraining himself afterwards			1
' i think we try our best not to speak about referees but i would love to see the referee 's assessment of that performance			2
that 's all i 've got to say about it			0
' i 'd like to see the referee 's assessment of the game			0
unfortunately we do n't get to see them though			0
' ultimately @entity5 were undone by a world class finisher , with @entity14 – and the @entity10 – earning praise from @entity158 afterwards			1
' nothing @entity14 does astonishes me			2
he is always clinical in front of goal and is always there when you need him			0
that 's what he does			0
' @entity5 has n't lost for a year now and won two times against @entity167 and in @entity168 so we knew they would be a very difficult opponent			1
' we did make a few mistakes at the back and they capitalised on that but i always believed we had it in us to score a second goal and in the end we did			0
' managers : @entity179 said he had expected @entity2 's @entity5 to put up a good fight			1

@entity5 lost to @entity8 2 - 1
@entity14 's looping header gave @entity8 the lead
@entity12 beat offside trap to equalise for @entity5
but @entity14 added a second just four minutes later
@entity2 praised his players ' performance
