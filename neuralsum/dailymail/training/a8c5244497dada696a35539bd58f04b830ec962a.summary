by @entity0 @entity1 will play against @entity2 on wednesday even if it means having a pain - killing injection for a toe injury prior to the game , manager @entity6 said			1
@entity7 are in desperate need of @entity1 's power and finishing ability in @entity11 as they look to improve on a 1 - 1 home draw in the first leg of their @entity15 quarter - final last week and book a spot in the last four			1
' he will definitely play , ' @entity6 said in his pre-match press conference			1
' we will do all we can to get him on the pitch			0
he is happy to take an injection			2
he 's not trained all week so we need to be wary of that			2
' he is ready to take an injection which shows you his feeling for the game and the club			1
we think it ’s ok because we would n’t do anything wrong , and we take advice from our doctors			0
' everybody knows the character @entity45 is and the kind of player he is			0
he is determined to play and if he is determined we would be mad not to play him			0
' it is the hardest game for us so far			2
both teams have top players			0
' confidence : @entity6 and veteran @entity53 talk up @entity7 's chances against @entity2 smiles better : @entity56 , who scored a brace against @entity58 on saturday , and @entity59 in good spirits just for laughs : @entity62 shares a joke with @entity64 ahead of @entity7 's tie against @entity2 @entity6 said every player would need to be at their best and that his team needed to improve from their first - leg performance in order to edge past last season 's treble winners into the semi-finals			1
' we can and will play better than in the first leg and we have to play better in order to progress , ' said @entity6			1
' we will need a good performance from everyone			0
we can not have any passengers			2
' it [ the tactical approach ] does n’t alter a lot because if @entity2 score we have to score as well			1
' we have to go out and win the game but we have to be better on the ball in the game than we were in the first			0
' but we need the determination to get the result			0
' light - hearted : @entity1 ( left ) jokes with @entity90 in training ahead of the big match back then : @entity1 has scored at the @entity92 before , in a 2 - 1 defeat in 2010 @entity7 were all but written off before the first leg against the powerful @entity95 , but have given themselves a chance with the draw at @entity98			1
but @entity100 teams have generally done well in @entity30 over the last couple seasons , and @entity6 is aware of this			1
' i think it would be something which is more in @entity2 ’s mind that the @entity100 teams have come here and got a good record			2
they will have that doubt in their mind			0
' they are @entity112 champions but they will have the games they have played against @entity100 teams in mind			0
we will try to use it to your advantage			0
' the big time : a result could be @entity6 ' defining moment as @entity7 manager treble : @entity124 is looking for a third @entity15 triumph @entity2 slumped to their first league defeat in 53 games on saturday and have gone three games without a win for the first time since 2011			1
another worry for @entity2 is their failure to win any of their last four matches against @entity100 opposition at the @entity25 , a run that started with their penalty shootout defeat to @entity141 in the 2012 @entity15 final			2
they have since lost and drawn against @entity144 and lost to @entity145			0
@entity7 's own recent form , on the other hand , with four goals in each of their last two @entity149 wins , is another encouraging sign for @entity6 .			1

@entity1 is set to start against @entity2 on wednesday night
the @entity7 star will take a pain - killing injection before the game
he trained with his @entity7 team - mates on tuesday before *flying* to @entity30
@entity6 says @entity7 ca *n't* have any ' passengers ' in order to progress
