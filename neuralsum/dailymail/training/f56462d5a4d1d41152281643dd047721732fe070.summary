opening the curtains in the bedroom last week , i let out a loud groan			2
gone was my manicured grass , an acre of which had stretched down to the woods beyond our house in @entity9			2
in its place ? a sea of churned - up turf			2
the ornamental vases and topiary which had highlighted the lawn ’s lush green were surrounded by huge heaps of earth			1
while horrified by the sight that confronted me , i was far from baffled			2
for i knew exactly who the culprit was — our midnight gardener , @entity23 the badger , named after the @entity27 character , digging in search of worms			1
in summer and winter they leave us alone and undisturbed , but every autumn they come scurrying across and tear up our lawn			1
and this year it ’s not just my area of @entity50 that is being ravaged by these hungry lawn - destroyers			1
the unusually warm september meant that badgers were unable to dig through the dry soil to reach those juicy worms on which they feast			1
with the soil now softening up after a rain - drenched first half to october , the worms have become more easily obtainable			1
that , coupled with an abundance of autumnal insect larvae , means it ’s ‘ grub up ’ time — and lawns such as mine are the dinner table			1
with a @entity66 population of well over 800,000 badgers , this seasonal onslaught will be happening nationwide			1
and whereas boasting of a ‘ badger problem ’ used to be a badge of honour among the middle classes — a sign you had a large garden in the country — now they are digging up gardens of all shapes and sizes			1
as urban areas continue to expand and sprawling housing developments encroach on badger territories , which can run to several acres , more people are finding themselves reluctant members of the badger set			1
in summer and winter they leave us alone and undisturbed , but every autumn they come scurrying across and tear up our lawn this is no comfort to keen gardeners who take pride in a well - tended sward , though			1
to them , the badger is a pest			2
as for me , despite his night - time mauraudings , i confess i am strangely fond of our badger — or meles meles to give him his scientific name			2
my wife @entity103 has never quite forgiven me for once missing our wedding anniversary evening because i was so entranced watching a badger sett in the garden			2
my fondness for the creatures goes back to my schooldays in @entity110 in the @entity111 , when i discovered a badger sett only a ten - minute cycle ride from where we lived			2
many an evening i ’d shoot off down the lane to where the sett was — at the bottom of a bungalow ’s garden , on a bank , half - hidden in a thicket of holly			1
it was there that i met my first badger			0
it suddenly filled the sett ’s darkening entrance with a blur of black and white , standing motionless , listening			1
then he quietly slipped out and sniffed the air , paw raised			0
a smaller , slimmer badger appeared behind him			0
they touched noses and purred			0
then the sow rolled over and , with both front paws , gave her belly a hearty scratch , lips curled back in a blissful grin			0
it was strangely human and utterly enchanting to watch			0
so much like ourselves , waking , stretching and scratching as we embrace a new day — or night , in the badgers ’ case			1
they are noctural creatures , after all			0
the @entity66 has a population of well over 800,000 badgers many decades later , i try to remind myself of those fond memories as i set to work each morning with a trowel , on my knees , shuffling back and forth across my dewy lawn , rolling back each uprooted sod and uttering that same word out loud ( with a rather different meaning ) to vent my displeasure at the culprit			1
many of the holes i fill are round or elliptical			0
these are snuffle - holes , where the badger had pushed his snout down into the ground so he could suck up a juicy worm without breaking it in two			1
worms make up half of a badger ’s diet			1
he will seek out insect larvae as well — cockchafers and leatherjackets in particular — in the roots of the grass , which is deftly pulled up and rolled back using his razor - sharp claws			0
he is also partial to slugs and snails , and will take on small mammals such as rats , mice , rabbits and hedgehogs if available			0
but worms are his staple			1
with each sod thumped back into place i remember a similar thud when i was 18 — the noise of my head hitting the bank after i fell out of a tree during another night - time badger - watching expedition			0
that thud left me with a broken neck , which healed only after i had lain immobilised on my back for six weeks , not permitted to move			0
i still get the occasional twinge			0
so it was with mingled pleasure and annoyance that i greeted @entity23 into my garden three years ago — and every year since			0
nostalgia quickly turned to annoyance as he settled in , clearly identifying my lawn as a great snacking spot			1
night after night i leapt out of bed earlier and earlier , dragging back the curtains to be confronted by yet another ravaging of the lawn			1
‘ well , do something to deter him , ’ growled my wife , retreating under the duvet while i stomped out to don my wellingtons as the sun rose			0
a google search produced some possibilities — but with a warning			0
badgers are protected under the @entity228 and neither the animal or its sett can be interfered with except in special circumstances requiring a licence			1
in the case of gardens , this has to be issued by the government ’s agricultural department , which in @entity50 is @entity238			1
i toyed with several options but in the end it was something of my own doing that proved to be most successful			0
it was entirely legal and @entity23 found it very off - putting			0
knowing how badgers have a highly developed sense of smell and mark their territory with urine and badger musk , i reasoned that if i marked mine in similar fashion , such a strong human scent should put him off			1
there is no chemical that can legally be used as a badger deterrent			0
using one means you are at risk of committing an offence under pesticide regulations or wildlife protection laws so one evening i peed into a used disinfectant sprayer and sneaked out last thing to scurry round the lawn , pumping the sprayer furiously — pssss , pssss			1
opening the curtains the next morning , i found that the lawn was untouched			1
i smiled when i thought of @entity23 tutting at my antisocial night - time activities for once			0
will i be able to keep up my anti-badger campaign ? i ’m not sure how much longer i ’ll be able to keep it secret , but i guess at least there is a continual , ready supply of the repellent			0
and this , my fellow gardeners , is my gift to you			0
from chopped chillies to strobe lighting , the ways to fight back @entity283 there is no chemical that can legally be used as a badger deterrent			1
using one means you are at risk of committing an offence under pesticide regulations or wildlife protection laws			0
some years back i discovered a rusty old tin of a badger deterrent called @entity295 — now banned — left by the previous owners of our house			0
at the time we ’d had a few badger incursions , so i gave it a go			0
it meant painting a vile - smelling liquid on string strung across the lawn			1
it drove the badgers away but almost drove us out , too			1
the smell pervaded every corner of our property and neighbours phoned to ask if we had a leaking septic tank			0
soaking strips of cloth in @entity315 or @entity316 and draping them across the lawn may make @entity23 take one sniff and move on , but it needs to be done at dusk and repeated daily			2
@entity321 sprinkling finely chopped red chilli peppers around can be effective if your lawn is n’t too large			2
i tried it , stripping a supermarket of its stock and raising the eyebrows of the cashier at the checkout			0
‘ for the badgers , ’ i said			2
i was given a sad look			0
my look was even sadder later when , having strewn mashed peppers across the lawn , i stood back and , without thinking , rubbed my left eye			2
@entity339 gadgets a variety of ultrasonic alarms are available online and in some diy stores which emit a high - pitched sound , not heard by humans , when they are triggered by the movement of an animal			2
one , called @entity347 , from @entity348 , also incorporates built - in strobe led lights , so for less than £ 30 you can have your garden lit up and unheard alarm bells ring as soon as @entity23 puts a pad on to your lawn			1
these devices do seem to deter cats and may be effective against badgers , especially to start with			2
however , @entity23 is likely to get used to them , or put up with them if he ’s hungry enough			2
change things around badgers are very cautious , so they can be deterred by unusual objects or changes			1
a security light coming on can be effective			0
a scarecrow in a rustling mac could also work but might need repositioning daily			0
reflective strips of plastic , wind chimes and toy windmills could make @entity23 think twice , too			1
there is a theory that the vibrations from windmills drive grubs deeper into the lawn , making them less accessible — but i think @entity23 will just dig deeper to get to them			2
@entity382 obstacles being creatures of habit , badgers like sticking to their traditional pathways			1
@entity388 mesh — steel wire grids available from builders ’ merchants — can be tried to plug holes in fences , with more of it laid flat to stop @entity23 digging under them			2
one friend used a large boulder that he and his mate heaved with great difficulty across a badger run			0
the next day he found it rolled aside			0
electric fencing could protect a defined area , but may require a licence and can be costly .			0

october rain has softened the soil giving badgers better access to worms
many are taking *advantage* of change , digging up ground wherever they go
with 800,000 of the animals in the @entity66 , urban areas also effected by problem
but there are tricks which can prevent them from ruining your lawn
chillies , *electronic* gadgets , wind chimes and obstacles are all *recommended*
