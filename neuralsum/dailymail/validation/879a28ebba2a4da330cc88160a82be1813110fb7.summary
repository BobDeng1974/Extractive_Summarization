just three drinks a day can be enough to cause liver cancer , according to an extensive review of global research			1
the increase in risk per 10g of alcohol consumed – around one alcoholic drink – is about 4 per cent , says the @entity8			1
as a result three or more drinks pose a significant cancer risk , it adds			0
the review also found a strong association between obesity and liver cancer , as well as evidence that drinking coffee can protect against the disease			1
the risk of liver cancer is increased by 4 per cent for every 10g of alcohol consumed , meaning three or more drinks a day pose a significant cancer risk , a research review has claimed the @entity8 's continuous update project reviewed global research into the relationship between diet , weight and physical activity , and liver cancer			1
in all , 34 studies were analysed covering 8.2million people of whom more than 24,500 had liver cancer			1
previous research by the project has shown alcohol to be strongly linked with a range of cancers , including liver			0
the @entity8 recommends women should try to limit their alcohol intake to one drink per day and men to two			0
@entity46 , director of @entity47 , said : ' around three or more drinks per day can be enough to cause liver cancer			2
until now we were uncertain about the amount of alcohol likely to lead to liver cancer			2
but the research reviewed in this report is strong enough to be more specific			0
' in 2012 , there were 4,703 cases of liver cancer in the @entity58			2
the report estimates that nearly a quarter of cases could be prevented if people kept a healthy weight and did not drink			0
@entity8 reviewed 34 studies involving more than 8.2million people in order to reach its findings on alcohol , weight , physical activity and liver cancer although the research found strong evidence that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of the disease , the report did not recommend the amount that should be drunk			1
professor sir @entity79 , chairman of the @entity80 , said : ' the findings from this study further demonstrate the urgent need for mandatory health warnings on alcohol products			0
' dr @entity86 , medical adviser for alcohol education charity drinkaware , said the research revealed a worrying link with obesity , but some people had a ' blind spot ' when it comes to the calories in alcohol			0
she added : ' to help reduce the risk of getting alcohol - related liver cancer , it is best to drink within the lower - risk guidelines of 2 - 3 units a day for women , that 's a 175ml glass of 13 per cent wine , or 3 - 4 units a day for men , a pint and a half of 4 per cent beer			1
' sir @entity110 , @entity111 professor of the public understanding of risk , @entity109 , said that while the increase in risk of liver cancer per 10g of alcohol consumed was about 4 per cent , that level of alcohol was ' extremely unlikely to cause cancer ' , especially as the report says the increase in risk only starts at levels above 5.5 units a day			1
he added : ' liver cancer is rare : about one in 100 men and one in 200 women get it			2
so if you already drink a lot , and then drink even more , your risk goes up a small amount			0
' @entity136 , professor of cancer epidemiology , @entity109 , said the evidence appeared to show three drinks a day led to ' a very small ' absolute increase in risk from ten in 1,000 to 12 in 1,000 for men and 5 in 1,000 to 5.6 in 1,000 for women			0
he added : ' even though the data specifically related to primary liver cancer do not support the recommendation to limit alcohol intake to one drink a day for women and two for men , there are plenty of other reasons to support the recommendations			2

just three alcoholic drinks a day could be enough to cause liver cancer
research review found the risk increased by 4 per cent for every 10g
*experts* also found a strong association between obesity and liver cancer
