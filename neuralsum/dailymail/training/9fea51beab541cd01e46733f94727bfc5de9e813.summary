by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 07:51 est , 22 september 2012 an oil painting bought at a golf club auction for £ 3,700 is believed to be a long lost work by famous painter @entity4 worth up to £ 20million			1
convinced the small painting was done by @entity9 ’s most loved painter , art investor @entity5 made sure he had the winning bid at the auction eight years ago			1
now historians and scientists are backing up his claim after tests dated the oil on panel to 1805 and a handwriting expert verified the signature on the work was @entity4 ’s			1
@entity21 lost @entity4 : an art investor bought this oil on panel entitled @entity24 at a golf club auction for less than £ 4,000 which experts now believe is a @entity4 painting worth up to £ 20million art insurers @entity28 are said to have put the multi-million pound valuation on the masterpiece , entitled @entity31 in a @entity32			1
mr @entity5 came across the 13in by 10in painting at the auction in @entity36 , @entity37 in 2004 where amazingly it was even catalogued as a @entity4 , even though it had a reserve price of just £ 700 to £ 900			1
he said : ‘ i eventually had to go up to £ 3,700 , four times the estimate , so there must have been some others in the audience who suspected it was seriously valuable			1
same @entity4 time : scientific dating tests found that the mystery painting was from the same year @entity4 painted his famous masterpiece @entity51 , pictured ‘ i always back my judgement			1
‘ my mother was an antiquarian bookseller , and she used to take me to the @entity55 regularly , so i have always been interested in art. ’ scientific tests date the painting , inscribed on the panel along with the title , from the same year @entity4 painted his famous @entity51			1
@entity4 is considered to be the artist who made landscape paintings as important as historic paintings			2
and while he is renowned for his oil paintings , @entity4 is also considered one of the greatest masters of @entity9 watercolour landscape painting			1
@entity9 's best : @entity4 , pictured in self - portrait , is considered to be the artist who made landscape paintings as important as historic paintings @entity4 scholar dr @entity71 is among six experts who will present support evidence at a conference at the @entity75 in south @entity76 next wednesday			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ @entity4 spent a lot of time in @entity78 and i believe he painted it at a spot between @entity78 and @entity81 , funnily enough an area where @entity83 used to pick up a lot of his men to go to sea			1
‘ it is of great historical importance because we believe @entity4 gave the painting to his great friend the @entity91 , who was with him at his death and became his executor			1
’ mr @entity5 believes that after @entity96 ’s death the painting was sold in 1860 , passing through several hands until disappearing from public view , until now			1
dr @entity71 said it is unlikely to be a fake for many reasons			0
he said : ‘ it seems unlikely to be a fake on various grounds			0
no one appears to have made any money out of it , so what would have been the point ? ‘ it is an oil painting as well , and most of the @entity4 fakes have been of his watercolours			1
and tests on the pigments used date it to about the right time to make it authentic			0
‘ this does not prove a particular artist was responsible but it helps to rule out forgeries from a later time			0
‘ it would be nice to know a little bit more about the history of it			0
it may have been in an earlier @entity76 sale , but i have no idea who owned it before @entity5			2
’ ‘ it is often quite difficult to find these things out but i would say on the balance of probabilities it is a @entity4			2
’ six experts including @entity4 scholar dr @entity71 will present evidence backing up the claim at a conference at the @entity75 , pictured an 18 page report by @entity145 , to be presented at the conference , says : ‘ work thus far has not revealed any features wholly inconsistent with the hypothesis that the painting was executed by @entity4 in 1805			1
’ weight of evidence : dr @entity71 said ' the balance of probabilities it is a @entity4 ' dr @entity71 said there was ‘ historical significance ’ of a painting listed as missing in @entity156 and @entity158 ’s 1980s study of @entity4 works			2
he said : ‘ it belongs to a group of small works which are neglected			0
all the concentration tends to be on the big works exhibited at the @entity164			0
‘ @entity4 painted on this small scale not for exhibition but more personal reasons			0
‘ @entity4 gave the works to friends , and most have remained in private collections			0
’ proving the painting ’s authenticity might prove to be less straightforward , with more than one expert giving reasons to doubt it was a @entity4 work			2
dr @entity71 said one dismissed it because it was on a panel			0
he said : ‘ that is an absurd reason			0
@entity4 painted other things on panel			2
it is for others to give reasons why it ’s not by @entity4			0
the weight of the evidence is that it is			0
‘ it is an oil painting , which is partly what makes it interesting and rarer			0
watercolours do turn up quite frequently			0
’ the record price for a @entity4 work is £ 29.7million when @entity196 was sold in 2010			2
art and antiques dealer @entity197 recently convinced leading art authorities that he was in possession of a lost @entity4 which could be worth about £ 4million			1
