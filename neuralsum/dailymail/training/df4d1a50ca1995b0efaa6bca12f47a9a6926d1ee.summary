what a match we have in store at the @entity3 on sunday			1
both @entity4 and @entity5 have everything to play for , with qualification to the knock - out stage of the @entity9 up for grabs			1
it is remarkable that , along with @entity13 , all three teams can finish first , second or third so the group is on a knife - edge			1
it is still in the hands of @entity13 as , if they win in @entity20 , they win the group and @entity4 and @entity5 are playing for second			1
but stranger things have happened and @entity20 look like they have improved under @entity24 , so they ’ll give @entity13 a real challenge			1
@entity26 could be the key for @entity5 against @entity4 in the @entity9 on sunday both @entity4 and @entity5 know that a win is vital if they are to have any chance of progressing and things would be even better if the win came with a bonus point as well			1
those circumstances mean we should have a cracker of a game , with both teams throwing everything at each other			0
@entity4 are extremely confident after their amazing performance last week in @entity13 which gave them a bonus - point win , but @entity5 had a good result last week too against @entity20 — albeit without getting the bonus point			1
@entity4 go into this game as clear favourites for a number of reasons — they look to be at full - strength whilst @entity5 have severe problems in the back row , they are playing at home and have momentum on their side			1
there are some fantastic match - ups throughout the teams that will go a long way to determining the outcome of the match			2
here are just three : @entity61 v @entity26 without doubt , if both stay fit , these two will start for their respective countries at stand - off in the @entity66			1
@entity67 was immense last week , mixing his game up beautifully , kicking well when he needed to and seeing when things were on to attack , even when deep within his own 22			0
they are different physically , @entity26 is much taller , but they are very similar in how they play the game			1
@entity26 faces a battle for supremacy against @entity4 fly half @entity61 both kick and pass well and they are both very brave in defence ; they both attack the line at pace , too , which creates so much space out wide for the outside backs			1
they love to attack , have good awareness when things are on or not and they will have a go			0
this is a big test for @entity26 in his young career because he needs to try and get the upper hand over @entity67 , no small task the way the @entity96 is playing			1
@entity67 can be put under pressure though , the big @entity99 sides like @entity100 and @entity101 have really asked questions of him and he has not coped well			2
what does not help @entity26 is that his back row is decimated and they have a hooker playing openside			2
back three i have bundled the back three together because all three match - ups are good			0
the wingers — @entity113 and @entity114 against @entity115 and @entity116 van der @entity112 — all share many of the same qualities ; size , power , and , above all , pace			0
@entity115 ( left ) skipping past @entity122 's @entity121 in their clash last weekend they all work very hard off the ball as well , popping up on the other wing and usually being in the right place at the right time			0
the @entity5 wingers just shade it when it comes to form , @entity116 scored a hat trick last week and @entity133 has been on fire all season			2
i have high expectations of the full - back contest between @entity139 against @entity140			0
i am a big fan of @entity139 , who glides across the ground effortlessly but with genuine pace			0
give him space and he can be devastating			0
@entity140 announced this week that he is leaving at the end of the season to join @entity147 so he will want to justify this by playing well			0
he has been more of a winger recently but he likes the space that full - back gives you and he can have a huge impact on this game			0
back row i do n’t think there is much between the two sides in general , apart from in the back row			0
@entity5 have been devastated by injury here and it is such a shame			2
i would have loved to have seen @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 take the field but all are injured along with @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
this means that @entity169 are fielding a second row , a hooker and a centre in the back row ! @entity169 head coach talks to the press ahead of his side 's forthcoming clash with @entity4 @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 would not have expected to play together in such a big game but they are and they will need to produce miracles against a very good @entity4 back row			2
at openside @entity187 was brilliant last week in @entity13 , running great support lines and being strong in defence , and this is the one position that might settle this game			2
@entity180 is a good player but he is a hooker , not an openside			0
my concern for @entity5 is that @entity187 could dominate things in attack and defence because he is a wily old fox and he could get to @entity26 in defence with no recognised back row to defend him .			1

@entity5 face @entity4 for a place in knock - out stage of @entity9
three sides in @entity208 *including* @entity13 can still qualify
@entity61 v @entity26 will be a key battle at the @entity3 on sunday
