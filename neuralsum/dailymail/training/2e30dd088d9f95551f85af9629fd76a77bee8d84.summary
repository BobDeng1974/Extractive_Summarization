these issues can not be used to diminish in any way the seriousness of any allegations against him			2
’ the woman at the centre of the allegation , who is a @entity3 supporter , told police she had consensual sex with @entity2 in august 2010 but woke the following morning to find he was having sex with her again , without her consent and without using a condom			0
mr @entity9 said this could not be rape , as the pair had had sex and were ‘ already in the sex game ’			1
he later defended his comments , saying he did not believe the accusations against @entity2 would have led to rape prosecution in @entity59			2
what occurred is not rape as most people understand it			2
’ mr @entity9 faced a barrage of criticism after rape charities reacted with fury to his comments			1

’ @entity19 mp @entity9 said the accusations against @entity2 do no amount to rape businessman @entity85 wrote on the social networking site : ‘ @entity9 entitled to speak mind , like all off @entity88 has no factual detail of the alleged crime committed by @entity2 , so should shut his trap			2

’ a lawyer for @entity2 ’s alleged victims yesterday called his ‘ absurd ’ attempts to avoid answering rape accusations an abuse of international asylum rules			1

he should be brought to justice in @entity101			1
