@entity14 was taken off life support on july 24 , 2009 and died the following day			1
@entity14 , who died in 2009 , was found to have ' moderately severe rickets ' though a doctor believes that some of the injures to the four - month - old were non-accidental @entity21 , prosecuting , told jurors : ' it is the @entity24 's case that those responsible for his death are his parents			1
' clinical investigation into the cause of his collapse revealed a number of injuries - some recent and others pre-dating his admission to hospital by quite some time			0
' these injuries suggested to doctors treating him that @entity14 had sustained them as a result of either a shaking or shaking / impact assault			2
' @entity14 had been born a normal baby when his mother was 16 and his father 19			2
on july 22 , 2009 , he was admitted as an emergency to @entity47 and placed on life support			0
within hours , @entity14 's condition deteriorated and he was transferred to @entity50			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , accused of murdering their son and causing or allowing his death , are pictured arriving at the @entity10 despite efforts to save his life , he was considered so severely brain damaged that his condition was ' incompatible with life ' , said @entity58			1
the couple denied that @entity14 had been injured in any way to their knowledge , but staff at @entity50 found multiple fractures including to his arms , leg and skull			1
he was severely brain - damaged and had haemorrhaging in his retinas			0
on july 24 , 2009 , doctors decided to take the baby off life support			0
miss @entity58 told the court : ' it was explained that life support would be withdrawn but if @entity14 stopped breathing , he would not be resuscitated			1
@entity75 gave birth to @entity14 when she was 16 ' @entity6 asked the consultant paediatric intensivist dr @entity77 how big the skull fracture was and if fractures could be dated			1
' @entity14 died the following day			2
as part of tests carried out after @entity14 's death , professor @entity80 found that he had been suffering from rickets , a disease which causes bones to be weaker			1
miss @entity58 said : ' it was quite clear that @entity14 , despite his healthy appearance to most of the health professionals who he saw , had moderately severe rickets			2
' she added : ' it has to be borne in mind that @entity14 had a greater risk of bone fracturing than any normal , well - nourished child			0
' prof @entity80 believed that , while many of the baby 's fractures could be linked to rickets , some injuries were not			0
he argued that fractures to the top of both of @entity14 's humerus bones and his femur were more likely to have been caused by non-accidental injury , as was the skull fracture			1
in his opinion the injuries were around seven to 14 days old			0
he also noted haemorrhaging in the skull fracture , which he said could suggest a repeat injury before death , miss @entity58 told the jury			0
@entity14 and @entity75 deny having caused any injury to their baby and the defence maintains that the seizures and fractures were linked to rickets			2
meningitis and encephalitis could also not be ruled out as possible causes of death			0
