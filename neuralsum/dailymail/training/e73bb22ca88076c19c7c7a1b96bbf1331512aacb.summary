@entity0 have been something of a forgotten club in recent seasons			1
relegated from the @entity5 in 2009 , chairman @entity4 reinvested parachute payments only for the team never to take flight			0
indeed , they have remained grounded in the nowhere regions of the second tier			0
@entity0 take on @entity12 in the @entity14 third round on tuesday ... and they are up for a shock with three wins on the spin – taking them to within three points of top – they are one of the country ’s form sides and , on tuesday evening , they will remind a national audience of their existence with a televised trip to @entity26 in the @entity14			1
so what ’s going on down by the @entity28 ? here , @entity29 takes a closer look … the past five seasons sound forgettable , what happened ? it ’s more of a case of what failed to happen			0
@entity36 should have gone in the wake of relegation but @entity4 kept faith			0
it was a mistake and by october @entity41 was installed with the remit of taking @entity0 back to the @entity5			1
and so began the @entity44 revolution			0
they may have voted against independence last week , but @entity41 set about creating an independent @entity44 state on @entity48			0
by the end of the 2010 winter window five of his compatriots had arrived at significant cost			0
but @entity41 never seemed happy back in the dugout and he was replaced after a year by fan favourite @entity55			0
neither @entity36 or @entity55 managed to bring success back to @entity0 @entity41 brought in a @entity44 legion but also struggled at the @entity28 his popularity bought him time – too much of it , in fact			2
for @entity55 remained in charge for three laborious years during which the club stalled			0
enter , last november , @entity64			2
i remember him from @entity66 with @entity67 ? we ’re sure he ’ll be thrilled by such recollection … but yes , while @entity67 were winning three @entity71 trophies around the turn of the millennium , @entity64 was an unsung stalwart in defence			1
he went on to manage @entity75 before returning to @entity67 as assistant to @entity77			1
@entity64 mixed it with the very best as a player , here playing for @entity67 against @entity81 @entity64 with @entity77 , then @entity67 manager , during a @entity71 match at @entity83 in 2010 and so to @entity0 , how has he done ? he may lack the charisma of his close pal @entity85 , but @entity64 is proving a canny coach			1
@entity0 won six from eight at the back end of last season to suggest his influence was beginning to take hold and a busy summer followed during which the @entity93 stamped his mark on the squad			1
how busy was the summer then ? well , total turnover amounted to a staggering 27 , broken down by ; seven signings , five loans in , 11 released or sold and four loans out			0
this , then , is @entity64 ’s team			1
the @entity93 has changed the team dramatically but is beginning to pick up points in the championship how have they done ? they certainly do n’t do draws and are one of only two sides in the country not to tie a game this season			2
three wins from three – the latest an emphatic 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity114 – has lifted them to play - off territory and @entity64 believes that is where they should remain , rather than play catch - up like they did last term only to fall short in 12th			2
who are the stars ? who are n’t the stars ? for be it new signings or those from previous regimes , @entity0 are bouncing all over the park			2
@entity132 forward @entity131 has been the pick of the summer arrivals			2
@entity64 worked with the 24 - year - old at international youth level and his £ 2.7million acquisition is proving something of a coup			1
the silky @entity93 has netted five times already , his latest effort a sumptuous scoop in the demolition of @entity114			0
@entity131 could prove to be a snip at £ 2.7million , he is already banging in the goals captain @entity146 has been the main man this season , already scoring seven goals from midfield but it is captain @entity146 who has been the main man this season			1
if he ’s not scoring belters from 30 yards then , well , he ’s scoring belters from 25 yards			0
the former @entity156 and @entity157 schemer has smashed seven goals to already better his tally from last term			0
his honesty and endeavour from the centre of midfield will be the heartbeat to any potential promotion push			0
but @entity0 have options all over the pitch and team selection is a welcome headache for @entity64 right now , certainly in attack where @entity131 is competing with @entity171 forward @entity172 , @entity174 loanee @entity173 , @entity175 and @entity176			1
they also have the chairman 's nephew at the back , @entity181 under 21 defender @entity182			0
what about that connection with @entity174 ? yes , @entity64 has made full use of his relationship with @entity77 to bring in @entity188 goal machine @entity173 , defender @entity189 and goalkeeper @entity190 on loan			1
but it was @entity194 loanee @entity193 who caught the eye most impressively at the weekend , coming in for his debut and putting in a combative yet classy display			0
@entity173 is one of many talented @entity174 loanees who have been brought in by @entity64 so can they shock @entity12 ? yes			1
they ’ve won their last three away from home , are in free - scoring form and @entity64 has generated a healthy competition whereby those who come in will be desperate to impress			1
@entity0 – forgotten no more			2
@entity207 ' struggling @entity12 side could be in for a shock in the @entity14 at @entity26			1

@entity0 *kicking* on this season under @entity64
@entity64 worked with @entity77 at @entity67 and has built on that
@entity131 could be the signing of the @entity215 season at £ 2.7m
@entity146 has netted seven goals from midfield
@entity0 are a team in form so @entity12 could be in for a shock
