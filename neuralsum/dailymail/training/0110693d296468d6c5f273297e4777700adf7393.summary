bra tycoon @entity1 is embroiled in a row with university chiefs over building plans next door to her £ 1million dream home			1
she is pictured here ( in yellow ) at @entity36 last week self - made multi-millionaire @entity1 bought the converted property off - plan in @entity20 's upmarket @entity19 area ( pictured ) last year after splitting from her husband @entity21 she opened the doors of the home for a photoshoot with @entity40 and described it as her ' new beginning '			1
however , the 42 - year - old businesswoman was aghast at the thought of ' anti-social ' university students becoming her neighbours or attending events at the house			1
in a strongly - worded letter to planning officials at @entity52 , she said : ' i am replying to strongly object to this application			0
' having looked at the plans , i object as i having paid in the region of £ 1 million for my home , i do not under any circumstances want the adjacent property being used by or for university students			1
' i would also like to object on the grounds of potential for anti-social behaviour which , despite the best intentions , can not be avoided where student accommodation is concerned			1
' i believe university students to be unsuitable tenants for this area , and would result in a loss of amenity and could also have an adverse impact on the conservation area			0
' despite @entity1 ’s concerns , the university has previously said the house ’s living accommodation will mainly be used by its principal sir @entity74 and not by students			1
the letter @entity1 wrote to planning officers objection to the university 's proposal however , it will be used to host corporate events and business engagements			2
@entity1 said this would impinge on her privacy and cause traffic problems in an area where parking is ' virtually impossible '			2
she added : ' i value my privacy and believe that an increased flow of traffic in the area as a result of this dwelling and its outlined function would eliminate this privacy , which is one of the main reasons i purchased a home in this area in the first place			0
' also , with this new dwelling there will be a large increase in the number of people and , therefore , vehicles associated with that			0
@entity52 are due to make a decision on the planning application later this month ' the proposed exit and entrance route to the flats is already overcrowded with vehicles and parking is virtually impossible as it is			0
' @entity1 , who is the only person who has objected to the plans , finished her letter by stating : ' i imagine you will receive many similar objections from other residents living nearby and i trust you will refuse this application on the basis that they most definitely are not in keeping with planning regulations in this area			2
' the university ’s application states it wants to use the building as a ' university residence with guest accommodation and associated university function use '			0
@entity1 's previous house in south @entity130 , which she bought with her then husband @entity21 six years ago bosses at the institution were criticised when it emerged they had spent around £ 1 million buying the five - storey townhouse last year at a time of public spending restraint			1

she said : ' i work away a lot and i love coming home to it			0
' in 2010 , @entity1 was at the centre of a row with neighbours over plans to extend her former family home in @entity153 , @entity130			1
five residents objected to her proposals to add a sauna , gym and bar to the six - bedroomed property			2
one said the development would ' completely dwarf ' the rest of the street but it was given the go - ahead by planners			0
a spokesman @entity11 said : ' this is a matter for the planning authority			0
' @entity52 are due to make a decision on the planning application later this month .			0
