by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:13 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:23 est , 23 december 2013 new grandmother princess @entity3 got into the @entity7 spirit early this weekend as she headed out for a festive lunch with her family			1
dressed warmly in shearling and fur , princess @entity10 was joined by husband prince @entity3 , daughter @entity13 , 32 , and son @entity14 , 34 at the appropriately named @entity16 restaurant in @entity17			1
the foursome spent almost two hours inside the exclusive @entity20 haunt before heading back out into the chilly afternoon air			0
princess @entity3 wore a brown leather sheepskin jacket with a fur trim around the collar and a matching brown leather handbag , and appeared to be carrying a paper bag when she left the @entity17 restaurant after their meal , lord @entity29 held the restaurant door open for his sister and parents the family appeared to leave their personalised black @entity37 car on double yellow lines for over 1 and half hours but more than a few eyebrows were raised when it was discovered that the royal couple had chosen to leave their black @entity37 on double yellow lines for more than an hour while tucking into an @entity46 lunch at the restaurant			1
it is n't the first time that princess @entity3 , 68 , has ruffled feathers in recent weeks			1
10 days ago , she launched an impassioned defence of her right to complain about being made to pay rent on her lavish @entity56 apartment and claimed she and her husband , cousin to the @entity60 , lived in ‘ austere economic times '			0
speaking to the @entity62 , she revealed how she and husband @entity63 , 71 , have been forced to embrace austerity along with the rest of the country , eating all their meals at home since dining in restaurants has become too much of an extravagance , and flying by budget airline @entity72			0
but it seems her austere new lifestyle does n't extend to the @entity7 period , with the royal pair seemingly happy to bend the ‘ no dining out ’ rule			0
prince @entity3 walked by his daughter 's side after the meal , laughing and talking and the royal couple were then seen pointing at an antique shop window at an item which had taken their eye after hugs and kisses , lord @entity29 walked in one direction and the rest of the family were seen driving off in the @entity37 the intimate luncheon was kept low key , with just the family in attendance and with no security present			2
during the meal , the family tucked into @entity46 classics such as cuttlefish risotto and roast wild boar with rosemary , garlic and olive oil served with swiss chard			0
for the lunch , the princess wore a brown sheepskin jacket with a fur collar , and a matching brown leather handbag which she paired with loose black slacks and a jade necklace			2
the rest of the family also dressed down for the gathering , with the exception of @entity63 who wore a pair of bright green trousers			0
as the family left the restaurant , princess @entity3 was seen holding a @entity16 branded bag , ( taking home some leftovers in an attempt to save a few more pennies ? ) , although that did n't stop her from eyeing up an interesting piece on display in the window of a nearby antique shop			1
after the lunch , @entity79 and princess @entity133 returned to their car with daughter @entity13 , 32 after a flurry of hugs and kisses , lord @entity29 walked in one direction while the rest of the family piled into the @entity37			1
although it is not yet known whether the family will be joining the @entity60 and the rest of the @entity147 for @entity148 ’s first @entity7 at the @entity150 estate , a large number of @entity144 are said to be attending this year and an appearance seems likely			0
if the couple do attend , the princess certainly wo n’t have any problems finding stocking fillers , as she is currently is promoting her first novel , @entity60 of @entity157 , the first in a trilogy .			2
