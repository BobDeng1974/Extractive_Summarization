' pernicious effect ' : mp @entity1 says youngsters will grow up with a warped idea of relationships thanks to porn an impassioned attack on the ‘ pernicious effect ’ of online porn was delivered by the culture secretary yesterday			1
@entity1 warned that young boys who see explicit images risk growing up with a warped idea of how to treat girls			1
she demanded that teachers , parents and internet giants do more to prevent children from accidentally viewing such images			1
and she denounced the culture that has led to an explosion of x-rated net pictures , saying : ‘ too often in the past we have been happy to say “ anything goes ”			0
well – it does n’t			0
’ the @entity26 ’s intervention came as the prime minister ’s adviser on the sexualisation of children , @entity31 , said it was never too early to start educating youngsters about the online dangers			1
‘ people say primary school is too young			0
no : babies can swipe @entity41			0
you ca n’t , in some ways , start young enough , ’ mrs @entity31 told a fringe meeting at the @entity36 conference in @entity37			0
and mrs @entity1 , a mother of three , stressed that ‘ responsible parents ’ needed to speak to children earlier about the effect internet porn had on their understanding of relationships			1
charities say children as young as 11 are becoming addicted to internet porn , giving them ‘ unrealistic expectations ’ of sex			1
they also say it is encouraging boys to grow up viewing girls merely as sex objects			0
counsellors at @entity59 also report a surge in calls from youngsters traumatised after seeing adult images online			2
teaching unions have called for pupils to be taught about porn from the age of ten so they can protect themselves from stumbling across adult images			2
mrs @entity1 did not suggest an age , but said governors should think about whether it should be tackled in their schools			1
danger : a third of people who sent ' sexts ' said they went to people they had met only online , while 15 per cent had sent images to total strangers ( posed by model ) she said : ‘ there is guidance available to schools in terms of the way they can help young people navigate their responsibilities in this area			2
i am fearful of the result if we do n’t take action particularly in terms of young boys ’ attitudes to girls , their relationships , what ’s seen as a normal relationship between two young people			0
’ it is the first time the @entity26 , who is in charge of internet policy , has spoken out over school lessons on porn			2
while groups such as the @entity111 are in favour of such a move , some believe it could have the opposite effect of introducing children to adult material for the first time			2
but mrs @entity1 said many schools would naturally want to ‘ ensure the children in their care understand the importance of not accessing material like that when they are underage , and also the pernicious effect of pornography in their lives long - term ’			1
she also said imposing filters on internet porn would not be enough – children had to be taught to use the web responsibly			2
a spokesman for the @entity111 said : ' online videos , some of them violent and degrading , are now just a few clicks away for many young people '			0
file picture special adviser mrs @entity31 , @entity36 mp for @entity137 , called on education secretary @entity138 to bring in new statutory guidance for secondary schools about how teach children about online porn			1
‘ teenage boys send teenage girls naked selfies [ self - taken photos ] and teenage girls send them , ’ she said			0
‘ there are so many things wrong with that , and part of the problem is that children do n’t understand that giving away digital identities is something that can stay with you for ever			0
’ the @entity157 has been campaigning for an automatic block on online porn , with over- 18s able to access adult material only following a strict age verification check			1
in the summer @entity162 announced a compromise ‘ default on ’ solution , under which all families will be asked whether a filter should be applied			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity111 said : ‘ it ’s absolutely essential that young people are educated about the dangers of pornography			0
online videos , some of them violent and degrading , are now just a few clicks away for many young people			0
‘ and children as young as 11 or 12 tell us that they are using porn to learn about sex			1
we must speak to young people about what healthy , meaningful and respectful relationships are before their views are warped by the prism of online porn			1

@entity1 said parents must talk to children about dangers of online porn
it comes as charity warns that 11 - year - olds are ' addicted '
@entity197 added that schools must consider educating youngsters about threat
