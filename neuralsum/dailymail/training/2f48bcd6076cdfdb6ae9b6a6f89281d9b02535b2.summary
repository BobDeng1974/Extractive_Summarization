the former @entity7 ( @entity7 ) chief ’s ‘ central pivot ’ status in a well organised vice ring is what has led to him being prosecuted			1
judges in @entity15 , northern @entity16 , have announced that the 64 - year - old will stand trial for pimping , and he faces up to 10 years in prison			1
he admits attending swingers ' parties over many years , but insists he did not know the women were prostitutes			2
legal documents suggests that @entity2 was fully aware that ‘ the girls ’ were being paid the equivalent of thousands of pounds for their services			0
he even made an apartment available for some of the orgies – an act which was ‘ a material act of pimping ’ , according to the judges			1
at least two prostitutes have told investigators that they were paid to attend the parties , and that all those attending knew this			0
judges have dismissed defence claims that all of those attending the parties were consensual adults who did not exchange money			1
separated : @entity2 with his wife @entity48 , pictured outside @entity50 criminal court in 2011 , at the time of the alleged offences @entity2 has said that he did not know what any of the women did ‘ because they had their clothes off ’ and all looked the same			1
@entity58 , @entity2 ’s lawyer , meanwhile insists that @entity2 is at the centre of a ‘ relentless ’ campaign to smear his name , and that he would use his trial to ‘ denounce the absurdity and abnormality of this aggravated pimping complaint ’			0
women selling themselves for sex is not illegal in @entity16 , but aggravated pimping is , and carries a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine equivalent to 1.2 million pounds			1
accuser : @entity71 maintained her claims the she was the victim of a ' violent , sadistic attack , ' despite criminal charges being dropped @entity2 is now formally under ‘ judicial control ’ , which means he can not leave @entity16 and has to report to police regularly			1
it is the latest in a string of legal problems for @entity2 , who once faced accusations that he tried to rape women in both @entity82 and @entity83			0
in 2011 @entity2 was accused by @entity71 , a @entity82 chamber maid , of trying to rape her			2

@entity71 then sued @entity2 , but the two sides reached a financial settlement late last year , the details of which have never been disclosed			0
last october , a @entity16 prosecutor dropped a criminal investigation connecting @entity2 to a possible gang rape in @entity95 a @entity97 woman withdrew her allegations , and said she would not press charges , despite initially insisting she had been attacked by @entity2			1

public affair : the affair between disgraced former @entity7 boss @entity2 and tv executive @entity112 became public knowledge when they arrived at @entity115 together sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

judges believe @entity121 played a pivotal role in the sex parties
he will be tried on charges of pimping with a well organised vice ring
he was appealing the *decision* to charge him of the crime
but judges in @entity15 determined he should be tried by a criminal court
he was also accused of raping a hotel *chambermaid* in may 2011 in the @entity139
although the charges were dropped , the case *dashed* his hopes of winning the @entity16 *presidency*
