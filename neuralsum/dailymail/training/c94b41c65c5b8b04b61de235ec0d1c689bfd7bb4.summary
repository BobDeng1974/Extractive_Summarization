the mother , who was cleared of killing her daughter in 2011 , was facing fresh questions from attorneys for @entity13 , who is suing @entity14 for defamation			1
@entity13 says the similarity of her name to @entity4 meant that some people thought she was to blame for @entity4 's disappearance			1
hiding : @entity4 , pictured in march last year , has been seen little since she was acquitted of her daughter 's murder in 2011 but @entity14 insisted to @entity13 's lawyers that @entity4 was a real person and she had not made up the name as a code for the prescription drug @entity28			1
in the contentious january 23 deposition , @entity14 claimed that @entity30 was someone she 'd last seen in 2007 and who had baby - sat @entity4 just once			1
‘ i met her at @entity33 in 2006 … through a mutual friend , ’ @entity14 said , adding : ‘ we were friends a little over a year			2
’ but she admitted that the real @entity4 did not kidnap @entity4 , as she initially claimed after disappearance			2
miss @entity13 sued in 2008 after @entity14 claimed that a similarly - named nanny had kidnapped two - year - old @entity4			1
authorities ultimately determined the nanny did n't exist and the girl was dead , although @entity14 was eventually acquitted of murder in @entity4 's death after a high - profile trial			1
court battle : @entity13 argues her lawsuit should survive the bankruptcy because @entity14 was ' willful and malicious ' in damaging her reputation in the contentious january 23 deposition , @entity14 claimed that @entity30 , the nanny she claimed had kidnapped her daughter , was a real person on july 5 , 2011 , the jury found @entity52 not guilty of first degree murder , aggravated child abuse , and aggravated manslaughter of a child , but guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer			1
the not guilty murder verdict was greeted with public outrage , and was both attacked and defended by media and legal commentators who complained that the jury had misunderstood the meaning of reasonable doubt			0
during the deposition , @entity14 admitted she made up the story about dropping her daughter @entity4 off with the fictional babysitter at the @entity73 apartments in @entity74 , @entity75 , the same address as the woman suing her			1
and she admitted to lying to the police about it			0
but when @entity13 ' lawyer @entity80 pressed and asked what happened to @entity4 and whether she knew her child was alive or dead at the time she claimed to have dropped her off with the fictional babysitter , @entity14 threatened to walk out			1
‘ at the advice of counsel , i decline to answer questions about my daughter			0
if you ask me again , i will walk out of this room , ’ she said			0
a transcript of the two hour deposition was filed in federal court on tuesday			0
@entity80 expressed skepticism of @entity14 's claim that the nanny was a real person			2
‘ now , is there any way in the world that you could suggest to me that i might find this person to see if she ever existed ? ’ @entity80 asked @entity14			2
@entity14 replied : ‘ i do n't know if you could or not , sir			2
’ @entity80 reminded @entity14 that @entity101 said at trial that she had difficulty telling the truth : ‘ do you have a significant problem with not telling the truth ? ’ victim : @entity4 went missing in june 2008 and was found in a wooded area near her grandparents house six months later ‘ no , sir , i do not , ’ @entity14 replied			1
she also denied that the nickname ‘ @entity4 ’ was a reference to the knockout drug @entity28 , and that she had ever given drugs of any kind to her daughter			2
the deposition was part of the ongoing legal wrangling surrounding @entity14 's chapter 7 bankruptcy			1
@entity13 argues her lawsuit should survive the bankruptcy because @entity14 was ‘ willful and malicious ’ in damaging her reputation			1
at the crux of the suit are comments @entity14 made to her mother , @entity129 , during a jailhouse visit			2
@entity14 allegedly said she had n't ruled out @entity30 as a suspect , information her mother relayed to reporters			0
@entity14 said she did n't authorize her parents to represent her in the media : ' i had zero control over that			0
i was in jail , mr. @entity80			0
i had no control over anything			0
' as the deposition neared its end , @entity14 emphatically said she never blamed the woman suing her for @entity4 's disappearance			1
' that 's never been the case and that will never be the truth			0

you can ask a hundred more ridiculous questions			0
i 'm not going to answer them , ' she said			0
' i 'm done here			0
