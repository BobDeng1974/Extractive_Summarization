by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 21:59 est , 5 may 2012 the inhabitants of the @entity2 - east of @entity3 - are very dark - skinned - but have puzzled scientists for decades with their blond hair			1
now a genetic study has found that the islanders have a ' homegrown ' gene that gives them blond hair - and it 's different from the one in @entity10			1
‘ its frequency is between 5 and 10 percent across the @entity2 , which is about the same as where i 'm from , ’ said study author @entity11 , phd , who was born in @entity12			2
a genetic study has found that the islanders have a ' homegrown ' gene that gives them blond hair - and it 's different from the one in @entity10 ' its frequency is between 5 and 10 percent across the @entity2 , which is about the same as where i 'm from , ' said study author @entity11 , phd , who was born in @entity12 gathering the data , accomplished in 2009 by @entity24 and co-first author @entity25 , phd , was more difficult			1
much of the @entity2 is undeveloped , without roads , electricity or telephones globally , blond hair is rare , occurring with substantial frequency only in northern @entity10 and in @entity31 , which includes the @entity2 and its neighbors			1
many assumed the blond hair of @entity35 was the result of gene flow — a trait passed on by @entity10 explorers , traders and others who visited in the preceding centuries			1
the islanders themselves give several possible explanations for its presence - they generally chalked it up to sun exposure , or a diet rich in fish , say the researchers			1
‘ within a week we had our initial result			0
it was such a striking signal pointing to a single gene — a result you could hang your hat on			2
that rarely happens in science , ’ said @entity11			0
' it was one of the best experiences of my career			0
’ in terms of genetic studies , the analysis was straightforward , said @entity11			0
but gathering the data , accomplished in 2009 by @entity24 and co-first author @entity25 , phd , was more difficult			0
much of the @entity2 is undeveloped , without roads , electricity or telephones			0
it 's also one of the most linguistically diverse nations in the world , with dozens of languages spoken			0
‘ they have this very dark skin and bright blond hair			1
it was mind - blowing , ’ said @entity24			2
‘ as a geneticist on the beach watching the kids playing , you count up the frequency of kids with blond hair , and say , ' wow , it 's 5 to 10 percent			1
' around 5 - 10 per cent of the population of the @entity2 have blond hair - but it 's due to an entirely different gene from @entity10 the @entity2 : many assumed the blond hair of @entity35 was the result of gene flow ¿ a trait passed on by @entity10 explorers , traders and others who visited in the preceding centuries @entity24 and @entity25 went village to village explaining what they wanted to do and asking for permission to gather data , @entity24 speaking in @entity2 pidgin , the most widely understood language			1
when the local chief gave the ok , the researchers recruited participants and assessed hair and skin color using a light reflectance meter , took blood pressure readings and measured heights and weights			2
they asked the villagers to spit into small tubes to provide saliva to be used for dna extraction			0
in the span of a month they collected more than 1,000 samples			0
soon after , @entity11 joined the lab and started the analysis , selecting 43 blond - and 42 dark - haired @entity2 from the opposite 10 percent extremes of the hair pigmentation range			1
she used these in a genome - wide association study , a method to reveal differences in the frequency of genetic variants between two groups , that usually requires thousands of samples			2
because the vast majority of human physical characteristics analyzed to date have many genetic and environmental factors , @entity11 expected an inconclusive result that would require much further study			0
instead , she immediately saw a single strong signal on chromosome 9 , which accounted for 50 percent of the variance in the @entity2 ' hair color			0
the team went on to identify the gene responsible , @entity147 , which encodes tyrosinase - related protein 1 , an enzyme previously recognized as influencing pigmentation in mice and humans			2
further research revealed that the particular variant responsible for blond hair in the @entity2 is absent in the genomes of @entity10			1
‘ so the human characteristic of blond hair arose independently in equatorial @entity31			1
that 's quite unexpected and fascinating , ’ @entity11 said .			0

many assumed blonde hair came from @entity10
' @entity164 ' gene actually evolved *separately*
5 - 10 *%* of population have *distinctive* blond gene
islanders *believed* blond hair came from the sun , or a diet rich in fish
