@entity3 authorities are detaining thousands of women illegally and subjecting many to torture because of crimes they allege their husbands committed , a @entity1 report has claimed			1
many women were detained for months or even years without charge while security forces questioned them about their male relatives ' activities rather than crimes in which they themselves were implicated , @entity1 says			2
in custody , women described being kicked , slapped , hung upside - down , beaten on the soles of their feet , given electric shocks , threatened with sexual assault by security forces during interrogation , and even raped in front of their relatives and children			1
' the abuses of women we documented are in many ways at the heart of the current crisis in @entity3 , ' said @entity1 's deputy @entity32 and @entity35 director @entity34 in a statement accompanying the report , titled : ' no one is safe : abuses of @entity41 in @entity3 's @entity42			1
' @entity3 authorities have detained thousands of women without charge and subjected them to torture because of crimes their husbands allegedly committed , the @entity1 claims ( stock image of two @entity3 women in 2003 ) mr @entity49 added : ' these abuses have caused a deep - seated anger and lack of trust between @entity3 's diverse communities and security forces , and all @entity3 are paying the price			1
' a spokesman for @entity3 's @entity58 said the testimonies in the @entity1 report were ' over-exaggerated ' , but acknowledged that ' we have some limited illegal behaviours which were practised by security forces against women prisoners ' , which it said had been identified by the ministry 's own teams			1
these teams had referred their reports to the relevant authorities , ' asking them to bring those who are responsible for mistreating female detainees to justice ' , the spokesman said			0
' @entity3 is still working to put an end to prison abuse and , with more time , understanding of law and patience , such illegal practices will become a history , ' he said			2
the 105 - page report is based on interviews with imprisoned @entity83 and @entity84 women and girls , although @entity83 make up the vast majority of the more than 4,200 women detained in @entity88 and @entity90 facilities , @entity1 said			2
the release of women detainees was a main demand of @entity83 who began demonstrating late in 2012 against the @entity84 - led government , which they accuse of marginalising their community			0
revelations : the alleged abuses were revealed in the @entity1 report entitled ' no one is safe : abuses of women in @entity3 's criminal justice system ' security forces cleared one of two @entity83 protest camps in @entity108 in december 2013			1
in the ensuing backlash , militants seized the city of @entity112 and parts of @entity114			0
since then , more than 1,000 people have been killed across @entity3 , according to @entity116 , and the army is preparing for a possible ground assault to retake @entity112			0
one woman who entered her meeting with @entity1 at a death row facility in @entity122 on crutches said she had been permanently disabled by abuse , displaying injuries consistent with the mistreatment she alleged			0
seven months later , she was executed despite lower court rulings that dismissed charges against her following a medical report that supported her accusations of torture			0
@entity1 described @entity3 's judiciary as weak and plagued by corruption , with convictions frequently based on coerced confessions , and trial proceedings that fall far short of international standards			1
if women are released unharmed , they are frequently stigmatised by their family or community , who perceive them to have been dishonoured , @entity1 said			0
' both men and women suffer from the severe flaws of the criminal justice system			0
but women suffer a double burden due to their second - class status in @entity3 society , ' @entity1 said .			2

alleged abuse is detailed in a new @entity1 report
it claims women are being held for years without charge or being brought before a judge
victims claim they are beaten and threatened with sexual abuse in custody
some have alleged they were raped in front of their relatives and children
spokesman for @entity3 's @entity58 claimed the @entity1 report is ' over-exaggerated ' but acknowledged ' some limited illegal behaviours '
