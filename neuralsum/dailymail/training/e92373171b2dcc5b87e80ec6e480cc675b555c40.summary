a mother has told of how she opened a tin of tomatoes when she was making a family meal and found a maggot floating on top			1
@entity6 , 27 , was preparing to cook a spaghetti bolognese at home after buying the £ 1.50 tin at a @entity11 supermarket			1
but when she went to add the tinned tomatoes , she spotted the larva just before she poured them in			1
she said it was ' absolutely disgusting '			1
mrs @entity6 , from @entity26 near @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ' we were at home and i was opening the tin of tomatoes to make a spaghetti bolognese for my family			1
' usually i would just tip in the contents and not even look but fortunately i did this time - and then i saw something in the tin			2
' i wondered what it was and looked a bit closer and realised what it was			2
' the tomatoes would have been fresh when they went in the can but it made me think the food must be dirty			2
' my eight year old daughter @entity49 was absolutely mortified			2
she was really funny about what she was eating afterwards			0
disgusted : @entity6 with her family ( from left ) @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity49 ' at first i did n't know if i was overreacting or not but everyone i 've spoken to about it has been horrified			1
i 'll be double checking all my tins and cans from now on			0
' now mrs @entity6 , a hairdresser , has been left disappointed by @entity11 's response after she complained about her discovery			1
she called the supermarket chain and took the larva to @entity11 in @entity63 , @entity28 , where she bought the offending tin			1
there , she reluctantly took a £ 1.50 refund from the customer services and was told someone would be in touch			0
she said : ' i was not out to make money from this , but an apology would have been nice			0
i asked if i took the £ 1.50 would it affect anything i could receive as an apology and they said no. ' i was expecting a call but i got a letter in the post on thursday saying ‘ there appeared to be a maggot ' in the can and here is a 10 pounds voucher			2
' there was no customer service or customer care in their response			0
a phone call would have been lovely , just to say sorry			0
' i know you have to apologise to someone properly if you treat them like this			0
it was the sort of letter where all they do is fill in the details that are personal to me			0
' when i told family and friends about it they were disgusted			1
' a spokeswoman for @entity11 said : ' we set ourselves high standards for the quality of the food we sell			1
we have apologised to @entity108 and given her a gesture of goodwill			0
' once we have conducted a full investigation our customer service team will update her with our findings			0

@entity6 , 27 , was preparing a meal for her family at home
but she was left disgusted when she *narrowly* *avoided* adding a maggot
the insect larva was in a tin of tomatoes she was about to add
the *furious* mother , from @entity28 , said it was ' absolutely disgusting '
@entity11 , where she bought the tin , said it was investigating
