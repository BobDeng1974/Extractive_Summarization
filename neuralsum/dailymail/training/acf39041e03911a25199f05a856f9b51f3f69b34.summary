the inter-team rivalry between sir @entity8 and @entity9 and the debate over who will lead @entity12 at this year 's @entity13 has been setting the cycling world alight			1
however , the latest war of words is not being waged by the world class cyclists , but instead , by one of their partners			0
mr @entity8 , who won the @entity21 with @entity9 finishing in second place , has claimed a decision on who will lead this team at this year 's race will not be made until much nearer to the 29 june start date			1
but @entity9 believes he has already been given the nod by the @entity12 principal sir @entity29 to lead the @entity32 team 's challenge as @entity33 focuses on winning the @entity34 , which starts this weekend			1
mr @entity8 suggested during a recent interview @entity12 might run with both of them , hinting a possible co-leadership of the nine - strong @entity13 team			2
but this did not seem to sit well with mr @entity9 ’s fiancee , @entity0 who branded the comments ' blatant lies ' in a tweet , which has since been deleted			1
earlier this week she also told her near - 10,000 @entity1 followers : ‘ @entity9 and @entity46 on the same start line , in the same kit ? mmm ... doubt it			2
‘ to those claiming that this @entity33 / @entity9 thing is some sort of publicity stunt , you are wrong			2
i look forward to @entity12 clearing up this mess , asap			0
’ @entity33 deleted her @entity1 account			2
she had been defending her husband after he swore at paparazzi when he left hospital last november after being hit by a car			0
@entity62 ’s intervention followed a public spat this week between the two riders			0
@entity33 triggered it on monday by saying that he planned to win the @entity34 — his main goal for 2013 — and then , contrary to expectations , to go on to defend his @entity13 title			0
@entity9 responded a few hours later , reiterating his belief that he expected to be team leader as his reward for riding in support of @entity33 during last year ’s @entity13 , in which he finished second			1
in a statement , @entity9 said : ‘ there has been much speculation regarding the leadership for @entity12 at the @entity13 this year			1
i have made it clear that winning the @entity13 would be my main objective for 2013			0
‘ i have been reassured by the management at @entity12 that i have their full backing and at no time has the leadership of the tour been in question			0
’ it echoes a situation last summer when mrs @entity33 and ms @entity0 exchanged thinly veiled jibes online			0
the ' wag war ' echoes that of last summer when @entity33 and ms @entity0 exchanged thinly veiled jibes online former page 3 girl @entity90 , the partner of @entity91 , another of mr @entity93 's teammates weighed in to last year 's row , apparently in support of ms @entity0 it came as mr @entity9 was forced into a support role for his team captain			1
tensions first arose during stage 11 of the race , when mr @entity9 was instructed to hold back so that mr @entity8 could catch up and retain the leader 's yellow jersey			2
ms @entity0 , a sports photographer tweeted : ' team work is also about giving the people around you , that support you , a chance to shine in their own right			0
' mrs @entity33 quickly shot a tweet back in response which praised other members of the @entity114 @entity113 and @entity115 for ' genuine , selfless effort and true professionalism ' - but omitted mr @entity9			0
this tweet led to an immediate response from ms @entity0 who replied : ' do n't think there are many other pro-riders who 's partners know more about cycling than @entity9 's precisely & i know what happened just then			1
' ' if you want loyalty , get a @entity9 dog a quality i value although being taken advantage of by others ! ' @entity90 , the partner of @entity91 , another of mr @entity93 's teammates then weighed in to the row , apparently in support of ms @entity0 .			1

@entity9 's partner @entity0 has taken to @entity1 to join debate
tensions have arisen over who leads @entity12 at this year 's @entity13
