by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 : 19:10 est , 30 november 2013 this is the huge steel arch that will entomb @entity6 's reactor four , and slash the risk of another radioactive disaster			1
the construction , which is one of the biggest engineering projects in history , is being built to seal off nuclear fuel buried inside reactor four which blew up in 1986			2
standing 360 feet tall , and 843 feet wide , the arch will be held together by 680,000 bolts			0
the @entity6 arch is one of the biggest engineering projects in history a workman directs a crane at the @entity6 site people working have an annual allowance of radiation that they are allowed to be exposed to			1
when this allowance runs out they must stop work the huge arch will seal off the reactor at the plant , which blew up in 1986 releasing deadly radiation across @entity32 the arches are being constructed a safe distance away from the reactor site , and will be moved into place when they are completed costing Â£ 1.5billion to build the feat of engineering is a small price to pay to prevent another disaster like the one which blighted generations in the @entity45 region			1
radiation from the blast also spread across the former @entity49 and @entity32 prompting fears at the the time about the safety of nuclear power stations			0
@entity53 , an @entity54 nuclear industry veteran , is overseeing the project			0
workers and experts from 24 countries are working on the prestigious project the reactor at the site was badly damaged in the original explosion and fire , and is too radioactive for the arch to be assembled directly above it workers at the @entity6 site test themselves for radiation an abandoned auditorium at the @entity6 site the 1986 disaster forced people to flee from their homes			1
and 27 years on they have not been able to return a worker gives directions to others working on one half of the giant arch he told the @entity77 : ' nothing like this has ever been attempted before			0
' for anyone in the nuclear business , this is the place you want to be : the biggest , most exciting project in the world right now			0
' specialists from 24 countries are working on the massive project which reached its halfway point in the autumn			0
@entity45 veterans of the disaster are also advising on the works , which should be completed by 2015			2
the arches are being built a few hundred metres away from the actual reactor site workers at the @entity6 chimneys can use up their radiation allowance for the entire year in just a few hours a set of tracks will be built to delicately slide the two halves of the structure into place workers on cherry - pickers asses the huge structure massive job : 680,000 heavy bolts will be screwed in place to hold the structure together one of the huge screws which will hold the two halves of the arch together a worker in a control room at the @entity6 site the reactor at the site was badly damaged in the original explosion and fire , and is too radioactive for the arch to be assembled directly above it			1
so the construction is being put together at a safer distance in two parts , and when both are ready they will slide along tracks to be clamped together in the correct position			0
the project is being paid for by 40 countries , and all staff working at the site have an annual allowance of how much radiation they can be exposed to			2
for some working around the chimney at the site , an entire year 's allowance could be used up in just a few hours			0
when finished the arch will be big enough to house the @entity136 , and wide enough to encase a football pitch			1
workers must wear protective clothing as the site is still highly radioactive the structure looms large over @entity6 , which was abandoned after the 1986 disaster an abandoned block of flats in @entity6 , which is too radioactive for human habitation ghost town : abandoned buildings in @entity6 set an eerie scene a sign warns travellers about the dangerous radiation in @entity6 a worker at the @entity6 nuclear power plant takes a reading of radioactivity inside the ' tomb ' encasing the ruined unit 4 reactor which exploded and caught fire causing a nuclear meltdown on april 26 1986			1

structure set to be completed by 2015 and will protect against another radiation leak
workers at the site have an annual radiation allowance and must stop if they exceed it
the huge arch could encase the @entity136 and fit a football pitch inside
it is being built a few hundred metres from reactor , and will be *wheeled* into place when completed
