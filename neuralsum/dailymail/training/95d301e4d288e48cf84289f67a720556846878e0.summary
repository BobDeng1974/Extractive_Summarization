@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has warned @entity2 needs new energy infrastructure as the country 's spare generation had fallen to five per cent @entity2 could be at risk of blackouts by next winter , the boss of one of the @entity9 energy companies has warned , as old power plants are closed and have not yet been replaced			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity0 said @entity2 needs new energy infrastructure as the country 's amount of spare generation at peak times had fallen from 15 per cent to five per cent this year			1
mr @entity0 said the shortfall raised concerns over the possibility of blackouts as soon as next year			1
mr @entity0 told the @entity25 's @entity24 programme investors needed clarity over energy policy to be provided by the government , in order for new plants to be built			1
he said : ' the amount of spare generation at the peak has gone down from about 15 per cent to this winter when we 'll be about five per cent			1
next winter will be even smaller			2
' so will we get through this winter ? yes			0
will we get through next winter ? i do n't know			0
' the warning came as the chief corporate officer of @entity37 today warned the government 's carbon tax , which charges companies for burning fossil fuels , could make the country ' even more vulnerable to the threat of blackouts '			1
writing in @entity46 , @entity45 said the green levy will force coal - fired plants to close too quickly			0
in october the @entity49 warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years as @entity2 's reserves of electricity had halved in 12 months			1
the report said @entity2 would have ‘ margins ’ of only 5 per cent , the lowest since 2007 , as it headed into the freezing months			1
in october the @entity49 warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years as @entity2 's reserves of electricity had halved in 12 months the margin is the difference between the peak demand and the available supply from the @entity2 ’s power stations and import pipelines			1
if it gets too low , @entity49 can issue warnings to generators to begin producing more electricity to prevent a shortfall developing			0
but if these warnings do not work and the margin between supply and demand reaches zero , then parts of the country could experience blackouts			0
@entity49 director @entity76 however insisted the lights would not go out			0
he said : ‘ while there have been power station closures since last winter , the information suggests that the market can meet demand in cold weather			0
but as the system operator , we ’re never complacent			0
’ the number of coal - based power plants operating in the @entity2 has fallen because of @entity89 legislation which has caused older , polluting , fossil fuel plants to be turned off			1
one fifth of the @entity2 ’s coal capacity has been closed down in the last year because of the @entity89 ’s emissions rules			2
the number of coal - based power plants operating in the @entity2 has fallen because of @entity89 legislation which has caused older , polluting , fossil fuel plants to be turned off a prolonged cold snap , such as the one seen earlier this year , could drain the @entity2 ’s gas reserves as millions of families keep the heating on to ward off the chill			1
the amount left in @entity100 , the @entity2 ’s largest store , hit a record low earlier in the year after freezing temperatures lasted longer than expected			2
last march @entity2 came within hours of running out of gas after one of the under - sea pipes that imports gas from the @entity108 broke down			2
critics said it showed that the country needed to build more gas storage facilities			0
currently the @entity2 has enough gas storage for only 21 days , while @entity114 neighbours can hold enough gas for 100 days			2
all of the @entity9 energy companies have announced price rises this year , with @entity118 the last to do so on friday when it unveiled a 3.7 per cent increase			2
demonstrators hold placards as they march to the @entity1 headquarters , in @entity123 during a protest against energy prices last month the size of that increase took into account the government 's roll - back of green levies , which is expected to knock £ 50 off the average family 's fuel bill			1
in last week 's @entity133 confirmed a plan announced earlier in the week by the @entity135 to make changes to green levies			0
in total , the government claims green taxes add £ 112 to the average bill			0
the changes announced yesterday will reduce household 's bills by £ 50 and bring the average bill rise down from £ 120 to £ 70 a year			0
the chancellor announced that the @entity146 , an insulation scheme delivered by energy providers , will be extended for two years until march 2017 , shaving £ 30 - £ 35 off the average bill next year			0
a further £ 12 rebate on electricity bills will also be added and families will also benefit from a reduction in energy network costs , saving them £ 5 .			2
