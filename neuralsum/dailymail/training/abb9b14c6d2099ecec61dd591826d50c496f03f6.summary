by @entity0 published : 13:32 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 17:56 est , 3 april 2012 primary school teacher @entity1 who was off sick from 2004 on full pay after a catalogue of dubious medical conditions were claimed a teacher who lied about an accident at work and took six years off sick on full pay has been lambasted by an employment judge			1
@entity1 , who had brought an unfair dismissal claim in 2010 , yesterday won the case on a technicality – but was told she would receive no compensation because of her lies			1
however , the case has cost taxpayers around £ 300,000			2
mrs @entity1 , a widow and mother of two , went off sick after her alleged accident in november 2003			1
the 58 - year - old primary school teacher claimed a teaching assistant had an epileptic fit in the classroom and fell on her , trapping her on the floor and leaving her with chest , neck and spinal injuries			1
an investigation by @entity27 in @entity28 - on - @entity29 , @entity30 , concluded the accident never happened			2
she briefly returned to work there , only to be struck by a bus in june 2004 , and has never worked since			0
she was on full pay of about £ 30,000 a year until she was suspended in 2009 – and was finally sacked the following january for gross misconduct			0
her pay while off sick has been estimated at around £ 180,000 and the council ’s legal bill is believed to exceed £ 120,000			0
@entity27 in @entity28 - on - @entity29 , @entity30 , found mrs @entity1 's claim was made up however , the tribunal yesterday found the school governors and her employer , @entity43 , were responsible for an act of victimisation on grounds of disability and unfairly dismissed her as she was not allowed to return to work and deal with grievances according to the rules			1
if proper procedures had been followed she would ‘ inevitably ’ have been sacked fairly , the panel said			0
employment judge @entity52 said her compensation for unfair dismissal was being reduced by 100 per cent because she ‘ told a series of lies ’ and added the credibility of her testimony was ‘ in tatters ’			1
the @entity61 tribunal heard mrs @entity1 had been claiming disability living allowance and industrial injury benefit in 2006 and 2007 yet at the same time told her employers that she was fit to return to work			1
her astonishing list of 26 symptoms in her benefits claim forms included finding it difficult to peel vegetables , open the curtains and turn on the taps			2
in a reserved judgment mr @entity52 said she was ‘ grossly exaggerating ’ her symptoms			0
he said she was a ‘ thoroughly unreliable witness ’ and the account of her accident at work ‘ wholly inconsistent ’			0
her ‘ lies and dissimilitudes ’ included forgetting she owned a second home in @entity82			2
her former headteacher @entity85 told the hearing mrs @entity1 was sacked after lying to her employers about her health			2
he said : ‘ her claims caused			0
an irreparable breakdown of confidence			0
i could not trust this teacher with children			0
’ mrs @entity1 , who moved to the @entity93 from @entity94 in 1981 and lives in @entity61 , also won a claim for breach of contract and unlawful deduction of three weeks ’ wages and is likely to receive modest compensation at a future date .			1

@entity103 said @entity1 told a ' series of lies ' that left her credibility in tatters
@entity109 found her injury claim about being pinned down in the classroom was made up
the widow , 58 , then won her unfair dismissal and victimisation claim - but denied compensation
