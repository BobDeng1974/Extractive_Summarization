by @entity1 reporter published : 19:21 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 14:13 est , 22 august 2013 a retired @entity3 forensic artist has claimed that a long - time suspect in the murder of @entity6 carried around a picture of the missing child as a teenager			1
@entity10 disappeared as he walked to a bus stop in @entity12 when he was six years old			1
authorities believe he was abducted off the street in @entity15 in 1979 and later murdered			0
@entity16 , who worked for the @entity3 for 32 years , believes that @entity17 , a child - molesting drifter who has long been suspected of killing @entity18 , had a picture of @entity10 when he was a teenager			2
the artist is basing his claim on an age - progression sketch he did of @entity18 as a teenager which is eerily close to another picture of a teenage boy , seen wearing a t - shirt and jeans on a bus			1
resemblance : a photo of a teenaged boy looks very similar to an age - progression sketch of @entity6 , who disappeared when he was just 6 ' in 1990 , i believed @entity6 was the young man in the photograph on the bus			1
i have not changed my mind , ' mr @entity16 told the @entity40			0
' the fact that @entity17 had the photograph in his pocket is the thing that kind of threw me over the edge			0
' however , police sources told the @entity40 that they are certain the young man in the photograph is not @entity6 after they tracked him down , held interviews and even completed a dna test			1
the case gets even more complicated after another man , @entity52 , confessed last year to strangling @entity18 in the basement of a @entity15 bodega in 1979			1
a photograph of @entity18 as a teenager would reveal his confessions to be false			0
in 1990 , mr @entity16 was asked by the @entity58 to create a picture of @entity6 showing the missing boy as a teenager			1
the forensic artist worked painstakingly to recreate an image from family photos			0
later he was shown a @entity65 that had been taken by police from @entity17 ' pocket			0
he told @entity68 he is extremely interested to see any photographs taken of the teenager found by police , while they were holding interviews and tests			0
' all i ever wanted to see was a photograph			0
if they got the right guy , he should match that boy on the bus , ' mr @entity16 said			0
' but i 've never seen it			0
' monster : convicted child molester @entity17 was long - considered the prime suspect in @entity18 's disappearance @entity85 leads : @entity3 agents tear up the floor of a @entity15 basement after the @entity18 case was reopened it 's not clear whether any pictures of the teenager detectives tracked down were ever released to the public			1
mr @entity16 , who is writing a book about his part in the @entity18 case , said he was never contacted again regarding the missing boy after he submitted his age progression drawing			1
@entity99 ' connection to @entity18 is through one of the boy 's babysitters , who was friends with @entity17			1
shortly after @entity18 's disappearance , @entity17 was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation and served a 27 - year prison sentence in @entity106			1
at the time of his arrest , authorities found dozens of photos in the drainpipe where @entity17 had been living of young boys who all had a strong resemblance to @entity18			2
while incarcerated , a jailhouse snitch told authorities that @entity17 had confessed to him that he knew what happened to @entity18			2
however , it was n't enough evidence for prosecutors to pursue charges			0
despite no criminal charges , the @entity18 family sued @entity17 in civil court , where he was found to have been responsible for the boy 's death			1
the @entity18 family was awarded a ceremonial $ 2million , which they never attempted to collect			0
confusion : @entity52 claims he killed @entity18 , but there is no evidence linking him to the crime @entity17 , 70 , is currently in a @entity106 prison for failing to register as a sex offender after serving a 27 - year prison sentence			2
the child molester has repeatedly denied involvement in @entity18 's disappearance			2
@entity18 's father @entity139 told the @entity40 that he was shown the photo but does n't believe it is his son			2
@entity52 , who was arrested in may , 2012 - after manhattan district attorney @entity143 re-opened the @entity18 case - when family members told authorities that he admitted to killing @entity18			0
at the time of @entity18 's disappearance , @entity52 worked in a bodega just blocks from the boy 's home			1
prosecutors may be forced to throw out the case against @entity52 - who is both schizophrenic and suffering from bipolar disorder - due to a lack of evidence .			0

@entity6 was last seen in 1979 when he walked alone to the bus stop in @entity160 for the first time
a man confessed last year to kidnapping @entity18 and murdering him in the basement of a bodega just blocks from the boy 's house
many suspect the man 's confession is bogus and is just the *product* of his mental illness
