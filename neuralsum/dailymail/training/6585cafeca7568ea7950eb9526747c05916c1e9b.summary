a greedy toad found deep in the @entity7 rainforest tried to swallow a hapless bat whole but only succeeded in making itself look like a bizarre mutant animal as it failed to eat its super-sized meal			1
a quick - witted ranger captured the macabre but comic scene , which saw both animals suffer some discomfort but survive			1

a quick - witted ranger captured the comic scene , which saw both animals suffer some discomfort but survive the cane toad is a large , terrestrial amphibian that is native to @entity26 and @entity27 , but has been introduced to various islands throughout @entity29 and the @entity30			1
the cane toad is a prolific breeder - females lay single - clump spawns with thousands of eggs			2
its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding as the toad has a diet of both dead and living matter			1
adults average 10 to 15 cm in length but the largest recorded specimen weighed 2.65 kg and measured 38 cm long			0
the cane toad is an old species and a fossil toad dating from the @entity46 of @entity47 is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from northern @entity27			2
the species has poison glands and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested			0
the cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in some of the regions it was introduced into as a method of pest control			2
park ranger @entity61 spotted the strange behaviour in the @entity64 national park , the @entity60 blog reported			0
he said the cane toad was sitting on the ground with its mouth open as it optimistically waited for its lunch to appear and seemed to get lucky as a low - flying bat entered its area			1
experts believe bats fly close to the ground despite the rick of predators to pick up insects and mr @entity61 said the bat passed incredibly close to the toad , almost flying into its mouth			2
the toad reportedly snatched at the bat , but it is not clear whether this was a refex action or a deliberate move to snare a large dinner			0
whatever the case , the creature clamped its powerful jaws around the furry critter , cramming it into its mouth			0
the photograph captures the toad 's discomfort as it battles to swallow the mammal whole , despite the bat 's wings and tail sticking out of its mouth			1
it is not clear if the cane toad ( like the one pictured ) deliberately lunged at the bat or expected its meal to be slightly smaller , but the creature reportedly clamped its powerful jaws around the furry critter , cramming it into its mouth @entity99 , assistant professor of herpetology at the @entity101 , told @entity102 : ' toads are voracious and will eat pretty much anything that moves and can fit in their mouth			1
' however , he said he had not seen another toad attempt the same move before			0
while the creatures can swallow large beetles and centipedes with ease , the bat was either too large or too furry for the hungry amphibian as it spat out its dinner			2
@entity118 , a postdoctoral fellow at the @entity101 , explained that as cane toads do not have teeth , the animal tried to crush and swallow the bat			0
a happy ending : despite almost becoming dinner , the bat escaped unscathed and flew away quickly after its incarceration in the toad 's mouth			1
a short - tailed fruit bat that lives in the @entity7 rainforest is pictured he told @entity102 : ' the bat was a little big for that			1
the toad may have tried to reposition its mouth to swallow and that was when the bat was able to escape			2
' amazingly , despite the ordeal the bat escaped unscathed and flew away quickly after its incarceration			0
the amphibians are known to eat almost anything , which perhaps accounts why they have invaded so many habitats			0
dr @entity118 said : ' it could be this population of toads have developed a strategy for feeding on low flying bats and that this is more common , but never observed before now			0

a ranger captured the moment a cane toad attacked an *airborne* bat in the @entity7 rainforest
the photograph shows the toad 's discomfort as it battles to swallow the mammal despite the bat 's wings and tail sticking out of its mouth
while *scientists* have not seen the toad behave in this way before , the amphibian is not a picky eater and has a diet of both dead and living matter
