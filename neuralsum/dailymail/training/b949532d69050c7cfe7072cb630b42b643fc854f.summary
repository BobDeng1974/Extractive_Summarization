by @entity0 published : 19:33 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 19:33 est , 19 november 2012 the number of women dying from ovarian cancer has fallen by a quarter in 20 years thanks to earlier diagnosis and better treatment , say researchers			1
and the length of time the women survived for also increased , especially amongst women aged between 40 and 60			1
ovarian cancer is known as the ‘ silent killer ’ because it is notoriously difficult to diagnose and is often detected only once it has spread to other organs			1
it remains the fifth most common form of cancer amongst women , with 6,500 cases diagnosed in @entity19 a year			1
the number of women dying from ovarian cancer has fallen by a quarter in 20 years scientists from the @entity21 compared data on mortality and survival from 1989 with the latest figures from 2009			1
they found that mortality rates had fallen from 11.9 per cent per 100,000 women in 1989 to 8.8 per cent in 2009 – a drop of 26 per cent			0
and almost three quarters of sufferers survived for at least a year , with 44 per cent still alive five years later			2
in 1989 , a little over half of patients lived beyond a year and only a third survived for five years			2
the biggest improvements in survival rates occurred amongst 40 to 60 - year - olds			2
rates for those aged 45 to 49 rose almost 50 per cent in ten years , with 61 per cent living for at least a year			0
experts believe these women have responded particularly well to national awareness campaigns alerting them to the early warning signs of the disease			0
silent killer : ovarian cancer is difficult to diagnose and is often detected only once it has spread to other organs this has coincided with improvements in care , with patients usually referred to specialised gynaecology centres run by highly experienced surgeons and consultants			1
but the @entity21 – which is funded by the government and cancer charities to carry out research – found that survival rates have barely improved amongst the elderly			0
only 24 per cent of over- 85s lived for at least a year , compared with 23 per cent living this long in 1989			0
elderly women may also be less aware of the symptoms and unwilling to trouble their gp , even if they suspect something is wrong			0
lead author @entity65 , a consultant gynaecologist at @entity66 , said : ‘ this drop in deaths may reflect improvements in detecting and treating the disease , such as improvements in scanning , surgery and chemotherapy treatments			0
‘ additionally , over the past decade , ovarian cancer patients throughout the @entity19 have experienced better management due to organisation of ovarian cancer care in specialist gynaecological cancer centres , planning of care by teams of cancer experts and specialist surgery by specially trained and accredited gynaecological oncologists			1
’ a number of charities have run awareness campaigns over the past decade alerting women to the warning signs of the disease , which include bloating , loss of appetite and severe pain			0
patients and @entity97 can often confuse these symptoms with irritable bowel syndrome or period pains			0
the @entity101 is hoping to improve diagnosis rates and last year a £ 20 blood test capable of detecting the illness was made available to gps for the first time			2
@entity112 , head of the @entity21 , said : ‘ as ovarian cancer can be very hard to diagnose and treat , this report was important to help us learn as much as we can about the numbers of women who develop the disease , how many survive and how many die			1

length of time woman survived also increased , especially among 40 - 60s
ovarian cancer hard to diagnose and often detected after it has spread
it is the 5th most common form of cancer amongst women with 6,500 cases diagnosed in @entity19 a year
