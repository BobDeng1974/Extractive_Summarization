skipper @entity0 has challenged @entity1 to keep their fate in their own hands by securing a fifth successive derby victory over @entity5			1
the @entity7 rivals meet at the @entity8 on sunday with @entity1 having won the last four meetings , but in grave need of three points to ease themselves away from the developing battle for @entity15 survival			1
@entity0 and his team - mates could find themselves inside the relegation zone by the time they run out if @entity20 get the better of @entity21 in the day 's earlier kick - off , and that would make three points a necessity			1
@entity0 , pictured playing for @entity26 at the weekend , wants a fifth straight derby win against @entity5 the @entity1 captain celebrates scoring against @entity5 in the @entity27 of 2012 the @entity29 international told @entity31 : ' that 's the big issue : whoever we were facing this weekend , be in @entity5 , be it @entity36 , be it @entity38 , whoever the case may be , it 's a case of getting the three points as soon as we can and getting everyone energised again and looking forward to the remaining games			1
' look , we know we 're not in the position that we 'd like to be in , but we know we can get out of it			0
it 's in our hands			0
' after a dreadful run of results against their arch - rivals , the @entity1 have fared rather well in recent times , winning the last three at @entity52 and the most recent game on @entity54			2
asked what lay behind that run of results , @entity0 said : ' staying together as a unit , keeping the team spirit strong , working as a unit all over the pitch and taking chances			2
' making sure we got clean sheets and also whether it was early or late in the game , making sure we took chances - they were the keys , and obviously having a strong squad as well because there were a couple of times where there were changes in the line - up before games			0
@entity75 rues a missed opportunity during defeat to @entity78 in @entity1 's previous game ' everyone has got to be mentally prepared to start the game , and obviously anything can happen then in the 90 minutes			2
' look , it 's one of those things , we have a chance of creating a fantastic record against a big rival , the main rival for us , so it 's a fantastic opportunity			0
' but ultimately , it comes down to wanting it more on the day and hopefully , that will be the case			0
