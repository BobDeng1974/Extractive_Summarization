the biggest impression @entity1 had made on world cricket came when he was barged by @entity3 during a one - day international at the @entity4 seven years ago and was unwittingly caught in the middle of a major row between @entity7 and @entity8			1
now he will be remembered for all the right reasons			0
@entity1 , a little known all - rounder born in @entity10 but a naturalised @entity11 , played one of the great one - day innings on tuesday for his adopted country against the nation of his birth to take @entity8 to their first @entity18 final			1
it led to jubilant scenes at @entity22 ’s @entity21 , a venue more readily associated with @entity8 ’s rugby triumphs than cricketing ones , and breathed life into a tournament in which exciting finishes have been all too rare			0
@entity1 celebrates hitting a six against @entity10 to put @entity8 through to the @entity18 final @entity30 embraces @entity1 while bowler @entity31 lays on the ground after the crucial blow @entity1 , 36 , powered his way to what would be a match - winning unbeaten 84 in the @entity8 chase what a day for @entity8 and what a day for 36 - year - old @entity1 , who had not played international cricket for 14 months when he became one of coach @entity41 ’s inspired choices for this @entity18			1
@entity1 beams as he meets the press after the match @entity1 will surely never play another innings like his unbeaten 84 which earned @entity8 the most nerve - racking of victories with just a ball to spare against a @entity50 team who fell short when it most mattered yet again			1
and @entity1 will surely never play another shot like the six that soared over the short long - on boundary with five needed off two balls from the world ’s greatest fast bowler in @entity31			2
a man who has had a largely anonymous career that has taken in @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 was humble enough to console the stricken @entity31 in scenes reminiscent of @entity66 ’s ashes embrace of @entity67 in 2005			0
then @entity1 talked of how much this means for a country who will now take on either @entity71 or @entity72 in the final on sunday after falling short in no fewer than six previous @entity18 semi-finals			1
‘ i was looking to hit that ball for six or four , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ i was just going to line it up and it was going over the boundary			0
it means a lot to the players but you only had to look to the stands to see how much it meant to a lot of people			0
’ this was glorious vindication for the attacking , modern brand of one - day cricket that @entity8 have been producing under their impressive captain @entity92 with players who have not always been regarded as dynamic			1
@entity1 goes for broke on the penultimate ball of the match and his sweet strike soars into the stands @entity31 , for many the world 's best fast bowler , stands with his hands on his knees as @entity1 celebrates @entity1 shakes hands and consoles @entity31 as the conclusion of the match at @entity22 's @entity21 the batsman sparked memories of @entity66 's sportsmanship with @entity67 in the 2007 ashes @entity1 has never been seen as the epitome of modern 50 - over power and nor has @entity113 , who came of age as a limited - overs batsman with his double century in the quarter - final against @entity117			1
if they can do it , then why not @entity7 , if they throw off the shackles and start again in one - day cricket after their embarrassing exit in the group stages ? @entity8 were in all sorts of turmoil two years ago when they messily sacked @entity128 as captain but what has happened since has been little short of phenomenal , and they will provide the stiffest of opposition to @entity7 in both @entity134 and one - day cricket in may and june			2
before his semi-final heroics , @entity1 was best known for his collision with @entity3 in 2008 then captain @entity138 apologised for upholding the appeal that saw @entity1 run out after the clash this was heartbreaking for @entity10 , who did little to shake off their reputation as perennial chokers on the big occasion			1
yet to use the ‘ c - word ’ they hate so much would be harsh on @entity10			0
they fumbled two crucial run - out chances and then saw @entity150 and @entity151 collide in the deep ( above ) when @entity152 offered a skyer with 14 needed for victory , but were simply beaten by the better team			0
‘ i really did feel the pressure , it was stressful towards the end , ’ said @entity1 , who saw @entity8 home in company with the veteran @entity158			2
that was of little consolation to @entity10 captain @entity164 , who struggled to contain his emotions after coming off second best in one of the great @entity18 games			2
‘ we wanted to take the trophy home and lift our nation ’s hearts but we were n’t able to do that , ’ said @entity168			0
‘ but life moves on and the sun will come up tomorrow			0

@entity10 - born @entity1 hit match - winning 84 not out in semi-final
@entity8 reached first @entity18 final with @entity1 's penultimate ball six
@entity1 , 36 , had not played international cricket for 14 months when *picked*
win is vindication for the attacking brand played under @entity92
@entity8 play the winner of the semi-final between @entity71 or @entity72
