by @entity0 friday the 13th is a date that elicits superstitions in many people , while a full moon has often mistakenly been said to cause insanity			1
so on the rare occasion these two events combine , are we set to be in store for a mythical phenomenon , or will it be a day like any other ? we ’ll find out today , as a full moon coincides with the date in the @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 for the last time until 2049			1
today marks the last time a full moon ( pictured ) will fall on a friday the 13th date for 35 years until 13 august 2049			1
the event is extremely rare , occurring only once every 20 years on average			1
the full moon is visible across most of the world including the @entity25 and @entity14 on the 13th if you ’ve ever spotted the moon near the horizon , it may have appeared much larger - a phenomenon called the moon illusion			1
a moon near the horizon , particularly a full moon , can appear bigger			1
this often leads people to incorrectly claim the moon is closer , or is a ‘ supermoon ’			0
in reality , the effect is an optical illusion , although scientists are n't sure why it occurs			0
it ’s most likely due to the @entity46 illusion , below			0
the two yellow lines are the same length , although they do n’t seem so at first glance			0
the same is true with the moon illusion ; at the horizon , our brain thinks it is closer than when it is up above us			0
the moon actually reached its ‘ fullest ’ point at 6:11am bst time this morning , although it will still be visible tonight			2
the last time friday the 13th occurred at the same time as a full moon was back on 13 october 2000			1
and the event wo n’t occur again until 13 august 2049			2
the reason the event is so rare is because there chances of three different scenarios occurring at the same time is very slim , reports @entity63			0
to calculate the chances of the event occurring , the probabilities of those events need to be calculated			0
first , for friday the 13th and a full moon to coincide , the moon must be in its fullest phase			1
there are on average about 12 full moons a year , making the odds of one day being a full moon about 3.39 per cent			1
the odds of any day being a friday , meanwhile , are one in seven - and the chances that a particular day is the 13th is 3.29 per cent			0
multiplying these together , and by the number of days in the year , shows that this rare event occurs on average about once every 20 years , although , of course , this varies somewhat			1
for example , while we have to wait 35 years for this event to happen again , our descendents in 2049 will have to wait just 14 years for the next one on 13 april 2063			2
it takes the moon about 28 days to orbit @entity89 , during which time it goes through several phases as the sun lights up different parts of its surface			2
when the face we can see is n't lit , it is known as a new moon , followed by ( clockwise from bottom left ) a waxing crescent , waxing gibbous and full moon ( 100 per cent lit ) in other moon news , scientists recently discovered why the face of the lunar surface we can see has a ' @entity105 ' , but the far side of the moon does not			2
scientists at @entity109 revealed how the near side 's proximity to the scorching young earth weakened it , and made it more susceptible to asteroid impacts that caused features like this to form			0
the general consensus on the moon 's origin is that it probably formed shortly after @entity89 and was the result of a @entity121 - sized object hitting @entity89 with a glancing but devastating impact .			0

today marks the last time a full moon falls on friday the 13th until 2049
the event is visible across large parts of the world including @entity14 and @entity25
the two events combine on average about once every 20 years
and the last time this happened was back on 13 october 2000
