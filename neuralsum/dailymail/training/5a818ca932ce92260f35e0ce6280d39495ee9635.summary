by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 18 september 2012 convicted : @entity1 , who aborted her own baby within a week of his due date , was sentenced to eight years in prison by a judge at @entity7 a married woman who aborted her baby in the final week of pregnancy following an affair with a work colleague was jailed for eight years yesterday			1
@entity1 , 35 , successfully concealed the pregnancy from her husband and took drugs she had bought on the internet to end her pregnancy			1
she claimed the boy was stillborn and she buried him and cleaned up the bathroom at home without her husband finding out			2
however , police inquiries later revealed the baby was aborted just two days before her due date – and the following day she went on a family holiday to @entity25 as if nothing had happened			1
the alarm was raised because there was a record of @entity1 ’s pregnancy from an abortion clinic ’s scan she had after passing the 24 - week legal limit for terminations			1
she lied to detectives about having a legal abortion at a clinic , but officers have never found the baby ’s remains or evidence to show he was n’t born alive			1
@entity1 has refused to say where her son ’s remains could be found			1
she pleaded guilty earlier this year to administering a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage			1
passing sentence , mr @entity58 said : ‘ the child in the womb here was so near to birth that in my judgement all right - thinking people would consider this offence more serious than manslaughter , or any offence on the calendar other than murder			2
’ he told @entity1 she had robbed an apparently healthy child , ‘ vulnerable and defenceless , of the life which he was about to commence ’			1
he added : ‘ this was a cold , calculated decision that you took for your self - interest alone			2
’ @entity7 heard @entity1 had an extraordinary history of secret pregnancies and deception			1
in 1999 , when she was a second year university student , she hid her first pregnancy from her parents			2
she quit her maths course , gave birth to a daughter in hospital and gave her up for adoption immediately			2
she then began the relationship with @entity77 , who she would marry in 2009 after having two children			0
but in 2000 , during the early stages of their relationship , @entity1 had an abortion with his agreement at ‘ around the legal limit ’ of 24 weeks			1
she did later give birth to a girl , but only after seeking to have a termination when she was ‘ too far advanced ’			0
astonishingly , she also kept a further pregnancy a secret from mr @entity77 until the birth			2
despite marrying mr @entity77 , a 41 - year - old electrical engineer , she was conducting a long - term affair with a married colleague at the law firm in @entity94 where she worked as an office manager			0
the on - off affair had gone on for seven years without mr @entity77 finding out , the court heard			2
in october 2009 @entity1 told her lover she was pregnant			1
he offered to leave his wife to start a family with her but she ended the relationship and in january told him there was no child and it was none of his business			0
the couple resumed their ‘ occasional sexual relationship ’ in june 2010 – soon after she had the home abortion at almost full term			0
during more than nine hours of interviews with police @entity1 insisted she paid £ 1,700 cash for an abortion at the @entity128 clinic in @entity129 three days before the legal cut - off date			1
detectives , however , discovered a trail of evidence to show she was concealing a crime			0
it began in march 2010 when she went to the @entity7 branch of the @entity136 with the intention of having an abortion			1
sentencing : @entity1 was jailed for eight years by a judge sitting at @entity7 however , it was n’t carried out because an ultrasound scan indicated she was 26 weeks pregnant			1
@entity1 had a second scan at @entity143 ’ hospital in @entity7 where superior equipment estimated she was 29 weeks pregnant			1
immediately after the scan she did an internet search , asking : ‘ where can i get an illegal abortion ? ’ in april @entity1 ordered an abortion drug over the internet from a company in @entity153 , @entity154			1
the package was delivered on may 10 and she carried out further searches about the drug			0
she took an afternoon off work on may 25 and is likely to have taken the abortion drug then			0
she is believed to have given birth while her husband was out the next day			0
@entity1 told a psychiatrist she ‘ acted alone ’ at her home in @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity166			1
she claimed ‘ the child was a boy , was not breathing on birth and did not move ’			0
the judge told @entity1 she had shown no ‘ remorse ’ , commenting that , had she not taken the drug , ‘ there is no reason to believe that you would not have been delivered of a healthy boy ’			1
mr @entity77 did not attend court			0
he is said to be standing by his wife			0
the dangers of online abortion pills were highlighted by the @entity180 last year when it was discovered that @entity182 firms were selling the drugs for as little as £ 15			0
a mail investigation found that @entity185 could have the tablets delivered in less than a week , enabling them to terminate their pregnancies illegally and in secret			0
it is against the law for the pills to be administered without the supervision of a doctor or specially - trained nurse			0
the investigation found that pills available online were far cheaper than having the treatment privately , which can cost up to £ 500			0
buyers had only to fill in a quick online form giving their date of birth , address , and details of any allergies or medication they were taking			0
it is legal to have an abortion in the @entity182 during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy , but the abortion must be performed in a hospital or specialised licensed clinic			2
two doctors must also agree that it would cause less damage to the woman 's physical or mental health than continuing with the pregnancy			2
it can only be performed after 24 weeks if the woman 's life is at risk , or there is a substantial risk the child would suffer serious physical or mental handicap .			0
