by @entity0 @entity1 declared himself happy with his preparations for this week ’s @entity3 at @entity4 after bouncing back from a familiar friday failure in the @entity6			1
@entity1 continued a trend of following a superb opening round with a terrible second one , shooting a seven - over - par 78 at @entity10 just a day after setting a course record of 64			1
the 25 - year - old responded with a solid 68 on saturday — with four birdies after dropping a shot at the first — to finish three under par , seven adrift of leaders @entity18 and @entity19			1
despondent : @entity1 followed a course record 64 on day one with six bogeys and a double a day later turning it round : despite his horror day two , @entity1 was upbeat during his third round in @entity10 good response : @entity1 hit a third - round 68 at the @entity6 to cheer his morale ahead of @entity3 upturn in form : @entity1 plays his second shot on the first hole during his third round at @entity10 ‘ i ’ve shot 64 and 68 on this course , which are two really good scores , ’ said the former world no 1			1
‘ friday was just one of those days when nothing went right			2
i could n’t get any momentum			2
‘ it would be nice to shoot another good one tomorrow , but i feel good with my game and i saw enough positives in there to give me confidence going into @entity3			1
i played solid golf and did n’t put myself in much trouble			2
i feel much more prepared going into next week			2
‘ coming in here i was hitting shots into the wind on the range perfectly , but today i hit a couple that were n’t so good			0
‘ hitting them in practice and hitting them under the gun are two completely different things and being able to do that over the past three days and tomorrow as well can only help going into next week			0
‘ it ’s just about getting rid of these bad stretches of holes or these bad second rounds or whatever it is			0
if i can get rid of that , then there ’s no reason why i ca n’t go there next week and really contend			0
’ scotsman @entity19 will carry home hopes into the final day as the 33 - year - old goes in search of his first tour win for seven years			1
but he will have to erase memories of a horror show at this event two years ago when he was leading with four holes to go but blew it			1
@entity19 said : ‘ i ’m in a great position , a very exciting position			0
for us @entity76 guys it does n’t get much better than this			0
it ’s our fifth major			0
‘ winning ’s never easy but i ’ve been in this situation before , so once the gun goes i ’ll be ready to do my job			0
’ tied at the top : @entity19 leads the @entity6 with @entity18 going into the final round warm - up : rose in action during his second round at the @entity6 in @entity10			1

the 25 - year - old bounced back from a horror second round at @entity6
after firing a course - record 64 on *thursday* he carded 78 a day later
but on saturday he *picked* himself up by firing a four - under par 68
@entity1 is *considered* one of the *favourites* for @entity3 at @entity4
