@entity11 , the police chief of the @entity13 capital of @entity14 placed his hand on @entity4 's shoulder and smiled for the camera , and then appeared in a second photograph with his hand on the shoulder of @entity5 who was captured gazing up at the officer			2
the @entity24 duo were then taken on a two hour flight to the port town of @entity27 and transferred to nusakambangan island where they are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as ' @entity32 ' , a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms			1
the spot is called @entity37 , and it 's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of nusakambangan , which is also known as ' @entity42 ' , and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the @entity10 government executed five drug smugglers			1
situated quite high up amid hills in the island 's centre , @entity37 was also the place where the @entity13 bombers , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 were executed in 2008 , six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people , including 88 @entity3 , 38 @entity10 and 27 @entity136			1
at the top of the hills surrounding @entity37 , it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the @entity140 to the south			2
at around 12.40am on january 18 this year , five drug traffickers were reportedly shot by firing squads in or around this place			0
shackled and handcuffed , @entity4 cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless @entity10 police officers across the tarmac after being taken from @entity149 prison in @entity13 to their final destination , @entity42 @entity152 despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner , @entity5 , as he arrived at @entity155 in @entity67 , @entity10 , only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside @entity148 on the island of @entity13 this is the exterior of @entity77 prison on @entity113 island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold @entity3 @entity4 and @entity5 ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad @entity10 executed a total of six drug traffickers on january 18 , but @entity172 woman @entity170 met her fate on the mainland of central java at a place called @entity177			1
the five executed at @entity97 on @entity179 were @entity181 @entity180 , 53 , who smuggled 13kg of coaine in hangliding equipment to @entity13 in 2004 , @entity184 national @entity186 , who ran an @entity189 factory , @entity190 , 48 , @entity10 woman , @entity191 , 38 , and @entity193 @entity192 , 38 , a @entity194 who elected to be buried on the island			2
the lead up to execution in ' @entity32 ' has been well documented			2
under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in @entity10 's criminal act of 1964 , the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out			0
they are reportedly allowed three ' last requests ' but these may only be in the form of final statements , such as that from ms @entity191 who wrote , ' submission does not mean give up			0
do the best , @entity212 will finish the rest '			0
@entity214 @entity10 took a camera to @entity97 ( above ) on nusakambangan pirson island prior to the first round of executions which took place in january and completed death sentences for one @entity10 woman and four men from @entity181 , @entity193 , @entity223 and the @entity184 port of no return : @entity225 ( above ) on @entity102 was the dropping off point on wednesday for the @entity3 @entity24 duo before being taken by road on to the prison where they are currently being held in isolation dressed in simple , white clothing , they are accompanied by a physician , clergy and an ' execution attorney ' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner			1
in the case of @entity37 , the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth			1
at a clearing , three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner			0
when the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready , the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing , sitting or kneeling for their execution			0
a black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to ' calm down ' before the execution takes place			0
although a clergyman of the prisoner 's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites , @entity181 @entity180 was reportedly denied access to @entity27 's catholic priest @entity265 and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner , but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to @entity97 .			0

the likely place on the island for the @entity13 9 duo 's execution is called @entity37
it 's also known as ' @entity32 ' because it is found in the middle of a jungle clearing with the only sign of a weathered hut
the grassy area is *fringed* by citrus orchards and banana palms
it is only 3km from @entity77 prison , the island 's most secure *facility*
the @entity3 ' final journey will be up a steep , winding dirt track
