over-optimistic forecasts for passenger demand have left taxpayers ' saddled with £ 4.8billion of debt ' over the @entity5 rail link , a report by @entity7 said today			1
these ' unrealistic estimates ' for the @entity10 to @entity12 link must not be repeated when the business case is made for the proposed @entity10 to @entity15 high - speed line , the report said			1
total taxpayer support for the 68 - mile @entity19 over the period to 2070 is likely to be £ 10.2billion , the report from the @entity17 added			1
a train passes over the @entity22 in @entity23 on its way into @entity10 using the @entity25			0
taxpayers have been ' saddled with £ 4.8billion of debt ' due to over-optimistic forecasts for passenger demand , a report said today international passenger numbers on @entity19 are only a third of the 1995 original forecast and two - thirds of the level the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) forecast in 1998 , said the committee			1
it went on : ' over-optimistic and unrealised forecasts for passenger demand on @entity19 left the taxpayer saddled with £ 4.8 ' billion of debt			1
' the report added that the delivery of regeneration benefits from @entity19 , on which high - speed @entity44 trains travel , ' suffered from a lack of effective leadership from the centre '			1
the committee said the department ' does not have sufficient understanding of the economic impact and regeneration benefits of transport infrastructure , compared with alternatives , so is not able to make fully informed investment decisions '			0
the report added that the @entity35 ' gives insufficient attention to evaluating its major projects ' and should develop evaluation frameworks for all current major projects including the under - construction @entity62 scheme and @entity15			1
the @entity65 company was awarded the contract to build @entity19 in 1996			0
the @entity35 agreed to restructure the deal in 1998 , guaranteeing most of @entity65 ’s debt , after @entity44 revenues were substantially below @entity65 ’s forecasts			2
commenting on the report today , @entity17 chairman @entity71 said : ' while @entity19 provides an efficient service , contributing in an important way to @entity77 transport infrastructure , there were costly mistakes in the history of the project			2
these must not be repeated with @entity15			0
' @entity19 was supposed to pay for itself but instead the taxpayer has had to pay out £ 4.8billion so far to cover the debt on the project			2
' @entity19 hub : @entity85 in central @entity10			2
international passenger numbers on @entity19 are only a third of the 1995 original forecast bullet train : the report added that the delivery of regeneration benefits from @entity19 , on which high - speed @entity44 trains travel , ' suffered from a lack of effective leadership from the centre ' she went on : ' the root of the problem is the inaccurate and wildly optimistic forecasts for passenger numbers			1
' the @entity35 failed to take into account the growth of low - cost airlines or the competitive response of the ferry companies			0
' this is n’t the first time that over-optimistic planning and insufficiently robust testing of planning assumptions has got the department into trouble			0
my committee ’s report on the @entity116 raised similar concerns			0
' ms @entity71 said some of the @entity35 ’s assumptions about the benefits of faster travel were ' simply untenable '			0
' for example , the time business travellers save by using high - speed rail is valued at £ 54 per hour yet the time commuters save getting to and from work is only valued at £ 7 per hour			1
' it is difficult to see how this can be justified			0
the department also assumes that all time spent on a train is unproductive			0
and unrealistic assumptions about ticket prices act to exaggerate passenger demand forecasts			0
' ms @entity71 continued : ' the @entity35 also told us that it had not considered the benefits and costs of alternatives to @entity15 such as investment in broadband video - conferencing or investment in alternative , more local train routes			1
' it is nonsense that the @entity35 does not have a full understanding of the wider economic impact and regeneration benefits of transport infrastructure , including @entity19 , to inform future investment decisions			2
go - ahead : transport secretary @entity150 visits @entity85 in january to give the green light to the controversial @entity15 high - speed rail project @entity15 protest : a sign marks the spot in the @entity157 village of @entity158 where a new rail bridge is proposed to be built ' all these things are crucial for proving the case for investment in long - distance travel and demonstrating value for money			1
' the department must revisit its assumptions on @entity15 and develop a full understanding of the benefits and costs of high - speed travel compared to the alternatives			1
' a @entity35 spokesman said : ' as this report recognises , @entity19 is a successful and central part of our transport infrastructure , carrying millions of passengers a year from a regenerated @entity85 ( station in @entity10 ) to the east of @entity181 and the continent			1
' it was delivered on time and on budget and this report commends the " exemplary " way the sale of the line was handled - generating more than £ 2billion for the taxpayer , far exceeding market expectations			2
' the spokesman added : ' our passenger forecast modelling has improved significantly since the original work for @entity19 over 20 years ago , with better understanding of what drives passenger demand , better computer modelling and more computer power to do it			2
' @entity201 predicts the @entity202 will be full by the mid- 2020s and @entity15 presents the most effective solution to this looming capacity crunch facing our rail network			0
this is in addition to the jobs , regional regeneration and improved connectivity the project will deliver			0
' @entity213 , director of the @entity214 ’ @entity212 , said : ' we have long been concerned about the vast cost and poor value for taxpayers ’ money offered by the government ’s @entity15 project and this report only underlines our worries			0
' the committee has exposed how inaccurate passenger forecasts for @entity19 are costing the taxpayer billions and there remains a real of danger of history repeating itself with @entity15			1
' he went on : ' @entity35 case for @entity15 is based on a number of flawed assumptions , including a new set of unrealistic passenger forecasts , but ministers are preparing to spend £ 32billion on what risks being a humongous white elephant			1
' there are higher priorities than a train line that will only benefit a fortunate minority , while costing well over £ 1,000 for every family in @entity77			0
' it would be a dereliction of duty of the part of the government if it does not follow the committee ’s advice and conduct a thorough cost benefit analysis of @entity15 before another single penny of taxpayers ’ money is spent on the project			0

' unrealistic estimates ' for @entity10 to @entity12 link must not be repeated when business case is made for proposed @entity10 to @entity15 high - speed line , report by @entity7 says
taxpayer support for 68 - mile @entity19 over period to 2070 is likely to be £ 10.2bn
international passenger numbers on @entity19 only a third of 1995 original forecast and two - thirds of level @entity35 forecast in 1998
