sometimes being a cat can be a tiring life : all those catnaps between bouts of idle stretching in front of the fire			2
but @entity7 the ginger tom has found a way to get round the tiresome business of walking anywhere , by hopping on the bus			1
the 15 - year - old sits on bemused passengers ’ laps as the bus makes round trips of up to ten miles from @entity15 to @entity16 in @entity17			2
where 's your ticket ? @entity7 the cat has been riding the bus for free by hopping on and off at his local station in @entity17 he is such a regular passenger that some of the drivers take tins of cat food to feed him			1
they even know which stop to let him off at so he can return to his home and owner @entity34			0
mrs @entity35 , 44 , believes @entity7 , named after the @entity7 in @entity36 , first took a liking to the buses ’ warmth			1
she said : ‘ we moved here 19 months ago and our house backs on to the bus station			0
he is an old boy and is very friendly			0
waiting for his bus : dodger waits at the station before slowly creeping in the bus to make his journey @entity48 's take on the travelling cat ' sometimes he just sits in the @entity50 and waits for the bus to turn up before he gets on			1
' ' but then he started climbing on board the buses because they are almost like greenhouses when it is sunny			0
' then last week i found out he had travelled to @entity16 and back , which is a 10 mile round trip			0
' i had n’t seen him all morning until my daughter @entity58 told me one of her friends had just seen him on the bus at @entity16			0
' i could n’t believe it and panicked			0
i got into my car to go off and look for him and then at that moment the bus pulled up near our house and low and behold he got off			0
' he had fallen asleep on board and nobody knew about it			0
when the driver realised he knew who @entity7 was and where he lived and kept him on board			2
' that afternoon i saw @entity7 climb on board another bus and i rushed to tell the driver			1
' i was shocked when she told me @entity7 was always on there and liked to sit on the seats because they are warm from where people have been sitting			1
popular passenger : dodger likes to sleep on paying passengers laps and even gets fed cat food by the bus driver sometimes proud owner : @entity34 cuddles her cat once he 's home from his bus trip ' the drivers buy cat food for him and he sits on people ’s laps			1
' sometimes he just sits in the @entity50 and waits for the bus to turn up before he gets on			0
' @entity7 is familiar to regular bus passengers and drivers , but mrs @entity35 still receives several calls a week asking if she has lost a ginger cat			1
a spokesman for bus firm first said they did n’t mind @entity7 on their buses but did n’t actively encourage him			1
he said : ' the drivers have been asked not to feed it because we recognise that cat has an owner and we do not want to discourage it from returning home for food and shelter			1
' but in principle we do not have a problem with it being around the bus station			0
' given this cat is elderly we suspect it would be eligible for free travel , perhaps a bus puss , if such a thing existed			2
' another bus - hopping cat , called @entity127 , died last year after being hit by a car while crossing the road to board the @entity131 service in @entity132 .			2

@entity7 is fed cat food by some of the drivers
owner thinks he likes the bus because it 's warm
