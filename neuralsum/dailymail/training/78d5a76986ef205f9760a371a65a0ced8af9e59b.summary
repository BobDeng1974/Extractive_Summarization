by @entity0 published : 17:23 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 18:07 est , 21 april 2013 @entity1 always hated being ' a big girl '			1
but at 5ft 9in tall and weighing 13½ stone , that was how her friends and family referred to her — until now			1
@entity1 , 47 , lives in @entity7 with her husband , @entity9 , 48 , and their 23 - year - old daughter , @entity10			1
she bought the 2 - day diet book in february when it was serialised in the @entity13 and has stuck to it ever since			1
' in the first week i lost 7lb , ' she says			1
' the change was so dramatic that it was almost frightening			1
' slimline : @entity18 is losing an astonishing 7lbs a week on the 2 - day diet which advocates fasting twice a week the 2 - day summer diet : all new recipes in your mail she has shed more than 21lb so far and is determined not to stop until she reaches her 11 - stone goal			1
' in fact , even when i get there i ’m not going to stop , ' she says			1
' this has changed my life and this is how i eat now			1
' her impetus to lose weight came when @entity1 was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006			1
she had a mastectomy and was told by her gp that if she lost a bit of weight she could reduce the chance of the cancer returning			1
' i tried @entity42 and @entity43 , but it never worked , ' she says			2
@entity18 works as a printer and the long hours and 6am starts meant she kept up her energy levels with chocolate , crisps and endless rounds of supermarket sandwiches			2
the 2 - day diet meant changing her eating habits completely : ' now i count out 15 squares of chocolate each week and wrap five squares in clingfilm in three portions — that ’s my three treats for non-diet days if i want them			1
' i cook brown pasta and smother it in chilli tomato sauce ( i ’ve never used so much chilli and garlic in my life ! ) and roast a load of vegetables and throw them into a frittata , ' she says			2
' i love not being " the big girl " any more , but the most incredible thing is how healthy i feel			2
i sleep brilliantly without waking up hungry , i ’ve lost the hormonal mood swings and i feel so happy			1
' this is by far the easiest diet i ’ve ever done			2
it has changed my life			2
i just wish i ’d known about it years ago			2
' picky : with the 2 - day diet you do n't have to make difficult choices and allow yourself the odd treat as spring finally breaks , it ’s time to consign those boots , coats and jumpers to the attic and start thinking about a summer wardrobe — and a summer body			1
and if you ’re keen to shed a few pounds , there ’s no better way than the @entity13 ’s 2 - @entity89			2
when we unveiled the @entity76 earlier this year , thousands joined the revolution , losing weight and becoming healthier			2
now , whether you ’re already on the plan and want to give it a boost with fabulous new meal options , or you ’re starting from scratch , the 2 - day summer diet is the perfect way to slim for summer parties and the beach			0
we began the new stage of the diet in saturday ’s @entity13 with a fabulous 32 - page booklet packed with exciting recipes to tempt you			0
in today ’s paper , we have even more dishes to keep you on the straight and narrow			0
the beauty is that you have to diet for only two consecutive days a week			1
just 48 hours of low - carb , low - calorie meals in every seven days will help retrain your appetite for good			0
during the other five days you can enjoy delicious @entity117 - style meals			0
the 2 - day summer diet is the brainchild of award - winning dietitian dr @entity120 , who specialises in food and exercise plans to prevent breast cancer , and renowned oncologist professor @entity124 , research director of the @entity127 @entity126 ’s @entity125			0
their diet is unique because it has been clinically tested and proven to be more effective at shifting fat and easier to stick to than daily calorie - counting			0
it also leads to dramatic health improvements			0
dr @entity120 and prof @entity124 ’s studies showed a reduction in cancer risk for those who tried the 2 - day diet			0
they also found it triggered a more dramatic drop in the hormone insulin than a conventional all - week - long diet			1
though insulin is vital for regulating sugar levels in the body , an excess is believed to be the root of many weight - related health problems — not just @entity151 diabetes , but also heart disease , some cancers ( particularly breast cancer ) and possibly dementia			0
the 2 - day diet has also been specifically designed to stop you feeling hungry and so you do not have to count calories			0
you just avoid certain foods and stick within portion limits on others			0
diet days are low in carbohydrates ( bread , pasta , potatoes ) , which can make you feel hungry			0
a low - carb diet also boosts fat - burning : when carbohydrates are kept to a minimum , your body quickly shifts from storing fat to burning it			0
on non-diet days , dr @entity120 and professor @entity124 suggest you opt for healthy @entity117 - style meals , which should include plenty of fresh produce , including fruit and vegetables , healthy fats and dairy products			0
their blueprint should re-educate you to eat in the healthiest way possible , boosting the benefits of diet days and establishing eating habits that should keep you trim — for ever			0
