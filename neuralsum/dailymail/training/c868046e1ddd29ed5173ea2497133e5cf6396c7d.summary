by @entity0 pointless ? research has found taking flu tablets could prolong your illness and make you more contagious @entity5 and flu remedies may make you feel better but your friends and colleagues wo n’t thank you for taking them			1
scientists say that while aspirin , paracetamol and ibuprofen make the person taking them feel better by lowering their temperature , they may also make the bug easier to spread			0
as a result , more people will catch it			2
the @entity21 researchers calculated that tablets taken to ease the sweats and chills of flu are to blame for at least one in 20 cases of the illness – and many deaths			1
they say that rather than taking pills to lower their temperature , people with flu should stay at home , get plenty of rest and have some hearty soup			1
however , @entity37 experts questioned their sums			1
the researchers , from @entity40 in @entity41 , first gathered together studies on the biology of flu			2
this included one which showed that ferrets release more of the flu virus and are infectious for longer after being given drugs to lower their temperature			0
it is thought that the high temperature of a fever triggers the immune system into fighting the infection			0
without it , the amount of the flu virus in coughs and sneezes increases , making it easier for the bug to spread			0
although ferrets may seem an odd choice of animal to study , their flu symptoms are most similar to those in people			2
the researchers then added in figures on use of paracetamol and other drugs to estimate how much they affect the spread of flu			1
they calculated that in a typical winter in @entity79 , the pills are to blame for 5 per cent of cases and more than 1,000 deaths			1
if same held true for the @entity37 , it would equate to some 200 deaths a year			1
lead researcher , @entity84 , said : ‘ when they have flu , people often take medication that reduces their fever			2
the researchers from @entity40 in @entity41 found high temperatures trigger the body into fighting the illness ‘ no one likes to feel miserable but it turns out that our comfort might be at the cost of infecting others			1
‘ because fever can actually help lower the amount of virus in a sick person ’s body and reduce the chance of transmitting the disease to others , taking drugs that can reduce fever can increase transmission			0
‘ we ’ve discovered that this increase has significant effects when we scale up to the level of the whole population			0
’ the journal @entity113 reports that factoring in the impact of people who take the medicines feeling well enough to go back to work means the impact is likely even greater			2
professor @entity84 said : ‘ people often take – or give their kids – fever - reducing drugs so they can go to work or school			2
‘ they may think the risk of infecting others is lower because the fever is lower			0
‘ in fact , the opposite may be true : the ill people may give off more virus because fever has been reduced			0
’ @entity37 research : scientists at @entity133 also advised it is better to stay home than take medication co-researcher dr @entity137 said the same could be true when the pills are used to ease the symptoms of a heavy cold			1
he said : ‘ do n’t take anti-fever drugs ; stay home and avoid contact with others ; get plenty of rest and eat chicken noodle soup			1
’ @entity148 , professor of family medicine at @entity40 , said : ‘ as always , @entity150 knows best			0
‘ fever is a defence mechanism to protect ourselves and others			0
‘ fever - reducing medication should only be taken to take the edge off discomfort , not to allow people to go out into the community when they should still stay at home			1
‘ people are often advised to take fever - reducing drugs and medical texts state that doing so is harmless			0
‘ this view needs to change			0
’ however , @entity37 experts said that while the @entity21 may have a theoretical point , the spread of flu is much more complex than their calculations allowed for			1
professor @entity170 , a @entity133 flu expert , said : ‘ this may be one factor that influences influenza spread but there are so many factors overall it is difficult to imagine people stopping taking cold cures because of it			0

@entity21 researchers found tablets to blame for 1 in 20 cases of illness
warn people to stay at home , have soup and rest rather than medicate
@entity37 experts *agreed* better to stay home but claim figures more complex
