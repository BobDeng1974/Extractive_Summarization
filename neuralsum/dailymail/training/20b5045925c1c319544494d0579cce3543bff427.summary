a baby girl born out of wedlock must be adopted to save her from the risk of being slaughtered in an ‘ honour killing ’ , a court ruled yesterday			1
if the unmarried @entity10 woman ’s father found out about the child , he would feel such ‘ unimaginable shame ’ he could unleash a vengeful bloodbath by killing the baby and his whole family , three senior judges agreed			1
so they made the extraordinary order to have the one - year - old girl – known as @entity18 – adopted for her own safety			1
safe : @entity18 has settled well with her adoptive parents ( picture posed by models ) she will now grow up with adoptive parents and , when she is older , they will explain to her why she could not have been brought up by her biological parents			0
it is believed to be the first time an @entity31 court has ordered an adoption to prevent a murder			0
the baby ’s maternal grandmother told police that if her husband ever found out about the little girl , ‘ he would consider himself honour - bound to kill the child , the mother , the grandmother herself and the grandmother ’s other children ’ , the court heard			1
the identities of all those involved have been kept anonymous to ensure the girl can grow up safe from her apparently murderous grandfather – who still has no idea his daughter was ever pregnant			2
the astonishing background to the case was set out at the @entity53 in @entity54 yesterday			0
the baby ’s mother – referred to as @entity57 – conceived the child at the end of 2009 when she was having an affair with a married man , known as @entity62 neither the mother nor the father were born in the @entity65 and both came to live here separately within the past ten years			1
they are both @entity10 , but from different cultures			2
at the time of his infidelity , @entity70 ’s wife was still waiting for permission to join him in the @entity65 , though she is now here			0
@entity74 and mrs @entity75 , pictured left and right , along with lord @entity76 said that the child must be adopted when @entity57 suspected she was pregnant , in the spring of 2010 , she was so ‘ terrified ’ of how her ‘ traditional muslim ’ father would react that she concealed her pregnancy by wearing loose clothes			1
she continued living at home and was confident her growing bump would not show unless someone ‘ was looking ’			0
she travelled to ‘ the other side of town ’ for her antenatal care , to avoid her parents finding out , and only had her pregnancy confirmed at 23 weeks			0
eventually she confided in her mother and a sister , and they hatched a secret plan that when she went into labour , someone would call her father away on a pretext , to ensure he never found out			2
she also told social services she wanted the baby to be adopted straight away			1
@entity18 was born in the autumn of 2010			0
at just a few hours old , baby and mother were parted as @entity57 was discharged from hospital and baby q was left in the care of nursing staff			2
by december , she was placed in the care of the @entity10 couple who are now about to adopt her			2
the court case came about because the baby ’s natural father , @entity70 , discovered he had a daughter and wanted to take custody of her himself			1
but a high court judge , mrs @entity114 , rejected him as unsuitable in july this year , and said the baby would still be ‘ at risk ’ of an honour killing because ‘ two and two might easily be put together ’ by the maternal grandfather or someone who knew him			2
the baby was ‘ quite obviously ’ not the child of @entity70 ’s wife , the judge said , adding : ‘ if the grandfather ’s community were thus to find out about the relationship between @entity57 and @entity70 , it would be a matter of intense almost unimaginable shame to him and his family			1
’ there was a ‘ very significant risk ’ he might launch a violent attack to preserve the family ’s honour			0
adoption : the @entity137 ruled the risk was so grave that the baby could not be looked after by her natural father the court heard mrs justice @entity114 had been ‘ persuaded by the evidence of the police ’ that the mother and baby q could be at ‘ a very high level of risk ’ if the baby ’s birth was to become known in the wider community			1
the police force in question was not identified , nor the social services department involved in the case			0
but the court was told that social workers , police and the mother of baby q were all in agreement that she should be adopted			1
still hopeful of taking custody of his child , @entity70 launched an appeal , but this was rejected yesterday by three senior judges , @entity74 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
they agreed with the first judge that there were several good reasons why @entity70 and his wife – who now have a baby of their own – should not be allowed to bring up baby @entity175 among them was the ‘ tension ’ that would be caused by @entity70 ’s wife looking after her philandering husband ’s illegitimate child as well as her own			1
both @entity70 and his wife also lacked ‘ empathy and insight ’ , and were criticised as being incapable of dealing with the little girl ’s feelings as she grew older and wanted to learn the details of her ‘ very unfortunate start in life ’			1
the judges concluded : ‘ the risks – physical , emotional , short and long term – are too great for q to be brought up by her father			0
’ although @entity70 and his wife ’s ‘ care and warmth ’ towards their own child was taken into account , the judges concluded there was ‘ a high likelihood ’ they would feel differently about baby @entity175 by contrast , baby q had quickly developed a deep attachment to her adoptive parents , known as @entity208 and mrs a , @entity10 who live in the @entity65 but come from the same country as the baby ’s mother			1
they had a ‘ high degree of empathy , sympathy , insight and maturity ’ , and the judges said they had ‘ absolute confidence in @entity208 and mrs a to give q information about her background , her life , what happened to her mother , the feelings of her father , her father ’s wishes for her , and the fact she has another family			2
’ mr and mrs a have taken baby q ‘ into their family and community ... and into their hearts ’ , it was said			0
every year in the @entity65 , officials estimate that at least a dozen women are victims of honour killings , almost exclusively within @entity244 and @entity245 families			0
a 2006 @entity247 poll for the @entity248 in the @entity65 found that one in ten of the 500 young @entity250 polled said that they could condone the killing of someone who dishonoured their family .			0

unmarried mother ran away after becoming pregnant because she *feared* what her father would do
one - year - old baby girl will be adopted by @entity10 family
natural father wanted child to live with him and his wife
