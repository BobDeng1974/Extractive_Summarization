a landowner whose mp brother claimed expenses for cleaning a moat is embroiled in a planning row over the road to his 18th century country manor			1
@entity9 's son @entity8 , 63 , started work without planning permission on a ' minimal ' upgrade to an entrance of @entity13 * - listed @entity14 near @entity15 , @entity16			1
but the work prompted a complaint from neighbours who live next to the road - in his 100 - acre estate 's @entity13 - listed former gatehouse			1
dispute : this gatepost is the centre of a row between @entity8 , the brother of an expenses - claiming mp , and the couple who live at the former gatehouse ( pictured ) of his 100 - acre estate in @entity16 's @entity33 estate : a satellite image showing @entity14 ( left ) , the access road and the junction in dispute ( right ) mr @entity8 said his builders were simply putting a kerb on the road , but neighbours @entity43 and @entity44 said it looked like ' a large lay - by '			1
and they said it could increase the number of lorries using their local entrance to the estate , which has other entrances , risking damage to the @entity13 - listed gateposts next to their home			1
@entity33 sent enforcement officers and the work has now been halted until the council decides whether mr @entity8 should be granted retrospective planning permission			1
mr @entity8 is the son of the @entity60 , a prominent politician who served as @entity61 , education secretary and lord high chancellor before his death in 2001 aged 94			2
his brother @entity64 , now the third @entity65 , was an agriculture minister under @entity66 but stepped down from the @entity67 in 2010 after his expenses were exposed			1
' @entity69 - by ' : photos were submitted to @entity33 to show the extent of the works so far after @entity8 's neighbours @entity43 and @entity44 complained roadworks had ruined their country view in one of the most notorious incidents in the @entity80 ' expenses scandal , @entity64 agreed to repay the Â£ 2,200 cost of cleaning a moat at his country home after he charged it to the taxpayer			1
@entity8 was not implicated in the row , but also owns a large estate			2
built on the site of a former 10th century abbey , @entity14 is on a 100 - acre island in the middle of the @entity92 and is used as a wedding venue			1
in a letter to planners , mr @entity8 's agent said the work was ' de minimis ' - latin for small - scale			1
he added : ' the access road itself does not require consent as it has been in existence for at least the period of current ownership beginning in 1990 , and was indeed used by the present owners ( the applicant ) when moving in as the only viable route for removal vans			0
' the proposal is to construct a kerb which will limit the spread of the existing scalpings used to formulate the road and delineate its line on a permanent basis			2
' the road already exists and the central philosophy of this project is simply to maintain and improve it			0
controversy : a plan showing the proposed road , which would run to the south of the the @entity13 - listed gateposts ( centre right ) which are next to the former gatehouse ( in black ) where the neighbours live ' this will make it more usable as the current arrangement is slightly too small for the use of normal delivery vehicles			1
' but father - of - two mr @entity134 , 57 , who has lived with his wife in the @entity14 's former gatehouse for 24 years , said the work had disrupted what was ' until a few months ago a green paddock '			1
he said : ' it is now a monstrosity			0
it has pretty well finished			0
it is an eyesore - it is a hell of a mess			0
it is absolute nonsense to say it has been there since 1990			0
it was a fenced paddock			0
' we rang the council and asked if they needed planning permission and the council came down and said he needed permission			0
' the council then spoke to mr @entity8 and the work stopped			1
mr @entity8 has now put in these applications			2
' in a letter to @entity33 , @entity8 and mrs @entity44 added : ' the applications make reference to the access road to the south of the listed gateposts as being in existence since 1990			2
family : @entity8 's father @entity60 ( left ) served as @entity170 before his death aged 94 in 2001			2
his mp brother @entity64 ( right ) , now 3rd @entity65 , claimed expenses for moat - cleaning ' during our residency we have witnessed a gradual , progressive and unauthorised opening up of an alternative entrance to the south of the listed gateposts to allow access by @entity181 and other traffic to serve the growing business demands of @entity14			1
' it can clearly be seen from the road [ and ] it totally detracts from what was a pleasing view of historic parkland ... to all intents and purposes it resembles a large lay - by			2
' they added : ' we are convinced and extremely concerned that this development unless reversed will lead to significantly increased levels of traffic passing within feet of our home			0
' @entity198 chairman @entity197 said : ' we need to look into this			0
it is a shame because we obviously hate neighbour disputes and we like to feel common sense prevails			0
' a @entity33 spokesman said : ' this matter was brought to our attention and investigated by our enforcement team			0
' the applicant was then advised planning permission was required for it			0
retrospective applications were then made			0
' the council is expected to make its decision in the summer			0
mr @entity8 has been contacted for comment .			2
