by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:05 am on 6th july 2011 the four astronauts who will close @entity4 's 30 - year space shuttle programme aboard @entity5 arrived at the @entity6 yesterday			1
waving @entity8 flags , they saluted @entity10 's 235th birthday and paid tribute to the engineers who contributed to the space shuttles			2
the launch countdown for the final flight of the final shuttle begins today , ahead of friday ’s lift - off at 11:26am local time ( 4:26pm gmt ) before an estimated crowd of one million people			1
scroll down for a history of the @entity4 shuttle programme flying the flag : the crew on @entity5 ' final mission ( from left to right ) commander @entity26 , pilot @entity27 , mission specialist @entity28 and @entity29 at @entity6 yesterday but the euphoria over the launch is sparked a debate over whether it heralds the end of the space age amid claims @entity4 will significantly scale down its operations due to cost			1
the @entity38 in the @entity10 and the economist newspaper in @entity40 both argued that explorations into space peaked a long time ago and were unlikely to ever increase			0
however , this debate was not on the mind of commander @entity44 and his crew			0
at the weekend they were given the small @entity10 flags as launch director @entity48 greeted them on the runway at the @entity6 in @entity51 , @entity52 , on their arrival from their training base in @entity56			2
commander @entity26 , a retired @entity58 captain , told the photographers and journalists swarming on the runway : ' this is a day that 's decidedly @entity10 , a day where we kind of reflect on our independence and all the wonderful things that we really have as a part of being @entity10			2
‘ it 's wonderful that you 've all came out to join us			2
' altogether , about 2,500 members of the news media have requested credentials to cover the launch			0
estimates of the crowd at the launch on friday have also risen			2
@entity4 spokesman @entity80 said between 750,000 and one million people are expected to witness the end of shuttle history			1
preparing for launch : commander @entity26 climbs out of his t - 38 aircraft after arriving at @entity6 from the astronauts ' training base in @entity56 , @entity88 lift - off of the shuttle , manned by a minimal crew of four astronauts , is set for 11.26am ( 4.26pm gmt ) on friday that is considerably more than the number who turned up for @entity97 's last lift - off in february and @entity98 's in may			1
commander @entity26 said the four - man crew - there are usually six on a shuttle - have a very busy 12 - day flight ahead			1
@entity5 will make a supply run to the @entity105 , before joining @entity97 and @entity98 in retirement			0
‘ when it 's all over ... we 'll be very proud to put the right - hand bookend on the space shuttle programme , ’ he said			1
co-pilot @entity27 said : ' we 're so very proud to be here sharing our nation 's birthday with you all and the folks here at @entity6 , and we just want to honour the entire @entity6 team that has worked on these magnificent machines over the last 30 - plus years			1
’ @entity4 has n't launched a shuttle with so few astronauts since 1983			1
the reduction is because there are no more shuttles to retrieve them from the space station in the event of serious launch damage to @entity5 ; the shuttle crew would have to be rescued by @entity129 's much smaller @entity128 capsules			2
tight security : an armed @entity132 member stands guard as the members of the @entity135 arrived at the shuttle landing facility yesterday practice run : a ground crew member signals space shuttle @entity141 commander @entity26 to a stop in his t - 38 jet @entity10 will continue to hitch rides aboard @entity128 spacecraft to and from the space station , until private companies are able to launch their own spacecraft with crews			2
that 's at least three to five years away			2
the @entity152 administration wants @entity4 to focus on expeditions to an asteroid and @entity155 , instead of repeated trips to low - @entity158 orbit			1
there 's not enough money to do both , shuttle programme manager @entity159 told reporters last week			1
‘ we 're sacrificing the shuttle to enable us to be able to take that next step , ’ mr @entity159 said			2
‘ if we were going to retire the shuttle , this is the time to do it , ’ he said , noting that the space station is now completed and in good shape			0
one more mission : @entity4 has approved shuttle @entity5 for a final run to the @entity105 on july 8 despite the overriding significance of this last shuttle flight , astronaut @entity29 was delighting in the little things			1
he said : ' it 's such a pleasure to come down here when you have a rocket on the pad and it 's got your stuff loaded on it			0
' the three men - all with military backgrounds - are joined on the crew by @entity28 , a civilian scientist			0
each has flown in space before			0
the @entity5 flight was added to the shuttle 's schedule last year to buy time in case @entity4 's newly hired cargo delivery companies have problems getting their spacecraft into orbit			1
@entity5 will be delivering a year 's worth of food , clothing , science equipment and supplies to the @entity105 , a $ 100billion project shared by 16 nations which circles 220 miles above @entity158			2
distinguished career : @entity5 sits atop the @entity204 while returning to the @entity6 after a ten - month refurbishment in 1998 debut : @entity5 lifts off from @entity6 on its first mission in october 1985 last tuesday , the threat of an orbital debris impact interrupted the station 's preparations for the visit			1
@entity4 learned that an unidentified piece of space debris was likely to pass close to the station and told the crew to seek shelter in the station 's two @entity129 @entity128 escape capsules			1
typically , the station manoeuvres to avoid potential debris impacts , but the notice came just 14 hours before the closest approach , too late to plan and conduct an avoidance manoeuvre			0
@entity224 , @entity4 's space operations chief , said : ' we think it came within about 1,100ft of the space station			1
it was probably the closest object that 's actually come by the space station			0
' the six crew members divided into two groups of three and sealed themselves into the @entity128 capsules about 20 minutes before the object came closest to the station			0
it was only the second time in the station 's history that crews had to seek shelter in their ' lifeboats ' for an orbital debris threat			0
the station 's two @entity10 crew members are preparing for a spacewalk during shuttle 's @entity5 ' eight - day stay , a job normally undertaken by the visiting astronauts			1
long history : @entity5 in orbit , as seen from the @entity129 @entity248 in june 1995 @entity4 , however , has been trying to keep the @entity5 crew 's training as simple as possible , as the four shuttle astronauts already are having to do the work of the six or seven people normally assigned to shuttle flights			1
@entity255 and @entity256 are scheduled to begin cargo deliveries to the station next year			0
@entity4 is hoping commercial companies will be able to fly astronauts as well , though those spaceships are not expected to be ready for at least four to five years			2
meanwhile , @entity4 will pay @entity129 to fly its astronauts to the station at a cost of more than $ 50million per person			2
the space shuttle was sold to @entity10 as cheap , safe and reliable			0
it was none of those			0
it cost $ 196billion over 40 years , ended the lives of 14 astronauts and managed to make less than half the flights promised			0
@entity4 's first space shuttle flight was in april 1981			1
the 135th and final launch is set for friday			0
once @entity5 lands at the end of a 12 - day mission , it and the other two remaining shuttles are officially museum pieces - more expensive than any paintings			0
the total price tag for the programme was more than twice the $ 90billion @entity4 originally calculated			1
soon - to - be - retired : @entity5 undocks from the @entity105 in september 2006 six years ago , then - @entity4 chief @entity283 even called the shuttle programme a mistake			1
but as a mistake it is one that paid off in wildly unexpected ways that were n't about money and reliability			0
' the discoveries it enabled , the international co-operation it fostered and the knowledge it gained - often at great human cost - has also contributed in countless , important ways to humanity and our common progress , ' former president @entity291 said			0
mr @entity300 oversaw the programme 's early days as vice-president , a job that has traditionally included supervising @entity4			1
@entity305 science policy professor @entity304 , who studies shuttle costs and policies , said there are probably other ways the @entity10 could have spent several billion dollars a year on a human space programme and gained more			1
when the shuttle succeeded , it did so in a spectacular way			0
but its failures were also large and tragic			0
seven astronauts died when @entity316 exploded about a minute after launch in 1986 and seven more died when @entity319 burned up as it returned to @entity158 in 2003			0
one out of every 67 flights ended in death - a fatality rate that would make the most ardent daredevil cringe			0
based on deaths per million miles travelled , the space shuttle is 138 times riskier than a passenger jet			0
former astronaut and past @entity4 associate administrator @entity327 said : ‘ while the shuttle is the most magnificent engineering feat , its complexity and the naive belief that it would be as safe as an airliner was its @entity334			1
' the concept behind it was based on a three - step space plan , ultimately ending on @entity155 , said @entity337 , the former top official who is credited as the father of the space shuttle programme			1
to get to @entity155 , @entity4 needed a space station circling @entity158 as a jumping - off point			1
in 1971 , president @entity342 gave @entity4 only the shuttle			1
it had no place to go			0
the space station was n't built until 1998			0
budget cuts ordered by the @entity347 meant that the fuel tank would be jettisoned with each flight and the boosters would fall into the ocean after launch and have to be retrieved and refurbished extensively			0
the shuttle will likely go down in history as an anomaly of @entity10 's space programme .			2
