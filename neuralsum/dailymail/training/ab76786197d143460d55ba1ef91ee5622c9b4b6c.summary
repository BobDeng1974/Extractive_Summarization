by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:43 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 06:54 est , 11 august 2012 there can be no greater contrast between their respective sports			0
one is genteel and elegant , the other two brutal and frenzied			0
but yesterday @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 all found themselves in the same position , making @entity12 history for @entity13			1
in a bizarre twist , the latest gold rush came on a day when it emerged that staff working on @entity31 bulletins had been sent a memo urging them to focus more on the achievements of other countries , and not just @entity17 the message was sent by head of news @entity38 , following a complaint by director general @entity41 , who is said to be ‘ increasingly unhappy ’ with the patriotic tone of the news coverage of the @entity44			1
the @entity31 has been widely praised for its @entity12 programmes , hosted by sports presenters including @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
last night a @entity31 source told the @entity51 : ' this is most definitely not about the sports coverage – it has been flawless – and it is certainly not meant to denigrate the sterling work of the presenters			2
' this is about our @entity57 and @entity58 news			0
we want to make sure the entire games is covered			0
' the memo irritated staff and last night the 6pm news still began with the news of the @entity66 success , although the 10pm bulletin led on @entity69 ’s success in the 200m			1
after a wednesday without any medals , the triple win reinvigorated @entity17 ’s campaign , taking the number of golds won by the host nation to 25 , the highest for 104 years			1
it also raised the overall medal tally to 52 – well above the target of 48			0
memo anger : the message was sent by head of news @entity38 , following a complaint by director general @entity41			0
@entity6 , 27 , who already had a gold medal from team dressage , was the last competitor to go in the packed @entity88 arena			1
she rode her horse @entity90 to victory accompanied by movie themes including the @entity93 and @entity94 , and patriotic @entity66 tunes such as @entity96 and i vow to @entity98 , my country			0
‘ it is unbelievable , ’ she said			0
‘ it is always something i ’ve known the horse could achieve , but i did n’t really know how i was going to find the atmosphere and the expectation			0
’ she pipped @entity107 rider @entity106 while @entity13 ’s @entity108 , another team gold medallist , took bronze			1
@entity6 became only the fourth @entity66 woman to win double gold at one games after @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
over at the @entity120 , the @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 were all among the crowd to see 29 - year - old @entity7 , from @entity122 , pull off an unexpected win by outclassing three - times world champion @entity124			1
winner : @entity6 came first in the individual dressage and her fellow @entity17 rider @entity108 took the bronze history : @entity13 's @entity7 becomes the first woman to win @entity12 boxing gold after victory over @entity133 at @entity120 proud : @entity8 became @entity135 s youngest @entity12 champion at @entity136 as the 19 - year - old nicknamed the ' @entity138 ' claimed taekwondo gold later at the same venue , 19 - year - old @entity8 became @entity17 ’s youngest gold winner when she beat @entity144 ’s @entity143 6 - 4 in the final of the taekwondo under - 57kg featherweight category			1
@entity13 ’s third sailing medal is also assured as @entity149 and @entity150 are guaranteed at least silver in the 470 class			2
the pair are due to go for gold today against an @entity155 crew after their final race was delayed owing to lack of wind at @entity159 yesterday			0
in the message to @entity31 staff , titled ' an order from the @entity163 ' , director of news @entity38 wrote : ' @entity41 is increasingly unhappy that we are focusing far too much on @entity17 's performance to the exclusion of all else			1
' this is also becoming a theme within the @entity170			0
' as editor in chief , he has issued a directive that this needs to change from today			0
so you need to get cracking on making that shift			0
' @entity31 news editors were irritated at the tone of miss @entity38 's email			2
one insider told the @entity51 : ' we never get direct orders like this			0
' it is only natural that our viewers and listeners want to hear about @entity17 's successes			2
all the other countries celebrate their own medal winners			0
' it would be a shame if we had to water down our coverage to satisfy an abstract notion of fairness			0
' indeed , last night 's @entity57 bulletin led on the two golds for boxer @entity7 and dressage rider @entity6			1
result ! @entity117 beams as she applauds the victory as she sits with mp @entity197 and rower sir @entity198 on one side and sir @entity201 and @entity118 on the other raised the roof : @entity119 was also among the thousands of spectators who roared @entity21 to victory in @entity207 's @entity120 filling up medal cabinet : @entity13 's third sailing medal is also assured as @entity149 and @entity150 are guaranteed at least silver in the 470 class the @entity12 coverage has come as a welcome success for the corporation after its @entity216 presentation in june was attacked for being inaccurate and banal , and attracted almost 5,000 complaints			1
writing on the @entity31 's own online message board , viewers were quick to defend the @entity31 's coverage of the @entity44 against charges of ' jingoism '			2
one wrote : ' if you ca n't blow your own vuvuzela when you 're the host nation , when can you ? ' i think it 's been a great games so far ... exceeded all expectations for me , and though the @entity230 messed up the @entity216 on a grand scale , they have redeemed themselves with the fantastic coverage this week			1
' last night mr @entity41 said : ' i am as delighted as our audiences and the whole @entity31 team about the brilliant performance of @entity17 , and it is quite wrong to suggest otherwise			1
' the @entity31 has been right to focus on sporting achievements which the whole country has been celebrating , and we will continue to do so with pride			2
' we can do that while at the same time making sure that our news programmes fully reflect some of the other great sporting achievements and human stories of the @entity44			2
