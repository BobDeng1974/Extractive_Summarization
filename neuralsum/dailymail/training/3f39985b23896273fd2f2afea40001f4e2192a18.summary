@entity1 , 23 , used £ 51,821.34 accidentally transferred into her account by @entity12 to buy expensive designer shoes , handbags and sunglasses in a spending splurge last year			1
after she was caught , a judge spared her jail on the condition she paid the money back by @entity21 , but now she is complaining that the punishment is unfair , and that she has been made an example of because she is attractive			1
in an interview with @entity25 , she said : ' i 've done wrong but i 'm only human , the same as everyone else			0
they 're punishing me because of the way i look			0
' if i was n't much to look at and played the card of " oh , i only get this much a month , i was in a bit of a sticky situation " i reckon i 'd have got a slap on the wrist and just paid back a fiver a week			0
' i pleaded guilty but the only person guilty is the person who put the money in my account			0
i do n't think i should have been punished the way i was			0
' bungling @entity42 , @entity43 , transferred the money into @entity46 account by mistake in april last year instead of paying @entity48			2
@entity1 said she only discovered the money while withdrawing cash on a trip to buy milk , and when she quizzed her bank over the sum , they could n't tell her where it had come from			1
she maintains that she would n't have touched the money had it not been for her ex-boyfriend , who she says took her to @entity58 's @entity57 to spend the cash			0
the pair went to @entity61 where , according to @entity1 , her boyfriend bought thousands of pounds worth of designer clothes , shoes , belts and sunglasses			2
she claims that she initially spent nothing , but on the second day treated herself to a @entity69 bag , a @entity71 bag and belt and @entity74 sunglasses			0
the glamorous single - mother found £ 51,821.34 in her account last year while going to buy a pint of milk that was accidentally transferred to her by @entity12 rather than return the money , she went on a two - day spending spree with her former boyfriend - splurging £ 9,000 in just 48 hours in just 48 hours , she hand spent £ 8,000 on shopping , and used a further £ 1,000 to pay off an outstanding train fine that had built up			1
she also gave her mother £ 1,000 , and had put a further £ 40,000 into savings on the advice of her bank , who were unaware of the council 's mistake			2
meanwhile officials at @entity12 had realised their error , stopped a further £ 44,500 being transferred , and were desperately trying to trace her to explain the error			2
@entity1 says she was out when two men from the council eventually arrived at her mother 's house , but the next day they came back with riot police who surrounded the area			1
she says officers with their tasers drawn handcuffed her , threw her into the back of a riot van , and took her to a police station where she was charged with dishonestly retaining a wrongful credit , which carries up to ten years behind bars			0
@entity1 was spared jail on the condition that she repay the council their money , with interest			1
but she now says the sentence was unfair , and claims she may appeal she called the repayments ' outrageous ' saying that , if anyone should be punished for what happened , it should be the council worker who transferred the cash she pleaded guilty and was taken to @entity120 for sentencing , where @entity122 spared her prison provided she could repay £ 52 , 465.21 - the initial sum , plus £ 643.87 interest			1
@entity1 says she immediately repaid the £ 40,000 she had saved , plus £ 3,600 left in her bank account			1
the council will auction off the items she bought , and then it is up to her to repay the rest			2
she told @entity25 she is putting aside £ 20 a week from working in her parents ' stables , but is considering appealing the terms of her ' unfair ' repayments			0
she added : ' it 's a bit outrageous , is n't it ? my life has been turned upside down by all this			0
the person at @entity12 who did it should n't have a job			0
' they have ruined a part of my life with the stress and abuse i 've been through			2

@entity1 , 23 , had £ 52,000 transferred into account by accident
she then went on shopping spree , spending £ 9,000 in just 48 hours
@entity153 ordered her to repay cash with interest by @entity21 or face jail
now she says court made an example of her because she is *beautiful*
