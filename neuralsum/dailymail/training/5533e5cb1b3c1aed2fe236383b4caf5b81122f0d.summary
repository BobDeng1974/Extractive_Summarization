when you have a sore throat , it ’s natural to reach for all the painkillers you can get your hands on			1
but taking ibuprofen could actually impede recovery , a leading doctor warns			0
@entity12 will dampen the body ’s natural response to a virus causing a sore throat , dr @entity8 , a former gp and co-chair of the @entity11 , argues			1
he advises taking paracetamol and a local anaesthetic spray instead			0
treat a sore throat with paracetamol and an anaesthetic throat spray , but not ibuprofen , dr @entity8 warns			1
a previous study found ibuprofen could prolong the symptoms of coughs , colds and sore throats ‘ for a sore throat , what you do n’t want to do is dampen the body ’s natural defence - the immune system , ’ dr @entity8 told @entity29			1
‘ a few sore throats are caused by secondary infection bacteria , but vast majority are caused by viruses			0
‘ @entity12 and aspirin are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - they dampen the body ’s inflammatory response , the defence system			1
‘ inflammation is the body fighting the germs			1
‘ your throat goes all red from the increasing blood supply – to fight off the virus			1
’ ‘ if you dampen that , you ’re sticking corks on your bayonets			0
’ @entity58 , which is a painkiller but is not an anti-inflammatory , is a better choice , he said			2
this is because it kills the pain of a sore throat without affecting the body ’s immune system			1
dr @entity8 said : ‘ medically , i ’d rather someone dampened the pain , while making sure they drink enough water , staying at home in bed			1
paracetamol and ibuprofen are two of the most common painkillers			2
the two drugs work in different , but complementary ways			0
@entity12 blocks the production of various chemicals in the body			2
these include prostaglandins , which are produced in response to injury or disease and cause inflammation			0
@entity12 taken as pills or in liquid form numbs the site of pain and reduces inflammation , and is widely used for arthritic pain			1
it has a relatively low level of side effects , although it can cause stomach bleeding , kidney damage , allergic reactions			0
it should not be taken by people who are allergic to aspirin			0
paracetamol also blocks prostaglandin , but only in the brain and spinal cord			0
it reduces temperature by acting on the area of the brain responsible for controlling temperature			0
side effects are rare but can include a rash or swelling			0
‘ then you are giving the body a better chance of destroying the virus ‘ if you drink enough and rest enough , and take paracetamol , you give your body the best chance of overcoming it			2
’ a local anaesthetic spray also helps with a sore throat and difficulty swallowing , without affecting the body ’s immune response , he added			1
‘ a local anaesthetic spray , doers the same , it just dampens the nasty feeling of a sore throat , ’ dr @entity8 said			1
‘ you dampen the pain locally without flooding the whole body			2
‘ i had a nasty sore throat recently and i bought some @entity138 anaesthetic throat spray and that helped a lot			1
’ he added that reading the instructions and taking painkillers or sprays as directed is important , and that if in doubt , a patient should visit their gp or see a pharmacist			0
dr @entity8 ’s advice echoes the findings of a @entity152 study carried out last year			1
researchers from the @entity154 found paracetamol is the best treatment for coughs , colds and sore throats			2
treatment with a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen is inadvisable , and ibuprofen may even slow down recovery , they said			0
professor professor @entity166 , of the @entity154 , who led the study , said treatment with ibuprofen could contribute to the progression of the illness			0
he said ' this may have something to do with the fact the ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory			0
' it is possible that the drug is interfering with an important part of the immune response and leads to prolonged symptoms or the progression of symptoms in some individuals			0
' although we have to be a bit cautious since these were surprise findings , for the moment i would personally not advise most patients to use ibuprofen for symptom control for coughs , colds and sore throats			2
' @entity58 is a painkiller but not an anti-inflammatory drug			2
dr @entity8 advises it will kill the pain of a sore cold without dampening the body 's natural immune defence			1

dr @entity8 is a former gp and co-chair of the @entity11
says paracetamol should be used for a sore throat but not ibuprofen
@entity12 is an anti-inflammatory so dampens the body 's immune defense
inflammation such as a red throat is the body 's way of fighting a virus
@entity58 kills pain without affecting the body 's immune system
research has shown that ibuprofen may prolong symptoms of colds
