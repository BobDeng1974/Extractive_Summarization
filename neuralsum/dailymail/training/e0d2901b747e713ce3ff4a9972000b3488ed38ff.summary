a busy life looking after three children @entity13 , 8 , @entity14 , 6 and @entity15 , 5 meant mrs @entity5 often forgot to eat and drink properly , and one night she became ill with and upset stomach and was sick			1

each time her heart stopped , medical teams had to fight to get it beating again - using 200 volt defibrillators , which send electric shock into the heart to get it beating again			1
mrs @entity5 , 34 , has now been diagnosed with @entity35 , a rare heart condition that causes fainting and episodes of abnormally rapid heart rhythm , called arrhythmia			1
if these episodes of arrhythmia persist , if they are not corrected electrically , they can cause cardiac arrest and death			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' i just feel so lucky to be alive - people ca n't believe it when i tell them what happened			1
' ' i did n't have any warning before the attacks happened and i did n't see it coming as i try to stay fit and healthy			0
long qt syndrome is an uncommon but serious heart condition			1
it can cause fainting and episodes of an abnormally rapid heart rhythm , called arrhythmia			1
this happens because the electrical activity of the heart is disrupted â€“ a problem that is either inherited or acquired later in life			2
for example , some drugs antibiotics and antihistamines can trigger it			0
not everyone with long qt syndrome will experience arrhythmia , but when it does happen it can be fatal			2
some people with long qt syndrome will suffer arrythmia known as ' @entity74 ' , when their heart suddenly beats in an abnormally fast , uncontrollable way			1
when this happens , the heart can not pump blood properly and the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen , causing the person to temporarily pass out			2
the torsade de pointes rhythm usually returns to normal within a minute , and the person regains consciousness			2
the heart can not pump blood properly and the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen , causing the person to temporarily pass out			2
the torsade de pointes rhythm usually returns to normal within a minute , and the person regains consciousness			2
these episodes can start at any age and may be triggered by certain things such as stress , a sudden noise , exercise ( especially swimming ) and a slow heart rate during sleep			2
however , there is not always a trigger			0
@entity35 is treated by medication , surgery lifestyle changes , such as eating more potassium			1
source : @entity107 ' i had my three boys one after the other and my main concern is being a good mother to my children			2
' i was more concerned with looking after everybody else and i forgot about myself			0
' i was always running around after the kids and i found myself too busy to eat or drink , i was just surviving off very little			2
' i developed a bit of an upset tummy , and i had painful chest but i just blamed it on breast feeding			0
' i did n't realise my body was shutting down			0
' i woke up in the middle of the night with an extreme thirst , and the rest is a blur			0
' i was woken up by the sound of my boys crying , and i had collapsed on the floor			0
' i had an out of body experience where i saw my partner @entity13 giving me cpr and begging me to start breathing , and i came back around			0
' when the ambulance arrived i had slipped out of consciousnesses again and the staff were performing cpr on me in on the way to hospital			0
' at @entity137 mrs @entity5 was hooked up to drips but doctors found her veins had collapsed and struggled to stabilise her			1
she suffered cardiac arrest after cardiac arrest , leaving doctors fighting every minute to save her life			1
she said : ' i kept having cardiac arrests and each time i came round i was certain i was dying			1
' i looked down at my feet and they were blue , because i had such poor circulation and i was just crying my eyes out at the thought of not seeing my boys again			0
' @entity152 was n't getting to my brain and it was causing me to pass out			0
' i was shocked with the defibrillator each time and i even have a burn on my chest from where i received the 200 volts			0
' after suffering the first few attacks , and being revived again , mrs @entity5 managed recognise when she was about to pass out			2
doctors told her to try coughing which could stabilise her heartbeat , which seemed to work			0
three weeks later , with her condition stable , she was allowed home to her family			0
she now has an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( @entity166 ) fitted , which is similar to a pacemaker			1
if the @entity166 senses that her heart is beating at a potentially dangerous rate , it will deliver an electrical shock , which can help return the heart to a normal rhythm or get it pumping again			1
looking after her three boys @entity13 , 8 , @entity14 , 6 and @entity15 , 5 , meant mrs @entity5 often forgot to eat or drink properly , which led to an upset stomach , sickness , and her first cardiac arrest she has lost 11kg entering into the @entity181 competition , and hopes to enter more in the future though her heart stopped many times , mrs @entity5 does not shy away from activities which increase her pulse			1
she now channels her energy into fitness competitions , which have helped her focus throughout her recovery			1
contrary to popular belief , a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack			1
a cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system			1
it is caused by an abnormal rhythm , or arrhythmia			0
anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning			1
symptoms include unresponsiveness , loss of consciousness , lack of pulse and stopping breathing			0
in contrast , a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart 's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked			2
this causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert			0
she has even entered her first competition - the @entity181 competition , which celebrates female athletic ability and physique			1
@entity5 said : ' the heart attacks were the worst and best experience i 've had			1
i was so scared but now i have survived it , i have a whole new perspective on life			0
' everything was almost taken away from me , but now i am much braver than i was before and i have decided to fight back and enjoy myself			0
' training for the @entity181 competition really helped me recover from my ordeal			2
' it gave me something to aim towards and a reason to get fit and healthy again			0
' i worked out with a personal trainer and i wanted to achieve a strong and supple body			0
' after losing 11kg for the competition , she hopes to enter more in the future			0
she said : ' i 've got the bug now , it is so addictive			0
the doctors could n't believe how well i recovered and i am now determined to push myself			0
' i want to do more fitness competitions and keep enjoying my life to the full			1
