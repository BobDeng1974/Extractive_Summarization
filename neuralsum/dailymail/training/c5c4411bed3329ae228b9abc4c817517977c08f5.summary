by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 no sooner had @entity2 boxed his brilliant way into pole position to fight @entity5 than the clamour for a re-match between the @entity9 man and @entity10 rose up to threaten that prospect			1
@entity2 staked his claim to the key to the @entity5 treasure chest with the dazzling welterweight debut in which he crushed @entity16			1
before the watching world had time to savour the moment , @entity10 followed him into the same ring on the @entity20 and engaged @entity5 in a brawl so thrilling that not even the world ’s no 1 boxer can wait for second helpings			1
september is the proposed date for that spiteful reunion and that is a problem for @entity2			2
the fasting to which @entity45 ’s most celebrated muslim must submit during @entity46 concludes at the end of july			0
as he reiterated here : ‘ that does n’t give me time to train properly for a fight of the @entity5 magnitude			2
’ before this star - spangled fight night at the @entity56 preliminary talks were under way in an effort to persuade @entity5 to put back his next fight from his traditional september date , until november			1
but commercial considerations come first for the man who is banking $ 32 million and rising for his saturday night ’s work and a re-match with @entity10 is now big box office			0
‘ if this is the fight the fans want then let ’s do it in september , ’ he said			0
going the distance : @entity2 won by a unanimous decision as he hoped to set up a bout with @entity5 although the @entity77 crowd jammed into the arena failed to recognise the heart and the talent with which he had brought him through a serious test and booed the majority decision in his favour , those jeers turned to cheers when he offered @entity10 another shot			1
@entity2 ’s best chance appears to be coming back to @entity5 ’s home town next may , although he and his advisors will continue to pursue negotiations as @entity93 tv executives compute the pay - per - view returns and whether @entity10 can help improve those numbers in a return bout			1
in terms of how much pressure he can apply with his fists , @entity2 could hardly have done more as he stepped up to the 147 lbs division for the first time in his career			0
@entity103 , who once gave @entity104 all the trouble he could handle , was resurgent and aiming for a million - making fight of his own with @entity5			1
make a date : @entity5 wants to schedule the fight for september , which falls over @entity46 and would effect @entity2 's training yet even though he is the naturally larger welterweight he was knocked down three times by @entity2 on his way to overwhelming points defeat			1
after the first decking , from a wonderfully short but precise right in the fourth , @entity103 resorted to the desperate measure of fighting with his hands down in hope of luring @entity2 and his allegedly suspect chin onto a sucker punch			0
@entity2 had spent a year out of the ring waiting for @entity5 before he was shunted onto saturday ’s under - card but he spent the time learning to defend himself			1
@entity125 , his latest trainer , also impressed upon @entity2 the advisability of balancing his speed and skill with an element of self - protection while waiting patiently for the openings for his lightning attacks to present themselves			0
below the belt : @entity103 is warned by the referee after delivering a low blow that left @entity2 on the canvas it worked perfectly against another former world champion			0
@entity2 won round after round and @entity103 became so frustrated that he stooped to throwing deliberate low blows			2
to an extent that dubious tactic worked in the eighth , even though he was docked a point by referee @entity146			0
so incensed was @entity2 that he was similarly punished for a foul of his own - and so winded that @entity103 won his only round			2
but two rounds later @entity2 put him down twice more and the @entity151 of @entity153 antecedents was then held up by the ropes and saved by the bell			0
then , knowing the fight was lost , @entity103 hit disgracefully low in the 12th			0
astonishingly the referee did not deduct a point for that grievous offence and even tried to hurry @entity2 back into action			0
@entity161 : often mocked pop star @entity162 was at the @entity56 to cheer on his friend @entity5 @entity2 had to buy himself adequate recovery time by dropping to one knee			1
when he rose , he punished @entity103 through to the final bell			0
@entity2 has always maintained that his speed can over-run anyone , @entity5 included , and many previous non-believers are likely to have been converted by the job he did on @entity103			1
still , on the question of fighting @entity2 , @entity5 kept his counsel , as usual			1
he also kept the unbeaten record he cherishes so much and is 46 - 0 after unifying @entity10 ’s @entity175 world welterweight title with his @entity177 belt			2
@entity5 did that despite @entity10 hitting him 221 times , the most he has endured since computer punch statistics were introduced			1
a shuddering majority of those came during @entity10 ’s cavalry charge through the opening rounds …			2
. from that fabled , knock - out right hand			0
with @entity10 turning it into a street fight , @entity5 was cut beside the right eye by a head butt in the fourth			1
he praised his corner for a repair job which left him untroubled by any blood flow thereafter			0
@entity10 , having won the first , took the fifth also and was level at that point			2
let 's do it again ! @entity5 celebrates after his close fought victory that may spawn a rematch with @entity10 thereafter @entity5 ’s consummate defending and clever , clinical , precise counter-punching gave him control of the crucial middle rounds			1
there was no robbery here , although how one judge scored it a draw is a mystery			0
@entity10 was warned for hitting low and @entity5 told him : ‘ if we do this re-match please remember that i want to have more children			2
’ the @entity31 responded by accusing the @entity212 of ‘ not fighting like a man they way i expected , not bringing the fight to me ’ but no boxer is under any obligation to fight the way that would suit his opponent and from this neutral corner there could be no denying that @entity5 ’s courage and cleverness deserved to give him the victory			1
whether he was strictly telling the truth when he claimed he had risked taking more punches ‘ to please the fans ’ is more debatable			0
@entity2 senses that the great man is slowing down a little , at 37 , and now might be a good time to fight him			2
by that reckoning this time next year could be an even better time .			0

@entity2 proved himself worthy of a fight with @entity5 with victory over @entity16
@entity237 boxer was making his debut at welterweight on @entity5 's *undercard* at the @entity56
@entity5 won a majority decision over @entity10 after a tough fight
@entity2 's next fight is unlikely to be until november *due* to @entity46
@entity247 more likely to take place next may
