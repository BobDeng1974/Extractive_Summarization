by @entity0 ' time for action ' : dr @entity2 said the report recommendations must be acted on out - of - hours @entity6 should be installed in every @entity8 department to help deal with the soaring number of patients , a report by experts has recommended			1
they would be given the job of assessing patients upon arrival to decide in what order they should be treated and deal with any less urgent cases			1
since 2004 , family doctors have been allowed to opt out of working evenings and weekends and subcontract the care to private firms , which offer a patchy service			1
and last year a total of 21.7million patients attended casualty , a rise of 50 per cent over the past decade			1
the increase has been partly blamed on the failings of @entity6 ’ out - of - hours services – a problem which has seen patients turning up at @entity8 departments when they do n’t know where else to go			1
now a joint report from the @entity36 – which represents @entity8 doctors – the @entity38 , the @entity39 and the @entity40 has listed a series of recommendations to address the rise in demand			1
the report warns that @entity8 units are becoming steadily more overwhelmed , particularly in winter when there is a surge in very ill patients			1
it calls for @entity8 units to be able to draft in doctors from other wards during very busy periods			1
sir @entity54 , president of the @entity38 , said : ‘ over the past few years , services for ill patients have been stretched by the sheer amount of acute and emergency admissions			2
‘ we have to plan better for the future to protect patient safety			0
if we do not implement them , then we shall simply walk blindfold into another winter crisis			0
’ and dr @entity2 , president of the @entity36 , said : ‘ it would be nothing short of a scandal if these recommendations were not acted on			2
the time for action is now			0
’ stretched : last year a total of 21.7million patients attended casualty , a rise of 50 per cent over the last decade			1
the rise has been partly attributed to patients turning up at @entity8 when they have nowhere else to go the report sets out 13 recommendations to address the challenges facing urgent and emergency care services across the @entity78 and @entity79			1
as well as out - of - hours family doctors , they said there should also be other health and social care workers in emergency departments to bridge the gap between @entity6 , hospitals and social care services in order to support vulnerable patients			1
aggressive sales reps who pester new mothers into buying their products face being banned from maternity wards			0
parenting promotions firm @entity96 pays the @entity97 £ 2.3million a year to get access to maternity wards , where they sell products including high chairs , prams and car seats			0
the sales reps collect women ’s names and addresses and often pass them on to other companies			0
but now the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) will check whether @entity96 staff are invading women ’s privacy during hospital inspections			0
it will inform hospital bosses of any concerns – who could decide to ban the representatives from the premises			0
professor sir @entity119 , @entity109 ’s chief inspector of @entity120 , said : ‘ women who have recently given birth have a right to privacy and their dignity must be respected			0
’ they also said that community care and social care should be available seven days a week to support urgent and emergency care services , which would mean that patients could be safely discharged outside of normal working hours			2
dr @entity131 of the @entity40 said : ‘ emergency departments are being put under increased pressure as staff are faced with a growing number of patients who are either unable to access out - of - hours care or who see the emergency departments as their “ go - to ” for all health complaints			2
’ she added : ‘ what we need to do now , and as today ’s report highlights , is have better access to out - of - hours primary care , provide doctors with appropriate training and access to advice from paediatricians and have more effective and consistent advice and information sharing between healthcare professionals to reduce unnecessary admissions			2
’ but dr @entity155 , chairman of the @entity156 , warned that implementing the recommendations would be expensive			0
he said : ‘ the system needs to be properly funded , fully resourced and adequately staffed			0
‘ it is crucial that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting , and receive the correct advice and care the first time around			0

family doctors are allowed to opt out of working evenings and weekends

partly *due* to patients turning up when they have nowhere else to go
