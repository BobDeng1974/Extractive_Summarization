@entity0 , 8 , was walking to the park with friends when she was attacked by a dog last week an eight - year - old girl has been left eating through a syringe after she was attacked by a springer spaniel that tore a centimetre off her lip and bit through her cheek			1
@entity0 was walking with her friends near her home in @entity13 , @entity14 , on thursday when she bent down to stroke the dog as it made its way out of a park with its owner			1
her friend stroked the animal first before @entity0 did the same but the spaniel , which was known to her , licked her face then sank its teeth into her cheek - puncturing her			1
she ran back home with blood pouring down her face screaming ' i 'm going to die ' as her horrified father , @entity27 , 47 , called for an ambulance			1
@entity0 was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery , where doctors used the inside or her lip to rebuild the part that had been torn off			1
she spent three days being treated before she was allowed back home on sunday , where she is still recovering			2
the attack has left her unable to eat and her mother @entity38 , 34 , has to blend her food and feed it to her through a straw or with a syringe			1
mrs @entity0 , who has two older sons , @entity43 , 14 , and @entity44 , 12 , said : ' i was heartbroken when i saw her			2
' she was petrified but she 's been so brave and we 're really proud of her			0
she 's a huge dog lover and so sweet with animals so it was a big shock to her			0
' the first day after the attack we could n't even mention the word " dog " around her - she was hysterical			2
' but i 've been trying to explain to her that you get good dogs and bad dogs because i do n't want her to be frightened of them but at the same time part of me never wants her to go near one again			0
' the schoolgirl had bent down to stroke the dog when it sunk its teeth into her cheek and tore a centimetre of skin from her lip			1
she was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery to fix the damage the family was struck by tragedy in 2011 when @entity0 's older brother , @entity72 , drowned while swimming in a quarry near their home			1
' since his death i have been campaigning around schools about safety and that 's where i was at when @entity0 was attacked , ' said mrs @entity0			2
@entity0 , who has since returned home to recover , is likely to have a hairline scar as a result of the attack ' she had been out playing with friends and the owner , who she knows and lives on our road , was coming out of the park and she stroked it like she has done several times before			1
' it liked her face and that 's when it bit into her cheek and took about a centimetre off her lip			0
she ran home screaming and my husband shouted for a neighbour to call the ambulance			1
' her brothers were terrified , especially after losing @entity72 so recently , about what would happen to their sister			2
' i rushed to the hospital as soon as i heard and i could n't believe it when i saw her			0
but the doctors are hopeful and we have to share their enthusiasm that she will be okay			0
' @entity0 is recovering at home and was even strong enough to make it to a party on sunday where she met ' @entity114 ' from @entity115			2
' she 's in a lot of pain and on lots of antibiotics but she 's in really good spirits , ' she added			0
it 's likely she will be left with a hairline scar on her face , but her eye is expected to return fully to normal			0
@entity125 confirmed that a warrant under the dangerous dogs act was executed and the dog seized			0
it remains in kennels and an investigation is under way , which will involve speaking to the victim any witnesses and the dog 's owner			0
mrs @entity0 , whose own dog - a @entity138 cross - died recently , said : ' the police are carrying out interviews and will need to speak to @entity0 in - depth before anything is done			1
' there were lots of witnesses too so i think they need to speak to them as well			0
we 're not sure what is going to happen to the dog but it should be put down after what it 's done to my daughter			0
