a baby who developed an enormous tumor in the womb - but was operated on and saved before birth - has lived to see his second birthday			1
@entity5 , who turned two in november , developed a growth on his lung while still inside his pregnant mother , april			1
surgeons said the tumor , which was three - and - a - half times larger than his head and was crushing his other organs , would surely have killed him if it had been left			2
survivor : @entity5 , now two , survived a rare lung operation from inside the womb and has celebrated his second birthday premature : @entity5 , pictured shortly after his premature birth , struggled to eat and also had a collapsed lung when he was born and surgery carried out while he was still in the uterus removed his hefty tumor ( left ) from his left lung , which was crushing the rest of his organs april and her husband @entity25 instead approved a rare procedure whereby the growth was cut out of @entity5 while he was still in the womb - a move which gave him a 50/50 chance of survival , according to the @entity32			1
april said : ' at my 20 - week ultrasound they saw that we had a tumor			1
thinking that everything was perrfect then finding out that you have something so rare one in 30,000 and that the chance of survival was 50 per cent - it just crushed us			0
' ' the tumor kept growing and growing and growing - three and a half times the size of his head			2
it was just crushing him - he was going into heart failure , lung failure - and if we did n't do it , there was no chance			2
' the family , from @entity57 , @entity58 , moved to @entity59 so they could access the @entity61 , which had specialist surgeons who could carry out the surgery			0
growing , growing : this scan of @entity5 in the womb shows him next to the huge tumor - the white area - which was around the same size as the rest of him recovering : due to a complication in the surgery @entity5 had to eat through a tube for a year , but now thanks to therapy can take food normally - albeit with a smaller apetite at 25 weeks @entity5 underwent the surgery , during which doctors removed an orange - sized tumor from the baby 's body , which scarcely weighed more than 2lbs			1
however , during the surgery they inadvertently pierced his diaphragm , leaving him with a hernia which caused his chest to rupture and lung to collapse			0
he was born prematurely , seven weeks before his due date , so he could be rushed to intensive care , having hardly met his parents			0
by the time he was discharged , @entity5 needed to eat through a tube which pumped food directly into his stomach			2
together : @entity5 was born to mother april and father @entity25 - who went ahead with the risky surgery eating : @entity5 eventually learned to eat like a normal child - though he has a less fierce appetite and is fed on calorie - rich food although the tube has now been removed , and therapy has taught him to take food through eating , @entity5 does n't have the same appetite as most children			1
to make up for it , his mom feeds him high - calorie food like avocados and peanut butter , and cuts his milk with whipping cream			0
in the long term he is not expected to suffer any lasting ill effects from his difficult birth and early years - though it seems to have given him a cautious frame of mind			0
april said : ' he walks through life making sure he is going to be ok			0

@entity5 , now two , developed a fatal tumor before birth
had surgery while still inside mom april to remove large lung growth
parents have spoken of *trepidation* - and later *joy* - at birth
complication meant he struggled to eat normally - but is now doing better
