by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity4 must not be allowed to delay the release of the @entity7 report into the @entity8 , a former @entity3 attorney general warned today			1
@entity9 called for ‘ urgent clarification ’ on whether mr @entity4 , ex-pm @entity11 or the @entity12 are to blame for the delay in publication			1
the former law officer in mr @entity4 ’s first @entity12 urged @entity16 to make a ‘ firm decision ’ to release the report well ahead of next year ’s general election			1
@entity9 , attorney general in @entity4 's first @entity12 , called for an urgent clarification of why the @entity7 report has not been published			1
mr @entity4 , pictured today , has denied he is to blame for the delay mr @entity11 launched the inquiry by sir @entity24 in june 2009 , soon after becoming prime minister			1
the inquiry last took evidence from a witness three years ago			0
there is mounting speculation that the process of declassifying documents , including mr @entity4 ’s correspondence with president @entity34 before the war , has stalled			2
last week deputy prime minister @entity36 expressed his frustration at the lengthy delays and suggested mr @entity4 is to blame – a claim denied by the former prime minister ’s office			1
today @entity9 , who spent two decades on the @entity3 frontbench , warned there is ‘ now the real danger is that the publication will run into the 2015 election ’			2
the @entity46 , chaired by sir @entity24 , was announced in 2009 and took evidence from the last witness three years ago the @entity50 public may come to view the impact of the @entity8 ' differently ' , @entity4 has claimed			1
in a speech in central @entity54 , the former prime minister defended the use of military intervention and warned of the failure to put boots on the ground in @entity60 and @entity61			0
mr @entity4 said : ' we change the regimes in @entity64 and in @entity8 , put soldiers on the ground in order to help build the country , a process which a majority of people in both countries immediately participated in , through the elections			1
but that proved immensely difficult and bloody			0
' we change the regime in @entity60 through air power , we do n't commit forces on the ground , again the people initially respond well			0
' but now @entity60 is a mess and a mess that is de-stabilising everywhere around it			0
' he went on : ' it does not mean that we have to repeat the enormous commitment of @entity8 and @entity64			2
it may well be that in time people come to view the impact of those engagements differently			2
but there is no need , let alone appetite , to do that			0
' writing in the @entity94 , he urged mr @entity16 to commit to publication as soon as possible			0
‘ who is responsible for the delay ? @entity7 and his colleagues , who must be anxious to publish , ’ @entity9 said			2
‘ two past @entity101 - @entity11 and @entity4 ? a cabinet office fighting to maintain a precedent that cabinet minutes and discussions between the two previous prime ministers should be permanently kept private ? ‘ @entity107 deserves a clear statement from mr @entity16 as to the reasons for the delays			1
’ @entity12 officials insist that the declassification of the documents will be completed ‘ soon ’			2
but only after that will inquiry chairman sir @entity114 begin the so - called ‘ @entity118 ’ process of warning figures like mr @entity4 , @entity11 and former foreign secretary @entity117 that they face criticism over the decision to go to war			1
@entity9 added : ‘ what urgently needs clarification now is where the main hold - up is			0
‘ @entity126 by either of the two ex-pms ? masterly inactivity by the present prime minister and his @entity12 ? ' opposition by the @entity12 , who must have advised @entity11 in his statement to @entity107 ? or the stringing out of the process of @entity135 ? ’ a report last week suggested that sir @entity114 ’s review may not be produced until next year , potentially making @entity8 an issue in the 2015 general election campaign – something that concerns @entity3 leader @entity141 , who has sought to distance his party from the @entity4 years			1
mr @entity4 has denied knowledge of the reason for the delays , telling a journalist : ‘ i do n’t know anything more than you do			0
’ @entity9 served as attorney general from 1997 to 1999			0
he had previously served on the @entity3 frontbench under @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			0
he was the @entity154 in the @entity12 under @entity155 and @entity156 .			0

@entity9 slams *unacceptable* delay to report , five years after it launched
asks if ' prevarication ' by @entity4 and @entity11 is to blame
takes a *swipe* at @entity12 for slow progress on releasing documents
@entity4 uses speech to claim people may come to view @entity8 ' differently '
