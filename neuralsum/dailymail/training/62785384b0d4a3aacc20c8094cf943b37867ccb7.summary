by @entity0 for @entity1 an audio recording has emerged of the moment the driver of the derailed train which caused the @entity6 train disaster was told it was his vehicle at fault			1
the recorded phone conversations between train driver @entity9 and a dispatcher referred to only as @entity11 show how the driver had no idea it was his train which has rolled off the tracks and exploded in the @entity17 town			1
when the news is broken to him you can hear @entity9 shout : ' she was f * * * ing secure			1
f * * * ! ' before adding : ' oh , @entity23 …			2
how in the f * * * did that thing f * * * ing roll down , @entity11 ? ' scroll down for audio smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude oil after derailing in downtown @entity6 , @entity17 the train , which was carrying 72 carloads of volatile oil from @entity34 , had been parked on a railway line for the night when it derailed , hurtled down an incline and slammed into downtown @entity6 on july 6 last year			1
several train cars exploded and 40 buildings were levelled			1
parts of the town were evacuated in the early hours of the morning as fireballs shot high into the sky , flames spread to nearby homes and thick acrid smoke filled the air			1
the audio recording , obtained by @entity49 , also shows how it was @entity9 who initially alerted railway company @entity52 , @entity53 & @entity55 @entity54 to the disaster , before he realised his involvement			1
he told the dispatcher : ' everything is on fire - from the church all the way down to the @entity63 , from the river all the way to the railway tracks			1
from what i can see , @entity11 , the box cars have all burnt in the yard - the ties , everything			1
whatever is in the yard , rolling stock , is now gone - completely			1
' searchers dig through the rubble for victims of the inferno in the explosions , which killed 47 people last july the accident resulted in 47 of the town 's residents being burnt to death , and lawsuits have been brought against the now bankrupt company			1
the weak safety culture at @entity52 , @entity53 & @entity54 and poor government oversight were among the many factors that led to the oil train explosion , @entity87 's @entity86 said in a new report released on tuesday			1
tsb chair @entity93 said 18 factors played a role , including a rail company that cut corners and a @entity87 regulator that did n't do proper safety audits			1
' we now know why the situation developed over time , ' @entity93 told a news conference in @entity6			0
' a weak safety culture at @entity104 , poor training of employees , tank cars that did n't offer enough protection			1
' a worker walks near the railway track on the site of the train wreck on july 16 last year driver @entity9 had no idea it was his train which had derailed when he called the dispatcher that night the @entity86 , which is responsible for investigating rail , air and marine accidents , blamed another government agency , @entity119 , for failing in its oversight duties			1
' and then @entity119 did n't audit railways often enough and thoroughly enough to know how those companies were really managing , or not managing , risk , ' @entity93 said			2
tsb chief operating officer @entity124 called @entity52 , @entity53 & @entity55 's operations ' dubious ' and said the railway chose to limit the speed on certain routes instead of improving its equipment			1
' people only did the bare minimum to get the job done rather than always following the rules , ' @entity124 said			0
in may , the @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity135 and three of its employees , including @entity9 , were charged by @entity17 prosecutors with 47 counts of criminal negligence causing death			1
class - action lawsuits are pending			2
the crash , the worst railway accident in @entity87 in nearly 150 years , prompted intense public pressure to make oil trains safer			0
@entity87 's transport minister said in april that the type of tankers involved in the disaster must be retired or retrofitted within three years because they are prone to rupturing			2
