by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 they call it ' the place where stars are born ' and a glance at the cast of notable graduates confirms that is no idle boast			0
the @entity12 is maybe unique , given it is not affiliated to @entity13 or @entity14 , entry is by invitation only and games are 80 minutes long			1
but its propensity for being a breeding ground for world - class players , like @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 is beyond dispute			1
it is a competition that was also once part of @entity27 ’s fabric			2
they were victorious four times between 1990 and 1994 — @entity31 ’s @entity30 captained one successful squad , while @entity33 and @entity34 also played — and on thursday night , after a nine - year absence , a team of @entity36 will set out to prove they can be the names of tomorrow			1
challenge : @entity40 and his @entity42 colleagues will take part in the prestigious @entity12 looking ahead : @entity44 wants his players to develop into stars of the @entity47 nice one : @entity40 is congratulated after scoring the first goal in @entity27 's 3 - 1 win against @entity50 in some respects , it is fitting @entity27 ’s opponents are @entity54 as it will be in the @entity55 , in 2022 , that many of the youngsters in @entity44 ’s 20 - man squad will be at their peak when the ambition , mapped out by @entity61 chairman @entity60 , is to conquer the world			1
that , of course , is a dream but the reality of the next two weeks is that this is a crucial part of their development , one that will provide a number of different tests			0
after @entity54 , @entity27 face holders @entity71 , @entity73 and last year ’s finalists @entity74			2
put simply , @entity27 could do everything that @entity44 asks of them but it still might not be enough to get out of @entity78 ‘ the chairman has gone on record saying he wants us to be a force at the @entity47 in 2022 , ’ said @entity44			1
‘ we will be looking at the lads here to form the nucleus of that @entity87 players will get to experience all the things that come with playing tournament football against teams from all over the world			0
‘ of course , we want to go and win but , if we do n’t , the learning side of things is invaluable			0
’ @entity44 stresses that point and it is little wonder			2
@entity27 ’s under - 21s have sauntered through their @entity99 qualifying group , winning seven of their eight games with little fuss , but each one has been the same : @entity27 attack , opponents sit deep and hope to hold out for as long as possible			1
talent : @entity107 ( left ) , who is close to joining @entity108 , gets away from @entity50 ' @entity109 convincing : @entity27 eased to a comfortable 3 - 1 in a @entity111 qualifier against @entity50 on monday many will expect @entity54 to do the same but a glance at their squad suggests @entity27 will be in for a shock if they are complacent			1
@entity117 , for instance , is on @entity119 ’s books ; @entity120 is with @entity121 , @entity122 plays for @entity123 , while four @entity54 are at @entity124			0
‘ it will be really interesting to play them , ’ said @entity44			2
‘ they are quite free in how they play but if we take liberties we will get punished			0
@entity54 have investment and they are building a side for 2022			0
the journey starts now .			0

@entity27 's under - 21 side will compete in the @entity12 in @entity138
@entity44 hopes his squad will go on to compete at the @entity47
