@entity0 was given a raft of advice on how to soften the then first lady 's stern schoolmarm images , according to documents buried in a 4,000 page dump of files released friday by the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the previously secret paperwork shows mrs @entity0 's press secretary , @entity12 , urging her in august 1995 to consider an appearance on the sitcom @entity15 , a wedding anniversary photo spread for @entity17 and a sit - down interview – with philandering husband @entity19 – across from @entity21			1
' this might be a nice time peg to have the president and @entity0 do a special joint interview with @entity21 , ' @entity12 believed			2
' if we did an interview around the anniversary time peg , it would not appear to be political			0
' those were the days : @entity0 's advisers wanted her to spearhead a love-fest media tour including special attention to the anniversary of her marriage to her philandering husband @entity0 's press secretary told her in 1995 -- the era of @entity39 and dial - up @entity40 -- to prepare to reach the public ' through @entity42 ' @entity12 , mrs. @entity0 's press secretary , floated a series of ideas designed to get positive press surrounding her wedding anniversary -- making it seem less political also on the plan was an interview with a women 's magazine like @entity51			1
' @entity0 should own the women 's media , ' @entity12 wrote			2
and she urged the future senator and secretary of state to give @entity17 an exclusive photo collection from throughout the @entity58 ' marriage , including pictures snapped at ' a big party ' held in honor of the anniversary			1
' i know this may sound like a wild idea , but i think it is an interesting one to discuss , ' @entity12 wrote of the prospect of lining up the president 's wife opposite comedian @entity70 on @entity72 's then - hit show home improvement			0
' the outreach would be enormous and it would present @entity0 in a very likeable light i believe			2
although i have some concerns that it diminishes the role of first lady by going on a tv sitcom , it is probably worth weighing it against what we believe we might be able to gain by such an appearance politically and image-wise			0
' @entity12 's promotion of early online communications vehicles stands out , too			0
' @entity0 could speak to young women through @entity42 , ' she wrote , dropping the word ' the			2
' ' i think @entity0 would have fun with this , and i believe it would not be too difficult to organize			2
' the sudden publication of a portion of 33,000 pages of material came after reporters inquired why they were n't released in january 2013 , at the end of a 12 - year blackout period designed to protect outgoing presidents during their transition to private life			1
but the @entity103 @entity102 does n't appear interested in protecting @entity0 's legacy , or the electoral viability of @entity0 , choosing not to block the release of a single page			1
awkward : @entity0 adviser @entity108 wrote in 1999 that she had to be prepared to answer reporters ' questions about whether she had ever used drugs then - first lady @entity0 is inextricably connected to her husband @entity19 's presidency , taking heat for her involvement in some of the scandals that put asterisks on his political achievements @entity0 's press secretary wanted her to appear on a sitcom opposite comedian @entity70 @entity122 , a right - leaning watchdog group that has demanded documents such as these through @entity126 lawsuits for years , claimed victory on friday			1
' these documents are a long - time coming , ' said the organization 's president , @entity129			0
' it took critical news stories and @entity122 lawsuits ( and the threat of @entity122 lawsuits ) to extract this latest batch of documents after an inexcusable delay			0
the @entity0 administration was rife with secrecy and corruption , so any new bits of information may be important			0
we ’ve been battling for some of this material for nearly a decade			0
' mrs. @entity0 , who is already the @entity147 ' 2016 presidential front - runner , figures prominently in much of the material			1
she spearheaded an ill - fated effort in 1993 and 1994 to reorganize the nation 's health care system , an unusually policy - heavy role for the wife of a @entity155 president			1
and as she prepared in 1999 to run for @entity156 in @entity157 , adviser @entity108 wrote in a memo that she needed to be humorous and relaxed while answering questions at public events			1
look for opportunities for humor , ' she wrote			0
' it 's important that people see more sides of you , and they often see you only in very stern situations			0
' @entity108 also cautioned @entity0 – using quote marks – to " be careful to ' be real ' "			1
' it 's all in there : @entity172 , a @entity173 speechwriter , was a serious doodler , proving that boring strategy meetings can even happen in the @entity176 the @entity8 put out boxes of previously unseen materials on friday , but more reporters found the documents online as she gears up for what nearly everyone in @entity185 expects will be a brutal 2016 election , her involvement in ' @entity183 ' is making the rounds once again			0
@entity0 's scandal - plagued time in the @entity102 will likely make repeated appearance in 2016 campaign ads and presidential debates			1
she was embroiled in a series of controversies while living at @entity102 , including a scandal involving the hiring of @entity198 , a former nightclub bouncer and ' advance ' man for the 1992 @entity202 campaign as director of the @entity204			0
that office , a @entity102 panel learned in 1996 , failed to perform background checks on most @entity102 workers , and improperly obtained @entity210 files covering many appointees and employees of the @entity213 and @entity214 administrations			0
@entity0 was also the driving force behind the first national scandal attached to her husband 's presidency , the so - called ' travelgate ' fiasco			2
in 1996 a memo surfaced publicly that identified her as the main instigator in a plan to dismiss the entire staff of the @entity226 – civil servants who served both @entity147 and @entity229 administrations – and replace them with friends of the @entity58			2
while mrs. @entity0 manicured her image as a supportive wife during the 1990s , her direct involvement in a series of scandals -- and her hands - on management of the ill - fated " @entity183 " program -- painted a picture of a far more ambitious woman @entity241 , the office 's director at the time , had served there since 1961			2
he was later acquitted of charges that he embezzled from travel funds , successfully arguing that he had set aside money in her personal for gratuities and other off - books expenses required when the president travels			0
an @entity103 administration official has told @entity252 that the @entity102 ' cleared a significant number of @entity255 documents ... roughly 25,000 pages , ' referring to the transparency exceptions outlined in sections @entity258 and @entity260 of the @entity261			1
' there have been no executive privilege assertions on @entity0 materials to date , ' said the aide			0
the @entity261 spells out the rules covering memos and other communications produced inside the @entity269 , setting a 12 - year period after which those records are subject to the same rules as other government papers under the @entity126			2
but @entity274 created an exception and decided the the @entity102 could cite executive privilege to block any document from public view after the 12 years have expired			2
@entity19 and @entity0 in their shaggier hippie days -- did she use drugs ? adviser many @entity108 was worried it might come up when she ran for the @entity156 in @entity157 the fact that the administration has chosen to leave everything in plain view could spell trouble for @entity0 , who fought an often brutal 2008 presidential primary campaign against @entity103 before accepting the secretary of state role as a consolation prize in 2009			1
clinton - bashers on both her right and left flanks will look to friday 's release for ammunition to use in both the 2016 primary season and the general election – if she should choose to run , and if she manages to maintain her heir - apparent status in the @entity147			1
and the new records could drive down public perceptions of her in the all - important ' integrity ' category			0
a @entity306 survey of historians this year found that although she ranked sixth among former first ladies overall , but a dismal 21st out of 39 for honesty and integrity			0
' @entity313 was never the @entity58 ' long suit , ' @entity312 director @entity311 told @entity315 last week			0
yet some @entity229 , including moderate senator @entity316 , see @entity0 's ascendency to the @entity102 as inevitable if she chooses to grab the brass ring			1
' as much as i hate to admit it ... right now , if the election were tomorrow , @entity0 would most likely be the president of the @entity155 , ' @entity316 told @entity323 's @entity322 last week			1
yesterday during a breakfast event in @entity185 , @entity326 sen. @entity325 , a much - talked - about @entity229 presidential hopeful aligned with tea party conservatives , said mrs. @entity0 presided over an @entity103 administration foreign policy that has been an absolute debacle … alienating allies and cozying up to enemies			1
' she has been ' consistently wrong on domestic policy and foreign policy , ' @entity325 said			0
the @entity8 in @entity10 released more than 4,000 pages of documents from the 1993 - 2001 @entity337 , including a series of bombshell revelations			1

@entity103 @entity102 did n't object to document releases , likely because the pages swing from boring to silly
nearly 33,000 pages of material were expected to be released a year *ago*
@entity0 , also a former @entity155 senator from @entity157 , is the @entity147 ' *presumptive* *nominee* – if she chooses to jump into the race
the 4,000 - plus pages released friday include inside looks at the @entity355 while @entity0 ran the @entity356 of the @entity102
advisers were concerned in 1999 that she would be asked about drug use as she geared up for a @entity156 run
her press secretary pitched a photo spread in @entity17 showing the history of her marriage to @entity19
