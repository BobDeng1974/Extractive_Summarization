@entity13 was frequented by @entity8 in the 1820s after his close personal friend , the @entity66 , commissioned him for another painting , @entity67			1
but he later created the more dramatic painting from the meadow with an ominous sky that many art experts believe reflected the turbulent state of his life at the time			2

@entity141 from @entity47 , who are selling the property , said the house has a broad appeal , but the new owner will need deep pockets			0
he said houses in the close are so popular because you get the best of town and country living			0
mr @entity141 added : ' it is quite rare to get a house like this on the market			2
there are probably about half a dozen houses of this value in the close			0
' some are still leasehold but a lot of the bigger ones now tend to be freehold			0
' they all tend to front onto the river , which is nice , and a lot of them are very architecturally beautiful , which makes them very popular			0
' but more than anything , what you 're really buying is a slice of town and country			0
' you 've got the benefits of being within the enclave of the beautiful cathedral close but you 're only a moment 's walking distance into the city where you have access to all the amenities			0
' and if you look the other way you 've got beautiful gardens , the river and the water meadows , that 's one of the reasons they are often very sought - after			2
