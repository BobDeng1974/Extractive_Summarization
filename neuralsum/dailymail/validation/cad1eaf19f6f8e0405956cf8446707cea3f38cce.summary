do you love rice but are worried about your weight ? the good news is scientists have now discovered a way to reduce the calorie content by 60 per cent - simply by the way it is cooked			1
cooking the rice with coconut oil , and then cooling it for 12 hours in the fridge , more than halved the number of calories in the rice when it was eaten			2
however , doctors have previously warned that eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning , and so advise making sure the rice is steaming hot all the way through before eating it			1
they also advise leaving the rice in the fridge no more than a day before reheating			2
their recommended method of preparing the rice increases the amount of resistant starch inside it , which is indigestible to the human body			1
therefore this resistant starch is not absorbed and turned into energy or fat , and has no calories			1
the scientists found a two - step process that was able to increase the amount of resistant starch in rice by 10 times			1
first , they added a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water , adding half a cup ( 105g ) of rice , and then either simmering it for 40 minutes , or boiling it for 20 to 25 minutes			0
then , they put the rice in the fridge for 12 hours to cool			0
lead researcher @entity58 , of @entity59 , @entity31 , said if the best variety of rice is prepared using this method , ' it might reduce the calories by about 50 - 60 per cent			1
' he said the team wanted to find food - based solutions to the problem of obesity in developing countries , where rice is often a staple food			2
' we discovered that increasing rice resistant starch ( @entity75 ) concentrations was a novel way to approach the problem , ' he said			1
the coconut oil enters the starch granules in the rice during its cooking , changing its architecture so it can no longer be digested , experts explained a cup , or 210g of rice , contains around 240 calories			1
mr @entity58 explained that starch can be digestible or indigestible			2
@entity90 is made of both of these types of starch			0
unlike digestible types of starch , @entity75 is not broken down in the small intestine , where carbohydrates are normally metabolized into glucose and other simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream			2
so , the researchers reasoned that if they could transform digestible starch into @entity75 , then that could lower the number of calories of the rice			1
this is because the coconut oil enters the starch granules during cooking , changing its architecture so that it becomes resistant to the action of digestive enzymes , mr @entity58 explained			2
this means that fewer calories ultimately get absorbed into the body			0
the cooling for 12 hours is essential , but reheating the rice for consumption does not affect the @entity75 levels , he said			1
he added that the next step will be to complete studies with humans to learn which varieties of rice might be best suited to the calorie - reduction process			0
the team also will also experiment to see if other oils besides coconut have this effect			0
the research was presented at the 249th @entity133 of the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) , the world 's largest scientific society			0
doctors warn reheated rice can cause food poisoning doctors warn that reheated rice can cause food poisoning			1
however , it 's not the reheating that causes the problem but the way the rice has been stored before it was reheated			0
uncooked rice can contain spores of @entity147 , a bacterium that can cause food poisoning			1
when the rice is cooked , the spores can survive			0
if the rice is left standing at room temperature , the spores can grow into bacteria			0
these bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins that cause vomiting or diarrhoea			0
the longer cooked rice is left at room temperature , the more likely it is that the bacteria or toxins could make the rice unsafe to eat			0
how to serve rice safely : ideally , serve rice as soon as it has been cooked if that is n't possible , cool the rice as quickly as possible ( ideally within one hour ) keep rice in the fridge for no more than one day until reheating when you reheat any rice , always check that the dish is steaming hot all the way through do not reheat rice more than once source : @entity175			0

scientists say cooking the rice this way can cut the calories by up to 60 *%*
the method increases the amount of resistant starch ( @entity75 ) in the rice
@entity75 is indigestible to the human body and so is not turned into sugar or fat
however , doctors have warned reheating rice can cause food poisoning
