it was half past midnight on saturday night when @entity1 made his way to the @entity4 team bus and he admitted : ' normally i would have watched @entity6 and gone to bed by now			1
' that apart , the culture shock was minimal for @entity1 on his managerial debut in @entity11 on what seemed like a very @entity13 night in north - eastern @entity14			1
there was foul weather , feisty challenges , a touchline row that ended in a red card , and even a @entity21 flag flying among the pocket of travelling supporters , to make the new coach feel at home			2
@entity1 said he was pleased with his team 's first half display and said the signs were encouraging that his players can take on board his demands for greater intensity			1
@entity1 saw @entity4 pick up a point in a goalless draw against @entity35 he said : ' some people might think you can come here and you are only going to find tiki - taka style but there is intensity to the @entity43 game too			1
you see that with @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
' i have got some incredibly talented footballers here and the playing style is good but they also want to play with intensity and pressing and they also do n't have a problem with hitting a longer pass when it 's right to do so			0
' intensity does n't mean that you just run around a lot , your intensity can come from the way you pass the ball or if you have one player who can beat someone one on one			0
it depends on what you have and i need to find out how we will express our intensity as i get to know my players			2
' @entity1 enjoyed a very @entity13 start to has career in @entity14 that will become increasingly easier as @entity1 spends more time with them on the training ground			1
he admitted after his first game : ' it is not easy at the start because the players probably are n't even understand how i 'm shouting their name at the moment in my broad @entity83 accent			1
' i 've given myself a big challenge			0
i could have taken other jobs in the @entity86 but i wanted to show that i could come out here and do well			0
' @entity1 was also looking to the future when he said he hoped to turn several members of his new squad into @entity14 internationals emulating the success he had with individual players as @entity95 coach			1
@entity1 says there are some very talented footballers at @entity4 at @entity98 he helped players such as @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 to play for their countries and after drawing his first game in charge on saturday he said : ' i would like to think that my reputation for making players better and in some cases turning them into internationals is pretty good			1
' i have got some good young players here and the academy here is really good			2
[ @entity114 ] @entity113 is a good young player and @entity115 is another			0
my challenge is to turn them into international players in the coming 18 months			2
i have done it with one or two others so hopefully i can do it with them as well			0
' @entity4 's @entity122 competes for the ball with @entity124 of @entity35 during the goalless draw his debut might not have given @entity4 their first away win of the season but it was memorable from the moment the team plane touched down … and then took off again at @entity132 's airport			1
' the weather was so bad the plane could n't land – it came down and went back up again twice , ' said @entity1			2
' we ended up having to land at a different airport			0
' @entity1 watches on as @entity137 comes off during the draw with @entity35 the rain kept up throughout a hard - fought goaless draw marred in the first half by the sending off of @entity35 assistant coach @entity142 who reacted furiously as @entity143 gestured for him to calm down as he made his way down the tunnel			1
' i joked to my assistant when the referee made the sending off that i could see myself getting in trouble on my debut			0
there was a @entity13 feel to it with the rain coming down and the way the tackles were flying in during the first half			0

@entity4 drew 0 - 0 with @entity35 in @entity1 ' first game
