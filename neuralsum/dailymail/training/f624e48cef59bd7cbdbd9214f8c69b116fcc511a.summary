a stream of messages have been posted on the social networking site offering humorous suggestions to the prime minister about how he should get back in touch with the general public			1
the @entity18 has often said that he and the government is battling alongside the rest of the country in its efforts to ride out the current economic crisis , but austerity measures have proved unpopular and embarrassing gaffs such as ‘ pastygate ’ have left voters questioning his integrity			2
writing under the hashtag ‘ # davekeepsitreal ’ , users poked fun at mr @entity3 ’s wealth and ‘ toff ’ background			1
' @entity35 ' wrote that @entity10 should ' keep it real ' by ‘ sending a ' friend ' request to @entity39 on @entity40 ! ’ mr @entity39 , who started the hashtag , posted that the prime minister should ‘ eat caviar straight out of the tin ’ and start ‘ hanging out with northern mps … like @entity46			2
’ user @entity47 teased mr @entity3 for his recent claim that he shopped in @entity49 ’s			1
mocking the @entity51 mp he wrote : ‘ i ’m not a snob			1
my butler has shopped at @entity54			0
’ crumbling : @entity3 has come under fire for ' pastygate ' when he claimed to have eaten a pasty from a branch in @entity58 that does n't exist on the same theme @entity59 commented : ‘ his favourite song is the @entity62			1
‘ @entity63 , he ’s my @entity64			2
’ ‘ @entity69 ’ said the prime minister could regain public confidence by ‘ paying for @entity67 on his platinum card			2
’ mr @entity3 has refuted suggestions that he is not in touch with the public and sticks by his famous ‘ we ’re all in this together ’ slogan			1
however , ministers have recently been criticised over the way they dealt with the fuel strike threat and the handling of @entity81 's attempted deportation			0
satirical comments about mr @entity3 from @entity6 users continued to flood into the site throughout the day			1
crumbling : @entity3 has come under fire for ' pastygate ' when he claimed to have eaten a pasty from a branch in @entity58 that does n't exist @entity88 said the leader should keep it real by ‘ visiting the city of @entity92 to see how the other half live in the north			1
’ @entity95 said that @entity96 could be ' down with the kids ' by announcing that his favourite rappers are @entity99 – ' nannies with attitude			0
' @entity102 said the prime minister should refer to ‘ guns as shooters ’ when flogging arms to dodgy regimes			2
’ the comments comes in the wake of @entity3 's announcement yesterday that he wanted to ‘ stay in touch ’ with voters as he brushed aside claims that he was an ‘ arrogant posh boy ’			1
after a turbulent month he vowed to ‘ learn some important lessons ’ but his fightback was marred by an extraordinary attack on him and @entity117 by @entity119 mp @entity118 who branded them ‘ arrogant posh boys ’ who ‘ do n’t know the price of milk ’			1
in a separate blow to the @entity128 , a poll showed mr @entity3 ’s three - point lead a month ago has been replaced by an eight - point lead for @entity131			1
mrs @entity118 told the @entity134 ’s @entity133 show : ‘ there is a very tight narrow clique of a certain group of people and what they do is act as a barrier and prevent @entity3 and @entity117 and others from actually really understanding or knowing what is happening in the rest of the country			1
‘ i think that not only are @entity3 and @entity117 two posh boys who do n’t know the price of milk , but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse , no contrition , and no passion to want to understand the lives of others – and that is their real crime			1
’ mr @entity3 sighed when @entity157 ’ remarks were read to him later			2
‘ look , i do n’t agree with @entity118			1
she ’s got a very strong view about a number of things , he said			0

i do a lot of the family shopping			0

’ but in his most frank assessment of the government ’s recent performance , the prime minister admitted : ‘ there is n’t a day in this job that i do n’t learn some important lessons and you ’ve got to make sure you stay in touch and realise that as you get on with it			2
’ @entity3 will try to avoid close dealings with tax - dodging businessmen in future , he pledged yesterday			2
the prime minister , whose party has been accused of being too close to the rich , said the government was cracking down on individuals and businesses carrying out ‘ aggressive tax avoidance ’			2
when asked if he would try to avoid dealing with tax dodgers , he told the @entity134 : ‘ generally speaking , yes , i think that ’s sensible			0
’ but he refused to comment on sir @entity193 ’s tax affairs – the billionaire retailer who was a government efficiency adviser			0
critics accuse sir @entity193 of avoiding millions of pounds of tax by registering most of his business in the name of his wife @entity202 , who lives in @entity203			0
mr @entity3 said : ‘ he came up with very sensible suggestions for how you could reduce costs in government and therefore reduce people ’s tax liabilities			1
’ he suggested poor communication was to blame for many of the @entity213 ’s recent difficulties – citing the fuel strike , when ministers were accused of helping to trigger panic buying			0
cabinet office minister @entity217 called for voters to fill jerry cans with petrol and keep them in their garages			0
‘ sometimes a presentational mistake can be an important mistake , ’ said mr @entity3			1
‘ on the fuel strike issue ... we have taken very effective action ... but did we communicate perfectly at every stage ? i think most people would say , “ no you did n’t ”			0
’ asked if he would apologise for the government ’s role in causing chaos at the pumps , the prime minister said : ‘ the government took the right action in terms of the resilience of the country but we need to do better in terms of communication			0
’ pressed again on whether he was sorry , he added : ‘ of course			0
look , i ’m responsible in the end for everything the government does , and if we do n’t get it right i ’m very clear about that			0
’ in a separate interview , part of a round attempting to draw a line under recent difficulties before local elections next month , mr @entity3 conceded his government must ‘ raise our game ’			1
' raise the game ' : mr @entity3 conceded yesterday that the government must do better as a poll put @entity131 support at a nine - year high of 41 per cent ‘ everything we are doing is about helping people who work hard and do the right thing and making this country more pro-enterprise , more pro-get - up - and - go , more pro-work , more pro-effort			1
the prime minister yesterday defended finding the time to have ‘ date nights ’ with wife @entity268 and watch dvd box sets			0
mr @entity3 said he was ‘ absolutely driven ’ in his job , but insisted it was right to find time for his family			1
as polls show that support for the @entity119 is plummeting , some backbench @entity119 mps have said mr @entity3 is too relaxed for his role			1
one @entity119 backbencher told the @entity278 that mr @entity3 was ‘ putting the school run ahead of the national interest ’			1
but mr @entity3 said that prime ministers who do not take time out from their jobs end up ‘ completely fried and exhausted ’ and make ‘ bad judgements ’			1

you have difficult weeks or difficult months			0
i want us to raise our game and do better , ’ he said			0
the prime minister dismissed claims that he is too relaxed			0
‘ i may look relaxed but i do n’t ever feel particularly relaxed in this job , ’ he said			0
however , a committee of @entity273 will today give voice to criticism of mr @entity3 ’s leadership style in a report blaming a lack of strategic thinking for a series of policy mistakes			2
‘ policy decisions are made for short - term reasons , little reflecting the longer - term interests of the nation , ’ mps on the commons public administration select committee will say			0

‘ it does n’t usually work , and i do n’t think it will work this time either , ’ he said			0
he also defended the right of @entity317 officials to offer potential tax changes to an number of different administrations , following claims the ‘ pasty tax ’ and ‘ granny tax ’ – had been rejected by previous chancellors and ‘ taken off a shelf ’			0
‘ just because one political party does n’t think something is a good idea does n’t mean that a different form of government might decide that they ’ve got different political priorities and might want to go with it , ’ he said.last night ’s @entity327 survey for the @entity328 revealed support for @entity131 has reached its highest level for nine years			1
