by @entity1 reporter published : 19:17 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 03:29 est , 10 december 2013 the lack of border checks on private planes landing in @entity6 may be allowing organised crime bosses to fly in and out of @entity6 with impunity , mps warned last night			0
the chairman of an influential committee in @entity11 warned that the failure of border officials to conduct passport and other checks on small aircraft could be ‘ letting billionaire gangsters off the hook ’			0
@entity20 mp @entity19 made her warning in a damning report about failures at the @entity24 - a @entity26 agency tasked with protecting @entity6 ’s borders			1
warning : @entity19 , @entity20 member of @entity11 and chairwoman of the @entity29			1
a damning report about failures at the @entity24 has been released the @entity29 ’s report into @entity24 found staff shortages meant freight coming in to the country ’s sea and air ports went unchecked - potentially allowing in illicit goods and illegal immigrants			1
it also warned : : : a major it system , the @entity41 , used to stop terrorists and criminals from getting in to @entity6 is ‘ at risk of collapse ’			0
: : staff had been fired , paid off lump sums in redundancy and then re-hired when crisis hit			2
: : nearly forty per cent of passengers are not screened in advance of landing mrs @entity19 said @entity24 was unable to meet and check up to 90,000 private planes and private boats arriving in the @entity6 each year - leaving the @entity6 border ‘ vulnerable ’			1
known as ‘ general aviation ’ this sector has long been a concern as a possible route into @entity6 for drugs , illegal migrants and organised criminals			0
the report found huge gaps in the data the agency receives on people landing private planes or boats in @entity6			1
the report said : ‘ the information the @entity24 receives on incoming private planes and boats is notably poor , and there is concern that those able to access private planes and boats can evade border checks			1
‘ the intelligence alerts to frontline @entity24 staff on potential threats are of limited utility as they are generated from cross-checking data on legacy systems not designed for this purpose			1
’ @entity24 was hived off as a separate agency 18 months ago after it emerged passengers were being waved through without proper checks to keep airport delays to a minimum			2
mrs @entity19 said @entity24 was unable to meet and check up to 90,000 private planes and private boats but the report warned there was ‘ little evidence ’ since then of progress in tackling existing problems			1
mps also criticised the agency for ‘ too readily ’ using national security as an excuse for not providing information to the committee or the @entity104			0
it found the agency had cut staff numbers by 500 between 2010 and last year but then increased front line numbers by 400 when new checks were imposed			1
‘ paying out redundancy and then rehiring staff is bad value for money and demonstrates poor planning ’ , the report said			2
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ @entity116 prioritised passenger checks on arrival at the expense of other duties and weakened the security of our borders			2
‘ the force neglected to examine freight for illicit goods , neglected to check lorries in @entity128 for concealed illegal entrants , and failed to check passengers coming into @entity6 on private planes or boats , potentially letting billionaire gangsters off the hook			2
immigration minister @entity135 said : ‘ @entity24 was split from the @entity136 last year to create a separate command with a clear security and law enforcement ethos			0
‘ it is making significant improvements in its performance - excessive queues at airports are gone and security strengthened			0
this extends to both passengers and goods and is underpinned , for the first time , by a clear @entity150 set by ministers			0
‘ it will take time to transform @entity24 and fix all the problems we inherited but i am confident that we are making the right changes			0
none of the issues raised in this report come as a surprise and they are already being actively addressed			0
