@entity2 bosses knew about the @entity4 tax scandal eight months before the bank 's chairman was appointed as a government minister , it emerged last night			1
the agency received a copy of the list of clients with millions stashed away in @entity12 before @entity13 of @entity14 was brought in to government in january 2011			1
@entity16 said it ' beggared belief ' that @entity2 would not have reported to the chancellor about problems at the bank when it began investigating the individuals concerned for tax evasion			1
questions : @entity13 ( left ) was a @entity24 trade minister and @entity25 ( right ) was then @entity2 's head of tax today , @entity2 will be grilled over its treatment of tax avoiders			1
chief executive @entity30 and top officials @entity31 and @entity33 will meet the commons public accounts committee			0
@entity2 was asked to vet @entity13 before his appointment , but only about his personal tax arrangements			1
that was despite a formal investigation by @entity2 into the @entity4 accounts from at least as early as october 2011			1
but @entity40 insisted ministers knew nothing about the client list when @entity44 made @entity13 a @entity24 peer and then trade minister			1
shadow chancellor @entity47 told the @entity48 the government was ' in an utter state of confusion ' over the issue			1
accusations : @entity47 said it ' beggars belief ' that @entity2 would not have informed the chancellor in 2011 he said : ' something on this scale and of this seriousness , in my experience of many years in the @entity61 , it beggars belief that @entity2 would not have told the chancellor of this systemic problem			1
it 's also staggering that @entity13 could be appointed to government			1
without apparently anybody discussing whether or not that was appropriate , given these ongoing allegations			0
' mr @entity44 has said @entity13 was an ' excellent ' trade minister , and ministers insist there is no evidence he was involved in any tax evasion			1
the billionaire paedophile friend of prince @entity74 was among @entity4 offshore investors named in the leaked account files			2
the data links @entity78 to several private accounts in @entity80 , including one in his own name which held £ 2.3million			0
@entity78 , above right , who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting sex with underage girls , was last month accused of employing teenage ‘ sex slave ’ @entity85 , who claimed he made her sleep with prince @entity74 when she was 17			0
@entity89 has denied the @entity74 had ‘ any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity85 ’ and @entity78 has called her claims ‘ outlandish and offensive ’			0
the disgraced hedge fund manager is one of seven clients of @entity4 ’s private banking arm in @entity80 known to have donated to the charitable foundation run by former @entity100 president @entity99 and his wife @entity101			2
miss @entity85 , now 31 and a mother of three , has said she met mr @entity99 twice but was never ‘ lent out ’ to him			0
she claimed @entity78 told her : ‘ he owes me some favours			0
’ @entity78 gave $ 25,000 ( £ 16,400 ) to the foundation in july 2006 , the year after he was arrested following a complaint he abused a 14 - year - old , the @entity104 reported			0
another @entity80 client , restaurateur @entity108 , transferred $ 1million to the foundation , seemingly in return for mr @entity99 ’s attendance at a charity ball in 2005			0
it is not illegal to hold a @entity12 bank account and there is no evidence any of the donors used accounts to avoid tax			0
the foundation keeps a public database of donors and says all donations are vetted carefully			0
@entity124 told @entity125 there was ' no evidence of any conspiracy '			0
the culture secretary insisted that @entity2 is ' independent of day - to - day government '			2
but the revelation that thousands of ' black ' accounts were used to stash millions and avoid tax has caused outrage			0
bank records were stolen by a whistleblower in 2007 , but did not reach @entity137 until 2010 after a deal between @entity2 and the @entity140 authorities			2
officials say part of the deal was that the taxman could not pass on the details			0
since then only one person has been prosecuted despite £ 135million being recovered			0
the @entity104 reported @entity25 , @entity2 's then head of tax , as saying that the taxman was required to ' provide an indication of reputational risk for appointments of peers in relation to their tax compliance history only '			2
in a letter to @entity157 yesterday , @entity16 frontbencher @entity155 wrote that , if ministers knew about the claims , ' failure to ask probing questions would have to be seen as wilfully negligent			1
as chairman of the bank , mr @entity13 would either have been aware of malpractice or , if not , surely questions would arise as to why not			0
' yesterday @entity40 initially said that neither @entity13 , who stepped down as a minister in 2013 , nor any other member of the government , had ' any knowledge that @entity4 may have been involved in wrongdoing ' until it was reported in newspapers and by the @entity48 in recent days			1
but the comments were at odds with claims by treasury minister @entity175 , who told the @entity176 on monday that information about @entity4 had been ' in the public domain since 2007 '			2
@entity40 later said it had ' no record ' that @entity2 told ministers about apparent @entity4 involvement in ' wrong - doing relating to its @entity12 banking arm '			1
@entity184 , chief executive of the @entity186 watchdog , the @entity183 , told the treasury select committee that @entity2 had not passed on details of the allegations before they appeared in the media			2
@entity2 chief executive mrs @entity30 said the data was given to the tax authority under conditions which stopped it from sharing the information .			1

@entity2 given *dossier* before former @entity4 chief @entity13 brought in
but the tax agency was only asked to vet him for his personal *finances*
@entity205 : ministers knew nothing when he became peer and trade minister
@entity47 accuses government of being in ' utter state of confusion '
