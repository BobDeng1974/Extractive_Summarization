by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 04:06 est , 2 april 2013 he is the judge who thinks burglars are ‘ courageous ’ – an opinion which earned him an official reprimand for damaging public confidence in the courts			2
now @entity7 is at the centre of another controversy , this time for letting a convicted paedophile skip jail because he thought he ‘ would suffer very badly ’ in prison			1
in a move which has outraged campaigners for victims of child abuse , the judge allowed 24 - year - old child - porn addict @entity18 to walk free , despite the fact that he is a repeat offender			1
' strange decision ' : pervert @entity18 ( pictured ) has been spared jail by a controversial judge despite being caught with child porn while already on a suspended prison sentence ' remarkably short - sighted ' : judge @entity7 ( left ) has been criticised for refusing to jail @entity18 because he would ' suffer badly ' in prison @entity18 was caught for the second time with a catalogue of hardcore indecent images of young boys and girls on his mobile phone – a crime which even he admitted he ‘ fully expected ’ to go prison for			1
but judge @entity7 gave him a suspended sentence – the second @entity18 has received – because he feared he would n’t ‘ cope ’ with jail			1
judge @entity7 told @entity18 : ‘ i have read with some concern about you , and this addiction you have had of looking at pornography of little children			1
‘ i think you would suffer very badly in prison and i do n’t think , at the moment , it is necessary to send you there today			2
@entity7 , 67 , a married father - of - three , has been no stranger to controversy in his 20 - year career as a judge			1
three years ago , he allowed a violent thug to walk free from court despite admitting that the public think judges are ' going mad ' for passing soft sentences			1
in another case , he told a man who led police on a ten - mile car chase after trying to kill himself : ' next time you want to commit suicide find somewhere quiet to do it			2
' more recently , he has made contradictory comments about burglary sentencing			0
in may last year , he criticised sentencing guidelines that let first - time burglars escape with a ' slap across the wrist '			2
but weeks later , he allowed a man with almost 80 crimes on his record to walk free for a burglary committed four days after his release from prison , telling the court : ‘ i must be getting soft in my old age			1
’ ‘ i am going to give you another suspended sentence , but you have got to understand it is the very last chance you are ever going to get			2
’ in september last year , judge @entity7 caused public outrage for praising the ‘ courage ’ of serial burglar @entity85 , 26 , and letting him off with a suspended sentence			1
he told him : ‘ it takes a huge amount of courage , as far as i can see , for somebody to burgle somebody ’s house			0
i would n’t have the nerve			0
’ he was criticised for his choice of words , which were branded a ‘ serious error of judgment ’			0
following an investigation , the lord chancellor @entity98 and lord chief justice lord judge upheld complaints about the comments and issued @entity103 with a reprimand for his remarks which had ‘ damaged public confidence in the judicial process ’			0
in the latest case , he was presented with @entity18 , from @entity109 , who had been already let off by a court after being caught with child porn in 2009			1
he was handed an eight - month prison sentence , suspended for two years , which allowed him to walk free as long as he did not offend again during the supervision period			1
he was told to go on a sex offenders ’ treatment programme to cure his ‘ addiction ’ and had to allow police officers access to his computer			0
then last week , @entity120 heard how police visited his home in february last year to check on his internet activity on his computer and mobile phone			0
prosecutor @entity126 told the court that a total of 48 still and moving images of child abuse – some in the worst category – were found on his phone			0
although he was caught for a second time after his first sentence had run its course , police could tell from the image files that some had been downloaded within the two - year time frame of the initial suspended sentence			1
judge @entity7 told him : ‘ you present quite a problem for me because , in theory , you had breached the suspended sentence			2
‘ as most people will know , if people do breach a suspended sentence , then it is almost inevitable they go straight away to prison			0
’ but in a highly unusual move , judge @entity7 then imposed a 12 - month jail sentence , suspended for two years , with probation service supervision			1
the @entity153 of @entity154 in @entity155 last night described the sentence as ‘ strange by any standards ’			0
dr @entity158 , from the charity , said : ‘ this is remarkably short - sighted , in my opinion			1
in prison this kind of offender would be segregated for his protection			0
‘ i imagine he is at home laughing about how he fooled a judge			0
‘ there has to be a strong deterrent enforced on these criminals who cause so much pain to their victims			0
’ yesterday , @entity18 said outside his flat : ‘ obviously i did n’t want to go to prison but i went to court fully expecting to			2
‘ he said i could n’t have coped in prison but this is my definite last chance			0
‘ i have definitely learned my lesson and wo n’t do it again			0

judge @entity179 claimed @entity18 would ' suffer badly ' if sent down
@entity18 already on suspended jail term when caught with more sick images
campaigners *slammed* decision ' strange ' and ' remarkably short - sighted '
judge *provoked* outrage last year when he also let serial burglar walk free
