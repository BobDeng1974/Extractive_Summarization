a year 's worth of changes to vegetation across the world have been plotted during a fascinating animation by @entity5			1
the space agency spent a year collecting satellite images using its @entity9 - orbiting partnership technology and the photos provide a vivid , at - a - glance depiction of the @entity13 's natural landscape			1
they highlight the stark contrast between the plush green lands of @entity17 next to the dry , arid regions of @entity19			0
the images also show how forest fires can physically scar the landscape in places such as @entity24 and how rivers , in dry areas such as @entity26 , can replenish the land and provide a life source for its inhabitants			0
scroll down for animation this @entity13 image was captured by @entity5 satellites and shows worldwide vegetation			1
the data was collected using the @entity37 , or @entity39 technology on board the @entity42 satellite			1
@entity39 can detect changes in the reflection of light which can then be used to produce images that measure vegetation changes over time @entity49 was collected using the @entity37 , or @entity39 technology on board the @entity42 satellite			2
@entity42 , short for @entity9 - orbiting @entity51 , is a partnership between @entity5 and the @entity53 ( @entity53 )			2
@entity39 is able to detect changes in the reflection of light which can then be used to produce images that measure vegetation changes over time			0
the @entity42 vegetation data collected as part of the @entity13 project will be incorporated into the @entity61 , or @entity61 , products and services			1
these services include environmental monitoring , numerical weather prediction models and the @entity67 operated by the @entity68			1
the vegetation index measures and monitors plant growth , vegetation cover and biomass production from satellite information			0
according to @entity5 : ' high values of @entity61 , or @entity61 , represent dense green functioning vegetation and low @entity61 values represent sparse green vegetation or vegetation under stress from limiting conditions , such as drought			2
' the vegetation from @entity13 's @entity84 including @entity17 and @entity19 is pictured left , while the vegetation in the @entity86 is shown in the right - hand image			1
areas around the @entity89 , especially in @entity19 are shown dry and arid although the green strip created by the @entity92 in @entity26 is visible ' @entity61 represents the photosynthetic potential of vegetation.the summation or integration of @entity61 over time represents gross primary production			0
' high index values represent dense , green , functioning vegetation			0
low values represent sparse vegetation or vegetation under stress from conditions , such as drought			0
' @entity5 continued : ' although 75 per cent of the planet is a relatively unchanging ocean of blue , the remaining 25 per cent of @entity13 's surface is a dynamic green			1
' data from the @entity39 sensor aboard the @entity5 / @entity53 @entity42 satellite is able to detect these subtle differences in greenness			2
' the resources highlight our ever - changing planet , using highly detailed vegetation index data from the satellite , developed by scientists at @entity53			2
' the darkest green areas are the lushest in vegetation , while the pale colors are sparse in vegetation cover either due to snow , drought , rock , or urban areas			0
' urbanised areas of northern @entity19 can be seen among the deserts of @entity26 and beyond			0
this image was captured by @entity5 's @entity42 satellite between 9 and 15 july last year			2
it also shows the green region around the @entity92 which provides the main source of water to the region to remove the clouds @entity5 used computer programs to identify the best cloud - free measurement for every spot on the planet			1
those individual measurements were then added together to form a single cloud - free mosaic of the planet			0
the measurements from viirs continue some of the data records collected by several @entity5 satellites , including @entity150 and @entity151			1
@entity150 and @entity151 each make use of an instrument called the @entity154 , or @entity154 , which looks at global vegetation along with other @entity13 features			2
@entity39 collects visible and infrared imagery and radiometric measurements of the land , atmosphere , cryosphere , and oceans			0
a ' river of grass ' extending south of @entity164 shows areas of dense man - made agriculture , urban sprawl and water conservation areas delineated by a series of waterways that crisscross southern @entity172			0
this image was created between 18 and 24 march this year its data is used to measure cloud and aerosol properties , ocean color , sea and land surface temperature , ice motion and temperature , fires , and @entity13 's albedo			1
@entity5 said climatologists can use @entity39 data to improve our understanding of global climate change			1
the @entity42 satellite was renamed in january 2012 to @entity42 after @entity191 , a meteorologist at the @entity192 â€“ @entity193			0
the satellite was launched from @entity195 in @entity196 on 28 october 2011			0
it around 512 miles above the @entity13 .			1

@entity5 collected the data using satellites and infra - red imaging technology that orbits 512 miles above the @entity13
a computer program was used to find *cloudless* areas so the image was *n't* obscured
the data will be used to help with environmental monitoring , predicting global changes in the weather and tracking the *damage* caused by drought
