@entity3 clubs will next week demand @entity0 close a loophole that allows some clubs to qualify for the @entity6 without submitting accounts to comply with financial fair play rules			1
there is widespread concern among clubs that teams such as @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 did not have to submit their accounts to @entity0 last season because they were not involved in @entity3 competition			1
senior figures in the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) believe that gives the clubs an advantage in terms of qualifying for the lucrative tournament in that they are not subject to the same spending constraints			0
@entity15 are one of a number of clubs who did not have to submit their accounts to @entity0 last season the @entity33 are hoping to write off losses as allowable stadium expenditure as they are investigated @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16 all qualified for the @entity6 and it is only this season that they have had to submit their accounts			1
@entity0 announced two weeks ago that they are among seven clubs being investigated for possible @entity9 breaches			2
@entity0 said the clubs had ' disclosed a break - even deficit on the basis of their financial reporting periods ending in 2012 and 2013 '			2
the issue will be brought up when @entity0 holds a meeting with clubs on monday to discuss any changes to the @entity9 rules			2
one @entity3 club executive said : ' it makes no sense that clubs can qualify for the @entity6 without having had to submit their accounts - it can even encourage them to overspend in order to qualify			1
@entity0 are also investigating clubs including @entity58 's ( @entity57 ) @entity17 as well as @entity16 and @entity59 ' we are meeting @entity0 next week and we will push them to close this loophole			1

the meeting is also expected to look at whether large debts carried by clubs such as @entity74 and @entity75 should also be tackled more strongly by @entity9 rules			1
currently , only the interest on those debts is viewed as part of the @entity9 calculation			0
@entity62 chairman @entity81 said in the summer : ' we have zero debt			0
we do n't pay a penny to service any debt			0
for me , that is a sustainable model			0
however , our friends at @entity0 seem to believe otherwise			2
they have their view ; we have ours			0
' @entity90 , @entity0 's general secretary , said on thursday : ' certainly , the question of debt is something that can be put on the table			0
