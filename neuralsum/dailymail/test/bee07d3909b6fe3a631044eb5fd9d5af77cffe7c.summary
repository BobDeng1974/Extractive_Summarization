the country ’s biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year			1
the figures from the @entity9 were seized on by @entity10 and the @entity11 as ‘ shocking ’ evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , the so - called bedroom tax , and stopped benefits			1
but @entity19 benefits chief @entity18 questioned the numbers , which he said were ‘ unverified ’ , and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work			2
the @entity25 claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in @entity28 another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a ‘ political football ’			2
the row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks – said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming , and by critics to show that when free food is handed out , people will always come forward to take it			1
yesterday ’s report from the @entity9 put the number of people who were given three days ’ worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604			1
its @entity51 director @entity50 said : ‘ despite welcome signs of economic recovery , hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men , women and children			0
the latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the @entity51			0
’ the latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks , with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013 - 14 , when there were 913,138 food bank visits			1
@entity18 , pictured , dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the @entity9 's figures are ' unverified ' this figure was almost three times the 2012 - 13 level of 346,992			1
in 2009 - 10 the @entity9 recorded 40,898 food bank visits			1
the claims have been disputed because the @entity9 counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three - day food packages , and not numbers of individuals			1
this means an unknown number make repeat visits , and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million			1
@entity89 carried out by the @entity9 , @entity90 , the @entity91 and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks			1
it found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract			2
a chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise @entity107 over the figures			0
@entity10 ’s work and pensions spokesman @entity109 said : ‘ the shocking rise in the number of people relying on @entity9 food banks since 2010 shows the @entity19 plan is failing			1
‘ @entity107 ’s failure to tackle low pay , the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid			2
’ @entity11 general secretary @entity123 said : ‘ this should make all of us ashamed , particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery			2
it tells us that the government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net			0
‘ vicious sanctions and benefit cuts – even for those who paid in all their working lives – are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident			0
’ @entity90 poverty chief @entity140 said : ‘ it is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the @entity51			1
’ the picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected @entity149 - based @entity148 published earlier this month , which put @entity51 in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger			0
mr @entity18 said the @entity9 ’s figures were ‘ unverified ’			2
he added : ‘ we are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory – whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone			0
‘ the best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work – and we ’ve got a strong record there : two million more people in work since the last election			0
@entity123 , @entity11 general secretary , pictured , described the figure as ' shameful ' ‘ it is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it			0
’ the @entity179 , which is independent of the @entity9 network , urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures			1
the organisation , which distributes food to other charities which provide meals , rather than handing it out to individuals , said : ‘ we think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon – whereas food poverty is not			0
‘ as an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of @entity200 , we adopt a non-political stance			0
to do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support			0
‘ the issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading			0
we congratulate the @entity9 on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle			2
‘ it is high time the @entity179 model of food bank – which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty – is encouraged and replicated elsewhere			0

the @entity9 counted the number of people visiting its 445 branches
the charity hands out three - day food parcels to people requiring help
critics claim that people will come forward if free food is on offer
@entity239 said getting people working was better than providing hand - outs
