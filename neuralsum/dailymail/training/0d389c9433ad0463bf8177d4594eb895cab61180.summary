by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 07:17 est , 7 december 2012 25 per cent of mothers in @entity2 had a @entity4 - a slight increase from the previous year older mothers are behind the number of caesarean sections rising yet again			1
the latest maternity figures show that 25 per cent of mothers in @entity2 had a caesarean - a slight increase from the previous year , according to data from the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			2
older mothers were more inclined to have an elective c section - with 18 per cent over the age of 35 opting not to give birth naturally			1
one in 10 mothers aged 25 to 34 had the elective surgery with just five per cent of those under 25 giving birth by caesarean , according to the hospital data from 2011 and 2012			1
the @entity21 has raised concerns about the figures			2
@entity24 , the @entity21 's director for midwifery , said : ' that means that one in four women giving birth is having a caesarean , which is a major surgical procedure			1
' there has also been a rise in the number of elective caesareans while the number of emergency caesareans has remained stable			0
questions must be asked as to what the driver is behind this increase in elective surgery			0
' an increase in caesarean rates and instrumental deliveries often reflects a decrease in involvement with midwives , and this concerns me			0
' the data also shows that more older women and fewer teenagers are having babies			0
the rate of teenage mothers giving birth in @entity2 hospitals has fallen by a fifth in five years			1
in 2011/12 , 33,600 mothers aged 13 to 19 gave birth in @entity61 hospitals - a 22 per cent fall on the number recorded in 2006/07			2
older mothers were more inclined to have an elective c section - with 18 per cent over the age of 35 opting not to give birth naturally in the same time frame , the number of mothers aged 40 to 49 increased by 16 per cent , from 22,200 to 25,600			1
ms @entity24 added : ' this data also shows that the age profile of pregnant women is getting older			0
" the baby boom , combined with the increasing age of mothers , means greater demands on maternity services , as pregnancies for older women can give rise to increased complications and a need for medical interventions , which demands more of midwives and others in the maternity team			2
' as we are in the midst of a baby boom , these factors together with the increasing social complexity of care needs for all mothers have a dramatic effect on the workload heaped on already overstretched midwives			0
' @entity96 has the most older mothers - but the youngest number of teenage pregnancies @entity11 chief executive @entity99 added : ' while the number of hospital deliveries in @entity2 has broadly risen - albeit relatively slowly - in recent years , almost 10,000 fewer hospital deliveries last year were to teen mums compared to five years previously			1
' this drop in hospital teen deliveries has occurred in all regions of the country , although the @entity108 still has the highest rate of deliveries among 13 to 19 - year - olds according to its population size			0
in contrast , @entity96 has the lowest rate for teenage mothers , but the highest rate for older mothers .			0

18 per cent over mothers over 35 opted not to give birth naturally
@entity21 raises concern about a *quarter* of mothers having the surgery
but teen pregnancies down by a fifth in five years
