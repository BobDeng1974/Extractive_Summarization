by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 11:00 est , 10 may 2012 as a lone @entity3 wartime aircraft circled a blue sky in the @entity5 this morning , the landscape looked a picturesque scene of tranquility and calm			1
but sixty - nine years ago today , the view from the ground looked very different as the brave @entity12 crew took to the air , practicing for a stealth mission to destroy @entity16 's dams during @entity17			1
today a flying company offered war enthusiasts the chance to follow the identical flight path over the @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 dams in a original @entity27 biplane - the aircraft the elite @entity30 squadron would have learnt to fly in			1
step back in time : a second world war @entity27 flies low over @entity33 , retracing the steps of @entity30 pilots who trained there taking to the skies : @entity30 pilots trained in the @entity5 69 years ago today ahead of their bouncing - bomb attack on @entity16 on 17 may 1943 scenic view : the nostalgic flight is just one of many being flown by this original @entity27 biplane			1
it gives people the chance to experience the practice route over the @entity49 reservoirs in an original @entity17 aircraft mission : eight aircraft , such as the @entity30 pictured , failed to return , 53 men were killed and three became prisoners of war the aircrew from @entity59 headed to the @entity60 to train in extreme low - level flying in bombers in preparation to destroy dams in @entity16 ’s @entity65 using top - secret ‘ bouncing bombs ’			1
the @entity67 and it ’s surrounding hills resembled that of some of the @entity16 dams so formed a perfect training ground for the elite @entity30 squadron			1
pilot , @entity73 , 32 , said : ' all the @entity30 pilots would have learnt to fly in a @entity27 just like this one			1
' i fly as low as i can on the ‘ @entity77 ’ but i ca n’t imagine how they managed to fly those bombers at only sixty feet above the water – especially with people shooting at them			2
' i get a buzz from flying it , the provenance , smell and feel of an open cockpit – there ’s nothing like feeling the wind blowing through your hair – it ’s what i ’d call real flying			2
' i recently flew an @entity3 veteran who ’d worked as a ground based engineer on @entity96 during the war – he had never flown in a @entity30 but wanted to know what it felt like to fly over the dams			1
he found it very emotional – it ’s a very nostalgic trip for some of the older guys			2
' this is the only @entity17 aircraft that you can fly the @entity12 route in			0
the trip takes about an hour and you can even have a go at flying as we run in over the water			0
mr @entity73 , who is also a flying instructor and examiner runs @entity114 from @entity115 near @entity116 , with his fiancé , and pilot father @entity118			0
' twelve years ago i happened , by - chance , to be flying over @entity119 next to a @entity30 – it was part of the @entity122			1
seeing it inspired me to get into vintage aircraft			0
my dream finally came true when we set up the company and bought our @entity27 last september			0
we ’ve only been flying it since the end of march and it ’s already becoming very popular			2
' after the war you could buy an ex @entity3 @entity27 for £ 60 – or two for £ 100			0
they ’ve gone up a bit now – we paid £ 57,000 for ours , ' said mr @entity73			0
the 1930s designed , @entity27 was a multi-role aircraft			0
in its different forms it was used as a trainer , for reconnaissance , and as a light bomber			0
experience : pilot @entity73 , said : ' i fly as low as i can on the @entity77 but i ca n't imagine how they managed to fly those bombers at only sixty feet above the water - especially with people shooting at them ' legacy : today there are thought to be about 150 @entity27 biplane 's left in the @entity154 - most of these are kept in private collections with only a handful still being flown commercially the aircraft ’s 6.1 litre engine produces 130 horsepower giving it a top speed of 153mph			1
the canvas covered aeroplane remained in service until 1951 with a total of 8800 built			0
today there are thought to be about 150 left in the @entity154 – most of these are kept in private collections with only a handful still being flown commercially			2
a plan to dislocate vital @entity16 war industries in the @entity65 by breaching the dams which supplied their water and electric power was first conceived in 1937			1
but it was only in 1942 , that there were bombs which had the capacity to destroy the dams and the aircraft which were able to deliver them			1
the bouncing bomb was developed by @entity182 and he designed a revolving depth charge bomb which the @entity30 plane would be able to carry - it weighed 9,250 lbs. design : the 1930s designed , @entity27 was a multi-role aircraft - it was used as a trainer , for reconnaissance , and as a light bomber ready for take off : @entity73 gets ready to fly towards @entity33			1

its aircrew , were mostly volunteers and experienced personnel - they were from @entity154 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and the @entity205			2
on 16 may , starting at 9.28pm , 133 aircrew in 19 @entity96 took off in three waves along two different routes to bomb the dams			2
@entity198 attacked first at the @entity210 at 12.28am , but five bombs were dropped before it was breached			2
aircrew celebrations : @entity214 in @entity17 @entity198 , centre , with the air crews who took part in the raid on @entity220			0
@entity198 won the @entity221 for his bravery during the @entity59 raid the first wave ’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the @entity227 which finally collapsed at 1.52am			1
aircraft from the other two waves bombed the @entity230 but it remained intact			0
eight aircraft failed to return , 53 men were killed and three became prisoners of war			0
although the operation was not a complete success , for without the destruction of the @entity230 its effect on @entity16 industry was less than hoped , it was still hailed as a mission of extreme skills and bravery			1

sixty - nine years ago today the elite @entity30 squadron took to the skies in the @entity5 in training to destroy dams in @entity16 ’s @entity65 using top - secret bouncing bombs
the @entity67 and it ’s surrounding hills resembled the @entity16 dams that were to become a target
