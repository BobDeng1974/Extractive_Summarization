published : 18:38 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 18:39 est , 10 june 2013 @entity1 should mark the centenary of the @entity3 without being too patriotic – or causing offence to the @entity5 , ministers declared yesterday			0
commemorations would simply ‘ set out the facts ’ rather than making a judgment on who was to blame for the conflict , culture secretary @entity6 said			1
and communities secretary @entity12 also warned against memorial events turning into ‘ an anti-german festival ’			1
faces of war : two @entity1 soldiers on the @entity18 during the @entity3 the announcement came as mrs @entity6 revealed that two children from every state secondary school will be sent to the former battlefields of the @entity18 as part of a four - year , £ 50million programme to mark 100 years since the outbreak of hostilities			1
she said a range of national events would highlight the sacrifice and lessons of the @entity3 of 1914 - 18 , which left more than 900,000 @entity1 and @entity32 soldiers dead and affected ‘ every family , every village , every town ’			1
the programme will include a candlelit vigil at @entity38 on august 4 next year – a century after @entity1 declared war on @entity5 – and a remembrance service near @entity41 , @entity42 , where the first and last @entity1 soldiers to be killed in the war are buried			1
write caption here major battles , including the @entity47 , will also be commemorated			0
but there was criticism that ministers are reluctant to recognise the importance of the @entity1 ’s victory over the @entity54 ’s armies for fear of offending the @entity5			0
military historian professor sir @entity56 , a member of the advisory board for the commemorations , said the events should symbolise the reasons @entity1 went to war – to fight for freedom			1
‘ at one level it is completely accepted in @entity5 that @entity5 was responsible for causing the war , though i think it ’s actually debatable , ’ he said			0
‘ but with a possible @entity1 referendum on the @entity67 , they are worried about the centenary being used for @entity5 - bashing by the @entity68			2
for understandable reasons , given @entity5 ’s history , just using the word ‘ krieg ’ [ war ] is very difficult			0
’ mr @entity12 said it would be a ‘ tremendous tragedy ’ if the occasion was used to bash @entity5 and its @entity3 ally @entity75			1
‘ equally , it would be a tragedy if we forgot what happened , if we forgot why we fought , if we forgot we won , ’ he added			0
some £ 5.3million will be spent sending two ‘ student ambassadors ’ and a teacher from every state secondary school to sites of battles including the @entity47 , @entity83 and @entity84 from spring next year			1
around £ 10million of lottery money will help fund a series of cultural events , while £ 1million will go towards securing the future in @entity91 of @entity92 , the @entity3 ’s last surviving warship			2
mrs @entity6 said : ‘ every day of the conflict saw extraordinary acts of courage , ingenuity and valour both on the battlefield and on the @entity100			2
‘ it is right we remember and mark the centenary , bringing its importance alive for younger generations and remembering the price that was paid by all involved			0
’ @entity107 , the minister asked by @entity108 to coordinate commemorations , said he had consulted officials in @entity5 , @entity111 and @entity75 about the anniversary			2
he added : ‘ they are fully apprised of the need to engage , and the discussions i ’ve had with the countries leads me to suppose they wish to commemorate this			0
