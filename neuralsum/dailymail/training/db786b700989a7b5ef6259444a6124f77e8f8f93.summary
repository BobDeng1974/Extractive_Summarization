by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 02:13 est , 9 august 2013 the cap on university fees has actually had the effect of raising the average price for undergraduate courses , a leading education academic has warned			1
the maximum that universities can charge full - time degree students was controversially trebled to £ 9,000 last year			1
since then there has been a stampede among all institutions – not just the very best – to impose this sum , or close to it			0
competition : a professor at @entity17 says institutions are charging £ 9,000 to avoid looking like ' the cheap option ' but according to @entity21 , professor of higher education at @entity17 , this is purely being fuelled by fears they will look ‘ cheap ’			1
there are concerns among institutions that charging less could affect their status , putting off potential students from wanting to go there			2
‘ it ’s very unlikely that we will get an @entity35 university , ’ professor @entity21 added			1
meanwhile the lack of a price ceiling on postgraduate courses could explain their comparatively modest price of £ 6,000 a year on average , he said			2
but if these were capped , universities might move towards the upper limit for the same reason as undergraduate courses			1
the @entity47 government ’s controversial decision to massively increase fees sparked violent student demonstrations in @entity50 after the policy was announced in 2010			2
at the time , ministers countered concerns by saying most universities would charge more than £ 6,000 only in ‘ exceptional ’ circumstances			1
however , even before the hike was introduced , most universities indicated they intended to charge the maximum for at least one course			1
theory : the are fears that charging less for a course will affect its status and put off students official figures show six in ten now charge £ 9,000 on some courses			1
from 2014 , this will increase to three - quarters , while more than a quarter of institutions will demand top - level fees for all degrees			0
overall , annual fees will rise by about two per cent to an average £ 8,647 next year			0
discounts and bursaries available to students from poor backgrounds will reduce course costs to £ 8,425			0
but most undergraduates from middle - class backgrounds will have to pay the full amount			0
@entity81 , professor of public economics at the @entity82 , said universities also felt able to charge high fees for degrees because undergraduates have access to loans			1
according to some estimates , many students under the new fees regime will leave university after a three - year course with debts of £ 50,000 or more once living costs are taken into account			2
last week , a study found those who end up in jobs earning an average salary will repay the most under the loans scheme , because they will be exposed to more interest payments for longer			0
by contrast , high earners will pay them off quicker , while those earning less than £ 21,000 do not have to make any repayments			0
women were found to end up with the heaviest financial burden because they are paid less than men on average			0
the @entity112 said : ‘ the new system has encouraged institutions to compete for students on the quality of the student experience – not just on price			0
‘ we have ensured there is better information available for potential students than ever before so that there is the best possible fit between students and institutions			0

concerns raised by @entity21 , professor at @entity130
' it *'s* very unlikely we will get an @entity35 university , ' he argued
six in ten universities now charge maximum fees for some courses
