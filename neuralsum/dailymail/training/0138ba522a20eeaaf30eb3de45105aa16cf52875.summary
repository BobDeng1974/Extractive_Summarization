@entity0 believes @entity1 is not the greatest player of all time , and not even a man - of - the - match performance in the @entity6 final will change that			1
the @entity9 forward has finally delivered at a @entity6 in guiding @entity10 to the final at the @entity12 , and now has a chance to emulate @entity14 by helping his country to glory			1
@entity0 , speaking in his capacity as @entity19 ’s @entity18 , thinks @entity1 is ' a fantastic player ' , but not the best to ever play the game			1
he does n’t need to win the @entity6 to be considered a fantastic player			1
he does n’t need to win the @entity6 to be considered a historical player in this decade			0
but for me he is not the greatest player of all time			0
' @entity10 head into sunday 's final against @entity42 in @entity43 as underdogs after @entity46 's side demolished @entity47 7 - 1 in the semi-final in @entity49			2
but @entity0 thinks there will be little to separate the two teams at the @entity12 , and things the midfield battle could be key to deciding the winner			1
he said : ' in midfield , where @entity42 is very very strong because they have @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 plus an important fact which is the fact that @entity63 drops back , @entity55 drops back and they put many many times four or five players in a central area			0
preparation : @entity10 players train as they get ready for the biggest match of their lives formidable : @entity42 head into the final as favourites after they thrashed @entity47 7 - 1 in the semi-final ' it ’s where they are really strong and they start controlling the possession of the game and initiative of the game			2
' on the other side , its where @entity10 is also very solid , with the outstanding @entity84 with the tactical discipline of @entity86 with fantastic effort , running and pressing and covering spaces from people like @entity90 and @entity91 closing the sides			0
' so i think midfield will be a great battle and everybody will be waiting for the biggest talents to score a goal to win the match and both teams they have these talents			0
