by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 has been caught smoking again - and fans fear this latest off - field discrepancy could be a sign of a player set to waste his great potential			2
his skill and pace on the wing excited fans but poor discipline and time - keeping frustrated @entity40			0
all that paled into insignificance though when he was jailed for drink - driving during a loan spell at @entity45 - and on release he was the first @entity47 footballer to wear an electronic tag			1
@entity31 has since gone on to play for seven other clubs , and even played in a @entity51 final with @entity52 , but without an @entity10 cap to his name it 's indisputable that what was a great talent was wasted			1
young guns : @entity31 played in the same @entity9 youth team as @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 jailed : a promising start at @entity9 turned sour for @entity31 who was sent to prison for drink - driving aged 22 keeping track : @entity31 had to wear an electronic tag during the months after he was in prison @entity68 back before the money came in , @entity68 was the next big thing at @entity71			1
a handful of impressive appearances made him a fans ' hero before injury ruled him out of the side over the @entity79 period in 2007			0
former team - mate @entity80 likened him to @entity81			0
even when @entity83 's millions made their impact , @entity68 was still a key player and impressed alongside @entity85 under @entity86 before more injury troubles and three drink driving arrests			2
photos surfaced of him looking overweight and unfit in 2013 and @entity68 later revealed he had been for treatment at @entity91 for mental health problems - a sad end to the career of a player once tipped for the top with @entity71 and @entity10			0
fat lot of good : the @entity68 picture which emerged contrasts with his appearance in his early , promising days at @entity71 outcast : @entity68 was released from his £ 25,000 - a - week @entity71 contract @entity24 @entity24 was blessed with the sort of pace and technical ability seen to be lacking in many @entity15 footballers - and he helped @entity107 qualify for the @entity51 twice while being a regular in his country 's midfield			1
but he was also the poster boy of @entity107 's ' @entity111 ' of gifted players prone to scandal : he lived in a flashy penthouse , crashed a @entity115 into the @entity116 after a night out and generally ' succumbed to temptation ' as he later admitted			1
he was judged to be the aggressor in a famous fight with team - mate @entity22 on the pitch at @entity121 and after leaving @entity107 ended up as an expensive journeyman - spending the prime of his career as a £ 450,000 - a - game flop at @entity126			1
fight club : @entity22 and @entity24 were separated by astonished team - mates and opponents , leaving @entity22 's shirt shredded			1
they were both rightly sent off @entity22 a one - cap wonder with @entity10 , @entity22 was always at the heart of controversy during spells at @entity136 , @entity126 , @entity107 and @entity45			1
being charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and affray , questions about his attitude towards racism and his on - the - pitch brawl with @entity24 were among the low points - the first of which delayed his @entity10 debut while he stood trial			1
but before all that he was a key player in the @entity136 side that reached the @entity51 semi finals and the goalscoring , all - action midfielder was even voted their player of the year in that 2000 - 01 season			0
@entity156 another player whose playboy image got the better of him , @entity156 was ditched by sir @entity159 despite being one of @entity10 's most exciting wingers			1
his attitude to football was perhaps summed up in a conversation with @entity165 about why the defender did not want to go on a night out			2
@entity156 asked @entity165 : ' you do n't like nightclubs ? in nightclubs there 's beer , decent music , women , what exactly is there not to like ? ' sadly @entity156 is now probably better remembered for his appearance on @entity177 than his football , which says it all , really			1
the @entity181 shuffle : @entity156 was a fans ' favourite but his antics would not wash with @entity159 faded : once a flying winger , @entity156 is now better known for his appearance on @entity177 ( below ) @entity187 tall , powerful , fast and skillful , @entity187 was one of the stars of the new @entity47 era when he scored 22 goals for newly - promoted @entity191			1
but his outspoken nature - still obvious today in his media work - and supposedly poor work ethic made him unpopular with fellow players			2
during his time with @entity197 he assaulted then - girlfriend @entity198 and ended up having short spells at a number of clubs incluidng @entity202 before retiring with a disappointing three @entity10 caps			0
couple : @entity187 's relationship with @entity198 and subsequent assault arrest was a huge low point outspoken : @entity187 remains as controversial and opinion - dividing as a broadcaster as he was a player @entity209 there was a time when @entity116 was being talked about as a replacement for @entity213 in the @entity10 setup , such was his form for @entity216			1
but @entity217 was unimpressed with his smoking habit and ended up bringing @entity213 to the club and shipping @entity116 out to @entity71 - where he eventually ended up exiled from the squad			1
two @entity47 winners ' medals might be a decent boast for @entity116 but he could have had much more			0
winner : bridge scores for @entity216 against @entity9 at @entity226 in the @entity51 in 2004 waiting in the wings : bridge was constantly playing second fiddle to @entity213 , who he replaces here @entity231 any @entity15 rated as ' the greatest footballer you never saw ' has to make this list			1
friday has been voted @entity236 's greatest ever player despite a career that lasted just five years , and was said to be good enough to play for @entity10			2
former @entity239 referee @entity238 claimed friday had scored the best goal he had ever seen ahead of the likes of @entity242 and @entity243			0
he was constantly in scraps with other players and even kissed a policeman after scoring one goal			2
but off the pitch his behaviour was even more erratic and his drug - taking , police arrests , up - and - down love life and tendency to dance naked in pubs made him tough to handle			2
in the end he quit at the age of 25 saying he was ' sick of people telling me what to do			0
' loose cannon : @entity231 sticks up two fingers at @entity263 goalkeeper @entity262 after scoring in april 1977 record deal : @entity265 used the picture of @entity231 on one of their singles @entity269 @entity269 was your typical ' character on and off the pitch ' and wrote in his autobiography about spending his time drinking , gambling and womanizing during his playing days			0
his tendency to ' take the p * * * ' , as he put it , made him unpopular with other players and he never really got a fair shot with @entity10 before walking out			0
he also walked out on @entity281 and a place in his @entity51 - winning @entity191 side , which probably represents one of the best examples of an opportunity lost			0
competitor : @entity269 takes on @entity287 during his playing days with @entity288 fag - end of his career : @entity269 smokes a cigarette at the @entity292 pub in @entity293 @entity294 not the typical route for a footballer to throw away his career - @entity294 quit the sport to become a practicing @entity298			0
before that he had dreamed of an @entity10 cap and appeared for the @entity301 but never fulfilled his potential from his days with @entity303			0
he remained on contract there for 12 years without playing a game and later ended up working in @entity307			0
quality : @entity294 poses for a photo outside @entity310 , as it holds a @entity313 's conference			0

the *lifestyles* of @entity15 players away from football have *damaged* careers
@entity22 and @entity24 's famous fight helps them make the list
@entity31 became the first footballer to play with a police tag
@entity156 played up to his playboy image at @entity328
@entity209 's smoking was *disliked* by @entity217
