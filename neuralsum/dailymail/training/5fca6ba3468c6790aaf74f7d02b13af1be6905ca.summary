@entity1 president @entity0 today handed @entity2 an extraordinary pre-election endorsement , hailing the @entity5 prime minister as a ' great friend ' the glowing tribute came during a press conference in the @entity11 after a two - day visit to @entity29 president @entity0 , right , gives @entity2 a pat on the back as they depart a joint news conference following their meeting at the @entity11 in @entity29 today mr @entity2 , who has been in @entity29 for a high profile visit ahead of the general election , shakes the president 's hand images of mr @entity2 with the @entity1 president , who is more popular in the @entity5 than in @entity1 , will be seen as a huge boost to @entity45 hopes mr @entity2 has been in @entity29 for a high profile visit just months before the @entity5 general election			1
the two men dined together in the @entity11 last night , on mushrooms , lamb and warm pear cake			2
images of mr @entity2 with the @entity1 president , who is more popular in the @entity5 than in @entity1 , will be seen as a huge boost to @entity45 hopes of contrasting mr @entity2 with @entity56 's @entity55 to be @entity4			1
but the highly unusual personal support from a @entity58 president will delight @entity45 strategists and cause dismay for @entity56 , who hoped a visit to @entity29 last year had bolstered his image as a potential statesman			1
mr @entity2 revealed in an interview this month that mr @entity0 often calls him ' bro ' when they meet			1
' yes , he sometimes calls me ' @entity69 ' , ' the @entity4 said			2
the @entity1 president today said commentators had got into a ' tizzy ' about he meant meant by it and sparked a debate about even the definition and origin of the word ' bro '			2

he is one of my closet and most trusted partners in the world			2
on many of the most pressing challenges that we face we see the world the same way			0

' in response , mr @entity2 told the president : ' you are a great friend to @entity87 , and me personally			1
' however , as the press conference progressed it became clear that differences remain over the extent to which security agencies should be able to snoop on encrypted messages and social media like @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
@entity2 and @entity0 held talks in the @entity103 in the @entity11 on the second day of the @entity5 prime minister 's visit to @entity29 the meeting was dominated by discussions on tackling terrorism and the threat of cyber attacks images of mr @entity2 with the @entity1 president , who is more popular in the @entity5 than in @entity1 , will be seen as a huge boost to @entity45 re-election hopes mr @entity2 insists the security agencies must be able to intercept communications between extremists and terror suspects who use encrypted messaging services and social media sites to plot atrocities			1
but the @entity11 has been cool on the idea , arguing a ' balance ' must be struck between privacy and national security			0
the comments came after the two men met in the @entity103 office for discussions on ' keeping people safe from security threats around the world '			2
as police stepped up protection for their own officers and patrols were mounted in @entity138 areas , mr @entity2 called for @entity1 internet firms like @entity101 to do more to catch and report extremists plotting atrocities			2
@entity143 announced it was taking action after given ' the deliberate targeting of the police ' in recent attacks , including in @entity23 last week			0
there will also be increased patrols in @entity138 communities in addition to existing security measures			0
but speaking ahead of talks with mr @entity0 , the prime minister warned : ' there 's no way you can give 100 percent protection in a free and open society			1
' i would stress that while we have incredibly capable intelligence and security services , while we have very strong counter terrorism police there 's an enormous role for the public as well			0
' on the general threat level , the prime minister added : ' it has been at severe for some time , so people should continue to go about their daily lives			1
one of the ways we defeat terrorism is to demonstrate that our way of life , our values , are incredibly robust			0
' the @entity5 prime minister and @entity1 president have tried to present a united front in @entity29 , unveiling joint cyber-security plans and a commitment to securing long - term economic growth labour leader @entity55 had hoped that a visit to the @entity11 last year , and a meeting with president @entity0 , would help to prevent a ringing endorsement for mr @entity2 ahead of the election earlier they agreed an unprecedented level of co-operation , with a team of agents to help safeguard both countries			1
@entity87 and the @entity1 are to set up a joint ' cyber squad ' to carry out fake hacking attacks on banks , aircraft and nuclear power plants			0
a report from @entity5 spy chiefs today warned four in every five big firms in the @entity5 last year experienced some sort of serious cyber security breach			0
the @entity4 warned cyber-hackers pose a ' real threat ' to the @entity208 and revealed one attack cost a firm over £ 800million			0
he stressed there was ' need for a panic ' because @entity87 was in a very strong position , and working closely with the @entity1			0
ahead of the meeting in the @entity103 , mr @entity2 said : ' just as we have worked with our closest ally , the @entity1 , to protect our people and our countries from traditional threats , so we must work together to defend ourselves from new threats like cyber-attacks			1
' in the wake of @entity224 's attack on @entity225 , @entity5 and @entity1 security services will now establish a joint team of agents to confront the issue and respond to attacks			0
agents at @entity232 and @entity233 will work with their @entity1 counterparts to encourage information about threats to be shared at a greater pace			0
they will also conduct a series of ' war games ' to test the resilience of both the @entity5 and @entity1 in the face of cyber attacks			0
the first exercise will simulate an attack on the financial sector , for example on banks in the @entity208 and @entity249 , and will take place later this year			0
this will be followed by further ' war games ' to test critical national infrastructure – likely to include air traffic control , power stations and healthcare systems			0
