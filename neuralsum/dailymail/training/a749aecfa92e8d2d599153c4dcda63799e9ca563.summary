by @entity0 the naming of a child is a very personal thing , but you could help yours on the road to success if you pick a number of middle names			0

scientists believe that making use of middle initials in everyday life might be the easiest way to appear cleverer , which in turn can lead to success scientists have found that we trust strangers with easier - to pronounce names			1
simpler names make people come across as more familiar and less risky to know , according to a recent study			0
researchers at the @entity45 , found that people who speak @entity47 trust strangers with easier - to - pronounce names more than those with names that are more difficult to say – even when those strangers are from the same country			0
people are more likely to trust claims made by strangers with straight - forward names , they said			0

people trust strangers with simple names as they come across as being more familiar and less risky to know			0
‘ people ’s middle initials have a particular and powerful effect on how people are perceived by others , ’ @entity63 of the @entity64 and @entity65 of the @entity66 wrote in their study , which was published in the @entity69			1
‘ the display of middle initials increases the perceived social status of these people and positively biases inferences about their intellectual capacity and performance			1
’ one study conducted by the duo , saw 85 students from the @entity66 evaluate how well an article explaining @entity82 ’s theory of general relativity was written , @entity76 reported			0
the author of the text was written as @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , or @entity89 and the psychologists found that @entity87 was considered a better writer than @entity86 - without any middle initials			1
while they wrote : ‘ it seems that one middle initial is sufficient to produce the middle initials effect , ’ they noticed that @entity89 was considered the best writer in the test			2

the duo think that people are used to seeing initials used in ‘ intellectual domains ’ and therefore associate their use with a clever person			2

there is also a theory that parents who give their children more middle names have more resources available to make sure their offspring receive a good education .			0
