by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 11 february 2013 surrounded by her four grown - up children , @entity1 poses for the sort of snapshot seen in countless family photo albums			1
they had all just been out for dinner together and enjoyed an evening filled with laughter , jokes and treasured memories			1
yet hours after this picture was taken , mrs @entity1 , her children again by her side , ended her own life in a @entity16 clinic in @entity17			1
our last night : @entity1 ( second from right ) with her children ( from left ) @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 the constant pain of dystonia , an incurable nerve condition , meant the 71 - year - old grandmother felt life was no longer living			1
recalling their last evening together , her daughter @entity30 , 47 , said her mother had enjoyed herself so much she had stayed up late and had seconds of her favourite pudding , crème brûlée			1
‘ it was a lovely night – it was quite an informal meal as that is what we are like as a family , so there were no speeches or anything like that			1
‘ we all had cocktails , and we laughed and shared stories about ourselves			1
‘ we even played dare games and @entity46 was telling us stories			1
we wanted to keep the mood light			2
’ the next day , however , that fun - filled night seemed a lifetime ago			1
@entity1 ( right ) and her daughter @entity23 pose for a photo outside @entity16 mrs @entity30 , from @entity54 , her sisters @entity51 , 53 , and @entity52 , 51 , and their brother @entity53 , 44 , accompanied their mother on the short journey from their hotel in @entity58 to the @entity16 on september 13 last year			1
‘ @entity46 held my hand so tightly , ’ mrs @entity30 recalled			2
‘ nobody said a word all the way to the clinic			1
we just sat in silence			2
there was part of me still thinking “ this is n’t happening ”			2
it was hard to come to terms with the fact we were going to leave her there			2
’ her mother , however , was thinking of more immediate matters			2
‘ @entity46 went into practical mode , ’ mrs @entity30 said			2
‘ she started taking all her rings off and gave them to us			2
she gave me her wedding ring			2
‘ she checked who was going to take her purse and who was going to take her shoes			2
@entity46 came with a bag full of stuff , and she was n’t coming home			2
’ mrs @entity1 , a grandmother of nine and great - grandmother of six , paid £ 10,000 for an assisted suicide and cremation package at @entity16			1
she made the decision after her struggle to cope with her condition became too much and she tried unsuccessfully to take her own life			1
that resulted in her being taken to hospital and sectioned as mentally ill. but her daughter insisted : ‘ @entity46 did n’t have mental health issues			2
she wanted to die with dignity			0
and she got her final wish			0
’ mrs @entity1 ’s family meant everything to her , and she ’d tried to hide the pain for more than a decade			1
‘ she was very outgoing , very family - oriented and she worked all her life , ’ her daughter said			1
she said her mother had been a security manager who spent 25 years ‘ chasing shoplifters ’			0
at home she was ‘ always there with lots of hugs ’			0
despite her sunny nature , the agony of dystonia , which made her body twist and muscles go into spasm , left her life a misery			1
she was exhausted with it			0
her face was etched with pain			0
over the last few years it got worse			0
happier times : mrs @entity1 with her daughters at @entity124 in 1968			1
her family meant everything to her and she 'd tried to hid the pain for more than a decade ‘ she could n’t even watch tv			0
she had to sit in a certain direction because her head veered that way , ’ mrs @entity30 said			0
and when mrs @entity1 ’s husband @entity133 died of leukaemia in 2011 , her grief made her physical pain all the more difficult to bear			1
by the start of 2012 she was on daily painkillers , including liquid morphine			0
as the months progressed , she could do less and less			0
driving was impossible and even a shopping trip resulted in her giving up in tears after half an hour			1
that was the trigger that convinced her she no longer had any quality of life and she tried to commit suicide in april last year			1
when that attempt failed , mrs @entity1 was taken to hospital and sectioned as mentally ill. her family challenged the ruling and she was discharged from a secure unit after two weeks but remained terrified of being sent back to hospital			1
mrs @entity1 paid £ 10,000 for an assisted suicide and cremation package at @entity16 ( one building pictured ) when the opportunity to go to @entity16 came up , she decided the time was right			1
mrs @entity30 described her mother ’s last moments at the clinic			1
‘ we all went into the lovely gardens and took photos and had lots of hugs			0
and then @entity46 said : “ i am ready now , i want to do this now ”			0
‘ she had to drink this horrible liquid in one go			0
‘ it tasted disgusting so as soon as she knocked it back she asked for chocolate and drank some water			0
‘ and then she said , “ i ’m feeling really sleepy			0
i love you all ”			0
within two minutes she was asleep			0
it was exactly what she wanted			0
‘ quick , peaceful and dignified			0
it was n’t about us ... it was all about @entity46			0
‘ i am happy she is free of pain			0
@entity180 is something we all face			0
for some people it ’s about how long you can live , but for other people it is n’t			0
‘ they want quality of life , and without that quality , there is no life			1
