the vine clip was taken from a longer video which has now been uploaded to @entity37 and purports to show several cctv angles of the excited couple sneaking into the ground			0

@entity58 @entity57 posted on @entity59 : ' could the " @entity5 sex tape ' actually be a scene from the tv show @entity44 ? ' while @entity63 wrote : ' did the @entity48 break a story that @entity5 are investigating a couple having sex on the centre spot ? was n't it filmed for one of their shows ? ' but a pr firm for @entity5 - whose officials initially announced they would carry out an investigation - now admit the video was a promotional tool			1
promotion : the video was all to grab attention for a scheme involving grassroots footballers not everyone saw the funny side			0
one fan of the club nicknamed the @entity87 fumed : ' we are the @entity87 - not the sex addicts ! ' it is not the first time a couple have sneaked onto a football pitch to share a moment of passion			1

in an interview on a @entity134 tv chatshow to promote her book ' @entity137 ' , @entity131 revealed that the couple had even arranged for friends to leave the floodlights on at the @entity141 so they could see what they were doing			0
