@entity0 can pinpoint the exact moment he knew his twin brother @entity2 would make it big			1
the pair were representing @entity5 when their manager , @entity6 , confidently predicted that the youngest of the @entity0 brothers would become a @entity10 star			1
considering they were just ' 13 or 14 ' at the time , it turned out to be some foresight			0
but @entity15 was n't always the most talented footballer in the family			2
' he hates me talking about this , ' says @entity0 , who is preparing to face @entity20 in the second round of the @entity22 on sunday with @entity24 side @entity23			1
@entity26 defender @entity25 and his twin brother @entity0 smiles for the camera posing for a school photo @entity0 plays for @entity23 , who play four divisions below @entity26 , the club of his famous brother @entity2 the @entity0 brothers pose during an afternoon stroll in the countryside and have a close relationship @entity0 poses outside @entity23 's @entity36 ahead of the club 's @entity22 clash with @entity20 ' we were about 10 or 11 and on trial at a club called @entity42			1
i got picked and he did n't but my mum had a word with the coach and asked if they could take us both as we were twins			1
' the club listened to the boys ' mother and @entity2 has n't looked back since , having gone on to establish himself as a key member of @entity26 's back - four and a part of @entity55 's @entity54 plans			1
@entity0 's path to the professional game has n't been as straightforward as his sibling , who was born 45 minutes after him in @entity59 , south @entity60			1
after being released by the @entity61 at 15 , he spent six months at @entity62 before falling out of love with the game and quitting			1
' i decided that if i was n't at @entity26 then i did n't really want to play football , ' he says			1
' i just wanted to do what my mates were doing - getting jobs and going out			0
' his desire to forge a career for himself returned through spells in non-league with @entity74 and @entity75 before the opportunity to play full - time for the shots was offered to him in august , 2013			0
this weekend 's game against @entity81 is arguably the biggest of his career , particularly given the potential prize on offer			2
' it 's always in the back of your mind that you could be facing a @entity10 team or a side from the @entity92 , ' he says cautiously			1
the pair , pictured in @entity26 strips as kids , both played for the @entity61 before @entity0 was released aged 15 @entity25 , pictured next to @entity26 team - mate @entity97 , celebrates the @entity61 ' 2014 @entity22 win @entity2 and @entity0 , pictured on bikes on holiday , have grown much closer as they have got older ' the dream tie for me would be @entity26 but that 's a long way away			1
we 've got to get the result on sunday and we do n't want to look too far ahead			1
the boys are buzzing for it			0
' victory for @entity110 's side at the @entity111 would create the possibility of a third round meeting with @entity115 's @entity22 holders , a fixture which would almost certainly see left back @entity2 go head - to - head with right back @entity0			1
' i do n't think my mum would like it , especially given the positions we play ! ' he says with a hint of seriousness			2
' when we both played at @entity26 we did n't really like tackling each other and we always looked out for each other			1
he 's still my little brother so i do n't think i 'd be able to hit him with one of my conference - style tackles ! ' i think he 's more excited about the prospect of playing me than i am about playing him but we 've still got that brotherly competition			1
if i came up against @entity2 then i 'd just have to treat it like facing any other opponent			2
' for that 90 minutes we would n't be family , just players on opposing teams			0
i 'm sure he 'd be the same			0
' the @entity0 duo are all smiles as they strike a pose in matching @entity144 outfits as children @entity0 admits his mum would prefer her two sons to avoid playing each other in the third round of the @entity22 @entity0 and @entity2 pose with their mum during a trip to @entity153 over the summer but who would come out on top ? ' that 's a dangerous question ! i would n't mind a little running race with him at the moment			1
i 'm the fittest i 've ever been so it would probably be pretty close			0
' originally an attack - minded winger , @entity0 dropped into defence at the start of the previous campaign and has made the position his own with a little help from his younger sibling			1
' last season our right back got injured and i saw that there were only attacking players on the bench , ' he recalls			0
' i put my hand up and told the manager that i could do a job there and 52 games later i have n't moved			0
' i just try and watch his ( @entity2 's ) games and learn from the way he does things			1
the @entity10 is hugely different to the @entity24 - they get so much time on the ball			2
i ask for pointers and just try to take as much on board as i can			0
' @entity2 has been to watch me play more times this season than i 've watched him			2
he loves it down here and he has come out with the boys at the weekend too			0
he really watches the games and tells me a lot when he get home			0
' @entity0 beats @entity194 's @entity193 during the @entity24 club 's first round victory @entity0 admits he was a bit more naughty at school while twin brother @entity2 was more reserved @entity0 enjoys a bbq day with brother @entity26 and @entity54 team - mate @entity201 home for the @entity0 brothers is a house , or as @entity0 describes it ' a bachelor pad ' , in north @entity60			1
they 've lived together since moving out of their family home at the age of 19 and now spend much of their free time together , although that was n't always the case			2
' we did n't even walk to school together when we were younger ! ' he reveals with a laugh			0
' i was a bit more naughty at school and he was more reserved			0
we did n't always see eye - to - eye but we had the same mates			0
it was n't until we got a bit older that we became closer			0
' i think he was a bit nervous as he came through at @entity26 and he did n't really have anyone to confide in			1
that 's where i came in and we 've been inseparable ever since			0
' we both get in from training in the afternoon			0
i make dinner and he does the washing up			0
we watch tv , play @entity234 and pool - typical brother stuff			0
we 've got mates round all the time , too			0
' @entity2 often shuns the limelight which comes with being a top - flight footballer but @entity0 freely admits that things might be very different if he 'd been the one to graduate from @entity26 's academy and into the public 's consciousness			1
@entity2 is now the first - choice left back at @entity26 and is pictured here taking on @entity245 this season the pair live together in north @entity60 - @entity247 does the cooking and enjoys chilling out with his brother ' i think this interview would be very different ! ' he jokes			1
' the fame went to the right one of us			0
@entity2 is a model professional and i 'm not just saying that because he is my brother			1
' he 's a role model for anyone wanting to become a footballer			0
i 'd probably be on the front page of the paper rather than the back ! ' he did make headlines back in may , 2012 , when he unwittingly played international football for the principality of @entity263 , an unrecognised self - declared state located on a @entity265 - built platform in the @entity266			0
' i did n't know what it was all about , ' he says , the surprise still evident in his voice			0
' my brother 's agent asked me if i 'd like to be involved and i thought it was a charity game			2
' i thought it was weird when they played the national anthems at the start and afterwards someone told me i 'd earned international honours ! it 's a bit of a shame as it might have ruined by @entity54 hopes			1
@entity0 , pictured with @entity2 dressed as waiters , insists his brother is the perfect role model @entity0 revealed his brother @entity2 has seen him play more times this season than he 's watched @entity26 whilst @entity2 has lifted the @entity22 , success for @entity0 would be to reach the third round of the competition ' actor @entity291 and someone from the band @entity293 played too			1
i could n't believe it			0
i do n't really shout about it but it 's on my cv			2
' while playing for @entity298 was just a bit of fun , @entity0 is now completely concentrated on the game he once walked away from			2
playing at the highest level possible is his aim , with a return to the @entity305 with @entity23 a realistic goal			2
‘ i 'm not getting any younger now and if i 'm going to get back into the league then it 's going to have to be soon , ’ he says			0
‘ it 'd be great to do it with @entity23 , we 've got a great set - up here			2
' this weekend his focus is on the @entity22 , a competition his brother won with @entity26 just six - and - a - half months ago			1
success for @entity0 and his team - mates would simply be reaching the third round			1
@entity0 was speaking on behalf of @entity320 , proud sponsors of the @entity322			2
