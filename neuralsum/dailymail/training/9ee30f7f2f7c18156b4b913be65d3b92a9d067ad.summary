the effects of multiple sclerosis could be relieved by sending electric pulses through a patient 's mouth			2
the tongue is directly connected to the brain stem , and scientists are now investigating how stimulating the muscle could improve the rehabilitation of people with @entity11 during one experiment , impulses were applied to the patients ’ tongues , and over the course of 14 weeks , their balance improved meaning they were able to walk more easily			1
electric shocks applied to the tongue ( stock image pictured ) could help treat the effects of multiple sclerosis ( @entity11 ) , allowing people with the disease to walk more easily @entity11 is a neurological condition that affects around 100,000 people in the @entity27			1
the disease causes the insulation around nerves to become damaged , which disrupts communication between the body and brain , resulting in loss of muscle control			1
a team from the @entity38 , led by neuroscientist @entity39 , applied the electrical impulses to the tongue as part of physical therapy sessions , for the 14 - week duration of the trial , @entity36 reported			1
they discovered that their patients gained twice as much balance and fluidity of movement compared to people with @entity11 who did the same physical therapy exercises without the new treatment			1
@entity11 is a neurological condition that affects around 100,000 people in the @entity27			1
the disease causes the insulation around nerves to become damaged ( illustrated ) , which disrupts communication between the body and brain , resulting in loss of muscle control the team is also exploring whether tongue stimulation can be used to treat patients who are losing their sight , have had a stroke or suffer from @entity63 ’s			1
in a previous study , experts enabled a blind woman to see a flickering candle for the first time - via her tongue			2
researchers developed a tongue - stimulating system that translated images detected by a camera into a pattern of electric pulses that triggered touch receptors			0
the woman could perceive the simulation as shapes and features in space , so that the tongue became a surrogate eye			0
dr @entity39 explained in the @entity82 that nerves on the tip of the tongue are connected to the brain ’s stem , which is a hub responsible for lots of the body ’s basic processes			2
it ’s a good place to apply tiny electric shocks because saliva is an electrically conductive fluid , and stimulation can be applied at a much lower voltage than is required for skin			0
dr @entity39 said : ‘ we have probably discovered a new way for the neurorehabilitation of many neurological disorders			0

scientists at the @entity38 applied *painless* electrical impulses to @entity11 patients ’ tongues during a 14 - week experiment
multiple sclerosis ( @entity11 ) is a neurological condition where communication between body and brain is disrupted , resulting in loss of muscle control
experts found that treatment improved the balance of people with ms
treatment also *doubled* fluidity of movement compared to a control *group*
