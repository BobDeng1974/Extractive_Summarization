the charity stunt has lured athletes , celebrities , politicians and rock stars and gone viral on the @entity5 , but do n't look for @entity7 diplomats to get in on the fun			2
lawyers at the @entity10 have banned @entity7 ambassadors and other high - profile foreign service officers from participating in the ice - bucket challenge to raise money and awareness for @entity17 's disease , also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or @entity19			2
in a cable sent this week to all @entity7 diplomatic missions , the lawyers say it runs afoul of federal ethics rules barring officials from using public office for private gain ' no matter how worthy the cause			1
' former president @entity28 took part in the ice bucket challenge this week ( pictured ) the unclassified cable , sent on tuesday , was obtained by @entity32 thursday			2
the cable said public health and disease prevention are some of the @entity10 's highest priorities , noting @entity7 funding for global programs to fight @entity39 and @entity40 , malaria , tuberculosis , smallpox and polio and recent efforts to combat the ebola virus			0
and , it complimented the @entity48 on the success of its ice bucket challenge , which has raised more than $ 40 million and attracted a plethora of notable participants , including former president @entity28 , television hosts @entity54 and @entity56 and pro golfer @entity57			1
but it also pointed out that choosing among worthy charities can be a difficult personal decision that is made ' even more difficult when high - ranking @entity10 personnel with high - profile positions are asked to participate in charitable fund - raising , and concerns about preference and favoritism always arise			0
' ' there are firmly established rules preventing the use of public office , such as our ambassadors , for private gain , no matter how worthy a cause , ' the cable said			1
' thus , high - ranking @entity10 officials are unfortunately unable to participate in the ice bucket challenge			1
' we since wish the @entity48 continued success in its ice bucket campaign , and in its fight against @entity17 's disease			0
' by the time the cable was sent at least one high - ranking diplomat , ambassador to @entity86 @entity85 , had already participated and had challenged @entity7 ambassador to the @entity89 @entity88 to douse herself with ice water for the cause			0
but by then , @entity92 and the other ambassadors got the memo .			0

ice bucket challenge would go against ethical rules banning officials from using public office for private gain ' no matter how worthy the cause '
the @entity19 charity stunt has raised more than $ 40 million
by the time the *message* of the ban was sent , one diplomat had already done the ice bucket challenge
