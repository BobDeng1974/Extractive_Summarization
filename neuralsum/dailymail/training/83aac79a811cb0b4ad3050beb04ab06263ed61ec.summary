there 's no bigger beauty buzzword these days than ‘ detox ’			1
from deep - cleansing masks to purging baths , hundreds of treatments promise to cleanse our bodies after over-indulgence			1
some experts warn that much of the beauty detox market is little more than marketing hype			1
‘ the term detox is a medical term that has been hijacked by marketing departments , ’ says nutritionist @entity12			1
’ here , @entity30 tests the most popular detox beauty products and asks skin , hair and nutrition experts for their verdicts on which might work — and which to ditch			1
foot fantastic ? @entity40 , £ 3.99 for a two pack @entity40 , £ 3.99 for a two pack , nirvanahealthfood.com the @entity43 : adhesive patches you stick on your feet to stimulate the pressure points on the soles to release the body ’s unwanted toxins			1
@entity51 says : according to reflexology , stimulating the meridian points on the feet can help to encourage a smooth flow of energy to the major organs of the body			1
but can what is little more than a plaster achieve what a trained reflexologist can ? i applied the patches as directed — one to each foot — and they were moist in the morning			1
but was this toxins or sweat ? expert view : ‘ putting a detox patch on your skin may make the covered area sweat more , ’ says scientist @entity70 ( senseaboutscience.org )			1
‘ while very , very small levels of chemicals may be excreted in the sweat , it wo n’t have any discernable effect on the amount of chemicals in your body			1
’ @entity85 @entity86 , £ 1.89 for 20 sachets @entity86 , £ 1.89 for 20 sachets , pukkaherbs.com the @entity43 : a blend of organic aniseed , fennel & cardamom — natural ingredients said to ease digestion			1
@entity51 says : i certainly felt virtuous sipping this herbal brew instead of my morning caffeine fix			2
it ’s an acquired taste — i felt a little nauseous after the first cup — but it grows on you ( think aniseed balls dropped in hot water ) and it has to be better than my numerous cups coffee and tea all day			2
expert view : ‘ the spices in this have been traditionally used to support the digestive system and the adrenal glands — our internal stress management system , ’ says nutritionist @entity12 of @entity106			1
‘ the digestive system has a central role in the effective elimination of waste presented to the gut from the liver			2
’ @entity118 @entity119 , £ 47 for 1000g @entity119 , £ 47 for 1000g the @entity43 : these bath salts contain minerals small enough to penetrate skin cells and be absorbed to help the skin expel internal toxins accumulated through alcohol and a hectic lifestyle			2
@entity51 says : for optimum results , the blurb recommends tipping the entire lot into the bath , which feels rather decadent at £ 47 a pot , and brushing the skin with the bath mitt included			2
can this counter-act a month of drinking ? not sure			2
my skin felt wonderfully soft but surely you could get similar results by adding a couple of scoops of @entity141 at a fraction of the price ? expert view : dr @entity145 ( drsambunting.com ) is n’t convinced the ingredients will detox the body in a medical sense			1
‘ we do not eliminate toxins like alcohol through the skin — we do it through the liver and it ’s a very efficient organ at doing so , ’ she says			2
it will soften the skin , though			2
@entity159 @entity160 , £ 18 for 50ml @entity160 , £ 18 for 50ml , renskincare.com the @entity43 : a deep cleansing face mask , formulated with @entity163 clay to draw out impurities and reduce pore size by removing excess sebum ( an oily secretion produced naturally to lubricate skin ) and removing dead skin cells			2
@entity51 says : my skin felt smoother afterwards and feels less bumpy , but i still have some yucky blackheads expert view : the clay will help absorb excess oil , says dr @entity145			0
‘ this will reduce the appearance of pores temporarily			0
but it wo n’t pull toxins out of the skin			0
those with sensitive skin need to be careful as this can be quite drying , ’ @entity185 @entity186 , £ 6.49 for 250ml @entity186 , £ 6.49 for 250ml , hairmeetswardrobe.co.uk the @entity43 : a deep clean shampoo for overstyled hair — recommended for occasional use to remove dirt , product build up and residue @entity51 says : this is applied like a normal shampoo and my hair certainly felt less sticky afterwards			0
expert view : @entity198 , clinical director at @entity199 , is not convinced			0
‘ every shampoo will cleanse and clean the hair			0
in my opinion , the word detox is a fashionable term and a marketing ploy			1
this product does no more than a cheap shampoo from a supermarket			0
it is more important to choose a product developed to suit your hair type			0
that will make a bigger difference as will washing the hair more frequently			0
’ nail the trend shine buffer set , £ 49 for full nail - care kit shine buffer set , £ 49 for full nail - care kit , p - shine.co.uk the claims : described as a detox for the nails , this is based on a @entity225 manicure technique to enhance the natural pinky colour of nails by buffing without chemical - laden polishes			1
@entity51 says : after buffing with emery paper , you apply powder and then wax made of natural ingredients to soften the cuticles and leave nails a soft pink colour			0
expert view : ‘ we have a tendency to abuse our nails with all sorts of extensions , acrylic , semi permanent gel or toxic nail polish , ’ says nail guru @entity247 of @entity248 ( nailberry.co.uk )			0
‘ the @entity250 manicure will help smooth , invigorate and improve the natural lustre of nails leaving them glowing and shiny , ’ she says			0
amazing oil @entity254 ’s @entity253 , £ 15 for 100ml @entity254 ’s @entity253 , £ 15 for 100ml @entity255 the claims : this body oil contains the essential oils used for lymphatic drainage by aromatherapists and with regular use can help to eliminate toxins from the body @entity51 says : to get best results , it ’s recommended to use this after body brushing and a warm bath or shower which is all quite a faff			1
as directed , i tried to massage as vigorously as i could , concentrating on all the flabby bits like thighs and tummy			0
expert view : ‘ i think the vigorous massage is likely to be the most helpful element here — that could encourage lymphatic drainage , ’ says dr @entity145			0
‘ the aromatherapy aspect will improve the sensorial aspect of the ritual — but it wo n’t help with toxin elimination			1
’ @entity284 @entity285 and @entity286 , £ 29.95 for 60 capsules , theorganicpharmacy.com the claims : natural ingredients such as burdock root , leaves from the alfalfa plant , apple pectin and licorice help detoxify and rejuvenate the body at a cellular level			1
claims clients have reported weight loss , better digestion and glowing skin @entity51 says : popping three of these every night is quite an ordeal			0
i can report that i was more ‘ regular ’ within a day or two but my skin is n’t glowing yet			0
expert view : @entity305 confirms that the ingredients ‘ primarily offer fibre ’			0
she adds : ‘ there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients will improve skin , energy , mental clarity or weight but a well functioning gastro - intestinal tract can support good health			0

the beauty buzzword of the moment is ' detox ' but is it any more than a marketing hype ?
traditionally it means ' to withdraw a potentially lethal toxin from the body '
