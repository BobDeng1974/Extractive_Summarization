by @entity0 for 13 years , quangos and public bodies were stuffed with former @entity4 ministers and activists			1
the imposition of the party ’s supporters on everything from the @entity10 to the broadcast regulator @entity11 began the moment @entity13 seized power in 1997			2
of the senior appointments made that year , an astonishing 75 per cent declared political affiliations for @entity4			1
the @entity17 were instantly marginalised , with only 13 per cent of posts			2
spree : both former prime ministers @entity21 and @entity13 , pictured together in 2004 , appointed large numbers of known @entity4 supporters to positions of power during every one of the @entity4 years , more than half of all appointees with declared affiliations were backers of mr @entity13 or @entity21			1
on seven occasions , it was higher than 60 per cent			2
significantly , in mr @entity21 ’s last year , the figure hit 70 per cent - as the party prepared to put in place a ‘ government in exile ’ that would allow its ideological bedfellows to hold sway over public life even with a @entity17 prime minister in power			2
the truth is that however loud @entity4 squeals about @entity45 ’s ejection of @entity46 from her role as head of schools watchdog @entity49 , it remains in control of the unofficial levers of power			1
this is in part down to @entity56 ’s own failure to redress the balance			1
in a letter remarkable for its hypocrisy , @entity60 , the shadow minister for the @entity61 , yesterday claimed non-tories were being weeded out and replaced with placemen who would ‘ support the government ’s political agenda ’			2
the facts tell a very different story : since 2010 , three times more @entity4 supporters ( 312 ) have been appointed to powerful roles in the public sector ‘ quangocracy ’ than @entity17 ( 105 )			1
in 2011/12 , 77 per cent of those appointed to public bodies with declared affiliations were @entity4 supporters – worse even than under mr @entity13			1
last year , the numbers were more in balance , with mr @entity56 overseeing the appointment of 36 @entity17 and 33 @entity4 supporters			1
but this still amounts to only 37 per cent of public posts being filled by @entity17			2
by contrast , even @entity83 managed 57 per cent during his last year in office			0
here , we look at how @entity4 – which was spending £ 64billion a year on 1,162 quangos by 2010 – put its acolytes in control of almost every aspect of @entity92 public @entity91 left - winger : former campaigner @entity94 earns £ 100,000 for a three - day week as head of the @entity96 @entity94 has been head of the @entity96 , which regulates party donations and organises elections , since 2009			1
the former left - wing campaigner earns £ 100,000 for a three - day week			0
her partner , @entity100 , is a former @entity4 leader of @entity101			1
she was the last chair of the @entity103 before the creation of the @entity106 quango			0
in 2013 , she was re-appointed to her electoral post by the @entity108 was put into the hands of @entity110 – a former @entity4 council leader – in one of the final acts of the @entity21 administration			1
a quango veteran , she was also given senior jobs in the @entity116 , @entity117 and the @entity119 culture secretary @entity118 chairs the @entity120 , where he has come under repeated fire for the quango ’s handling of the @entity125 floods			0
paid an estimated £ 100,000 for a three - day week , he was first appointed to the role in 2008			0
he was re-appointed by then @entity17 environment secretary @entity128 in 2011			0
' cronyism ' : @entity130 's appointment as @entity131 in 2010 was forced through by @entity132 @entity133 teacher @entity130 was made @entity131 by @entity132 in 2010 amid accusations of cronyism			0
she does not have a declared political affiliation but a @entity138 committee rejected her appointment as they feared that she would be too obedient to the @entity4 government			1
mr @entity132 over-ruled them and she remains in @entity142 , the chair of the @entity143 which owns the @entity145 newspaper , was handed posts in charge of the @entity148 , @entity149 and , from 2009 onwards , the @entity150			0
the @entity152 and @entity153 executive was a vocal critic of the @entity155 ’s cuts to the arts budget			0
there were howls of protest from the left - wing establishment when her contract was not renewed last @entity162 was the @entity4 mp for @entity164 from 1974 until 2001 before being given a seat in the @entity166			1
he served as an immigration minister during the years the party was presiding over an ‘ open door ’ policy , before being put in charge of the @entity10 in 2009			2
his £ 60,000 part - time role put him in charge of @entity176 foods – despite being a past cheerleader for the controversial technology			0
new @entity4 adviser : @entity180 worked for @entity13 and @entity21 before being given control of @entity11 's £ 140million budget @entity184 senior adviser to both @entity21 and @entity13 , @entity180 was given the job of running the media watchdog @entity11 in 2006			1
he presides over nearly 1,000 staff and has a budget of around £ 140million			0
despite earning £ 380,000 , he ran ( unsuccessfully ) to be the director general of the @entity152 in 2012			0
@entity190 remains a favoured destination for men of the @entity193 , however			0
the @entity152 recently appointed the former @entity4 cabinet minister @entity194 as its £ 295,000 - a - year ‘ director , strategy and digital ’			1
@entity200 general secretary and minister @entity199 ( @entity198 ) @entity197 was made the chairman of @entity203 , the consumer protection watchdog , when it was established in 2007 and paid £ 48,000 a year for a three - day week			0
it was swiftly re-branded @entity203			0
in 2012 , ministers announced it was being @entity207 ( @entity206 ) @entity205 , a former communities minister and former adviser to @entity21 was put in charge of @entity210 , which looks after some of the country ’s most treasured buildings , in 2009 as @entity4 packed public bodies with its supporters in the government ’s dying days			1
her replacement by investment banker sir @entity219 has been cited by @entity4 in recent days as an example of a supposed @entity17 purge , even though he has no @entity231 notorious ‘ @entity222 was accused of using her £ 80,000 - a - year ( plus perks ) job heading the @entity225 to wage war on private schools , by attempting to strip some of them of their charitable status			1

for their 13 years in power , more than half of appointees supported @entity4
the balance has yet to be *restored* under @entity56
