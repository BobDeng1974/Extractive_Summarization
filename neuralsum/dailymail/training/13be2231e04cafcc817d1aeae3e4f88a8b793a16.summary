by @entity0 published : 05:00 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 05:05 est , 3 december 2013 schoolchildren in the @entity2 are still far behind their peers in other countries despite the money pumped into the education system by successive governments			1
the results of international tests published today reveal that @entity2 's performance has not improved over the past three years , with countries such as @entity12 and @entity13 leading the global league tables			1
business leaders said the disappointing figures should be a ' wake - up call ' , adding : ' school leavers in the @entity2 are among the least literate and numerate in the developed world			1
' poor performance : @entity2 is lagging behind many other countries in education league tables the tests , part of the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , measure the achievement of 15 - year - olds in maths , science and reading			1
the latest results show that girls are far behind boys in maths lessons , with female pupils less likely to enjoy studying the subject			1
and figures from @entity38 are particularly worrying , as its students performed worse on every measure than those in other parts of the @entity2			1
@entity38 is falling behind the rest of the @entity2 in reading , maths and science , the new league tables show			1
the nation 's teenagers scored lower results on average in each of the three subjects than their counterparts in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
@entity56 leads the way in the @entity2 in maths and reading , while @entity54 is ahead in science			1
the figures show that 15 - year - olds in @entity38 scored 468 points on average , compared with 498 in @entity56 , 495 in @entity54 and 487 in @entity55			2
in reading , @entity56 scored 506 points on average , @entity54 scored 500 , @entity55 498 and @entity38 480			2
in science , @entity54 's average points score was 516 , compared with 513 in @entity56 , 507 in @entity55 and 491 in @entity38			2
the @entity70 report concluded that for each of the three subjects , ' performance in @entity38 was lower than the rest of the @entity2 '			1
the results come despite the billions of pounds invested in education by @entity77 , and the decision by the @entity80 to ' ring - fence ' @entity2 's schools budgets while making deep cuts in other public services			1
education secretary @entity84 blamed the disappointing figures on the previous government , but his @entity77 opposite number @entity88 said it showed the importance of improving the standards of teachers			0
the @entity2 is in 26th place for maths , 23rd for reading and 21st for science in the @entity25 league tables for 2012 , which focus on applied skills rather than theoretical knowledge			1
the findings show that the @entity2 's average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499 , roughly average for all countries and on a par with the @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
@entity2 did better in science with an above - average 514 points , similar to @entity108 , @entity55 and @entity109			2
however , on every measure the country lags behind leading nations including @entity13 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity12 and @entity115 in @entity116			0
the @entity70 , which conducts the tests , said that @entity2 's performance was strikingly similar in 2006 and 2009 , the last two times the league table was published			1
' in essence you can say that the @entity2 stands where it stood in 2009 , ' said @entity123 , special adviser to the @entity70 's secretary - general			2
business groups were sharply critical of the results , arguing that there is an urgent need to raise the standards in @entity2 schools			1
opposition : conservative education secretary @entity84 , left , and @entity77 's @entity88 , right , disagree on how to improve the @entity2 's educational performance @entity133 , head of education and skills at the @entity136 , said : ' the generation of young people tested for the latest @entity25 report will be looking for jobs in a competitive and unforgiving global race			1
' unfortunately , thanks to historic complacency , the @entity2 appears to have its feet shackled at the starting line			0
' we know from previous @entity70 skills surveys that , despite billions of pounds of investment in education over the last 15 years , school leavers in the @entity2 are among the least literate and numerate in the developed world			0
' this latest report highlights these historic failings yet again , and raises further questions about the @entity2 's attitude to education			0
' girls in the @entity2 perform worse than boys in maths and are less likely to enjoy the subject , according to the results of the @entity25 tests			1
@entity2 boys scored an average of 12 points more than girls , a greater gender gap than that seen in most countries			1
the findings also show that girls find the subject less enjoyable and are more anxious about studying it			2
overall , 59 per cent of boys said that they are interested in learning maths , compared to 53 per cent of girls			2
the study adds that across all @entity70 countries , greater anxiety about maths is linked to lower scores in the subject			0
in the @entity2 , the proportion of students who had high levels of maths anxiety was lower than the @entity70 average , but girls were more anxious than boys , it says			1
boys also did better than girls in science with a gender gap of 13 points , larger than the @entity70 average of one point			0
but girls performed better in reading , scoring 25 points more on average , significantly less than the @entity70 's average gender gap of 38 points			0
@entity201 , @entity202 chief policy director , said : ' high - performing schools are the best way to support economic growth and greater opportunity			0
these figures should be a wake - up call			1
' @entity2 schools are treading water when we know that matching the very best could boost the growth rate by one percentage point every year			0
' no issue matters more to the @entity2 economy over the long term than the quality of our education system			0
' @entity2 's poor performance comes despite its above - average spending on education			2
the @entity2 spends an average of £ 59,889 per student , compared to an @entity70 average of £ 50,951			0
the report shows that around one in eight ( 12 per cent ) of @entity2 teenagers are considered ' top performers ' in maths , nine per cent in reading and 11 per cent in science			2
by contrast , more than a fifth are ' low performers ' in maths , meaning they can only solve the simplest problems			0
mr @entity84 said : ' these poor results show the last government failed to secure the improvements in school standards our young people desperately need			0
' @entity77 poured billions of pounds into schools and ratcheted up exam grades - yet our education system stagnated and we fell behind other nations			0
' he added that the performance ' underlines the urgent need for our reforms '			0
however , mr @entity88 told @entity251 's today programme that only a crackdown on unqualified teachers could boost pupils ' performance			0
' what we have under this government is a series of policies which lead to the deprofessionalisation of teaching , ' the @entity257 said			0
' it is scandalous that schools can advertise for unqualified teachers			0

@entity2 remains in the *mid-ranks* of @entity25 league tables behind @entity271 leaders
country has failed to improve its results despite @entity276 ' efforts
business leaders say findings should be a ' wake - up call ' for *officials*
@entity38 does worse than the rest of @entity2 on every measure
girls lag behind boys on maths tests because they enjoy the subject less
