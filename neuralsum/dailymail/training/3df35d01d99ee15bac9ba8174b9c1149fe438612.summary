changing views : a @entity2 paper backed by @entity4 dr @entity3 has signalled that gay couples should be able to have their relationships blessed in church the @entity2 yesterday signalled that gay couples should be able to have their relationships blessed in church			1
it said priests may ' devise accommodations ’ for same - sex couples ' who seek to engage with the challenges of life responsibly ’			0
it suggests that public prayers which recognise gay relationships could be introduced in church services by sympathetic clergy			1
yesterday ’s paper , backed by @entity4 dr @entity3 and the leading bishops , does not change the @entity2 laws which say homosexual activity is sinful and ban priests from blessing gay relationships			1
but it appeared to encourage same - sex couples , saying the @entity2 must show a ' degree of flexibility ’ over gay relationships , and adding : ' the @entity2 does not treat questions of what is possible in hard circumstances or exceptional conditions as simply closed			1
’ the proposal will infuriate traditionalists and is likely to reignite the bitter conflict within the @entity2 over same - sex relationships			1
the document likened the case of same - sex relationships to the controversy a decade ago over the remarriage of divorcees			2
this ended with divorcees officially allowed to have second weddings in church , if they can find a sympathetic priest , even though cofe doctrines say marriage is for life			2
the new paper on the church and marriage comes at a time of conflict between the @entity2 and @entity60 ’s government over same - sex marriage			1
laws permitting men to marry men and women to marry women are likely to be on the statute book within months			0
the @entity2 , along with other major faith organisations , has protested that the government has no power to change the principle that marriage must be between a man and a woman			1
the @entity2 has warned that the new law could lead to disestablishment , the severing of the 480 - year - old link between the @entity2 and the state			2
one of the bishops who produced the document , the @entity81 the right reverend @entity82 , said the paper did not mean that churches could stage public services of blessing for gay couples , which are banned by @entity2 law			1
he said that priests might offer such couples ' attention , care and prayer ’			0
but campaigners for gay rights in the @entity2 said the paper meant a green light for clergy who wish to give public recognition to gay relationships			1
' devising accommodations ' : in a foreword , dr @entity3 said the paper has been published because ' it would be timely to produce a short summary of the @entity2 's understanding of marriage ' dr @entity109 , a former @entity110 of @entity111 who is now priest - in - charge of a @entity114 church , said : ' you can not escape what is down in this document in black and white			1
' this is saying you can bless same - sex relationships as long as you do n’t say what you are doing			0
it is a wink to people like me who want to go ahead			0
' it is coded language which says do it , but do n’t advertise			0
’ he suggested clergy might offer communion services in which a same - sex couple would be invited to the altar rail during the blessing at the end of the ceremony			0
in a foreword , dr @entity3 said the paper has been published because ' it would be timely to produce a short summary of the @entity2 ’s understanding of marriage			2
’ it restates the @entity2 ’s position that marriage must be between a man and a woman , and adds that marriage is the ideal platform for bringing up children			2
tensions : the new paper on the church and marriage comes at a time of conflict between the @entity2 and @entity60 's government over same - sex marriage but the paper said ' in pastoral responses a degree of flexibility may be called for in finding ways to express the @entity2 ’s teaching practically			1
’ it warned that ' the meaning of such pastoral accommodations can be misunderstood ’			0
however , the paper said the @entity2 can ' devise accommodations for specific conditions , bearing witness in special ways to the abiding importance of the norm			2
’ the bishops said that although marriage should be for life , the 2002 rules on remarriage for divorcees ' offer pastoral support to those who with great honesty and circumspection approach a further marriage			0
’ in another comparison , they said that @entity2 churches in @entity183 baptise people even though they are living in polygamous relationships			1
the @entity2 , along with other christian denominations which do not recognise same - sex marriage , will be banned from staging same - sex weddings under mr @entity60 ’s same - sex marriage law			1
but @entity2 leaders - who are bound by law to offer marriage to any qualified couple who ask for it - fear they will be vulnerable to human rights court challenges when gay couples are turned away by churches			2
dr @entity82 said clergy could offer same - sex couples the support of prayer			0
' the form of prayer will depend upon the particular circumstances of the particular case , ’ he said			0
' but we are talking about that sort of pastoral care if you like , and prayer , rather than something which is more formal and more public			0
this is part of the private , the personal , compassionate attention that a priest would give to people			0
it is not about public , formal recognition			0

@entity2 may introduce public prayers which recognise gay relationships
@entity224 , backed by @entity4 , says church must show ' degree of flexibility '
but it does not change @entity2 laws that says homosexual activity is sinful
