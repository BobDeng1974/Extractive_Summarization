by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 13:17 est , 30 january 2014 @entity3 footballer @entity2 was given a six month driving ban for his latest speeding offence @entity3 and @entity7 footballer @entity2 has been banned from driving for six months			1
the 28 - year - old was handed four penalty points today , having pleaded guilty through a solicitor to speeding at 71mph in his £ 60,000 @entity11 on a 50mph section of the @entity13 in @entity14 in march last year			1
magistrates sitting in @entity16 heard that the winger already has nine points on his driving licence , having previously been convicted of speeding at 100mph on the @entity20 in @entity21 , making him liable for a ban under the rules on ' totting - up ' points			1
@entity2 had been given six points for an earlier offence in january last year and three points for another unspecified incident in 2011			1
wearing a black suit and tie , the winger , who reportedly earns £ 90,000 a week , sat silently in the dock throughout today ’s hearing			2
speaking before sentencing , in mitigation , his defence solicitor , @entity36 , said that at the time @entity39 was clocked by a speed camera near the @entity13 ’s junction with the @entity43 at 10am on march 7 , the road was ' quiet '			0
' he was driving on the toll road , it was quiet , and the speed was normally 70mph but had been reduced but not for anything in relation to an accident or any matter like that , ' she said			0
ms @entity36 also criticised the @entity54 ’s application for £ 405 costs , claiming that , had the winger been ' another member of the public ' , he would be looking at lesser costs			1
' in relation to the financial penalties i would ask for 28 days for mr @entity2 to make payment , ' she said			2
' just because mr @entity2 is who he is , £ 405 for an indication of a guilty plea - if it was another member of the public here today , they ’d be hit with the usual application for £ 85 costs for a guilty plea , not £ 405			1
' @entity73 , for the prosecution , said : ' in relation to the court costs , those were calculated for an indicated guilty plea a day before trial so preparation for that trial had already been carried out - costs awarded after trial would be £ 625			2
' so , whether it is mr @entity2 of @entity3 or a member of the public , the costs would have been the same			2
' the father - of - two was ushered into a waiting car by security after the sentencing at the @entity90 in @entity16 ms @entity36 also urged the magistrates ’ bench to impose the minimum disqualification period , ' because of his need for visiting his young children '			0
' mr @entity2 has family and two young children living in the @entity99 and his career takes him into the @entity101 , ' she said			0
' to see and visit his children he needs a licence to be able to drive			0
' she added that her client would not be making any application to avoid a ban under the rules of exceptional hardship			0

the player , who told @entity119 ’ @entity120 last july that he was ' deeply sorry ' for speeding on the @entity20 , spoke only to tell the magistrates he understood the charge , and to confirm his name , age and address			0
