@entity0 marked his first appearance on a @entity3 track in more than a year by claiming his eighth national record - and then declared his struggles this season had made him hungrier than ever for more success			1
@entity8 shattered @entity10 's 36 - year - old @entity3 record over two miles at the @entity12 's @entity11 on sunday , powering home in eight minutes 07.85 seconds to blow the middle distance great 's mark of 8mins 13.51secs out of the water			1
the double @entity18 , world and @entity22 champion 's time was also a @entity22 record			1
@entity24 ahead : @entity8 surges towards the finish , with none of his competitors anywhere to be seen record breaker : the @entity18 champion beat @entity10 's record that has stood for 36 years the 31 - year - old 's desire to add yet another record to his growing collection was clear as he pulled away from the field from way out and came home just shy of 15 seconds clear of his closest rival			1
@entity8 completed the 5,000 and 10,000 metres double at the @entity39 in @entity40 earlier this month , bouncing back from a torrid campaign which included a chastening marathon debut in @entity43 , where he finished eighth , and a frightening health scare which ruled him out of the @entity47			1
the @entity48 , who was watched by his twin daughters , @entity50 and @entity51 , on their second birthday , said : ' early on i felt a bit tired and then as i got into it i just felt better and better			0
i kept looking at the clock and thinking , ' i can do it , i can do it '			0
he now holds the @entity3 record over 1500m , 5,000m , 10,000m and two miles outdoors and 3,000m , 5,000m and two miles indoors as well as the half marathon			1
he has one more race this season - the @entity64 next month - before taking a break ahead of focusing on the track , and the @entity67 in @entity68 , next year			1
delight : @entity8 sinks to his knees after crossing the line to become the fastest ever @entity22 over two miles strain : the @entity74 pushed himself hard to break the record despite being practically unchallenged in the race ' ( i 'm ) not thinking about the road or anything			1
i just want to get back on the track and get ready for the @entity67 , ' he said on his aims for 2015			0
' when you 're at the top it 's harder			0
when you go through a struggle you are more determined , you want it more			0
' sometimes getting beaten or getting ill makes you want it more			0
' certainly two more gold medals and another @entity22 record was hardly a bad return from a season which has run anything but smoothly			2
@entity95 was equally impressive in winning over 800m at the @entity97 meeting at @entity98			0
the @entity99 , silver medallist at the @entity100 and @entity101 , gained revenge on the @entity103 who pipped her to gold in @entity107 , the world champion @entity108 , finishing strongly to claim victory in 1:59.14			2
sprint finish : @entity95 edges in front to win the 800m at the @entity113 the 24 - year - old 's achievements this year are nothing short of remarkable given the health and fitness issues she has had to cope with			1
she is due to undergo a third surgery at the end of september , the previous two operations to deal with a tendon problem in her left calf having left her with an open wound that requires twice - daily dressing			2
her @entity47 medal , meanwhile , came after being so sick the night before she was put on a drip			0
on the surgery , she said : ' they think there is an abscess of bad tissue inside so they need to take that out and make sure all the infection is gone before it closes up			0
' celebration : the @entity99 looks delighted with her win , which rounds off an excellent few weeks told by doctors it was a ' fairly ' serious procedure , @entity95 said she was ' having nightmares about it '			0
' we 've got to get it right this time , ' she added			2
' we are arguing over the expected recovery time			2
i 'm saying six weeks , they 're saying four months , so we 'll see			0
' if the problem is corrected , though , 2015 should be an exciting year , given @entity95 ran a big personal best of 1:58.80 at the @entity101 in @entity40			2
' i love championship racing and i think with the worlds next year and the @entity18 in 2016 , to medal at them is probably the next aim , ' she said			1
elsewhere , world champion @entity156 , who found herself in the unusual position of not being among the medals in @entity40 , won the 400m in 51.40			0
in front : @entity161 put her @entity22 and @entity47 disappointments behind her to win the 400m @entity164 again had to settle for second to @entity166 , the @entity167 who beat her to the @entity47 title , in the 400m hurdles			0
@entity171 , who has added @entity47 and @entity22 gold to his @entity18 long jump crown this summer , finished fourth with a best leap of 8.04m			1
the effects of a gruelling season were evident for @entity178 and @entity179 , the gold and silver medallists over 400m at the @entity39 , as they proved no match for @entity18 champion @entity183			1
short : @entity171 could only jump 8.04m , leaving the @entity18 , @entity47 and @entity22 champion fourth the 21 - year - old from @entity186 claimed a comfortable win in 44.59 , with @entity189 third in 45.25 and @entity179 , on his home track , seventh and last in 46.60			1
@entity191 missed out on a new world best in the rarely - run 600m , but still produced a dominant display of front - running to take the victory in 1:13.71 .			0

@entity8 runs a time of eight minutes 7.85 seconds
@entity18 champion breaks 36 - year record by almost six seconds
@entity74 wins the race by almost 15 seconds as he dominates on home soil
