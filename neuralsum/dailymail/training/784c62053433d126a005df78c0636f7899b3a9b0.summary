by @entity0 a gene linked to obesity is thought to trigger hunger pangs and affect a person 's ability to resist impulse eating , a new study has found			1
researchers at the @entity9 in the @entity10 said it could explain why people with the gene struggle to maintain a healthy weight as they age , suggesting some people are predisposed to becoming obese			1
various studies have linked versions of the @entity22 gene to chronic obesity , but scientists have struggled to determine how the gene affects a person 's likelihood to be obese , @entity16 , director of the @entity17 in @entity18 told @entity28			2
the new study has found middle - aged and older people with one or two copies of the @entity22 gene , appear to eat more high - calorie and fatty foods as they get age			1
scientists at the @entity34 in the @entity10 have found a gene linked to obesity could trigger hunger pangs in carriers , and affect their ability to resist the impulse to eat high - calorie , fatty foods			1
file picture scans of the 700 participants in the study found lower brain function in the parts of the brain that govern a person 's impulsivity and perceptions of food texture and taste			0
senior author of the report , dr @entity53 , chief of clinical and translational neuroscience at the @entity56 's @entity55 said : ' sure enough , people who carry one or two copies of the @entity22 variant show increased intake of high - calorie or fatty food as they age			1
' there may be a common biological factor underlying both the risk for obesity during aging as well as obesity - related behavior like your ability to resist impulse eating			0
' the findings , published in the journal of @entity74 , found 45 per cent of participants had at least one copy of the @entity22 gene			2
around 16 per cent of those taking part had two copies of the pro-obesity gene - giving a greater risk of a person becoming obese			0
a person 's body mass index increased in those participants with one or two copies of the @entity22 gene variant			2
researchers then compared the brain scans of those with the gene , and those without , to detect differences in brain function			0
the findings suggest those carriers of the @entity22 - gene have a predisposition to becoming obese the results showed people with the fto - variant had lower activity in the part of their brains scientists believe controls impulses and the response to taste and texture of food			1
a final step in the study saw the scientists review participants ' personality and dietary habits			0
they found those with a genetic risk of becoming obese , those with the @entity22 gene , were more likely to be more impulsive and eat more fatty foods as they aged			1
the results mean for those with a greater genetic risk of obesity will face an uphill battle to maintain a healthy weight			2
but ms @entity16 said the study does not prove a genetic predisposition to obesity means a person will be obese			0
she said : ' you may be genetically susceptible , but by living a healthy lifestyle you can overcome your genetics			0
you are not destined to be obese			0

scientists in the @entity10 have found carriers of the @entity22 gene are more likely to *succumb* to impulsive hunger pangs and prefer high - calorie foods
study could explain why people with the gene struggle to maintain a healthy weight as they get older
findings suggest some people are predisposed to becoming obese
