a toddler was nearly blinded after a pet hawk ripped his face with its talons as he played in a park			1
two - year - old @entity5 was in a playground with relatives when a @entity9 hawk named @entity10 swooped on to his head			1
her razor - sharp talons cut his cheek , narrowly missing his eye , and severed part of his left ear			1
@entity5 ’s mother @entity19 , 23 , said doctors had to glue the ear back together			1
terrible : covered in blood with scratches and tears all over his face , brave @entity5 just after being attacked by a hawk as he played recovery : still bearing the scars of the attack , @entity5 is beginning to get over the attack she said : ‘ there was blood everywhere			1
the bird ripped several chunks out of his head , including a big gash right next to his eye which needed stitches			1
' the doctors told us he was lucky not to lose his sight			1
‘ @entity5 was totally shocked , his eye was swollen and i could see his ear was badly injured too			1
‘ we called an ambulance and they whisked @entity5 off to the hospital , where he was given anaesthetic and kept in overnight			1
’ @entity48 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , said @entity10 ignored the calls of her teenage owner and ‘ dive - bombed ’ @entity5 as he stood in the park in a council estate in @entity55			1
but the hawk ’s owner , @entity56 , 18 , yesterday denied the bird had deliberately attacked @entity5 and insisted she was safe around children			1
he said : ‘ if she had meant to attack him , the extent of his injuries would have been a lot worse			2
' their talons lock into place , so she could have ripped his face off if she meant to			1
’ mr @entity56 said he had twice warned a group of children , including @entity5 , not to bother @entity10 while she was feeding minutes before the incident			1
‘ she can get a bit grumpy and try and nip you , but she would never draw blood , ’ he said			2
he believes the two - year - old hawk caught the toddler with her talons accidentally after mistaking his head for a landing post			2
on the defensive : owner @entity56 with @entity10 the hawk attacker : a teenager lost control of his @entity88 ( pictured in the wild ) , which then went for the toddler 's face and ears innocent : @entity5 and mum @entity19 were at this @entity50 play area when the devastating attack happened he said : ‘ he was the same height as the railings where she normally sits			1
' she does land on people ’s heads sometimes			2
it ’s something birds do because it ’s the highest point			2
’ @entity10 , who has a wingspan of 3.5ft and can fly at 45mph , has been raised from 16 weeks old by mr @entity56			2
named after 19th - century @entity106 naturalist @entity9 , the hawks can have a wingspan of up to 5ft , with the females about a third larger than males			2
they are nicknamed the wolves of the sky because they hunt in ‘ packs ’ they eat rabbits , rats and birds but are themselves hunted by great horned owls the oldest recorded life span of a wild @entity9 hawk is 12 years and seven months			0
but this can increase to 25 years in captivity			0
until the incident in september , he exercised her for an hour every day at the park			0
he added : ‘ kids would come out every day when i was in the park with her and i ’d have 30 children around me			0
' i ’ve had really young children , even babies , stroke her			0
she ’s never attacked anyone before			0
’ mr @entity56 , who is unemployed but dreams of opening a sanctuary for birds of prey , has had an obsession with birds all his life			0
his family have three @entity145 eagle owls , a barn owl and another @entity9 hawk , which they keep in aviaries in their large garden			0
mr @entity56 was arrested for assault two days after the incident but released without charge			0
he has been banned from flying @entity10 on council land , so now takes her to private woodland where she is free to hunt for rabbits and pheasants			0
an @entity159 spokesman said there was no law governing where pet birds of prey can be flown			0
he added : ‘ any wild animal kept as a pet is a challenge and owners have a responsibility to ensure they can provide for their needs			0
' @entity170 are wild animals and not domesticated			0
they have a very specific diet of raw meat and need to be given lots of space			0
