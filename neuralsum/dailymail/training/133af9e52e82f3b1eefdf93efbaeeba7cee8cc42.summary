exploring decay : @entity1 photographer @entity0 has traversed the world looking for crumbling beauty lurking beneath a thick layer of dust inside private bedrooms and public buildings globe - trotter : for years , the @entity1 has been traveling the world looking for boarded up buildings sequel : @entity34 is now preparing to unveil to the world his latest project titled @entity13 as a follow - up on his self - published book disciple of @entity39 hallowed ground : @entity34 has always been interested in religious spaces , such as deserted chapels and small churches that have n't been in use in years time lapse : this image shows what appears to be a deserted old movie theater with rows of folded chairs still in place phantom music : the keys on this dusty old piano clearly have not been touched for many years in an email exchange with @entity56 friday , @entity0 revealed that it took him more than a year to scout and photograph scores of different locations in eight @entity62 countries , including @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity0 explained that most abandoned properties , especially those that are the worse for wear , are open , but walking around crumbling homes can be very dangerous , which is why the photographer always travels with an entourage of no fewer than three people			1
‘ if i would fall through a floor and get seriously injured i would not be able to alert anybody , ’ he wrote			0
the @entity1 native also shed light on the hard work that goes into selecting the perfect location for a photo shoot , explaining that he relies heavily on @entity80 to pick out potential spots focusing on large properties that show signs of abandonment			1
‘ after that it ’s just trial and error , ’ he wrote			0
‘ jump in your car and go check it out			0
about 20 % of the places you find this way are indeed abandoned			0
’ while many of @entity34 ’s haunting photos of decayed ballrooms and hotel suites look almost staged , the photographer has insisted that he never brings any props or rearranges anything before taking pictures on location			0
‘ trust me , my backpack with camera gear is heavy enough ! ’ he noted			0
in all his travels , @entity0 said that a certain abandoned hotel in @entity105 has made an enormous impression on him			1
the inn had been ravaged by fire a few years ago , leaving it exposed to the elements			0
in one room , @entity0 found a bed covered in a blanket of moss , while in another the intense flames had melted the light fixture on the ceiling all the way down to the floor			1
‘ as a result , the rooms turned into scenes which could come from a @entity125 movie , ’ @entity0 said , adding that the hotel was demolished a few weeks ago			1
delusions of grandeur : this colonnaded ball room decked out in marble looks like it could be the site of a grand reception , if it were n't for the gaping hole in the roof just push play : the feeling one gets from looking at @entity34 's images is that someone had pressed the pause button on life sacred spaces : @entity34 's ideal shooting locations are ghost towns , insane asylums , dilapidated churches and castles frozen in time mr @entity0 explained that his fascination with deserted buildings first started when , as a child , he became obsessed with a creepy abandoned house not far from his home			1
‘ i passed it a zillion times until finally i had the guts to have a peek inside , ’ he recalled			0
‘ the adrenaline , the excitement			0
’ years later @entity0 was photographing rally races and rocks concerts when he came across pictures of decaying buildings that reignited his childhood passion for beautiful ruins			1
asked about any paranormal encounters on his adventures , mr @entity0 explained that while he is a ‘ down to earthy ’ guy and does not believe in ghosts , a memorable photo shoot inside a grand old hotel has left him shaken			1
@entity0 said he had encountered so many strange things inside the building – from doors slamming shut on their to inexplicable problems with his camera equipment - that he was glad when he finally emerged from the hotel			1
the most poignant and unnerving images in the @entity176 series depict rooms that look as if their inhabitants had just left , with pillows thrown carelessly on the bed and bath towels still hanging from a railing over a tub			2
besides derelict old mansions ravaged by time and debris - strewn hallways , @entity34 documented some more unusual spaces for his second book			2
one image shows what appears to be a deserted old movie theater with rows of chairs still in place and vegetation peeking through open windows			0
another image shows a weathered roller coaster covered in a thick layer of grime in an abandoned amusement park , where the photographer also stumbled upon a water slide overflowing with plants and draining into a chipped blue - tile pool filled with standing rainwater			2
@entity34 has made a name for himself in the art world as a photographer specializing in @entity211 , or @entity211 for short			2
journey into the past : looking at these image , one can not help but think that the owners of these personal items have just stepped out for a minute and will be right back water world : in his travels , @entity34 has come upon this abandoned water park with a slide draining into an empty pool overgrown with vegetation ghosts of the past : a water park that was once crowded with happy children and parents has been reconquered by nature last stop : this roller coaster covered in a thick layer of grime has not heard children 's terrified and joyful squeals in many years for years , the @entity1 has been traveling the globe looking for boarded up buildings , decrepit chapels and family homes where everything is still in place			2
in @entity176 , one particularly unsettling and thought - provoking image shows dusty old jackets and a woman 's black leather purse hanging from hooks in a foyer , and a pair of dirty slippers left next to a rusty bicycle waiting for their owner to come home			1
the feeling one gets from looking at @entity34 ’s images is that someone had pressed the pause button on life			0
his ideal shooting locations are ghost towns , long - shuttered insane asylums , dilapidated hotels and castles frozen in time and looking like at any moment their inhabitants will walk through the door and reclaim their personal space			2
crumbling beauty : even though @entity34 's interiors are being eaten away by time itself , much architectural and aesthetic beauty remains bleak : some of the shooting locations look especially gloomy , like this image of what appears to be a deserted jail or a mental institution eerie : this vast bedroom still bears the marks of its previous inhabitants , with white pillows resting on the two single beds joint together cavernous : this dizzying image shows a view from the top overlooking multiple flights of concrete stairs worse for wear : @entity290 has not been kind to this humble hotel room where everything is covered in moss and debris attention to detail : in this badly damaged bathroom towels are still hanging from a railing over a tub while some of the interiors in @entity34 ’s photos have retained an air of grandeur , like the airy colonnaded ballroom adorned with marble , everything in sight has been touched by decay			0
in 2010 , @entity0 ventured into the ultimate deserted location , the @entity312 in the @entity313 , where time stopped in 1986 after a deadly nuclear accident that resulted in a rapid mass evacuation .			0

@entity0 visited eight countries in @entity62 over the course of a year and a half to complete his new book titled @entity176
he relies on @entity80 to *remotely* scout possible locations before hitting the road to see them in person
to avoid getting stranded in a decrepit old building , the photographer travels with a crew made up of 3 - 4 people
