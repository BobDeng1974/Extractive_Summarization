what does it do ? bee pollen , which can be sprinkled onto salad or into smoothies , is said to boost energy levels , curb cravings and act as an aphrodisiac @entity67 , nutritionist at @entity68 , said : ' bee pollen is the pollen collected by bees from flowers ; if you look closely at bees in the summer you may see little yellow balls collected on their legs , this is bee pollen which the bee is gathering to take back to the hive			1
' these little pellets of bee pollen can then be harvested by bee keepers from the hive and taken to supplement the diet			2
' bee pollen is known for its rich and varied nutritional properties , it is high in proteins , amino acids , vitamins and folic acid			0
' it is unique in that it is high in nutrients other products of animal origin do n't possess			2
for example , bee pollen contains more amino acids gram for gram than beef , eggs or cheese			0
' it can help increase energy due to the high b vitamin content and includes large amounts of rutin , an antioxidant that helps strengthen capillaries and blood vessels , which can support the cardiovascular system			0
' bee pollen contains all the nutrients we need ; it is a wonderful vegetarian source of protein and contains all of the b vitamins , including @entity117 which can be hard to find in vegetarian sources			2

infertility problems : bee pollen may help women get pregnant because it stimulates and restores ovarian function , is a hormonal booster and an aphrodisiac how much should you take ? @entity67 explains : ' @entity160 can be made up of up to 40 per cent protein so one teaspoon of bee pollen ( 5g ) would contain about 2g of protein			2
' an average protein requirement would be around 60g a day so although bee pollen will only contribute slightly to that amount , it is the quality of the protein in bee pollen that is so beneficial			0
' what that means is that it contains many of the different types of amino acids that make up protein ; this is great because the body needs different amino acids as building blocks in the body			0
