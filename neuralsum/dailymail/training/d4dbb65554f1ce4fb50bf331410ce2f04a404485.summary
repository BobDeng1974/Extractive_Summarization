this is the ' invisible bomb ' maker described by @entity3 officials as ' an evil genius ' who could be a key player in looming air terror threats to the @entity7 and @entity3			1
chemistry student @entity8 , from @entity9 , allegedly created devices that can be sewn inside the human body - and are virtually undetectable at airport security			1
it 's these ' stealth ' bombs which have sparked a worldwide airport security alert the master explosives - maker first tried out his chilling tactics on his willing younger brother , @entity18			1
though the 22 - year - old was killed , he did not hit his target			1
intelligence sources fear @entity41 is plotting to smuggle the devices on to planes travelling between @entity7 and @entity3			1
the explosives , which have no metal parts , could be hidden in clothes or surgically implanted inside a suicide bomber			1
the technology is already thought to have reached @entity7 jihadists fighting in @entity50 and @entity51			1
it is feared they will return to target flights leaving the @entity7			1
the alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at @entity7 airports being raised from ten to 21 yesterday			2
at @entity60 , extra machines were sent to departure gates on transatlantic flights to allow staff to swab hand luggage at boarding as well as at security			2
electronic devices and footwear are being subjected to greater scrutiny			1
the measures are likely to lead to delays during the summer holidays when @entity72 alone has 200,000 passengers a day			2
@entity74 insisted yesterday that safety comes first			2
‘ this is something we ’ve discussed with the @entity3 and what we have done is put in place some extra precautions and extra checks , ’ said the prime minister			2
‘ the safety of the travelling public must come first			2
we must not take any risks with that			2
i hope this wo n’t lead to unnecessary delays but it ’s very important that we always put safety first , and we do			2
’ airports last night insisted planes would not be delayed – but passengers may have to arrive at gates earlier to go through the new procedures			1
it has also been suggested that ‘ sky marshals ’ – undercover armed police – could be brought in on some routes			0
@entity3 security blogger @entity98 said security staff at @entity72 were carrying out ‘ vigorous ’ physical searches , as well as extra tests for explosives , similar to those in @entity3			1
‘ there was also a lot of swabbing going on , people ’s belongings , their clothes and shoes , they even swabbed a baby ’s pushchair , ’ she said			1
‘ people were being checked for iphones and things like that , but the biggest difference was in the physical checking of people ’s bodies			0
’ delayed : the new measures are likely to lead to longer queues , delays and increased checks at airports , as well as an influx of sky marshals on some transatlantic routes @entity129 , a student , said : ‘ the security guys were paying a lot of attention to everyone ’s bags and items as they went through the scanners			0
it seemed to take twice as long for each bag to go through , i ’ve never seen it done like that and i have travelled a lot			0
‘ there were a lot of bags being taken aside too , when they came out the other side , for extra searches			0
’ a @entity3 @entity148 official would only say the measures were a response to a ‘ real time , credible ’ threat			0
for the past five years jihadists in @entity153 have been working on ‘ artfully - concealed devices ’ – explosives that contain no metal and emit only a faint vapour and can be disguised inside items such as shoes , soft drink bottles and clothing			1
intelligence points to bombmakers from the group @entity164 and tutored by @entity8			1
the official @entity7 threat status remains unchanged at ‘ substantial ’ , the third grade in a five - level rating			0
a @entity169 spokesman said : ‘ we have taken the decision to step up some of our aviation security measures			0
for obvious reasons , we will not be commenting in detail on those changes			0
‘ the majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity179 cautioned that the new checks were unlikely to be ‘ a one - off , temporary thing ’			0
‘ this is the world we now live in , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t want people to think that this is some sort of blip for a week			0
' this is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks in our airports – and indeed other places of entry and exits from countries – keep up with what we know from intelligence and other sources about the nature of the threats we face			1
’ the tightening of security came as a message was posted on a @entity206 page purporting to be that of a @entity7 jihadi in @entity51 , saying the @entity7 was ‘ afraid ’ he might come back with skills he had learned fighting with terror group @entity211			0
the message was posted yesterday on an account believed to belong to @entity214 , from @entity215 , who appeared in an @entity211 propaganda video last week			0
he tweeted alongside a picture of makeshift bombs .			0

intelligence sources fear @entity41 planning to smuggle devices on planes
the explosives , which have no metal parts , could be hidden in clothes
or they could be surgically implanted inside a suicide bomber
they are the creation of ' evil genius ' @entity9 bomb maker @entity8
