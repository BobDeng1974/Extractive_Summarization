television companies must try and stop children from embarrassing themselves on air , amid fears that their parents may not always have their best interests at heart			2
@entity7 , the broadcasting regulator , called for the crackdown after a flood of viewer complaints about the way children are treated on shows like @entity14 or @entity15 , where they are openly mocked or shown in severe distress			1
in one instance , a 17 - year - old guest on @entity15 was accused of having slept with 33 men , and told that her mother would disown her for stealing			1
viewers complained that the individuals sacrificed their ‘ dignity ’ for entertainment , even though their own parents did not complain about the treatment			0
in a new set of guidelines , which raise worrying questions about the lengths people will go to for fame , @entity7 has now told television producers to be wary about parents ’ motives for allowing their children on air			1
broadcasters should ‘ form their own judgements ’ about how much children should be allowed to do or say on camera , and not ‘ rely solely on the assurances of parents or guardians , particularly where vested interests may be involved , ’ it said			2
the warning comes amid growing concerns that parents allow their children to embarrass themselves on television in exchange for a fee , or because they are offered all - expenses paid hospitality , including restaurant meals and overnight stays in hotels			2
other parents allow their offspring on air in the hope that they will become celebrities , a source said			0
broadcasters should continue featuring children in their programmes , but they must take care that they are emotionally and mentally mature enough to cope with the public exposure , @entity7 said			1
‘ children form strong views and feelings from a very early age and these deserve to be seen and heard in programmes			0
however , the ability of participants to weigh up the potential consequences of participation can vary widely			0
in another instance , children were ‘ vilified ’ on @entity14 , the @entity26 series which follows a street - full of families which live off state welfare			1
pictured is @entity14 where the show was set ‘ children and young people differ in their vulnerabilities and resilience ; their age , gender , physical and mental capacity , their maturity , their cultural , ethnic and religious background and their previous life experiences can all affect how they might respond to specific circumstances and nature of performance			1
’ @entity7 warned television companies to watch children ’s body language , and made it explicit that they have a choice to opt out of appearing on television , in order to ensure that they are not being pushed into it by adults			1
and even if broadcasters do think they can deal with the public profile , children must be taught how to deal with potential bullying , including on social media platforms like @entity121 and @entity122			0
there has been a huge increase in online bullying since @entity7 last updated its guidelines for protecting minors , six years ago , but the rise of this so - called ‘ trolling ’ now needs to be factored in at ‘ an early stage ’ of production , the regulator said			2
‘ broadcasters should consider the impact of social media and the risk of bullying , including online bullying , on the child participant , and take appropriate steps to advise the young person and their parents [ or ] carers ’			0
the crackdown follows a string of controversies about the way children are treated on air			0
in late 2013 , @entity148 was found guilty of breaching broadcasting rules for airing an episode of @entity15 , where a guest called her 17 - year - old sister a ‘ silly anorexic slapper ’ , and alleged that she had slept with 33 men			1
the teenager was visibly distressed as she was attacked on air			0
she was also accused of stealing her mother ’s camera , and told that she would never see her mother again if she failed a lie detector test protesting her innocence .			0
