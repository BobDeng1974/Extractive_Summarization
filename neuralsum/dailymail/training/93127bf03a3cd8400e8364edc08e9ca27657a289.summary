a study found that those who ate raw garlic were significantly less likely to get lung cancer , even if they smoked eating raw garlic just twice a week can almost halve the risk of lung cancer , new research shows			1
a study carried out in @entity10 found adults regularly consuming raw garlic as part of their diet were 44 per cent less likely to suffer the disease			1
even when researchers allowed for whether people smoked - the biggest single cause of lung cancer - they found garlic still seemed to reduce the dangers by around 30 per cent			1
around 40,000 people a year are diagnosed with lung cancer in @entity25 and @entity26 alone			1
smoking is thought to cause at least 80 per cent of cases and fewer than one in ten sufferers are still alive five years after their diagnosis			0
previous studies have suggested garlic can protect the lungs against various conditions , as well as ward off other malignancies such as bowel cancer			2
one study at the @entity40 suggested the popular herb could slash the risk of bowel tumours by nearly a third			0
in the latest investigation , scientists at @entity46 and @entity47 compared 1,424 lung cancer patients with 4,500 healthy adults			2
each one was quizzed on their dietary and lifestyle habits , including how often they consumed garlic and whether they smoked			0
the results , published online in the journal @entity58 , showed those who ate raw garlic at least twice a week were significantly less likely to get lung cancer , even if they smoked or were exposed to high - temperature cooking oil fumes , thought to be another trigger for the disease			1

other studies have found it may help ward off the common cold , hospital superbugs and even malaria			0
in a report on their findings the researchers said : ' @entity96 may potentially serve as a preventive agent for lung cancer			2
