by @entity0 it might not be @entity2 , but this robot ’s work certainly provokes a reaction			0
when let loose on paper , the robot runs riot drawing bold , bizarre and seemingly random shapes			0
the machine , named @entity10 , is programmed with an algorithm created by @entity13 - based artist @entity12			2
‘ i did a lot of work recently where i wrote custom computer software to generate drawings that look very similar to my own hand drawn ones , ’ creator mr @entity12 told @entity20			0
‘ creating a robot that would actually use a pen to bring these drawings into a physical form was a logical next step			0
’ ‘ i think the drawings have a quality to them that make them interesting on their own , even if you do n’t know the whole robot story or that they were created by a robot , ' said mr @entity12 each piece of art is entirely unique and there is no clear logic to how the pieces fit together @entity10 is a custom built differential drive robot consisting of two dc motors with encoders at each of the motor shafts			1
each piece of art is entirely unique and there is no clear logic to how the pieces fit together			1
according to mr @entity12 , the intention was to leave it open to the audience to find the connections that make sense to them			1
‘ the reactions have been extremely positive , ’ said mr @entity12			0
according to mr @entity12 , the intention was to leave it open to the audience to find the connections that make sense to them judging from its most recent work , @entity10 is going through an outlandish abstract phase at the moment ‘ i think the drawings have a quality to them that make them interesting on their own , even if you do n’t know the whole robot story or that they were created by a robot			1
’ mr @entity12 has previously used computer algorithms to create a wall of randomly generated , unique faces , and hopes to continue to explore how robots can create works of art. @entity10 is a custom built differential drive robot consisting of two dc motors with encoders at each of the motor shafts			2

artist *designed* algorithm that makes the robot **'s** pictures look hand - drawn
there is no clear logic to how any of @entity10 **'s** pieces fit together
the intention was to leave it open to the audience to find connections that make sense to them
