by @entity0 published : 17:44 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 13 may 2013 can tapping your cheek ward off cancer ? my ten - year - old is watching me from the door , looking bemused			1
i 'm sitting at the end of my bed gently tapping parts of my body in a sequence i repeat ten times			1
the only thing that makes this scene slightly less embarrassing for her is that i 'm doing it in private rather than on the bench outside her school			2
' interesting , ' she says , like @entity21 describing a rare encounter with a strange endangered species			2
i hold up a book for her to look at as i tap and watch her roll her eyes			2
she does n't care that i am waving around a book that guarantees it will change my life			2
a book that claims it can alleviate stress , cure pain , banish addictions , fight phobias and relieve exhaustion			2
it describes itself as so ' revolutionary ' that it holds the key to ' emotional freedom ' and a life of fearless happiness			2
i want some of that , obviously			2
and this book even comes close to claiming its techniques can help cure cancer or , at the very least , enable sufferers to live longer			2
now those are serious promises			2
the author , @entity49 , says he has been using his tapping methods to help those affected by the @entity53 tragedy			1
he is helping to heal the community of @entity55 , @entity56 after the mass murder of 20 schoolchildren and six teachers last december			2
indeed , @entity60 is already on the @entity62 bestseller list just a week after publication			2
so it deserves to be tested properly			2
but i 'm a cynic			1
at the glossy magazine i edit , we 're sent books which promise to have ' the answer ' for a stressed - out generation battling with recession , family woes and all manner of health issues on a daily basis			1
i have n't even mentioned the diet ones , the career ones or anything by @entity80			0
i do n't think any of those books gave us anything we could n't work out ourselves			0
want to lose weight ? eat less and move more			0
got depression ? see a gp			0
the secret to being successful ? work harder			0
but ( oh , the irony ) even a sceptic like me still holds out hope for the book that really does deliver on the stress - free living promise			1
' scratch any cynic , ' as the quote goes , ' and you will find a disappointed idealist '			1
i have four children aged two to ten , a diabetic dog that could pop its clogs at any minute , ailing relatives to care for and a full - time job with 33 staff to manage			1
sometimes at night when my enormous to - do list stops me sleeping and i 'm battling my fourth cold that week , my chest starts to feel so tight i think my heart may burst out of it			1
the ringing in my ears gets worse , my head aches and my eyes twitch			1
i fear the morning because my day starts when the toddler rises at 5am , yet i still struggle to fit everything in by school drop - off			1
being able to multi-task is a curse			0
i 'd love to be able to handle life more calmly - without feeling a failure or relying on three coffees before the dawn chorus			1
the @entity60 says it can help			0
but can @entity119 , the world 's biggest disbeliever , embrace a book with such a ridiculous title ? can i trust a book that explains at great length why tapping repeatedly on acupuncture points will cure anything from post-traumatic stress to disastrous weight gain ? actually , after a week of tapping away , i think the answer is yes			1
let me explain how you do it			0
before you tap , you need to work out your @entity133 ( @entity134 )			0
so i settle for : ' i do n't have enough time			0
i feel overwhelmed and drained			0
' an @entity133 could be anything from ' i ca n't stop smoking ' to ' my back is so painful it 's stopping me sleeping '			0
basically , it 's the thing ruining your life right now - but the book devotes eight chapters to different potential @entity143 , from losing weight to making money , and how to deal with them			1
then you rate the issue on a scale of one to ten in terms of how it is affecting you			0
anything over five deserves ' tapping out '			1
for the next five minutes , you tap on eight acupuncture points in the following order : eyebrow , temple , cheek , nose , chin , collarbone , underarm and head			1
as you do this you repeat a sentence , which tackles your ' limiting beliefs '			0
you say : ' i feel overwhelmed and drained but i deeply and completely accept myself			0
' @entity49 , says he has been using his tapping methods to help those affected by the @entity53 tragedy i felt silly saying this because as i tapped away i wanted to say : ' @entity169 ' , but here 's the clever bit			1
as you tap you start to think through the situation - it is almost enforced meditation			1
as the days pass you tap with a more positive sentence ' i choose not to feel like this ' or ' i choose to believe that if i do n't get it all done i am not a failure and a rubbish mother			0
' self - confessed cynic @entity0 says she 's a tapping convert tapping helps change your language , so you say ' could ' rather than ' should ' for example			1
the author believes this sets off a physiological change and sends out chemical signals which train your brain to be more positive			0
after two days tapping , i felt significantly calmer			1
most of my tapping was done in the loo as i did n't want the children to @entity193 me or send off a home video to you 've been framed to win Â £ 250			1
i also tapped watching @entity197 at 6am beside a bemused two - year - old			1
i kept the blinds drawn so the commuters walking past the kitchen window would n't see my odd ritual and call an ambulance			0
i thought about tapping in my office at work but the fear of discovery was too great			1
at first the tapping made me angry			1
it irritated me to say things out loud , and i found it tough to focus			0
my mind would wander to the pile of washing that needed doing			0
what became clear is the more you repeat something , the more true it becomes			0
a lot of us fear that failing in one area of our day - to - day lives - skipping the gym or forgetting to stack the dishwasher - means we have failed overall , but if you keep telling yourself that today you choose not to tick everything off the to - do list rather than that you have failed to do so , it starts to make you feel calmer			1
when i began i also felt profoundly down for some reason , but as the days passed i was cheered			0
it was free ; no one need know i was doing it			0
i slept better and my headache disappeared			0
the tapping sends electrical impulses through the body , according to the author , which ' clears blockages '			1
i do n't know how this works but it seemed to for me			0
in the book there are many case studies : @entity246 the water phobic , who dipped her toes in the pool after one tapping session ; a 50 - year - old lung cancer sufferer who went into remission after four months of tapping ; a woman with chronic pain who tapped herself better and a breast cancer sufferer with insomnia who slept through after one day of tapping			1
these may or may not be credible stories ( i 'm sceptical about the cancer remission ) but there is science to back up the claims			0
still , i think a lot of it is simply the result of us wanting it to work , especially in cases of extreme illness where all other alternatives have been tried			0
but for what it 's worth i 'm a convert			0
tapping seems to flick a mental switch , asking your subconscious to solve your problems for you			2
and after all that is when self - help works best , when it 's delegated			2
