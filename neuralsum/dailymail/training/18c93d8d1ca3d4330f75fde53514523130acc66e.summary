these amazing images were captured by a professional photographer who flew along the @entity3 coastline in @entity4 over the summer			1
as thousands of sun worshipers lazed on the golden sands , sheltering underneath massive beach umbrellas , @entity6 photographer @entity5 took these stunning photographs			2
the colourful umbrellas create amazing geometric patterns which contrast dramatically with the golden sand and azure - coloured sea			2
from his aerial vantage point the people on the beach and swimming in the sea are mere specks compared to the bright coloured umbrellas			0
mr @entity5 told @entity22 : ' the message might be to show the impact of human beings on the natural environment			0
' on the other side , the birds - eye view reveals that we are just small creatures , not as important as we think we are			0
' @entity6 photographer @entity5 flew along the length of the @entity3 coast in @entity4 with his camera to capture images of people at the beach the unusual beach photographs have turned the people enjoying themselves into little specks with the beach umbrellas creating the most amazing patterns mr @entity5 took different style photographs , with long shots showing long sections of beach with others zoomed in to concentrate on the complex visual patterns in some of the photographs , such as the one on the left , the people are completely unaware they are being photographed , but there are people looking up on the right from the air it is possible to see how almost every inch of sand is used on a busy summer 's day on the @entity3 coastline this beach appears to offer slightly more privacy with some clear space between the rows of sun loungers all of which are placed in impressively straight lines in this photograph the footsteps of the holiday makers have made interesting patterns in the sand as people move from the shaded area towards the bar @entity5 said his work questions the impact that humans have on the earth , but also shows how small and insignificant they actually are the aerial photographs show that along large sections of the @entity4 @entity3 coast , not one inch of sand is wasted as sun loungers are placed up to the tide mark from 1,000 feet in the air , the beach volley game looks slightly strange as the net appears as a small green line here the beige colour of the umbrellas makes them virtually anonymous with in this instance the main focus are the people surrounding the small red boat in comparison to the previous photograph , the umbrellas in this image create a confusing optical illusion making it difficult to focus for any length of time these central sun loungers seem to be surrounded by bamboo fences to protect the sun worshipers ' privacy - but not from mr @entity5 's eye in the sky from his aerial platform , @entity5 was able to photograph this amazing sand castle art which was hidden behind a tall fence from the air , @entity5 had almost unlimited visibility on this warm summer day where thousands of @entity4 decide to decamp for a bit here the opposing colours look almost like some form of ancient board game while the sand appears to have a leather - like consistency the angle of this photograph is so acute it is difficult to decide whether the image is the correct way up , adding to its interest in this first photograph , the sun bathers seem less interested in having their own umbrella compared to the people in the right hand photograph along this section of beach many of people have turned their loungers away from the water and as the shadows show , towards the sun for that all important even tan			1

@entity6 photographer @entity5 flew along the @entity3 coast in @entity4 to capture these amazing images
the coastline , which is *popular* with holiday makers , is *crowded* with sun loungers and beach umbrellas
from the air , the colours and patterns on the ground can create a *dizzying* *effect* in the colourful images
