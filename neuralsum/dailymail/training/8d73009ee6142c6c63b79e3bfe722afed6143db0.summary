the thing that struck me most , when my daughter started secondary school in september , is how different all the girls in her year look			2
all shapes and sizes , from teeny - tiny waifs who look like they ’re barely out of reception , to big strapping ones , taller than me , and with all the accessories to match			1
or , as my daughter herself put it with great excitement : “ @entity17 , some of them have got even bigger boobs than you ! ” tall , short , stocky , skinny , sporty or speccie , they are all special in their own way			2
all starting out on life ’s long journey ; no longer children but not yet women			2
and still , for the most part , mercifully unaware that their appearance matters much			2
sure , they might admire someone ’s pretty hair , or blue eyes , or cheek dimples ; but that nasty little worm of self - doubt that afflicts so many older girls and women has yet to burrow its way into their hearts and minds			1
i do n’t have women ’s magazines in the house , and i do my best to suppress my own deep - rooted feelings of negativity about my own shape and size , and to promote a positive attitude towards healthy eating and exercise			1
but i know , deep down , that i ’m fighting a losing battle			2
because whatever good i may be able to do , the body fascists will always find a way of undoing it — whether through pop music , fashion or the media			0
the latest example of this comes from @entity44 lingerie brand @entity43 , currently intent on a @entity72 invasion			1
ten super-skinny models in push - up bra and pants pout , simper , giggle and hair - twirl their way across a billboard by way of promoting @entity43 ’s new so - called ‘ perfect body ’ range			1
and there ’s no mistaking what they mean by ‘ perfect ’ : perky of bosom , tiny of tummy and negligible of behind — with a thigh gap wide enough to park a bicycle in			1
as if that were n’t enough , the girls appear to have been stretched even thinner with a little help from that digital miracle device mr @entity94			1
one of them , a dark - haired girl in a purple set , appears to have the proportions of a @entity100 doll , which , as we all know , is anatomically unfeasible			1
all have visible ribcages and wrists like sparrows			0
of course , no one expects a brand like @entity43 to advertise its wares on ordinary women			1
but there is a line between aspiration and thinspiration , and this campaign clearly oversteps the mark			0
as for their use of the word ‘ perfect ’ , it ’s not only offensive to the 99.9 per cent of the female population who do n’t share the models ’ ‘ perfect ’ proportions , it ’s also deeply irresponsible , if not downright cruel			1
especially given the brand ’s target market			2
which is obviously not me			0
or indeed anyone over the age of 22 or bigger than a size 6			0
only the other day i saw a gaggle of 14 and 15 - year - olds scuttling out of @entity43 in @entity135 ’s @entity134 shopping centre , laden down with garish bags presumably containing various items of microscopic and sexually precocious underwear			1
when i was their age , my mum was still buying my pants , and rightly so			0
@entity147 , then , for the three @entity72 students who are demanding that the company — which is the largest @entity44 lingerie retailer — apologise , and alter the wording on the advertisement			1
like other overtly body - conscious brands of this ilk — from @entity152 , with its adverts awash in demeaning pornographic imagery , to @entity155 , which imagines all girls as salty - haired surf sirens — they ’re aiming squarely at all our daughters			2
young women who are picked to model for @entity43 , including @entity161 ( left ) and @entity162 ( right ) - who claims she only consumes liquid protein nine days before a show - are nicknamed ' @entity166 ' that ’s right : those same happy girls who start off being all shapes and sizes , unaware that there is any aspect of themselves that is wrong , and who end up hating their bodies half to death			1
who look upon the likes of @entity179 and @entity162 and all the other so - called ‘ @entity166 ’ ( young women picked to model for @entity43 are nicknamed @entity166 ) and find themselves so lacking in the fundamental virtue of extreme thinness that they lose all sense of reason and proportion			1
this advert — and all the others like it — is not just harmless titillation			2
it ’s a deliberate projection of an ideal of female beauty so narrow as to be virtually unattainable			0
it is also deeply damaging			0
and that is exactly how @entity43 and their buddies like it			1
because what these companies are really peddling is not underwear ; it ’s a lifetime of body insecurities			0
that ’s how they maintain demand and ensure that consumers keep coming back for more			0
treat them mean , keep them keen			0
because , let ’s face it , if all the women in the world suddenly woke up tomorrow miraculously happy and comfortable in their own skins , what need would there be for push - up bras ? female self - loathing is the commercial cornerstone of the fashion and beauty industry			1
every woman who looks in a mirror and hates what she sees is a potential customer , lured by the prospect of finding the ‘ perfect ’ answer to her imperfect appearance			1
when a woman declares she has nothing to wear , what she really means is : ‘ i hate myself for not being thin / pretty / young / busty enough ’			1
successful commerce is all about profit margins			0
so if you ’re @entity43 and you make cheap , rather nasty mass - produced underwear that normal women would n’t dream of buying because it fits so badly and makes you itch , it ’s in your clear financial interest to detract as much attention away from the actual product as you can , and to sell an image instead			1
you put on super-glamorous fashion shows , hype up your models , hire pop stars , build a buzz			2
you get every hot - blooded male lusting after your ‘ @entity166 ’ and every impressionable young girl wanting to be one			1
you ruthlessly exploit every weakness of the naive young female mind — and then you sit back and watch the cash roll in			0
of course , when you ’re old and wise and a bit grumpy , like me , you can see through these shameless tactics and make your buying choices accordingly			0
but when you ’re young and naive and inexperienced , and all you want to do is please others and be accepted by your peer group , it ’s so much harder to be rational			0
shoppers are pictured at the @entity259 on new @entity260 , central @entity135 , which attracts teenagers in droves when you see ten girls in bikinis like this , you do n’t think : ‘ my goodness , they look like they could use a bowl of beef soup and a buttered bun			1
’ you think : ‘ if only i looked like that , all my problems would be solved			1
’ no matter that to get this way , these models , the @entity275 and @entity276 of this world , have to spend weeks on end eating nothing but shredded kale and protein shakes			1
or that they have to give interviews in which they gush about the joys of juicing and ‘ drinking lots of warm water in the mornings ’			1
‘ @entity298 ’ @entity162 , for example , claims she consumes only liquid protein for nine days before a show — and then stops drinking completely 12 hours beforehand , because , as she enthusiastically explains ‘ sometimes you can lose up to 8lb just from that ! ’ great ! young girls do n’t read things like that and think : ‘ she ’s clearly mad			2
’ they think : “ oh , excellent			2
if i do that , i too can be a supermodel			0
” except they almost certainly ca n’t			0
no one can lead a halfway normal existence existing on nothing but warm water and protein shakes			0
certainly not teenage girls , whose bodies are still developing and need a sensible , nutritious diet			0
and even if they did , there ’s no guarantee they ’d end up a size 000 , in their underwear on a billboard			2
i know , because when i was young i tried very , very hard to be super-thin			0
but even at my thinnest , i could never make the grade because i ’m simply not built like that			0
i have huge hands , even bigger feet — and a pair of shoulders like an ox			0
the fact is these girls — these so - called ‘ perfect ’ girls that @entity43 are encouraging women to emulate — are not normal			1
it ’s not just that they lead obsessive , narcissistic lifestyles , in which the only thing that matters is the way their bottom looks in a thong			0
it ’s also that they belong to a species all of their own			0
the difference between these girls and your average female is the difference between a solid little @entity348 pit - pony and the winner of the @entity350 ; or a sausage dog and a whippet			2
same species , worlds apart			0
nothing wrong with either , of course			0
what ’s wrong is the relentless and totally demoralising message that one is ‘ perfect ’ — and the other not .			1
