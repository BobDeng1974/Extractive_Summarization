a familiar face from the past returned to @entity2 yesterday to catch up with old friends and to pick up a @entity5 trophy he won back in 2001 - 02			1
but despite the 12 - year absence , it was almost as if @entity9 had never been away			1
as had been the case when he first arrived as a player at @entity12 in october 2001 , @entity9 was blown away by a welcome as warm as the unseasonably hot sun that beat down over @entity15			1
while he was being shown around by @entity12 director of football operations @entity16 , up popped long - serving groundsman @entity17 whom @entity18 immediately greeted like an old friend , before joking that his grass was far better now than back in the day			1
@entity9 shot to fame when he repeatedly kicked an advertising board after scoring for @entity23 he played 78 times for @entity23 , pictured after scoring against @entity25 at @entity26 @entity9 would make it clear , though , that the way he was treated by people like @entity17 made it feel like the @entity31 ’ pitch was the place where he played his best football in the @entity34			1
that included his spells at @entity37 , and , most notably , as a gifted but cantankerous midfielder at @entity23 where he shot to fame by angrily kicking an advertising board after scoring a late winner against @entity42 in 1998			1
and yet , while @entity9 revelled in the familiarity of it all , he admitted that his return as manager of the @entity48 national team for saturday ’s crucial @entity50 qualifier has made him see how @entity52 football is a completely alien environment to the one he left behind all those years ago			1
all it took was a glance at the @entity57 league table			2
the 46 - year - old already knew that @entity59 and @entity60 were out of the top flight due to financial mismanagement while @entity63 had joined them in the @entity64 due to rank incompetency			2
but to see it there in black and white that the once - mighty @entity69 , struggling so badly under @entity68 , were sitting in a previously unthinkable sixth - place in the table merely under - scored the old line that the past is indeed a foreign country			2
@entity9 has been manager of the @entity48 national team since 2009 in @entity9 ’s mind , however , @entity52 ’s football ’s well - publicised problems should be seen as an opportunity for clubs like his beloved @entity12			1
he feels that , in 2014 , the opportunity is there for provincial sides to win the @entity52 title ; an ambition which proved far beyond @entity12 even in the days when he earned £ 10,000 - per - week there and starred alongside gifted talents including @entity88 , @entity89 and his @entity48 international teammate @entity90			1
‘ @entity52 football is now very different , ’ nodded @entity9 ahead of his showdown with @entity93 ’s men at @entity94 on saturday			1
‘ we were just talking about this earlier			0
the best clubs in @entity98 - @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity63 - they are all now in the second tier			1
‘ and @entity69 are not doing very well either			0
they did not qualify for the @entity100 , and they are not doing very well in the league			0
‘ usually by now they are already saying @entity69 are the champions of @entity98			2
but , right now , they are six points behind the leaders ( @entity104 )			0
his @entity48 side face a tough test against @entity98 when the two sides meet on saturday evening ‘ so i think maybe it is time for the other teams in @entity98 to challenge for the championship			1
there is not big money available in @entity98 any more , even at @entity59 and @entity69 , so everything is possible			2
‘ do i really believe another team outwith @entity69 can win the title ? yes , that is what i am saying			0
it is not the same @entity69 as before			0
they have shown they are not unbeatable			0
’ for @entity9 , a swift saunter across the @entity2 turf doubled as a walk down memory lane			2
albeit to a season when @entity12 , for all the spending that would eventually see them end up in administration , finished an unimpressive ninth in the @entity52 top flight			1
‘ i really enjoyed my football at @entity12 , ’ he smiles afterwards			2
‘ i played in @entity34 for five years , and the best i ever played was here			2
it was because i knew i was an important player for the club and i did n’t have the pressure of having to be the best every week to play the next game			2
‘ that really helped me to play my best football			2
i scored six goals and i really enjoyed it			0
while managing @entity140 in 2008 , @entity9 came up against @entity142 's @entity141 ‘ i was sad that i did not stay for the next year but unfortunately i got injured playing with the national team and it was difficult for me with my knee to come back and play here			1
‘ but it ’s nice to be back and to see where i used to play			0
it ’s nice to see them doing well , too			0
‘ i think , for @entity12 , they need to stay in the @entity57 and it wo n’t be a problem			1
after that , you build slowly			0
you can not build a new team in one year – not unless you spend millions of pounds , like in the past			0
‘ i wish to see this club continue to grow slowly and hopefully to one day win some trophies			0
’ @entity9 is no longer in touch with his former @entity12 manager , the @entity159 @entity158			1
but he asked after old friends like @entity161 , the club captain who now manages @entity64 side @entity163			0
he also will never forget @entity164 , the striker who is now manager of junior side @entity165			0
as @entity166 collected a specially - made trophy from @entity12 to mark his @entity5 award 12 years ago , he recalled how @entity164 preventing him from winning a clean sweep in 2002			1
‘ we went to the different supporters ’ club ’s @entity5 dinners , ” he recalled			2
@entity9 battles with @entity175 's @entity174 in a @entity57 clash in the 1997/98 season ‘ i missed out on only one @entity5 award			1
i got them all except one ! @entity164 , the forward , got the other one			0
you see , i lost only one and even now i still remember who got it ! ‘ it ’s good to know @entity164 is still in football and so , too , is @entity161 , our captain			0
he was a good character and also a very nice guy in the team , on the pitch , and outside the pitch			0
i wish him all the best			0
‘ it ’s good that people from my old team continue to be in football			0
unfortunately , there are so many people involved in football now who have no idea and it is destroying the game			0
it ’s better to have men who have been in football and understand football running things than people who want control just because they have money			0
’ next up on @entity9 ’s nostalgic tour of @entity98 will be @entity94 on saturday as his @entity214 seek to inflict some serious damage on @entity98 ’s bid to reach @entity217			1
his only appearances there as a player saw @entity12 lose 2 - 1 in february 2002 and @entity221 side @entity140 defeated 2 - 0 in a @entity100 qualifier in 2005			1
‘ @entity94 is a good stadium with a nice crowd and it will be a good atmosphere to play football in , ’ he said			2
‘ will i be kicking any advertising boards if we win ( like at @entity23 ) ? no , i only kicked them as a player			1
but if anyone thinks it ’s going to be easy against us , it ’s not			0
’ just because @entity9 is an avowed fan of @entity52 football wo n’t stop the @entity214 trying to add to our woes .			1

@entity9 played for @entity12 between 2001 and 2002 , where he won @entity5 despite only making 22 appearances
@entity9 admits a *lot* has *changed* since he left @entity52 football 12 years ago , and *suggests* someone different could challenge for the @entity57
he is now managing his country - @entity48 - who play against @entity98 in a @entity217 qualifier on saturday
@entity9 is perhaps most famous for his *celebration* while playing for @entity23 , when he kicked out at an advertising hoarding
