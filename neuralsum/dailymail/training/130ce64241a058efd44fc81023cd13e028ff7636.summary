@entity5 has been granted a licence in a move that drew condemnation last night from road safety and alcohol awareness campaigners			1
they say the proposal is ' a backwards step ' that sends out ' completely the wrong message ' about drinking and driving			0
the branch of @entity5 is planned for the main building at @entity20 service station on the @entity21 @entity5 plans to open the pub at the @entity24 service area on the @entity21 near junction two at @entity20 , @entity26 , later this year – with more to follow at other @entity24 sites			1
the pub chain said bar staff will trust customers to know whether they should be drinking or not and does not plan to quiz people asking for a pint of beer or glass of wine			1
it follows a move by the @entity38 to relax the law that bans the sale of alcohol at motorway service stations			0
as a result , a growing number now sell drink through retail partners such as @entity47			2
and two weeks ago , @entity48 opened its first motorway restaurant – selling alcohol – at @entity52 on the @entity53 at @entity54 in @entity55			2
it is part of a six - month trial but more harvesters are expected to open at other @entity60 sites			1
alcohol concern chief executive @entity62 warned : ' selling alcohol on our motorways sends all the wrong signals to drivers , it just sounds like profits being put before sense			0
wetherspoon : has been given permission for a £ 2million licensed bar and restaurant on the @entity21 at @entity20 , @entity26 ' campaigners have worked tirelessly to improve road safety in the @entity3 and persuade people that drinking and driving do n't mix and this feels like a backwards step			1
' @entity81 , the founder of @entity82 , said : ' i 'm absolutely astounded they have got permission for this			0
' people will be tempted to drink and drive and i ca n't understand how the local authority has allowed this			1
it is just not necessary – you can buy alcohol on every street corner so why tempt people by having it at motorways as well ? sir @entity97 , chairman of the @entity98 , said : ' to reduce alcohol - related harm , we have to reduce its availability , not increase it			2
opening a bar at a service station sends out completely the wrong message if we are trying to prevent harm from alcohol - related traffic accidents			1
' drink - driving resulted in 9,990 casualties , including 280 deaths , on @entity3 roads in 2011 , with 42 per cent of all road deaths linked to drinking			1
but @entity5 insists that neither @entity113 nor @entity115 district council raised any objection to its licence application for the first fully - fledged pub to be opened specifically to serve motorway traffic			1
the conservative - run council said the licence was granted last week following the statutory 28 - day public consultation during which no objections were lodged			0
it insisted the @entity21 site is not directly on the motorway – drivers have to take a slip road to reach it			2
@entity5 and @entity24 are investing more than £ 2million on the @entity21 development , which will create 50 jobs			1
it will open 24 hours a day for food , coffee and soft drinks , and serve alcohol from 8am to 1am			2
@entity5 chairman @entity5 said : ' the company has always been innovative and this is an exciting new development for us			2
hopefully it will be the first of many			0
' asked about the risk that it will encourage people to drink - drive , a @entity5 spokesman said : ' we think the majority of people who want a drink will be coach parties with a driver who is not drinking			1
' if an individual comes in and orders a whisky or pint of beer , we are not going to ask whether they are driving			0
you would n't do that in a village pub and we wo n't be doing that here			0
we expect people to act responsibility			0
we do n't see this as any different to a pub that you may drive to that is just off the motorway network			2
' extra chief executive @entity167 said the motorway pub would ' improve customer choice '			0
until recently , the sale of alcohol at motorway service station outlets was banned			0
however , this has been relaxed over the past 18 months			0
a proposal to remove controls has been outlined by the @entity38 in its alcohol strategy , which is designed to reduce the red tape surrounding drink licensing .			0

@entity5 given go - ahead for £ 2 million bar and restaurant
24 - hour pub will open on the @entity21 at @entity20 , @entity26
