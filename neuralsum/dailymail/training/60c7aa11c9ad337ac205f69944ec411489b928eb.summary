the man struck by media owner @entity3 could have suffered a life - threatening injury if it were not for his ' physical shape and paratrooper training ' , a @entity1 court heard today			1
@entity7 , 40 , claimed that the newspaper baron ' hit me with his fist three times in my head ' in testimony that the judge must consider in deciding whether to jail the tycoon for up to five years for ' hooliganism motivated by political hatred '			1
the notorious incident came in a tv talk show in 2011 after which the former @entity21 spy - who bought the @entity23 titles and @entity24 - claimed he acted in self - defence fearing he was about to be hit			2
@entity1 media magnate @entity3 , pictured left arriving at a court in @entity29 , is on trial for allegedly punching businessman @entity7 , pictured right , because of political hatred show : mr @entity3 ( left ) lashed out at @entity7 during a @entity1 tv debate in 2011 @entity7 alleged that 53 - year - old @entity3 - an @entity33 spy once based in @entity35 - used ' specialised training and martial arts skills ' during the sudden attack			1
but there was also farce at the @entity29 trial yesterday as the judge permitted property magnate @entity7 's absence from the trial based on the fact he is on bail in @entity46 and barred from leaving that country amid allegations he assaulted a group of sailors and held them captive using a knife			1
however , there is growing evidence that he absented himself from @entity46 around two months ago , and that he is now in @entity56 , possibly in the area of @entity58 , having earlier spent time in @entity60 and @entity61			0
as judge @entity62 ruled that @entity7 could not get out of @entity46 for ' extraordinary circumstances ' , he tweeted a picture this week showing him smiling and sitting in a wooden bath , possibly in a sauna , captioned ' @entity68 people '			2
another shows him riding a bike			0
a reliable source independent of @entity3 has told @entity72 that he is in @entity56 as @entity3 's lawyers argued that his rights were flouted if he could not challenge his accuser in court			1
@entity3 told the judge yesterday : ' i can provide information on where @entity7 is in several days , your honour			1
' excuse : mr @entity7 is said to be unable to attend the trial as he is stuck in @entity46 viral : footage of the punch , when @entity7 fell backwards and was knocked off his chair , went viral despite this , the claim by @entity7 to have been hit three times by @entity3 may be significant in convicting him			2
analysts fear a behind the scene campaign by the @entity92 for his foes to lock him up after his @entity1 newspaper @entity94 carried a series of anti-corruption campaigns			0
under @entity1 law , three - as distinct from two - punches could be a key factor in permitting the judge to hand down a long sentence			0
' because of the sudden @entity3 attack and strong punches i sustained , i fell off with a chair behind the podium , ' said @entity7 in written testimony soon after the event			2
' fortunately , thanks to my physical shape and paratrooper training , i managed to avoid major injury			0
' he could easily have hit his head on metal objects in the studio , and but for his training he could have suffered ' life and health threatening injuries '			0
' @entity3 's punches were purposefully to a sensitive part of the head , the temples , and these punches could have had unpredictable consequences , taking into consideration my dangerous fall with my head down , ' he added			1
screen clash : @entity1 banker and media magnate @entity3 ( pictured ) argues that the incident involving @entity7 was not politically motivated experienced : mr @entity7 claims he did not suffer serious injury ' thanks to my physical shape and training ' in the event , @entity7 was knocked off his chair , and suffered some bruises and torn trousers but was relatively unscathed			1
while @entity7 's statement accuses @entity3 of ' hooliganism ' he does not appear to claim any political motivation in the attack , yet this is specifically what the @entity1 state alleges that he committed			1
he did , however , call him ' an mp who resorted to hooliganism '			0
@entity3 is no longer a national politician but is a deputy in a regional parliament in @entity1			0
@entity7 quoted @entity3 after the incident saying he had ' neutralised ' him			2
@entity7 said he did not hit back			0
' i did not succumb to provocations , and did n't cross the line			0
' @entity156 , @entity3 's lawyer , criticised the failure to insist on @entity7 appearing at the trial			1
this amounted to ' depriving mr @entity3 from the right to properly protect himself			0
' the trial resumes on friday when the media tycoon is expected to call his witnesses			2

media tycoon @entity3 faces up to five years in jail if judge finds he punched businessman @entity7 because of ' political hatred '
@entity92 accused of wanting @entity3 jailed over newspaper *investigations*
@entity3 's family own independent titles and the @entity24
