by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 16 march 2014 updated : 10:47 est , 16 march 2014 as it passes through a clear night sky , you might be forgiven for thinking that the slow moving small white light was a low aircraft			2
however , you could not be more wrong			2
that gliding pinprick , if you are lucky enough to see it , is in fact the 450 tonnes that makes up the @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , and it is constantly hurtling through space at some 17,500 miles per hour , at an altitude of some 250 miles			1
because the @entity11 has been orbiting above the heads of us mere earthlings for some 16 years , it has become all too easy to become rather blasé about it , and to think of it as no more remarkable than , say , a normal weather satellite			1
@entity22 astronaut major @entity21 is one of the stars of a two - and - a - half - hour pioneering live broadcast from the @entity11 and @entity25 in @entity26 on sunday on @entity27 however , with the showing of @entity30 , a fascinating mini-season of programmes on @entity27 , it is high time that we stopped taking this incredible spacecraft for granted			1
on sunday night , the season culminates in a two - and - a - half - hour pioneering live broadcast from the @entity11 and @entity25 in @entity26 , during which viewers will be able to watch the astronauts onboard the space station as they travel around the world in 90 minutes			1
in addition , the astronauts will share their breathtaking views of planet earth , and they will explain what exactly they get up to all day in their celestial home and office			2
helping to make sense of what we will be seeing is @entity22 ’s first ever astronaut , major @entity21 , 41 , a former army helicopter pilot who is due to visit the @entity11 for a 6 - month mission next year			1
understandably , @entity21 always keeps a look out for the space station when it passes above him			2
‘ i always get excited when i see the @entity11 , ’ he admits , ‘ and i even have an app on my phone which gives me an alarm whenever it is getting close ! of course , it ’s a bit different when you ’re going up there yourself			1
’ the @entity10 ( @entity11 ) is constantly hurtling through space at some 17,500 miles per hour , at an altitude of some 250 miles @entity21 explains what life will be like for him when he does get there			1
‘ the daily working routine is punishing , ’ he says			2
‘ much of the time , we will performing scientific experiments , and then clearing them up			2
’ one question @entity21 is often asked is whether the @entity11 is claustrophobic			1
‘ i ’ve never heard anybody describe it as cramped ! ’ he says			2
‘ it ’s the size of a @entity75 , and there are only six of us on board , so there is plenty of room			0
in fact , it quite usual to spend a whole day in one of the modules on your own and not see another person			0
’ naturally , @entity21 and his fellow astronauts have to train immensely hard			0
as well as having to become proficient scientists , they also have to learn to dock manually visiting vehicles with the @entity11 , go on space walks , and - perhaps most challenging of all - to deal with each other			1
‘ managing relationships is one of the most important parts of our training , ’ says @entity94 ‘ you just have to get on well			0
crews consist of people from different countries and cultures , and we all have to be aware of that			0
’ as well as having to become proficient scientists , the astronauts also have to learn to dock manually visiting vehicles with the @entity11 , go on space walks , and - perhaps most challenging of all - to deal with each other one of the most intense periods of training is when the astronauts are taken to a cave in @entity111 , where they spend a week working together on problems and tasks			1
‘ it ’s funny to think that an underground cave is a good analogue for space , ’ says @entity21 , ‘ but it really is			0
physically , it ’s a tough environment , we have to change clothes a lot , take photographs , and take lots of scientific samples			0
and all the time , we have to work on our leadership and followership skills			0
’ during @entity21 ’s six - month mission , he will have very little downtime , but when he does , like many of the astronauts , he might head to a 7 - window cupola from where the crew can gaze down on the planet they call home			2
‘ although the cupola is meant to be a place that is used for observing @entity138 and controlling robotic arms , ’ says @entity21 , ‘ i know that many use the cupola simply to take in the amazing view			0
’ and it ’s that view that we will all be able to enjoy on sunday night when @entity27 links up to the @entity11 for what promises to be literally an out - of - this - world programme			1
the man behind the show is tv producer @entity148 , who has long been fascinated by space			0
‘ i had always wanted to do something about space , ’ he says , ‘ but the challenge was always finding the right way to tell the story			0
’ ‘ the eureka moment finally came when it occurred to me that the @entity11 takes 90 minutes to orbit the @entity138 – that makes a perfect length for a tv programme			1
’ the full programme will in fact last two - and - a - half hours			1
the most powerful element will undoubtedly be the breathtaking views of the globe , which will be filmed by three high - definition cameras that are attached to the exterior of the @entity11 ‘ of course , we wo n’t be able to control the weather , ’ says @entity148 , ‘ but there ’s no doubt that come what way , there will be some amazing views			1
’ the astronauts will share their breathtaking views of planet earth , and they will explain what exactly they get up to all day in their celestial home and office one of the most spectacular phenomena will be witnessing the fall of night across the globe			0
‘ it will be the most extraordinary sight , ’ says @entity148			0
‘ we will be able to watch this line of night creeping across the globe			0
it will be absolutely spectacular			0
’ unfortunately , viewers will not be able to see planets and stars , as the rapid movement of the @entity11 makes it very difficult for cameras to focus on such distant objects			1
like all live tv , the programme will have its technical challenges , and there will be plenty of opportunity for things not to go according to plan			2
‘ sometimes @entity201 lose the signal from the @entity11 for 20 to 30 minutes , ’ says @entity148			1
‘ if that happens , then we just have to deal with it			0
but i think that ’s going to be part of the fun of the show ! ’ also helping to talk viewers through the journey around the earth will be professor @entity212 , who will help to provide some philosophical ballast to the show			0
‘ one of the big questions we have to answer is , “ why do we have a space station up there ? ” ’ , says @entity148			0
‘ although lots of vital experiments are carried out into researching cancer , and to examining the behaviour of compounds and plants , we also have to look at the context of the @entity11 in regards to the future of the human race			1
’ for many , the astronauts up in the @entity11 are the @entity230 of their day			1
they are starting to explore a place where , one day , mankind may have to inhabit			0
the @entity138 is finite , and if man wants to continue , he will have to make his home elsewhere			0
the @entity11 is therefore just a very small step for man			1
live from @entity237 : lap of the @entity238 airs at 7.30pm , sunday , @entity27 the route of the @entity11 would make @entity241 green with envy - and perhaps with more than a little motion sickness			1
travelling at 17,500 miles per hour , the @entity11 can go around the word 16 times per day - that ’s once every ninety minutes.on sunday night , @entity27 will make contact with the space station as it passes over @entity247 while @entity248 are enjoying a mid morning coffee			1
the @entity11 will then proceed down the west coast of the @entity251 and @entity252			1
in @entity254 , we shall hopefully see mountains and jungle as it passes over the north of the @entity258 , and cuts across the south of @entity261 is followed by a long haul over the @entity263 , before it makes landfall again around @entity265			0
if we are in luck , we might be able to see the @entity267 , as well as violent thunderstorms over southern @entity11 then heads in a north - easterly direction , and crosses the @entity270			1
it will be night when it approaches @entity271 and @entity272 , and if the smog has lifted , we should be able to see the lights of beijing.the last land we spot will be part of @entity277 , after which the @entity11 rockets over the @entity279 , to once more fly over the west coast of the @entity251 – by which time @entity248 will be sitting down for lunch			1
at 109 metres long , the @entity11 is the same length as a full size football pitch			2
the electrical power system consists of eight miles of cable			0
it took 115 space flights to construct the @entity11 it only takes 6 hours to travel to the @entity287			2
the flight backs takes 12 hours , during which the astronauts can experience 8 g of pressure			0
the computers on the @entity11 contain 2 million lines of software code , which is supported by another 3.3 million lines back on @entity138			2
last july , an astronaut nearly drowned during a spacewalk because debris clogged a waterpipe and it flooded into his spacesuit .			0

season culminates in two - and - a - half - hour pioneering live broadcast from the @entity11 and @entity25 in @entity26 on sunday on @entity27
