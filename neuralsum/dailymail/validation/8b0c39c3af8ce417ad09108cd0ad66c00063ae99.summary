@entity0 sprinted to victory as he claimed gold in the second round of the @entity4 in @entity5 on sunday			1
the 24 - year - old @entity7 bronze medallist maintained a challenging position throughout the race after coming home fifth following a disappointing opening race in @entity12 earlier this month			2
but , in @entity13 , @entity0 burst out of the second transition and established an immediate lead over world champion @entity16 of @entity17 and @entity19 @entity18 , while current world number one @entity20 of @entity17 was a minute down by this stage			1
@entity0 sprinted to victory as he claimed gold in the second round of the @entity4 though the final stages of the 10 - kilometre run brought with them heavy rain , @entity0 reached the final corner clear of his rivals and celebrated along with the crowd over the final few metres before crossing the line in a sprint finish with a time of one hour 55 minutes and 26 seconds ahead of @entity16 and third - placed @entity35			1
@entity0 's brother @entity36 missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but , with @entity7 qualification to be decided in august and september at the test event in @entity41 and the world series @entity43 in @entity44 , none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon			1
@entity47 is hopeful of a return in time for the fourth round in @entity50 late next month			2
@entity51 was visibly delighted with victory and said : ' in ( the previous round in ) @entity12 i made many mistakes , and i 've been beating myself up about it for the last few weeks			2
i 've been training hard because i did n't want to do that again , and i wanted to be able to show how good i was			0
' i really enjoyed it , i felt good and i 'm pleased to win			0

@entity77 's @entity71 came home in a time of 2:14.10 but fellow @entity81 @entity80 suffered a mechanical issue during the bike ride and was forced to withdraw from the race .			0
