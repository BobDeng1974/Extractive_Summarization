by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:46 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:46 est , 18 december 2013 it would be the perfect festive treat for those looking to keep the weight off – low - fat chocolate			1
and scientists claim to have found a way to make it happen			2
the have come up with ‘ choco - lite , which contains microscopic bubbles of a jelly made from seaweed that bulk out the chocolate			1
scientists at @entity17 claim they have found a way to make tasty low - fat chocolate using agar bubbles the agar bubbles are also high in fibre , a natural appetite suppressant			1
previous attempts to reduce the fat content of chocolate – usually about 30 per cent – while retaining the taste and texture have failed			1
for instance , tiny air bubbles leave chocolate feeling too light , while water bubbles take away the crispness of the snapping sound and risk a white bloom forming on the bar			2
so dr @entity36 , of @entity17 , turned to agar , which is already used in the cosmetics industry			1
heated in the right way , it solidifies at the same temperature as chocolate			0
the bubbles are so small that the mouth can not distinguish them from fat			2
@entity47 , of @entity48 , told @entity50 magazine : ‘ fat replacer is something the food industry is very keen to have			0
’ the microscopic agar bubbles are high in fibre and therefore more filling than the fat in normal chocolate @entity59 is 80 per cent fibre , meaning it ’s a lot more filling than normal chocolate			1
as for how it tastes , according to this week ’s @entity50 , that is ‘ pretty darned good ’			0
dr @entity36 , who usually works on new recipes for paints and industrial coatings , has tried adding vodka to the mix. this ‘ did n’t taste particularly nice ’ but he is looking forward to trying out baileys and amaretto flavourings			0
industry experts welcomed the advance but questioned whether the public will embrace healthy chocolate			0
but @entity78 , of trade magazine @entity79 , said : ‘ this is very clever and it ’s dinner party chat but people don ’ t eat chocolate to be healthy			0

scientists at @entity17 used agar to create ' choco - lite '
the bubbles are high in fibre and replace the fat in chocolate
