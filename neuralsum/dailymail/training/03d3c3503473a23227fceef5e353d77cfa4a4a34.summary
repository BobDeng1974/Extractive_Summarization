the defect has has so far been linked to at least five deaths in the @entity7 and many more injuries			1
under pressure : @entity0 is expanding a recall of potentially lethal driver 's side airbags to all 50 @entity7 states @entity21 , 51 , of @entity22 was among those fatally wounded			1
she died in october after a minor crash in her 2001 @entity26 caused the airbag to deploy			2
police believed she 'd been the victim of a stabbing because of the severe nature of her injuries , according to her family 's lawsuit			1
but an autopsy revealed metal and plastic fragments from an exploding airbag caused her death			1
one incident from 2010 did n't involve a crash at all			2
instead , a lawsuit claims that @entity42 was stopped at a red light in her 2001 @entity44 when the airbag deployed			2
victim : a lawsuit alleges that @entity21 , 51 , of @entity22 was struck by plastic and metal shrapnel after a @entity9 airbag deployed in her 2001 @entity26 during a minor accident deadly : a metal component of the airbag that critically injured @entity21 is shown , as @entity54 deals with allegations that their airbags have caused numerous fatalities while the company covered up faulty parts metal fragments sliced into her neck , hitting her carotid artery , and @entity42 was only able to survive by placing two fingers into the wound to limit the bleeding			1
afterwards , the lawsuit alleges , she suffered strokes and was left with traumatic brain injury			2
@entity54 insists that current @entity0 recalls covering 8 million @entity7 cars in high - humidity areas - where moisture in the air can trigger an explosion - are sufficient			1
but the @entity74 wants the order expanded nationwide after some incidents outside the high - humidity zones			2
ready to pop : the inflators , made by @entity10 supplier @entity9 , can explode with too much force under certain conditions , sending deadly metal shrapnel into the passenger compartment @entity83 , @entity0 's executive vice president for @entity84 , told @entity86 lawmakers wednesday that @entity0 will expand the regional recall it began in june , but will continue to prioritize high - humidity areas			1
these spots include @entity90 , @entity91 , areas near the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 , as well as @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
@entity83 also said @entity0 is working with other air bag manufacturers to make sure it has enough parts			0
q : how can i find out if my car has been recalled ? a : dozens of models made by @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity0 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 dating to the 2001 model year are covered			1
you should have received a recall notice from your automaker			0
also , you can go to www.safercar.gov and key in your vehicle identification number , which normally is printed on your registration and stamped on the dashboard			0
that will tell you if your car is being recalled			0
you can also call your dealer			0
@entity0 is @entity54 's largest customer , and has so far recalled over 5 million vehicles in the @entity7 alone q : why are some of the recalls just in areas with high humidity ? a : government investigators and @entity54 officials believe that prolonged exposure to moisture in the air makes the inflator chemical , ammonium nitrate , burn too fast , creating too much pressure			1
that can cause the metal inflator canisters to shatter , spewing shrapnel into drivers and passengers			1
they 're still conducting tests on inflators replaced by dealers to figure out what level of humidity causes the problem			1
initially the recall areas were limited to @entity90 , @entity91 , areas near the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 , as well as @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
q : i live outside the recall areas , but the humidity is still high			0
is my car safe ? a : the short answer is no one is sure because the problem is still under investigation			0
this has some car owners confused and worried			0
investigators think they have found a concentration of defective inflators inside the high - humidity zone			1
but there are still a lot of humid locations outside those areas			0
@entity54 says the cars are safe if they 're outside the high - humidity area			0
it 's difficult to tell if your car has a @entity9 air bag inflator			1
you can try asking your dealer , but even they may not know			0
q : why does n't the government just order a national recall of all @entity54 air bag inflators ? a : safety regulators say two incidents outside of current recall zones involving driver 's side air bags are cause for a national recall			2
that could mean civil fines and a court date for @entity54			0
regulators can go to court to force @entity54 to do a recall , but they have to hold a public hearing first			2
q : what 's next ? a : other automakers are likely to follow @entity0 's lead in doing a national driver 's side recall			0
and the investigation will continue into passenger side problems			2
@entity54 could wind up being fined and face court action for defying the government 's demand for the national recall .			0
