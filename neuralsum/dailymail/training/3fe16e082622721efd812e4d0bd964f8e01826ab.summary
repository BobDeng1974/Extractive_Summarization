the woman , who also works in the medical profession , finally made the complaint to the @entity10 in 2009 after claiming @entity7 arrived at her workplace with the explicit photographs			1
@entity13 claims @entity7 threatened to disgrace her by showing the photographs of her nude and performing a sex act to her father in @entity4 and friends			1
it is against @entity39 law for women to have boyfriends and a sexual relationship is taboo in @entity4 and with devout @entity44 families who have strict rules on marriage			2
despite this @entity13 admitted to the panel that she and @entity7 did have a sexual relationship which continued even after she was allegedly ' brutally raped ' in 2001			2
under cross-examination @entity13 claimed she continued with a relationship with @entity7 because she ' was convinced that what he did was out of love '			2
the incident is thought to have happened at the @entity56 in @entity4 when @entity7 is said to have ' lured ' @entity13 with a promise to hand over some photos			1
defence counsel mr @entity59 refused to accept she had been raped and they instead confirmed their love for each other by swearing on the @entity64			0
allegations : the victim , who has not been named , told the medical watchdog panel in @entity23 ( pictured ) that over a nine - year period until 2009 @entity7 forced her to have sex and pose for explicit photographs he said : ' you regarded each other as husband and wife , did n’t you ? ' @entity13 denied that but admitted that their relationship continued for a further seven years afterward , during which the two regularly exchanged telephone calls and text messages			1
the panel were told that gifts , birthday cards and messages with elaborate ' i love you ' sentiments were swapped between them			0
but the relationship soured when @entity13 , who was dating and has since married another man , refused to rekindle their relationship once @entity7 arrived in the @entity88 in 2008			2
it is claimed that @entity7 then embarked on a campaign of blackmail because he was demanding that @entity13 should have his hand in marriage			2
the @entity10 is to ascertain whether he has acted improperly as a gp which carried a most severe penalty of being struck off			0
defence counsel mr @entity59 claimed @entity13 ’s accusations were a ' fantasy ' and she was trying to get ' revenge ' for going against her faith			0
mr @entity59 also accused her of lying for failing to admit that she and dr @entity7 had sex ' over a dozen times ' to the panel			1
she said : ' i have not been lying			0
this is a story over ten or 11 years			0
it ’s been very difficult			0
' mr @entity59 claimed that no photos of @entity7 exist and she never received any because she has not been able to produce them as evidence			2
she said : ' i was told to delete them which i did because it was very dangerous for me to have them on my home computer			0
' @entity7 is further accused of telephoning a friend of @entity13 and saying he had discussed kidnapping him in @entity4 but denies all the charges against him			1
the medical professional qualified at the @entity125 in 2004 but is not registered as a gp or a specialist in the @entity88			0
he is ' registered with a licence to practise ' , according to the @entity128			0
no criminal charges have been brought			0
