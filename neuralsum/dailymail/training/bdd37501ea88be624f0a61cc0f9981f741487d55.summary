by @entity0 dogs are almost four times better at detecting prostate cancer than traditional tests			1
medical detection dogs accurately detect the disease 90 per cent of the time , research has shown			1
in contrast , traditional @entity10 tests often give false positives – three in four positive results from the tests turn out to be false and result in unnecessary and invasive tests			1
the dogs are trained by the charity @entity17 , in @entity25			0
dr @entity26 , chief executive and director of operations at @entity17 , said : ‘ these results from the detection dogs are remarkable			1
‘ over the years , millions of pounds of @entity32 funding have been poured into the traditional test methods , and yet there has been little improvement in their reliability			0
‘ this has caused a huge waste of resources , not to mention the distress to the impacted individuals			0
‘ moreover , the detection dogs provide alternative solution that yields consistently accurate results			1
if our detection dogs were a machine , there would be huge demand for them			2
the dogs accurately pick up cancer cells in urine samples 90 per cent of the time ‘ dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts			1
their superior smelling power is well known			0
so why the reluctance to embrace this tested , time - old technology ? ’ as times goes by there is increasing interested about the work of @entity17			2
the charity has been invited to the @entity68 to showcase its work this evening			0
while they are there , the dogs will demonstrate their ability to detect cancer in urine samples			1
the @entity76 @entity75 and his wife @entity77 , a trustee of the charity , will also be attending to lend their support			0
@entity82 said : ‘ i am so pleased to see this government , and at last some people in the medical profession , are taking an interest in this life - changing work			2
some 75 per cent of positive @entity10 test results turn out , on further investigation , to be false ‘ we have long recognised the remarkable ability of dogs to assist the blind and deaf			1
now we are realising how much more they are capable of			0
‘ @entity17 ’s trained dogs can detect cancer before noticeable symptoms and others have been trained to recognise dangerously low sugar levels in diabetics			2
in short , this wonderful charity is training dogs to save lives			0
‘ @entity75 and i are trying to help the charity			0
we ’ve recently fostered one of the cancer detection dogs			1
we are both enjoying having @entity107 , a delightful little black spaniel , around the house ! ’ it has also previously been shown that dogs can detect other cancers , including bladder , ovarian and breast cancers .			0

medical detection dogs pick up the disease accurately 90 **%** of the time
traditional @entity10 tests often give false positives - 75 **%** of positives are false
the dogs can *sniff* out cancer cells in urine samples
