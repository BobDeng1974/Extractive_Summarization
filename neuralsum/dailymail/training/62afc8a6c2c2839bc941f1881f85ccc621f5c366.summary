by @entity0 published : 23:31 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 00:11 est , 3 october 2013 there 's sure to be a food fight over this one ... @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity3 has been named the ' @entity6 ' in the @entity7 meaning @entity8 is deemed to have the best slice in the country			1
hard as it is to believe , @entity13 's deep dish and @entity15 's thin and crispy were hardly in the running			2
@entity17 in @entity20 ’s @entity19 neighborhood came a close second having held the title for a number of years			1
tasty : @entity24 , the exclusive guide of restaurant reviews and nightlife ratings , has rated @entity28 , located on @entity29 in @entity5 , as having the top pizza in the country hungry ? the review guide included the input of thousands of customers in a point system in making their decision ' what an honor , ' said @entity41 , owner of @entity42			1
' we opened a little more than two years ago , and for the second year in a row , we have been named the @entity6 in @entity8 and we managed to top that by being named the @entity6 in the @entity7			1
' but give @entity15 some credit where it is due			2
mr @entity41 grew up there and after moving to @entity8 felt he needed to recreate a little bit of home on the @entity52			2
' @entity53 was born out of necessity			0
i wanted @entity57 pizza , not the take - out , cardboard variety we ’re accustomed to eating in the @entity7			1
' @entity28 claims he wanted pizza as it was meant to be			2
he wanted a pie with paper - thin crust , whose edges bubbled up into soft , crisp pockets of salty air , with sauce so flavorful it could stand as a topping all on its own and cheese so fresh it had to be made by hand each morning			0
transplant : the restaurant is owned by @entity41 who is originally from @entity15 but wanted a taste of the east coast out west new arrival : @entity77 has only been open for two years so their rise to the top has been meteoric it has taken many decades for @entity8 to be taken seriously when it comes to pizza			1
a number of restaurants have led the way including @entity87 , @entity88 , 800 degrees and @entity90 , but even these pizzerias are not in at the top of @entity24 's most recent surveys			1
the restaurant 's website states their raison d'etre : ' we know that pizza tastes best when it is wood - fired , that mozzarella should always be freshly made , and that meals are enhanced when paired with the perfect @entity102 wines			1
from our service to our atmosphere , our flour to our sauce , this is our tradition - passed down from generation to generation - of @entity111 - style pizza			2
at @entity4 , food is heritage			1
' @entity114 , a source for consumer - generated information , gave @entity53 , the only @entity8 pizzeria to make the list , a 27 out of 30 food rating			0
@entity28 's features hand - tossed dough , fresh sauces and herbs and homemade mozzarella			0
pizzas are cooked at 850 degrees in a wood - fired oven for 90 seconds , and then delivered whole , not sliced			0
there is a variety of pies on the menu but nothing too extreme			0
the anatra e provola is topped with duck confit , smoked mozzarella and caramelized onions			0
the caprino e carciofi is made with pesto , baby artichokes , fingerling potatoes , mozzarella and goat cheese			0
the vongole has @entity142 clams , corn and @entity145 pepperoncini			0
there are half a dozen ' white ' pizzas as well , topped with ingredients like ricotta , figs , squash blossoms and pistachios			0
@entity4 has three locations in @entity5 as well as one in @entity155 .			1

top pizza restaurant was chosen by reviews using @entity24 survey
@entity4 of @entity5 , @entity3 has only been open for two years
