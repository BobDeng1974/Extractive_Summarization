they have been billed as this year ’s @entity1 , the sporting event that will send a positive message about life beyond disability for servicemen and women wounded on the front line			1
but while the world awaits the lavish opening ceremony of the first @entity12 on wednesday , organiser @entity8 has spoken for the first time about how difficult it has been to put on the @entity16 - style event			1
in an hour - long documentary tomorrow night , he reveals that staging the @entity1 had been much harder than he had anticipated			1
‘ me and my big mouth , saying we ’re going to fill the @entity24 , we ’re going to do this , do that			2
‘ in my head it seemed very , very easy			2
in reality it ’s been a real struggle			2
’ the @entity1 will see more than 400 wounded , injured and sick servicemen and women compete across several sporting disciplines , including wheelchair rugby and athletics			1
thirteen nations , including @entity38 , will compete at the tournament , which takes place at some of the @entity43 and @entity44 venues			1
at the opening ceremony , @entity46 ’s @entity45 will perform the official games anthem and there will be a flypast by the @entity51			1
the star - studded closing ceremony on september 14 will see performances from acts including @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57			1
thousands of £ 12.85 tickets have been sold and some events are sold out			1
but the 29 - year - old prince remains nervous			1
prince @entity8 said : ‘ in my head it seemed very , very easy			1
in reality it ’s been a real struggle ' ‘ oh , of course i ’m nervous , ’ he said			2
‘ there are times when we thought that we ’re just never , ever going to get to the finish line			2
if all the venues sell out , then i ’m happy because it ’s all about the atmosphere and making these guys feel really special			2
' all they want to do is make sure they ’re fit enough and ready to put on a show for the public who have been constantly giving money to @entity80 and the other @entity81			2
people are coming because they want to show their appreciation , ’ @entity8 said			1
the @entity8 admitted the idea was ‘ stolen ’ from @entity86 ’s @entity85 , a similar event for injured @entity86 soldiers , now in its fourth year			1
however , he first considered the idea after his first tour of @entity38 in 2008			1
he recalled : ‘ i came back on a plane with three wounded guys all in induced comas			1
i think a @entity95 soldier died , so his coffin was underneath us			2
that for me was where it all started , ’ he said			2
the name ‘ @entity101 ’ – @entity102 for ‘ unconquered ’ – was inspired by @entity104 ’s classic poem of the same name , which tells of strength during times of adversity			2
countdown to the @entity12 , @entity109 , 9.15pm , sunday @entity110 has turned down the offer to compete at the event due partly to the ongoing conflict in the ravaged country			1
there is speculation that the war - torn country has decided not to send a team for fear that its athletes will be a target for those angered by the atrocities carried out in the region by @entity127 militants			1
but @entity128 , a spokesman for the @entity12 , insists this was not the case			1
she said : ‘ it has just not been possible for @entity110 to put together a team of competitors in the time available and with the other pressures currently on the military in @entity110			2
’ countries had five months to prepare teams after organisation for the @entity1 began in february			1
ms @entity140 added : ‘ @entity80 has been behind putting the @entity143 team together and has been so supportive			2
not every country invited to compete at @entity101 may have an organisation like that to help out			1
’ @entity110 will show support for the event by sending a small delegation of observers			2
organisers hope the country will take part in future events			1
my journey from battlefield to sports field : @entity160 captain on how he 's helping run the @entity12 after being shot by the @entity161 in 2009 @entity162 , 31 , served as a captain with the @entity164 in @entity110 and @entity38 , where he commanded a team of @entity143 soldiers embedded with @entity38 forces deep in central @entity171 ’s @entity170 - e @entity169 district			1
in 2009 he was shot by the @entity161 , suffering extensive chest wounds			0
he was medically discharged from the @entity160 last year and is now helping to run the @entity12 , as well as competing in them			1
it was the moment in which my life changed for ever			0
without warning , the quiet of the morning was shattered by the sound of automatic fire opening up on my patrol in @entity171			1
i did n’t know how many of them there were , so i inched forward to get a better fix on the situation			0
the first round was so close i felt it whistle past my head ; the second floored me			0
i had no time to react			0
it smashed into my shoulder like a sledgehammer , pulverising bone and tissue			0
it travelled through my chest , snapping my ribs like matchsticks and lacerating a lung			0
i was picked up by the force and flung several metres through the air , spinning like a rag doll			0
survival instinct kicked in , and i slithered into the ditch by the side of the road for cover			0
in the fetid water i began to gasp for breath			0
@entity208 , air and ditch water sucked in through the angry hole in my shoulder as i tried to inhale			0
@entity162 , 31 , is helping to run the @entity12 after being shot by the @entity161 in 2009 i knew my injuries were serious and that i needed to get to the hospital in @entity215			1
‘ and yea though i walk through the shadow of death , i shall fear no evil			0
’ my medic @entity220 ’s voice filled my ears			0
‘ damn , i am in the s * * * , ’ i thought			0
he ’s reciting the @entity224			0
’ the sounds of battle were becoming distant			0
‘ this is it ; this is how i end , ’ i told myself			0
instead , it was a beginning of sorts			0
after an operation at @entity215 , i was flown to @entity233			0
my battle back to health was slow			0
in july 2013 , dressed in my uniform for what would be one of the last times , i listened as doctors recommended that , on physical and psychological grounds , service in the @entity160 was unsuitable for me			0
my time in the @entity160 was over			0
i was expecting the decision , however , it still felt like someone had punched me in the stomach			0
over the preceding year there had been a fundamental shift in the way i viewed myself			0
i ’d only ever been in the @entity160 ; it was what defined me			0
but , post injury , i could only think of myself as something i used to be : an ex-soldier , wounded soldier , broken			1
now i have been honoured to play a role in running and taking part in the inaugural @entity12			1
these are men and women who have served and fought together			0
they bonded on the battlefield : now they ’ll bond on the sports field			1
the bullet remains embedded deep in my chest , and i will carry it with me for life			0
it is part of who i am and a permanent reminder of the fragility of life and how things can change in an instant			0
