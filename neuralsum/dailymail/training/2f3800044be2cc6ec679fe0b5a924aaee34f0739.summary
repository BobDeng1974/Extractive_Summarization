by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 22 april 2013 former @entity4 governor @entity3 released a full page ad in a local newspaper explaining why he was caught leaving his ex-wife 's house , the revelation of which started a domino effect for his congressional campaign			1
he did n't stop explaining his side of the story with the 1,200 - word ad either , as he included his real cell phone number in the ' personal message ' , encouraging voters to call him with questions			1
' i think that people always want to know the real story , the full story , ' he told @entity21 by phone			1
' context matters ' : former @entity4 governor @entity3 told @entity21 that he released a full page ad in order to get his side of the trespassing story out to the voters before the election the @entity31 former governor was the subject of an ethics investigation after he was caught returning to his home state after a trip to visit his mistress in @entity37 even though he told his staff he was hiking on the @entity39			1
the affair lead to his fall from grace , and eventual divorce from his wife @entity43			0
now the details of their divorce have come to light after she filed a lawsuit against him for a ' pattern ' of trespassing after he entered her @entity52 ’ @entity54 home without her permission in early february			1
last - ditch effort : @entity3 's campaign took out a lengthy ad in a local paper over the weekend as his poll numbers drop just two weeks before the election that lawsuit led to an explanation from @entity3 - who said he was watching the second half of the @entity65 with his 14 - year - old son while his ex was out of town - but that did n't stop the @entity70 from pulling their funding from the race			1
and that move came even before @entity43 confirmed that the first time that one of the couples ' sons met his @entity37 mistress - turned - fiancée was on stage at his primary victory party just weeks ago			0
when @entity21 spoke to mr @entity3 on monday , he said that he felt the need to take out the lengthy ad in @entity84 in order to make sure that the voters knew the whole story			1
' i think that context matters , ' he said			0
the first reports of the trespassing incident in question drew from the court documents that @entity95 's legal team filed , saying that he was seen leaving the back door of her @entity54 home using his cell phone as a flashlight			2
' that 's a rather spooky story - it would creep anybody out , ' he said			1
for that reason , he and his campaign staff felt the need to flesh it out more in print , in wordy detail			0
' i did , indeed , watch the second half of the @entity65 at the beach house with our 14 - year - old son because , as a father , i did n't think he should sit alone and watch it			1
given @entity43 was out of town , i tried to reach her beforehand to tell her of the situation that had arisen , and met her at the back steps and told her what had happened under the light of my cell phone when she returned , ' the ad reads			0
the 10 - paragraph ad goes on to talk about the influx of funding from @entity126 political action committees , backing his competitor @entity127			2
it also talks about his history of cutting government spending , even taking the unexpected route of bringing up his frugality when it came to his trips while serving as the state 's governor			0
awkward : @entity3 's son is visibly uncomfortable when he was standing next to his father 's mistress - turned - fiancee @entity137 , a woman he had met for the first time just moments before celebration : @entity3 leans in for a kiss with his fiancee following his win on tuesday night considering his ethics charges - of which he was cleared - surrounding the extramarital affair stemmed from the cost of his trips to meet his mistress , talking about other issues may have seemed like the more politically safe option			2
one thing he does not mention in the ad is the report that one of his son 's first meetings with his father 's mistress - turned - fiancée was onstage at his victory party for his primary win earlier this month			2
when asked if the public venue was really the first time that his son had met his future stepmother , he said : ' one of them had and one of them had n't '			0
' that 's the nature of a surprise - i did n't know she was coming , ' he said of his fiancée @entity137			0
the report of the awkward encounter made news when @entity95 confirmed it on wednesday			0
the trespassing revelation , family introduction at the victory party and the withdrawal of @entity70 funding all made for - as , @entity3 said in the ad , ‘ a rough week ’			1
and now a new poll shows that it has taken its toll			0
ex-couples court : former governor @entity3 ( left , now running for the state 's open congressional seat ) is accused of trespassing on his ex-wife 's property and she confirmed the victory party incident trespassing : @entity95 's lawyer filed court documents stating that her ex-husband @entity197 repeatedly entered her @entity54 home ( pictured ) without permission the @entity126 - leaning @entity200 released the latest numbers on monday saying that @entity3 was trailing mrs @entity127 by nine points , with the @entity203 winning 50 per cent to the @entity31 ’s 41 per cent			1
the poll was conducted between april 19 and 21 , two days after the wave of bad news hit the @entity3 campaign			2
' @entity127 is now looking like a clear favorite in the special election , ' the poll reads			0
' the only question is whether an extremely unpopular @entity3 can find some way to make voters like her even less than him in the next two weeks			0

@entity3 released a lengthy ad in a local newspaper explaining how he broke the rules of his divorce to watch the @entity65 with his son
his ex-wife filed a lawsuit calling it a ' pattern ' of trespassing
@entity226 led to the @entity70 to pull their funding for the race , and now he is 9 points down
the @entity31 spoke to @entity21 about his motivation behind the ad
said that *original* *version* of events sounded like a ' rather spooky story '
