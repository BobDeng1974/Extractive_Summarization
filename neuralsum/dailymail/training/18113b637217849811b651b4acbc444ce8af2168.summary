@entity1 , 55 , took a call from a man claiming to be a @entity5 security expert named ' @entity6 ' from @entity7 , who said that he needed access to her computer in order to fix a virus			1
but ms @entity1 , from @entity27 , said that she realised it was a scam designed to trick her into giving him access to the computer - and the sensitive information stored on it			1
rather than hang up the phone , the party planner decided to chat to the caller - asking him why he made a living from ripping people off			1
she told him that this was his ' wake up call ' and urged him to give up his life of crime and look for a job that would ' make his children proud '			1
ms @entity1 , who lives with her partner , claimed that he called her back 10 days later saying that he had left his days as a conman behind him and was now on the hunt for a legitimate job			1
she said : ' this man had gone off the path and he just needed a little nudge back on			0
' when you deal with it in a horrible way you feel cross afterwards - it 's a residue that stays with you			0
' when i dealt with it in a positive way i felt much nicer - it 's a good thing for everyone			0
' ms @entity1 , who used to slam the phone down on cold callers , added that she spoke to @entity6 just days after she made a decision that she would be nicer to them			1
she said : ' i did n't have long to think about how i was going to deal with it differently			0
' he started saying he was from @entity5 and there was a virus on my computer and went on like that in the way they do			2
' but i started to talk over him			0
i said " do you really want to help me ? i 'm not sure that you really do "			0
gradually he went quiet and started listening to me			0
' i said to him " i think you know that this is not truthful , and not honest , and not the path you should be choosing "			0
' it sound like a lecture now i think about it , and he went really quiet and i thought he was going to put down the phone but he said to me " i think about that every day "			0
' new tack : ms @entity1 , who lives with her partner in @entity27 , said decided to treat callers with more kindness just days before ' @entity6 ' phoned			1
the mother - of - two claims to have convinced him to give up his criminal lifestyle ms @entity1 claimed that she told the man this was his ' wake up call ' and urged him to walk out on the scam and find legitimate work			1
she added : ' i told him " you 're never going to be happy or proud doing a job like this "			2
' this scam is n't going to catch out people like me , but it might catch out someone who is not computer literate , like my mother - that 's people like your grandparents			1
' he said " yes " and i said that he should do something that makes his children proud			2
' we wished each other a good day and i thought that was that			0
' but around ten days later she said that she received a call from ' @entity6 ' , who told her he had put his criminal life in his past			2
she said : ' first of all i thought it was another scam phone call but he asked " do you remember me ? " and i realised who it was			2
' he said he had phoned me up to tell me that he had left his job			2
i told him i thought that was amazing and thanked him for phoning me			0
' i asked him how it made him feel and he said he can finally sleep at night			0
' ms @entity1 is now urging other people to engage with phone scammers in an attempt to get them to turn their back on their criminal ways .			1
