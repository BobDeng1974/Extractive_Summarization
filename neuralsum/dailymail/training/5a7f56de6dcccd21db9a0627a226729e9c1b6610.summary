@entity0 today announced production of what they claim is the world 's most fuel efficient car - capable of a staggering 313 miles per gallon			0
the radical @entity6 will be powered by a tiny 800cc diesel engine and a separate electric motor and battery pack			1
this will give the plug - in hybrid a 0 - 62mph time of 12.2 seconds and a top speed limited to a modest 99mph			1
this means when driven in a fuel - conserving fashion the lightweight vehicle would cost around £ 1.40 to travel 62 miles			0
it can also cover a distance of up to 31 miles ( 50km ) in all - electric mode where it emits zero carbon dioxide			1
overall emissions are a mere 21g/km - less than a quarter of the amount produced by the ultra-green @entity34			2
@entity0 plan to produce 50 of the carbon fibre cars by the end of the year @entity0 claim the car will have a range of up to 31 miles in its all - electric mode the two engines sit at the rear , with the high - voltage battery that powers the electric motor at the front despite weighing just 795kg , the @entity15 is tough thanks to its carbon fibre			1
@entity0 confirmed it will build an initial 50 models at the company 's @entity51 factory in @entity53 alongside its @entity54 and @entity55			0
however , the firm refused to give any indication on how much the aerodynamic two - seater will cost			0
the @entity15 will be on show at next month 's @entity17 with the first models produced by the end of 2013			2
it will appear alongside @entity62 's recently announced supercar , the @entity63 - a 903bhp beast that goes from 0 - 62mph in under three seconds - but also boasts environmental credentials			0
@entity62 say the £ 800,000 car 's carbon dioxide emissions are ' less than 200g/km ' - which is better than a 2.4 - litre @entity69 family saloon			2
the @entity63 will make its global debut at next month 's @entity17 , with deliveries of the £ 800,000 - plus car expected by the end of 2013 @entity62 's @entity63 will emit less carbon dioxide than many family saloons the @entity34 has become the benchmark for environmentally friendly cars @entity77 boasting an electric - drive and petrol - powered generator for when the estimated 40 - mile range is reached			1
the combined economy figure is an impressive @entity83 plug - in can manage an all - electric range of up to 15 miles before the petrol engine kicks in , giving a combined consumption figure of @entity87 with 397hp under the hood , this luxury saloon is n’t slow , and 0 - 60mph takes just 6.3 seconds - all while managing a claimed 62.4mpg			1
@entity91 it 's much lighter than the bigger editions , it 's more fuel - efficient , averaging up to 81mpg			0
it can travel for around a mile using electric power @entity96 1.5 dci 90 @entity97 has a 1.5 - litre diesel engine that ’s capable of @entity99 this diesel model , using a 1.1 - litre three - cylinder engine , averages an impressive 88.3mpg			2

the @entity15 will have an 800cc diesel engine and separate electric motor
it can travel 31 miles using the electric motor - emitting zero carbon dioxide
normal mode produces less than a quarter of the carbon dioxide *pumped* out by a @entity34
meanwhile @entity133 *unveiled* a more *practical* new plug - in petrol - electric hybrid @entity136 *e-tron* model which it says will manage *188.3mpg* with ultra low @entity138 emissions of just *35/km.the* *manufacturer* says the car will still accelerate from rest to 62mph in just *7.6* seconds and have a top speed of *138mph* . it is to be *launched* *officially* at next month ’s @entity17 .
