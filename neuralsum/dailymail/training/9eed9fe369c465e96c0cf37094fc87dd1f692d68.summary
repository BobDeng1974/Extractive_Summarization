four new mysterious giant craters have appeared in the @entity2 permafrost in northern @entity3 , sparking fears that global warming may be causing gas to erupt from underground			1
scientists spotted the new holes , along with dozens of other smaller ones , in the same area as three other enormous craters that were spotted on the @entity13 last year			1
the craters are thought to be caused by eruptions of methane gas from the permafrost as rising rising temperatures causes the frozen soil to melt			1
one of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo			1
this is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land			0
when the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled			0
the other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground			2
@entity50 is rich in natural gas , and a mixture of water , salt and gas could result in an explosion			2
however in an article for @entity59 , professor @entity60 there were no traces of the gas found in the soil nor were there any charred rock			1
instead he suggests it could also have been caused by an eruption of gas from the underground reservoir , possibly as pressure has increased as temperatures have risen			1
the other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite , but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters			1
one of new craters , surrounded by at least 20 smaller holes , is just six miles from a major gas production plant			1
experts have predicted there could be up to 30 more are waiting to be discovered			2
@entity84 , however , are still largely baffled by the exact processes causing the craters			2
professor @entity60 , deputy director of the @entity89 - based @entity88 , part of the @entity91 , has called for ' urgent ' investigation of the new phenomenon amid safety fears			1
until now , the existence of only three @entity2 craters had been established when great caverns in the frozen landscape were spotted by passing helicopter pilots			1
' we know now of seven craters in the @entity103 area , ' professor @entity60 told @entity104			2
' five are directly on the @entity13 peninsula , one in @entity107 , and one is on the north of the @entity111 region , near the @entity113 peninsula			1
' we have exact locations for only four of them			0
' the other three were spotted by reindeer herders			0
' but i am sure that there are more craters on @entity13 , we just need to search for them			2
i would compare this with mushrooms			0
' when you find one mushroom , be sure there are few more around			0
i suppose there could be 20 to 30 craters more			0
' two of the newly - discovered large craters - also known as funnels to scientists - have turned into lakes , revealed professor @entity60			2
' it is important not to scare people , but this is a very serious problem			0
' we must research this phenomenon urgently to prevent possible disasters			0
we can not rule out new gas emissions in the @entity103 and in some cases they can ignite			0
' explosion ? this crater ( named @entity142 ) was spotted near to @entity143 in the @entity13 after locals saw a flash of light nearby this map shows the location of the new craters ( labelled @entity23 - 4 ) along with the previously discovered holes marked with black dots the top satellite image shows an accumulation of ice beneath the surface , known as a pingo , while a more recent image shows a lake has formed in a crater scientists have called @entity160 , surrounded by smaller holes professor @entity60 said that the parapet of the craters suggested an eruption of gas from a shallow underground reservoir			1
the first hole was spotted in 2013 by helicopter pilots 20 miles from a gas extraction plant at @entity170 , on the @entity13			1
an examination of the area using satellite images , comparing landscapes in the past with the present day , has alerted @entity3 experts to the prospect that the phenomenon is more widespread than first thought			2
@entity180 : this crater , called @entity23 , was first spotted 18 miles ( 30 km ) from the @entity182 by passing helicopter pilots simmering : methane gas can be seen bubbling up out of this lake in the @entity13 region and is thought to be an old crater experts are particularly interested in a crater they have named @entity160 , which just six miles to the south of the @entity192 gas field at @entity170			1
old satellite imagery shows no sign of craters at the site but more recent images show there is now a lake there measuring about 5,000 square metres			0
the lake is thought to have formed in a hole that is 100 metres by 50 metres in diametre and is surrounded by 20 smaller holes filled with water that are around one to two metres wide			0
residents living near to another of the craters , close to @entity143 on the @entity13 , reported seeing a flash of light			1
this has led some to conclude that it was the result of gas trapped in the permafrost exploding			2
professor @entity60 said : ' we need to answer now the basic questions : what areas , and under what conditions , are the most dangerous ? last year scientists took a closer look at one of the older craters by climbing 54 feet down its frozen sides when this crater was discovered in 2014 , theories ranged from a man - made hoax , to aliens or a meteorite ' these questions are important for the safe operation of the northern cities and infrastructure of oil and gas complexes			1
' there is already scientific concern that @entity239 , the largest and oldest freshwater lake in the world , but well outside the @entity242 , could be at risk of similar gas explosions			0
scientists have previously said there is growing evidence that rising temperatures in the region could be the main catalyst triggering the blasts			1
it is thought permafrost at the sites could have one million times more methane hydrates locked inside than ordinary gas			0
one expert estimated that the total explosive power of the craters has been the equivalent of about 11 tonnes of @entity261			0
scientists are attempting to visit all of the craters , like above , to better understand how they were formed in the winter the sides of the craters freeze , like above , making it easier for scientists to take samples there are also two tectonic fault lines across the @entity13 , with another possibility being that the blow - outs are caused by a deadly combination of heat leaving these rifts , a higher than normal air temperature , and the ' fire ice ' melting			1
professor @entity60 revealed one picture of a @entity13 lake showing signs of what he calls ' degassing '			2
' this haze that you see on the surface shows gas seeps from the bottom of the lake to the surface , ' he said			0
' we call this process ' degassing '			0
' he is not sure if this lake , too , was previously a crater ' or if the lake formed from another process			0
' more important is that the gases from within are actively seeping through this lake			0

four new craters have been spotted by scientists in the @entity13 peninsula , in @entity2
may be caused by gas from underground and fear craters becoming more common *due* to rising temperatures
@entity310 flash of light seen close to one crater which led to theories that buried gas *pockets* in the soil may be igniting
another new crater has been found less than six miles from a major gas plant and experts have called for an urgent investigation into the phenomenon
