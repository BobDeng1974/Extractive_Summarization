a young albino kangaroo , spotted grazing on a rural property beside her mother , has delighted three young children who were convinced that its strange colouring was a joke			1
@entity9 , who said he had noticed the white roo as joey on his @entity13 property in @entity14 before , said it often visited his land			2
' the kids … came running into the house saying " @entity19 ! someone spray - painted him " , ' mr @entity9 said to @entity20			0
' yes it 's an albino , not spray painted			0
it 's definitely an albino eastern grey kangaroo , a young girl with her mum , ' dr @entity28 said			1
he added that the occurrence of albinism in any species was incredibly rare and occurred in one - in - 20,000			2
' the kids … came running into the house saying " @entity19 ! someone spray - painted him " , ' mr @entity9 said albinism is a hereditary condition that is characterised by a lack of pigment in eyes , skin , hair , scales , or feathers			2
@entity28 , director of @entity53 confirmed the roo was a healthy ' they tend to get reported when people see them and that happens once every couple of years - it 's a rare event but it happens well across all animal species , ' dr @entity28 said			1
' i 've got photos of an albino wombat down in @entity65 that we caught on some remote camera - traps last year			0
' however dr ramp , who is working with an albino kangaroo population at @entity70 in @entity71 , said the young grey roo appeared to be quite healthy after examining the video captured by mr @entity9			1
as part of his own work , dr @entity28 is examining whether higher than average numbers of albino kangaroos in a certain population indicate that there are wider problems at hand , such as inbreeding			1
' while it 's not particularly negative for the individual kangaroos , it may mean these animals are inbreeding more than they normally would because they are constrained and they are struggling to connect with other populations , ' he said			0
' in our @entity70 studies we are wondering if the landscape is fraught for kangaroos			0
' ' it 's a rare event but it happens well across all animal species , ' dr @entity28 said of albinism in animals			1
one of his remote camera traps that detects motion captured this image of an albino wombat at @entity99 in @entity14 during research into the importance of foraging herbivores in reducing fire risk albinism is a hereditary condition that is characterised by a lack of pigment in eyes , skin , hair , scales , or feathers			0

@entity9 said the roo and its mother often visited his rural property
@entity28 , the director of the @entity29 for @entity30 , confirmed it was a young , female , albino grey kangaroo
albinism is a rare genetic condition that occurs in one - in - 20,000
dr @entity28 said while they were rare , more albinos than normal in one population could indicate a wider problem for the animal species
