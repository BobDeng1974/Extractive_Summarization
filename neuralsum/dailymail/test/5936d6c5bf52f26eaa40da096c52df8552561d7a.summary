mystery surrounds the sensational @entity2 footage showing the gem thieves in the middle of their audacious Â£ 60million heist after it was suggested that the police had missed this crucial evidence			1
the @entity9 published sensational pictures of the @entity12 raiders 21 hours before @entity13 released them in a bid to appeal for information about identities of the thieves			1
the tabloid claims it handed the images to police , who were ' delighted ' , according to a report today in its sister title @entity24 , with an apparent source saying it ' blows the case wide open '			1
but yesterday afternoon detectives insisted they already had the @entity2 footage , which they claim was recovered ' at the earliest opportunity '			2
pictured : the @entity31 has released images of three of the gang which broke into @entity12 over the @entity35 weekend - but has only done so after the shots were revealed by the @entity9 audacious : exactly why the police did not release the images beforehand is unclear - especially as the tabloid 's sister paper @entity24 claims they are the key to ' cracking the case wide open ' this is in stark contrast with the response given to @entity46 hours before , when police refused to say whether they had the footage			1
the @entity31 finally released the pictures late on saturday afternoon , while @entity9 could sell the images to a number of other national titles , including this website			1
up until that point , no other newspaper was able to help the police trace the culprits of what could be the biggest ever robbery in @entity60			0
it raises questions about why the police chose to keep them to themselves - or whether they even had the footage			2
speaking to @entity69 's today programme this morning , former @entity67 chief @entity66 said : ' i 've never heard of anything like this			1
' i 'm not blaming @entity9 , but i am pointing some quite accusing fingers at the police for not finding it themselves			2
' questions : former @entity67 chief @entity66 said he had ' never heard of anything like ' a newspaper getting such crucial footage before the police got their hands on it - although police now say they had it it is likely to put further pressure on an investigation which has already been accused of a number of failings			1
owners of the security deposit boxes are continuing to demand answers on why police failed to respond to the alarm when it first went off over the long weekend			0
and now the @entity46 has revealed some have resorted to bribing security guards , as they desperately try to find out information about what has been lost			0
the gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault the @entity2 will have gone some way to answering questions for those who lost thousands of pounds in the theft			0
it reveals how the raiders entered the building by a side door on thursday evening , minutes after staff left the premises			2
they then entered the basement through the lift shaft , and broke through the shutters before spending hours in the vault - emerging the next morning carrying the gems out the building in a wheelie bin			0
they then returned on saturday night , apparently repeating the process throughout the night , leaving early on the morning of @entity125			0
the burglary was discovered on tuesday morning			0
police have now said 72 out of the vaults 999 boxes were opened .			0

@entity9 published the first pictures of the six thieves on saturday
@entity13 finally released images of only three raiders 21 hours later
former @entity67 chief said he ' has never heard of anything like this '
