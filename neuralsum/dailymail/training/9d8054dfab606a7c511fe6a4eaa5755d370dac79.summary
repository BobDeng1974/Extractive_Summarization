by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 10:45 est , 15 september 2013 it is a magical kingdom that has brought joy to millions of families throughout the world			1
but now , a 5,000 - strong petition has been launched against @entity6 , claiming the popular holiday resort has been ' seriously damaged ' and is ' literally falling apart '			1
it comes amid complaints about reheated food , broken rides and cancelled stage shows			1
hundreds of @entity13 have shown their support for the petition , which has 5,147 signatures so far			1
it has been addressed to @entity31 , chief executive of the @entity33 - based @entity32 , which owns 39.8 per cent of the @entity21 resort			1
' the upkeep of parks , attractions and hotels has been neglected so often during the past 20 years that many facilities are not " @entity29 standard " , ' it reads			2
' many themed elements are decaying and crumbling , while others are literally falling apart			1
' @entity44 , from @entity45 , was one of the @entity13 to sign the petition			1
he said : ' i have long been a visitor to @entity6 , and over the last few years have sadly seen a decline in a number of things , all of which have been mentioned in the petition			0
' what strikes me about all of the @entity29 resorts i have visited is that , no matter where people are from , the one thing that remains the same world over is the @entity29 magic			2
' therefore , i feel it is unfair that @entity6 has been allowed to decline so sadly , and its visitors are allowed to experience what i believe is now an inferior experience			0
' @entity66 from @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , added : ' i expect value for money and having stayed there a number of time , i feel the value has dropped with each subsequent visit			0
' on parade : @entity79 characters @entity80 and @entity81 entertain crowds at the @entity21 resort the petition , which was sent to mr @entity31 earlier this week , was started by @entity87 theme park enthusiast @entity85 , who claims he was disappointed by his latest visit to the park			1
he told @entity90 he was shocked to discover four of the shows had been cancelled , two attractions were closed and a high number of rides kept breaking down			2
he also claimed that food in one of the resort 's most expensive restaurants appeared to have been re-heated			2
' we received our dishes in less than five minutes which is obviously too short a time for our food to have been cooked after we ordered , ” said mr @entity85			0
the petition , which has been translated into six languages , claims the park 's fast food outlets are steep in price and can not compete with other nearby restaurants , such as @entity109 's			2
it also highlights the ' early ' closing times of the resort 's restaurants			2
' when @entity116 closes at 11pm , you would expect to be able to have a nice evening dinner , not to discover the restaurant closed at 7.30pm , ' it reads			0
' these short opening hours make it impossible to book a meal for later in the day - you either have to plan ahead or settle for counter service offerings in @entity116 or @entity124			0
' fight : the petition was addressed to @entity31 ( pictured ) , chief executive of the @entity33 - based @entity32 , which owns 39.8 per cent of @entity6 it also acknowledges the number of stage shows that have been cancelled due to budget cuts			1
these include the @entity132 show at the @entity133 , @entity134 show at @entity135 and the iconic night - time parade , @entity29 's @entity137 ! @entity6 , which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year , has long been considered @entity140 's number one tourist destination			1
despite a rocky beginning - seeing low visitor numbers and financial problems - the park went from strength to strength and now houses five themed lands , featuring 49 attractions			0
last year , it saw a record 16 million people go through its ornate iron gates - giving it nearly as many visitors as the @entity153 and the @entity154 combined			0
however , it has always been considered a poorer imitation of its sister resort in @entity159 , which has three times more parks and considerably better weather			0
the petition , which claims the park 's quality has been sacrificed in a bid to boost attendance figures and reduce costs , is another blow for @entity6 , which has recently been the subject of much controversy			2
earlier this year , @entity6 , the company that runs @entity6 , and two former gendarmes were fined 150,000 euros for using spying tactics on candidates applying for jobs at the theme park			0
and last year , an array of the park 's cartoon characters went on strike over low wages , @entity6 was unavailable for comment			0
the petition , titled ' @entity184 , has been launched in a bid to restore the @entity21 holiday park to its former glory			1
the resort opened its ornate gates for the first time in april 1992			1
it has highlighted a range of issues at the park , which it claims is ' literally falling apart ' , including : maintenance ' the upkeep of parks , attractions and hotels has been neglected so often during the past 20 years that many facilities are not “ @entity29 standard ”			1
' many themed elements are decaying and crumbling , while others are literally falling apart			1
' budget cuts ' the @entity132 show at the @entity133 , @entity134 show at @entity135 , and the iconic night - time parade @entity29 ’s @entity137 ! were all cancelled this year			2
' meanwhile , other show venues , such as @entity208 , have been left disused and empty for years ' ' the lack of maintenance combined with the budget cuts have created a never - ending cycle of ride breakdowns , which affects all types of rides ' food'in recent years , the quality of the food offered at the more expensive table service restaurants has been declining			0
' dishes of industrial pre-cooked meals are served in mere minutes after taking up the order , an indication the food was not made - to - order			0
' @entity225 ' the lack of attractions , the bare environment , the unclear overall theme , the poorly designed master plan and the low capacity of the new attractions are all major issues			0
' this park needs a serious placemaking project and a complete reevaluation of its theme to bring it up to the standards of your company			0

more than 5,000 people , including hundreds of @entity13 , have signed the petition , titled ' @entity244 '
it says the resort has been ' seriously damaged ' and is ' literally falling apart '
it comes amid complaints of broken rides , reheated food and no stage shows
