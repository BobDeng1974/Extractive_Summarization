' that 's still something we have to be concerned and worried about			2
but now there 's a much wider range , with chaotic attacks across the world using knives , using vehicles			2
' the real aim being to kill and get footage of that to propagate the message and propagate their cause			0
' his words echo the case of @entity25 teenager @entity55 , who was jailed in february for plotting a ' @entity57 - style ' attack on a @entity59 soldier or policeman			1
he fell under the spell of the notorious @entity62 once fronted by hate preacher @entity63 after being made homeless in @entity25			0

it 's not far from budget holiday trips to @entity87 and @entity88 that those terror groups travel to , to exploit			0
' more than 600 @entity59 jihadists have travelled to join @entity3 , with half returning to pose a threat on @entity59 streets			1
but mr @entity10 said around 50 per cent did not have terror links before flying to @entity78			0
instead , many had been radicalised via propaganda on social media , by extremists , hate preachers and fighters such as @entity102 john - real name @entity100			1
branding @entity3 a cult , mr @entity10 added : ' it is actually looking to inspire people to support their cause			1

mentally ill @entity64 ( right ) was also goaded into carrying out a nail bomb attack in 2008 mr @entity10 added : ' we have terrorist groups now able , from relatively safe environments in ungoverned space of broken areas of the country , to reach into communities in the @entity59 and influence people to act in their name to commit terrorist act			1
that is a fundamental difference in the challenge the @entity59 is facing			0
' the speech came amid reports that @entity3 chief @entity131 has been injured in an air strike in @entity79 and is no longer in control of the group			2
it is said his deputies in the organisation have been running day - to - day activities while he recovers , following the reported attack on march 18			2

she said he was an ' easy target , easy prey ' for radicalisation			0
judge mr justice @entity169 , who jailed @entity141 for life for attempted murder , said after the trial : ' there is evidence from materials seized that he became increasingly drawn to violent action in support of fellow @entity178 in revenge for perceived persecution , and to the idea of himself personally becoming a martyr			0
