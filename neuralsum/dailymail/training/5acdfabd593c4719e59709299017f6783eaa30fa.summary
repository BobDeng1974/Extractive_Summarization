vulnerable teenagers are being sexually assaulted by gangs of men in towns and cities across the country , the child protection expert who exposed the scale of abuse in @entity3 told @entity10 today			1
professor @entity11 was in the @entity12 following her bombshell report in august which revealed around 1,400 children had been raped and abused by gangs of @entity16 men in the @entity18 town			1
she said the level of abuse went unreported for 16 years because staff feared they would be seen as racist			1
but speaking today professor @entity24 said the problem was not confined to @entity3			1
asked by mps whether the abuse was happening in towns and cities elsewhere in the country , she said : ‘ yes i do believe that			2
i certainly do n’t think @entity3 is unique			2
’ professor @entity24 's report into the @entity3 abuse scandal revealed child protection staff did not speak out about @entity16 gangs raping young girls for fear of being labelled ' racist ' children as young as 11 were trafficked , beaten , and raped by large numbers of men between 1997 and 2013 in @entity3			1
more than a third of the cases were already know to agencies			0
but professor @entity24 said : ' several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist '			1
she condemned the ' blatant ' collective failures by the council 's leadership , concluding : ' it is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered			0
' the landmark report exposed widespread failures of the council , police and social services			0
it revealed victims were doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight , terrorised with guns , made to witness brutally - violent rapes and told they would be the next if they spoke out			0
the victims were raped by multiple abusers , trafficked to other towns and cities in the north of @entity71 , abducted , beaten and intimidated			2
despite the abuse , police ' regarded many child victims with contempt ' and some fathers who tried to rescue their children from abuse were arrested themselves			2
@entity79 and crime commissioner @entity80 resigned in the wake of professor @entity24 's damning report prof @entity24 said the majority of the abusers were described as ' @entity16 men ' , and many were said to be of @entity88 origin			1
one young person told the inquiry that ' gang rape ' was a usual part of growing up in the area of @entity3 where she lived			1
in two cases , fathers had tracked down their daughters and tried to remove them from houses where they were being abused - only to be arrested themselves when police were called to the scene			2
and one child declined her initial offer to give a statement after allegedly receiving a text from a perpetrator threatening to harm her younger sister			0
the failures happened despite three reports between 2002 and 2006 ' which could not have been clearer in the description of the situation in @entity3 '			2
prof @entity24 said the first of these reports was ' effectively suppressed ' because senior officers did not believe the data			0
the other two were ignored , the professor said			0
teachers reported seeing children as young as 11 , 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis , given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown men in @entity3 or other local towns and cities			1
the majority of victims believed the perpetrators to be their boyfriend who gave them gifts , alcohol and drugs			0
some of the victims still maintain they were not groomed or abused			0
analysing the case studies , prof @entity24 said many of the children came from dysfunctional families , had parents with addictions , and had suffered domestic or sexual abuse as a child			1
some had serious mental health problems			0
the spotlight first fell on @entity3 in 2010 when five men , described by a judge as ' sexual predators ' , were jailed for grooming teenage girls for sex			1
@entity150 ( left ) and @entity151 ( right ) were two of five @entity16 men convicted of grooming of teenage girls in @entity3 in 2010 the five men - @entity151 , @entity156 , @entity151 , @entity151 , and @entity150 - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances			1
one of the men branded his victim a ‘ white bitch ’ when she resisted , while a second smirked : ‘ i ’ve used you and abused you			0
' the men , all @entity164 - born @entity88 , attacked the four girls in play areas , parks and in the back of their cars , @entity169 @entity168 heard .			0
