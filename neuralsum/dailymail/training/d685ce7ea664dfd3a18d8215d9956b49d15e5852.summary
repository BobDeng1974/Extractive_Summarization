hours after signing for @entity1 , @entity0 was back down to @entity3 business with @entity4 as they trained ahead of their game against @entity8 on friday			1
@entity0 left @entity9 in a £ 30million move which will net him £ 150,000 a week but before he begins life in @entity12 he has the small matter of a @entity3 to defend			1
and the 27 - year - old former @entity15 captain appeared to take the move in his stride smiling and joking as he trained alongside @entity1 striker @entity18 and @entity19 who could follow him in swapping @entity20 for @entity21 this summer			1
new focus : @entity0 trained with @entity4 as a @entity1 player for the first time fresh start : @entity26 will join @entity1 on a five - year deal after former club @entity15 failed to move for him in the money : @entity26 will reportedly earn £ 150,000 a week at @entity1 who paid £ 30m for his services @entity32 : @entity33 striker @entity19 looks likely to follow @entity0 to @entity1 this summer familiar face : @entity18 will be able to tell @entity0 all about the workings of @entity1 ahead of the game against the side they beat in the 2010 @entity3 final , @entity4 coach @entity36 has dismissed the suggestion that his side have peaked			1
in fact he talked up their chances of getting better with stars continuing to emerge from the under - 21 set - up all the time			1
he said : ' @entity49 starts now			0
if we can concentrate throughout 21 days then hopefully we will live up to the standards required of a world champion			0
' i wo n't reveal tomorrow 's line - up			2
we will use the players who we think are the best - but we do have 23 very good players			2
' i do n't think this is a team of veterans , i 'd say we 're mature			0
we 're simply not afraid of anything and that 's not just because of our past successes			0
' i 'm not worried about the future either			0
looking at the under - 21 team i think we can have high expectations			2
' @entity8 have changed a lot over the last four years , but we have not			1
' @entity8 have a great school of football and have always had good @entity68			1
' i hold ( coach @entity71 ) @entity70 in high esteem and i 'm sure he 's prepared well for the game			2
' happy camp : @entity36 's side kick off the defence of their @entity3 crown against @entity8 head of the family : @entity36 has led @entity4 to the @entity79 and 2012 @entity81 championships @entity4 must later face @entity82 and @entity83 in @entity84 and @entity9 midfielder @entity86 admitted he would have readily coped without dancing around the physicality of the @entity88 in the opening fixture			1
' we arrived here with a lot of enthusiasm even though we know the group will be very difficult , ' he said			0
' starting off against the previous runners - up is not easy			2
' but we got here by remaining faithful to our style and so it will continue			2
hopefully our style of play will bring us more success			0
" meanwhile , goalkeeper @entity102 , who is preparing to play in his third @entity3 with @entity4 , has identified @entity104 winger @entity103 as @entity8 's main threat			1
the pair played together at @entity107 for three years and were most recently pitted against each other as the @entity109 met @entity104 in the semi-finals of the @entity111			0
' @entity103 is a great winger , ' @entity102 said			0
' i 've known him since we were team - mates and i 've come up against him several times since			0
' if we show the humility and enthusiasm we have over recent years then we 'll be able to do well			0
' strength in depth : @entity119 's @entity118 is not likely to be a starter for @entity4 this summer down under : @entity121 will play in the @entity124 @entity123 next season for @entity125			1
