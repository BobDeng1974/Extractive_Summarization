by @entity0 @entity1 is so besotted with her dog @entity3 that she has taken a photograph of him every day for a year			1
in addition @entity6 , 54 , has blogged about how @entity3 , three , changed from a shy and fearful rescue puppy to a friendly and confident canine			2
the dog blog started in march last year three months after @entity3 arrived at @entity6 's home in @entity12 , @entity13 , from a violent and uncertain life in @entity15			1
@entity3 , @entity3 the dog : everyone knows his name since he arrived from @entity15 when @entity3 arrived from @entity15 , he was shy and fearful			1
now he is a loving dog who enjoys his life the @entity23 wirehaired pointer cross has since become a hit with 20,000 views on the online photo sharing journal @entity27 from as far wide as @entity28 and @entity29			1
mother - of - one @entity6 said : ‘ the project did n't start as a way of showing @entity3 's journey but the way he has flourished whilst being here in @entity13 has just been phenomenal			2
‘ when @entity3 first came over he was scared of cars and had not seen horses or sheep and was always wondering if they were going to hurt him			0
not content with being an internet sensation , @entity3 has now been captured on canvas ‘ that was the best thing about photographing him every day for a year - seeing the change and progression of him			0
‘ it is his personal story captured on camera			0
’ @entity3 the dog came to @entity50 in a van with around 30 other dogs from @entity15 , saved by a charity based in the country			1
amateur photographer @entity6 said : ‘ he came to us as a very nervous and naive dog and the journal tells the story of his growing trust in the human race after a very bad start and his joy at finding a home surrounded by beautiful countryside that he can explore			0
‘ i was actually looking through a magazine and there was an article about new websites , one of which was @entity27 , which is a social media site where you upload a picture a day , so i gave it a go			0
‘ i basically signed up to it because i wanted to better my photography skills but am quite a private person so did not want my own life out on display			0
one woman and her dog : @entity1 with @entity3 ( centre ) and her 13 - year - old son @entity84 ‘ it has certainly helped me understand the camera more by using different modes and i am able to capture different types of picture now too			1
’ miss @entity1 has not carried on with @entity3 's daily journal since it finished but has been inundated with requests to continue it			2
she added : ‘ i wanted to take a rest from uploading pictures but i get people from @entity97 , @entity29 , @entity98 and wherever else asking for updates on @entity3 , so i am going to put one up every now and again			0
’ game boy : @entity3 loves posing for photographs ( left ) , almost as much as he likes skittles ( right ) anyone for tennis ? @entity3 would make a good ball dog at next year 's @entity107 championships go wild in the country : @entity3 lets the wind ruffle his fur as he runs around in the @entity13 countryside			2

@entity3 was a rescue dog from @entity15 who came to @entity12 , @entity13 , in *december* 2012
three months later , his *mistress* @entity1 , 54 , began to upload daily photos of him
since then pictures of the @entity23 wirehaired pointer cross have been seen more than 20,000 times by people all over the world
