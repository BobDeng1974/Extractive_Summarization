in may 2012 @entity1 's symptoms began to get gradually worse , until she was in constant pain sitting in a chair might not sound like a particularly special experience — but for @entity1 , it ’s bliss			1
she is recovering from a two - year battle with a spinal condition , which made sitting excruciatingly painful			2
‘ it was like sitting on a golf ball with nails sticking out of it , ’ says @entity1 , 58 , who lives with her sales manager husband , @entity8 , also 58 , in @entity9 , @entity10			1
@entity1 ’s symptoms began gradually in may 2012 , and worsened over several weeks , until she was in constant pain			2
‘ it was always there , though standing and lying were easier than sitting , ’ says @entity1			2
her misery was compounded by her job as a junior school teacher			0
‘ i sit with the children and have lots of meetings — my days were filled with pain and , often , i resorted to standing instead , ’ she says			0
along with pain while sitting , @entity1 also experienced severe pain down the outside of her left thigh			2
‘ i ’d been running a lot , so i thought it might be some kind of back injury related to that			0
’ after suffering for about six weeks , @entity1 went to a physiotherapist who diagnosed piriformis syndrome , where the piriformis , a muscle in the buttock , irritates the sciatic nerve , which runs through the buttock and into the leg			1
but physiotherapy , cortisone injections — designed to reduce inflammation — and osteopathy all failed to help			1
she then saw a skeletal and sports consultant who gave her an mri scan , but could n’t see anything wrong , and diagnosed nerve damage			2
she was told to rest , and her gp prescribed a painkiller - releasing patch			0
@entity1 hoped the pain would pass but , instead , it got worse			2
‘ sitting was unbearable without a cushion , ’ she says			2
‘ i ’d take one everywhere and try to make light of it , saying , “ i ’ve not got piles ! ” ’ but it was no joke — daily life became a struggle			0
‘ i coped with my job — it offered some distraction — but could do little else , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ our social life ground to a halt			0
’ in june 2013 , she returned to her gp and pleaded for another scan			1
this time , the bottom of her spine was scanned and doctors found what ’s known as a @entity79 cyst			1
@entity79 cysts , also known as perineural cysts , are named after the late @entity83 neurosurgeon @entity79 , who first documented them			1
they are found on the roots of spinal nerves , which are covered by a protective sheath			1
when the spinal fluid that surrounds the spinal column finds a weakness in the sheath , it balloons out , forming a cyst			0
the cysts can compress nearby nerves , causing a range of problems , including pain around the tail bone and buttocks , or the perineum , and pain in the legs			1
other symptoms include bowel and bladder problems , such as constipation or needing to urinate too frequently , and , in women , painful sexual intercourse			1
@entity79 cysts can form anywhere along the spine , but tend to be found in the sacral area at the base , which is why sitting can be so painful			1
over time , they can erode the bone of the sacrum , causing further pain			0
up to one in ten of us is thought to have a @entity79 cyst , but they cause symptoms in fewer than five per cent of cases			1
the cysts vary in size — usually from a few millimetres in diameter up to a couple of centimetres — and many patients have more than one , says @entity129 , a neurologist and spine specialist at the @entity131 , @entity132			0
at 5cm across , @entity1 ’s cyst was very large			2
women are affected far more than men , although it is n’t known why , says mr @entity129			0
the now 58 - year - old was initially diagnosed with piriformis syndrome , which irritates the sciatic nerve which runs through the buttock and leg @entity79 cysts are usually identified using mri scans			1

the cysts vary in size — usually from a few millimetres in diameter up to a couple of centimetres — and many patients have more than one , says @entity129 , a neurologist and spine specialist at the @entity131 , @entity132			0
it is thought that people with connective tissue disorders , such as @entity196 , which affect the tissue supporting the organs and other parts of the body , may be predisposed to developing @entity79 cysts			1
trauma — a fall , for example — may also cause an unproblematic cyst to become a problematic one , by increasing spinal fluid pressure , further inflating the cyst			0
@entity79 cysts can be identified clearly using mri scans			1
however , as @entity1 found , cysts that cause problems are often misdiagnosed , because the symptoms overlap with other conditions , such as piriformis syndrome and nerve damage			1
mr @entity129 says he sees @entity79 cyst patients from around the country whose cases have perplexed other doctors			2
in @entity1 ’s case , once the cyst was identified , she was referred to a pain management and spinal consultant , who suggested draining the cyst via a hollow needle			2
‘ big mistake , ’ says @entity1			0
she found the hour - long procedure agonising and derived no benefit , because the cyst refilled			2
in desperation , @entity1 searched online for answers and found the website of dr @entity233 , a @entity234 neurosurgeon who was widely regarded as the world expert on @entity79 cysts			1
he is keener on surgery than other doctors , and operates in the @entity83 and at a centre in @entity240			0
@entity1 emailed her mri scan to dr @entity233 ’s office , and was delighted when he called back			1
but when her pain worsened mrs @entity1 , pictured with her husband @entity8 , also 58 , returned to the doctors and was finally scanned in june 2013			1
it revealed she was suffering a @entity79 cyst , which was pressing on nerves in her lower back ‘ it was fantastic to have this world expert ring little old me in the @entity253 , ’ she says			1
‘ he had my scan in front of him and said , “ yes , i can help you ”			0
’ meanwhile , however , @entity1 had seen another @entity253 spinal consultant , who was convinced the @entity79 cyst was not the problem			1
he diagnosed ischiofemoral impingement syndrome , in which pain is caused by abnormal contact between two bones in the pelvic area — the ischium and the top of the femur or thigh bone			2
@entity1 was left not knowing what to do			0
she knew treatment with dr @entity233 would cost a whopping £ 28,000 — and that her medical insurance would only cover half the cost of treatment abroad			2
so initially she persisted with the @entity253 doctor			0
he referred her to another spinal consultant , who recommended a large cortisone injection			0
‘ it made a bit of difference , but not much , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ i said to the doctor , “ @entity283 ? i can not live with this pain			0
” he said , “ you must — plenty of people do ”			0
’ @entity1 decided dr @entity233 was her only hope			1
so she and @entity8 , who have two grown - up sons , flew to @entity240 in april			2
dr @entity233 ’s technique involves making a six to nine centimetre incision in the back , popping the cysts to drain them , and then identifying the weak point in the membrane			1
he mends this area with stitches , then ‘ shrink wraps ’ the cysts with an artificial membrane to ensure they can not re-expand			0
the op usually takes two to three hours			0
according to dr @entity233 , the main problem with the treatment of @entity79 cysts is that many doctors have been taught that they do n’t cause symptoms			1
mrs @entity1 flew to @entity240 in april with her husband @entity8 to have surgery on the cysts			1
her surgeon dr @entity233 's technique involved making an incision in the back and popping the cysts to drain them ‘ some patients are even told they ’re crazy and imagining the pain , ’ he says			1
he has even treated patients who have been misdiagnosed and undergone unnecessary surgery , such as a hysterectomy			0
mr @entity129 says he uses a similar technique to dr @entity321 and that this is available in the @entity253 , on the @entity322 or privately			0
‘ the @entity253 approach is simply more cautious about surgery , due to the risks involved , ’ he says , adding that surgeons here prefer pain management in all but the most severe cases			0
dr @entity233 has operated on more than 800 patients , mr @entity129 about 30			2
the risks of surgery include spinal fluid leaks and injury to the nerve			0
@entity1 was aware of the risks , but had complete faith in dr @entity233			1
‘ he filled me with confidence , ’ she says			0
the surgery was successful and @entity1 was off all painkillers by day three of her ten - day stay in @entity240			2
‘ the difference is unbelievable , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’m 95 per cent recovered already			0
’ she is exercising again , but taking it easy			0
‘ dr @entity233 says it takes about a year for the nerves to settle , ’ she says			1
according to dr @entity233 , about 70 per cent of his patients report improvements in the most common symptoms			1
mr @entity129 admits that @entity253 spine surgeons may have much to learn from dr @entity233 , but wants him to share details of his complication rates to help doctors and patients better understand the surgical risks			1
‘ i ’ve invited him to the @entity253 next year , ’ he says			0
‘ we ’re keen to see his results			0

@entity1 , from @entity10 , was diagnosed with piriformis syndrome
it causes the piriformis - a muscle in the buttock - to irritate the sciatic nerve , which runs through the buttock and into the leg
but physiotherapy , cortisone injections and osteopathy failed to help
her pain got worse and sitting became unbearable without a cushion
a scan in june 2013 revealed a @entity79 cyst at the bottom of her spine
the cysts are found on the roots of spinal nerves and can compress nerves
other symptoms include bowel and bladder problems and pain during sex
in april mrs @entity1 travelled to @entity240 to be treated by a @entity234 world expert on @entity79 cysts
dr @entity233 's technique involved popping the cysts
mrs @entity1 said : ' the difference is unbelieveable '
