by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:39 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 17:02 est , 17 january 2014 one of the principal figures in @entity8 governor @entity7 's ' @entity6 ' scandal is willing to tell what he knows in exchange for immunity from prosecution , it was revealed today			1
@entity14 , the @entity15 official who allegedly spearheaded politically motivated traffic jams on the @entity17 that backed up morning commuters on four days in september , said through his lawyer that he will testify only when he no longer faces the possibility of criminal charges			1
his lawyer , @entity22 , told @entity23 on friday that ' if he has immunity from the relevant entities , he 'll talk			1
the hundreds of pages of emails and text messages he turned over included what some in the state capitol are calling a ' smoking gun ' message			0
in it , former deputy chief of staff @entity40 – publicly fired last week by gov. @entity7 – wrote @entity14 that it was ' time for some traffic problems in @entity75 , ' a @entity8 town where morning commuters enter the busy @entity17			1
' got it , ' replied @entity14 in the email			1
the result was a four - day rearrangement of traffic cones on the bridge 's entry tollgates , choking off the flow of cars from @entity75 and bringing the town to a standstill for hours on end			0
@entity75 mayor @entity90 declined to endorse @entity7 when he ran for re-election last year , and some observers believe the traffic jam was political payback			0
@entity22 said the @entity1 attorney 's office – which @entity7 ran before he became governor – has not stepped forward to offer him immunity			1
a host of current and former @entity7 aides and appointees were served subpoenas thursday night and friday morning			1
the unlucky list includes his chief counsel @entity104 , former deputy chief of staff @entity40 , former political campaign manager @entity105 , chief of staff @entity106 – who @entity7 has nominated to be his state 's attorney general – and his planned replacement @entity111 , plus the governor 's cantankerous longtime spokesman @entity112 , and @entity112 's wife @entity114			0
others who figure in thursday 's legal bloodbath are current and past officials inside the @entity15 and @entity8 , the government behemoth that operates airports , bridges , tunnels , train and bus depots , and maritime ports throughout the nation 's largest metropolitan region			1
@entity15 executive director @entity126 and chairman @entity127 join @entity14 and former @entity126 deputy @entity128 , both @entity7 appointees			1
the avalanche of legal paper will follow 17 people in all , plus three @entity8 organizations that will come under the gaze of a bipartisan @entity8 legislative ' super investigative committee			1
' the ' @entity7 for @entity138 ' political campaign organization is named in one subpoena , according to a source with knowledge of the documents crisscrossing the capitol building in @entity35			2
@entity7 himself is not among those personally targeted for document production or demands for testimony			0
' there 's no intention right now to subpoena the governor , ' @entity149 chairman @entity44 said thursday after the panel 's first meeting			2
' we 've seen nothing in the documents that has – you know – an email from the governor , or to the governor			0
we 've not seen any kind of direct link			0
' @entity7 said tuesday during his annual state of the state address that his administration would ' cooperate with all appropriate investigations , ' business as usual : @entity7 spoke to media and homeowners about the ongoing recovery from @entity172 in the town of @entity174 on thursday @entity128 – former deputy executive director of the @entity30 / @entity8 @entity15 , appointed by @entity7 in 2010 and resigned in december 2013 @entity176 – deputy chief of staff for communications and planning @entity112 – @entity7 's longtime press secretary who also served as his chief public affairs officer for six years in the @entity1 attorney 's office @entity184 – @entity7 's campaign finance director , married to @entity112 since october 2012 @entity111 – director of the governor 's @entity187 , which oversees the @entity15 , and slated to become chief of staff after @entity106 's departure @entity126 – executive director of the @entity15 , appointed by @entity30 gov. @entity192 in 2011 @entity40 – @entity7 's former deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs , fired on jan. 8 @entity104 – chief counselor to the governor , the lawyer tasked with managing the legal end of government policy on a day - to - day basis @entity201 – the @entity7 political operative who unsuccessfully sought a campaign endorsement from @entity75 , @entity8 mayor @entity90 @entity205 – @entity7 's chief of staff and nominee to become attorney @entity208 – @entity7 's deputy communications director @entity127 – chairman of the @entity211 since early 2011 , appointed by @entity7 following work as his campaign counsel @entity105 – @entity7 campaign chief in both 2009 and 2013 , lost consulting contract with the @entity7 - led @entity216 on jan. 8 , along with a chance to chair the @entity8 @entity219 @entity14 – former director of interstate and capital projects at the @entity15 , a position @entity7 reportedly created for him			1
he resigned in december he publicly announced a week ago that he had fired @entity40 after he learned of her links to the bridge lane closures			2
the governor had softer words about @entity105 , his former campaign manager , announcing only that he had lost a consulting contract with the @entity7 - led @entity216 , and would not be permitted to run for the chairmanship of the state @entity219 party			0
@entity106 , @entity230 and @entity112 , however , are closer to gov. @entity7			0
@entity112 has served as his chief media relations man since his days as @entity232 in the @entity8			1
@entity230 , too , served in the @entity1 attorney 's office as @entity7 's top senior prosecutor , and later joined his administration as director of the state 's homeland security agency			0
but @entity106 , said a @entity241 assembly staffer , ' is the biggest slam - dunk of them all for the @entity241			2
' as @entity40 's direct supervisor , the aide told @entity246 , @entity106 is presumed to have known ' anything @entity7 knew about the whole bridge plot			2
' ' and if @entity40 was following the governor 's orders , there 's no way @entity106 was n't the middle - man , ' he said			0
news of @entity112 's subpoena was met by knowing grins among @entity8 journalists who have come to know him as a coarse , salty , and often vulgar gatekeeper to @entity7			1
' the chickens are coming home to roost , ' one such veteran reporter confided in @entity246 , saying @entity112 is known for his ' vicious temper and a vindictive nature that belongs in the @entity266			0
' in one email revealed last week , sent to @entity14 from his personal account , @entity112 referred to a @entity270 reporter as ' such a f * * * ing mutt			2
' in another , referring to the @entity270 journalist 's request for a meeting between the governor and their editorial board , @entity112 wrote @entity280 , ' f * * * him and the @entity281 ' @entity112 is unique among the committee 's investigative targets , in that his wife , @entity184 , also appears on the subpoena list			2
mrs. @entity184 was @entity7 's campaign finance director during his 2013 re-election bid			0
@entity14 's messages suggest that he was at the center of an effort to cover up the impact of the bridge lane closures , and to hide the reasons for the stunt			1
among the small batch of emails and text messages that the @entity300 was first to publish on jan. 8 was an exchange between @entity14 and @entity128 , then both @entity15 officials , after @entity128 's contentious nov. 25 testimony before @entity44 's transportation committee			1
in the back - and - forth , @entity128 asks @entity14 for ' @entity35 feedback , ' likely referring to the governor 's office			1
' good , ' responds @entity14			2
' just good ? s * * t , ' @entity128 curses back			0
' no , ' @entity280 assures him in reply , ' i have only texted @entity308 [ @entity40 ] and @entity114 [ , ] they were very happy ... both said you did great			0
' gov. @entity7 has forcefully denied having any knowledge of the bridge traffic scheme , or playing any role in directing it			0
his unequivocal statements have set up a political scenario where a single email , text message or statement to the contrary could sink his chances of winning the @entity219 presidential nomination in 2016 .			0

former official @entity14 allegedly caused four days of @entity17 delays as *punishment* for a @entity241 mayor
