it is estimated that around 8,000 people are killed by landslides every year , while many others narrowly escape the terrifying ordeal			1
but now a new way of predicting landslides has been developed – and it uses a system of fibre optic sensors to act as the ‘ nervous system ’ of slopes			1
the technology can detect small shifts in soil slopes and could be used over large areas to detect potential landslides before they threaten people ’s lives and livelihoods			1

here , mud surrounds a building after a fatal mudslide in the western @entity27 state of @entity28 on july 30 , which was caused by torrential rain optical fibre sensors are commonly used to monitor the condition of infrastructure such as the exterior walls of tunnels , dams , pipelines and railways in remote rural areas , which are difficult for humans to observe			1
in this case they can be used as the sensing element , but can also be used as a means of relaying signals from a remote sensor to the electronics that process the signals			0
the fibres can measure strain , temperature or pressure so that the quality being measured - movement for example , - varies the intensity , wavelength or transit time of the light in the fibre			2
now , @entity61 researchers have embedded optical fibre sensors in shallow trenches within slopes to detect and monitor both large landslides and slow slope movements			1
landslides are a collapse of a mass of earth or rock from a mountain or cliff and are always preceded by ‘ pre-failure strains , the researchers from the @entity68 said			2
optical fibre sensors are used to monitor the condition of infrastructure such as the exterior walls of tunnels , dams and pipelines , which are difficult for humans to observe			1
they have now been proved to be effective when embedded in slopes , where they can monitor movement of soil			2
a stock images of fibre is shown landslides are described as the mass movement of rock , soil or debris down a slope of land			2
they can destroy houses and bury people in seconds with little or no warning			0
landslides are thought to have increased in frequency because of human activity , which causes the ' failure ' of soil or rock that make up a hillside			2
earthquakes : plate tectonics move the soil that covers them , so when earthquakes strike on or near steep slopes , it is common for soil to slip and trigger landslides , according to the @entity115 – @entity116			2
natural disasters : volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are among the natural events that can cause landslides			0
heavy rainfall : slopes can become saturated with rainfall , causing landslides			0
this risk increases if trees have been cleared because there is no network of roots to support the soil , which simply washes away			0
earlier this month , a landslide in @entity28 state , @entity27 was caused by monsoons , leaving 17 people dead and many more trapped			0
in august , more than 40 people were killed when huge landslides in @entity137 , @entity138 , destroyed homes when mountainsides collapsed in wet weather and tonnes of mud buried people living in the suburban neighbourhoods below			2
mining : blasting techniques can cause vibrations under the soil , which can trigger landslides			0
the @entity150 occurred in 2013 and trapped 83 people in @entity152			0
it was one - and - a - half miles ( 3km ) long			0
while the magnitude of pre-failure strains depends on the rock or soil involved , they are measurable			0
the new technology can detect small shifts in soil slopes , and can therefore detect the onset of landslides			1
electrical sensors have been used for monitoring landslides , but they are easily damaged , unlike optical fibre sensors which are more robust , economical and sensitive			1
professor @entity167 , of the university , said : ‘ distributed optical fibre sensors can act as a “ nervous system ” of slopes by measuring the tensile strain of the soil they ’re embedded within			1
’ he explained that his team have combined several types of optical fibre sensors housed in a plastic tube , which can move under the force of pre-failure strains			1
using the technology , experts will be able to monitor the movement and bending of the optical fibre remotely to determine if a landslide is imminent			1
professor @entity167 said that the use of the fibre optic sensors overcomes limitations of other types of sensor because they have no moving parts and ‘ can withstand larger soil deformations ’			1
‘ these sensors can be used to cover very large areas - several square kilometres - and interrogated in a time - continuous way to pinpoint any critical zones , ’ he added			2
he believes that based on tests so far , the technology has the potential to be developed into a new tool to monitor areas at risk of landslides and to develop early warning systems sensitive to small movements of earth or rock			1
a major landslide can completely erase houses within seconds , as well as wiping out families and communities			0
the researchers hope that their invention will prevent loss of life just as hurricane tracking can prompt coastal evacuations and save lives			0
the findings of the initial test will be presented at the @entity224 ’s annual meeting , frontiers in @entity225 , in @entity226 next month			0

here , the remains of a house can be seen after a mudslide near @entity243 in @entity244 this march , when 43 people lost their lives when a portion of an unstable hill collapsed based on tests so far , the reseracers behind the technology think ithas the potential to be developed into a new tool to monitor areas at risk of landslides and to create early warning systems sensitive to small movements of earth or rock			1
here , rescue workers look for missing people after the @entity243 landslide in @entity244 , @entity261			0

*scientists* at the @entity68 , @entity61 , embedded a network of fibre optic sensors in a slope to prove they can monitor the movement of soil
it can detect very small movements and can be used over large areas
technology could be used to predict landslides - potentially saving lives
around 8,000 people are killed by landslides every year
optical fibre sensors are commonly used to monitor the condition of hard - to - reach infrastructure such as tunnels , *bridges* and pipes
