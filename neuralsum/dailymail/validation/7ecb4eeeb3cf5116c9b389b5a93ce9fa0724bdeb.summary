@entity1 manager @entity0 has again criticised referee @entity2 for his handling of saturday 's @entity5 defeat by @entity6			1
the @entity1 , currently in ninth place in the @entity8 , were beaten 3 - 1 by the @entity6 at the weekend in a contentious contest			1
@entity0 felt that @entity6 striker @entity10 , scorer of two goals at @entity12 , before being sent off in the 69th minute , should have been dismissed by @entity2 in the first half for persistent fouling			1
@entity10 was sent off for @entity6 during the 3 - 1 win against @entity1 on saturday @entity0 was frustrated that @entity10 was not sent off earlier in the game @entity0 said : ' the biggest problem for me was that @entity10 should n't have been on the field , not only because of persistent fouling but the level of his fouling			1
' @entity2 , whom i have a lot of respect for , is a very good referee , but he was too lenient with @entity10 by telling him ' that 's your last chance ' after the first booking			1
' in that particular instance , @entity6 have been let off			2
@entity2 has a massive responsibility on the fact that ( @entity10 ) was one of the main reasons why @entity6 won			1
' and for me that is something disappointing			0
the fact a referee warns a player for a tackle he has just made , which normally gets a yellow card , and yet he is only warned because he has just had a yellow card			0
' @entity10 climbed highest to open the scoring for the visitors in the first half with a header @entity10 got his second and @entity6 's third when he glanced a header past @entity48 palace captain @entity49 was caught on @entity51 tv cameras apparently elbowing @entity52 as they both challenged for the ball in the closing stages			1
though the incident was not seen at the time by the match officials , the @entity56 have since charged the player with violent conduct – and @entity6 have until tuesday evening to appeal against that decision			1
@entity0 has welcomed any retrospective punishment , saying that the @entity65 midfielder deserves a ban for acting in a dangerous manner against the @entity69 striker			1
he added : ' @entity49 was clearly in a position where @entity2 could n't see it			2
i think about how dangerous it was			0
it was a very dangerous thing he did			0
he could have seriously injured @entity52			2
and he will have to take the punishment – because i think he deserves it			2
' @entity49 has been charged by the @entity56 with violent conduct after catching @entity52 with his elbow the incident went unpunished during the game but @entity49 was retrospectively charged elsewhere , in his pre-match press conference , ahead of the visit of @entity85 to @entity86 tomorrow night , @entity0 spoke about the chats he enjoyed with @entity88 , the former @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity93 enforcer , who died aged 80			1
@entity0 said : ' i knew @entity88			2
he lived in around @entity95 , when i was at @entity96 for three years ( 1997 - 1999 )			0
i spent many a good night with him talking away about his time in football , about management			0
' it 's a sad day			0
he was a terrific guy not just a terrific a footballer			0
in life , you take a lot of things from a lot of people			0
' if you want to get better , you do n't just read a book or do a masters ' degree at university ; you learn a lot from listening to the experiences of people who have been great in their own careers			0
