uninspired @entity0 sorely missed star striker @entity1 as the defending champion drew 0 - 0 with lowly @entity3 in the @entity5 league on friday			1
@entity6 usually plays on the wings when @entity1 is in the starting lineup			1
but the @entity11 striker 's absence because of a left oblique muscle injury allowed @entity6 to play as a center forward , his favored position			1
@entity6 had two clear - cut chances			1
he collected a through ball from @entity17 in the 27th and cut inside two defenders but was denied by @entity3 goalkeeper @entity20			2
@entity17 fed @entity6 again in the 71st but @entity20 stopped the powerful attempt from the @entity23 striker ordered off : @entity0 midfielder @entity24 leaves the pitch after receiving a red card against @entity3 off you go : referee @entity28 shows the red card to @entity24 during @entity0 's 0 - 0 draw away to @entity3 safe hands : @entity0 goalkeeper @entity32 ( left ) catches the ball as @entity34 ( centre ) looks on strike : @entity0 forward @entity6 ( right ) has a shot on goal as @entity39 tries to block it challenge : @entity42 ( left ) is tackled by @entity3 's @entity43 ( right ) during the match in @entity45 the hosts could have won the match in stoppage time			1
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity32 tipped @entity3 substitute @entity49 's drive over the bar			0
from the subsequent corner , a block from @entity34 prevented @entity3 defender @entity43 from finding the net			0
@entity0 was reduced to 10 men in the 63rd when @entity24 was sent off			2
the @entity56 midfielder was booked for a cynical foul on @entity3 forward @entity58 in the 17th before receiving a second yellow card for tripping substitute @entity61			0
' when you receive a red card , you usually lose , ' @entity32 told @entity65 television			0
' we do n't concede any goal and we take one point , so it 's positive			0
' @entity0 has five points from its first three league games while @entity3 earned its first point this season after losing its two previous games and conceding a total of nine goals			0
kung fu fighting : @entity0 's @entity79 defender @entity78 averts danger as he clears the ball in the air : @entity3 's @entity84 defender @entity43 ( right ) challenges @entity0 midfielder @entity17 heads : @entity0 defender @entity42 ( left ) and @entity3 's @entity88 forward @entity58 jump for the ball hands on : @entity17 ( left ) is put under pressure by @entity3 's @entity92 as both sides try to break the deadlock watching on : @entity0 coach @entity95 ( centre ) stands on the sidelines as he watches his side claim a point			2
