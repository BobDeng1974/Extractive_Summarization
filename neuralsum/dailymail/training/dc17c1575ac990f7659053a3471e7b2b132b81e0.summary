last night saw @entity1 return to our screens for the tenth series			1
the first episode of the business - minded reality show saw the contestants battle it out in a classic selling task , with contestants given products from opening tasks over the past decade to hawk			1
this series will see 20 competitors fight for the position of sir @entity18 's apprentice and the £ 250,000 investment prize , and the debut episode has already showcased some feisty female characters as women 's team @entity22 secured the first win			1
@entity32 forwent her place in the finals after deciding to leave the competition in the penultimate episode as she was concerned about making time for motherhood			2
since her appearance on the reality show @entity32 has remained one of the most famously outspoken celebrities of the moment , regularly making appearances on this morning to offer her opinion on controversial subjects including ' common ' children 's names and why the obese are unemployable			1
@entity32 famously embarrassed herself when she claimed that she did not like ' geographical names ' when appearing on this morning to claim that names are linked to class			2
@entity59 then pointed out that her own daughter was called @entity61			2
@entity32 has also come head to head with several celebrities including , the late @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			2
where is she now ? @entity32 works is carving out a career as a reality star , tv pundit and columnist			2
@entity73 ( right ) was a favourite to win but lost to fellow female contestant @entity75 and @entity32 ( left ) made the decision to leave the competition to concentrate on motherhood @entity73 age : 36 series : two , 2006 place : second remembered for ... losing out : aside from earning herself the memorable nickname of @entity84 , due to her headstrong management techniques , @entity73 was mainly heralded as ' the one who should have won			1
' @entity73 lost to her fellow female competitor @entity75 back in 2006 leaving fans of @entity84 outraged and disappointed			1
although @entity84 did not technically win she showed that she was no loser either : her consultancy firm made £ 1million the same year			1
@entity73 has since hosted her own television show , an alternative to @entity93 called @entity94 , starring herself as an expert panelist			0
where is she now ? @entity73 is still running her own consultancy firm , @entity73 consultancy			0
@entity75 age : 35 series : two , 2006 place : first remembered for ... an unhappy ending : @entity75 successfully beat favourite @entity73 back in 2006 and claimed the position of sir @entity18 's apprentice , but her glory was short lived			1
@entity75 started dating fellow contestant @entity107 and fell pregnant once the show had finished			0
shortly after her win @entity75 stepped down from her role at sir @entity18 's firm following a series of emotional and physical setbacks , including exhaustion , the unexpected pregnancy and then - sadly - a miscarriage			1
where is she now ? @entity75 has recently beaten an ongoing battle with skin cancer and is working across several projects			0
@entity75 ( left ) tragically had to leave her position as sir @entity18 's apprentice after a miscarriage and @entity123 ( right ) is best known as the bad girl of series five @entity123 age : 26 series : five , 2009 place : third remembered for ... being the bad girl : from episode one , we saw her dragged regularly ( kicking and screaming ) into sir @entity18 's ' boardroom ' , hectoring her rivals , fighting her corner and making excuses when things went wrong			1
she was reportedly hugely unpopular with fellow @entity139 contestant , @entity139 saying : ' she 's a nightmare to work with - a pit bull			1
' in one of the tasks she was set - to sell a selection of tacky goods on a shopping channel - she performed so well she was accused of cheating			0
when she notched up huge sales of polyester ponchos , it was alleged she 'd phoned her family and persuaded them to buy a consignment - something she emphatically denies			0
perhaps her most shocking move was when she received a dressing down from sir @entity18 after he disapproved of her treatment of @entity157			0
where is she now ? @entity123 is currently working for herself as ceo of company @entity160 which she founded in 2011 @entity162 age : 34 series : six , 2010 place : first remembered for ... losing it all : before landing a £ 100,000 job with lord @entity168 worked as a £ 80,000 - a - year bank trader			1
she enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with £ 600 meals of lobster and caviar , £ 300 designer shoes and three homes reportedly worth £ 1million , however @entity177 now claims that she lost everything in a legal battle with sir @entity18			0
three years after her win @entity177 took sir @entity18 to court at an employment tribunal			1
@entity177 claimed the prize job was a sham and that she was no more than an ' overpaid lackey '			0
she lost the case - since it emerged she could n't prove that she had uttered a word of complaint about her role before resigning - and was roundly trashed by her former boss , who accused her of being a ' money - grabber ' and ' not a nice person '			0
where is she now ? @entity177 is now working for @entity194 , the world 's first crowdfunding tv channel @entity177 ( left ) attempted to sue sir @entity18 after she claimed that her first prize job was all a sham and @entity198 ( right ) has dabbled in a second round of reality tv when she appeared on celebrity big brother @entity198 age : 27 series : nine , 2013 place : second remembered for ... fame hunting : the 27 - year - old came second to fellow female contestant @entity207 after her pitch to open an online baking supplies company failed to win over the judges			1
however , this did not stop @entity198 from making her name known in the business sector as well as pretty much every other industry			0
since her appearance on the show @entity198 has landed several modelling campaigns including those for @entity219 and her own collaboration with swimwear range @entity221 which have both seen @entity198 posing in her underwear			0
@entity198 also tried her hand at a slightly more laid back reality tv show when she joined the thirteenth series of celebrity big brother where she finished fourth overall but not before revealing that she was bisexual and had been treated for a sex addiction			1
where is she now ? @entity198 has recently become engaged to her @entity233 millionaire boyfriend @entity232 who proposed to her earlier this week in @entity234			0
@entity207 won sir @entity18 over and bagged first place over her competitor @entity198 , despite the fact that sir @entity18 was n't initially keen on her business idea @entity207 age : 26 series : nine , 2013 place : first remembered for ... convincing lord sugar : @entity207 reached the finals of last year 's apprentice with much ease , remaining a favourite to win from early on in the competition			1
however , at the final @entity198 's online bakery almost stole the crown from under her nose after @entity18 seemed to take offense to @entity207 's pitch of a @entity256 clinic			2
when discussing a potential winner with his business aids @entity157 and @entity259 stated : ' as far as @entity207 is concerned , she does n't look like she wants to listen			0
it 's all very well being adamant about what you want to do but she will need to listen			2
' the odds looked as though they were in @entity198 's favour however , @entity207 was determined to win and a powerful ending speech seemed enough to convince @entity259			1
the 24 - year - old said to the business mogul : ' i think i 'm first of all , pitching a fantastic business opportunity , completely unique and it 's extremely lucrative			2
' and also , you 're investing in me as a person and i genuinely think i 'm a dependable , trustworthy person to invest in			0
and i really think that this is a fantastic opportunity for you and myself			0
' it was n't long before @entity259 was pointing his finger at @entity207			0
where is she now ? @entity207 currently runs her own cosmetics clinic , dr @entity207 , in @entity279			0
