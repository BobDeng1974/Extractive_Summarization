there has been contact between @entity2 and @entity3 about a possible return to the team that nurtured his genius			1
for now the interest on both sides is tentative			2
he is just one of three drivers , along with @entity12 and @entity13 , they would consider signing			1
@entity12 , as we reported here a few weeks ago , is the favoured option , though that is more likely to come about for the 2016 season than next year			1
on track : @entity3 , taking part in practice on friday , may consider a move back to former team @entity2 flying the flag : @entity3 won his maiden @entity25 title with @entity2 in his second season , back in 2008 the year 's delay would give him time to evaluate how @entity2 's new relationship with @entity29 is working , and save @entity2 from paying his gigantic salary – he is on £ 17million at @entity31 – during @entity29 's first season , when the emphasis will be on development rather than winning the world championship			1
but is the notion of @entity3 returning to @entity2 pure fantasy ? there would certainly be a space available to accommodate him ( or indeed @entity12 or @entity13 ) , with either @entity41 or @entity42 making way			1
@entity41 has not yet had long enough to prove he is a driver of the very top rank , while there is an acceptance among the team 's hierarchy that @entity42 is a tenth or two shy of the best			1
there are two possible reasons i can think of why @entity3 would want to return			1
the first is that @entity29 - powered @entity2 have title - winning form			1
the second hinges on how this season works out at @entity57			2
if @entity3 were to lose the title to @entity58 , imagine the trauma that would accompany that outcome			1
it is easy to imagine he would feel increasingly unloved , prompting a souring in his relationship with the team			2
suddenly , he would not be able to get out of the place fast enough			2
in demand : @entity2 are courting @entity12 's services - the @entity68 is in his fifth season at @entity31 an interesting interview appeared in @entity73 's @entity72 newspaper the other day			1
they managed to speak to @entity75 , the prominent karting manager , who was team boss of @entity77 and @entity58 at @entity78 – @entity79 @entity2 – in 2000 and 2001			1
what he perceived in them then is a variant of the @entity85 line : give me a child of seven and i shall show you the man			0
' @entity3 was faster , ' he said			1
' @entity90 has always worked harder , done all the dirty work on the set - up , working with the mechanics and engineers			0
@entity3 has never worked behind the scenes as hard as @entity90			1
' pictured together : @entity58 and team - mate @entity3 penned autographs at a signing session on thursday he elaborated on the theme , saying : ' @entity3 has lived for a time up in the stars			1
his management are not very helpful in this regard			0
they may be good for a @entity104 star , but not for a @entity25 driver			2
these people give him the feeling of being a superstar			0
but a motorsport race is not a show			0
this is hard work , and you have to concentrate			0
' as for @entity3 's mindset , @entity75 said : ' nothing is ever his fault			1
he always thinks others want to harm him			0
' you have to understand @entity3 ' position			1
he is in a @entity73 team with a @entity73 driver who has also worked three years with the people there			2
it might feel to @entity3 that the team is a bit friendlier to @entity90 because they have known him for so long			1
that means more stress for @entity3 because he never feels like a solid family member			2
' fax machines are still in vogue at @entity132 's @entity131 offices			2
emails are for the staff , not the boss			0
so it was not surprising to read his reaction to the notion that @entity25 should embrace new media to offset the decline in tv audiences			0
' it matters obviously , but when you say it is falling , it is changing , ' he said			0
' but i think the change that place will be very short - lived , as these social media people are starting to think it is not as good as they thought			0
' writing is on the wall : there is an opportunity for @entity132 , and @entity25 , to generate money from social media asked by @entity159 whether he believed @entity25 should change tack , he replied : ' no. we 're commercial			0
if they find people to pay us then i 'll be happy			0
' the advocates of social media say , probably rightly , that young people 's viewing habits are radically different from the older generations			2
children have smart phones and can watch short clips of action that would potentially attract them to the sport			0
that could then encourage them to watch it on tv			0
there is also an opportunity for @entity132 , and @entity25 , to generate money directly from social media			0
other sports , notably in @entity182 , have struck lucrative deals for websites to show clips of action			0
what is so unattractive to @entity132 about that ?			0

@entity12 and @entity13 are also options for @entity2
@entity31 's @entity12 is the favoured driver , but that would **n't** happen until 2016
@entity3 may consider a move to @entity2 if @entity58 wins the title
@entity42 and @entity41 are **n't** *assured* of a seat next year
