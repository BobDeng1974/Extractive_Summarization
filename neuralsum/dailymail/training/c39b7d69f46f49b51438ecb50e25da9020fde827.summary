a frustrated estate agent has taken a unique approach to selling a run - down three bedroom house - by blaming the property 's less than sparkling appearance on ' some scumbag tenants '			1
the modest house in the city of @entity8 , western @entity9 , was on the market for $ 109,000 before it was sold to a family who were ready to take on the challenge			1
a strikingly honest advertisement for the ' do - er up - er ' on website @entity14 called the property a ' redecorator 's delight '			2
estate agent @entity19 told @entity20 her advertisement was a ' one off ' and she wrote it in that way because ' it had been trashed ' by ' squatters ' who refused to pay rent			1
honest : this small three bedroom house in @entity8 , western @entity9 , was given a very frank advertisement trashed : one of the bedrooms ( left ) appears dingy and dirty			1
two windows in the living room were smashed and the wooden floor was covered in marks ( right ) ' very solid 3 @entity33 with tiled roof - which has been trashed by some scumbag tenants			2
it 's being sold " as is " and it needs redecoration , ' the advert reads			0
on the upside , it states : ' other than replacing a few cracked or broken windows , all the work needed could be done by anyone who is a bit " handy "			0
' the pictures of the property that accompany the ad show its washed out walls and dirty looking cream curtains that are only half hanging on their rails			0
telling it how it is : estate agent @entity19 said her advertisement was a ' one off ' the outdated cupboards have been stripped bare , the wooden floor in the living room looks marked and dirty , and the white bathroom floor also appears to be still muddy			1
' it is a home which has had a second living room added to it and prior to the aforementioned tenants from hell , this was a delightful little home in a quiet court , very close to the golf course , ' the estate agent said			1
' it has a double garage and can be purchased as it stands for only $ 109,000 ... it 's an excellent " do - er up - er " , ' she added			2
' @entity73 's delight ' : the advertisement for the ' do - er up - er ' was published on website @entity14 outdated : even after the kitchen had been scrubbed up it still needed some serious redecoration @entity79 : the white bathroom floor looked dirty ( left ) and dirty curtains were left hanging off their rails ( right ) ms @entity19 said the unwanted tenants had been in the house for ' some months '			1
' i think it started out as someone who was a friend of the owner who went to work over in @entity89			0
but then they left and then another lot moved in and they did n't pay rent , ' she explained			0
' after a while nobody knew who was living there and they just trashed the place			0
' frustrated : ms @entity19 said the unwanted tenants had been in the house for ' some months ' ruined : there were dozens of marks on the purple wall of one of the bedrooms ms @entity19 said they did not have to get anyone to evict the squatters because the owner ' got them out in the end '			2
despite the honest advert , the estate agent said she had ' a lot of inspections and interest ' in the property			1
' it 's been sold now and the people that bought it have done a great job at doing it up			0
' happy ending : the property now has new owners and they 've given it the redecoration that it needed			0
