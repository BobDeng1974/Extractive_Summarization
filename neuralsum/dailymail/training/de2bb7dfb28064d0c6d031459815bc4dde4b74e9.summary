time to deliver for @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 @entity5 targets @entity7 place this could be comeback year for the newly engaged @entity10 by @entity11 published : 17:40 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 20:04 est , 6 january 2014 for five elite golfers , this year looks particularly laden with significance			1
all five have reached a crossroads in their glorious careers			0
what lies ahead is a season where dreams will be realised or doubts will really start to surface as to whether they will reach the summit of their ambition			0
five reasons , then , why this will be another compelling year for intrigue			2
straight and narrow : @entity0 hits a ball across the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 @entity0 being generous , you could give him a free pass over the fact that he was never a contender at last year 's majors			1
they did n't set up well for him - and he did win five other tournaments to reclaim his position as the best player in the world			0
this year , three of the majors are at courses where he has won in the past and the @entity46 takes place at @entity48 , where he finished second in 2005			1
if he does n't win this year , he will fall off the pace regarding @entity52 's all - time record haul of 18 majors for the first time			1
in other words , no majors this year and catching @entity52 will recede into the realms of the outlandish			2
@entity1 never mind winning that elusive first major			1
right now he faces a heck of a fight simply to make @entity63 's @entity7 team			1
the clear back - marker among the serious contenders for @entity67 in september , the 40 - year - old has slipped to 25th in the world and has n't won a tournament for 18 months			2
another season like last year and the @entity71 will be struggling to stay in the top 50			2
a year like no other coming up , then			2
let 's hope it brings the best out of him			0
right time : @entity2 has chance to complete the career @entity79 slippery slope : @entity1 must rediscover his form and fast @entity2 in 1999 , the @entity46 was at @entity48 and @entity2 finished second - then became a father for the first time the following day			1
this time , he will celebrate his 44th birthday on the day following the event in mid-june			2
the storied @entity86 venue could have been built with @entity2 's game in mind			1
and so , if he is ever to complete the career @entity79 and win his first national title after no fewer than six runner - up finishes , it has to be this year			0
@entity3 the previous year ended not only in a victory in @entity94 for the @entity95 but also saw him the most content he has been in ages in the arms of his new love			1
a big ask , we know , but can the sweet senorita who carried his clubs that week also carry off the part of psychologist and keep the moody , mercurial one in a happy place during the four majors ? born in the same year as @entity109 and @entity110 , this has the feel of a now - or - never year if he is to follow their recent examples			1
focused : @entity4 believes he can win his first major this year happy days : it could be now or never for @entity3 @entity4 the popular @entity71 will celebrate his 38th birthday later this week and do so at the top of the @entity7 qualifying charts after his marvellous finish to last year , but he 's still smarting over his failure to muster a victory in 2013			1
@entity4 truly believes he can put that right and then some this year and win his first major - and you can see where he is coming from			1
the stars may never be more perfectly aligned for him than they are in 2014			0
' the world 's most interesting golfer ' is the accolade that a leading @entity130 website paid last week to the colourful @entity95 , @entity5			1
he 's certainly among the most remarkable			0
who gave him a prayer at his time of life of recovering fully from a serious skiing accident this time last year ? yet here he is , celebrating his 50th birthday at the @entity139 's calendar year opener in @entity140 this week by targeting a @entity7 place - and why not , having won as recently as last month in @entity142 ? he 's living proof that a man who can putt will give any golfing gym rat a run for his money			1
content : @entity10 watches @entity150 practice in @entity151 , @entity152 @entity10 silences sirens in his head three months ago , we talked about the siren voices in @entity10 's head that were preventing him from playing properly			2
since then , he 's set about quietening them one by one			0
resolving a court case with @entity160 ? check			0
sorting out some swing issues and restoring confidence ? check			0
feeling content away from the course and shutting up those malicious @entity166 newspaper gossip columnists once and for all ? check			0
i 've written before about my belief that this will be the year of the comeback for the newly engaged @entity10			1
it is one that we should all eagerly anticipate			0
quote of the week ' i mean , it 's just like anyone else 's grandad			0
just he played golf for a living			0
' @entity179 , one of the stars of the @entity182 college football team , gets asked about his relative			0
and the grandad in question , who just played golf for a living ? @entity52 .			0
