by @entity0 published : 03:44 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 06:18 est , 2 may 2013 one of @entity3 's top prep schools has brought in an unofficial ban on ' best friends ' in case other children are left hurt and ostracised			1
pupils at the Â£ 4,500 - a - term @entity10 's private day school in @entity11 should instead have ' lots of good friends ' to maintain harmony in the classroom			1
headteacher @entity10 believes that having best friends leads to possessive relationships and more tearful fall - outs at school			1
concerns : the head at @entity10 's private day school in @entity11 , @entity3 , believes that having best friends can be damaging for young children mr @entity10 maintains there is no official policy on the matter , but some parents claim they have been told their child should not have a best friend			1
' there is sound judgment behind it			0
you can get very possessive friendships , and it is much easier if they share friendships and have a wide range of good friends rather than obsessing too much about who their best friend is , ' mr @entity10 told the @entity41			1
' i would certainly endorse a policy which says we should have lots of good friends , not a best friend			1
i would be happy to make it school policy , although it would need to be age - appropriate			1
' by the time they are 11 , 12 or 13 they are making up their own minds			0
but when they are aged between four and ten , it would be helpful for parents , teachers and children			2
' mr @entity10 said that the problems linked to having best friends were particularly problematic when it comes to young girls			2
they often have ' triangle ' friendships where one child ends up being left out and upset			0
critics : experts say that it is impossible to stop children choosing best friends and that it is important socially for them to deal with emotional knocks the issue of banning best friends has been discussed by teaching experts , but critics are warn it is preventing youngsters from learning about the ups and downs of life			2
educational psychologist @entity83 , who provides counselling for children in @entity3 , said at a conference last year that teachers should not be interfering with friendships and that it is natural for children to want a best friend			2
' if they break up , they have to feel the pain because then they 're learning to deal with it , ' she said			0
' as parents , we 're all trying to prevent our children feeling pain , but what we should be doing is helping them bear it and find solutions , rather than trying to take it away			0
' @entity105 , also an educational psychologist , told @entity106 some schools view the policy as a waste of valuable curriculum time , while others see it as part of a holistic approach to eduction			0
national association of teachers general secretary , @entity116 , added : ' i do n't see how you can stop people forming close friendships			0
we make and lose friends throughout our lives			0

@entity124 at @entity10 's prep says pupils should have ' lots of good friends ' instead
best friends leave other children hurt and *isolated* , especially among girls
parents say there 's a best friend ban , but school says policy is unofficial
