by @entity1 reporter published : 10:51 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 : 14:55 est , 27 february 2014 with dishes piled in the sink and counter-tops stacked with rubbish , it 's going to take more than the smell of freshly baked bread and a neutral colour scheme to shift this property			1
from the outside the three - bedroom semi-detached property in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , appears respectable			1
but pictures of the interior of the house show unmade beds , a rubbish - strewn living room , piles of washing up in the sink and a filthy bathroom			1
the spacious kitchen comes complete with dirty dishes and a rubbish - strewn floor the generous lounge features camping chairs and stepladder among the debris , which the owners did n't appear to think would bother buyers the agent describes the third bedroom as being ' bigger than your normal sized third bedroom ' a traditional period style property set back off the road in need of modernisation			1
to the ground floor is a generous through lounge that could be split back into two receptions if required and access to the kitchen with a utility room towards the rear			2
to the first floor is a family bathroom and three bedrooms two of them are doubles and the third is bigger than your normal sized third bedroom			0
there is also a front and rear garden , the property is available with no chain			2
the property is on the market for Â£ 114,950 and has been listed on @entity60 by @entity62 estate agents who are marketing it as ' ideal for any private or investment purchaser '			1
the agent describes the property as a ' period style ' house featuring ' @entity68 tiled flooring ' in the vestibule and a ' generous lounge			2
' the property has a ' family bathroom ' and a third bedroom which is ' bigger than your normal sized third bedroom ' as well as being just half - a - mile from @entity76 and local shops , the website says			0
the kitchen diner is said to feature ' a range of wall and base units incorporating a one - and - a - half bowl stainless steel sink with drainer , integrated appliances to include oven , hob and microwave			0
' despite its cluttered interior , the agent has said the filth has not put buyers the wipes , rubber gloves and cleaning spray in the property 's family bathroom do n't seem to have had much use the exterior of the house is relatively respectable - although the lawn could do with a trim the house is listed on property site @entity60 , where it is described as a ' traditional period style property ' the listing states : ' a traditional period style property set back off the road in need of modernisation available with no chain			2
' to the ground floor is a generous through lounge that could be split back in to two receptions if required and access to the kitchen with a utility room towards the rear			0
' a spokesman for @entity62 said : ' we have had a lot of interest from potential buyers regarding the house on @entity14			1
' the pictures taken might make the house look messy but looking beyond that , it is obvious that the property has a lot of potential			1
' how a house should look when going up for sale sellers should make their property as neutral as possible by using a light colour scheme and keeping rooms clutter free			0
this will help potential buyers feel at home and able to imagine how they can put their stamp on it			1
natural light is important , so all curtains should be fully opened and dingy nets taken down			0
in the summer months a sense of space can be created by opening windows			0
small touches like a vase of flowers will help brighten up a room while certain smells , such as freshly baked bread can add a positive setting			0
however , strong incense and perfumed candles should be avoided as they can be overpowering and unfamiliar			0
tired kitchens and bathrooms will put potential buyers off and these should be clean and fresh - replace cupboard doors for a budget make over			1
it is important not to neglect the exterior of the house , and freshly painted woodwork and a neat garden will reassure viewers that the property has been well maintained .			0

pictures *reveal* every room covered in *discarded* clothes , food and rubbish
