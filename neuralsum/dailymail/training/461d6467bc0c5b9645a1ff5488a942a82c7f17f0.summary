by @entity0 and @entity1 there ’s a reason why two - year - old @entity4 is cuddling bunny the rabbit very tightly – and it ’s not just because she loves her more than any other toy			1
@entity8 , @entity4 ’s constant companion since she was just ten months , vanished from her side on a family shopping trip to the january sales			1
@entity4 ’s mother @entity12 only noticed @entity8 was missing when they got home			1
just how would she break the news to @entity4 that the precious gift from her grandma was gone forever ? never let me go : @entity4 is reunited with @entity8 , through the power of social media in a different age the family might have appealed for help by putting up posters around the shopping centre where @entity8 was last seen , or on lamp - posts along the route home near @entity29 in @entity30			1
instead , the power of 21st century social media - and the efforts of tens of thousands of strangers - got there first to bring bunny and @entity4 back together			1
bunny was found in a car park in @entity37 and pictures of her were posted on @entity40 in an attempt to track down the owner			0
inseparable : @entity4 and @entity8 take a nap two weeks later , after notching up more than 50,000 views online , @entity8 returned unharmed from her adventure , with a note explaining her absence			1
‘ we did n’t think we would ever get it back , ’ said miss sworn , a primary school teacher who is engaged to @entity4 ’s father @entity50 , a 35 - year - old business analyst			2
‘ @entity4 has a tendency to throw things and we ’d obviously missed that she ’d thrown it			2
‘ it ’s very treasured and it goes everywhere with her			0
we just planned to buy her another one			0
’ grand day out : @entity4 takes @entity8 everywhere - they even share a car seat ( right ) what she did n’t realise was that @entity63 , a press officer at @entity64 , was on the case			1
to the rescue : @entity63 found bunny and alerted social media after finding @entity8 in the car park , and noticing @entity4 ’s name on a tag , she alerted @entity37 - related @entity40 accounts to her find			1
the appeal was eventually forwarded on to @entity74 , a website that uses social media to match lost and found items to owners			1
one of miss sworn ’s friends saw a photo of bunny online , all perky ears and wearing her distinctive floral dress , and sent her the link			0
the family then got in touch with miss @entity63 , 30 , who volunteered to post @entity8 home			2
in a card accompanying the package she wrote : ‘ @entity91			0
here is your bunny – home safe and sound			2
we had a lovely time together – walks in the woods , jumping competitions etc. but @entity8 missed you and wanted to come home			0
’ yesterday miss @entity12 said : ‘ i let @entity4 open the envelope and she was so thrilled			0
she said : “ i love my bunny			0
” ‘ i do keep checking every day that we ’ve got her			0
we ’re going to be vigilant from now on			0

@entity4 , two , lost her favourite toy , @entity8 , on a shopping trip
but she was found by a stranger , who put the news on social media
eventually word that @entity8 was found made its way back to @entity4 **'s** family
the beloved toy was returned safe and sound , to @entity4 **'s** *delight*
