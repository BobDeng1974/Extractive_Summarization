by @entity0 published : 15:15 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 15:17 est , 7 september 2012 we know them as the warriors in horned helmets who raped and pillaged their way around @entity7			0
but when the @entity10 were not at war , @entity9 society was deeply concerned about their ‘ anti-social behaviour ’ according to experts			1
dr @entity14 , of the @entity15 , said medieval chroniclers ‘ profiled ’ notorious criminals by giving detailed descriptions of their build , hair and facial features in a similar way to today ’s police mugshots			1
a 17th - century @entity25 manuscript of @entity26 , who was a @entity28 described as having a ' lifelong interest in homicide ' after returning from treasure - grabbing raids – of which @entity33 was a particular target – there was concern that @entity28 pirates were attacking their neighbours ’ farms and going on killing sprees			0
dr @entity14 who analysed 13th century @entity25 legends , written down from stories passed down the generations , said they read like a precursor of ‘ crimewatch ’			1
one notorious warrior they describe is @entity26 , a tenth century terror who committed his first murder aged seven ‘ after what sounds like a rugby game ’ , dr @entity14 said			1
the manuscript details his full beard , bushy eyebrows , and wide forehead , ‘ very broad ’ chin and jaw and ‘ thick neck and broad shoulders ’			2
dr @entity14 said : ‘ this was text was not created so much as a record of achievement in battle , but to address what was seen as a problem at home			1
‘ a good @entity28 should be aggressive and dominant , he should go abroad , rape and pillage			2
but many of these guys end up back home and having to settle down to farming and family life			0
‘ the kind of guys who are good at rape and pillage , are not very good husbands and farmers , and the society was sensitive to a whole range of indicators of anti social behaviour			2
’ dr @entity14 , of the @entity15 claims the records of descriptions of @entity10 may be a first example of criminal profiling dr @entity14 , a historian , believes the @entity10 were aware that physical characteristics such as facial hair and muscle - now associated with high testosterone levels - were linked to aggressive behaviour			1
physical descriptions were unusual in medieval manuscripts and are usually only mentioned if relevant to the plot , or describing their dress or complexion to reflect their wealth , he said			1
but in these tales - known as the @entity25 sagas - he found a strong link between physical descriptions suggesting high testosterone , in dominant and aggressive people such as outlaws and killers			1
his study , in the journal @entity28 and @entity109 also linked individuals described as having narrow shoulders and small facial features to low testosterone behaviour , such as having straying wives or failing in battle			2
those writing the texts , thought to be wealthy farmers whose territory was at risk from raiders , were concerned with helping to spot people who might behave in violent ways			0
dr @entity14 told the @entity125 in @entity126 yesterday : ‘ these early @entity28 authors pinpointed the physical markers of testosterone , including them in descriptions of great warriors			1
‘ in this sense they were perhaps the first to begin criminal profiling			0
as a result they served as mugshots of likely offenders and a warning to wider @entity139			0
’ @entity26 was a typical warrior , who went raiding in @entity140 and elsewhere			0
he lived a long life , spending his time looting treasure , drinking , fighting and ‘ writing insulting poems ’			2
he carried out several murders in @entity25 , which dr @entity14 said was ‘ akin to the @entity148 ’ , full of young men trying to acquire land for themselves and their families often by violence			1
vikings , or pirates , originated in @entity109 , and from the years 700 to 1100 plundered their way around @entity140 , @entity156 , @entity7 and even as far afield as @entity157			0
they stepped up raids on @entity33 in the 790s to loot treasure from monasteries , and in @entity163 stormed the kingdoms of @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , before being pushed back by @entity168			0
but they came back with a vengeance , the raids continuing until the first @entity173 king took the throne – @entity175 of @entity173 in 1016 .			0

dr @entity14 , of the @entity15 , said medieval chroniclers ‘ profiled ’ notorious criminals in detailed descriptions
the @entity10 were aware that physical characteristics such as facial hair and muscle were linked to aggressive behaviour
