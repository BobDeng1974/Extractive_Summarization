foreign secretary @entity0 opened up a @entity2 split yesterday by questioning government plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes			1
he said there were concerns the scheme could lead to a rise in the smuggling of illicit cigarettes , depriving the treasury of revenue			1
his comments came a day after @entity14 finally threw his weight behind laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging bearing only grisly health warnings			1
but mr @entity0 told @entity34 5 live the issue was complex , and he would look ‘ very carefully ’ at the evidence before deciding how to vote			1
‘ it ’s a complex issue because experiments have happened around the world , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s very important to look at the evidence of those experiments and see what the evidence shows			2
‘ also some concerns have been expressed about whether it ’s going to make the counterfeiting of cigarettes easier and increasing trade , which deprives us of a lot of revenue			1
’ a packet of 20 cigarettes costs £ 8.47 on average , of which £ 6.49 is tax			1
smoke from e-cigarettes at ‘ high voltage ’ levels is more toxic than tobacco because it contains higher levels of cancer - causing formaldehyde , a study has found			2
a study found that e-cigarette smoke can contain up to 15 times more formaldehyde than traditional tobacco , though other research says that the electronic devices are safer than normal cigarettes the amount of the chemical inhaled by e-cigarette users can be between five and 15 times higher than from smoking normal cigarettes , researchers said			1
battery - powered e-cigarettes convert liquid nicotine into a mist , allowing users to inhale the drug while avoiding the harm caused by tobacco smoke , a process known as ‘ vaping ’			2
users change the voltage to decide how much vapour they want			0
the @entity88 study looked at smoke from e-cigarettes with a ‘ tank system ’ at various voltages			0
@entity93 , a chemistry professor at @entity94 who helped conduct the research , warned that e-cigarettes were not ‘ absolutely safe ’			0
colleague @entity97 said : ‘ there are toxins and some are ( there ) more than in regular cigarettes			2
‘ if you are vaping , you probably should n’t use a high - voltage setting			0
’ however the study is at odds with research last year by @entity108 which found e-cigarettes cause less harm than smoking tobacco to users and bystanders			0
other studies into e-cigarettes have been inconclusive about their dangers			0
in 2011 , mr @entity0 was treated to more than £ 1,000 worth of hospitality at the @entity118 by @entity119			1
the company , which owns @entity122 and @entity123 cigarettes , tried and failed to overturn a ban on the display of tobacco in shops introduced by former health secretary @entity128			1
medical experts say non-smokers , and younger children in particular , are likely to find plain packaging less appealing			0
@entity0 said the issue is ' complex ' and that the packaging scheme could lead to smuggling but right - wing @entity137 backbenchers see it as a ‘ nanny state ’ measure , and others are concerned it would lead to job losses			1
one law firm said plain cigarette packaging could be the thin end of the wedge , with alcohol , chocolate and fizzy drinks targeted next			0
@entity151 , head of intellectual property at @entity153 , said : ‘ this is a first foray into depriving proprietary rights to perfectly legal products to discourage their consumption			0
’ @entity159 leader @entity158 said the plan was ineffectual and ‘ counter to freedom , the basic building block of prosperity ’			0
@entity165 communities minister @entity165 admitted there was division within the government over plain packaging			1
@entity137 mp dame @entity170 said she would not vote in favour of plain packaging despite being a life - long non-smoker			0
‘ there ca n’t be anyone in this country , young or old , who does not know about the health risks of tobacco , ’ she said			2
‘ nobody smokes in ignorance			0
