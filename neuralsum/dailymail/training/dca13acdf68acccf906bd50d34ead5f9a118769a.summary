there are the first pictures of a @entity4 soldier 's letter home written on @entity6 's own personalised stationery			1
@entity7 was a 26 - year - old @entity8 sergeant when he was among half a dozen administrative clerks from the 179th @entity10 sent to occupy a @entity11 flat at the end of the @entity13			1
but this was not just any flat			0
it was one of the many homes used by the @entity6 and his girlfriend @entity18 , and was stocked with the @entity21 's very own swastika - emblazoned letter paper			1
irony : @entity7 holds a copy of his letter written on @entity6 's stationery , with a photo of himself in @entity8 uniform			1
he found the stationery in an abandoned flat in @entity11 at the end of the @entity13 and so , on may 6 , 1945 , then - @entity29 began a letter to his new wife back home in @entity33 , @entity34 , with these words : ' @entity36 , ' and so , @entity6 's treasured stationery has come to this			1
imaging how many times he would turn in his grave if he knew a jew was writing on his precious personal stationery			0
' mr @entity7 's 70 - year - old letter , penned just six days after @entity6 's suicide , is now kept for posterity in the @entity46 in @entity47 the @entity48 reports that it is now being treated by museum conservators ahead of a possible inclusion in a forthcoming exhibition of @entity53 in the @entity54			1
@entity55 , a curator at the museum , told the paper the significance of the letter is contained within its first line			2
' it 's quite unusual and ironic that he , being a @entity4 soldier , is using @entity6 's stationery , ' she said			1
but its importance proved more difficult to prove to mr @entity7 himself , who reportedly still ca n't understand why there is such a fuss about it			2
' it ’s just a letter			0
i must ’ve sent 20 others on that stationery , ' he told the @entity48 's @entity76			0
thankfully for posterity 's sake , his son @entity77 , a doctor at @entity79 's @entity78 , disagreed			2
' i had held onto the letter for the past 20 years , pretty much out of sight all that time , ' said dr @entity7			2
' but i realised the letter was an artifact and i was afraid it would get lost somehow			0
' i was nervous about holding on to it			0
' ' @entity36 ' : mr @entity7 's 70 - year - old letter , penned just six days after @entity6 's suicide , is now kept for posterity in the @entity46 in @entity47 mr @entity7 was drafted in autumn 1940 and spent most of the war as an administrative clerk as his division fought seven major campaigns from @entity95 to @entity96			1
it was the dying days of the war in @entity99 when he and his fellow admins were ordered to go to the block of flats in @entity11 , a city that had been devastated by @entity104 carpet bombing			0
he soon realised where he was , he remembered to the @entity48 , but did not consider it a particularly big deal			0
' we were just doing our job , ' he said			0
but it would have been an intensely personal job for mr @entity7 , whose @entity4 peers in @entity99 suffered mass extermination had the hands of the @entity117 regime			1
an estimated 11million people were killed in the @entity117 genocide , more than half of whom were @entity4 and including an estimated one million @entity4 children .			0

@entity7 found the letter - headed paper in a flat in @entity11
it has now been donated by his son to @entity47 's @entity46
the @entity130 are thought to have exterminated around *6million* @entity4
