@entity1 's dreams of a first @entity3 appearance are one step closer to reality after goals from @entity7 and @entity8 against @entity9 gave them a third successive @entity11 victory			1
that is the country 's best ever start to any @entity14 or @entity16 qualifying series and a table - topping nine points would surely have been beyond the most fanciful expectations of manager @entity19 following a fifth - placed finish in his maiden campaign			2
but @entity1 are a different beast now , exemplified by @entity8 's hot streak of three goals in as many games - the latest a powerful run and finish from a predatory counter-attack			1
@entity7 ( centre ) celebrates @entity1 's opening goal in their win over @entity9 at @entity33 in @entity34 @entity1 players engulf @entity8 after the striker scored his third goal in their first three @entity39 qualifiers @entity9 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 16 ' ) , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 67 ' ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 45 ' ) , @entity53			1

goals : @entity7 , @entity8 referee : @entity88 ( @entity89 ) the name of record scorer @entity92 is not taken lightly in @entity94 circles , but having led the line superbly and found the net against each of @entity98 , the @entity99 and now @entity9 , @entity90 man @entity8 is making a persuasive case to be compared favourably			1
@entity7 also deserves immense credit , opening the scoring with a deflected effort in the eighth minute and setting up @entity8 's second with a tigerish interception that turned defence into attack in an instant			1
@entity9 , though , put in a ragged impression of a top seed and former @entity112 boss @entity111 is already fighting for his job , jeered from the field after taking a solitary point in his first three matches			1
@entity111 had been afforded a muted reception in the build - up , less indeed than former @entity119 goalkeeper @entity64 on his return to @entity121			0
there were also large swathes of empty seats in the stands , meaning a far cry from the white hot reception @entity1 had been promised			0
and they capitalised by applying early pressure , pushing the hosts back into their own half almost immediately			0
@entity8 had a sight of goal as early as the sixth minute when he went toe to toe with goalkeeper @entity40 in pursuit of @entity138 's free - kick , eventually settling for a corner			1
@entity138 's first corner delivery came to nothing but a fortuitous touch from a white shirt gave him a second chance			0
this time the ball skipped through the area to @entity7 , whose scuffed connection hit @entity148 and squirmed in at the far post with @entity40 appearing to react slowly			0
@entity7 's volley from a corner took a massive deflection to sneak inside the fast post after a corner @entity19 's men in green show their elation as they take the lead against @entity9 the @entity1 fans were in fine voice , and did n't hold back with their costumes , as they turned out in force in @entity34 @entity9 's @entity48 ( front ) holds off @entity1 's @entity71 during their @entity11 @entity39 qualifier it was the perfect start for @entity19 's men and the home response was initially untidy , overhit passes and snatched shots betraying frayed nerves			1
a wonderful ball over the top from @entity48 finally caught @entity68 out but a heavy touch from @entity51 and a covering challenge from @entity67 removed the danger			0
with confidence renewed , @entity9 sprung a high defensive line in the 33rd minute , @entity49 breaking and playing in @entity46			0
@entity64 charged out of his area to meet the forward who lifted the ball over the @entity182 goalkeeper but comfortably wide			0
@entity8 finishes emphatically after a slick counter-attack under pressure from to double @entity1 's lead over @entity9 the big @entity186 ( right ) was a handful all night for @entity9 's defenders and got a deserved goal after 51 minutes when a ball was released quickly from his defence , @entity8 beat @entity192 ( right ) with ease before burying his shot @entity1 almost burgled a second moments before the half - time whistle when @entity72 's incisive pass freed @entity8			1
he did brilliantly to ghost past last man @entity43 and surprised @entity40 with a powerful strike that crashed against the woodwork			0
they did not have long to wait to establish that crucial two - goal buffer though , a predatory counter-attack finished in style by @entity8 six minutes into the second period			2
@entity9 had committed men forward having won a promising free - kick , but in the aftermath of the set - piece @entity7 gave @entity8 the chance to sprint on goal , hurling himself at a loose ball and somehow managing to pick out his team - mate 30 yards ahead			1
@entity8 had only to beat @entity192 for a one - on - one chance and he negotiated the task with aplomb , turning inside and shrugging off his man before slotting calmly into the bottom corner			2
@entity1 boss @entity19 is embraced by @entity219 after he scores his side 's second goal @entity19 celebrates with his players after they confirm their best start to a @entity225 qualifying campaign with three wins from three attempts the finish was coolness itself but an adrenaline - fuelled celebration showed how much it meant to the @entity90 striker			1
@entity8 , having now scored in all three of the qualifiers to date , was felled soon after by a rough tackle but returned to action after treatment			2
@entity9 were tepid when they needed to lift their performance , spraying the ball out of play on several occasions and producing a succession of wild attempts on goal			2
@entity47 looked likeliest to fashion a response but could not keep the ball down when he addressed two inviting free - kicks			0
@entity1 sent on three lots of fresh legs , @entity75 relieving a battered @entity8 from his duties in attack , @entity74 shoring up the left flank and @entity69 handed a high - pressure debut in midfield			2
but by the end of the match those occupying the away end were still comfortably out - singing their hosts , who only turned up the volume to boo their side - and a rattled @entity111 - off the pitch .			0

@entity1 are *undefeated* after their first three @entity39 qualifiers
@entity7 claimed the first goal after his volley from a corner took a big deflection
@entity8 was emphatic with his finish after a fast counter-attack in the second half
@entity277 now sit two points clear of @entity279 at the top of @entity11
former @entity112 boss @entity111 , @entity9 's manager , was jeered from the field
