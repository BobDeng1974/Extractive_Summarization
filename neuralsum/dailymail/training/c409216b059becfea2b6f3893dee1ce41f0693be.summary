president @entity0 will cut short his three - day trip to @entity2 and visit @entity3 to pay respects after the death of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity2 officials said saturday			1
the schedule change , announced shortly before @entity0 left for @entity2 , means the president will skip plans to see the @entity12 , and instead pay a call on an influential @entity7 ally in the volatile @entity15			1
the king , who died friday , was aggressive in trying to check the spreading power of @entity3 's chief rival , @entity19			2
@entity0 visited the ailing monarch in his desert compound last march			2
he has now cut short his three - day trip to @entity2 to travel to @entity3 to pay respects following the death of @entity27 heading east : president @entity0 and first lady @entity28 , wave as they board @entity31 before departing @entity32 , @entity33 for a trip to @entity2 stopover : @entity31 with president @entity0 and first lady @entity28 aboard departs , mr bama has canceled the end of his trip to @entity2 to fly to @entity3 in the wake of the death of its late ruler @entity44 spokesman @entity43 said the president and first lady @entity28 would travel to @entity46 on tuesday and meet with new @entity3 king @entity47			1
vice president @entity48 was to lead a @entity7 delegation , but @entity43 said the @entity44 changed plans after determining that @entity48 's trip coincided with @entity0 's departure from @entity2			1
@entity48 will remain in @entity53			0
the more substantive portions of @entity0 's trip to @entity2 appeared unlikely to change			1
@entity0 was due to arrive sunday for meetings with @entity2 prime minister @entity57 , then attend monday 's annual @entity59 festivities , which mark the day in 1950 that @entity2 's constitution came into force			1
relations between the world 's two largest democracies are strengthening after recent tensions			0
@entity0 and @entity57 developed a good rapport during the prime minister 's visit in @entity53 last fall			2
@entity57 's invitation to @entity0 caught some in the @entity7 off guard			2
tribute : @entity0 , who visited with the ailing king in his desert compound last march , praised @entity6 for taking ' bold steps ' in advancing the @entity76 ' it took us by some surprise , ' said @entity80 , @entity0 's deputy national security adviser			0
' there 's a great affinity between the @entity7 and @entity2 and our people , but there 's also a history that is complicated and that would have made it seem highly unlikely that a @entity7 president would be sitting with @entity2 's leaders at their @entity59 ceremony			2
' next in line : @entity3 state tv has announced that @entity47 will be the next @entity92 while in @entity2 , @entity0 also planned to meet with @entity57 and attend an economic summit with @entity7 and @entity2 business leaders			1
@entity0 will be the first @entity7 president to visit @entity2 twice while in office ; he also traveled there in 2010 for an economic summit			1
his trip was expected to be heavy on symbolism and lighter on substantive advances , though climate change , economics and defense ties are on the agenda			0
still , @entity7 and @entity2 officials appear to agree that even a symbolic show of solidarity would mark progress after recent difficulties			0
while military cooperation and @entity7 defense sales have grown , @entity53 has been frustrated by @entity2 's failure to open up to more foreign investment and to address complaints alleging intellectual property violations			0
@entity2 's liability legislation has also prevented @entity7 companies from capitalizing on a landmark civil nuclear agreement between the two countries in 2008			0
relations hit a new low in 2013 when @entity2 's deputy consul general was arrested and strip - searched in @entity121 over allegations that she lied on visa forms to bring her maid to the @entity7 while paying the woman a pittance			0
the official 's treatment caused outrage in @entity130 , and @entity2 retaliated against @entity7 diplomats			0
protest : activists from @entity133 hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against @entity7 president @entity0 's visit to @entity2			1
@entity0 is due to arrive in @entity130 on sunday vocal : @entity0 will be the first @entity7 president to attend @entity2 's annual @entity141			1
the banner at right reads : ' we condemn the visit of @entity7 president and stop interfering in our issues ' @entity57 's hosting of @entity0 caps a year of high - profile diplomatic maneuvers by a leader denied a @entity7 visa in 2005 , three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 @entity153 in the @entity2 state where he was the top elected official			1
the visit ties in with @entity57 's election promise that he would turn around @entity158 's third - largest economy			0
it also could send a message to @entity161 and @entity163 - @entity2 's closest neighbors and rivals - that @entity57 has a powerful ally in the @entity7			0
the @entity44 plans to push @entity2 on climate change , particularly after reaching a sweeping agreement with @entity163 on limiting carbon emissions			0
accompanying @entity0 are several @entity7 business leaders hoping to forge new partnerships with @entity2 .			2

president @entity0 will stop in @entity46 to pay respects to @entity3 *royals*
@entity0 is cutting short a visit to @entity2 to enable him to make the stop
