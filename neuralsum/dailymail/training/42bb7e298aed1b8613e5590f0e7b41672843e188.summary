@entity1 could be hit by power cuts next winter because the electricity supply is already ‘ close to its limits ’ , experts warn			1
capacity is so stretched that a cold spell , combined with routine problems at one or more plants , could overwhelm the system and see blackouts in 2014 - 15 , their damning report claims			1
a major pressure on the @entity14 is the forced closure of coal - fired power stations to meet @entity18 green directives , the @entity12 says			1
candle power : blackouts and power cuts were a familiar feature during the 1970s but the drive to low - carbon power from wind farms and new nuclear power stations ‘ will come at a cost ’ and the authors call for politicians to be honest with the public about it			1
@entity32 has promised to freeze energy prices for 20 months if @entity34 wins the 2015 general election but the report , commissioned by the prime minister ’s @entity37 , says the major power firms already lack the certainty about prices to invest in desperately - needed new capacity , and will find it difficult to secure supply in future while trying to keep bills low			1
two of the @entity49 energy firms have already announced inflation - busting price increases this winter , with @entity52 ’s 9.2 per cent rise yesterday following @entity55 ’s 8 per cent rise last week			1
@entity32 has promised to freeze energy prices for 20 months if @entity34 wins the 2015 general election for the report , engineers looked at capacity in the power network this year , in 2015 and in 2019 , and how the system would cope during a peak in demand such as that seen during the freezing winter of two years ago			1
they concluded that a combination of adverse conditions is ‘ likely to stretch the system close to its limits , notably during the winter of 2014 - 15 , increasing the chance of power outages ’			1
dr @entity74 , chairman of the working group , said these were ‘ real sets of challenging conditions that have happened before and can be expected again in the future ’			0
however , coal and gas - fired power stations are being forced to close as they do not meet @entity85 regulations on pollution , while four nuclear plants are scheduled to be phased out by 2019			1
dr @entity74 said this ‘ would reduce the flexibility of the system and increase the chances that otherwise manageable failures could jeopardise the country ’s power supply ’			1
but business minister @entity96 insisted : ‘ the lights are not going to go out			0
there will be a tightness in supply if nothing is done but stuff is being done			2
‘ we ’ve opened six new gas plants already			2
you ’re going to hear very soon about our investment in new nuclear power stations			2
’ the @entity12 experts interviewed staff at the @entity14 , the regulator @entity111 , the @entity112 and the big power firms			1
they call on ministers to build more gas plants in the coming years , but say they must urge operators not to close them before 2015 , and pay them to generate more capacity			1
ageing gas plants are being closed or mothballed because the high price of gas make them unprofitable			2
and while coal prices have plummeted , undercut as a result of the shale gas boom in the @entity126 , around a dozen coal plants will close by 2015 because of green directives			2
dame @entity128 , fellow of the @entity12 , who worked on the report , said : ‘ we ’re saying that when everything is going well there is enough capacity in the system , but if there is a bit of a problem such as one or two major stations going down for whatever reason and an anticyclone comes from over the @entity141 , then at peak , demand will potentially exceed supply			1
‘ we have quite a lot of renewable energy being installed but it is intermittent , so unless you have gas to back it up it ’s a problem			0
whether the turbines are onshore or offshore , if it ’s a cold winter that is not windy then only a very small amount of energy will be generated			2
’ possible closures : dr @entity74 , chairman of the reports 's working group , said several coal and oil - fired power stations could be closed in the next decade if there is no investment major investment is needed in the electricity network , she said , but the new wave of nuclear power stations announced today will not come online until at least 2020 – leaving a looming gap			2
‘ in the long term we will need a lot more power ’ , she said			0
‘ the important thing is before any statements are made about fixing prices there have to be decisions made about how much investment is needed and how the costs of that investment – which do not come from taxation , they come out of electricity bills – will be paid for			0
’ most of the network was built in the 1960s			0
since then the population has risen by more than 10million – and the use of electricity in transport systems and to heat homes has soared			0
dr @entity74 said : ‘ major investment is needed in the @entity1 ’s electricity system to achieve a modern , sustainable and secure service that will be the foundation of economic growth			1
at risk : leading engineers have warned the country is at a high risk of blackouts over the next five years as the ageing electrical system comes under pressure ‘ @entity112 will set the market conditions but it is private industry that will invest the necessary money			1
most of the energy companies operating in this country are international organisations that will invest in the @entity1 only if it proves to be an attractive market			2
‘ modernising and decarbonising the system will come at a cost , with likely rises in the unit price of electricity and difficult decisions will need to be made			0
it is vital that government and industry work together to foster a constructive dialogue with the public about the challenges we face			0
’ by @entity225 chief political correspondent @entity227 has signed a deal with @entity229 which opens the doors for investors to take control of @entity1 nuclear power plants @entity229 will be allowed to own and operate a new generation of nuclear power stations in @entity1 despite warnings the move is a ‘ serious error ’ that could undermine national security			1
chancellor @entity227 said yesterday he was happy for nuclear firms owned by the @entity229 state to take a ‘ majority stake ’ in @entity1 power plants			1
billions of pounds of investment is likely to follow , with @entity229 firms expected to take a major stake in the £ 14billion @entity248 reactor planned for construction in @entity250			0
but some experts have warned against giving @entity229 a controlling stake in the critical industry on national security grounds , arguing that it would leave @entity1 at the mercy of the communist regime			1
there are also concerns that the move could give @entity229 access to details about pressure points in @entity1 ’s energy supplies and other sensitive information			1
@entity265 , a @entity266 member of @entity268 ’s national security strategy committee , said : ‘ investment is needed , but not at any cost , particularly when there are national security implications			0
‘ i do n’t have a big problem with @entity229 involvement in designing and building nuclear power stations but they should not be allowed to operate them			0
‘ it would be a serious error to let them have operational control of our electricity supply			0
’ the chancellor has also faced criticism from human rights groups after failing to raise @entity229 ’s appalling human rights record with officials during a week - long visit			0
@entity1 aims to renew ageing nuclear power plants but needs foreign investment to pay the huge upfront costs @entity229 ’s state - controlled @entity294 yesterday said a @entity1 admission that it had ‘ mishandled ’ the issue of @entity297 had paved the way for a week that has seen mr @entity227 announce a string of @entity229 investments in the @entity1			1
@entity229 companies have been criticised for their lack of transparency in a survey released by an anti-corruption watchdog			0
@entity229 got the lowest rating of the five major emerging economies , behind @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312			0
‘ companies from @entity229 lag behind in every dimension with an overall score of 20 per cent , ’ @entity314 - based @entity313 says			0
‘ given their growing influence in world markets , this is of concern			0
’ firms were marked on how transparently they present anti-corruption measures and disclose data			0
the claim was dismissed by @entity327 , which said @entity1 ’s approach to @entity297 and its spiritual leader the @entity329 had ‘ not changed ’			2
mr @entity227 defended the planned investment by @entity229 , saying : ‘ there are many countries in the world who would n’t want other countries involved in their civil nuclear programme – i do , because by the way , if it was n’t @entity229 investment or @entity341 investment , it would have to be @entity1 taxpayers , and i ’d rather @entity1 taxpayers were spending their money on our schools and hospitals and those things , and let ’s get the rest of the world investing in our energy			2
’ officials insist the national security implications of extending @entity229 ’s reach in the @entity1 have been fully considered			2
@entity341 energy firm @entity357 has been negotiating with three @entity229 nuclear giants on the @entity248 project			0
initially @entity229 companies are likely to hold a minority stake in any project , but this could rise over time to a majority .			0

@entity12 warns of risk as old plants begin to close
electrical system could be under the most pressure next winter
@entity14 last week warned of @entity1 's risk of blackouts this winter
latest report *suggests* system should cover demand but will be stretched
power supply could be put at risk by low wind or even cold weather
