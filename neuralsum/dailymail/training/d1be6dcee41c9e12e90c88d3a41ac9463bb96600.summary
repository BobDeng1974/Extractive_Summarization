@entity0 and his @entity1 happened to bounce into the very @entity3 night spot in which @entity4 and his @entity5 were celebrating the dazzling victory which has drastically revised opinions of our grown - up boy from @entity10 on both sides of the @entity12			1
no words were exchanged between the parties as @entity0 breezed into a private vip area of the trendy @entity17 club in the @entity18 , the vast casino resort deep in the bowels of which @entity4 had just delivered a virtuoso performance to bewilder , bedazzle and generally box the ears off the highly respected @entity24			1
@entity0 was first to leave and @entity4 was not surprised to see him hastily depart through the fire exit			1
‘ i ’m a much better boxer now than i was then and i ’ll be even better if we do fight next may			1
‘ i ’m not the complete package yet			2
i need to make some small adjustments			2
technically , it ’s about angles in the ring			2
then there are small things like looking at my opponent instead of the referee when we ’re told to break			2
small things but they can be important if you ’re not protecting yourself at moments like that			2
’ as he spoke , the @entity58 boxing community were talking of him in the same breath as @entity0 and @entity60			1
he has complicated the debate as to which of this triumvirate of elite welterweights should fight each other next			1
he has also challenged the misconceptions of so many of his @entity67 countrymen who have taken so nastily against him			2
@entity4 , as he surveyed the famous @entity3 from the window of his penthouse suite , revealed that one of the reasons he moved his training base over here was to escape the poisonous atmosphere in some quarters back home			1
@entity4 wants to fight @entity26 ( left ) next year after proving he belongs with the world 's best @entity0 has yet to decide who he will fight when he returns to the ring on may 2 next year ‘ there have been doubters from the beginning , ’ he says			1
‘ i do n’t really know why			2
perhaps it ’s because i was successful so early			0
maybe they do n’t like that i got so much so young			0
but do they think it comes easy ? do n’t they realise all the hard work that goes into this ? i ’ve been under pressure to prove myself ever since day one as a teenager when i won my medal at the @entity93			0
‘ yet people keep having a go at me			0
is it jealousy ? ’ with the growth of social media some of the attacks have become highly abusive and @entity4 says ; ‘ that helped make up my mind to train in @entity58			1
i could n’t work in that environment of hate			0
‘ this is a tough job and i need positive energy around me , not negative			0
’ @entity4 acknowledges that some of the resentment stems from a public perception that he can be arrogant			1
he takes the trouble to explain : ‘ it is important for my self - belief going into a fight to be confident and to show it			2
’ even if he were not so preoccupied with trying to coax @entity0 into the same ring – and hopefully become the first to beat him – he would not have time to go round @entity67 showing his real self to all the knockers			1
but he wishes he could			0
‘ when people get to know me their view changes , ’ says @entity4			1
‘ i ’ve met so many on holiday or at events			0
i always give time to everyone			0
and they always end up saying that i ’m very different from the way they imagined			0
they say i ’m humble			0
’ there is a divide in @entity67 between those who recognise that @entity4 and those who flood @entity133 with messages before fights like the one with @entity24 hoping that he gets knocked out , badly hurt even			1
he says : ‘ i do n’t know what i ’ve done to be thought of and talked to like that			0
i ’m actually more down to earth than normal people			0
’ as recognition of his prowess spreads , however grudgingly , he has this to say to the merchants of hate : ‘ spend a day with me and your view of me will change			0
’ @entity4 would also relish a fan with @entity60 ( right ) after his comprehensive win over @entity149 ( left ) @entity60 celebrates his victory over @entity151 - he too is yet to announce who he will face next we who frequently spend time with this charming , courteous young man willingly endorse that message			1
to know him is to like him			0
furthermore , those who cling to prejudice against him risk missing out on a thrill ride to @entity67 glory			0
@entity162 , the iconic @entity163 of the prize - ring who is @entity4 ’s promoter , says : ‘ after @entity0 and @entity60 , @entity4 will become the greatest pound - for - pound fighter on the planet			1
’ it is no longer fantasy to imagine @entity4 proving it by beating one of them , particularly the one who was last seen heading for the fire escape in his home town .			1
