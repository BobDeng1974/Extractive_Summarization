in danger : @entity1 say they may now kill their giraffe named @entity4 a second @entity7 zoo has threatened to put down one of its healthy giraffes just days after @entity10 slaughtered one to the disgust of animal lovers			1
@entity1 said it was considering the measure against a giraffe which by coincidence was named @entity4 like the one killed on sunday , according to @entity7 news agency @entity16			1
staff at @entity10 have received death treats after the zoo killed the 18 - month - old healthy male giraffe because the animal 's genes were already well represented in an international breeding programme that aims to maintain a healthy giraffe population in @entity26 zoos			1
zookeepers at @entity1 said the act is necessary because @entity4 may fight with a younger male already at the zoo when the female arrives			1
and they insisted the death threats aimed at staff in @entity10 would not deter them			2
keeper @entity35 said : ' we ca n't have two males and one female			2
then there will be fights			0
' she said that it might be possible to find another place for the giraffe to live , but that the probability is small			0
like its namesake in @entity10 , @entity1 's @entity4 is considered unsuitable for breeding			1
' if the breeding programme coordinator decides that he should be put down , then that 's what we 'll do , ' she said			1
' many places abroad where they do not do this , the animals live under poor conditions , and they are not allowed to breed either			0
we do n't think that 's okay			0
the zoo has not yet decided whether it will carry out a public dissection			0
@entity1 in western @entity7 might put down its seven - year - old @entity4 if the zoo manages to acquire a female giraffe , which is most likely , zoo keeper @entity35 told @entity16			1
the zoo also has a younger male called @entity77			2
a lion feasts on the remains of @entity4 at @entity10 after the mammal was put down earlier in the day a crown gathers for the public autopsy on @entity4 's body captivated : children watch as the body of the giraffe is butchered in front of them the giraffe at @entity10 was dissected in front of crowds at the zoo , and afterwards , some of the carcass was then fed to other zoo animals and some was sent to research projects in @entity7 and abroad for study			1
@entity35 said @entity1 has not yet considered whether it should carry out a public dissection as the one in @entity10			2
animal rights campaigners dismissed the trend as barbaric			0
a spokesman for the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) group said : ' as if to ram home the idea that zoos serve no purpose other than to incarcerate intelligent animals so as to turn a profit , a second @entity7 zoo now proposes to slaughter a giraffe , over the world 's objections			0
' zoos spend millions on keeping animals on display like living museum exhibits and dispose of them when they become inconvenient			0
' for anyone who cares about giraffes and other individuals serving life sentences in zoos , the giraffe " culling " should confirm that zoos are hideous institutions that do not deserve public support			0
' @entity4 ( centre ) was shot with a bolt gun and will be chopped up for the other animals ' dinner the animal was deemed ' surplus ' before it was put down by zookeepers in @entity10			2

@entity134 also called @entity4 like one killed by @entity10 on sunday
zoo hoping to bring in a female giraffe as part of its breeding programme
@entity4 is *eldest* of two males , but only one can stay over fear of fighting
