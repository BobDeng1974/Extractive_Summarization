@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest instalment of his column for @entity4			2
the @entity6 boss recalls watching @entity7 play for @entity8 and praises the @entity11 manager 's achievements at the @entity12			1
@entity14 ’s @entity13 i used to love watching my hometown team @entity8 , stood on the @entity17 at their old @entity19 ground led by the their captain , @entity7			1
@entity7 , the northerner , was the first player i ’d ever seen wear a mouth guard like a @entity24 player			1
he was fit as a butcher ’s dog , a fearless tough tackler , smashing anybody in his way			2
@entity8 's @entity7 ( left ) closes in on @entity30 of @entity31 in the @entity33 third round in 1998 @entity34 led @entity11 to fourth - round @entity33 success against @entity36 at @entity37 in january stood on the terraces , as a @entity8 supporter , he was my hero			1
now in the technical area , he is writing his name into the history books at @entity11			1
@entity14 has moved and changed with the times			2
introducing top technical players like @entity47 and @entity48 , both former @entity36 players , to a team who have used their centre - forward big - boy @entity53 to feed off the second balls and knock - downs			1
@entity7 , who is now managing @entity11 , takes a strike at goal during the @entity33 tie players who have struggled in the lower divisions , now passing through midfield , they have high attacking full backs and with their team spirit , tenacity and desire , @entity36 could not cope in the @entity33			1
@entity7 is another example of the good @entity69 managers out there – just like @entity70 at @entity71 and @entity72 at @entity73			1
it can only be a matter of time before their qualities are recognised and top clubs will be fishing			1
why oh why do club owners keep going abroad and forgetting the good @entity69 managers and coaches who are out there ? @entity81 for all those @entity83 fans moaning about @entity84 , who were n’t keen on him , have now seen from afar four victories for @entity86 and just one win for their own team under @entity89			1
as a manager , if you lose your best players , it is n’t rocket science to work out you lose games			2
that happened time and again for @entity84			1
the season before last they lost @entity99 to @entity100 midway through the campaign , their best player by a mile , and their season was over			1
then @entity106 left that summer to @entity36			2
@entity84 has enjoyed a great start at @entity86 after quitting @entity83 in december countless times at @entity83 he was forced to part company with his top players and try to find new ones			1
but that did n’t stop the fans getting on his back			1
@entity83 supporters might find they regret getting their wish of getting rid of @entity84			1
it happens throughout the leagues			2
i heard a couple of weeks ago that @entity120 , the manager at @entity121 , is getting moaned at and shouted at by the supporters because the team is n’t winning			2
@entity83 picked up their first victory under @entity89 on saturday with a 3 - 0 win against @entity126 he is a top - quality manager			1
he gets his team to get the ball down and play			2
on top of that he is a humble , down - to - earth man with his feet firmly on the ground			1
like @entity84 , @entity120 has had his best players sold on but still done a fantastic job			1
@entity121 supporters beware , you do n’t know how lucky you are			2
we ’ll keep defying the critics here at @entity6 we have decided not to strengthen in the january transfer window			2
instead , we chose to reinforce all the positive messages and values that we put in place during pre-season			0
reminders of respecting each of your team - mates , respecting the staff , respecting the referees and their decisions and an ongoing focus to improve technically , individually and tactically as a team			0
@entity6 manager @entity152 has decided not to strengthen his squad in january i only have one full - time member of staff at @entity6 , our young physio @entity157 ( she ’s also our kit woman ) who stepped up from the youth team			0
two senior players , @entity161 and @entity162 , help me with the warm - ups and together with our minted part - time analyst - cum - scout @entity165 ( he ’s also our kit man ) we have built up a very strong unit with just 18 players in our squad			0
they are humble , focused and we have tried our best to do things the right way on and off the field			0
with 14 games to go , it ’s very exciting times and the predictions from all the experts that we would be challenging for only the play - offs at the time probably seemed about right			0
it ’s been remarkable , and i still think there is so much more to come			0
player i keep hearing about ... @entity181 two seasons ago , i saw @entity121 play and they had a fantastic centre forward called @entity181			1
i left @entity187 ’s @entity186 one sunday afternoon with his name in my little book marked as one for the future			0
he was quick , a good athlete and a constant threat to the opposition			0
@entity196 striker @entity181 is on the verge of reaching the @entity198 he was only around 20 or 21 at the time but knocked in 22 goals playing in @entity12 last season			1
@entity181 moved to @entity196 last summer for £ 3million – money @entity121 badly needed – and has not stopped scoring in the @entity203			0
he is now on the verge of the @entity198 with them			0
one thing i 'd change about ... the substitutes rule there are seven subs allowed in the dugout on the side of the pitch for each game and it ’s about time more of them are allowed to enter the field of play			0
if the players you have are n’t doing it on the pitch , we as managers should be able to change them			0
it could bring a whole new tactical element to the game with managers able to change more than half of their team at half - time			0
bring it on , let ’s bring them on ! @entity235 ... @entity236 @entity237 is the perfect fit playing in @entity240 ’s team			2
he likes one up front with three attacking midfield players behind , all technically excellent			0
@entity237 is good in the air , mobile , brave and mentally fearless			0
he leads the line and leads the team			0
however , i ’m sure , on the quiet , despite backing his man vehemently in public , mr @entity240 would be having a quiet chat , privately and discreetly , to try to tame his tiger			0
@entity0 says @entity240 will have had a quiet word with @entity237 after he was banned for three games mr @entity240 will be very happy with his will to win and desire , even though he has clearly over-stepped the mark a few times			0
it ’s a fine line but @entity240 is the master of man - management			0
it ’s why i think @entity237 was the best piece of business done last summer .			0

@entity7 should be on the radar of the top clubs
@entity7 was the first player i saw wear a mouth guard while playing
the @entity11 boss is writing his name into the history books
@entity83 fans could regret wanting @entity84 out of the club
