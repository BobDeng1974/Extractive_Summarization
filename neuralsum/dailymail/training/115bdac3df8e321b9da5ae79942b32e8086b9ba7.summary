' this is not the first time that ms @entity37 , 22 , has claimed that one of her children has spontaneously caught fire			1
ms @entity37 ( right ) , 22 , claimed in 2013 that her other son @entity41 had also spontaneously combusted she brought her three - month - old son @entity41 to the hospital in august 2013 and claimed he had caught fire - for the fourth time			1
doctors ran a series of tests on the boy and found that he had not spontaneously combusted , raising concerns that he may have been abused by relatives or burnt in an accidental fire			1

spontaneous human combustion ( @entity58 ) has been implied as a cause of death in a number of documented cases where burned corpses have been found without an apparent external source of ignition			0
an estimated 200 cases have been found throughout history and victims are often elderly , sick , or under the influence of alcohol , which would explain why they have not been able to escape the flames			2
puzzled scientists have come up with the ‘ wick theory ’ to explain such events			0
the theory is that the human body can become an ‘ inside out ’ candle the person ’s clothes are the wick , while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance , that keeps the blaze going			0
limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient , with the bottom half of the body being cooler than the top			0
some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed spark .			0
