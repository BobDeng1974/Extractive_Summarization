a student has told how she was forced to undergo a mastectomy aged just 19 – two years after her doctor failed to spot that she had cancer			1
@entity4 , who was 17 when she first suffered symptoms , believes her age was the reason her gp did not suspect the disease was their cause			1
breast cancer is incredibly rare in teenagers , and only four are diagnosed with it in the @entity15 each year – a chance of one in half a million			1
she said : ‘ i ca n’t help but think that if i had been an older lady who had the same symptoms my gp would have thought about cancer			2
‘ there were two years between the pain starting and eventually being diagnosed			2
‘ who knows how much the cancer could have grown in that time , i might have been able to keep my breast if it was diagnosed sooner			2
’ miss @entity4 , from @entity38 , first went to her gp in 2010 because of pain in her right breast as well as discharge , but she was told that it was an infection of the milk duct			1
miss @entity4 , 21 , from @entity38 was forced to undergo a mastectomy to remove her right breast when she was just 19 ( pictured left ) but has fully recovered ( pictured right ) miss @entity4 , pictured with her family , said she believes had her disease been detected earlier , she might have had a chance to keep her breast			1
she said she thinks her age played a part in her misdiagnosis but the pain eventually became so bad that the teenager , who was studying performing arts and was a keen ballet and contemporary dancer at the time , went to get a second opinion			1
the first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast			1
most lumps ( 90 % ) are not cancerous , but it is always best to have them checked by your doctor			0
see your gp if you notice any of the following : a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts discharge from either of your nipples ( which may be streaked with blood ) a lump or swelling in either of your armpits dimpling on the skin of your breasts a rash on or around your nipple a change in the appearance of your nipple , such as becoming sunken into your breast pain in either of your breasts or armpits not related to your period source : @entity105 she said : ‘ i could n’t dance and i kept just thinking , they said this was normal , it ’s nothing serious			1
‘ i went to a different gp and they put me at ease , explained it was probably nothing to worry about but referred me to a specialist breast clinic for tests			1
’ two days later @entity115 was told she had breast cancer			1
she said : ‘ i should have been more shocked , but i was kind of expecting it , i knew something was really wrong			0
‘ i was referred to the @entity119 in @entity120 where they have a teenage cancer unit for a lumpectomy			0
‘ but later that week i was told that the cancer was bigger than they had expected and so i had to have a mastectomy			2
‘ it was horrible news , i would have done anything to avoid that surgery			0
i was dead against it from the start , but i knew that the surgeon knew best			0
‘ the operation did take away the cancer and that ’s what ’s important			0
‘ i have had the breast reconstructed and had both things done during one operation so when i woke up it was all done			0
’ miss @entity4 has recovered from her surgery and has also undergone radiotherapy and hormone treatment			2
she is looking forward to returning to university in @entity143 this month , but said her attitude to life has changed			0
before being diagnosed with breast cancer , miss @entity4 was studying performing arts in @entity143 she said : ‘ i do n’t make plans any more , you literally never know what life is going to throw at you			1
the cancer has definitely made me a stronger person and it has taught me to accept whatever life has in store for me			0
’ her parents , @entity19 , 53 and @entity20 , 57 , are running the @entity21 this weekend to thank the @entity158 ’s @entity23 for its support in looking after their daughter			1
dr @entity161 , a consultant medical oncologist at the @entity162 in @entity120 , said : ‘ breast cancer in young women is exceptionally rare			2
the chance of being diagnosed in this age bracket is one in 500,000			0
’ she said facing the disease has changed her attitude to life			0
she added : ' i do n't make plans anymore , you literally never know what life is going to throw at you so there is n't much point '			0
