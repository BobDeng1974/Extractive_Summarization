by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 10:31 est , 1 may 2012 @entity4 fighter pilots have asked not to fly the military 's 190 @entity5 because of oxygen problems with the $ 143million stealth fighter , an @entity2 leader has revealed			1
gen. @entity9 , commander of @entity10 at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , told reporters that a ' very small ' number of pilots have asked not to fly the fifth - generation fighter jets or to be reassigned			1
' obviously it 's a very sensitive thing because we are trying to ensure that the community fully understands all that we 're doing to try to get to a solution , ' @entity9 said			2
air attack : pilots have asked not to the fly the latest f - 22 model because of fears of blacking out over lack of oxygen despite it being one of world 's most advanced top speed : above mach 2 with afterburners : greater than 1,317mph ( 2,120km/h )			1
kill ratio : @entity35 pilots demonstrated that its higher cruise altitude has given it a major combat advantage over @entity4 4th/4.5th generation fighters and have an unblemished kill ratio against other @entity4 fighters in training maneuvers			1
problems : the oxygen system was suspected as being behind a crash in which an f - 22 pilot was killed in november 2010			0
overview : the f - 22 raptor is primarily an air - superiority fighter but is also capable of ground attack and electronic warfare , and signals intelligence roles			2
despite a costly development period , the @entity2 considers the @entity35 the key component of @entity4 air power , and claims that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter			1
however its high cost , lack of clear air - to - air combat missions because of delays in the @entity64 and @entity65 fifth - generation fighter programs resulted in calls to end production			0
the final @entity5 of 187 came off the assembly line on 13 december 2011 during a ceremony at @entity70			0
he would not provide exact figures on the number of pilots who have asked not to fly the jets and said each pilot 's request would be handled individually			1
@entity2 officials insist the airplane is safe to fly - hostage noted that he 'll fly soon because he wo n't ask a pilot to do something that he will not			0
' i 'm going to check out and fly the airplane so i can understand exactly what it is they 're dealing with			0
' the day we figure out what the problem is i will stop flying ( the plane ) because we do n't have enough sorties for all of our combat aviators to get as much training as they need , ' he said			1
the nation 's f - 22 fighter jets were grounded for four months last year after pilots complained of experiencing a lack of oxygen that can cause dizziness and blackouts			1
@entity2 officials said they have taken steps against the problem , but still have n't pinpointed what 's causing the hypoxia - when the body does n't receive enough oxygen			1
stealth : @entity111 has complained about the fighters being stationed in the @entity113 an @entity2 panel is meeting weekly to investigate the problem and has enlisted the help of @entity117 and the @entity118 to learn more about what happens to the body under extreme conditions			0
hostage spoke during a media day event at the base , highlighting the nation 's most advanced fighter plane			1
after being introduced in 2005 , the last of nearly 190 jets are scheduled to be delivered to the @entity2 this week			0
at a price tag of $ 143 million each , the @entity35 has come under some criticism for not being used in place of older and less - sophisticated jets in @entity133 or @entity134			0
hostage said the plane is critical to maintaining the nation 's air superiority in the future and that he wishes he had more of the jets at his disposal			2
on monday , @entity111 's defense minister said that reports of the stealth fighter jet being deployed to the @entity147 would damage regional security , the semiofficial @entity143 news agency reported			2
without saying which country in the region the f - 22s were deployed to - or which base or bases they were deployed from - hostage said there 's a reason other nations take note of the plane 's movements			2
' people pay attention to where this airplane goes and what it does because , regardless of the furore in our press and public about the suitability or the safety of the airplane , they 're very worried about its capability			0
the planes are stationed at five other bases besides @entity13 : @entity179 , @entity180 ; @entity181 , @entity182 ; @entity183 , @entity184 ; @entity185 , @entity186 ; and @entity187 , @entity188 .			0
