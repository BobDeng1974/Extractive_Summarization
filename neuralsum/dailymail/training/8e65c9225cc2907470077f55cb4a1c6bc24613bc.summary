’ he added : ‘ they are using their celebrity and their connections to shoehorn themselves into a career for life			0
‘ politics is helping people and helping people ’s lives			0
it ’s not about an entitlement to just go and be an mp because @entity61 was too			0
i ’m not saying they should never run for office			0
i ’m saying that they should go and have a real life first			0
’ @entity33 , son of former home secretary @entity64 , has been selected to contest @entity65 and @entity66 in @entity67 , while @entity34 , son of former @entity4 leader @entity13 , will stand in the safe seat of @entity69 in @entity70			1
