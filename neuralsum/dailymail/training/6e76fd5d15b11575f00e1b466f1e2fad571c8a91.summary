by @entity0 @entity2 's tiny and diminishing frame has long been a source of speculation , and now her mother , @entity5 , has opened up about her own struggles with an eating disorder , in her explosive new memoir @entity9 , according to @entity10			1
although her daughter has publicly denied being anorexic in the past - despite jokingly referring to her ' keep your f * * * ing mouth shut ' diet - candy certainly seems to imply that deep rooted food issues run in the family			2
' once @entity2 was born , i got even thinner than i had been before i was pregnant , ' she writes , detailing how she ' deprived ' herself of food			1
' [ my husband ] @entity20 always thought i looked terrific , but i still could n’t see how i really looked			2
' i perceived an imaginary defect in my body , ' she reveals			2
' this started in my teen years , when , like most other girls , i was very preoccupied with my appearance			2
' the 68 - year - old matriarch , who has been in and out of bitter feuds with @entity2 for decades , said she went through cycles of starving herself and binging whenever things got tough in her life			1
worryingly thin : @entity2 's ( pictured in @entity47 last month ) shrinking frame has been closely scrutinized over the years , despite the star having denied she is anorexic in the past the problem worsened , @entity5 says , when her husband , director @entity50 , died from cancer in 2006			1
instead of ' reading a lot of books ' or ' taking up a new hobby ' , she fell back into her negative eating habits before finally deciding to see a psychologist			2
' i realized i had body image issues and that i was eating to comfort myself , ' she writes			2
' my relationship with food and my ability to discuss my feelings are a work in progress			0
' more @entity2 drama : @entity5 's comments could be read as implying that she has unwittingly passed her eating disorder onto her daughter @entity2 , as the condition is known to be hereditary @entity2 , who has been struggling both with marriage problems and a recent agonizing spine condition , has seemingly been supportive of her mother 's recovery			1
' [ @entity2 ] wrote me a beautiful letter in which she shared that it was painful for her to hear how critical i am of myself , ' she says			1
' children have different eyes for their parents			0
' but unsurprisingly , it looks as though their strained mother - daughter relationship may be hitting the rocks once again in light of certain revelations which have surfaced in @entity5 's explosive memoir			1
making it work ? @entity5 says their family relationship is now a ' work in progress ' , pictured here together in 2010 in it , she risks reigniting her long - running feud with her daughter by pleading to ' stop blaming your parents ' and alleging that if she did n't buy @entity2 ' extravagant gifts ' she would get cut off			1
' i also believe that there comes a time when you have to stop blaming your parents			0
take responsibility for your own actions and attitudes , ' writes @entity5			0
@entity2 wrote me a beautiful letter in which she shared that it was painful for her to hear how critical i am of myself but she does admit to not always being the perfect mother			1
' i see now that in my quest to be the perfect mother and create the picture - perfect life for my children , i was too focused on the bigger picture and not enough on the smaller brush strokes			2
i feel badly that my children felt i was n’t affectionate enough			0
i thought i was , ' she goes on			0
the mother and daughter famously fell out before @entity2 's media mogul father @entity50 's death in 2006			1
' i was devastated about @entity2 and [ @entity20 ] was angry , ' she claims in the book			1
' he left her numerous messages on her cell phone			0
i tried reaching her as well			0
not surprisingly , we did n’t hear back from her , ' she added			0
around this time , @entity2 started dating and eventually married @entity121			1
but with no communication between them , it was n't until @entity20 's funeral that @entity5 ever laid eyes on her new son - in - law			0
' it was very emotional because i did n’t know if she was going to show up			0
this was my first time seeing my new son - in - law @entity121			0
a friend of mine could n’t bear the awkwardness			0
" this is n’t right , " he said			0
' @entity135 : candy did n't meet @entity2 's husband @entity121 until @entity50 's funeral , the three of them pictured here in 2011 adding to the tension was the fact that @entity20 reportedly left his daughter $ 800,000 , a fraction of his $ 500m fortune			1
candy - who is now worth a reported $ 600m - even goes on to say that @entity2 would cut her off if she would n't lavish the former @entity148 , 90210 star with expensive gifts			1
' when i denied @entity2 an extravagant purchase , it resulted in radio silence , ' she revealed			1
@entity2 has been open about her financial struggles and how difficult it is to support four children now that her acting career has slowed down			1
family time : the matriarch said when @entity2 had her first child , they made amends , pictured here with her daughter and granddaughter @entity165 in 2011 although @entity5 claims their falling out was ' excruciating , ' everything changed as soon as @entity2 gave birth to her first child @entity170 in 2007			1
' we have never discussed that painful period in our lives when we did n’t speak , ' said the 68 - year - old			2
' we just tried carefully to move past it			0
i like to think that it was her pregnancy that paved the way for us to resolve our issues			0
' double standards : while on the today show , @entity5 revealed that watching @entity2 is ' painful ' - and in a letter she allegedly received from her daughter , @entity2 also said it was ' painful ' so see her mother struggle while they have their ups and downs , she now calls their mother - daughter relationship a ' work in progress ' adding , ' we have a pattern , and until we can break it hand in hand , this is going to be the little dance she and i do together			1
' but she says she does ' worry ' about her daughter , who suffers from migraines and ' has her hands full , ' even with several nannies			0
during an appearance on the today show on monday , the author revealed that she is watching the @entity210 docu - series @entity208 but that it is n't easy			0
' as a mom , you do n't want to see your children hurt in any way , and i have to say that it 's painful for me to watch it , ' she revealed .			2

candy also reveals in her memoir @entity220 that @entity2 wrote her a ' beautiful ' letter about how ' painful ' it is to see her mother , 68 , struggle
