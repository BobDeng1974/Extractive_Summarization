@entity0 says that she has n't had @entity1 or plastic surgery in the last three years			1
the actress revealed that she had previously used the injections in her face , but stopped almost three years ago , after the difficult birth of her daughter @entity7 in january 2012			2
she made the comments during a heated debate on today 's @entity10 with relationship therapist @entity11 , who advocates that women should get cosmetic surgery in order to stop their husbands and boyfriends cheating			1
the show 's host @entity0 was angered by the comments and revealed she has stopped using botox when @entity11 , 41 , asked @entity0 if she had previously undergone @entity1 or surgery , the actress said : ' everybody knows that in the past , yes , i ’ve talked about having @entity1			1
' since spending too much time in intensive care after nearly losing a baby , i ’ve not gone under the knife or had any injections			2
' to be absolutely honest , no different , i now have a team of amazing people and i have non-invasive stuff			0
' but i have facials , i buy things from well - known chemists , it 's not how i look physically , it ’s how my husband and how i feel about myself			0
' my husband tells me every day wonderful things			0
' @entity11 and @entity0 were joined on the @entity10 sofa by @entity46 and body image campaigner @entity48 @entity11 was on the @entity50 programme to discuss comments she had made to @entity52 last week , where she claimed that women in their forties should get plastic surgery or face their partner running off with a younger model			1
@entity11 , who runs a relationship therapy centre in central @entity59 , believes ladies only have themselves to blame if their husband starts to find other women more attractive			1
after appearing on the show , she labelled @entity0 's opinions on body image as hypocritical			1
she told @entity52 : ' when i asked @entity0 how it ( botox ) made her feel , she said it did n't make her feel any different			1
' well , what 's the point in having it ? why bother then ? i thought that was a bit hypocritical - we only do it to make ourselves feel good			0
' she and @entity0 were joined on the @entity10 sofa by @entity46 and body image campaigner @entity48			1
@entity48 argued against @entity11 's standpoint , saying : ' i find the argument quite offensive as a woman that the way i look is what i bring to a relationship			1
' however much surgery we get , old age will come to us all			2
' i think every woman is beautiful in her own way , there ’s always someone who will be conventionally more beautiful than you , but we ’re putting ourselves in this global hierarchy			0
' but @entity11 was also critical of @entity48 's stance on the topics after the programme ended			1
she said : ' it 's the same thing - she 's sitting there and has just spent hours in make - up and hair			0
' i 've seen her talking about how her lips are her best asset , when she sitting there saying it 's not about looks or appearance			0
' it 's all a bit hypocritical			0
' @entity11 , 41 , runs a relationship therapy centre in @entity59 , she believes women only have themselves to blame if their man cheats and should get plastic surgery to stay desirable @entity11 told @entity52 last week : ' i think for the people who do want to have a monogamous relationship – the women are very quick to point the finger			1
' they say that their husband is messing about and he ’s left them for someone else , but i think it is absolutely the woman 's responsibility when they have let themselves go over the years			0
' we are the creators of our own destiny , if your fella cheats , you ’ve created it yourself			0
' the men have a right to look elsewhere , they have a right to be sleeping with an attractive woman			2
' apparently it could be worse though , while @entity137 and @entity138 women are not in good shape , @entity11 reserves her harshest criticism for ladies from some of the countries on the @entity145 mainland			1
she said : ' i lived in @entity146 for fifteen years and the women there , they age because they eat all of these cakes and bread			2
' a lot of the women , when they hit 50 they are pretty much a write - off in some of those countries , but it does n’t have to be that way			2
' @entity11 provides advice for women whose men have been unfaithful steering clear of cakes and keeping in shape with regular visits to the gym is not enough though - @entity11 thinks that women should start to have breast augmentation , liposuction , fillers and the rest as soon as parts of the body start to sag			1
she said : ' a lot of my female clients in their forties and fifties come in and they ’re unhappy that their husbands are playing away but they ’ve let themselves go			0
' but no one ’s really happy with themselves when they are overweight and not looking good			0
' even when you buy a new dress you feel good – looking good is feeling good			0
' i actively encourage my clients to get plastic surgery and it ’s received fairly well			1
' i have had the odd client who think they should be accepted for who they are but some of them have taken it up			0
@entity11 believes women should look into cosmetic surgery as soon as their skin start to sag ( picture posed by models ) ' i ’ve had some ladies who have had liposuction done for their weight and some who 've had the gastric band			1
' there are also some who 've had their eyes and breasts done as well			0
' faces get saggy and a little bit of filler is good , it ’s very important that you find the right surgeon though			0
' some of the @entity214 girls go totally over the top and they begin looking like this plastic			2
it does n’t have to be like that			0
' if you have a good surgeon , they ’ll do it the right way			0
' @entity11 claims to have had serious success with her pro-plastic surgery approach to healing marriages			1
but sometimes the effects can be so strong that the balance in the relationship swings completely the other way			0
@entity11 thinks that men should be allowed to look elsewhere if their partner has let themselves go she said : ' this one woman had a boob job and it gave her a totally new lease of life			1
' she decided that as her husband had cheated on her , she was going to go off anyway			0
' i take my hat off to those types of women as well because i think that maybe they had been staying in the relationship because they had settled and could n’t get anyone better			2
' while @entity11 acknowledges that her comments may seem harsh and quite extreme , she is quick to point out that she practises what she preaches and has undergone extensive cosmetic surgery herself			1
she said : ' people say to me it ’s easy because i am a natural beauty but i work really hard to look like this			0
' i decided that in my fortieth year i wanted to be the fittest i ’ve ever been , so i had my boobs done			0
' i first had them done eight years ago , back then i was a @entity257 and went up to a @entity258 and now i ’m a 34 @entity259 ' i also had under my eyes done – i had the wrinkles taken out , i ’ve also had my lips done			0
' everybody says that they ca n’t believe i ’m 40 , they all think that i look like i ’m 30 and that ’s a great feeling			0
' i do n’t believe in growing old gracefully			0
' it seems that @entity11 is n't alone in her desire to stay looking fresh as soon as the big 4 - 0 looms , more and more surgeons are experiencing the an influx of forty - something women checking in for adjustments			1
mr @entity274 , who performed @entity11 's surgery at @entity276 said : ' i have seen a rise in patients wanting to remain younger at a younger age			1
' previously women would have come to see me in their fifties or sixties , i am now seeing more women in their forties			2
the most popular procedures for women of this age are breast uplifts , liposuction and blepharoplasty ( eyelid surgery )			1
' the most popular procedures for women in their forties are breast uplifts , liposuction and blepharoplasty ( eyelid surgery ) there are some who are allowed to grow old gracefully though - men			1
while women should get plastic surgery to hide the signs of ageing , @entity11 believes that men only need to keep in shape by eating well and heading to the gym			1
she said : ' i think men are more fortunate , they age better than women and they become more distinguished			2
' so obviously they need to keep themselves fit , but as far as surgery , they get away with lines and things like that			2
' i do n’t think there is as much emphasis on the men needing to do it			2
