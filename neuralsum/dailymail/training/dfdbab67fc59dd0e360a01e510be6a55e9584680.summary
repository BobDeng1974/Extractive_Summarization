by @entity0 , @entity1 a dramatic escalation of airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets was announced by ministers last night			1
tests on mobile phones , laptops and tablets that had been limited to passengers flying to the @entity11 will now be massively expanded to cover destinations around the world			1
@entity15 and @entity16 have both vowed to foot the bill to send on any uncharged electronic devices to passengers prevented from flying with them under the new rules			1
however , because neither airlines nor transport officials will confirm which routes are included , every single passenger must assume their gadgets will be checked , and act accordingly			0
travellers will have to prove their electronic devices – some with a notoriously short battery life – are working normally , following fears that terrorists could pack the battery compartments with explosives			1
the development , which comes at the start of the summer holiday season , is based on @entity11 intelligence amid fears of an attack by @entity53 extremists			1
security officials are concerned that a booby - trapped electronic device could be smuggled onto a plane and used as a bomb by @entity59 - based @entity58 or the @entity60 , @entity58 ’s affiliate in @entity61			2
in 2009 , @entity59 - linked explosives expert @entity62 was behind a similar plot and built an ‘ underwear bomb ’ , used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane from @entity67 bound for @entity68			0
passengers were first warned last week of extra checks on phones , and on monday @entity15 said it would ban travellers from boarding @entity11 - bound flights if their electronic devices were not charged			1
it performed a partial u-turn yesterday , announcing that anyone whose devices had a flat battery could still fly – but they would have to leave their gadgets behind , and pay for them to be sent to their home address			0
tests on mobile phones , laptops and tablets will now be expanded to cover destinations around the world official advice to travellers from the @entity92 had previously been limited to those ‘ flying to the @entity11 ’			1
it now affects those ‘ flying to and from the @entity98 ’ , and states : ‘ make sure your electronic devices are charged before you travel			1
if your device does n’t switch on , you wo n’t be allowed to bring it on to the aircraft			0
’ gadgets packed in checked luggage will continue to be scanned as normal			0
passengers whose devices are deemed to be suspicious could be prevented from leaving them in the hold – and could be barred from getting on flights altogether			2
transport secretary @entity107 said yesterday that ‘ passengers may notice additional security measures on some routes both to and from the @entity98 ’			2
a @entity92 spokesman added : ‘ in line with the @entity11 advice , passengers on some routes into and out of the @entity98 may now also be required to show that electronic devices in their hand luggage are powered up or face not being allowed to bring the device onto the aircraft			1
’ mr @entity107 told the @entity120 that the new advice ‘ is in line with that issued by the @entity11 , and we have updated our official advice to passengers accordingly ’			2
his written statement continued : ‘ for obvious reasons we will not be commenting in detail on the measures or the routes affected			0
' we will work with the aviation industry to minimise disruption as far as possible			0
’ mr @entity107 stressed there was no change to the terror threat level , which remains at ‘ substantial ’ , but warned : ‘ we face a constantly evolving threat from terrorism and must respond accordingly			0
’ the escalation in security checks came hours after @entity15 ditched its own ‘ no charge , no fly ’ rule , announcing that passengers whose devices had a flat battery could still board planes – but without their gadgets			1
the escalation in security checks came hours after @entity15 ditched its own ' no charge , no fly ' rule the airline will now see checks extended far beyond the 35 daily flights from the @entity98 to the @entity11 which were first affected			1
a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ we would advise that all customers flying on routes into and out of the @entity98 , as well on flights from the @entity98 to @entity11 cities , ensure that their electronic devices are powered up , as there may be extra searches and checks before boarding			1
' our flights continue to operate as normal			0
’ they added : ‘ safety and security is our top priority at all times and we continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world			0
’ @entity15 , @entity16 , and other @entity98 airlines , are advising passengers to arrive at airports with devices fully charged as laid down by the new rules			1
@entity15 said that passengers should arrive in good time at check in and also at the boarding gate , as there could be extra checks			1
@entity15 said : ' we have in place a range of options if customers are not able to comply , when requested , with the new regulations			0
' customers can ask to be rebooked on to a later service			0
if you wish to carry on the item as part of your hand luggage , you will need to ensure that the device can be charged ahead of your rebooked flight			0
' alternatively , customers can leave the device behind and hand it to a member of our customer service team			0
you will be asked to complete a form and the item can be collected on your return to @entity205 or forwarded to an address of your choice			0
' @entity16 said it was texting all passengers to advise them of the new arrangements and that it had charger facilities available at airports for all the most popular devices			2
the airline announced today that it is now scrapping the charge it had earlier planned to make to customers for returning their uncharged phones – putting it in line with rivals @entity15 who are also returning phones for free			2
in updated advice to passengers @entity16 said : ‘ customers can leave their uncharged device behind and @entity16 will return it to the customer without a charge			2
