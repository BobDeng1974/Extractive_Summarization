by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 19:42 est , 25 september 2013 with tomatoes at one end and potatoes at the other , it looks like the product of some @entity8 food laboratory			1
but far from being the latest genetically modified monster , this horticultural wonder is entirely natural			2
called the @entity12 , each plant can yield more than 500 sweet cherry tomatoes as well as a decent crop of white potatoes			1
on sale : @entity18 worker @entity17 with the @entity12 plant sold by his company it is produced using a hi - tech grafting process and was unveiled to the public yesterday before going on sale to gardeners in the @entity25 for the first time			1
the project took a lot longer to bear fruit than the plant does , however			2
it began 15 years ago when @entity32 , horticultural director of mail order gardening company @entity18 , was on a trip to the @entity35			0
he spotted a potato plant growing separately under a tomato plant and learned that it is possible to graft the two together because they belong to the same family			0
hybrid : the ' @entity12 ' plant produces cherry tomatoes from its stem and potatoes from its roots his problem was how to develop the idea so the plants could be sold commercially			1
the stumbling block had been how to produce tiny potato plants which have stems the same thickness as seedling tomatoes , so that the two can be joined together perfectly			1
but after a process of trial and error , and with the help of grafting specialists , @entity18 hit upon a method using a variety of potato that produces the right size shoot			0
careful variations in the temperature at which the tomato and potato are initially grown are also made to ensure the two plants are a perfect match before being joined together			1
‘ at the start , we thought it ’d just be a novelty thing to do			0
but as the trials developed we realised what we had produced was really high yield , had fantastic flavour and could be done commercially for the first time , ’ mr @entity32 said yesterday			2
an exotic red lime that will give cocktails added colour and marmalade an extra tang has gone on sale in @entity25			1
the red lime , pictured , thought to be a cross between a lemon and a mandarin , is native to @entity87			0
the trees are being sold for £ 34.99 by @entity89 of @entity90 and can be grown in a conservatory or on a patio			0
the firm says : ‘ the peel is reddish - orange			0
the pulp has a limelike aroma and is a deep orange colour			0
’ ‘ it can be planted from late april and produces trusses full of tomatoes which have a traditional tangy , sweet flavour from july to october and a good hearty crop of potatoes of a versatile variety , which can be boiled , mashed , roasted or made into chips , for late in the season			1
’ mr @entity32 added : ‘ each @entity12 plant is specially grafted by hand to create this unique double cropping feature			1
there ’s no genetic modification – it ’s an all - natural , and safe process			0
’ production begins in a specialist laboratory in @entity117 , where the delicate grafting process takes place			0
the plants are then shipped back to the @entity25 and grown on in greenhouses until they are big enough to be sold			1
the @entity12 – which has been dubbed a ‘ veg plot in a pot ’ – can be grown inside or outside , in a large patio pot or 40 - litre bag , on the allotment or in the vegetable patch , says @entity129 - based @entity18			2
