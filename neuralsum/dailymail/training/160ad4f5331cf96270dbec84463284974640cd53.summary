it was a game billed as a heavyweight battle for @entity1 ’s no 8 jersey , but the contest could now end up being settled by default if @entity4 fails to recover in time for his country ’s opening fixture against @entity25 on february 6			0
@entity4 was man of the series in the autumn tests and the onus was on his opponent to lay down a marker			0
@entity5 fly half @entity9 fires over a last - minute penalty to secure victory for the home side @entity4 is stretchered off the pitch after the @entity1 backrower suffered a leg injury in the second - half @entity16 sucked in defenders early on from a standing start in midfield			1

the home side ’s poor finishing was then punished as they leaked two more penalties to the boot of @entity51			0
the game within the game , @entity4 versus @entity88 , did not quite live up to the billing in the first half , with @entity5 scrum - half @entity66 being the stand - out performer			1
the 22 - year - old signed for @entity92 on wednesday and showed a glimpse of his skill with a sublime score after 35 minutes			2

@entity58 winger @entity80 ( right ) is tackled by @entity17 centre @entity101 @entity9 missed the conversion but his side were given another shot to take the lead after @entity107 was penalised for a deliberate knock - on			1
the wing was shown a yellow card , but once again @entity9 ’s kick fell short			0

the home side rallied and another @entity9 penalty sparked a comeback			2
