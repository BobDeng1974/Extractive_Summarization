@entity1 motorsport boss @entity0 has described @entity2 and @entity3 as ' almost like ... enemies ' in their head - to - head battle for this year 's formula one world title			1
with six races remaining , starting with sunday 's @entity9 , just 22 points separate the pair as they fight it out for the sport 's most - prized trophy			1
reflecting on what has unfolded between them on - track this season , @entity0 concedes there has been a noticeable deterioration in their roles as team - mates			1
@entity2 and @entity3 have been involved in many controversies this season most recently @entity3 allowed his @entity1 team - mate to take first place at the @entity24 @entity9 @entity0 admits @entity2 and @entity3 are ' almost like enemies ' speaking to @entity26 , @entity0 said : ' it has changed from , let 's say , an almost amicable relationship at the beginning of the season to a very intense moment , where it was almost like realising these two are enemies competing for the world title			1
' it 's also a learning process			0
these boys have been calibrated their whole life that their main priority is to win the drivers ' championship in @entity42			2
' and here they go - they are in the same car , competing against each other for that trophy , and one is going to win and one is going to fail			0
' this is a new experience for them - a difficult experience maybe			0
' tensions mounted between the pair after an incident at the @entity53 @entity9 @entity3 forced @entity2 to retire at the @entity53 @entity9 after clipping his back wheel on occasion @entity3 has shown a ruthless side to his nature , such as in @entity58 during qualifying , and again in @entity53 where he opted not to take avoiding action , instead colliding with the @entity61 and puncturing a tyre			1
@entity0 added : ' there are 22 guys out there and all of them are ruthless			2
they know what they want and they will try to take it			0
' @entity3 has always been like this			2
i do n't know why anyone had the perception of him being mr @entity73			0
' as for @entity2 , who has again endured one of those rollercoaster campaigns that have become his trademark over the seasons , @entity0 insists there is no need to change the 29 - year - old			1
@entity2 celebrates on the podium next to a disconsolate @entity3 at @entity82 ' he has found his own way and developed extremely impressively and he does n't need so much management , ' said @entity0			1
' we need to understand what kind of background and environment we need to provide so he functions best			0
' and it makes no sense to try to change a personality and say : ' you know what , you need to have the @entity96 , or the @entity3 , or the @entity98 approach , and you do n't need your dogs and you do n't need your @entity100 and you do n't need your music			2
' ' that 's not the case			0
it is his personality and it makes him function well			0
