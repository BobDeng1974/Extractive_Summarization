i was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other			0
at some point walking home i made a comment and she laughed			1
' we were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right			1
i crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was			2
i saw her lying in the road and that 's when the cars have come			2
' mr @entity8 said he did n't hear ms @entity7 fall or hear her shout for help and added : ' that 's what i ca n't get out of my head			1
she would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she did n't have heels on			0
she did n't say anything			0
' she would usually have a go at me if it was my fault			0

i did n't have time to swerve			0
if i could have done , i would have done			0

it could have been that she fell , although she would normally fall if wearing heels			0
