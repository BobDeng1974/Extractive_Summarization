sentenced : @entity0 was finally sentenced wednesday for holding a mentally disabled woman captive as a sex slave he drugged and abused for six years starting when she was sixteen years old fans of @entity4 are worried that the unorthodox sexual practices depicted in the erotic best - seller could face a backlash thanks to the upcoming trial of a man accused of abusing his wife who says they were simply engaging in @entity12			1
@entity0 faces a federal trial early next year on 11 counts of abuse against a woman authorities say he groomed to be his sex slave			1
now prosecutors plan to present consensual , though violent , acts between @entity0 and his own wife @entity21 as evidence that @entity0 has a history of sexually assaulting women			1
defense attorneys plan to show evidence of ' sadistic sexual assaults ' and s&m advocates fear that it will cause a negative public reaction to their lifestyle choices , which have come to public attention partly because of @entity33 's some worry the government 's assertion could open up people who practice bondage , dominance , sadism and masochism - or @entity41 - to criminal charges for consensual acts they 're already performing , said @entity45 , founder of the @entity47 - based @entity46			1
' we are following this case specifically because we were hoping this issue would not come up , ' she said			2
@entity0 , 45 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , is accused of grooming a young woman to be his sex slave starting in 2002 , then keeping her captive for years while making money from her images on fetish internet sites and forcing her to work as a dancer at strip clubs			1
@entity61 , 47 , is charged with five counts , including sex trafficking and forced labor trafficking			1
both have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial in february			1
' @entity61 's " consent " to the sexual assaults by defendant @entity72 does not change whether the acts legally constitute assault or not , ' prosecutors wrote in court documents filed last month			2
' pursuant to the @entity52 state assault statute ... consent is not a defense to assault resulting in serious physical injury			2
' the case came to light in early 2009 after the woman , then 23 , was hospitalized after what prosecutors said was a torture session			2
then - @entity87 attorney @entity86 called the case one of ' the most horrific ever prosecuted in this district			2
' advocates for the bdsm community say even the most brutal acts detailed in @entity0 's federal indictment are not criminal acts , as long as there was consent			0
popularity surge : @entity45 , founder of the @entity47 - based @entity46 ( left ) , said that @entity12 is on the rise since the release of @entity4 ( right ) but if the woman was too young or not intelligent enough to consent , as prosecutors allege , or if she initially gave consent and then changed her mind , most who spoke with the @entity100 said that would be criminal sexual abuse			1
it 's the inclusion of @entity0 's acts with his wife in the case that concerns bdsm advocates and @entity0 's attorney , @entity112			0
' like many people from all walks of life , my client and his wife engaged in what some might term alternative , but nonetheless , consensual sexual activity that they both enjoyed , ' @entity112 said			1
' the assertion that their consensual , marital sex life is evidence of prior criminal activity is nonsensical			1
' as in several other states , @entity52 assault laws limit instances in which consent can be used as a defense against criminal charges when serious injuries occur			0
exceptions generally are made for athletic activities and the victim 's occupation or professions in which the conduct and harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards			0

@entity153 's group contends ' serious physical injury ' is not well - defined under law			0
' the assessment of the seriousness of harm is often affected by judges ' " moral judgments about the iniquity of the conduct , " ' the organization says on its website in a section focusing on the consent issue			0
' courts tend to inflate the risk and harmfulness of an activity they want to denounce			0
for example , any injury caused during a sadomasochistic encounter has been consistently classified as serious			0
' @entity153 notes that regardless of the legal precedent , prosecutors ' attempts to present acts between @entity0 and his wife as evidence in the @entity52 case also comes at a time when kinky sex practices appear to be gaining broader public acceptance amid the popularity of the @entity186 bondage books			1
' because of @entity4 , a lot of people are trying bdsm for the first time this year , ' she said			0
' we want to be sure they understand they have to do these activities consensually , and to make sure they have the skill to do them safely			0
