it has been suggested that geysers spurting out of @entity3 ’s @entity2 may be an opportunity to spot alien life originating beneath the surface			0
this was based on observations by the @entity9 in december 2013 that saw water vapour being ejected from the moon , lending evidence to the existence of jets			1
but now scientists are somewhat baffled as they have been unable to explain why follow - up observations have failed to spot the same geysers			2
in december 2013 the @entity9 telescope spotted water vapour above @entity19			1
but follow - up observations have failed to make the same observation			1
the vapour was thought to be a sign of plumes of liquid on the surface ( illustration shown )			2
their disappearance is a mystery and several theories have been proposed according to @entity32 at @entity33 , subsequent observations by @entity9 in january and february of this year failed to spot the water vapour			1
this could be due to a lack of suitable conditions needed by @entity9 to see the plumes , namely auroral emissions			1
it could also be that the explanation for where the water vapour came from , namely plumes on the surface , was incorrect			1
@entity3 's icy moon europa is slightly smaller than @entity46 's @entity45			0
@entity19 orbits @entity3 every 3.5 days and is tidally locked - just like @entity47 - so that the same side of @entity2 faces @entity3 at all times			0
it is thought to have an iron core , a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water , like @entity46			0
unlike on @entity46 , however , this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of @entity19 , and being far from the sun , the ocean surface is globally frozen over			0
many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding @entity19 , warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by @entity3 's gravity , may have conditions favourable for life			0
however dr @entity64 of the @entity65 in @entity66 told @entity33 that he thought this was unlikely			1
‘ the best explanation still is plumes for that [ december 2013 ] dataset , no doubt about it , ’ he said			2
another suggestion is that the plumes may be too small to see ; indeed , even @entity75 has struggled to spot vapour associated with the plumes being expelled into space			0
the previous evidence for the jets had come in the form of water vapour spotted by @entity9 above @entity2			1
although several explanations were offered , @entity83 was pretty sure this vapour was due to erupting plumes on the surface			2
confirming the existence of the plumes and studying them further will be key to any future mission going to @entity19			0
however these latest findings will need to be studied further to ensure they definitely are there			0
dr @entity64 and his team will be carrying out subsequent observations with @entity9 from november this year to april 2015 to confirm that the jets exist			1
dr @entity64 tells @entity33 that it is likely just due to suitable conditions not being present at the time of the repeated observations			1
but it could also more worrying be that the initial observation was incorrect			2
this image of @entity19 was taken by @entity105 in 1979 as it flew by the @entity3 system			0
