@entity0 who can stop the awesome @entity0 ? another week , another victory for the @entity9 who now has the @entity11 in one hand and his first @entity13 in the other after catching @entity1 to win the @entity15 on sunday			1
just to put the tin lid on another glorious sunday for the @entity18 , he also reclaimed world no 1 spot for the first time since march last year			1
the 25 - year - old looks so good right now it might be some time before anyone gets a look - in again			1
the first instalment was at @entity63 two weeks ago , of course , where @entity0 held off a charging @entity1 on the final day			1
this time it was @entity0 who had to do the chasing			1
a fast start was desirable and @entity0 duly obliged with birdies on each of the first three holes			1
with @entity1 bogeying the third , a three stroke deficit had become a one stroke advantage			0
@entity1 ’s bogey had come about following a wayward drive that struck a woman on the hand with such force it knocked the diamond out of her ring			0
thankfully it was found after an increasingly frantic search			0
would @entity1 find his previously impeccable golf game ? credit the @entity39			0
he fell two behind following another @entity0 birdie at the 5th but stuck to his task to such an extent they were level once more by the turn after a rare @entity0 bogey at the 8th was followed by a @entity1 birdie at the 9th			2
keeping pace with @entity0 these days though is akin to holding off @entity94 at his best			2
once he got his nose in front again at the 11th , the closing holes took on the flavour of the inevitable			0
the pressure @entity0 was exerting told on @entity1 as he bogeyed the 15th			2
the lead was two with just three holes to play			0
@entity1 had a chance to halve the arrears at the 17th but his birdie putt from 10ft slipped by			0
@entity0 was home and dry , with the margin of victory proving the same as at @entity111 - two strokes			1
and so @entity0 had lived up to his promise on the eve of the event to keep his head down and build on the momentum of that @entity11 success rather than enjoy it			2
for him to return to the top of the world rankings , he not only had to win but @entity119 had to finish outside the top five			2
for most of the round @entity119 was fourth or better but , just to confirm this was @entity0 ’s day , he bogeyed three holes in a row from the 14th			1
@entity125 - day 3 highlights so close yet again ! @entity1 was hunted down by @entity0 and could n't cling on to the lead on his way : @entity94 had to retire from the competition after an old back injury flared up it was hard not to feel for @entity1			1
the last time he was playing as consistently well as this it was @entity94 who was invariably snatching titles from his grasp			0
now it is @entity94 ’s heir apparent			0
at least this time he is n’t consumed by feelings of jealousy or bitterness as he was back then			0
he might not like @entity94 but his respect for @entity0 was obvious as the pair chatted away happily down the 18th fairway , and there was genuine warmth in his congratulatory handshake on the final green			1
next up for @entity0 and @entity1 is the season ’s final major , the @entity149 this week , where @entity0 will try to emulate the feat of @entity151 in 1971 , when he won two majors in the space of a month , with a @entity155 victory sandwiched in between			1
few would bet against him			0
in the battle to impress the @entity159 captains as the deadline for automatic qualifying draws ever nearer , top marks went to @entity162 @entity5 and @entity4			0
showing good signs : @entity162 @entity5 was again impressive ahead of the @entity159 this year that 's a little better ! @entity165 made an eye - catching 63 as the @entity167 rediscovered some form @entity5 was a star of the last match at @entity170 and would have given @entity162 captain @entity171 something to smile about at the end of a calamitous week by finishing tied fourth			2
similarly @entity4 , who moved into the last automatic slot when @entity175 announced his withdrawal from consideration for personal reasons earlier in the week			0
@entity4 responded with a flourish , with a final round 65 to finish alongside @entity5			1
@entity181 and @entity165 showed signs of coming back to form with their eye - catching rounds of 62 and 63 respectively but there was no big week for the likes of @entity190 quartet @entity188 , @entity191 , @entity192 or @entity193 , who all finished well down the field .			2

@entity18 reclaims the world no 1 spot
the 25 - year - old followed his @entity111 victory up *superbly*
@entity0 hit a final round 66 to clinch the win at @entity46
