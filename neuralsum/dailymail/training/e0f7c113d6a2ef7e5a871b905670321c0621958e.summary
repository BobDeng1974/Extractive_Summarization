@entity3 has been struggling at the @entity4 because he is exhausted , the @entity2 superstar 's father has admitted ahead of sunday 's final against @entity6			1
@entity3 failed to make any impact in both the quarter - final against @entity9 and the semi-final against @entity11 , but @entity2 have managed to scrape through on both occasions			1
against the mighty @entity13 , however , @entity3 will be expected to deliver a matchwinning performance if his side are to lift the trophy in the @entity17			2
but statistics show that @entity3 has covered less distance on the pitch than any outfield player who has played six games at this @entity4 , apart from @entity24 's much - maligned striker @entity23			1
he was very tired , ' @entity42 told @entity44 newspaper @entity43 when asked about his son 's anonymous performance over 120 minutes against the @entity47			2
@entity3 had been one of the stars of the tournament in the group stages , where he scored four goals in the opening three games			2
the 27 - year - old forward then set up @entity56 's late extra-time winner against @entity57 with a marvellous piece of skill , but hos contribution has been next to nothing since then			2
the four - time @entity63 winner has covered 51.9km during @entity2 's run to the @entity4 final , while @entity23 , who has been criticised for his lack of movement , has moved 47.2km			1
the next lowest is @entity11 's defensive midfielder @entity68 on 53.9km			0
but a host of players have covered more ground despite playing less games less than @entity3 , including @entity73 of @entity74 and @entity75 of @entity76 , who have both played two whole games less			1
@entity79 ( 69.6km ) , @entity80 ( 69.1km ) and @entity81 ( 68.8km ) are the three players to have covered the most ground so far			0
flop : @entity23 is the only player to have played six games at the @entity4 who has run less than @entity3 most distance covered in @entity4 ( of players who have featured in six games ) : @entity79 - 69.6km @entity80 - 69.1km @entity81 - 68.8km least distance covered in @entity4 ( of players who have featured in six games ) : @entity68 - 53.9km @entity3 - 51.9km @entity23 - 47.2km @entity89 's @entity88 has suggested that @entity3 's lack of running could be in order to protect his suspect hamstring , which caused him to miss a lot of the season with @entity96			1
but @entity88 also believes @entity3 is changing hisa game and becoming more of an old - fashioned playmaker			0
' he does n’t seem to be running as much , he is waiting for the ball , ' wrote @entity88 after the last - 16 victory over @entity57			0
' his running stats were the lowest on the pitch against @entity57 , which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for @entity2			0
' the more i study his performances , the more i believe he ’s in control and waiting for that moment to arrive when he can make a difference			0
' @entity114 at his best - highlights			0

@entity3 has made no impact in @entity2 's last two matches , despite their *progress* to the @entity4 final
@entity96 forward is ' very tired ' , according to his father , @entity124
@entity2 face @entity6 in final on sunday at the @entity17
@entity3 has covered less ground than any other player to have played six matches in @entity24 *...* apart from @entity23
