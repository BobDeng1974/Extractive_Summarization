' we have to bounce back , there is no other way			1
@entity1 's players look dejected during the 5 - 0 loss to @entity4 - their heaviest at home in 24 years former @entity24 forward @entity23 fires in @entity4 's second goal of the afternoon ' we did not give ourselves a chance			1
games like that are a motivation for the next one and we have to use it			0
' we all know we were very poor and that should give us motivation to prepare ourselves for the next one			2
' @entity0 was beaten inside the first minute by @entity34 's 20 - yard shot and things got quickly worse for @entity1 as @entity4 were 4 - 0 ahead by half - time , with the @entity38 midfielder and @entity39 striker @entity23 both scoring twice before substitute @entity40 added a late fifth			1

@entity1 's @entity8 goalkeeper @entity0 insists they will ' bounce back ' from the harrowing defeat @entity48 - winner @entity40 scored the fifth and final goal of the afternoon with just 10 minutes remaining ' after that first goal it felt like we lost the focus on the game plan and let @entity4 dominate and take advantage of the mistakes we made			1
' obviously it is difficult when every five minutes you see players coming at you at full speed and sometimes you think ' what is happening ? ' ' that has not been happening this season , even in the game we played away at @entity4			2
' we have been solid but right from the first minute here it was weird and strange			0
' but hopefully we can come to some smart conclusions because we owe it to the fans as they were fantastic , even though we were struggling			0
' @entity1 were severely weakened by the absence of key midfielders @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 - a point that @entity4 manager @entity76 was quick to highlight after the game - on the back of top scorer @entity80 's midweek departure to @entity81			1
@entity4 midfielder @entity34 fires in the opening goal of the game at the @entity12 on saturday afternoon however , there was no denying @entity4 's brilliance on a day when every player was at the top of his game and @entity0 believes they are the best team in @entity91 right now			1
' if i am completely honest , comparing them to @entity81 who are up there with them , i think they are stronger , ' @entity0 said			2
' their attacking force is something really different , they are very sharp , quick and technical			0
' they are always trying to surprise you , they make great runs and are always in good positions			0
' after the last goal when they were playing around our box , i looked back and there were three players already celebrating with @entity40 and i could not believe how quickly they had got to him in our six - yard box			0
' it was because they were all in there			0
so from a physical and technical point of view they are very , very strong			0
