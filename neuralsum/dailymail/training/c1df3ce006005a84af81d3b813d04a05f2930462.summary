by @entity0 new images taken from space show an island that formed last year after a volcanic eruption in a remote region of the @entity6 is swallowing up a neighbouring island			1
the land mass , named @entity9 , was first spotted in november 2013 , in the @entity11 chain around 600 miles south of @entity12 , as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below			1
initially , scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time			2
overwhelmed : @entity9 , was formed as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below			1
it has now merged with its smaller pre-existing neighbour @entity26 my , how you 've grown : in this @entity29 satellite image from december 8 , @entity9 can be clearly seen next to the larger @entity26 but the mass , located in the @entity6 's volatile ' @entity31 ' , has grown rapidly to merge with its smaller pre-existing neighbour @entity26 , as these satellite images from the @entity33 on @entity35 show			1
the new landmass measures about 3,000ft across and has soared to a height of 200ft above sea level , reports the @entity39			1
' the intermittent , pulsing shape of the cloud stream might be a reflection of the volcanic eruption itself , ' officials from @entity29 's @entity41 said			0
growing presence : this picture was taken on december 6 , just over two weeks after the island formed smoke billows from the new islet off the coast of @entity26 , a small , uninhabited island in the @entity11 chain off the coats of @entity12			1
at that point , it was around 600ft in diameter the formation of the new island was the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years ' @entity64 explosions are essentially bubbles of lava and gas rising from @entity69 's interior in pulses			2
' underwater , sediment appears to be stirred up in a green plume that stretches eastward from the island			2
' in september a similar new island appeared off the coast of @entity77			2
it was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft high and 295ft wide			0
the phenomenon on the coastline near the port of @entity87 caused astonishment when it emerged from the @entity89 , but experts from @entity77 's @entity91 say it is now fast eroding			0
although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions , they are rarely as powerful as the one that formed @entity9			1
the chain is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands			0
the islet is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor			0
volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could have been as high as @entity106 when it emerged			0
similar eruptions in the early 1970s and 80s created tiny islets in @entity111 's territory that have since disappeared			0
experts initially said the islet , pictured , may not last long due to erosion , but it is still growing similar eruptions in the early 1970s and 80s created tiny islets in @entity111 's territory that have since disappeared the new islet rose into the ocean near the @entity118 , also known as the @entity11 chain			0

@entity9 was formed by underwater volcano in @entity6 in november
it has grown to merge with a smaller nearby island called @entity26 - shima
the combined landmass is 3,000ft wide and 200ft above sea level
