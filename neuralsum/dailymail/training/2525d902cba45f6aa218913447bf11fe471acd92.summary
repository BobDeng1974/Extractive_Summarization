by @entity0 for more than 40 years , mystery has surrounded a tiny mummy that lay among exhibits at an @entity5 centre in @entity6			0
experts were so baffled by its unusually small size and its delicate design that some even suggested it was a fake , created in the 19th century			2
now ct scans have revealed not only is the case a genuine @entity5 artefact , it contains the rare remains of a mummified foetus thought to have been just 12 weeks into development when it died			1
a ct scan has revealed what appears to be a foetus , pictured , in the centre of a tiny @entity5 mummy			1
the majority of the interior is taken up by folded strips of material			0
within this material is a darker area , about 3 - inches ( 10cm ) long , that researchers claim is a foetus , in the foetal position with the placental sac the 20 - inch ( 52cm ) mummy is part of the @entity38 collection at @entity40 ’s @entity39 and is thought to date back to the 26th dynasty – around @entity42			1
it is made of cartonnage - layers of linen stiffened with glue - and is shown wearing a yellow and blue striped wig and wide collar			1
this , coupled with its red face , suggests it belongs to a male as was customary for mummies of that time			1
the researchers said it is carefully , though not over elaborately , painted and features inscriptions on the front and back			0
but experts who have tried to decipher these inscriptions said they are meaningless and for decades , many people believed it was a fake			2
the size of the foetus inside the case suggests the child would have been between 12 and 16 weeks into development when it died			1
the 20 - inch ( 52cm ) mummy is part of the @entity38 collection at @entity40 ’s @entity39 and is thought to date back to the @entity69 - around @entity42			1
on 28 april , @entity40 ’s @entity70 from the @entity71 analysed the artefacts using a ct scanner			2
this revealed the majority of the interior of the case is taken up by folded strips of material , thought to be linen bandages			2
within these bandages is a darker area , about 3 - inches ( 10cm ) long , that the researchers claim is a foetus , in the foetal position with the placental sac			0
experts also identified what could be the foetus ' femur			2
the length of the femur , together with the size of the dark patch , is consistent with that of a foetus 12 to 16 weeks into development , continued the researchers			1
another dark patch suggests an amulet was also placed in the case , and and there are several areas with dark circles resembling strings of beads or tassels			0
the @entity108 said it was not unusual for strings of beads to be placed loose in mummy wrappings of this date			0
the mummy , pictured left , is held at @entity40 ’s @entity39 and is thought to date back to the @entity69 - around @entity42			1
it is shown wearing a yellow and blue wig and wide collar			1
this , coupled with its red face , suggests it belongs to a male			1
the scan on the left reveals the position of the foetus within this case the researchers said the case , pictured , is carefully , although not over elaborately , painted and features inscriptions on the front and back			2
but experts who have tried to decipher these inscriptions said they are meaningless and for decades , many people believed it was a fake the mummy , officially known as @entity136 , arrived in @entity6 in 1971 , but nothing is known about how @entity138 acquired it			1
on 28 april @entity40 's @entity70 , pictured , from the @entity71 analysed the artefacts using a ct scanner the mummy is made of cartonnage - layers of linen stiffened with glue - and is shown wearing a yellow and blue striped wig and wide collar			1
this , coupled with its red face , suggests it belongs to a male as was customary for mummies of that time			1
the body is decorated with a pattern of rhombus shapes perhaps imitating the bead net typically placed over some other mummies			0
it has also been suggested this pattern is reminiscent of feathers , or even the stars of the night sky			0
the researchers said it is carefully , although not over elaborately , painted and features inscriptions on the front and back			0
but experts who have tried to decipher these inscriptions said they are meaningless and for decades , many people believed it was a fake			2
in 1998 , @entity173 hospital x-rayed the cartonnage case but the results came back inconclusive , further fuelling these claims			0
‘ in contrast to the usual practice in the west today , it seems that the foetus could often be treated with care in ancient @entity5 , ’ explained @entity177 from @entity40			2
‘ for example , two coffins holding foetuses were found in the tomb of @entity187 and in @entity189 - c.1550 - 1070bc - @entity188 , a part of the @entity192 cemetery seems to have been set aside for child burials , but also foetuses and even placentas in bloody cloths			0
‘ the placenta was believed to represent the twin of the self and so was disposed of with care too			0
’ ‘ we can imagine that the probable foetus within @entity136 represents someone ’s terrible loss ; an occasion of great grief and public mourning			0
’ the body , pictured , is decorated with a pattern of rhombus shapes perhaps imitating the bead net traditionally placed over some other mummies			0
it has also been suggested this pattern is reminiscent of feathers , or even the stars of the night sky			0
