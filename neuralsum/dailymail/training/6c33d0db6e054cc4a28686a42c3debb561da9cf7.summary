by @entity0 published : 22:41 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 22:41 est , 14 november 2013 boys are 14 per cent more likely to be born prematurely than girls , according to new figures , which show an extra 5,700 boys are born early each year in the @entity5			1
data for 2012 reveals there were 34,400 boys born under 37 weeks in the @entity5 , compared to 28,700 girls			1
boys are also more likely to suffer death and disability as a result of being born too early , according to the new analysis			2
boys are 14 per cent more likely to be born prematurely than girls , according to new figures , which show an extra 5,700 boys are born early each year in the @entity5 professor @entity18 , a neonatologist and epidemiologist at the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , led the study			1
she said : ‘ baby boys have a higher likelihood of infections , jaundice , birth complications , and congenital conditions but the biggest risk for baby boys is due to pre-term birth			2
‘ for two babies born at the same degree of prematurity , a boy will have a higher risk of death and disability compared to a girl			0
‘ even in the womb , girls mature more rapidly than boys , which provides an advantage because the lungs and other organs are more developed			1
‘ one partial explanation for more pre-term births among boys is that women pregnant with a boy are more likely to have placental problems , pre-eclampsia , and high blood pressure - all associated with pre-term births			0
’ professor @entity55 said boys had a biological predisposition to being born early			1
data for 2012 reveals there were 34,400 boys born under 37 weeks in the @entity5 , compared to 28,700 girls ‘ in the @entity5 , an extra 6,000 boys or so are born pre-term each year , ’ she said			1
the studies found higher rates of disability in boys across a range of health problems , including cerebral palsy , blindness and visual impairment			0
‘ if you are born premature , even that little difference in maturity between girls and boys can make a big difference – particularly in breathing complications for boys , ’ professor @entity55 said			2
professor @entity55 ’s research was a global study on premature birth , which she said was a major problem around the world			0
the figures showed the rate of premature birth remained largely unchanged in the @entity5 at 7.8 per cent , compared to around five per cent in @entity90 countries and 12 per cent in the @entity91 there are 1,300 deaths due to complications from premature birth each year in the @entity5 , mostly among babies born under 28 weeks			1
professor @entity55 said both younger mothers and older mothers had a higher risk of premature birth , with older mothers experiencing higher rates of high blood pressure , diabetes and medical complications			0
@entity104 also had an impact , increasing the number of multiple births , which were more likely to be premature			0
globally , the studies published in the journal @entity110 , showed that of the 15.1 million babies born too soon , one million died due to prematurity			0
of the survivors , 345,000 - 2.7 per cent - had moderate or severe disability			0
in some countries , where girls receive less nutrition and medical care , girls were more likely to die than boys , despite this biological survival advantage for girls .			2

in the @entity5 , 5,700 more boys than girls are born early each year
in 2012 , 34,400 boys were born prematurely compared to 28,700 girls
boys are more likely to die or be disabled as a result of being born early
baby girls born prematurely have an advantage as they mature *quicker* in the womb meaning their organs are more developed
