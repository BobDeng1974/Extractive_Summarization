two brothers have broken a record for growing @entity3 's heaviest vegetable - with a pumpkin weighing in at 1,884 pounds			1
@entity5 and @entity6 , 53 , previously held the record until it was beaten by a pumpkin last year that weighed 1,520 pounds			1
however , the @entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , reclaimed the record yesterday at an annual weigh - in of @entity3 's biggest pumpkin			1
the @entity6 brothers ' pumpkin ( pictured ) , weighing in at nearly a ton , needed to be lifted by a tractor and amazingly , they smashed the record with their enormous 4.5ft tall pumpkin , which has a circumference of 17ft and 4in			1
@entity23 said : ' it 's absolutely enormous			2
' moments before they smashed the record , farmer @entity27 from @entity28 thought he had set it himself with a massive 1,582 pound vegetable			2
@entity5 said : ' @entity27 is a great friend of ours - we have known him for over ten years - and it was actually him who took our @entity3 record last year			0
' when his went on the scales we though it was huge and there could n't be much in it			0
' but it 's brilliant to take another step closer to the world record			0
@entity27 is chuffed to bits for us			0
' the record for the world 's biggest pumpkin is 2,032 pounds and the brothers are confident they can top it one day			1
the twins placed it on the back of their truck and transported it to the annual competition at the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity11			1
@entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 with their record breaking pumpkin at the @entity57 , @entity58 over 1,000 people attended the event in aid of the @entity65 as 25 competitors entered their prized pumpkin assets			2
@entity5 added : ' the secret behind it is that we feed them well , if you want to grow anything you 've got to feed it right			0
' if you feed your pumpkin properly then you 're going to end up with a big one			2
' we want to get the world record at one point and that 's what we do it for			0
i think we will get there in the end			0
' the twins kept their record - breaker at a garden and plant nursery which they own in @entity10			0
they planted their pumpkin - the sole survivor of a group of seven - in april and have carefully nurtured it since			0
@entity5 said : ' we just lost two of them because of soft spots in them - the competition rules are really tough			1
' we had to throw away about 4,500 pounds of pumpkin because of it			1

@entity11 brothers break record with pumpkin weighing almost a ton
the enormous vegetable could only be moved with a tractor and harness
competition rules meant 4,500 pounds worth of pumpkin was *discarded*
they claim the secret behind *success* is feeding their pumpkins properly
