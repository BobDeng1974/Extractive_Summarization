by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail and @entity1 the @entity2 leading the global fight against doping has warned @entity6 2014 competitors to beware the danger of supplements — as testers adopt a ‘ no excuses ’ policy			1
sir @entity12 , president of the @entity13 , remains frustrated by athletes continuing to put their faith in unregulated nutritional shakes and mixes			1
a dodgy supplement is often cited when a positive test is produced , with team @entity21 cyclist @entity20 recently serving a six - month ban – despite authorities ruling that he had n’t deliberately tried to cheat – as a result of a contaminated product			2
watch out : sir @entity12 has warned athletes against taking unapproved supplements former @entity29 chairman @entity12 told @entity30 : ‘ i can understand why athletes take these things , because they will do anything to get an edge and improve their performance			1
but it is extremely dangerous			1
‘ i mean , there is a clearly an issue at the moment with supplements			2
the supplements business the world over is almost entirely unregulated			2
‘ it ’s important to get control of what people put in these things , because athletes will keep taking supplements			1
very experienced athletes take them – and , in many ways , they should n’t			2
if they must take them , they have to make sure that what they ’re taking is absolutely clear			2
‘ there was a case of a @entity59 athlete in @entity60 , someone who had been to two @entity62 , should know exactly what she was doing			0
but one of her friends said : “ oh , you should take this supplement			0
‘ i mean , it ’s that kind of occasional weakness that can cause a real problem			0
if they are determined to take supplements , they should know that they ’re clean			0
@entity75 blow : cyclist @entity20 was banned for six months despite his offence being ruled an accident ‘ the new world - wide code coming into place next year will deal rather more accurately with what you would describe as minor offences			1
but basically the principle of strict liability still applies			0
’ @entity88 will run the testing programme in @entity6 and , during the run - in to the @entity62 , they ’re delivering a mandatory education programme to all @entity93 teams			1
@entity94 , @entity88 ’s director of communications and education , told @entity30 : ‘ our two aims are never to get a positive test at a major event from a @entity101 athlete and to stop a serious doper from competing			1
that ’s our goal , although we ca n’t guarantee it			0
‘ ” no excuses ” is another phrase for us			0
we do n’t want anybody to feel they lacked the knowledge they needed			0
we ’re working really hard with federations and sports to make sure they all understand the risks			0
‘ the on - going message that we ’re giving to these athletes is predominantly around not making a mistake or getting a positive test because they did n’t understand			0
’ every athlete selected to compete at the @entity62 , as well as more than 200 coaches , must sign up to @entity88 ’s education programme , the largest the organisation has ever run , to try to ensure they do not make an innocent mistake by taking an illegal supplement or medication			1
one month to go : with the games approaching the @entity129 has been touring the country competitors have been told there are ‘ no guarantees at all ’ if they buy products online and have been advised to check every supplement with the @entity137 programme , which batch - tests products for banned substances			1
@entity88 have even run mock urine - testing sessions for athletes less familiar with the rigours of drug - testing , such as members of the lawn bowls teams , to ensure @entity101 athletes are given as much information as possible ahead of the @entity62			1
@entity149 said : ‘ we worked with some of these sports in @entity151 ( the last @entity152 , in 2010 )			2
some of them were incredibly nervous about the implications of providing a sample so we ran mock testing with them			0
we showed them exactly what happens			0
it ’s not necessarily normal but it ’s definitely necessary			0
‘ a lot of athletes going ( to @entity6 ) wo n’t have been to a major event before or have needed to fully understand all of the rules around medication and supplements , in and out of competition			1
‘ but this is non-negotiable			0
it ’s mandatory for all athletes , as well as sports personnel who all have to do an online course , and it ’s the first time it ’s happened in the @entity101			1

@entity152 start in @entity6 next month
sir @entity178 says taking supplements is ' extremely dangerous '
athletes can be banned for six months for accidental offences
@entity88 will be running tests at @entity152
@entity88 also running education programme for all @entity101 athletes
