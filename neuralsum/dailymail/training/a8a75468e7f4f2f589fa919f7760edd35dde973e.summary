@entity0 today hit back at @entity1 calls for drugs to be decriminalised – claiming it would encourage children to get hooked			1
the prime minister said he did not want to send a message to youngsters than taking drugs was okay			1
he said : ‘ frankly , it is n’t			0
’ it comes after the @entity1 jumped on a landmark @entity12 report which claimed punishing substance abuse had no impact on the number of people getting addicted			1
mps , also backed a motion today calling for the government to overhaul @entity22 ’s ‘ failing ’ drug laws			1
the prime minister said he did not want to send a message to youngsters than taking drugs was okay			1
but @entity27 ( right ) said giving drug addicts criminal records was ' helping the real criminals ' - the dealers @entity0 held a @entity32 at an @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , today - in which he rejected calls for drugs to be decriminalised but the prime minister , speaking at an @entity40 call centre in @entity41 , @entity35 , said the government ’s drugs policies were working			2
he said : ‘ what we are doing is working			0
i do n't believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today			2
‘ i 'm a parent with three children - i do n't want to send out a message that somehow taking these drugs is ok and safe because , frankly , it is n't			2
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ and frankly i think one of the biggest problems we have got right now is the problem of so - called legal highs , drugs are being sold openly which can have real dangers , for particularly young people and i want to see us have tougher powers so that we ban these legal highs , take them off the high streets and protect more of our young people			0
’ but the @entity1 said treating drug addicts as criminals was ‘ nonsensical ’ and did nothing to cut down abuse			1
mr @entity27 said giving drug addicts criminal records was ' helping the real criminals ' - the dealers			0
@entity12 minister @entity72 said a landmark new report published by the @entity12 showed tough anti drug laws did not work and need to be scrapped			1
he said taking drugs should be decriminalised like in @entity76 where even heroin and cocaine are not banned			2
it comes after a @entity12 report found that decriminalising deadly narcotics would not lead to more @entity22 taking them – and that tough anti-drugs laws do not work			1
the report was led by @entity72 ( pictured ) , a @entity1 home office minister , and looked at how other countries tackle drug use - it concluded that tough anti-drugs law do not work the 55 - page report on how other countries tackle drug use – spearheaded by mr @entity72 – was released along with another @entity12 report on how to deal with dangerous ‘ legal highs ’ being sold on the @entity93			1
speaking this morning mr @entity72 said : ‘ there is no correlation between the toughness of a country 's penalty regime and the amount of drug use in that country			1
’ he added : ‘ we ’ve had what i would call mindless rhetoric over the last forty years which has tended to say there 's only one solution and anyone who offers any alternative must by definition be " soft on drugs "			0
' mr @entity72 said the @entity113 study showed ' there 's no correlation between the toughness of a particular government 's response to drugs in terms of the penalties applicable and the level of drug use in that country '			2
he said : ‘ it also shows for example that in @entity76 , where the question of drugs is treated as a health matter rather than a criminal one , that 's been effective both at getting people off drugs and therefore reducing drug use			0
so i think we do have to look at the evidence			0
‘ locking somebody up in prison for a matter of weeks because they happen to possess a @entity140 or a @entity140 drug is a nonsensical approach			0
it does n't change their attitude			0
’ earlier this month mr @entity72 accused @entity146 of sitting on the reports since july and blamed the conservatives for blocking their release for ‘ political reasons ’			1
the report on drug use abroad involved @entity1 ministers embarking on a £ 40,000 international drug law fact - finding mission			1
deputy prime minister @entity27 today accused the @entity155 of being ' frightened ' of decriminalising drugs it has sparked a row within the @entity159 as the @entity155 reject its findings and vow ‘ never ’ to decriminalise drugs – while the @entity1 say drug addicts should ‘ be helped to recover rather than put behind bars ’			1
the report said : ‘ it is not clear that decriminalisation has an impact on levels of drug use			2
looking across different countries , there is no apparent correlation between the “ toughness ” of a country ’s approach and the prevalence of adult drug use			0
’ the findings are likely to add to calls from the @entity1 to scrap jail terms for possession of drugs for personal use – a move certain to infuriate @entity155			1
earlier this year , mr @entity27 pledged to abolish prison terms for the possession of drugs for personal use , including @entity190 substances			0
however , a @entity12 source said : ‘ the @entity1 have blown £ 40,000 of taxpayers ’ money on a magical mystery tour around the world looking at countries with soft drugs laws			1
‘ but whatever they now say they want , we will never allow decriminalisation to happen			0
’ @entity202 , of anti-drugs pressure group @entity203 , said : ‘ of course decriminalisation would lead to more drug use			2
there would be an upsurge and a corresponding upsurge in crime , people suffering mental health problems and deaths			0
’ the report has put the @entity159 on a collision path - with the @entity155 vowing to ' never ' decriminalise drugs the report is especially concerning because it comes just weeks after a definitive study into the effects of long - term cannabis smoking destroyed the argument that the drug is safe			1
instead , the research paper , by a drugs adviser to the @entity224 , concluded cannabis is highly addictive , causes mental health problems and opens the door to hard drugs use			0
the @entity12 said it was considering a blanket ban on the sale of ‘ legal highs ’ being sold on the @entity93			2
the drugs , which mimic the effect of illegal substances such as ecstasy and cocaine , are no longer the preserve of specialist ‘ head shops ’ , and are now widely for sale in takeaways , petrol stations , newsagents and even pet shops			0
recently released figures show there were 60 deaths related to legal highs last year – up from 52 in 2012 and 29 in 2011 .			0
