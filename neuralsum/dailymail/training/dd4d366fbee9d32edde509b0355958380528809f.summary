the tragic story was uncovered by @entity33 's @entity32 - they named the child , who can not be identified , as @entity36 , the @entity38 word for ' unbreakable			2
' the horrific attack on @entity36 unfolded in late 2010 , just a few days before the @entity41 festival of @entity42 , when three local children lured the trusting child out of his home with the promise of a lolly			2
brutal : one of the attackers grabbed a brick and @entity36 lost consciousness after he was struck over the head it was then a group of neighborhood men grabbed him and pulled him into an alley , binding his hands and feet			1

but their hope to maim @entity36 turned into a plan to kill him after he told the men that he recognised them and he would tell his father			1

but his mother , who had gone looking for her missing child , stumbled across his blood - soaked body			2
' i barely recognized him ; he was so stained with blood , ' shes said			0
she carried her young son 's body to the side of the main road where she was met by @entity36 's father @entity96 , who had been alerted by a neighbor			1

hero : dr @entity101 examines the young boy 's head in @entity104 after he was flown over for treatment ' as a father , there is no greater pain in the world than knowing that you could not protect your child			1
' @entity36 spent three months in a @entity113 hospital , but doctors were unable to do much to repair the severed organ			0
@entity96 reported the attack to police , but was shocked to discover it had already been covered and the police would not investigate			0
a man , who pretended to be @entity36 's uncle , had told police that his nephew was attacked by two boys in a playground spat			0
hope : during surgery in the @entity128 doctors managed to rebuild the young boy 's butchered genitalia a judge also refused to help , but by sheer coincidence human rights lawyer , @entity132 was in the courthouse and felt compelled to publicise the horrifying case			2
as the founder of @entity14 @entity137 , she contacted a local television station and the story garnered so much publicity the high court was forced to ask authorities to launch an inquiry			1
within days , the @entity144 rounded up five suspects and charged them with attempted murder			0

then ( one of the men ) said to cut off his penis , and i cut it off			1
after that , ( someone else ) cut his chest and belly			1
then ( a third person ) held his head and slit his throat , ' he said			0
philanthropy : @entity128 businessman @entity168 , from @entity169 , heard the story on @entity33 and decided to fund a trip for @entity172 and his family to travel to @entity128 for treatment at the trial , according to prosecutors , it emerged that the gang maimed at least five other children to get money for begging			0
the gang kept the children confined for months in tight spaces or even in barrels and deprived them of food and then send them out to beg , according to one of the men who confessed			0
@entity36 's father believes the attack was payback after he had a confrontation with one of the men at a tea stall			2
authorities continue to look for four others who they claim are part of the same ' beggar mafia ' gang			1
to ensure @entity36 and his family stay safe , they were placed in a battalion compound , but his father remained concerned about his son 's ability to father children			0
publicised : the practice was portrayed in the 2008 movie @entity26 , in which a child in @entity28 , @entity29 , is intentionally blinded so he could bring in more money but then @entity128 businessman @entity168 , from @entity169 , heard the story on @entity33 and decided to fund a trip for @entity36 and his family to travel to @entity128 for treatment			1

although the surgeons were initially concerned they would not be able to reconstruct @entity36 's genitalia , they found it was less - damaged than originally thought on the operating table			0
they were to move the urethra - the tube used for urination - to the tip of @entity36 's penis , so he would no longer have to urinate through a tiny hole the doctors in @entity14 had created			1
and his father 's concerns about having grandchildren was abated after @entity235 's team used skin from @entity36 's thigh for the shaft of the penis and tissue from his inner cheek lining to create the tip. the success of the operation means that @entity36 will be able to have sensation and the organ will continue to grow as @entity36 gets older			2
now @entity36 's ambition for the future is to become a doctor and help other people who have been inured			0
