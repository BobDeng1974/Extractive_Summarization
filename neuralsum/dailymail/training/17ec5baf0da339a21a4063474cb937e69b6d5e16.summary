the strong pound compared to the euro means now is the time for @entity3 to bag a bargain break as prices at popular resorts such as @entity9 's @entity8 plummet			1
costs at @entity12 resorts even compare favourably to six years ago when the sterling and euro reached parity , while sales in euros are also skyrocketing as the currency drops to a decade low			1
a basket of typical holiday items in the @entity8 is now 50 per cent cheaper than it was in january 2009 , reveals new research by @entity22			1
a collection of typical holiday items in the @entity8 is now 50 per cent cheaper than it was in january 2009 new research by @entity22 confirms now is a great time to bag a bargain at eurozone resorts but it 's not all good news for our hip pockets abroad - prices in holiday hotspots such as @entity32 have risen significantly in destinations such as @entity32 and @entity34			1
the study looked at costs across 20 popular resort destinations for items such as a three - course dinner for two plus wine , sun cream and cigarettes with the package setting travellers back £ 32.67 in the @entity8 - in january 2009 the same items were £ 65			2
coming in the next lowest in price was @entity47 in @entity48 , where the same set of what some would consider essentials were £ 32.69 , which is a 39 per cent less than the 2009 price			0
@entity54 's @entity53 ( £ 33.64 ) , @entity55 ( £ 35.30 ) and @entity56 ( £ 37 ) were also sun escapes that offer good value for tourists once there			0
prices further afield , in holiday hotspots such as @entity32 , have risen significantly compared to @entity12 next lowest in price is @entity47 in @entity48 where cost of everyday items are down 39 per cent on 2009 however it 's not all good news for the @entity3 tourist 's hip pocket as costs skyrocket in destinations outside the eurozone , where a pound is worth € 1.346 , and not so close to home			1
changing pounds into local currency in the @entity77 , the @entity75 , @entity34 and @entity32 , @entity74 can receive up to £ 39 less than more favourable exchanges			1
in the survey of everyday items , @entity34 is the dearest with the same set of goods and services costing up to £ 135.35 , 80 per cent up on 2009 , mainly due to the high price of going out for dinner			1
in the survey , @entity34 is the dearest with the same set of goods and services costing up to £ 135.35 @entity91 in @entity92 ( £ 99.76 ) is the next priciest in the survey but that is still a drop on 2009 by 34 per cent			2
' there is no doubt that @entity3 tourists can look forward to getting more travel cash for their pounds this year in @entity12 but people planning trips further afield could get caught out by falling rates for sterling in some countries , ' @entity96 of @entity22 said			2
' the best way to avoid this is to consider a holiday swap to a resort where the pound still stretches further and check to see how prices for meals and drinks compare in a range of destinations			0
' potential swaps include heading to @entity117 instead of the @entity118 , @entity119 in place of @entity92 , @entity121 rather than @entity34 or @entity122 's @entity55 instead of @entity32			2
or nearby , head to @entity9 for a 20 per cent cheaper holiday that you 'd get in non-euro @entity126			1
the @entity127 added that @entity3 drivers heading for the continent during the school half - term holiday would also benefit from plunging petrol prices in @entity12			0
diesel is as low as 80p a litre in @entity135 and 83p a litre in @entity137 and @entity54			0
petrol costs just 86p a litre in @entity135 and @entity54 , is 92p a litre in @entity137 and 96p a litre in @entity142			0
@entity127 director professor @entity143 said : ' it 's a case of happy holidays for the tens of thousands of @entity74 who will be driving on the continent this half - term			0
' the low fuel prices seen in the @entity3 are being eclipsed by those across @entity12			0
motorists might be tempted to fill up before they cross the @entity151 but thanks to the strong pound they might be better off waiting until they get off the boat in places like @entity156			0

@entity12 resorts even cheaper than when the pound plummeted in 2009
a basket of holiday items in the @entity8 50 per cent cheaper than 2009
@entity22 research said eurozone holidays are bargains
prices rise significantly though in @entity34 , @entity77 , @entity32 and the @entity75
