she has such natural beauty , she could pass for a movie star			2
she smiles , her demeanour relaxed			2
in normal times , this young woman would surely have enjoyed a bright and happy future , perhaps with a husband , children , grandchildren			2
but soon after this photograph was taken , she would face almost certain death			2
the haunting image is one of a series depicting @entity15 in @entity17 - occupied @entity16 before they were rounded up to be sent to the gas chambers			1
despite the awfulness of her predicament , this @entity15 woman manages to smile brightly for the camera as she poses for @entity23 an elderly man with a yellow @entity25 fixed to his chest , speaks with @entity28 officers as he and other @entity15 are rounded up in @entity29 , @entity28 - occupied @entity16 in 1939 innocent victims : these young @entity15 girls could n't possibly have imagined the horrors that lay ahead as they pose outside their tent in another haunting photograph taken by the ardent @entity17 @entity23 the clue is the curled - up piece of yellow cloth the unknown woman wears on her lapel – a makeshift @entity25			1
all around her , and in other photos taken in the ghetto into which the @entity45 corralled their prisoners , every man , woman and child was forced to wear one			2
in peacetime , the six - pointed star was a proud symbol of @entity50			2
in the holocaust which @entity53 was about to unleash – here in the devastated town of @entity29 – it would become their death - star			1
the remarkable colour images were taken by the @entity60 ’s personal photographer , a loyal follower given unprecedented access to the @entity17 ’s elite			1
@entity23 was allowed to travel with @entity53 to record his appearances at rallies , intimate parties and in private moments			1
more usually he dedicated himself to lionising his leader and what the @entity45 regarded as their most triumphant moments			0
here , it appears , he seems simply to have been fascinated by faces from a different faith in a country under siege			0
he is said not to have shared @entity53 ’s unqualified hatred of @entity15			1
hence , whether he intended it or not , @entity23 ’s camera captured an atmosphere rarely seen before horror and carnage overtook it			1
ghetto boys : in their tattered rags the two boys smile for the camera , but the man in the centre , most probably their father , has a look of distrust etched across his face while most @entity23 's photographs focus on the glory and triumphalism of the @entity93 , here he has chosen instead to capture the misery of the conquered people instead with their clean clothes and hair neatly coiffured , these three young women do not , at first glance , appear anything like @entity23 's other subjects			1
but look closer and you find a star of @entity104 on the coat of the girl on the left after so many years , it is impossible to know for certain why so many people in the photographs are smiling			1
none appears to have been forced to pose , none seems to display any fear			0
the trilby - hatted man in the coat with a fur collar , for example , seems quite comfortable in the company of @entity28 officers			0
children in the squalor of a tented village appear unperturbed by the photographer			0
yet @entity29 , 75 miles west of @entity124 , had been bombarded and turned into a ghetto soon after @entity53 ’s invasion in september 1939			1
its sugar factory would be surrounded by barbed wire and used to imprison 8,000 jews , crammed into appalling conditions			0
some would die of infection or starvation			0
others would not live through the bitter cold of the winter			0
the ghetto existed until 1942 , when most of its surviving inhabitants were sent to death camps			0
an elderly @entity15 woman bends over her stove while a man , his @entity25 badge clearly visible , watches over her in the @entity146 makeshift dwelling : @entity15 inhabitants of the @entity149 stand near a car which has been converted into a makeshift house in early 1940 a young woman clutches a jug as she escorts an elderly @entity15 man through the @entity155 in early 1940 it is highly unlikely any of the people in these images survived			1
incredibly , the photographs did			2
the @entity29 ghetto was ‘ liquidated ’ as part of the @entity162 in the spring of 1942			1
in 1945 , as the @entity163 advanced into @entity28 , @entity23 knew he would be arrested and tried as a war criminal if he was caught with so many intimate photos of the defeated @entity60			1
so after secreting them , initially in a leather suitcase , he buried them in airtight glass jars outside @entity170 , returning from time to time to check they were safe			0
two decades after the war ended , he sold them to @entity174			0
now the pictures have gone online at @entity174			0
despite attempts to identify some of the subjects , no record was ever found of the smiling young woman			0
historians said it would be astonishing if she had survived			0
at least the camera immortalised her			0
the photos have been released to mark the official establishment of the @entity187 in october 1940 and the entire set are on display at @entity174 here			1
@entity192 life : an aerial view of the @entity146 which was set up on the grounds of a sugar factory a @entity15 woman uses a washing board to clean clothes in the @entity29 fate : in 1942 , as part of @entity53 's ' final solution ' the @entity45 began @entity202 , the plan to eliminate all of @entity16 's @entity15			1
in the spring of 1942 the @entity155 itself was ' liquidated '			0

@entity23 's photographs normally *celebrate* the glory and triumphalism of the @entity17
but in this set he depicts the tragic circumstances of @entity15 while allowing them to retain their humanity and *dignity*
taken in the @entity16 town of @entity29 in 1939 and 1940 they have been released to mark the official establishment of the @entity187
