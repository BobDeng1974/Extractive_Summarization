by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 14 february 2014 @entity2 : 18:09 est , 14 february 2014 it sounds like the plot of a science fiction film , but @entity7 researchers have revealed an audacious plan to blow up asteroid approaching @entity10 with nuclear weapons			0
the @entity13 team outlined their vision at a @entity16 conference , and say they would need just a weeks notice to launch if the system were developed			1
it sends a small projectile to create a crater on the asteroid surface , then milliseconds later a nuclear warhead which detonates inside it			1
how it would work : the @entity26 system sends a small projectile to create a crater on the asteroid surface , then milliseconds later a nuclear warhead which detonates inside it			1
called the @entity33 , or @entity26 , the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep @entity35 consists of a fore body ( a leader spacecraft ) , which would hit the comet and create blast crater			1
around a millisecond later , an aft body ( a follower spacecraft ) carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times			1
' we have the solution , using our baseline concept , to be able to mitigate the asteroid - impact threat , with any range of warning , ' @entity52 , of @entity53 at the 2014 @entity54 ( @entity54 ) meeting at @entity56 , according to @entity57			1
he said the previously undetected 65 - foot - wide ( 20 meters ) space rock that detonated in the skies above the @entity61 city of @entity62 , injuring 1,500 people a year ago has helped the cause to create asteroid busting technologies			2
' a couple of years ago , i had to use the dinosaur example to justify our research , ' he said , referring to the asteroid impact that wiped out the giant reptiles 65 million years ago			2
' now , that 's no more â€” we had this major event			0
' @entity16 has previously backed the project			2
' despite the uncertainties inherent to the nuclear disruption approach , disruption can become an effective strategy if most fragments disperse at speeds in excess of the escape velocity of an asteroid so that a very small number of fragments impacts the @entity10 , ' @entity16 said			1
@entity87 in @entity88 , where a nuclear bomb was detonated on an asteroid to save @entity10			0
now researchers believe the scheme might actually work experts say the project could be ready within a week - and would launch 24 hours before detonation occured ' it offers a potential breakthrough or great leap in mission capabilities for mitigating the impact threat of near - @entity10 objects			2
' called the @entity33 , or @entity26 , the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space			0
' the proposed @entity26 system consists of a fore body ( a leader spacecraft ) to provide proper kinetic - energy impact crater conditions for an aft body ( a follower spacecraft ) carrying nuclear explosives , ' explained @entity16			1
researchers say the previously undetected 65 - foot - wide ( 20 meters ) space rock that detonated in the skies above the @entity61 city of @entity62 , injuring 1,500 people a year ago has helped the cause to create asteroid busting technologies			0
detonating the bomb inside a crater increases its effectiveness by 20 times , the team believes			0
the nuclear bomb would follow one millisecond behind , hopefully shattered the asteroid			0
each mission would cost around $ 500m , it is believed .			0

experts say system could blast an asteroid with just a weeks notice
system would make a ' dual hit '
first impact would create a crater , which the warhead would detonate inside
