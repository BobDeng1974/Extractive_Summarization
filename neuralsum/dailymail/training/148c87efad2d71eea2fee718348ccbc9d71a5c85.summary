the drug , known as @entity8 , has a positive response in about 50 per cent of patients taking it to treat advanced melanoma - compared with between 10 and 20 per cent for the current most effective treatment , @entity14			1
the move comes partly due to a campaign spearheaded by @entity17 , the former lord mayor of @entity19 and chairman of the @entity3 @entity21			1
cancer free : @entity17 has been campaigning for the cancer treatment drug @entity8 to be released to metastatic melanoma sufferers the @entity25 approved a limited release of the drug last week , following pleas from patients , cancer doctors , support groups , @entity6 , and @entity17			1
each month , a small number of patients with metastatic melanoma , that has spread and is unable to be removed through surgery , will be given access to the drug			0
@entity8 has been lauded as a wonder drug by doctors , shrinking tumours in over half the trial patients receiving high enough doses			1

deal struck : under a deal struck between drug manufacturer @entity53 and @entity54 and the @entity25 , a limited number of advanced melanoma sufferers will be granted access to pd - 1 treatment @entity8 ' believe me , it does work , ' mr @entity17 told @entity61 's @entity60 in 2013			1

he died on november 22 , 2013			0
' the notable cases such as @entity84 , such as @entity17 , to be seen publically , to disclose the challenges they 're going through , i think really helps the public debate about moving these treatments and getting them accessible to their patients as soon as possible , ' professor @entity67 said			0
