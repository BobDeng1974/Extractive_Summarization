a @entity1 man has found an innovative way to make his @entity4 ad stand out by shooting a commercial for the car he is trying to sell			1
@entity8 , 33 , said he decided to make the video for the 2002 @entity10 , which he is selling for $ 3,000 , because he thought it would help spike people 's interest			1
' while the 2002 @entity10 is a fine car , it 's not exactly exciting with just a couple of photos on @entity4 on its own , ' he told the @entity18			0
' i thought i would add a little flair to it , plus i was bored on a sunday			0
' @entity22 , 33 , made a @entity4 ad for his 2002 @entity10 stand out by filming a commercial for the car he is selling for $ 3,000 @entity8 used a drone to film this cinematic overhead shot at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity1 the video begins from far overhead , showcasing the silver car as just a speck among the vast expanse of trees at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity1			1
@entity8 used his drone , a @entity39 1 model , to capture the cinematic effect before dramatically zooming in on the car 's tires , headlights , dashboard and seats like a classic car commercial			2
perhaps the best effect of the ad is that it is soundtracked with an old - fashioned 1987 @entity10 commercial			1
in the video , @entity8 sometimes interjects the audio with a dubbed voice over to make the information relevant to his 2002 - model car			1
' this is @entity10 the sensation ( used ) car that 's getting all the rave reviews , ' the booming announcer 's voice begins as @entity8 interrupts			2
' for its design innovations , its high technology , the way it handles and rides , ' it continues			0
' if you have n't driven @entity10 , see your ( @entity4 ad ) right away , ' the commercial ends , replacing ' @entity10 dealer ' to advertise @entity8 's post , before the final line : ' he 's got one now , with your name on it '			1
@entity8 said he picked the 1987 ad because it made his girlfriend @entity72 ( pictured together ) laugh the hardest the ad is soundtracked with an old - fashioned 1987 @entity10 commercial , which @entity8 sometimes interjects with a dubbed voice over to make the information relevant to the 2002 car @entity8 , who shot the ad over the weekend and posted it on monday , said he first got the idea to make a commercial for his car after seeing another person do a well - done ad for their @entity84			1
but he said he did n't want to ' completely rip off that guy 's idea ' , so he decided to put his own spin on the concept by searching for @entity10 commercials on @entity91			0
@entity8 said he picked the 1987 ad because it made his girlfriend @entity72 laugh the hardest			2
@entity72 gave @entity8 the @entity10 , one of his two vehicles , in exchange for a 2008 @entity95 so that he could sell the car and use the money to buy an ' adventure van '			0
@entity8 , who works as the manager of video communications at the @entity101 , is hoping to use the van to go on trips and pursue one of his major passions , taking time lapse videos of the night sky			0
