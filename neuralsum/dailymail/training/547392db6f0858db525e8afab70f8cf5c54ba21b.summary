but the latest revelations about the sexual goings - on at the top of their political establishment have shattered the usual @entity15 sangfroid			0
it emerged yesterday that the @entity17 , @entity18 , had been at the centre of an astonishing ‘ menage a six ’			2
love triangle : @entity15 first lady @entity18 ( centre ) was the shared mistress of future @entity23 president @entity22 ( left ) and right wing politician @entity24 ( right ) a less - scandalous trio : mr @entity22 , centre , pictured with rock star @entity27 , left , and @entity29 boss @entity28 today at the @entity30			1

@entity51 : @entity22 celebrates his election win with @entity18 earlier this year			2
she has since become one of the most unpopular first ladies in recent history incredibly , mr @entity24 and mr @entity22 both knew they were sleeping with the same mistress , and developed ‘ a great respect for each other ’			1
details of the complicated affairs are contained in @entity62 ( the @entity63 ) , an unauthorised biography of @entity65 by the @entity15 political writers @entity67 and @entity68 , which comes out today			1
they were also publicised across @entity15 yesterday , with respected newspapers including @entity71 and broadcasters carrying the story			0
in an interview with @entity15 magazine @entity75 , mr @entity67 said mr @entity24 and @entity65 enjoyed ‘ an intimate relationship which lasted a number of years			2

miss @entity18 was at the time married to her second husband , her fellow @entity94 magazine journalist @entity93 , with whom she has three sons			2
the @entity18 divorce was not applied for until 2007 , before being sealed in 2010 , meaning @entity65 would effectively have been seeing at least three men at one stage			0

@entity15 's former president @entity104 divorced for the second time and then married @entity106 , the former supermodel turned pop singer who had admitted that ' monogamy bores me ' miss @entity18 , who was a political affairs reporter while sleeping with the two men , would have accordingly been party to some intriguing pillow talk from across the political spectrum			1
mr @entity22 did not ‘ officially ’ break up with miss @entity38 until after she unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2007			1
the pair regularly paraded themselves as a couple up until this year , but it is now clear that mr @entity22 had taken @entity65 as a mistress many years before			1

miss @entity38 went on to lose the election and since then neither she , nor her four children with mr @entity22 , have spoken to @entity65 , accusing her of a ‘ stab in the back ’			2
the mutual loathing between @entity132 and miss @entity18 is regularly highlighted in the @entity15 media , especially because mr @entity22 ’s live - in lover has her own office at the grand presidential @entity30 , while @entity132 does not even have a parliamentary seat			1
a lawyer for @entity65 last night said she was planning to sue the authors of the book for breaking @entity15 ’s strict privacy laws , and for defamation			0
