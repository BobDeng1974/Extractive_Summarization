by @entity0 wounded tiger : a history of cricket in pakistan by @entity5 one of the many strange things about @entity9 cricket is that the aggression , the competitiveness and the bloody - mindedness the team displays on the pitch are nothing compared with what goes on in the dressing room			1
reading @entity5 ’s splendidly eccentric , if at times understandably exasperated , history of @entity21 cricket , i lost track of the number of times a player threw a tremendous strop and stomped off into the sunset			1
matters were not helped when @entity29 , booked to go out to bat at the fall of the first wicket , locked himself in the bathroom and refused to come out , @entity5 notes wearily of the first test against @entity35 in 1967			1
only a few pages later , @entity29 is at it again , this time going awol on a shopping trip with his wife			2
@entity41 , who played 88 test matched for @entity21 between 1971 and 1992 and captained the team on one occasion , in 1976 , the @entity21 squad was riven by such dissent that two separate teams turned up to contest the second test against @entity49 , one captained by @entity50 and the other by @entity52			1
‘ who ’s coming to toss with me , ’ asked the puzzled @entity49 captain , @entity53 , ‘ @entity54 or @entity55 ? ’ as @entity5 points out , deep fissures have run through @entity9 cricket ever since @entity21 became a country in 1947			1
to begin with , the shadow of colonialism was never far away			2
much to the annoyance of local players , the cricket ground in @entity64 was dominated by an enormous statue of @entity69 @entity68			2
when the first @entity21 team to tour @entity35 arrived in 1954 , they were treated either with lofty disdain , or baffled incomprehension by their hosts			0
after each day ’s play , the team would go back to their b&b to wash their kit , while their captain tried to teach them how to hold a knife and fork			0
however , there was a taste of things to come when , having been comprehensively whacked in the first three tests , @entity21 won the fourth test at the @entity85 by 24 runs			0
@entity9 test cricketer @entity87 , pictured in 1954 , became the country ’s first cricketing superstar at the tender age of 15 among the delighted spectators was one general @entity92 , who was later to mount a military coup — thereby setting in train the pattern that has bedeviled @entity21 , and @entity9 cricket , ever since			1
cricket in @entity21 was organised very differently to other countries			0
cricketers played for teams sponsored by the armed forces , police , or government departments , with the players in effect being paid to do non-existent jobs			1
when he was just 15 , @entity87 , who became the country ’s first cricketing superstar , was appointed to the post of roads inspector by the @entity111			0
his younger brother @entity112 , who soon joined him in the @entity21 team , was only 12 when he became a cement clerk in the same department			0
in 1958 , @entity87 scored one of the greatest of all test innings — 337 against the @entity117 in @entity118			0
it took him 16 hours and 39 minutes , at the time the longest innings ever played in first - class cricket			1
@entity5 suggests controversial cricketer @entity122 was n't guilty of match - fixing there were no thigh pads in those days , and so @entity87 pushed bathroom towels down his trousers to try to protect himself against the @entity129 fast bowlers			1
not that it did much good — afterwards , he had a deep indentation in one of his legs , while his cheekbones were black with burned blood from spending so long in the sun. although this is a sober — and comprehensive — history on the one hand , it ’s far less dry than this description might imply			0
it ’s also a kind of love - letter to @entity21 cricket , a salute to its fortitude and fieryness			2
@entity5 makes no attempt to disguise his admiration for some of the country ’s most notable , and controversial , figures			2
thus , the former @entity21 captain @entity152 , usually depicted as a colossal egomaniac , emerges in quite different colours here — as clever , courageous , and always willing to put his team ’s interests above his own			0
@entity5 even has some sympathetic words for the fast bowler @entity122 , who was found guilty of match - fixing in 2010 and imprisoned			1
he insists , very persuasively , that @entity122 was an innocent caught up in events that were way out of his control			2
what becomes plain is that , in a country beset by tribal and political schisms , cricket is one of the few things that unites people			0
remarkably , the @entity169 turn out to be keen cricketers , although their insistence on wearing traditional costume apparently plays havoc with their stroke play			1
even so , there are limits			0
@entity177 have never taken to cricket , @entity5 records			1
it seems they ’ve always preferred the considerably less macho charms of volleyball .			0

@entity5 *re-visits* the match - fixing case involving @entity122
@entity9 cricketers historically played for teams sponsored by the armed forces , police , or government departments
the @entity169 turn out to be keen cricketers , although @entity177 are less keen
