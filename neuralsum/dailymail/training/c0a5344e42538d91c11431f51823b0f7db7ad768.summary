there is something about @entity3 ’s atmosphere on @entity5 nights that could prove really significant when the @entity6 starts again this week			1
@entity7 are back for the first time since they were knocked out in the group stages in 2009			1
many would say they are back where they belong because of the incredible history of those @entity6 - winning sides of the @entity16 and @entity17 — and that truly extraordinary night in @entity18 in 2005			1
it is a tournament that is in the dna of the club and some @entity5 teams will leave @entity7 this season having had the shock of their lives , playing in front of that crowd in a @entity6 night game			1
@entity28 ( right ) is preparing @entity7 for their @entity6 return after five years away on those evenings , there are few stadiums that can compare			1
and although @entity7 are back for the first time in five years , the other @entity35 clubs — @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 — can not come close to @entity7 in terms of tradition in this tournament			1
of the current players , only @entity42 has helped to create that history but sometimes that does not matter because many fans watching will have seen @entity7 in the @entity16 and @entity17 and would have been in @entity18			2
there is something about the energy that a crowd can give you that can make the difference on these occasions			0
@entity42 celebrates on a dramatic night at @entity3 where @entity7 beat @entity54 to advance @entity42 fires home arguably his most famous goal ever to see @entity7 past @entity54 saturday evening was a good example of the difference @entity59 makes — the atmosphere was flat in the 1 - 0 defeat to @entity62			1
i ’m sure it will be different on tuesday night			2
@entity7 have given their squad depth and can be scintillating in attack			2
they are also well disciplined and drilled tactically			0
put all that together with an emotional @entity3 crowd and many teams will come away wondering what has happened to them			2
@entity7 can get out of their group against @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75			1
on their day , they could even give @entity73 a shock and i have them down to make the quarter - or semi-finals			2
in contrast , @entity36 have the squad size and the quality to win the @entity6 , but at times they have played like novices in the tournament			1
it does not make any sense , because they have players who have now played in @entity88 or @entity6 finals and who have plenty of experience on the @entity5 stage			1
@entity7 fans at the famous @entity96 end come alive on @entity6 nights at @entity3 @entity7 parade the @entity6 on an open - top bus outside @entity3 after winning it in 2005 @entity101 punches the air after scoring against @entity103 at @entity3 in 2005 but , somehow , that does n’t translate on the pitch			1
maybe as a club they need to build up some belief that will transmit itself to the players			0
it is almost as if those players , with all their experience , still have a psychological hurdle to overcome because the club are so new to the tournament			2
that said , tactics have also played a part in @entity36 ’s struggles , especially last year when @entity120 played two strikers against the best teams			1
they ended up getting battered against @entity124 at home last season and it will be fascinating to see whether he does the same when they take on @entity124 at the @entity130 on wednesday			0
@entity6 games need a different plan from @entity134 matches			2
former @entity136 boss sir @entity135 realised that			0
at the start of his career he was faithful to his 4 - 4 - 2 formation , but to win the @entity6 he modified it to ensure he had an extra man in midfield			1
@entity7 suffered a domestic setback on saturday when @entity145 sealed victory for @entity62 with their spending , it is clear that @entity36 ’s owners expect to win the @entity6 — and soon — but i do n’t believe this will be their year			1
@entity38 will have their moments and impress going forward			2
but i still feel they will be found out defensively			0
i was surprised they did n’t sign another holding midfielder or a centre - half			2
@entity37 are probably the best - placed @entity35 team to win it			1
what i like about their squad is the balance			0
that back four does n’t look like it ’s going to let in goals , their midfield is considerably stronger than last season with @entity166 and @entity167 , and they have added @entity168 up front			2
what i feel will cost them is a sustained challenge for the @entity134			0
it is harder for @entity35 clubs to compete in @entity59 because there are more domestic games against strong rivals compared to @entity177 and @entity178			0
and matches against lower - placed sides have more intensity , too			2
@entity37 have a superb core of 14 players , but they will struggle in @entity59 if they pick up injuries			1
@entity36 are yet to seriously challenge for the @entity6 during their short @entity5 history @entity124 will be first up for @entity36 at the @entity130 when they kick off their 2014 campaign that ’s why i think the most likely winner will come from @entity73 , @entity191 and @entity124			1
@entity191 have added @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 but new coach @entity196 will be keen to ensure they are blooding youngsters from the academy			0
so much will depend on @entity199			0
he did n’t look himself at the @entity88 but if he can return to his best , then they can beat any team			0
holders @entity73 have great options in attack , especially having signed @entity204 , but i wonder about the balance			0
@entity38 scraped past @entity206 in the play - off round to make it into the group stages of the @entity6 @entity168 scored a hat - trick against @entity211 to continue his blistering start at @entity37 the fact that @entity214 is injured and they sold @entity216 to @entity124 reminds me of when president @entity217 sold @entity218 to @entity37 in 2003			1
up to that point , @entity73 were winning league titles and won the @entity6			1
after @entity218 left they did n’t win the @entity6 until this year and went four years before they won the league again			1
that is what happens when presidents sign players			0
as for @entity124 , signing @entity216 might be really significant , especially as @entity226 and @entity227 are injured			0
he brings balance to any team			0
they are full of @entity88 winners in @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 and up front they have added @entity238			0
perhaps that makes @entity124 marginal favourites			0
it would be nice if it were an @entity35 team , but i just do n’t see it			0
@entity191 have added @entity192 ( centre ) to a squad already filled with superstars defending champions @entity73 have been drawn in the same group as @entity7 this season talk is cheap and if we really want @entity35 sides to do well in the @entity6 we should ensure they receive the best help			1
@entity253 has often brought up the fact that the @entity134 scheduling does our teams no favours , whereas @entity177 sides often play on a friday night to allow more preparation time			0
the @entity134 should do the same , or at least start at 12.45pm on saturdays			0
our teams are playing in a more competitive league than their rivals and we need to make sure they are not at a disadvantage .			0

@entity6 returns this week as group stage begins
@entity7 back in the tournament after a five - year *absence*
the @entity3 atmosphere on a big @entity5 night will *inspire* them
@entity7 have won the @entity6 five times , the last in 2005
@entity36 yet to fulfil potential on @entity6 stage
@entity38 are flaky , and @entity37 could have *problems* with a couple injuries
