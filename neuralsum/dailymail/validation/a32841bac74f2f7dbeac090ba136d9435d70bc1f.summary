the @entity1 ' @entity0 and @entity2 were among the crowds that flocked outside to watch the partial solar eclipse this morning			1
resplendent in a crimson ensemble , 43 - year - old @entity2 donned protective glasses and watched from a wharf in @entity9 alongside her husband			2
perhaps not finding the eclipse quite as dramatic as she had hoped , the @entity12 - born royal soon began laughing and whipped off her glasses			0
in @entity29 , millions turned out to watch the first solar eclipse of this century , which plunged parts of the @entity29 in to brief darkness			2
@entity29 's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the @entity34 started to move between us and the sun , with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country			0
today 's eclipse produced a 100 - mile - wide ' totality ' shadow path that crossed the @entity41 , resulting in a partial eclipse across the northern hemisphere , including the whole of @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , northern @entity48 and western @entity49			0
is that it ? a less enamoured @entity2 took off her glasses early and turned away on tour : the @entity1 royals are touring @entity9 today as part of a brief 48 - hour tour of northern @entity25 meeting : they are attending a meeting aimed at boosting @entity1 business and trade links gas : the royal couple are also being shown a new barge that is fitted out to carry liquefied natural gas @entity2 and @entity0 arrived @entity25 yesterday , after completing a short three - day tour of @entity67			1
having waved goodbye to their @entity67 hosts at @entity72 's @entity71 , they flew on to @entity73 where they were greeted by excited well - wishers clutching hand - painted portraits			0
after a lunchtime reception , they then continued on to the @entity79 in @entity80 , where @entity2 came dangerously close to getting her shoe stuck in some silage			0
along with watching the eclipse , today 's schedule includes a meeting at @entity9 's @entity86 to discuss business opportunities for @entity1 firms in @entity25			1
the royals will also be shown a newly - built barge , named the @entity91 , which is designed to carry liquefied natural gas			0
all natural : yesterday , @entity2 came close to treading in some silage ( fermented hay ) during a farm visit looking around : the @entity1 royals were touring the @entity79 in @entity98 warm welcome : the couple arrived in @entity73 to be met by well - wishers proffering portraits of them @entity2 and @entity0 will also tour the @entity103 , which focuses on innovation in theatre technology - also a speciality of the @entity1 performing arts sector			1
so keen are the @entity1 royals on giving local performers a boost , they flew four dancers from @entity113 to @entity72 for a performance on wednesday night			2
the men , all from the @entity116 , got their big moment during a banquet hosted by @entity2 and @entity0 for the @entity67 royals			1
designed to give @entity1 culture a platform , the minimally - clad performers treated @entity67 's @entity123 and her family to an unusual modern dance performance			2
watching from the front row was @entity2 herself , elegant in a patriotic russet dress beside the @entity131 country 's crown prince @entity129			0
interesting : the couple spent their last night in @entity67 treating their hosts to a @entity1 dance performance keep smiling : @entity2 appeared to enjoy the modern dance performance and beamed throughout looking good : the 43 - year - old @entity1 queen looked fabulous in a patriotic russet gown round of applause : all the royals politely applauded at the end of the performance			1

the @entity1 royals are currently in @entity9 and watched the eclipse there
@entity2 turned away smiling while @entity0 looked *enthralled*
@entity150 plunged most of the @entity151 into partial darkness
@entity1 royals have just finished a tour of @entity67 and return home today
