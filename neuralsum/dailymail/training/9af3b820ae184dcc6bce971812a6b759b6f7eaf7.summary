these unique pictures were taken with the world 's ' first digital fisheye camera ' after its developer managed to get the device through the meshing of a monkey pen			1
the snaps show the monkeys playing at the @entity16 - giving the viewer a rare glimpse of life from inside their pens			1
there is no viewfinder or screen to view the images so users will have to wait until they have hooked the device up to their computers , which is how the camera is charged , before they can see the end result of their pictures			2
its tiny size means it can squeeze in pretty much anywhere and take images from a unique vantage point			0
the @entity53 postgraduate , 25 , came up with the idea after trying to buy a fisheye camera lens but failing to find one in his budget			2
miniscule : the world 's ' first digital lomo - fisheye camera ' is so small it can fit in the palm of your hand inventor @entity34 is now hoping to get funding to make his design available to the general public after completing the camera , he was inundated with requests from other people who wanted to buy one			1
he is now trying to secure funding of £ 35,000 to make 500 more cameras and get the product on to the market			0
mr @entity34 told the @entity75 : ‘ i could n’t afford to spend hundreds of pounds on a lens for my slr , so i decided to design my own point and shoot fisheye camera			1
‘ this is a really unique camera , there really is n’t anything else like it currently out there			0
‘ it would be great for others to be able to take some cool photos at a fraction of the regular cost of a fisheye lens			0
’ the @entity53 postgraduate student also took this picture of a pony at a nearby stables with his fisheye camera the student came up with the camera design after failing to find a fisheye lens in his price range			2
