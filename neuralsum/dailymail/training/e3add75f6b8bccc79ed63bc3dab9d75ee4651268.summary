by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 3 july 2012 they came in the the night ... and changed the face of the capital 's road			1
this is the army of workmen putting the final touches to @entity9 's streets for the @entity10 as they paint fast - track lanes reserved for @entity12			1
dozens of men in fluorescent jackets were dispatched along 30 miles of road around east and central @entity9 to daub the iconic rings and white lines on the tarmac			1
by the early morning rush the workers - believed to have numbered at least 100 - had disappeared			1
but in their wake they left fast - track lanes that ordinary drivers will be hit with £ 130 fines if they dare to venture in to			1
members of public can not drive in them from july 27 to august 12 as @entity36 slept , workmen marked the 30 miles of tarmac which will be out of bounds to motorists between july 27 and august 12			1
although not operational until two days before the @entity10 , the @entity40 are shaping up to be one of the biggest irritants to those living in the capital			1
used to crawling along the city 's clogged narrow streets , motorists will now have the added insult of watching 80,000 athletes , officials , sponsors and media moving freely in chauffeur - driven vehicles on the specially designated lanes			1
the high - profile guests will travel glide through the busy streets using the @entity57			0
adjustments to traffic lights will begin this week			0
' i think it is unreasonable to expect @entity9 to have road closures and places closed off - people still have to get around , ' said @entity65 , 45 , a retailer from south @entity9			2
' i do n't think @entity9 is being considered			0
' the fight for space is likely to be so keen that some taxi drivers are threatening to leave their car keys at home and go away			0
' i think it 's going to be a nightmare - i wo n't be able to get around , the roads will be blocked , ' said taxi driver @entity75 , 45 , his black cab idling as he waited to pick up a customer in central @entity9			0
workmen peel off a stencil used to paint the markings and underneath the iconic rings are revealed a hard nights work : workmen peel off the last bits of white paint from the markings , and right , stand back to admire their work sprint finish : the men pack up their tools as some members of the public look on at the lanes , which they will be fined £ 130 for driving in ' people do n't like sitting in the back of a cab when it 's not moving			1
' the @entity99 - marked lanes , which run alongside lanes for general traffic , will only come into operation on wednesday july 25 - two days before the @entity31 opening ceremony , with ' ordinary ' drivers allowed to use them until then			2
the lanes have been dubbed ' @entity100 ' after the @entity108 - built @entity107 car that carried @entity110 leaders around			2
there will be 30 miles of @entity40 in @entity9 , with the lanes forming part of the 109 - mile @entity31 ( @entity31 ) which links @entity30 venues			1
yellow route : roads on this route will have a dedicated ' @entity31 - only ' lane for athletes , officials , vips , sponsors and media			2
the lanes will be in force from 6am until midnight			0
red route : roads on this route , the busiest " core section " of the vip network , will be affected by major restrictions to speed up traffic but will be fully open to the public			0
measures could include bans on parking and right - turns , suspension of pedestrian crossings , phasing of traffic lights and no public entry from side roads			2
blue route : roads on this route will only be affected on competition days			0
they will run from the athletes ' accommodation to venues such as @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			0
variable message signs along the lanes will state that drivers will be able to use them until july 25 , although @entity154 ( @entity154 ) is advising motorists to avoid central @entity9 around the @entity31 and @entity30 venues from @entity157			2
the exception to the free - to - use rule will be the @entity160 on the @entity161 near @entity162 which will start on monday july 16 as the ' @entity163 ' - athletes , officials and the world 's media - begin to arrive in big numbers			1
before that there will be a reversal of traffic flow in the @entity173 at @entity174 in @entity9 to assist traffic flows while on friday july 20 further @entity31 work will be carried out , including the installation of barriers to simplify junctions			0
when the @entity181 come into full operation on july 25 , they will be enforced from 6am to midnight daily			0
fast - track : a car zips along one of the lanes in front on the @entity9 eye			1
the roads will certainly not be this clear during the @entity30 @entity12 fast lanes : a car drives in an @entity191 on @entity192 after workmen painted on the markings last night up to one million extra visitors are expected in @entity9 on each day of the @entity30 and there will be up to 1,300 ' @entity163 ' vehicles an hour travelling between key venues			1
a penalty charge of £ 130 will be issued to owners of vehicles who break the regulations , including driving in @entity40 or stopping along the route , and any illegally parked vehicle will be removed to a vehicle pound and may incur a release fee of £ 200			1
the @entity40 will end around two days after the @entity10 finishes on august 12 and will not be in operation between the @entity10 and @entity209			1
a smaller @entity31 will come into operation shortly before the @entity209 start on august 29			0
having dedicated routes to events became an @entity31 priority after difficulties in the @entity30 led to the venue in @entity216 , @entity217 , being dubbed ' the lost city of @entity219 '			0
@entity9 mayor @entity220 said : ' following the unveiling of the @entity222 on @entity223 , the @entity224 on @entity9 's roads really bring home how @entity9 has begun its transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue			0
' the @entity31 is a requirement of all host cities and is vital in ensuring athletes , officials and the world 's media get to their events on time			2
' my team slashed its length by one third of what had been planned and we 're working hard to introduce changes to the road network as late as possible , to minimise the impact on @entity36 and businesses			0
' but with the @entity30 less than one month away , we 're into the home straight and are working flat out to ensure we are ready to welcome the world			0

£ 130 fine for driving in @entity10 lanes between july 27 and august 12

the public faces *gridlock* as athletes and officials breeze round the city
