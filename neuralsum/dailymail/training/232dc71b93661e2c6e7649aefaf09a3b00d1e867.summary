' we were told to expect the worst because the babies were born so prematurely			2
' the doctors said before i gave birth that babies are classed as not viable until 24 weeks so prepare yourselves for bad news			1

' not being able to hold your children when they are born was the worst feeling , we could n't even touch them at first because their skin was so weak			0
' mr and mrs @entity5 , who have been together for four years , were overjoyed when they were told at their 12 week scan that they were expecting twins			1
