by @entity0 charities in @entity3 are being handed a far larger slice of lottery money than @entity7 ones , it has emerged			1
projects north of the border receive nearly three times as much cash per head of population – £ 25.27 compared to the £ 9.46 awarded in @entity7			1
the money has been used to fund controversial @entity3 projects such as ‘ gay propaganda ’ dvds for schools , camcorders for asylum seekers and a ‘ groovy ’ diversity parade			1
thousands have also been spent on dressmaking lessons exclusively for @entity3 from ethnic minorities , and on ‘ educating ’ @entity3 householders about renewable energy			1
the @entity27 – the quango that allocates lottery money – dedicated £ 134million last year to projects in @entity3 and £ 501million to @entity7 ones despite @entity7 ’s population being ten times larger			1
critics said the disparity was just another example of the way those south of the border get far less money showered on them by public bodies than those to the north			0
@entity42 , @entity43 mp for @entity44 , said the ‘ outdated ’ @entity46 formula – the mechanism by which the @entity48 divides spending between the home nations – already meant that ‘ significantly more taxpayers ’ money ’ goes to @entity3			1
‘ this @entity27 money is simply adding to the distortion , ’ he said			1
‘ people will wonder how that distribution can possibly be fair , as most would have thought that all parts of the @entity59 were benefiting equally			0
’ @entity60 and @entity61 also did far better than @entity7 in terms of @entity27 spending – with the @entity60 getting £ 13.49 per head and the @entity65 £ 31.33			1
the fund said the disparity between @entity7 and @entity3 was an exception , but analysis of previous years shows @entity7 consistently receives less money per head than the other home nations			1
spending plans also show that @entity3 is due to get a larger proportion of cash than @entity7 until at least 2015			1
lucky help : the @entity27 is responsible for distributing around 40 per cent of awards raised for good causes from the @entity78 the @entity27 makes grants to projects working in health , education and the environment ; and most of its money goes to charities			1
it is responsible for distributing around 40 per cent of awards raised for good causes from the @entity78 , and says it distributes its cash based on both population size and indices of deprivation			2
the organisation ’s annual report reveals that this means that projects from the three smaller nations of the @entity59 are far more likely to benefit			2
in @entity3 , for example , £ 10million was set aside to address ‘ hardship which has sent people to food banks and community clothing centres ’ , £ 6.5million to tackle domestic abuse and £ 8million to provide safe housing to victims of such abuse			1
in 2012/13 , @entity7 received 7,600 awards totalling £ 501million , @entity3 received 3,122 awards totalling £ 134million , @entity60 got 950 totalling £ 41million and @entity61 833 totalling £ 57million			1
as well as having separate pots for the four nations , the annual report reveals that there is a £ 44.7million fund for 323 @entity59 - wide projects			2
it is not known how this is distributed			0
previous reports show that the disparity in per capita spending has persisted			0
