hundreds of terrified parents were left panicking after a school wrongly reported their children were missing after accidentally sending them a bulk truancy text using its automated service			1
on monday , the parents of children at @entity7 in @entity8 received the text message saying their kids had not arrived for the day			1
but when they frantically called the school they were told the message had been sent in error			1
despite the school 's initial claims there was an issue with its automated truancy service , it was later confirmed that the message was sent after a mistake was made by those operating the service			1
the message was accidentally sent to hundreds of parents whose children attend @entity7 ( pictured ) pictured is the letter sent from the school to parents regarding the erroneous text			1
despite initially saying there had been a error with the service , it was later discovered a user had made the mistake one grandmother said that her daughter , who has a child at the secondary school , had been ' frightened to death ' by the text			1
she said : ' she went haring to the school			1
she thought something had happened to my grandchild			0
she 's still in a state of shock now			0
' @entity48 , 42 , works at the @entity49 in @entity50			0
she has a son in year seven called @entity52			0
she said : ' my husband got the message and rang me while i was at work			2
he was going mental because obviously we both thought that @entity52 was in school			2
' i thought he had not gone to school that morning , had walked out or just missed registration			2
it is worrying though , especially when you are at work and your son has only just started at the school			2
' what 's worse is that it took me half an hour to get through and this is the second time this has happened to me			0
my husband works away and it is really hard to imagine what would have happened if @entity52 had genuinely gone missing			0
the school need to sort it out			2
' @entity73 , 38 , of @entity50 , is unemployed , and received the text to say her son @entity75 , 12 , was absent from the school			1
pictured is the text message , sent by accident , and received by parents asking why their child was absent she said : ' it was a bit of a strange experience to go through			1
i was at home and this text came through to say that @entity75 was absent			2
' that sparked off a big panic			0
i knew that @entity75 had got on the bus up the road , so i phoned my husband panicking			0
' all kinds of potential scenarios were going through my head			0
i thought the bus might have crashed or someone might have grabbed him – all kinds of things were going through my mind			0
i was trying to phone the school for about 30 minutes but i could not get through as it was engaged			2
i just thought – where on earth is he ? @entity75 is not one to play truant and i had never seen a message like that before			2
' after a while i phoned a friend , who said she had got the same message about her son and we started to think someone might have hacked the school ’s message system			1
' but none of us could not get through to the school			2
i think every parent must have been trying to get through			0
' some of the parents have been saying it was not that bad			2
but me and my friends were very worried			0
' i still can not understand how it happened			0
at first i was a bit angry – but now i am just confused by it all			0
and just thankful it turned out that nothing had happened to my son			0
' parent @entity130 , said : ' i was concerned that my daughter was n't at school , but as the school switchboard was then constantly engaged for 10 minutes , i made the assumption that lots of people were calling in , and so it was likely that the message had been sent to a lot of people			1
headteacher @entity141 ( pictured ) has since apologised to all parents who received the alarming message another mother , who asked not to be named , confirmed she had received the text alongside an apology approximately 20 minutes later			1
she said : ' i heard that they contacted every single person they had a number for by accident			0
' it must have been hundreds and hundreds of people			0
obviously there is an amusing slant but as a parent receiving that text it was really worrying			0
' even if you knew where your child was , like i did , you still question it			0
' headteacher @entity141 apologised to parents who received the text			1
she said the school uses electronic alerts if a child fails to arrive - but was ' completely unaware ' of the problem until messages started to flood in			1
' we use the ' @entity173 ' system to send a text to the parent or carer to alert them to a child being absent in the morning register , ' she said			1
' this will always take place before 11am			0
parents and carers then text back at various points during the day to explain why			1
' ms @entity141 said that on monday their attendance officer was trying to see if they had received any new messages but instead sent a ' truancy text '			1
parents got the message just after 2pm			1
ms @entity141 would not disclose what was in the message but it is thought that it contained the child 's name , said they were absent from school and asked the parents to call or respond			1
staff were only made aware of the mistake by children asking questions and parents calling the office			0
although it was initially claimed it was the fault of the automated truancy system , ms @entity141 later said it was an ' administrative ' issue .			1
