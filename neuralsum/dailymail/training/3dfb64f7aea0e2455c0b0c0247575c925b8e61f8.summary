they are the most unlikely contestants in a verbal battle over conservation – a 14 - year - old schoolgirl and arguably the world 's most powerful woman , @entity4			1
@entity6 happens to be the daughter of the late @entity8 @entity8 and the teenager is now snapping at the heels of the @entity12 secretary of state after an essay she wrote for mrs @entity4 's e-journal was savaged by the editors			1
although it is unlikely that mrs @entity4 had a hand in drastically editing @entity6 's 1,000 word essay on conservation , the @entity17 teenager is furious about the re-worked presentation and has refused to allow it to go into print			1
going head to head : the daughter of ' @entity8 ' @entity8 , @entity6 , pictured ( left ) at her father 's memorial in 2006 , has taken issue with @entity4 ( right ) after an essay the teenager submitted to the @entity11 's e-journal was savaged by its editors what she wrote , she said , was her opinion about the way a growing world population was the greatest danger to conservation ' and i do n't want that edited out			1
' but mrs @entity4 's editors were sticking to their guns – and @entity6 was last night sticking to hers			1
with her father – who died when he was stabbed in the heart by a stingray in september 2006 – once being one of the most well - known faces on @entity12 tv with his crocodile hunting series , it might have been thought that whatever @entity6 wrote would be welcomed			1
her essay was scheduled to be published in the december issue of mrs @entity4 's e-journal titled @entity53 as part of the secretary of state 's endangered species initiative			1
after @entity6 submitted her carefully - prepared work to the @entity12 , it was returned to her for her final approval – with large amounts edited out			2
defending her daughter : @entity6 's mother , @entity63 ( left ) , pictured with husband @entity8 before his death in 2006 , said her daughter was less than impressed with the treatment she had received from the @entity66 she had angled her essay on the problems the world faces with a growing population , comparing it to throwing a party and having too many guests turn up for everyone to be fed. ' how is it possible that our fragile planet can sustain these masses of people ? ' she wrote			1
@entity6 's mother , mrs @entity78 , widow of the crocodile hunter , told @entity81 's @entity80 that her daughter was less than impressed with the treatment she had received from the @entity66			1
' it 's interesting that she was asked to write an essay about the environment and included the consideration of population ( growth ) and they returned her essay edited and complete edited that out			1
' larger than life : mr @entity8 , who was known for his bravery in the face of crocodiles , died in 2006 after being pierced in the chest by a stingray barb mrs @entity6 , who is @entity12 by birth , said @entity6 wrote to @entity4 's organisation later asking ' what happened to freedom of speech ? this is my opinion and i do n't want that edited out			1
' @entity6 , who , like her father before her , has soared to popularity in the @entity12 with her own tv show based on conservation , refused to allow the edited essay to go into print			1
aware that she might have raised the eyebrows of mrs @entity4 herself with her refusal to allow her essay to be published , @entity6 is holding her ground			1
' she just wanted her whole essay to be printed rather than just a snippet of it , ' said a spokesman for the @entity118 in @entity119 , where @entity6 lives			2
mrs @entity6 said that population growth was an unpopular topic – ' i just think it 's fascinating that when @entity6 does an interview and talks about population , more than 50 per cent of the time it 's edited out			2
' @entity6 's essay has been published in full on @entity17 news website and can be read in full at : @entity131			1
she wrote : ' i believe that most problems in the world today , such as climate change , stem from one immense problem which seems to be the ' elephant in the room ' that no - one wants to talk about			2
' this problem is our ever expanding human population			2
we are experiencing @entity143 's sixth mass extinction right now			2
' keep in mind that the previous five were caused by things like asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions			0
' i once had a friend who lived to be 104 years old			0
@entity149 was a remarkable woman who experienced so much in her life time			0
' when she was born there was no such thing as sliced bread , zippers or even plastic			0
@entity149 did not see a car until she was ten years old			0
' however , to me the most astonishing fact is that when @entity149 was born there were 1.5billion people on the planet			0
' in one woman 's lifetime , the human population increased by more than 5 billion people			2
these are truly overwhelming figures			0
' i must ask this question , how is it possible that our fragile planet can sustain these masses of people ? ' think of it this way			0
pretend for a moment that i 'm having a party , inviting 15 of my closest friends			0
' i 've rented a room big enough to fit 15 people , i 've bought 15 sandwiches for each of my friends to eat , and i have put together 15 party bags , one for each friend			0
' my party is about to start , and i hear a knock at the door			0
my friends are here ! ' only , when i open the door , 70 of my friends are standing there wanting to come to the party ! what can i do ? ' the room is only big enough to fit 15 , with 70 we wo n't have any room to move and dance			0
' i do n't have enough food			0
do i divide the sandwiches among the 70 people ? but then everyone will still be hungry			0
' what about the party bags ? do i only give part bags out to my closes friends ? is n't that unfair to everyone else ? ' that is the crisis facing mother earth today			0
