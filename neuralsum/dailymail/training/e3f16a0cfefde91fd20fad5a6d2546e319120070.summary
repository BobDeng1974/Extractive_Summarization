proud father : @entity2 @entity1 has spoken about birth of son @entity4 they spent weeks grooming the media for the maximum publicity they could get			1
but now it appears that the performance artist who gave birth in front of a gallery audience has become rather shy of the attention she is receiving			2
@entity16 said that she did not expect the amount of interest for her ‘ work ’ and that she is finding it hard to cope whilst nursing her first child			1
her husband @entity22 revealed she is ‘ totally afraid ’ whilst their friends claimed she feels like there is a ‘ bounty on the picture of her first child ’			1
mr @entity1 confessed that ‘ artists like attention because it pays the bills ’ but denied that their motivation was to be famous			2
he also revealed that his and miss @entity16 ’s families had a ‘ mixed ’ reaction to their plans and that none of them had even been informed by them when it was happening - so none attended the event			1
@entity40 was born at the tiny @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 weighing 9lbs 2oz on tuesday at 10.17am			1
miss @entity16 - who said giving birth is the ' highest form of art ' - had set up a home - birth centre at the gallery and turned it into a brightly decorated bedroom with ocean blue walls and photo - imprinted pillows , along with a shower			1
according to those who attended , the space was ‘ steamy ’ and after @entity4 was born the placenta was put in a bowl that had been lying around			1
among the invited onlookers and ‘ art friends ’ were a couple expecting a baby who wanted to see what a birth would be like			1
mr @entity1 revealed that the entire process lasted around 24 hours - he and miss @entity16 , 36 , arrived around 5pm on the monday and left at 6pm or 7pm on the next day following the morning birth			1
art : the website of @entity67 in @entity42 , @entity43 , where @entity16 gave birth announced that the child was a healthy baby boy , weighing 9lbs 2oz around 20 people were there for the @entity4 ’s arrival and they helped to clean up and bring food to the new mother - including a @entity76 takeaway dinner of sesame chicken with broccoli			1
a midwife they had hired was present but there were no medicines and it was a natural birth which caused miss @entity16 ‘ the worst pain in her life ’			1
mr @entity1 , 39 , said the couple hardly slept on the first night of having their child at home and were exhausted			2
he added that his wife was ‘ very surprised by all the attention ’ it had received - even though the event had been featured extensively in the media			2
shuttered : the gallery was closed wednesday after tuesday 's ' exhibit ' , titled @entity98 , and it 's website said it would reopen with normal business hours on thursday ‘ @entity101 has been doing things like this for years and no - one has cared , ’ he said			2
‘ restaging funerals and doing all things that were very public / private and stuff			0
@entity105 that she thought would be crazy			0
she ’s a performance artist , she went to school for performance art , she ’s been doing performance art for over 10 years			0
‘ artists like attention because it pays the bills			0
there ’s much easier ways to get attention than give birth in public , that ’s pretty crazy doing it for that reason			2
‘ if you were doing this would be you doing it in some lackadaisical silly manner ? would you be doing this just to seek attention ? that ’s kind of monstrous to do that			0
‘ my wife has integrity			0
there ’s a history of people that do stuff like this in galleries and what ’s interesting in all the past one , it ’s like : ‘ this guy shot a dog in an art gallery ’ , this guy got shot by someone in an art gallery , but this was n’t somebody getting hurt in a gallery , this was a positive thing			0
‘ that ’s the difference			0
’ scene of the birth : the @entity41 in @entity152 , @entity42 , turned into a makeshift maternity tuesday ward when @entity16 gave birth to her son @entity4 , in front of a crowd of 20 non-relatives he added that some people said some ‘ really nasty stuff ’ on the internet which had upset them			1
he said : ‘ now she ( miss @entity16 ) is totally afraid because she did n’t understand it was going to be in the news			1
she did n’t understand it was going to freak people out			0
’ speaking from his home in @entity42 near to the gallery , mr @entity1 described himself and his wife as ‘ just two @entity173 artists ’			1
he admitted that both his and his wife ’s family only found out about their plans through news reports and not from themselves			0
he said : ‘ the family did not express an interest in being there but they were interested afterwards			0
my brother said afterward : ‘ why did n’t you tell me ? ’ ‘ overall there was a mixed reaction			0
my mum thought it was pretty cool that the birth of her grandson was international news ’			2
mr @entity1 said he chose the name @entity4 as an ‘ intelligence test ’ to see if people how people would react : - if they said the detergent instead of the @entity198 @entity197 then he knew they an idiot if @entity4 had been a girl he would have been called @entity202			1
all set : @entity204 is now terrified of the media attention but her painter - artist husband @entity22 spoke briefly wednesday among those who saw the birth was @entity209 who wrote on @entity211 that miss @entity16 experienced the ' unforgettable moment ' surrounded by a ' handful of randomly chosen participants '			1
she said : ' i was one of the lucky ones attending , and the atmosphere in the gallery was magical			0
i believe that all of the participants were deeply moved by this emotional , raw and true ' piece of art '			0
' i feel like the entire audience accomplished this together with @entity204 , using the commonly created positive energy			0
' @entity226 , of the @entity228 blog , said she just missed out on witnessing the birth			2
she also revealed , in a post that the baby measured 21 inches long			2
she said : ' we first received notice that the baby was coming soon at 9.34am and rushed to the quaint gallery			2
' although we were one of the select few to attend the live birth , an art performance / installation by @entity16 , we , unfortunately , did n't arrive in time			1
' what we did find when we entered the steamy space , which the artist converted into a birthing centre , was @entity16 calmly eating a banana , the placenta in a bowl and the baby 's father , @entity2 , holding his son who was wrapped in a blue towel			1
' the beautiful baby boy was wide - eyed , and as quiet as could be , staring blankly into the camera and video lenses that hovered above him			2
a video of the birth will be added to forthcoming exhibition at the gallery , and forms the start of an 18 year project which called @entity258 , where miss @entity16 will document her child 's upbringing until college with weekly video podcasts			1
@entity204 laughs as her artist - painter husband @entity263 , plays with a rubber ball that is part of the birthing room she launched the exhibition on october 8 and the gallery 's opening hours were extended so that she could develop a rapport with members of the public			0
the microscope gallery is a scruffy building located in a downtrodden part of @entity152 in @entity42			1
the one storey structure appears to be an extension of the house next to it and has a flat roof crudely fashioned out of metal			0
on the front are three black metal shutters and a black metal bench sits outside			0
on one side is a photographer ’s studio space and on the other a coffee shop which has been covered in graffiti , but over the road is what appears to be a car dump being guarded by an elderly man and his dog			0
further down the road is a small patch of wasteland whilst round the corner is a @entity300 discount store and a @entity301			0
whilst miss @entity16 ’s friends have been unsurprisingly supportive , not all of those living close to the gallery were behind her			1
@entity304 , 26 , who lives very close to the gallery and runs a moped shop down the road , said : ‘ this is just exploiting the child for the benefit of his parents			2
‘ nobody had heard of their small gallery in @entity42 before this , and now everyone knows where it is			1
‘ the baby did not have any say in how he came into this world – how do we know this is what he would have wanted			2
‘ kids can be really mean and if there is anything different about them they get teased , and this kid is going to get teased			0
‘ by the time he gets old enough to understand it then he wo n’t be old enough to care , but then it will be too late			0
‘ i think it ’s attention seeking and , even in our age of sharing everything on the @entity336 , a step too far ’			0
ready : the gallery has been converted into a birthing room for @entity204 but @entity340 , 26 , one of the owners of the @entity343 cafe next door to the @entity41 , said that he knew miss @entity16 and respected what she did			1
he said : ‘ i think it is challenging our idea about where we can be born and how it takes place			0
‘ if this had happened in the @entity354 ( of @entity43 ) there would be uproar , but people here are different and accepting ’			0
he also admitted that in a gallery was ‘ not where i want my child to be born ’ , but that he thought the attention was ‘ good for our neighbourhood ’			0
a friend of miss @entity16 said that the couple did not really understand the mess they were getting into and may have done things differently in hindsight			1
the friend said : ‘ she feels like there ’s a bounty on the first picture of her child ‘ perhaps she should have , could have thought about this a bit more and realised what would happen after the birth			1
‘ she and @entity2 are now finding it very difficult to cope with all of this attention whilst dealing with a newborn baby			2
they ’ve had enough ’			0
the friend denied that miss @entity16 was being hypocritical , but admitted that ‘ they might not have fully realised what they let themselves in for ’ .			1

@entity42 parents did n't notify their relatives before the birth of their son
healthy baby @entity4 weighed in at 9lb 2oz
mother @entity16 now ' terrified ' of the ' bounty on the picture ' of @entity4
she survived on sesame chicken during the 24 hour process
said the natural birth was ' the worst pain of her life '
