by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 05:04 est , 19 july 2013 is it really magic ? the latest device promising to give you sparkling , snowy - white teeth is the £ 45 @entity5 a dazzling white smile is a prerequisite for any celebrity hoping to make it to the red carpet			1
after all , they do n't call it a @entity14 smile for nothing			2
but not everyone can afford the mega-watt a-list look - so they are settling for a rush hour grin instead			2
the latest device promising to give you sparkling , snowy - white teeth on the go is the @entity5 -- a £ 45 treatment that has already been snapped up by thousands of commuters			1
dubbed ' the magic wand ' , the creation claims to be ideal for those looking to whiten their teeth on their morning commute			1
developed by dr @entity30 of @entity32 's @entity31 , the @entity5 is applied after the morning brush after which it needs to be left for at least 30 minutes to take effect			1
after two weeks of treatment , the wand - which contains hydrogen peroxide to cut through tooth stains - claims to make teeth four shades lighter than their original colour			1
and it may cost £ 45 for just two treatments but that has n't deterred 2,000 brits from snapping it up on the first day of sale			1
since then more stocks have been added both online and in stores like beauty chain @entity50			0
speaking about his brainchild , dr @entity30 said : ' whitening teeth is now part of our beauty and grooming regime			1
' however there was n’t anything on the market which could be used in the customer ’s time that was convenient			0
' most treatments involve using light - activating devices which means not only an unpleasant experience but you ’d have to allow an hour a day to use the treatment			2
' in this current climate we understand that people are time poor			0
we wanted to launch a product which would show the same results but be used in the comfort of everyday lives and while on the move			0
' dr @entity76 , co-founder of the @entity77 for @entity78 , said : ' it appears that the magic wand should be safe , but i ’m not sure how effective it is			0
' the jury is out for now - look back in 6 months and see if it is still as popular ; that ’s a good indicator of how effective it actually is			0
' the in - surgery tooth whitening treatment along with the home whitening trays have been proven over and over again to be consistently effective			0
' i would highly recommend this type of whitening treatment			0
' food and drink as well as poor cleaning , smoking and other factors can affect natural tooth colour and stains built up over time			2
and clearly the colour of our pearly whites is a major concern for image conscious @entity45 - and it 's big business too			0
by 2009 , @entity105 sales of whitening toothpastes had increased by 15 per cent , rising from £ 55 million in 2006 to £ 63 million in 2008			2
