with a ball at his feet and a goal in sight @entity4 has rarely failed to give @entity7 fans what they want this season			2
but when it came to a crossbar challenge against some of @entity7 finest he was left in the unfamiliar position			1
at the conclusion of an open training session for fans at @entity18 on thursday morning @entity4 lined up against @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and the apparent king of the crossbar , @entity26			1
@entity4 awaits his chance to impress in a crossbar challenge during open training at @entity18 the adage ' close but no cigar ' best represents the opening round of attempts from 40 yards			1
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity21 , @entity4 and @entity26 , ignoring attempts from his team - mates to distact him , all went narrowly over the top , while @entity38 dared to be different by hitting the back of the net			0
@entity19 did the same again but @entity41 @entity20 gave the crowd of mostly children enjoying their half term break something to cheer about as his floating shot landed on the crossbar			2
@entity26 takes his attempt in spite of his team - mates efforts to distract the skillful @entity51 @entity4 take his time with each of his three shots from 40 yards but is narrowly over the crossbar each time it was the same story as round one for the rest before a third go was approved by the fans - @entity19 took his chance as his shot dipped at the end			0
@entity4 's third go was no good but a fourth out of shot hit the mark and won a big cheer , though could n't count			0
the game ended a sucessful day for the club whose form has been mixed of late with a disappointing 0 - 0 draw with @entity72 on sunday a major disappointment			0
@entity19 is on the money with his third attempt at the crossbar challenge and celebrates accordingly @entity7 ' @entity78 - winning captain @entity77 was on hand to provide inspiration though , as were @entity81 represetnatives @entity82 and captain @entity83 , who were interviewed ahead of their @entity85 final against @entity86 on april 16			1
@entity88 's side are now preparing to host @entity89 on saturday at home as they look to launch an ambitious , if unlikely , bid for a @entity93 place , with away fixtures at @entity95 and @entity96 to follow			2
spurs currently stand sixth in the @entity98 and it appears they 'll be in a straight shoot - out for fifth place with @entity102 , who lead them on on goal difference .			0

the game ended a morning of *fun* for fans during an open training session
