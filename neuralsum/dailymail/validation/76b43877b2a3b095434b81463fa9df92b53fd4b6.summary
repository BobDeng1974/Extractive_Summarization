@entity0 is in the frame to leave for @entity2 , @entity3 has yet to sign a contract extension and can leave in 2016 and even the much - vaunted re-signing of @entity6 might have simply been a stalling tactic to wait for a move to @entity9 next summer			1
on top of all that , @entity11 , the club which charmed the world two years ago on their rampaging run to the @entity15 final , have battled relegation all season and were comprehensively beaten by @entity20 in the @entity15 last week			1
you might be forgiven for thinking that here was a club on the slide			0
but what about the notion of @entity11 in @entity27 next season ? it would seem a non-starter			2
@entity11 are starting to look up again following a nightmare start to the season part of @entity11 's remarkable 10,000 - strong support in @entity35 for their @entity37 match last weekend defender @entity0 has been strongly linked with a summer move to @entity2 for most of the world , their last sight of @entity11 's plight in the @entity37 were those infamous photos of captain hummels and goalkeeper @entity45 climbing the surround fencing to reason with angry fans from the ' @entity48 ' after the home defeat by @entity50 last month left the team bottom			1
yet the 3 - 2 win at @entity35 at the weekend was a sixth victory in a run of eight games undefeated and sparked some crazy talk			0
' now we need to focus our eyes in the direction of the @entity60 , ' said double goalscorer @entity61			2
@entity63 chairman @entity62 was a little more cautious			0
' it 's more important to put some distance between us and the relegation battle first , ' he said			2
while manager @entity67 and @entity0 struck some sensible middle ground			1
' we 're no longer in the middle of a relegation battle , ' said @entity67			2
' let 's get to the point whereby we mathematically ca n't be relegated and then let 's see how many games we have			0
' @entity0 , looking ahead to what would normally be a title - deciding clash with @entity78 , said : ' we want to beat @entity78			0
at the moment we 're in no - man 's land but we could still slip back			0
if we beat @entity78 , then we 'll see			0
' @entity6 man @entity6 has signed a contract extension but could still move to @entity9 in 2016 @entity3 ( right ) has yet to commit to a new @entity11 contract and could leave in the summer after an upturn in form , @entity11 find themselves just five points off a @entity60 place manager @entity67 ( second right ) with @entity88 and @entity89 after saturday 's win whether @entity27 is realistic or not - they are five points off the @entity60 places with eight games to play - @entity11 are in a much better place than a couple of months ago			1
no - one truly believed they could go down , yet at times they seemed intent on testing the proposition to the full			0
but @entity6 signing a new four - year contract was an enormous boost , all the more so as it contained no release clause			1
it may well be that @entity6 joins @entity9 in the summer of 2016 , the @entity105 club where his friend @entity106 already plays understood to be his preferred destination			1
even so , @entity6 should be at the @entity109 next season			2
@entity111 attempted to bring him back to @entity78 when coach there ; he will undoubtedly try to do the same again this summer , though he will have to meet the £ 35m asking price			1
interestingly , sources at @entity11 are already putting it about that £ 35m would make up for the shortfall of missing out in the @entity15 , which sounds like a pre-sale process of softening up the fans			1
the lowest point in @entity11 's season came when players like @entity0 had to front up to the fans but an upturn in fortunes has lifted them out of relegation danger - @entity61 ( left ) and @entity6 here wear masks to celebrate a goal in the 3 - 0 defeat of rivals @entity133 the @entity11 player salute their travelling support after last weekend 's 3 - 2 win at @entity35 the key question remains about the man who has come to personify @entity11 , @entity67			1
like sir @entity142 at @entity2 and @entity143 at @entity144 , @entity67 's personality , tactics and energy seem to embody every area of the club			1
understandably @entity67 is always considered when top jobs come up			0
he was on the shortlist to replace @entity149 at @entity150 but did not impress in interview - the passion that drives his teams sits uncomfortably with the increasingly corporate world of football executives			0
it looks as though those pushing for him as a natural replacement for @entity143 at @entity144 overplayed their hand somewhat			0
the intensity of the rivalry with @entity78 means he is highly unlikely to end up there when @entity164 ends his time in 2016			0
striker @entity61 poses for a photo with @entity11 fans after saturday 's win former @entity2 man @entity169 celebrates with @entity6 after scoring at @entity35 and there is a feeling that many teams are now adept at dealing with the frenzied counter-attacking style and that he needs to add nuance to the tactics that so recently shocked @entity27 's best sides			1
for now it looks as if @entity67 and @entity11 's fates are bound together			1
at times , the rollercoaster season has seemed a projection on the ups and downs of @entity67 's own volatile personality			1
yet it 's not so long ago he was a genuine wunderkind of @entity188 football			0
if he can emerge refreshed and re-energised from this season 's chaos , there seems no reason why @entity11 should n't rise again in @entity27			2
the next few weeks should tell us much			0
if @entity11 do make the @entity60 , then you might conclude that the rebuilding process is already underway .			2

@entity11 have turned around their season after *disastrous* start
the @entity37 *giants* are five points off a @entity60 place
@entity67 's team looked doomed to relegation earlier in the campaign
key men like @entity0 , @entity3 and @entity6 could leave
@entity211 *international* @entity110 will cost @entity2 £ 35m
@entity6 signed new contract but could still head to @entity9 next year
