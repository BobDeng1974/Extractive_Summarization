@entity0 has received a £ 500,000 payout from the @entity2 a senior health official accused of a cover - up over an @entity6 baby deaths scandal has been awarded a pay - out of more than half a million pounds			1
@entity0 , former deputy chief executive of the @entity2 , was alleged last year to have ordered the destruction of a damning report into why the watchdog had not stepped in to improve care at a struggling baby unit			1
ms @entity0 always denied the explosive allegation she had told a colleague in a meeting to ‘ read my lips ’ and delete the critical internal review into its failure to act on concerns about safety at @entity22 foundation trust			1
up to 16 babies and two mothers are feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the maternity unit in @entity28 general hospital			0
but , despite the failings , the @entity2 gave the trust a clean bill of health in 2010 following a two - day inspection			2
last night the watchdog apologised to @entity35 for the way they had released her name to the public			0
they said this had ‘ disadvantaged ’ her desire to ‘ protect her reputation ’ against an allegation she had always denied			2
they agreed an out - of - court settlement to pay her £ 60,000 in damages and £ 510,000 towards her legal fees - money that will be borne by the taxpayer			1
but they did not withdraw the allegation that it was likely that she was part of a cover - up			2
in a statement , the @entity2 said an it bungle last summer had meant she was not told for 18 hours that her name was to be made public			2
by this time she had been sacked from her new job as chief commercial officer at @entity62 , the internet organisation which hands out			0
the @entity2 said the mistake meant she could not defend herself against the allegation which she has always denied			2
‘ in addition , she suffered considerable distress , ’ the statement said			0
last night miss @entity0 told @entity72 : ‘ this has wrecked my life and my family ’s			0
’ since the cover - up scandal , miss @entity0 has gone into business providing ‘ reputation management ’ advice to the public sector - a move branded a ‘ sick joke ’ by one mp			2
she set up the organisation with @entity85 , the former @entity2 chief executive who was also at the critical meeting discussing the internal review			1
miss @entity85 had earlier resigned following a critical government review of the watchdog , which found it had put its reputation above patient safety			0
last night miss @entity85 said : ‘ i am delighted for @entity0			0
the fact that @entity2 have settled in the face of @entity95 ’s legal action completely vindicates us as far as i ’m concerned			0
’ the huge payout to a senior @entity2 official - equivalent to the salaries of 27 junior nurses - is likely to be met with anger from patients groups and relatives of those who died at the @entity105 hospital			1
last summer it emerged that a meeting had been held at the watchdog to discuss why it had missed repeated warnings about maternity care at the @entity112 foundation trust			0
the dispute between @entity2 and miss @entity0 was resolved with an out - of - court settlement			1
stock image used @entity116 , head of regulatory risk and quality at the @entity2 , produced a document showing that the 2010 inspection had been seriously flawed			0
an independent study by chartered accountants @entity123 , published last summer , included claims by @entity125 that she had been told to destroy the report			0
originally , none of those accused were named in the study - but the names were eventually released			0
at the start of this year , @entity35 took legal action against the @entity2 for releasing her name - and had asked for £ 1.5million , saying it had cost her her job			2
last night , in an out of court settlement , the two sides agreed that the @entity2 would hand over £ 60,000 in damages , plus a contribution of £ 510,000 to her legal costs			1
@entity2 ’s chief executive @entity141 said : ‘ in january 2014 the @entity2 ’s former deputy chief executive , @entity0 , instigated legal action against @entity2			1
‘ this was following @entity2 ’s publication of the @entity123 report into @entity2 ’s regulatory oversight of @entity112 in june 2013			2
‘ ms @entity0 ’s legal claim was based on two key elements : a libel action in respect of the @entity123 report ; and a claim for damage to ms @entity0 ’s reputation resulting from the manner in which her name was released into the public domain			1
the total damages sought were £ 1.5million			0
‘ parties to high - value litigation are encouraged to consider confidential mediation at an early stage before legal costs escalate for both sides			0
‘ as a result of successful mediation , @entity2 has this afternoon issued a statement jointly agreed with ms @entity0			1
up to 16 babies and two mothers are feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the maternity unit in @entity28 general hospital			0
stock image used ‘ in addition , @entity2 has paid ms @entity173 £ 60,000 in damages reflective of those matters set out in the statement , specifically the manner in which her name was released			2
‘ this represents a full and final settlement with ms @entity0 over all aspects of her claim			1
@entity2 has also made a contribution to ms @entity0 ’s legal costs			1
’ the two parties also agreed a joint statement			0
it read : ‘ the @entity2 has settled the proceedings brought against it by @entity0 , its former deputy chief executive			1
‘ the proceedings arose from the publication on 19 june 2013 of a report into the @entity2 ’s regulation of the @entity192 @entity191 ( @entity112 ) , produced by @entity193			2
‘ the @entity2 had previously committed itself to publishing @entity123 ’s report , which came to the conclusion that ms @entity0 may have been party to a “ cover up ” of a report into the @entity2 ’s regulation and oversight of @entity112 , something she and others have always emphatically denied			1
‘ from the interview stage , ms @entity0 and others were highly critical of @entity123 ’s fairness and processes including their interviewing , note - taking and record - keeping techniques			1
she complains that she was not even given advance notice of the allegations to be levelled at her in the interview			0
‘ the @entity2 deeply regrets its decision , taken on legal advice , to withhold the names of individuals in the report , as promised to ms @entity0 and others			1
it then had to reverse that decision after names , including ms @entity0 ’s , appeared in the media as a result of speculation by journalists			1
‘ the consequences for ms @entity0 were aggravated by the fact that some of the national media wrongly portrayed the internal report as being about maternity deaths at @entity112			1
‘ further , due to confusion caused by an it failure , the @entity2 failed to inform ms @entity0 that her name had been released until 18 hours later , by which time she had been summarily dismissed from her then employment			1
‘ the @entity2 accepts that ms @entity0 was thereby disadvantaged in protecting her reputation and giving her public defence to an allegation which she has always denied ; in addition , she suffered considerable distress			1
‘ the @entity2 wishes to take this opportunity to apologise to her and is happy to repeat what its chief executive mr @entity141 wrote to her at the time of her departure in february 2013 : “ you have been a rock of stability in @entity2 leading with passion , energy and dedication			1
you have given much , and people have testified to this ”			0
’ last year miss @entity0 complained she had been the victim of a ‘ media feeding frenzy ’ over the report			2
she said : ‘ at that meeting we agreed that the report required much further work			0
there was not a decision at that meeting to delete the report , nor was there an instruction			0
’ she said that while @entity125 believes there had been an instruction to delete her report , ‘ the other three individuals in that meeting do not recall that instruction ’			0
last night the @entity2 said the damages and contribution to legal costs are insured by the @entity272			0
a spokesman said : ‘ by going to mediation we have resolved matters in a quicker and less costly manner than by going to trial			0
