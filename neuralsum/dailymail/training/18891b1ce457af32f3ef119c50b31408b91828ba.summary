ever wondered if a super-fast football player could outrun a cheetah ? @entity2 has turned this hypothetical question into a one - hour documentary called @entity5 , which premieres tonight at 9pm as part of the network ’s @entity7			0
the wild battle of speed and endurance was staged several months ago at @entity12 in @entity13 , pitting two of @entity17 ’s fastest @entity16 players against a pair of cheetahs			1
on paper , the bipedal runners appear to be at a clear disadvantage compared to the lightning - fast big cats that can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds			1
in the past , @entity33 and @entity55 have clocked 4.24 seconds and 4.4 seconds , respectively , in the 40 - yard dash , while cheetahs @entity57 and @entity59 have reached speeds of 62 mph			1
for comparison , @entity62 sprinter @entity61 , widely regarded as the fastest person ever , set a world record in 2009 by clocking 9.58 - seconds in the 100 - meter dash - more than 27 mph			2
record times : in the past , @entity55 ( left ) has clocked at 4.4 second in the 40 - yard dash , while @entity33 ( right ) has posted 4.24 seconds for the epic race held in may , @entity68 constructed a 220 - foot - long course at @entity70 with a 10 - foot - tall barrier wall separating the human runners from their feline counterparts , @entity57 and @entity59			1
need for speed : @entity62 sprinter @entity61 , regarded as the fastest person ever , set a world record in 2009 by clocking 9.58 - seconds in the 100 - meter dash - but a cheetah would 've beat him by 3.5 seconds @entity55 and @entity33 could not see their furry foes but ran simultaneously in one - on - one heats			1
@entity33 told @entity81 that when he was approached by @entity82 with the idea to race a cheetah , he did not hesitate			2
the doubts came later when the 191 - pound running back arrived at the track and found out that the show 's producers had to build a higher barrier because one of the cheetah had leaped over the first one			2
@entity55 said during filming that in a worst - case scenario , he was hoping to outrun his four - legged rival			0
some 20 video cameras were installed along the track to capture the action from every angle			0
the filming was unscripted and shot in a single take so as not to exhaust the animals , according to the show 's producer			0
to give the @entity16 players a fair shot , @entity82 set up the races in such a way that the runners had to sprint back and forth and rapidly change directions - something that may be tricky for an animal , @entity105 reported			2
@entity12 has a total of five cheetahs in its collection			0
their handlers exercise the critters every day by making them chase a lure on a pulley to keep them fit and healthy			0
@entity57 and @entity59 were born in 2010 in @entity123 , @entity124 , and came to @entity70 in 2011			0
@entity57 weighs 90lbs , while @entity59 tips the scales at 85lbs menagerie : @entity128 ' @entity70 in @entity12 has a total of 5 big cats , among them the two racers - @entity57 and @entity59 incomparable runners : the lightning - fast big cats can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds - but quick direction changes could pose a problem			1

@entity34 running back @entity33 and @entity24 kick returner @entity23 went toe - to - paw with cheetahs @entity57 and @entity59
race was taped in may at @entity142 in @entity12 , @entity13
@entity82 built 220 - foot - long course with 10 - foot - tall wall separating players from animals
races were filmed without script in a single take not to exhaust animals
cheetahs are world 's fastest land mammals that can go 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds
