' @entity7 was born with congenital heart defect @entity81 syndrome which meant his heart valves leaked , reducing the oxygen travelling round his body			1
it made him weak - and at times blue			0
despite undergoing surgery as a baby , and making a good recovery , he grew out of the artificial valves he was fitted with and had to have a valve transplant operation last february at @entity92			2
but for @entity7 , the hardest thing to cope with was the news that his father had to return to the front line in @entity28 for six months just a few weeks after his operation - while he was still undergoing regular appointments			1
