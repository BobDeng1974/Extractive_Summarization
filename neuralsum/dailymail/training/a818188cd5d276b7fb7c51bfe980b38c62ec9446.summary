laughing all the way to the bank : @entity3 executive @entity2 while most of us were worrying about whether the @entity6 would leave us worse off , there was one man in no doubt that things had just got even better			1
@entity3 revealed yesterday that top ‘ casino banker ’ @entity2 had received a staggering £ 18million windfall			1
and the jackpot was just one share of an astonishing £ 40million bonus payout split between nine @entity3 executives			1
but the bank provoked outrage for slipping out the announcement on the same day as the chancellor delivered his austerity budget – to pay for an economic crisis caused by bank bosses			1
still , the budget cuts must have seemed like small change to the flamboyant @entity2 , who owns 11 horses which raced at @entity26 last week			2
they include @entity28 , which earned him a £ 68,340 bonus by winning the opening race , and the provocatively named @entity32			2
in all , @entity2 and his wife @entity33 own 30 horses with @entity36 ’s champion trainer @entity35 , and have won £ 588,125 in prize money this season			2
they are said to travel to @entity40 by private jet most weekends to watch the horses train			0
@entity2 , who is worth an estimated £ 57million , was a key lieutenant of disgraced former @entity3 boss @entity44			1
the 49 - year - old has managed to cling on to his job despite jointly running the investment bank when @entity3 was fined £ 290million for rigging @entity49 interest rates last summer			2
yesterday ’s jackpot , of £ 17.6million in shares from awards dating back over the past three years , is just the latest in a long line of big wins for @entity2 , who also received £ 9.7million in share bonuses last year and cashed in a £ 40million pay and share package in 2010			1
the bank ’s directors , including @entity2 , chief executive @entity60 and finance chief @entity61 , all gave up their bonuses for last year ’s work after the bank was rocked by a string of scandals			2
row : senior @entity3 staff , many of whom are based here in @entity72 , received £ 40million in payouts today , the bank announced but this week they were handed giant share bonuses awarded from previous years			1
it included a huge windfall for @entity60 , who has called for restraint on pay and promised to overhaul the bank ’s culture			0
in addition to the £ 2.6million he was paid for his work last year , he received awards worth £ 5.6million			0
critics accused @entity3 of using the ‘ lowest form of corporate trickery ’ to bury unwelcome news by revealing the ‘ grotesque ’ bonus figures on budget day			1
@entity95 of the @entity96 , a think - tank which monitors income distribution , said : ‘ just after we ’ve seen one of the bleakest budgets in modern times , @entity3 is showing its insensitivity by engaging in the lowest form of corporate trickery			0
’ @entity103 , general secretary of trade union unite , said @entity3 had made ‘ a complete mockery of any claims banks are cleaning up their acts ’			0
he added : ‘ on the day the chancellor cruelly demands more austerity from working people , to pay for an economic crisis caused by bank bosses , @entity3 bury the news that senior bankers are pocketing millions			1
’ winning the race : banker @entity2 , who is worth an estimated £ 57 million has a total of 11 horses competing at @entity26 this year ( file photo ) taking the lead : @entity28 , in the lead , won the first race of the @entity26 yesterday , making an already rich @entity2 richer @entity123 , spokesman for the @entity125 campaign group , said : ‘ a scandal - hit bank attempting to bury news of its grotesque rewards on budget day is hardly evidence of a reformed financial sector			1
' this tells you all you need to know – banks can not be trusted to put their own house in order			0
’ @entity3 was the first bank to be fined for rigging @entity49 interest rates and is facing a £ 270million fine from @entity140 regulators for manipulating energy prices			2
it also set aside £ 1.6billion last year to compensate customers mis - sold payment protection insurance			0
despite this , more of its staff received ‘ millionaire ’ pay packages last year than any bank in the @entity149 – with 428 scooping more than £ 1million			0
@entity3 insisted last night that it had not tried to bury the news of its payouts and had decided when it would release the information before the date for the @entity6 was set in december			0
a spokesman added : ‘ the share releases include deferred shares awarded from previous years ’ annual performance bonuses			0
’ winning streak : ricci with his horse @entity28 at @entity26			0
