speaking to @entity2 for an extended interview , @entity1 said the only reason revolution has n't come is that ' people do n't even know ' how the other half live			2
he told interviewer @entity19 : ' if poor people knew how rich rich people are , there would be riots in the streets			0
' ' if the average person could see the @entity28 first - class lounge , they ’d go , “ what ? this is food , and it ’s free , and they ... what ? massage ? are you kidding me ? ” ' airport lounge customers who fly @entity28 are treated to unlimited cocktails , food on demand , and other amenities including free haircuts and spa treatments			1
the comments came as @entity1 , who lives in an exclusive @entity45 community and is worth $ 70mllion according to @entity46 , built momentum for his latest commercial venture			1
