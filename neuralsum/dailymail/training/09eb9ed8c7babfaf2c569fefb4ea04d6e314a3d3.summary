a woman was landed with a £ 12,500 mobile bill after she accidentally used her phone to download repeats of sitcom ' @entity5 ' while on holiday			1
@entity7 , 23 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was hit with the huge bill after downloading just two episodes of the @entity13 comedy via her @entity15 phone			1
miss @entity7 was on holiday in @entity17 in @entity18 and using the hotel @entity19 to download the series from @entity22 onto her laptop			1
but the @entity19 connection cut out and her phone - which was hooked up to her computer while it was charging - took over the download			1
ms @entity7 was also charged over £ 2,500 for other data bundles she used on holiday , and returned home to a total bill from @entity15 of £ 12,520.87			1
the figure could buy 323 complete box sets of the all 11 series of the hit show			0
luckily for miss @entity7 her father has offered to foot the bill			1
she said : ' i 'd bought the entire series on @entity22 and wanted to download them so i had something to watch on the plane on the way home			0
' i did n't want to download all the episodes at once , so i set up my laptop to download them one at a time			2
' every day i would plug my phone into my laptop to charge , set up the downloading on the hotel @entity19 and go off for a swim			1
' i had no idea what had happened until i got a message from @entity15 on my last day of my holiday , saying my phone may have been stolen , because my bill was so large			1
she was charged £ 5,156 , 97 for one episode and £ 5,453.80 for another - a total of £ 10 , 611			0
ms @entity7 was also charged over £ 2,500 for other data bundles she used on holiday ' i had a look online at my bill , and i could n't believe my eyes - it was more than £ 12,000			1
' from the looks of things , the free hotel @entity19 must have cut out twice and my phone automatically took the internet access			1
' it 's quite scary really , i did n't press anything - i had no idea something like this could happen , and i want to warn others			0
' it 's really quite embarrassing - i had to ask my father to bail me out			0
' her @entity15 bill shows that on august 21 and august 23 , two blocks of around 900mb of data were used by @entity89 working as a modem			1
she added : ' nobody in their right mind would deliberately use such large amounts of data on their mobile - i ca n't believe that @entity15 actually sent me the bill			2
' i admit that i was using my phone quite a lot while i was away , checking emails and such , so i was expecting a larger than normal bill			2
' i take responsibility for that - taking off my data cap			0
but the size of the final bill is just ridiculous			0
surely nobody would deliberately run up such big charges ? ' i tried ringing @entity15 , but they were very unhelpful			0
the money is due to come out of my account next week , so i 'm having to beg my dad for help			0
' i ca n't believe @entity15 did n't even have the courtesy to send me a message saying i was using such astronomical amounts of data - i bet they were just rubbing their hands with glee			2
' the total came to more than 40 times her usual bill amount			0
luckily for miss @entity7 - who lives in @entity8 , her father has offered to foot the bill the bill total , running from august 20 to september 20 , came to an astonishing £ 12,520.87 more than 40 times her usual bill amount			1
she added : ' i just wanted something to watch on the plane home , my family is n't even my favourite show			0
' i realised i had n't seen the eighth series , so bought it on @entity22			0
now i 've ended up paying for the most expensive television episodes ever			0
' @entity15 say ms @entity7 's bill was allowed to escalate to over £ 12,000 because she had opted out of the 50mb roaming data cap and the £ 120 overseas bill limit			1
contact your network operator before you leave : often they have cheaper bundles or tariffs available if you know you 're going abroad ask if your network can put a cap on the amount of internet you use , to stop your bill spiraling			0
turn off auto - updating of apps or email retrieval : again this means you wo n't use any data allowance use mobile websites instead of full desktop view : this will save data per page turn off data roaming all together : if you do n't want to use the internet when you 're away @entity154 has scrapped roaming charges altogether for @entity157 customers using the company 's ' @entity160 ' service			0
it is now available in a total of 16 countries			0
others on the list include @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			0
@entity15 said they texted her on august 24 to let her know her bill had reached £ 5701.86 on the day she accidentally downloaded the first episode			2
the phone giant has since reduced her bill by £ 6,644.97 - for the data she used after august 24 until the end of her holiday			2
an @entity15 spokesperson said : ' we are clear with customers on the charges they can expect from overseas mobile phone usage			1
' our @entity191 service caps this usage and we advise customers to think carefully before they ask us to remove it			0
' we would also advise customers to be careful when using their mobile phone as a modem for their laptop while overseas			2
' if your hotel @entity19 signal drops out , the data charges will be carried over the overseas mobile phone network and as a result be added to your mobile phone bill			1
' as a gesture of goodwill , we have applied a £ 6644.97 credit to her account - the additional usage charges she incurred while using her mobile phone in @entity18			1
' but ms @entity7 said : ' they told me they sent me a text , but when i told them i did n't receive it until the end of my holiday , they said there must have been a problem with the @entity18 service provider			1
' there quite clearly was n't any problem with the @entity18 phone company signal , otherwise i would n't have been able to accidentally download the show twice			2

@entity7 , 23 , was hit with the huge bill after downloading just two episodes
ms @entity7 was on holiday in @entity17 in @entity18 and using the hotel @entity19
but the connection cut out and her mobile phone took over the download
she was handed a £ 12,500 @entity15 bill for the two episodes and other data use
luckily for @entity245 , from @entity8 , her father has offered to foot the bill
