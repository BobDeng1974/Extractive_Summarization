by @entity0 soldiers returning from fighting in @entity2 and @entity3 will be given a gene mutation blood test to assess their suicide risk			1
the trial will be carried out on @entity9 army soldiers after it was reported that suicides in @entity9 military had tripled			1
the prototype test measures changes to stress levels in the brain and has already been used on 325 civilian volunteers			2
soldiers returning from fighting in @entity2 and @entity3 will be given a gene mutation blood test to assess their suicide risk ( stock picture ) between 2004 and 2012 , the rate tripled from 9.6 per 100,000 to 29.2 , the @entity21 reports			1
scientists discovered stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called @entity27 and people with suicidal tendencies also have lower levels of the gene			1
picking up on this change could make it possible for doctors to predict a person ’s risk of suicide using a simple blood test - and monitor people most likely to harm themselves			1
the @entity27 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour			2
it ' chaperones ' stress hormones into a cell ’s nucleus so that they can work to suppress stress levels			0
yet if there are not enough @entity54 or it is altered , the stress hormone receptor can not suppress the release of the ' stress hormone ' cortisol in the brain - leading to suicidal thoughts			0
professor @entity58 , from the @entity59 said : ' suicide is a major preventable public health problem			0
' but we have been stymied in our prevention efforts because we have no consistent way to predict those who are at increased risk of killing themselves			0
' with a test like ours , we may be able to stem suicide rates by identifying those people and intervening early enough to head off a catastrophe			2
' researchers looked at mutations in the gene @entity54 in brain samples from mentally ill people who had died from suicide - and then compared them with healthy individuals			2
they discovered levels of @entity27 were significantly lower in people who had killed themselves			1
and that within this common mutation , there was a modification that changed the way this gene functioned			0
the modification added chemicals called methyl groups to the gene			0
blood tests revealed there were higher levels of methylation in the @entity27 gene for people with a record of suicidal thoughts or attempts			1
the researchers then designed a model to predict which of the participants were experiencing suicidal thoughts - or had attempted suicide with 80 per cent certainty			2
the @entity27 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour those with more severe risk of suicide were predicted with 90 per cent accuracy			1
in younger people , blood tests enabled scientists to predict whether a person had attempted suicide with 96 per cent accuracy			1
professor @entity58 said : ' we have found a gene that we think could be really important for consistently identifying a range of behaviours from suicidal thoughts to attempts to completions			0
' we need to study this in a larger sample but we believe that we might be able to monitor the blood to identify those at risk of suicide			0
' the research was published in @entity133			0

stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called @entity27
people with suicidal tendencies also have lower levels of the gene
doctors hope the test could help predict a person *'s* risk of suicide
