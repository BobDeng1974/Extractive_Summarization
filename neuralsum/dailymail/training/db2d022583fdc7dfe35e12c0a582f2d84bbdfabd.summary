a neo-nazi group created a perverted board game based on @entity2 where @entity4 people get sent to death camps so they could pass the time between murders			1
the game , where the winner is the person who deports the most to the gas chambers , has featured at the trial of ' @entity13 bride ' @entity11 in @entity14			1
@entity15 , 39 , is allegedly the sole - surviving member of the @entity17 death squad which allegedly murdered nine immigrant businessmen and a female police officer in @entity20 in a 13 - year reign of terror which also included bank robberies , bombings and weapons seizures			2
the gang called the game ' @entity27 ' - from the word pogrom meaning a violent riot that were often organised against @entity4 in @entity31 and eastern @entity30 over several centuries the @entity33 is a far - right @entity20 terrorist group which was uncovered in november 2011			1

the gang called the game ' @entity27 ' - from the word pogrom meaning a violent riot that were often organised against @entity4 in @entity31 and eastern @entity30 over several centuries - and features a skull wearing a @entity20 helmet in the centre of the board , @entity62 runic flashes and plenty of swastikas			1
@entity65 , 39 , is allegedly the sole - surviving member of the @entity17 death squad prosecutors at the @entity14 trial of @entity69 and several accomplices say she and her now - dead @entity33 sidekicks invented the game to pass away the time between assassinations and robberies			1
the aim of the game was to annihilate @entity4 life in @entity20 cities and send @entity4 to death camps			1
it became a major exhibit on day 85 of the trial which is the biggest neo-nazi process ever heard in postwar @entity20			2
prosecutors said @entity11 invented it with gang members - and her lovers - @entity86 , 34 , and @entity89 , 38			0

a police officer who investigated the game told the court : ' the idea was to get jew - free towns			2
' it features a skull wearing a @entity20 helmet in the centre of the board , s.s. runic flashes and plenty of swastikas instead of the four railway stations that feature on every @entity2 board the gang had the name of four notorious concentration and death camps : @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			1
@entity124 cards had instructions like : ' go to the next concentration camp and hand in the captured @entity4 and make the owner pay twice the normal rent			2
' on another : ' you fought off a horde of red lice using a machine gun			0
' the gang made several copies of the game which they sold to far - right fanatics themselves across @entity20 for around £ 80 a game			2
the proceeds went towards financing their life underground as they carried out their murder missions			0
the indictment against @entity11 states that the helped devise the game ' in an insidious way and identifying completely with the genocide of the @entity4 in the @entity13			1
' the trial continues .			0
