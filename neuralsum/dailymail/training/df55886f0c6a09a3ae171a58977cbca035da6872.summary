the ordeal for one of the victims began after she became desperate for love and attention because she was forced to care for her sick parents			0
so when @entity6 entered her life , bought her perfume and treated her like an adult , she believed in him			1
but the ‘ nicey - nicey honeymoon period , ’ as she described it , would last barely a year			1
after grooming her , @entity6 made sure she was ‘ out of it ’ on drink and drugs before raping her on his sofa			1
abuse : @entity6 , 38 , left , and his brother @entity6 , 33 , right , forced the young girl to have sex with one of them while she performed a sex act on the other from that moment she became his ‘ property ’ and a sex slave loaned out to abusers around the country for up to £ 600 an hour			1
over five years she was repeatedly attacked in what she described as ‘ torture sex ’			1
injected with heroin , she was sold to groups of @entity32 men who violently gang - raped her in bedsits and guesthouses around @entity36 and elsewhere			2
the victim identified as girl @entity38 for legal reasons , frequently broke down in tears giving evidence via videolink as she described her horrific ordeal			2
following the rape , @entity6 ’s sadistic attacks became commonplace and sometimes he made ‘ porn ’ movies of her			1
if she refused , he would beat her up and threaten her with weapons , once beating her with a baseball bat			0
he even raped the girl , who came from a troubled family , at the home she shared with her parents			1

pictured is a room at the guest house @entity6 and his brother @entity61 , who have been found guilty along with five other men of a string of sex crimes , forced her to have sex with one of them while she performed a sex act on the other			1
sobbing as she recalled telling @entity6 about her pregnancy , she said : ‘ he was f * * * ing fuming			1
he said i should have been a bit more responsible			0
’ given two ‘ ecstasy - like ’ tablets , she was driven to a house in @entity76 where she was forced to undergo an illegal abortion using a long hook			1
the teenager said she could not remember much of the procedure , but believes it took place on a hard living room floor			0
no doctors or nurses were present , there were no painkillers or @entity89 one occasion , @entity6 branded her flesh with hot metal			2

she was made to wear short skirts and bikini tops before being repeatedly raped			0
parties were held at which she was asked to meet the sexual requirements of up to 15 ‘ important guests ’			2

during a conversation at his home she demanded to know why he had abused her and sold her for sex			0
