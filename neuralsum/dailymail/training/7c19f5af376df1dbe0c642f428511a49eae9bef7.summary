@entity1 chairman @entity0 has labelled the war of words between manager @entity4 and @entity5 an ‘ embarrassment ’			1
@entity0 intervened on tuesday after @entity5 responded to criticism about his physical condition by the @entity1 manager			1
@entity4 , who guided @entity1 back into the @entity10 last season but is battling to save his job as manager , claimed @entity5 was ‘ three stone overweight ’ during an amazing outburst following the 3 - 2 defeat by @entity16 at @entity17 on sunday			1
‘ we regret these issues being played out in public and @entity4 and @entity5 have been notified of our disappointment regarding their handling of the situation			1
i have spoken to them both personally			1
‘ on behalf of the club , i would like to apologise to the @entity1 supporters for the embarrassment this has caused and confirm that the issue has been dealt with internally			1
‘ the club ’s focus is now on the @entity44 fixture next monday and hopefully after a tough few days we can turn a negative into a positive and build on sunday ’s improved display			1
’ @entity0 , who was at sunday ’s game , is furious that the row between the pair has been made public			1
he appeared to tweet a message in support of @entity4 ’s stance yesterday but later deleted it			1
it read : ‘ professional players must be fit			1
if i do a job i ’m ready to do the job			1
the buck stops at you			1
it ’s your body and your career			2
’ @entity1 chairman @entity0 says the spat between @entity5 and @entity4 has been an ' embarrassment ' @entity0 says he has spoken with @entity4 and @entity5 personally after the @entity1 duo 's public argument when asked about the fitness of the @entity1 's @entity5 , manager @entity4 said : ' no , he 's not fit : he 's not fit to play football , unfortunately			1
he played in a reserve team game the other day , and i could have run about more than he did			1
so no , i ca n't pick him			2
' i pick people that want to try , and deserve to be at a good football club like @entity1 , and want to work , and come in every day and want to work , and train , and show a good attitude			1
and that 's what i got today from the players			2
' when he starts doing that , whether he ever can do it , maybe he 'll get a game			2
the other lads , i 've got a fantastic group of lads here , absolutely superb , all of them			2
' i ca n't keep protecting people who do n't want to run about and train , who are about three stone overweight			1
' what am i supposed to keep saying , keep getting your 60 , 70 grand a week and do n't train ? what 's the game coming to ? the others are as good as gold			2
' @entity5 reported for training on tuesday morning , but the majority of @entity1 players had been given the day off			1
the forward , who also worked under @entity4 at @entity99 , is expected to confront his manager on wednesday for the first time since the @entity103 ’s controversial interview with @entity104			1
the @entity105 also threatened to get involved yesterday as the row between @entity4 and @entity5 escalated			1
the dispute became public on sunday afternoon when @entity4 was asked an innocuous question about @entity5 ’s absence from the calamitous defeat against @entity112 ’ side			1
@entity5 , 25 , has made only three appearances for @entity1 this season , but claims he is fully fit and ready to play first - team football after recovering from an ankle injury			1
on monday he was pictured in @entity104 lifting his top to prove he is in good physical condition			2
on sunday , when @entity4 was asked about @entity5 , he said : ‘ i ca n’t keep protecting people who do n’t want to run about and train , who are about three stone overweight			1
‘ what am i supposed to keep saying , keep getting your 60 , 70 grand a week and do n’t train ? what ’s the game coming to ? the others are as good as gold			2
’ ‘ i am a professional - this is not about retaliation , this is about protecting my reputation			1
i played in that reserve game for 90 minutes and if he did n’t think i was running he could have taken me off			2
maybe i did n’t perform like i could because it was a reserve team game and i was protecting myself			2
‘ just because we are losing games i am not going to kick the ball in the stands			2
my job is to create , bring goals to the team			2
maybe he expects me to make more tackles			2
i am not this type of player			2
i can only get fitness playing @entity10			2
you can train six or seven hours , but you wo n’t be fit			2
’ ‘ the training sessions are n’t the same standard as @entity148 , or what i would expect under another manager			1
they are not as intense , the players are n’t as motivated			0
it is the same as we used to do at @entity99 years ago			0
when we played @entity153 he told the players “ you ’re not fit , you ’re not this , you ’re not that ”			0
‘ i said “ but the problem is we do n’t have any plan in the game , we do n’t know how to press as a team			1
it ’s not about just running around , you need to play with your brain ”			0
‘ i was thinking that @entity153 did n’t have better players than us , but they were well organised			0
‘ almost every time we lose the ball the opposition score			0
we need to do something about it			0
‘ if you work as a team you run less			0
if somebody sprints 100 metres they play a triangle round him and you are never going to get the ball			0
‘ if everybody runs 10m , 10m , 10m , then you are in shape , but we never do that			0
he does n’t understand that			0
the coaches do n’t have any influence on harry - none			1
they are there just to be there			0
‘ @entity181 loves me , but i do n’t know if @entity4 listens to him			1
‘ after @entity153 he said all of the team is not fit			0
after @entity16 , because the performance was so good , he said everything was perfect - what , in one week , he changed the fitness ? impossible			1
’ ‘ i spoke with @entity188 and he told me “ what a player you are - you should be in the team every time			1
i followed you at @entity148 and you were fantastic ”			0
‘ @entity188 does n’t speak to us in training , but he watches us and then goes to watch the kids as well			0
he knows me from my days at @entity99 so we have a good relationship			0
’ ‘ i do n’t like the food at the training ground , but eat healthily like every other player			0
‘ my heaviest weight at @entity148 was 86kg ( 13st 8lb ) , my lightest 84kg - now i ’m 85kg			1
it ’s not true to say i ’m not fit			0
he tried to give an excuse			0
‘ i was desperate to play before the game			0
i was fuming when i did n’t play			0
my father was calling and my family and i did n’t pick up			0
i love football , i go crazy when i do n’t play			0
why did he talk about someone not involved in that game ? ‘ the journalist was doing his job and asking if i was injured			0
‘ he should have said “ when he is fit he will play ”			0
he is not 30 or 35 , he is an experienced manager and he should have controlled that situation			1
i did n’t do pre-season with the team because i had an ankle injury , so i was n’t 100 per cent			0
‘ this club does n’t deserve to be in the position it ’s in			0
we have fantastic owners who are there to help us , and give us everything to perform			0
‘ there are not many owners like that and they deserve better			0
they are fantastic with me and everybody			0
they are very patient too			0
‘ there is no panic , they are relaxed , want to improve , make the club better and make the fans happy			0
’ @entity5 , in action against @entity231 in the @entity232 , has made just three appearances this season the 25 - year - old claimed @entity1 first - team coach @entity181 ( left ) likes him but @entity4 may ignore his advice @entity1 owner @entity0 echoed @entity4 's comments on @entity5 but later deleted his tweet on monday			1
