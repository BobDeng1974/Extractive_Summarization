published : 10:34 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 13:03 est , 24 may 2012 breakdown : tube passengers are forced to walk along tunnels between @entity2 and @entity3 @entity5 's transport system came under fire today after a major technical failure on the @entity8 saw hundreds stuck in stifling carriages on the hottest night of the year			1
more than 770 passengers have been offered just £ 40 compensation after they had to be walked through tunnels last night because of a broken down train on the @entity14			2
there are fears the capital could become a ' laughing stock ' if similar faults are repeated during this summer 's @entity20 , which kick off in a matter of weeks			1
the faulty train was specially decorated with a bunting design for the @entity24 - but among those delayed when it ground to a halt were some of the @entity30 ’s guests on their way to a celebration at the @entity33 , attended by celebrities from the arts and fashion worlds			1
the network 's problems continued this morning when a signal failure at @entity40 led to severe disruption on the @entity43 lines			1
@entity45 and @entity46 ’s transport spokesman @entity44 said : ' the @entity20 opening ceremony is now less than nine weeks away and still ordinary commuters are being hit by delays caused by faulty track , faulty trains and faulty signals			1
' passengers on the @entity14 have endured months of shutdowns for maintenance and upgrade works that were supposed to stop this happening			2
so why are there still issues with the line ? what will happen if the chaos happens during the @entity20 ? quite simply the mayor needs to get a grip , otherwise @entity5 could end up as an international laughing stock			1
' today , in an unprecedented move , @entity65 announced it would be making £ 40 ' distress ' pay outs for those caught in the nightmare journey			1
but one passenger , @entity71 , who claimed temperatures soared to over 30 degrees , dismissed the compensation offer			1
the world is watching : a @entity8 train passes a advert for @entity20 tickets			1
recent faults have led to fears the capital could become an ' international laughing stock ' during the @entity20 the train ground to a halt between @entity2 and @entity3 just after 5.30pm			1
ms @entity71 , 27 , an events co-ordinator at the @entity84 , said : ' everyone was a bit huffy and distressed			0
' it was sweaty and horrible , i did n't have any water			1
' the woman sat next to me looked like she was going to have a panic attack			0
' she was saying that her eight year old son at home did n't know where she was and he could n't go to sleep without her being there			1
' ms @entity71 added : ' a woman in my carriage said she felt unwell and she wanted to stand between the doors , i think she had a fit			0
' ' then she slumped down on to the floor and the paramedics and police came			0
' when we got off she was sitting up with an oxygen mask on			0
' no one gave us any information , that 's what made people most worried			2
' eventually the lights flickered on and the driver said we were going to walk three quarters of a mile along the tracks			0
hush money ? @entity65 , chaired by mayor @entity114 ( pictured ) has offered £ 40 compensation to those delayed last night , but one passenger said @entity65 officials were simply trying to ' stop people complaining ' ' i was one of the last people out and it was quite bizarre to see hundreds of people stretched out in front of me			2
' it was for me even harder because i had to leap from plank to plank in my heels			0
' ms @entity71 said @entity65 were ' just trying to cover themselves and stop people complaining ' by offering £ 40 compensation			0
she added : ' this should n't be happening in 2012 that you 're stuck for two - and - a - half hours and no one tells you anything			2
' i 'm concerned about the tube during the @entity20 , because if something like this happens now , what will happens with trains full of distressed people who ca n't speak the language ? it will be hell			1
' ' sweaty and horrible ' : it took passenger @entity71 , who took this picture , four hours to get home from work ms @entity71 finally got home to @entity148 at about 10pm - more than four hours after leaving work			1
@entity150 said one patient was treated for breathing difficulties and taken to the @entity153 , while another was treated for a ' pre-existing condition '			0
another passenger caught up in today ’s tube delays said it took her three hours to travel from @entity159 to @entity160 , adding : ' there was little or no information - the only thing we were told was that we were going nowhere			1
i had to catch a bus instead - and they were all packed			0
' @entity168 , @entity8 operations director , apologised for last night ’s disruption , saying : ' this was caused by a faulty train between @entity2 and @entity172 which led to the suspension of the line between @entity175 and @entity176			2
' our staff tried to move the train , which stalled at around 1735hrs , using a train to push it from behind			0
this was not successful and we subsequently took the decision to walk passengers off the train			0
' this is clearly not the level of service our customers have a right to expect , and we will be refunding those affected			0
' @entity8 drafted in additional staff from its special requirements team to help passengers off , saying they could not be disembarked sooner as it was thought the train could be pushed forward using the other train			0
however this was not possible , partly due to the slope of the tunnel			0
@entity199 , @entity8 ’s managing director , said : ' @entity8 is staffed and maintained to the highest standards and to a level that has made it the safest significant sized railway in @entity203			0
party pooped : the @entity30 talks to sir @entity206 and his wife @entity207 ( left ) at a special ' @entity208 ' at the @entity33			1
guests on their way to the event were among those delayed last night ' the fact is that we have just recorded the most reliable year on record , carrying more passengers than ever before and operating more services			2
but we will never be complacent and accept that in the last few days our customers have not had the level of service they are right to expect			0
' that is why we and the mayor are committed to working to improve reliability even further as we go into this exciting summer for @entity5			2
' @entity224 , general secretary of the @entity226 transport union , said : ' this is shaping up to be a pre-olympic @entity5 transport week of hell with @entity5 mayor @entity114 and his officials claiming a brilliant service while millions of @entity233 know better			0
' we are paying a heavy price for a programme of cuts to staffing and maintenance that has reduced the transport system to total chaos just weeks away from the @entity20 and the blame lies firmly with the mayor and his senior officials			1
