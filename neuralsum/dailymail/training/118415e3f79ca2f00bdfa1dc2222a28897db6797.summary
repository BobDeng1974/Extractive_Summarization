in a stunning speech on the @entity2 , commentator @entity0 predicted that if a bank taxation scheme like the one that shocked @entity6 should come to @entity7 , gun owners would aim at government officials -- and shoot to kill			1
' while @entity6 can own guns , it ’s a bear to get them , ' @entity0 noted on the popular talk show @entity11			2
' there is no gun culture there , which then allows the government to wonder of its docile populace : " what are they gon na do -- shoot us ? " ' ' well , in @entity7 , ' he sniped , ' yes , we will shoot you			1
@entity7 learned monday that @entity6 would be subject to a 6.75 per cent tax on bank accounts of € 100,000 ( $ 129,500 ) and below			1
amounts above € 100,000 will incur a 9.9 per cent tax , which goes up to 15 per cent for balances over € 500,000 ( $ 647,000 )			2
' the wholesale robbery has caused citizens to rush to get their money out			0
the response ? the banks closed			0
so how can a government assume that it can get away with this ? because they assume they can get away with this			0
' ' @entity57 advocates mock gun owners over their belief that guns will protect us from government tyranny , ' said the popular @entity2 host			2
' but ask yourself this : what would happen if the government here tried to take over your bank account ? @entity69			2
' the second amendment to the @entity72 guarantees that ' the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed			0
' but new gun control measures have popped up at the state and federal level in the wake of the december @entity80 , @entity82 school shooting , which left 20 children and six adults dead			1
among the advocates of tighter restrictions on guns is vice president @entity88 , who claimed during a feb. 19 @entity90 event that women could protect themselves from attackers by firing a loaded shotgun into the air			2
@entity0 said @entity7 would revolt with their firearms and shoot government officials if the @entity7 economy ever needed a bailout like the one that the @entity100 has extended to @entity6			1
that plan requires a tax on all bank accounts in the country , seizing as much as 15 per cent of account holders ' money with a holstered gun on his side , @entity108 ( left ) participates in an anti-obama administration protest rally in defense of the @entity7 @entity113 's @entity71			1
vice president @entity88 ( right ) has supported bans on the sale of high - powered rifles , telling women they should fire shotguns into the air to scare off attackers ' @entity6 just proved that @entity88 's notion of " all you need is a shotgun " is deeply flawed , ' he said			1
' sadly , though , this " steal from the rich " mentality is alive and well in @entity7			0
remember @entity126 ? and how different is the @entity6 solution from the class warfare rhetoric that demands your wealth gets spread around ? ' the defense against this toxic ideology is n't only reason , but it 's reason with a rifle			0
so , yeah , it 'll never happen here			0
and you have the good sense of our founding fathers to thank for it			0
' @entity88 's advice about firing shotgun warning - shots became the subject of a @entity144 parody video , showing women knocked backward by the force of firing a shotgun			1
it quickly racked up 1.6 million views .			0
