@entity0 appearing on @entity12 's the @entity11 this weekend doomed @entity13 : when he was interviewed by @entity14 he said the eurozone will fail unless @entity16 agrees to underwrite the debts of struggling members but this is the first time he has confessed he would like to return to @entity20			2
mr @entity0 , now 59 , admitted his prospects of a comeback – which would be the first since @entity23 reclaimed @entity4 in 1974 after losing a general election in 1970 – were ‘ not very likely ’			0
but his determination to return to the political fray is a headache for @entity3 leader @entity28 , who will be concerned that he will be overshadowed by mr @entity0			0
in an interview with the @entity33 : ‘ i am seeing a lot of the world and i have learned an immense amount in the past five years			0
‘ one of my regrets is that what i have learned in the last five years would have been so useful to me [ as prime minister ]			1
because when you see how the world is developing you get a far clearer picture of some of the issues our country is grappling with			0
’ asked directly if he would do the job again , he said : ‘ yes , sure , but it ’s not likely to happen is it			2
’ mr @entity0 also said @entity49 had condemned @entity3 to defeat by ditching the @entity3 policies that got him elected three times			0
@entity0 , his wife @entity52 and their children have their photo taken as they say goodbye to 10 @entity4 in june 2007 he accused mr @entity49 of having him ‘ forced out ’ of power , saying he would have liked to have stayed in the job but left to avoid a ‘ bloody battle ’ with mr @entity49 ’s supporters			1
looking back to the day of his resignation , he said : ' i did n’t want to go but i felt that i had to			2
' the only choice would have been to have fought a very bloody battle internally which i thought would damage the country as well as the party			1
' mr @entity0 suggested that in some ways he is better equipped now to be pm than he was during his time in @entity4			2
' i have learned an immense amount in the past five years , ' he said			0
' one of my regrets is that what i have learned in the last five years would have been so useful to me ( as prime minister )			1
' because when you see how the world is developing you get a far clearer picture of some of the issues our country is grappling with			0
' mr @entity0 said that it was ' inevitable ' that @entity3 would go down to defeat in the 2010 general election after it became clear that , under his successor @entity49 , it did not know whether or not it wanted to stick to the @entity3 agenda he had mapped out			1
before the storm : then @entity3 leader @entity0 and his right hand , shadow chancellor @entity49 during a news conference in @entity90 in 1996 @entity49 with @entity0 on stage at the special @entity3 leadership conference in @entity93 , @entity94 when @entity49 took over the @entity95 in 2007 he predicted that the @entity96 will struggle at the next election , scheduled for 2015 , and urged mr @entity28 to stick to the centre ground			1
' my advice to the @entity95 is to sort ourselves out with a strong modern policy , ' said mr @entity0			1
' frankly you ca n’t tell what will happen , if there will be a coalition or not , but i suspect it will be far more of a two - party fight next time			1
' @entity28 has made a conscious decision that he is going to keep the @entity95 in the centre , and that is sensible			1
' despite the upheavals caused by the financial crash of 2008 - which he admits he did not foresee - mr @entity0 said @entity3 would be wrong to shift to the left			0
' my view is that you still in order to win from the @entity3 perspective have to have a strong alliance with business as well as the unions			0
' you have got to be very much in the centre ground on things like public sector reform , ” mr @entity0 said			0
' but i understand that some people think the financial crisis has altered everything			0
and the mood is against this - personally i do n’t think that ’s correct			0
