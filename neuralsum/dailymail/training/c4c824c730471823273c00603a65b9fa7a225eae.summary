it seems that the @entity1 is alive and well and living in @entity2			0
a thief who apparently was not very much in the holiday spirit stole an entire lawn of @entity7 decorations from the home of the @entity10 family in @entity11 , @entity2 , angering mother @entity12 and devastating 6 - year - old daughter @entity13			1
but now , @entity12 is getting her revenge , and all by taking the high road			0
' i wanted the people to know that i know what they did , ' @entity37			0
' i do n't want other people waking up and having their 5 - or 6 - year olds crying in tears over why their decorations were gone			2
' her sign calls out the thief for ' breaking a little girl 's heart , ' and ends by saying ' we will pray for you			2
' among the decorations stolen by the thief were numerous candy canes that lined the @entity10 ' walkway , two spiral @entity7 trees , and a light - up deer , all of which had been put outside on november 1 as is their family tradition			1
no more : this real life @entity1 stole candy canes , two spiral @entity7 trees and a light - up deer but despite this setback , @entity12 says the family 's holiday spirit will live on			1
and hopefully one @entity2 neighborhood will now be rid of that mean old @entity1 .			0

a thief stole the @entity10 family @entity7 decorations in @entity11 , @entity2
the person made off with numerous candy canes , two spiral @entity7 trees and a light - up deer
@entity12 was so upset at what the thief did , and how *sad* her 6 - year - old daughter @entity78 was , she *posted* a sign to the thief in her yard
her sign calls out the thief for ' breaking a little girl 's heart , ' and ends by saying ' we will pray for you '
