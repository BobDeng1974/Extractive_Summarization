revolutionary : the jab , which shaved two inches of waistlines of women during experiments , also helped control blood sugar levels and cut the risk of @entity7 's a dieting jab that can help women drop two dress sizes could be available within a year			1
those taking the drug liraglutide before breakfast each day lost an average of 19lb over 12 months			2
and a third of women shed 23lb – more than a stone and a half			2
such levels of weight loss can cut the risk of heart disease and other illnesses , as well as improve sleep and quality of life			2
the once - a - day jab , which tricks the brain into feeling full , also lowers blood pressure , raises ‘ good cholesterol ’ and staves off diabetes			2
and if that was n’t enough , there are also tantalising hints that the drug slows the progression of alzheimer ’s disease			2
with just one diet drug already approved for use and @entity41 among the fattest people in @entity43 , experts say that diet and exercise alone wo n’t solve the obesity crisis			1
however , the new jab will have to be proved to be extremely safe before it is cleared for use			0
@entity47 will also be a crucial factor if it is to be prescribed on the @entity50			0
the impressive potential benefits of liraglutide were unveiled at the @entity53 in @entity54 , as concern mounts that @entity41 is losing the fight against flab			1
around two - thirds of women are overweight or obese and , shockingly , a study this week showed @entity41 girls are the fattest in @entity43			1
being obese can knock up to nine years off a person ’s life and raise the risk of a host of health problems including diabetes , heart disease , stroke and some cancers			0
the treatment of obesity - related illnesses costs the @entity50 more than £ 5billion a year , with millions more lost to the economy in sick leave			1
researchers in 27 countries , including the @entity41 , tested liraglutide on almost 4,000 overweight and obese men and women			1
necessary : experts warn the obesity epidemic can not be beaten with diets and exercise alone they injected themselves once a day for a year – with some subjects taking a placebo – and all those taking part watched what they ate and exercised			1
some two - thirds of those taking liraglutide lost at least 5 per cent of their weight , while a third shed at least 10 per cent			0
for a 14st woman , this would equate to around a stone and a half – or two dress sizes			0
waists shrank by an average of two inches , levels of harmful blood fats also fell and the body found it easier to process sugar			1
there was also a drop in blood pressure , while some of the patients on the cusp of diabetes will be tracked for three years to see if the medicine cuts their odds of developing the full - blown disease			0
@entity117 ’s maker , @entity118 firm @entity116 , already sells the drug to treat diabetes and is wasting no time in trying to get it approved as a weight - loss medicine			0
it works by acting like an appetite hormone , known as @entity123 , which is made by the gut and tells the brain when we have eaten enough			0
however , whereas @entity123 is broken down within minutes of being produced , liraglutide stays in the body for hours , tricking the brain into thinking a person is fuller for longer			0
@entity130 , the only other diet drug prescribed in @entity41 , works by stopping the body from absorbing some of the fat in food			1
@entity116 has applied to the @entity136 regulator and , if liraglutide is declared safe and effective , it could be prescribed within a year			0
like all drugs , it is not without side - effects , with nausea being the most common			0
professor @entity142 , a @entity143 expert who led the latest trial , said drugs can help when diet and exercise fail			1
‘ one of the problems when people diet is that they become more hungry and their body is always trying to take them back to their previous weight , ’ he said			1
‘ drugs help people lose a greater amount of weight in the short - term and help them maintain that weight loss long - term			0

*doctors* warn diet and exercise alone will not solve @entity41 's obesity crisis
