by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 03:55 est , 5 october 2013 there are no ants in @entity4 's pants ... because she keeps a pair of anteaters in her washing machine			1
the 37 - year - old bought @entity9 seven years ago and @entity10 in 2011 to keep her company			2
and now the nocturnal pair are never happier than when they 're curled up in her washer during the day or when they 're roaming the house at night - keeping it free from pesky ants			1
she bought one of the unusual pets seven years ago and a second in 2011 @entity4 , an online administrator from @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity35 , says her besnouted pets are very intelligent and can open doors , drawers and windows			1
and they can even break into her fridge to raid their favourite snack - chilled ants			1
she said : ' i have to keep everything locked and bolted when they are not being supervised just to prevent problems			0
sleepy time : @entity4 , who lives alone with the furry pets , says she managed to house - train her first anteater , @entity24 ( pictured ) , by using a litter tray and now lets her sleep in her bed ant licker : anteaters have long tongues so they can lick up as many ants or termites as possible in the wild			1
their tongues are covered with thousands of tiny hooks called filiform papillae which are used to hold the insects together with large amounts of saliva @entity4 , an online administrator from @entity30 , @entity31 , says her pets are very intelligent and can open doors ( left ) , drawers and windows and love nothing more than dressing up ( right ) creatures of the night : @entity24 and @entity10 are of the tamandua subspecies and largely nocturnal , although occasionally go for walks with @entity4 during the day ' they ca n't be taught as easily as a dog but they will learn to do things if there 's something in it for them			1
' @entity4 , who lives alone with the furry pets , says she managed to house - train her first anteater , @entity24 , by using a litter tray and now lets her sleep in her bed			1
and the long - clawed creatures - native to the forests of @entity91 - also like swinging from her shelves in her living room			0
she said : ' one of the best things about having anteaters is they are entertaining - even when they are getting into trouble and raiding the refrigerator			2
an anteater 's life : to accommodate her pets @entity4 puts tree branches around her house for them to clamber on , and logs for them to scratch ... as well as a cosy hammock to rest in curious creatures : and they like to go for trips with @entity4 in the car where they usually spent the entire journey with their snouts pressed against the window , looking out ' you ca n't really be mad at them because they are not being bad , it 's just in their nature			1
anteaters are most commonly found in the wild throughout @entity91 and @entity123 , although smaller numbers can now be found in parts of the @entity35 they have long snouts , tongues and claws to help eat their preferred meal of ants or termites			0
their method of eating involves flitting between ant hills or termite nests very quickly , licking up as many ants as they can before they get bitten			0
giant anteaters are known to get through up to 200 nests in one sitting to sate their huge appetites			0
their tongues are covered with thousands of tiny hooks - called filiform papillae - which trap the insects in their huge amounts of sticky saliva			0
the anteater 's stomach , like a bird 's gizzard , has hard folds which contract and relax to grind the insects down - a digestive process helped by small amounts of ingested sand and dirt			0
the tongue is attached all the way down to the sternum and can flick 150 times per minute			0
' @entity24 will get into the fridge because i keep ants in there for her			1
' and she found that their favourite spot to curl up is the washing machine			1
@entity4 said : ' @entity24 used to sleep in my bed , but then she found the washing machine and loves being in there			1
' she 's learned to open the door just enough that it closes behind her when she gets in			0
' @entity10 often leaves the door open which really irritates @entity24			1
' @entity24 and @entity10 are of the tamandua subspecies and largely nocturnal , although occasionally go for walks with @entity4 during the day			1
in the wild anteaters live on a diet of ants , terminates and bees - but @entity4 says her pets have developed a taste for blue cheese			1
to accommodate her pets @entity4 puts tree branches around her house for them to clamber on , and logs for them to scratch			2
she said : ' they can be quite destructive when they get bored			0
i came home once to find they had burrowed through the dry wall			0
' and for potential owners there are more downsides			0
@entity4 said : ' @entity199 are quite smelly - people say they smell like skunks			2
' they are also very messy and their food gets spread around from sticking to their claws			0
i 'm constantly clearing up after them			0
' sometimes the dogs will follow them around hoping for food to fall off their claws			0
creature comforts : in the wild anteaters live on a diet of ants , terminates and bees - but @entity4 says her pets have developed a taste for blue cheese bed time : @entity24 and @entity10 relax in their washing machine bed with blankets to keep warm and a couple of jarres of chilled ants for a late - night snack messy : @entity4 says anteaters are smelly and very messy and ' their food gets spread around from sticking to their claws ' cute : @entity9 sits in a carrybag as it wears a jean jacket ' i was n't able to house - train @entity10 so she 's happy wetting the bed where she 's sleeping			1
' however , @entity4 is undeterred and says her anteaters make great pets			2
she said : ' @entity24 loves to spending time with me - she 'll sniff my breath and play with me			2
' we 've spent hours running up and down the hallways and wrestling			0
' she spends a lot more time with @entity10 now but she still really enjoys spending some time with me			2
