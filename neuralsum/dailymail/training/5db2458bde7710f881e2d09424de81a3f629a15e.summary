by @entity0 for the @entity1 it was from @entity3 four years ago that @entity4 received the most disappointing phone call of his professional career			1
a recent two - time winner on the @entity8 , he received the depressing news that he had been overlooked for a wildcard for the @entity11 at @entity12			1
there ’s something poetic , then , about the fact his first home @entity11 should be taking place here , of all places			1
@entity4 is all smiles again - four years on from his @entity11 snub at @entity12 @entity4 takes a look at @entity23 's new haircut at the @entity24 @entity4 talks tactics with @entity26 during a practise session on wednesday ‘ funny how things turn out , ’ he said , smiling			1
‘ given the weather at @entity12 and the fact it did n’t finish until monday , i ’d imagine it would have been somewhat disappointing for a debut			1
but you ca n’t ask for anything better than this for your first one , and in front of a @entity39 crowd			1
’ @entity40 underlined his affinity with these parts with a links masterclass at @entity44 in july to walk away with the @entity45			1
it will earn him some extra kudos from the locals and he ’s certainly looking forward to that after what happened at @entity51			1
the @entity53 ’s stirring victory over @entity54 in the singles and the three clutch putts he holed on the final three holes to snatch a win on the 18th were an essential part in the making of the miracle			2
@entity4 is looking forward to playing on home soil after a frosty reception in @entity64 but it was what happened outside the ropes that has left him looking forward to playing in front of a home audience for a change			1
‘ @entity64 is a rough , tough sports crowd , that ’s for sure , ’ he said			1
‘ there were definitely some occasions on that final day where you were thinking to yourself , “ woah , too far ”			2
but it made it all the more enjoyable the way it turned out			0
‘ the crowd can definitely have a big impact on the outcome			2
when the place went silent it really was a case of it being deafening for the @entity85			1
hopefully , we can avoid that			0
’ the belief that coursed through @entity40 following that win over @entity54 has been evident in his wonderfully consistent form since , plus that breakthrough major victory at the @entity92 last year			1
@entity4 's belief has grown since his @entity92 victory last year ‘ it ’s fair to say it was the making of me in a way , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s definitely one of those things you draw upon in the pressure moments			0
‘ straight after @entity51 i won a matchplay tournament in @entity103 against players like @entity105 and @entity106 and it has just gone on from there			0
’ he has been watching highlights of @entity51 in recent weeks			2
‘ i always know when it ’s been on at home because i get about 50 tweets from people saying how much they love watching it over and over , ’ he said			2
‘ if someone had said to me growing up that i ’d be part of perhaps the greatest @entity11 of all time , i ’d have gone , “ wow , that ’s amazing ”			2
’ @entity4 practised with @entity26 , who he is likely to partner in foursomes @entity40 practised on wednesday with the two players who will almost certainly be his partners over the weekend — @entity121 in fourballs and old mate @entity26 in foursomes			1
it ’s a lovely story how these two have gone from sharing rooms on the @entity126 in their formative days to sharing the biggest stage at the @entity11			0
could he have imagined it , back then ? ‘ i ’m sure @entity130 would have had no trouble imagining it , ’ he said , laughing			0
‘ i was just trying to hit the next fairway			0
no , it ’s great for us obviously to see how far we ’ve come			0
’ anything different he notices about @entity26 at the @entity11 ? @entity26 , @entity4 , @entity136 and @entity138 chat on the green ‘ in a regular event he gets in and does his business and leaves but at the @entity11 he ’s a lot more vocal , ’ said @entity40			1
‘ he ’s not scared of being the leader in that environment and speaking his mind			0
with his record , he ’s now even more confident of saying what he feels and that makes him a great team - room man			2
‘ a lot of guys might have good things to say but might just hold it back			0
’ @entity40 ’s two appearances , in 2008 and 2012 , have resulted in a fine record from nine matches that has seen him win twice as many games as he has lost , and he ’s surely been assigned a key role this time			1
here in @entity39 , the @entity45 champion is ready to feel the love			0
the best performance i ’ve seen ? twist my arm and i ’d settle for @entity26 last time over @entity164 in 1987 , @entity165 in 2002 and @entity166 in 2004			2
but one other might top them all when you factor in the emotional context and that was @entity171 at the @entity172 in 2006			0
as he played on following the death of his wife little more than a month earlier , everyone was in bits			0
@entity177 completed three matches against @entity105 and the rest and emerged with three victories			0
then he broke down and cried ... and drank a pint of @entity182 in about five seconds flat .			0

recent two - time @entity8 winner was overlooked at @entity12 in 2010
@entity40 is looking forward to taking on the @entity85 on home soil
@entity188 can use @entity3 crowd to their *advantage* , says @entity40
