by @entity0 published : 04:37 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 16 march 2013 a wealthy couple have run up a £ 2.7million legal bill fighting a divorce battle that a judge compared to a spat in a nursery			2
@entity7 and @entity8 were ‘ penniless ’ when they married in 1985			2
after setting up an it firm , they earned £ 41million and bought homes in the @entity13 , the @entity14 and @entity15			0
but since mrs @entity8 , 47 , a barrister , began divorce proceedings in 2010 , the couple have wasted £ 2.7million ‘ point - scoring ’ before the case ’s conclusion this week , mr @entity16 said			1
@entity8 and @entity21 ran up legal bills of £ 2.7million during their three - year legal battle which mr @entity16 described as ' puerile ' he awarded 45 per cent , or £ 18million , of their fortune to mrs @entity8 , with mr @entity21 receiving the remainder of £ 22million			1
the ruling , at the @entity27 of the @entity27 , in @entity28 , revealed that the @entity14 couple met and married when they were only 20 and 21 , respectively			0
they set up @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , 1991			0
the judge said that , as the marriage was ‘ unravelling , ’ mrs @entity8 travelled to @entity37 , with their two teenage daughters to confront her husband after learning he was at a conference with his mistress			1
the woman later went on to become his new wife			0
the couple owned a property on @entity48 in the @entity49 , @entity28 in retaliation , mr @entity21 threatened to cancel @entity52 ’ @entity13 visa and stopped her access to some of their joint credit cards and bank accounts			0
the ruling also revealed that mrs @entity8 , who lives in a £ 10.6million apartment near @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity28 , was ‘ particularly upset ’ after learning her husband planned to give her replacement engagement ring to his new wife			1
in little over 12 months , between july 2010 and august 2011 , mr @entity21 , 48 , also spent around £ 130,000 on jewellery , handbags and clothing for his lover			2
mr @entity21 , who still runs @entity33 , sold 65 per cent of his shares in the firm to a venture capitalist firm for £ 26million			0
at a previous hearing mrs @entity8 was awarded £ 26million - half of the couple ’s joint £ 52million wealth - by a family judge			1
however , fearing that after their divorce her husband could legally transfer his company shares - thought to be worth at least £ 40million - to another person , thereby denying her the full pay out , she successfully applied for a second family court hearing to agree a settlement			1
at a hearing in july last year , @entity80 described their dispute as ‘ puerile ’ , telling them : ‘ somebody has to come into the nursery to make some rules			0
’ he also expressed amazement at the ‘ completely disproportionate ’ legal bills run up in the case , adding : ‘ i simply can not understand how the parties can litigate with such profligate extravagance			0
’ he described their divorce proceedings as a ‘ bitter forensic battle ’ over their millions following their ‘ traumatic ’ separation in july 2010			1
the divorce settlement was reached at the @entity27 of the @entity27 where the judge described proceedings as a ' bitter forensic battle ' ‘ to record that this litigation has cost a total of £ 2.7million is , to put it mildly , a stark reflection of the extent to which this case has been contested , ’ he said			2
‘ each side seemed to be focused largely on forensic point scoring			0
’ yesterday ’s ruling effectively denied mrs @entity8 around £ 8million awarded in the first settlement after mr @entity16 estimated the couple ’s total wealth had fallen to £ 40.7million			1
he also decided to downgrade her share			0
however , he ordered mr @entity21 , who re-married last year and lives in @entity117 , @entity118 , with his new wife who is expecting their first child , pay his ex £ 140,000 a year maintenance until the sale of their assets and properties when a clean break could be made .			1

@entity7 and @entity8 split in 2010 and fought over their £ 40million fortune
judge *criticised* ' point - scoring ' divorce proceedings which led to huge bills
mrs @entity8 to be paid £ 140,000 annual maintenance until assets can be sold
