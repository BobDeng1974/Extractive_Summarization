@entity0 recently admitted that he never expected to play for @entity1 and always had issues with @entity4 captain @entity3 while he was playing at @entity5			1
from @entity7 swapping @entity8 for @entity9 to @entity10 ditching @entity11 in favour of @entity5 , there have always been players prepared to move to rivals			0
but some went further - vowing never to play for clubs or managers and then going back on their word			2
here , @entity19 takes a look at some of those forgetful individuals			0
@entity23 ( right ) swore he would never play for @entity1 when he was at @entity25 giants @entity8 he also said he would never play for @entity26 , but he joined him at @entity27 in 2009 @entity23 then joined @entity26 and @entity1 when he signed for the @entity29 club in 2013 @entity23 - @entity1 and @entity26 the @entity31 striker did this twice			1
after @entity8 's infamous @entity34 clash with @entity1 in 2006 in which the @entity36 club were appalled at the condition of @entity40 pitch , @entity23 said : ' never will i sign for a team trained by @entity26			1
he wrecked things completely with his behaviour surrounding the two games between our sides			0
' i insist @entity8 boss @entity48 is the better coach despite however many titles the @entity50 has won			0
' he added he would rather ' sell groundnuts in my village than to play for a pathetic team like @entity1 '			1
in 2009 @entity23 moved to join @entity26 's @entity27 and then in 2013 he again joined the @entity50 manager , this time at @entity1			1
@entity0 fights with @entity1 midfielder @entity56 during the @entity58 final in 2007 @entity0 squares up to @entity1 captain @entity3 , who he has admitted he never got on with but the @entity36 midfielder joined the west @entity62 club last summer from @entity8 @entity0 - @entity1 the former @entity5 midfielder recently admitted he had n't ever expected to play for @entity1			1
he said : ' three years ago no ( i never thought i 'd come to @entity1 )			1
it just shows you how you can never tell in life , and even more so in football			0
we had a very intense rivalry with @entity26			1
there were disagreements with him and ( @entity3 ) @entity3 too			0
@entity1 were always the team that i most wanted to beat			1
' and before his move to @entity8 in 2011 , @entity0 said : ' if some day i leave @entity5 it will never be to sign for another @entity77 team			2
' but in the summer of 2014 @entity0 did move back to @entity77			2
@entity78 said the only club he would never play for was @entity80 , he then moved there @entity78 tussles for the ball with @entity1 's @entity82 during their @entity29 clash @entity78 - @entity80 @entity78 was held up as @entity85 's poster boy when he made his debut aged just 18			1
the academy graduate was born and raised in the city and had a full understanding of the club 's rivalry with @entity80			1
when asked in an interview if there was a team he 'd never play for , he responded : ' yeah			2
' he joined @entity97 's side shortly after in 2004			2
when at @entity5 , @entity98 said that players only moved to @entity100 for financial reasons but just two years later @entity98 , pictured here playing against @entity102 , signed for @entity100 @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 also joined @entity100 like @entity98 did @entity98 - @entity100 when @entity100 were taken over , one of their first things they did was to start poaching @entity5 players , beginning with @entity104 and @entity103			1
but one player who said he would never make the move was @entity98 , who claimed he was n't interested in being a mercenary			1
in 2009 he said : ' i really believe if you are a player who thinks only about money then you could end up at @entity100			1
' you have to think if you want to play for a big club and have your image or if you want to play for a good club and earn big money			2
when you ask someone to move for something like Â£ 300,000 a week it is just crazy			0
' but just two years later @entity98 had changed his tune and joined the club			2
he said : ' i 'm really happy to be joining such a great club			0
i hope i can add to the quality we already have here because we have a fantastic squad who i believe will continue to get better			0
i ca n't wait to get started and i think anything is possible with this team			0
' @entity136 swore @entity137 would not play for the club again after he refused to come off the bench @entity137 fell out with the club and did n't play for them from late september 2011 until march 2012 but later that season @entity137 played 10 games for the club and helped them win the @entity29 title @entity136 - @entity137 in 2011 , then - @entity100 manager @entity136 swore @entity137 would not play for him or the club again after he refused to come on as a substitute against @entity148			1
he said : ' i have helped him for the last two years and i ca n't accept this from him			0
for me , he 's finished			2
i can not go on with him			0
if i decide these things then he 's finished			0
' i have helped him and now he 's refused to play			2
at @entity148 , do you think this would happen ? would it happen at @entity27 or @entity80 ? i am the manager and i make the decisions and in my opinion he ca n't play for me again			1
' i am unhappy and i should be unhappy with this			0
i will speak in the next days with the chairman @entity159			0
that is normal because he is the chairman			0
' but in march that season , after @entity137 had spent months playing golf in his native @entity163 , @entity136 brought him back into the side to face @entity1			1
he played nine more times after that in the same season , scoring three goals			0
he then played for the club 47 times the following season .			0

@entity0 said he never thought he 'd play for @entity1
@entity23 vowed never to play for @entity26 or @entity1
@entity78 claimed he would never join @entity80
@entity98 said *people* only moved to @entity100 for money
@entity136 insisted @entity137 's @entity100 *career* was over
