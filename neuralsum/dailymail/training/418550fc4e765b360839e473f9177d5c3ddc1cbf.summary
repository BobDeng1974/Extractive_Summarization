@entity1 chairman @entity0 said it was ' astonishing ' that no - one has been charged with @entity4 in almost 30 years a major inquiry has been launched into female genital mutilation to ‘ get to the truth ’ about why no - one has been convicted three decades after it was made illegal			1
@entity10 ’s powerful @entity1 is to challenge ministers and the police over why charges have never been brought against ‘ cutters ’ or families who arrange the surgery			1
prosecutors claim they are close to bringing the first @entity4 court case since the law was changed in 1985			2
@entity21 staff , teachers and social workers will also be grilled in @entity10 about what more they could do to curb the practice			1
committee chairman @entity0 said : ‘ it is astonishing that since @entity4 was made a crime in 1985 nobody has been prosecuted			1
‘ this is a concern both to the diaspora communities and also the @entity21 and it is important that light is cast on this practice and action is taken , ’ he told the @entity29			2
‘ that is why this committee is launching an inquiry into @entity4			1
we are keen to hear from any victims and those who have been affected by this practice			0
’ ‘ i am keen to hear from people about their experiences and the committee is prepared to take evidence from anyone so that we can get to the truth			0
’ the committee ’s call for evidence will ask for information about how widespread @entity4 is and what more could be done to stop it			1
last month fgm campaigner @entity53 was left in tears after an experiment intended to assess the impact of political correctness on the fight against cutting saw 19 people sign a fake @entity62 petition within 30 minutes			0
the 32 - year - old , who suffered female genital mutilation as a child , approached shoppers in @entity67 with the petition , which argued that as @entity4 was part of her culture , it should be protected			2
during the 30 - minute experiment , 19 people signed the petition and just one refused - a result @entity76 blamed on the all - pervading culture of political correctness			0
also known as female circumcision or simply as ' cutting ' , female genital mutilation involves removing all or part of the clitoris , the surrounding labia ( the outer part of the vagina ) and sometimes the sewing up of the vagina , leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood			0
@entity53 uffered female genital mutilation as a child and now campaigns against it miss @entity53 approached shoppers in @entity67 with a petition in favour of @entity4 and was shocked to find 19 people signed it the barbaric tradition has no medical benefits , and is carried out for cultural reasons , often because it demonstrates a girl 's virginity on her wedding night			1
in cultures where mutilation is common , ' uncut ' girls are considered more likely to be promiscuous , unhygienic , and prone to diseases such as hiv / aids			0
families often club together to fly professional ' cutters ' to the @entity112 from @entity113 , after which they perform mutilations on pre-pubescent girls for as little as £ 40 , often without anaesthetic , using blunt knives , razor blades or scalpels			0
it is estimated that as many as 66,000 women in the @entity112 have suffered @entity4 with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk .			0
