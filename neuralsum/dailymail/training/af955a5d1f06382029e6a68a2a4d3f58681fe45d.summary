by @entity0 published : 16:39 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 16:40 est , 10 december 2012 @entity1 claimed that tv debates ' sucked the life ' out of the general election campaign the tv debates which dominated the last general election are unlikely to be repeated after @entity1 claimed yesterday that they ‘ sucked the life ’ out of the campaign			1
the conservatives are expected to propose a single leaders ’ debate , probably taking place before the formal election campaign starts , with a different format to the three that took place in 2010			1
@entity18 strategists believe the tv debates , the first to take place in @entity21 , probably cost the party an overall majority at the last election			1
@entity25 leader @entity25 , a relative unknown compared to @entity27 and mr @entity1 , enjoyed a surge of support after unscientific push - button polling of viewers meant he was seen to have ‘ won ’ the first debate			1
though so - called ‘ @entity36 ’ faded as the campaign went on , it helped shore up the @entity25 position and enabled them to hang on to dozens of vulnerable seats , senior conservatives believe			2
the debates are also seen to have crowded out coverage of other important elements of the campaign			0
though they do not believe @entity44 would put up a strong performance in a fresh round of debates , @entity43 fear @entity48 will seek to mimic mr @entity25 ’s success by positioning him as a relative unknown against two established figures			1
mr @entity1 signalled yesterday that he wants to see changes to the format of any debates if he is to take part again in 2015			0
‘ i think tv debates are good			2
i enjoyed them last time - particularly the last one , ’ he told a @entity57 lunch			0
‘ we have a fixed - term parliament now , so we can think about it in a slightly different way			0
i have n’t made my mind up exactly what we should do but i am in favour of these debates			0
‘ my reflection on last time was that they did suck all the life out of the campaign			0
the press and all of us were interested in the run - up to the debate , the debate and the post-debate analysis , not the rest of the campaign , which i really enjoy			0
tories fear that @entity48 will try to emulate @entity25 's ( right ) success when he ' won ' the first tv debate by putting @entity44 ( left ) up against two established figures ‘ i like campaigning , i like being out there , the public meetings , the awkward moments , the difficulties - it is an incredibly exciting time , trying to explain what you are about and what you are trying to do			1
‘ i found the tv debates took all the life out of it			2
’ @entity21 ’s first - ever televised general election leaders ’ debates were staged on @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 in 2010 after prolonged negotiations between the parties and the tv companies , which resulted in strict rules on the style of questioning and the division of time for leaders ’ answers .			2
