by @entity0 on screen they are usually portrayed as mortal enemies , but a cat that was dying after eating rat poison was saved thanks to a blood transfusion - from a dog			1
the rare operation was carried out by @entity11 vet @entity10 , who realised that @entity13 the cat would not survive unless he was given an immediate blood transfusion			1
unfortunately his blood type was not known and to have performed the delicate operation with the wrong type of blood - which for cats falls into categories a , @entity21 or @entity22 - could have proved fatal			2
critical : @entity24 , @entity13 , similar to this one pictured here , was saved by a blood transfusion from a dog but decisive action was imperative because without it @entity13 was in equal danger of using up the last of his nine lives			1
@entity13 's owner @entity32 rushed him to @entity33 after she heard him howling in pain and unable to move			1
when she got there she found the blood laboratory was closed and it was not possible to determine @entity13 's blood type			1
after consulting colleagues , miss @entity10 decided to take a chance and perform the operation on the sick feline using dog 's blood			1
she said : ' if we did n't do it , he would have died , so we had nothing to lose by giving it a go			0
it was a do or die , but it 's very uncommon			0
' studies have shown that cats might not have such an adverse reaction to it no matter what the type , than they might to the wrong type of cat blood			0
saviour : a black @entity60 called @entity61 , similar to this one here , was responsible for donating the blood miss @entity10 , of @entity33 , told the @entity64 : ' @entity66 blood transfusions are not common , nor are they recommended			1
' miss @entity32 called a friend from her book club who owns a pet @entity60 called @entity61			0
she agreed to letting her dog be used for the transfusion			0
according to @entity73 , @entity13 had been ' really flat and gasping and howling ' before the operation			2
but the transfusion worked so well that an hour after the transfusion he was purring and tucking into a bowl of biscuits			0
miss @entity32 said : ' the vets just went above and beyond			0
it 's incredible that it worked			0
' @entity13 is back to normal - and just for the record we do n't have a cat that barks or fetch the paper ! '			2
