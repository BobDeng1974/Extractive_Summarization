crawling commando - style underneath an open - sided @entity2 , i came virtually nose to nose with a 4,500lb horned rhino			1
i tried to slow my breathing as she looked straight at me			1
i needed to be calm to take my shot			2
there were three other rhinos with her and , let 's be honest , they 're not called a crash of rhino for nothing			1
i raised my camera and began to photograph what could soon become an extinct pachyderm			2
the luxurious @entity19 is in @entity21 's @entity20 and is sir @entity23 's private reserve thankfully the female found my scrawny presence of absolutely no consequence , and instead wandered off in search of tastier herbivorous options			1
i was with my mate @entity29 and we laughed awkwardly as we climbed back into the vehicle			2
my mum – @entity34 presenter @entity33 – was sitting statue - still on board , having adopted her best nonchalant expression , but she was n't fooling either of us			1
the holiday at @entity38 , sir @entity23 's private game reserve in @entity21 's @entity20 , was my reward for graduating			1
i have been on safari before but this was different			2
i 'm an amateur car photographer and wanted to swap taking photos of @entity50 and focus instead on the roar of a bush lion , the yawn of a hippo , the prowl of a glorious leopard or a close - up of a fearless rhino			2
we achieved all of them			2
@entity56 came face to face with three rhinos , along with documenting the roar of a bush lion , the yawn of a hippo and the prowl of a glorious leopard just the day before , we had tracked the crash of rhino on foot			1
with 1,000 rhinos killed by poachers in @entity21 last year alone , they are increasingly difficult to view			1
@entity69 , our brilliant tracker , who could find a spelling mistake in a dictionary , had eventually located them , but with dusk fast approaching we reluctantly headed back to the @entity2			2
the @entity77 bush is not a place to be on foot in the dark			2
we 'd spent the earlier part of the day up close and personal with a pride of lions			0
our ranger , @entity84 , steered the @entity2 as close as he dared without disturbing the big cats			0
the lioness , who could have taken any one of us out with a casual swipe of her front paw , looked in our direction , checked her cubs and allowed us to stay			1
@entity84 , also a photographer , whispered advice on appropriate settings for my @entity94 to achieve the best results			0
heading back to the luxury accommodation at @entity99 , a two - bedroom apartment within @entity100 ( @entity97 described it as glamping but with solid walls , luxury furnishings , soft sheets and a chef to conjure up our favourite food ) , we talked about all the other animals we wanted to see , if possible			1
@entity56 with mum , @entity109 tv presenter @entity33 , at @entity38 , sir @entity23 's private game reserve in @entity21 's @entity111 @entity84 said he and @entity69 would try but could n't promise anything			1
nevertheless , given the conservation , ecology and anti-poaching work being carried out by @entity38 and adjoining camps , we were feeling confident			1
the following day we found ourselves slap bang in the middle of a herd of buffalo , mean - looking guys who glare at you as if you owe them money			0
@entity69 , who will happily track on foot for lion , leopard , elephant and rhino – four of the @entity129 – makes an exception for buffalo			0
@entity56 said a lioness looked in his group 's direction , checked her cubs and allowed them to stay @entity84 started up the engine and we moved on			1
pausing at a watering hole , we were delighted to see two young male elephants wandering towards us			0
they made their way into the water and proceeded to perform for us – a photographer 's dream ! we returned to the lodge to relax and sort through the hundreds of photos we 'd captured			1
chef served up kudu burgers for lunch			1
we 'd seen plenty of these handsome antelope during our morning game drive … and @entity97 decided to pass on that meal			0
@entity38 means ' place of little fear '			1
that 's because the koppie where @entity159 sits provided the ancient @entity161 warriors with the perfect lookout point @entity84 wondered what else we 'd like to see			1
' @entity164 , please , ' we cried			0
he took us on a long , bumpy drive to the wide - open plains where cheetah can run free in their hunt for food			0
they are extremely rare in this area of the @entity172 and , despite hour after hour of tracking , there were no paw - print clues			0
however , @entity84 had one last surprise			0
@entity69 heard the call of a honey bird and a solitary warning from an impala antelope			0
these led him on foot to a pair of leopard cubs frolicking up a tree			0
there is no sighting quite as magical as a leopard , and six - month - old cubs are the perfect age to provide incredible images of their playful behaviour			0
eventually , with a heavy heart and my camera packed away , we left the @entity77 bush			0
until the next time ... @entity198 and @entity199 ( vhiphotels.co.uk , 0844 573 2460 ) offers five nights at @entity201 from £ 2,669 per person			0
this includes return flights to @entity205 , internal flights and all - inclusive accommodation			0
the price is based on a june 8 departure .			0

@entity56 travelled with his @entity109 presenter mum , @entity33
they stayed at the @entity38 reserve in @entity21 's @entity111
the stay at @entity99 had luxury furnishings , soft sheets and a chef
