in a hard - hitting @entity9 message , he promised to ' get behind the workers ' and crack down on the shirkers			2
it came as he summoned @entity14 @entity13 to a private meeting , during which he will fire the starting gun for the 2015 general election campaign			1
an email sent by chief whip sir @entity19 and obtained by @entity20 to attend the gathering a week on tuesday			0
the prime minister , @entity14 chairman @entity23 and no 10 head of campaigns @entity26 will tell backbenchers that despite @entity29 's big lead in the polls , the @entity14 can still win the next election			1
sir @entity19 wrote : ' the prime minister has asked me to invite you to an important meeting to focus on our campaign for the 2015 general election			1
' mr @entity2 plans to use the meeting to boost party morale , which is flagging after dire economic forecasts , revolts over gay marriage and @entity43 , and splits with his @entity45 partners			1
according to a poll by website @entity49 , two - thirds of party members expect @entity29 to be in power after the next election , with only 12 per cent believing mr @entity2 will get a @entity53 majority			2
one @entity14 backbencher said : ' it is highly unusual for a prime minister to start an election campaign two - and - a - half years before the votes are counted			1
' there has been a severe loss of confidence in the @entity56 from some of us			1
it sounds like he intends to put a gun to our heads , saying , " back me or we will lose the next election			0
" ' he trots out his , " we 're all in this together " slogan , but it does n't feel like that when he rams through daft policies like gay marriage			0
it was n't in our last manifesto , so how can we trust him over the next one ? ' in his @entity9 message , mr @entity2 praised work and pensions secretary @entity79 's plans to strip the long - term unemployed of benefits if they refuse to take part in schemes designed to help them find work			1
@entity14 chief whip sir @entity19 has summoned senior conservatives as the prime minister prepares to launch an early re-election campaign the prime minister said : ' when people say we 've got to stop our welfare reforms because somehow it is cruel to expect people to work , we are saying no. getting people into good jobs is absolutely vital , not just for them , but for all of us			1
' we inherited a welfare system that was out of shape and paid people not to work			2
so we made some big changes , and this @entity9 almost half a million more people are in work than last @entity9			0
' mr @entity2 rejected @entity29 claims that his economic policies have failed			0
the only way to compete with the rest of the world , he argued , is to continue cutting the national debt , cut taxes and carry on with radical reforms to welfare and schools			2

' @entity123 is in a global race with countries like @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 ; a race for the jobs and opportunities of the future			2
' so when people say we can slow down on cutting our debts , we are saying no. we ca n't win in this world with a great millstone of debt round our necks			0
' radical plans to simplify the benefits system will encourage hundreds of thousands of young people to find work , a minister claimed last night			2
