by @entity0 every home in the country will have to cope with compulsory rubbish recycling schemes by next year , according to papers released by ministers yesterday			1
instructions prepared for councils have revealed a move to bring in separate collections of paper , metal , plastic and glass in order to meet recycling targets set by @entity16			1
this will mean that many homes will need more bins and any local councils which have clung to traditional weekly bin rounds – there are thought to be around 100 in @entity23 and @entity24 – will have to establish compulsory recycling systems			0
ministers have laid out plans for all households to have multiple recycling systems for glass , paper and metal although some of the materials can be collected in the same bins , documents prepared by the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) explain that this can rarely be done for glass – and claim that in other cases separate bins will often prove ‘ necessary ’			1
the push for multi-bin rubbish collection systems follows new figures which show that the amount of household refuse successfully sent for recycling is now going down rather than up			2
the statistics , which were released yesterday by @entity36 , show that in september last year the recycling rate of waste from households was 43.9 per cent – down from 44.1 per cent the year before			2
a spokesman for @entity36 said : ‘ we are working to ensure we meet an @entity53 target to recycle 50 per cent of household waste			2
figures show recycling in the @entity57 has gone down rather than up despite aims to recycle 50 per cent of waste ‘ everyone has a role to play and we want local authorities working with waste management companies to make it as easy for people to recycle as possible			1
’ but @entity65 , a spokesman for the @entity66 , said : ‘ the government has been going in the wrong direction			0
they are going to struggle to meet the target			0
a lot of people do n’t bother to recycle properly now			0
they say that if the council is n’t bothered to collect the rubbish once a week , then i ’m not bothered about recycling properly			0

ministers have laid out plans for households to have multiple bins
move comes after figures show recycling is going down rather than up
but @entity16 has set a target for 50 ***%*** of waste to be recycled
an earlier *version* of this *article* wrongly said that @entity16 had set a target of 50 ***%*** of waste to be recycled per home . in fact , as the *sub-heading* now makes clear , the target is for 50 ***%*** of the total amount of waste to be recycled .
