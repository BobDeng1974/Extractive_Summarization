by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:03 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 18:07 est , 14 january 2014 a contrite @entity3 today used his state of the state address in @entity5 to promise to co-operate with investigators who want to know why his aides plotted to exact revenge on a @entity11 mayor by snarling traffic in his town			1
' the last week has certainly tested this @entity15 , ' he admitted to a joint session of @entity18 's @entity17 and @entity19			1
' @entity20 were clearly made			0
and as a result , we let down the people we are entrusted to serve			2
' ' i know our citizens deserve better			0
much better , ' he said			0
' i am the governor and i am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch – both good and bad			0
' but i also want to assure the people of @entity18 today that what has occurred does not define us or our state			2
... i am the leader of this state and its people and i stand here today proud to be both			0
and always determined to do better			0
' still , @entity3 only spent a minute addressing what has been his latest claim to infamy			2
the text comprised less than a quarter - page of the seven - page speech			0
the balance of his presentation touted his successes – including a falling unemployment rate , pension reform and his refusal to raise taxes			0
but @entity3 's pats on his own back only go so far with observers			1
@entity11 lobbyists milling around the @entity18 state capitol building were predicting a tough day or , as one put it , ' a bridge to nowhere ' for @entity3			1
@entity78 then moved on to focus on his successes as a governor			0
but the lobbyist said ' the whole day will be about [ the bridge ] anyway			0
' the sudden closure of three bridge on - ramp lanes backed up traffic throughout the @entity18 town of @entity87 for four days in september , trapping children in school buses and angering commuters whose trip into @entity92 was lengthened by an hour or more			2
' we let you down ' : @entity3 again said he was sorry for denting public trust but said ' what has occurred will not define us ' former deputy chief of staff @entity98 ( @entity99 ) and former campaign manager @entity100 ( @entity101 , looking at @entity3 ) were shown the door on wednesday and will likely see subpoenas this week			1
@entity11 in @entity5 believe a third aide may well soon be dragged into the crisis @entity3 , the famously in - your - face @entity108 chief executive has already cleaned house , firing a deputy chief of staff and dismissing a long - time political aide who ran his 2013 re-election campaign			1
but a second @entity11 staffer walking the @entity5 capitol 's halls told @entity118 that the scandal will reach even higher in the @entity3 administration , and that @entity121 , the governor 's chief of staff while the bridge scheme was in place , could find himself behind the eight - ball next			1
' there 's just no way his chief of staff did n't know this was going on , ' the political veteran said			2
' @entity3 runs his office like he ran his @entity1 attorney 's office			1
and it 's always " do as i say , not as i do			0
" ' ' @entity3 has his entire senior staff in his office for a meeting once a week , ' he explained			1
' he gathers his staff , he gives marching orders , and when the meeting 's over every in the room knows everything that 's going on			2
' ' you 're telling me this never came up ? no way			0
' even if @entity121 was unaware , sources tell @entity118 , he faces a rocky road ahead since @entity3 has nominated him to serve as the @entity18 's next attorney general			1
a state assembly @entity19 @entity11 aide told mailonline tuesday morning that his confirmation hearing is being delayed because legislators on a hastily assembled super committee organized to address the bridge scandal do n't know if they will issue a subpoena			1
if @entity121 were attorney general when a subpoena went out , he would be responsible for enforcing it against himself , and for prosecuting himself if he refused			1
the result could create a constitutional crisis in the state			0
' it 's open season , ' an aide in the capitol confided			0
@entity166 refused to testify before assemblyman @entity168 's transportation committee on jan. 9 , citing his fifth amendment rights , but assembly democrats voted to hold him in contempt -- and now @entity168 has asked a prosecutor to charge him with a crime @entity168 , the liberal state assemblyman leading the charge against @entity18 gov. @entity3 in the wake of his @entity177 traffic scandal , announced monday that he has formed a new special investigative committee to issue subpoenas and press for more answers			1
a @entity183 poll of @entity184 released monday found that 54 per cent believe it 's ' likely ' that @entity3 knew about the plot to close the bridge lanes when it happened			2
only 17 per cent said it was ' not at all likely			0
' in the meantime , acting attorney general @entity189 remains in place , perhaps permanently			0
@entity193 , a @entity3 aide responsible for overseeing the state ' authorities unit , ' recently moved up to the chief of staff role , she has been promised			1
among the government agencies @entity193 's long - time department manages is the @entity199 , which saw two of its officials resign in december after they were implicated in the bridge matter			1
@entity204 was also the first @entity3 staffer to receive an email about the chaos the september lane closures created , and was warned that the result could be dangerous to the public			2
@entity98 and @entity166 kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful internal email on august 13 , subpoenaed documents show subpoenaed records released by state assembly @entity11 on friday show that @entity215 , the @entity199 's then - deputy director and a @entity3 appointee , forwarded a message to @entity193 just hours after three lanes on the bridge were closed off to local traffic , saying that the move created ' dangers to the public interest			1
' a contrite @entity3 apologized for the scandal thursday in a marathon press conference , but maintained that he had no knowledge of the scheme that had already brought the december resignations of @entity215 and @entity166 , the @entity199 official who supervised what he would later call a ' traffic study			1
' the governor claimed during thursday 's press event that he had no relationship with @entity166 and could not recall having conversations with him			1
' i have had no contact with @entity166 in a long time , a long time , well before the election , ' @entity3 said			1
' you know , i could probably count on one hand the number of conversations i ’ve had with @entity0 since he worked at the @entity199			2
i did not interact with @entity0			0
' on tuesday the @entity242 published photographs of the two chatting during the sept. 11 memorial ceremonies – on the third day of the bridge lane closures			0
it 's not known what they discussed			0
the governor 's presumed aspirations to be the next @entity251 are in jeopardy as the scandal has energized @entity18 @entity11 who are determined to torpedo their governor			1
' it 's open season , ' an aide in the capitol confided			0
a @entity183 poll of @entity184 released monday found that 54 per cent believe it 's ' likely ' that @entity3 knew about the plot to close the bridge lanes when it happened			2
only 17 per cent said it was ' not at all likely			0
