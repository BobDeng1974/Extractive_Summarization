by @entity0 published : 16:34 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 16:34 est , 14 june 2013 fifty years is a long time in rock'n'roll , and it 's said any old rocker who can remember back that far either was n't really there or did n't know how to have fun			1
but @entity6 insists he has a clear memory of everything that happened and did n't miss out on anything			1
as guitarist and vocalist with the @entity12 , he was there at the start of the group 's enduring success story , and in this , their golden anniversary year , is still belting out their classic hits to sell - out crowds			1
his personal high was their success with perhaps their most iconic song , @entity26			2
' i 'd found it browsing through a music publisher 's files and thought it would make a good change of pace for us			1
we went into the studio with it and booked a session musician to play keyboard			2
the @entity12 in 1964 : ( from left ) @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity6 and @entity43 ' he was a shy , skinny young man called @entity44 , later to become @entity44			1
we paid him £ 15 , the going rate for the job at the time			2
' @entity47 helped out on some of the @entity12 ' album tracks too after the departure of guitarist @entity41 , who had played keyboards when needed			1
' we knew @entity47 because he was a staff writer with a music publisher we used			0
he was writing songs well before he became famous			0
says @entity6 , ' i thought it would be a good one for the @entity12 , and asked the publisher for permission to record it			1
he told me @entity44 had recorded it himself and it was due to be released in the @entity60			1
he said , “ but it probably wo n't happen for him , so wait until it 's all over			1
” ' at that time @entity44 had had no luck breaking into the charts , with six flops			1
' well , it did happen - @entity53 became @entity44 's first big hit , and one that 's unfailingly identified with him			1
but it so easily could have been our song			0
' as well as @entity78 n't @entity77 , the @entity12 ' other songs , including first big hit @entity75 ' , just one look , i 'm alive , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , have all stood the test of time			1
almost 50 years later : @entity6 ( second right ) with the @entity12 last year @entity6 , now 67 , says modestly , ' to leave out even one of those songs when we do a show would be just plain rude			1
and we always get a standing ovation			0
does that sound flash ? well , maybe , but it 's true			1
' the @entity12 were never short of self - esteem			1
' the biggest names in pop were @entity95 and @entity96			1
we toured with the @entity96 , as second on the bill			1
' it was expected of us , as runners - up so to speak , to close the first half of the show			2
but we refused , insisting we went on just before the @entity96 , as if to challenge them to “ follow that ”			1
' did the notoriously status - conscious @entity107 object ? ' no , we were all good friends and the @entity96 never lived up to their reputation as hard men			1
' our manager was a tailor by trade , and he 'd turn up backstage , hoping to sell some clothes on the side			0
his best customer was @entity118 , who 'd buy almost everything he was shown			0
there was no real rivalry			0
but we knew our place			0
and that was immediately before they went on			0
' they were innocent times compared to the rock excesses of later years			0
drink and drugs were for the really louche			0
' we 'd spend our days in coffee bars , which were great meeting places			0
there were very few clubs to go to at night , and they were places to hear new groups rather than get off your head			0
we 'd go to parties , but they did n't really do anything for us			2
' there was very little outrageous behaviour , although i can remember us checking out of hotels in the morning and seeing the lounge piano balanced on the end of the diving board over the pool			0
did we do that ? who knows … but we never got into the really wild stuff like throwing tvs out of the window			0
' @entity6 and drummer @entity42 are the only remaining original members of the group 's classic line - up , and even they had replaced previous members as the group began to take off			1
bass guitarist @entity43 left in 1966 , followed two years later by @entity41 , to become part of the supergroup @entity159 , while singer @entity40 has retired			0
there have been many stand - out moments in the last 50 years , says @entity6 , not least an @entity162 in 1993 for their outstanding contribution to @entity166 music , and their induction into the @entity169 in 2010			2
for a group as clean - cut as the @entity12 , some of the rock wildness that was played out before them was an eye - opener			1
@entity174 : the @entity12 - ( from left ) @entity175 , @entity41 , @entity176 , @entity40 and @entity6 - at @entity177 , departing for an @entity60 tour on stage , at the @entity180 : ( from left ) @entity41 , @entity182 , @entity43 , @entity6 and @entity175 ' in @entity184 we were appearing with @entity185			1
he was a crazy guy			0
one night backstage i found a cop holding a gun to @entity185 's head , telling him to calm down			2
big trouble all round , but i never found out what that was all about			0
' @entity185 had a fantastic backing guitarist who was obviously destined for greater things			0
he got a reputation for smashing his guitar on stage and setting fire to everything			0
i ca n't see health and safety allowing that now			2
' we did try pyrotechnics ourselves , but learned our lesson when we had all these fireworks set up during one show , and they nearly took @entity41 's head off			2
we never used them again			0
in his early days @entity6 had been an apprentice electrician , playing guitar with local group @entity213 and the @entity215 at weekends			0
he says , ' there was a group called the @entity12 playing around @entity218 and they wanted to turn pro , but their guitarist , @entity220 , did n't			1
' @entity6 did , on the other hand			0
mild - mannered fun : the @entity12 celebrating : ( from left ) @entity176 , @entity6 , @entity175 and @entity223 ' so i was asked if i 'd consider replacing him			1
i got the bus to go to listen to them but could n't find where they were supposed to be playing			2
i popped into a club to ask for directions , and the place was packed out			0
the manageress said , “ oh , everyone 's here to see that new group , @entity95			2
” anyway , she told me where i could find the @entity12 , and i went there			1
for some reason i did n't want to go in , though , so i stood outside , listening to them through an air vent			2
i liked what i heard , they liked me , and it went from there			0
' @entity6 and his wife @entity243 have been married for 39 years and live in @entity244 in @entity245			0
their son @entity246 , 34 , is a @entity248 - winning recording engineer who also writes film music and plays in a band with @entity252 's son @entity251			1
@entity6 says , ' so it 's a family business now			2
when we had our first hit , we wondered if we could possibly stretch it out for two years			0
half a century has flown by and there 's still no end in sight			2
' how did the @entity12 manage to avoid the rock'n'roll excesses ? ' it 's the way we were brought up			1
we never looked for that sort of life			0
we just relied on our songs			0
and we must have done something right because we 're still here today			2
