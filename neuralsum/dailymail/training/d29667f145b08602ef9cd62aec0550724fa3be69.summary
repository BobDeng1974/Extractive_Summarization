by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 20 december 2013 updated : 18:28 est , 20 december 2013 @entity1 are facing possible legal action for defamation from the ground announcer who was stood down for allegedly making racist remarks about @entity6			1
@entity7 , video producer for @entity9 who helped out on the @entity11 for the @entity13 game , is gathering evidence in support of his case with the help of @entity19 colleagues			2
it was reported by the @entity22 media that @entity1 had acted after @entity7 had pronounced @entity6 ’s name with an exaggerated @entity25 accent			1
a @entity1 statement said they ‘ deemed the conduct of the @entity29 announcer as inappropriate and he will take no further part in the match			2
’ controversy : @entity7 has denied making racist remarks about @entity6 ( above ) at @entity13 not wise : and @entity1 , who also tweeted this picture captioned ' will the real @entity6 please stand up ? ' , could face legal action for standing him down however @entity7 says : ‘ i ’m considering my options because of the damage to my reputation			1
there is no way i mocked @entity6 with an @entity25 accent			0
i just said “ here ’s @entity6 ” loudly and in a jovial way as he came on to bowl			0
‘ ca have no evidence against me			0
we have dozens of witnesses agreeing there was no racist element to what i said			0
’ there is no recording of @entity7 ’s introduction to @entity6 nor was any complaint made by the @entity57 touring party , who had no knowledge of the fuss until it appeared in the media			2
the @entity68 ’s belated intervention into @entity69 , agent of @entity71 manager @entity70 , running the club on a daily basis despite not having passed the owners and directors test , is also expected to lead to scrutiny of @entity71 ’s transfer dealings			1
agents have complained that unlicensed operator @entity75 , a @entity77 former footballer with @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , has been acting for @entity71			2
the club were unavailable for comment on friday — not for the first time			0
not fit to own : the @entity68 intervened after @entity70 ' ( above ) agent @entity69 was running the club on a daily basis acting for @entity71 : there were rumours that former @entity88 footballer @entity87 was acting for the club , but they were unavailable to comment @entity90 referee @entity89 , who has been given three @entity92 games over @entity93 , had been a surprising absentee from the match list since november 9			1
insiders believed his lack of @entity92 games might be connected to his friendship with controversial former ref @entity100 whose comments criticising the standard of officiating this season and calls for the head of refs boss @entity105 so infuriated the @entity92			0
but a @entity68 spokesman described that theory as ‘ nonsense ’ and insisted that @entity89 , who was fit enough for @entity68 duty during that period , had a back problem affecting his foot and lacked the required fitness for the top flight			1
no problem : @entity89 has n't refereed for almost two months , but a @entity68 spokesman insisted it was because of injury and nothing else former @entity120 chief executive @entity119 , who enjoyed a ludicrous salary and bonus package of £ 640,000 in his last year , has told people he would consider a move into football			1
no wonder , as that sport also pays out barmy amounts of money , but not necessarily in @entity119 ’s direction			0
it ’s @entity132 $ pecial @entity133 left as producer of @entity136 ’s @entity135 in 2007 , but six years later he is still trying to cash in on @entity135 memories on an @entity22 theatre roadshow with @entity139 , who at least still commentates			1
less surprising is rabid self - publicist @entity140 , the @entity136 ’s cricket correspondent , planning separate @entity135 - related @entity142 tours after the @entity143 , first with @entity144 and then with @entity145			1
the @entity136 have nothing to do with these private ventures that feed off the @entity135 name , with producer @entity135 saying diplomatically : ‘ i do n’t have a view on them			2
’ off to the theater : @entity133 ( left ) and @entity140 ( right ) have been taking @entity136 's @entity135 on tour with several guests meanwhile the preposterous @entity140 has proposed @entity135 colleague @entity156 for election to the main @entity159 committee , saying ‘ his skill in expressing himself candidly would enable @entity156 to make a real and lasting contribution			1
’ this is the same @entity156 who tweeted that he did n’t think @entity163 had a stress - related illness but came home because he was ‘ freaked out ’ by @entity167			0
@entity168 , chief executive of @entity169 , has emerged as the early front - runner to take over at @entity171 when @entity172 retires after the @entity173			0
@entity79 , in command when @entity169 hosted @entity171 ’s showcase in 2005 during rebuilding work , has turned down other opportunities in racing to wait for the right opening .			0
