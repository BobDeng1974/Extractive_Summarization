the mysterious properties of asteroids have long confounded astronomers , despite the billions spent in research			1
scientists believe they the materials deep within an asteroid 's core could help unlock the secrets to how planets , like @entity11 , form			1
now a group of researchers has come one step closer to understanding these enigmatic objects by finding the first ever evidence that asteroids can have a highly varied internal structure			0
pictured here is a schematic view of asteroid @entity26			1
the asteroid surface has two distinct surface types : a smooth zone with a layer of sand or gravel on the surface , and a bumpy zone , covered with a great number of rocks the discovery was made by a team of astronomers at @entity40 who found that different parts of a near - @entity11 asteroid - called @entity26 - have different densities			1
using telescope images from 2001 to 2013 , dr @entity45 measured the speed peanut - shaped @entity47 spins and how its spin rate is changing over time			1
they combined these delicate observations with new theoretical work on how asteroids radiate heat			1
this provided the space scientists with a unique opportunity to explore its interior , revealing the complexity within its core and secrets about its formation			0
using images taken over 12 years , astronomers at @entity40 have found that different parts of a near - @entity11 asteroid - called @entity26 ( pictured ) - have different densities the @entity26 asteroid was discovered in 1998 by the @entity68 mission			1
in august 2003 , it was officially named after @entity70 , a @entity72 rocket scientist			0
the asteroid surface has two distinct surface types : a smooth zone with a layer of sand or gravel on the surface , and a bumpy zone , covered with a great number of rocks			0
in 2000 , it was selected as the target of @entity72 's hayabusa mission			0
the probe arrived in the vicinity of @entity26 on 12 september 2005			1
the probe collected samples from the surface and returned them to @entity11 for analysis			2
scientists were able to piece together the impact history of @entity26 , showing that that the asteroid had been shaped by collisions with objects ranging in size from 10 kilometers down to a nanometre			1
‘ this is the first time we have ever been able to determine what it is like inside an asteroid			0
we can see that this asteroid has a highly varied structure , ’ said dr @entity99			0
‘ this finding is a significant step forward in our understanding of rocky bodies in our solar system			0
’ the spin of an asteroid and other small bodies in space can be affected by sunlight			2
this phenomenon , known as the @entity119 effect , occurs when absorbed photons from the sun are re-emitted from the surface of the object in the form of heat			0
when the shape of the asteroid is very irregular the heat is not radiated evenly and this creates a tiny , but continuous , torque on the body and changes its spin rate			1
dr @entity99 ’s team measured that the @entity119 effect was slowly accelerating the speed at which it spins			0
the change in rotation speed is tiny – only around 45 milliseconds per year - and was far from expected			0
scientists suspected @entity70 ’s ‘ bi-lobed ’ or ‘ peanut - like ’ appearance is the result of two bodies of very different densities , that came together at some point in its ancient history			1
this research is the first time that astronomers have found evidence for the highly - varied internal structure of asteroids			1
the @entity26 asteroid , which looks like a peanut , was discovered in 1998 by the @entity68 mission			2
in august 2003 , it was officially named after @entity70 , a @entity72 rocket scientist up until now , asteroid interiors could only be inferred using rough overall - density measurements			0
this rare glimpse into the diverse innards of asteroid @entity26 has led to much speculation regarding its formation			2
one possibility is that its origins lie within the catastrophic collapse of a double asteroid , also known as a binary asteroid system			0
‘ finding asteroids which do n’t have homogenous interiors has far - reaching implications , particularly for models of binary asteroid formation , ’ said dr @entity99			2
‘ it could also help with work on asteroid mitigation , or to plan future trips to these rocky bodies			2
’ this new ability to probe the interior of an asteroid - without the need for a visiting spacecraft with penetrating radar - is a significant step forward , and may unlock many secrets of asteroids in the future			1

using images taken over 12 years , astronomers found that different parts of a near - @entity11 asteroid - called @entity26 - have different densities
images were combined with theoretical work on how asteroids radiate heat
when the shape of the asteroid is irregular the heat is radiated *unevenly*
this creates a continuous , torque on the body and changes its spin rate
the findings could help scientists plan better predict an asteroid impact
