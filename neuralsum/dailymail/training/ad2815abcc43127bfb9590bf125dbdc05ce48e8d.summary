by @entity0 @entity1 has said that some tax avoidance schemes are ‘ ok ’ as he declared nobody pays more tax than they have to			2
the @entity7 leader defended using the schemes to reduce tax bills after it emerged he is using a private company that could halve the tax paid on his media earnings			1
mr @entity1 has funneled up to £ 4,000 a month in income from sidelines such as tv appearances and on the lecture circuit into the firm called @entity20 in the @entity21			1
@entity1 - sinking a pint after his party 's @entity23 elections last week - has claimed that some tax avoidance schemes are ' okay ' , despite widespread public outrage over them it means that last year he paid only 20 per cent corporation tax on profits of £ 45,000 , instead of 40 per cent income tax			1
mr @entity1 , 50 , who set up the company in 2011 , said that criticism of the schemes was ‘ ridiculous ’			2
he said : ‘ no one voluntarily pays any additional income to the @entity38			2
most forms of legal tax avoidance are okay , but clearly some are not			0
‘ to receive money personally i have to pay 40 per cent			1
corporation tax at 20 per cent is for retained profits ( kept in the company ) only , therefore the criticism is ridiculous			1
’ the use of personal service companies is not illegal , but they have been widely criticised by politicians for being a way to reduce tax bills			0
@entity54 records show that in 2012 - 13 @entity56 , of which mr @entity1 is the only director and owns 100 per cent of shares , made a profit of £ 45,488			1
@entity61 star @entity60 faced calls to be stripped of his obe over revelations he invested in a tax avoidance scheme if this had been declared as income he would have paid £ 21,883.03 in 40 per cent income tax and national insurance			1
but by using the personal service company , he only paid £ 9,097.60 in corporation tax , and a further £ 1,687.50 on a £ 7,500 he took as a dividend , taxed at 22.5 per cent - meaning a saving of £ 11,097.93 on an income tax bill			1
mr @entity1 will be taxed on the money he has not taken as dividend when it is drawn out later , but by using the company he is able to draw it as income more slowly limiting his tax liability			1
his firm of accountants , @entity83 , based in @entity84 , @entity85 , said it was involved in ‘ tax planning ’ rather than ‘ avoidance ’ and has handled accounts for mr @entity1 since 2003			0
@entity89 , the firm 's founder , said personal service companies to reduce tax were common place			0
he said : ‘ they are used by millions of individuals in the @entity96 to operate their businesses so as to protect their personal assets and to plan their taxes sensibly			0
‘ it should not be confused with any form of tax avoidance			0
my firm does not promote or use any tax avoidance scheme and never has done			0
’ as an mep , mr @entity1 also earns £ 78,000 - a - year from @entity106 and employs his wife @entity107 on the taxpayer , on a salary of up to £ 20,000			2
in a speech last year , he took aim at ‘ a common enemy - rich people , successful companies evading tax which of course is a problem ’			2
he was criticised after admitting he opened an offshore trust fund on the @entity117 for ‘ inheritance purposes ’ , but later claimed he never used it , adding : ‘ it was a mistake			0
i ’m not rich enough			0
’ in the @entity124 race @entity122 ’s @entity121 was criticised for using a personal service company after declaring : ‘ no one should be allowed to vote in a @entity96 election , let alone sit in @entity128 , unless they pay their full share of tax			1
’ the @entity131 has also come under fire for allowing star presenters to have their wages paid into such companies , which means they end up paying less tax			1
last month there were calls for @entity60 to be stripped of his obe after it was revealed he faced a £ 20million tax bill because it was ruled that a partnership he had invested in was an ‘ aggressive ’ tax avoidance scheme , set up for the purpose of making a loss to reduce investors ’ tax bills			2
@entity1 's defence of tax avoidance is in stark contrast to @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 who have all attacked their use mr @entity1 was today in @entity155 , despite it being the last day of campaigning in the crucial @entity158 by - election where @entity7 hopes to win its first seat in @entity162			1
just hours before polling stations opened in the @entity165 constituency , mr @entity1 was more than 1,500 miles away speaking at a conference organised by the @entity167 of the @entity96			0
there had been speculation that mr @entity1 would stand as @entity7 ’s candidate in the by - election , but since he ruled that out he has appeared to have distanced himself from the contest			1
the latest opinion polls suggest the @entity175 will keep hold of the seat			0
a newly - elected @entity178 yesterday admitted employing dozens of eastern @entity23 and @entity180 workers in his family care company			2
but @entity183 mep @entity182 said that there was no inconsistency with his party ’s stance on immigration			0
mr @entity182 , who provided ‘ bunkhouse ’ accommodation for immigrants working for the company in @entity192 , said : ‘ we employed people from overseas because we could not find local workers to do the jobs			0
the bunkhouses were temporary accommodation we offered to people coming from overseas until they could get something more permanent			0

@entity7 leader says no - one would pay more tax than they had to
says he paid money into company @entity20 in the @entity21 to save cash
he saved £ 11,000 by paying *20p* corporation tax instead of *40p* income tax
