@entity0 fractured the @entity2 ’s unity over defeating @entity3 yesterday by warning he will block any bid to bomb jihadi bases in @entity6			1
the @entity7 leader indicated he would not allow @entity8 to call a fresh commons vote on expanding the @entity11 ’s current campaign targeting the terrorists in @entity13			1
until now , the @entity2 has presented a united front on dealing with @entity15			0
but mr @entity0 rejected early action in @entity6 , where jihadis have murdered four @entity19 hostages , including @entity22 aid workers @entity20 and @entity23			1
a senior @entity37 source said : ‘ @entity0 seems to have shifted			0
the question is whether it is just a shift to get him through his party conference , or something more serious			0
’ former @entity37 defence minister sir @entity43 accused mr @entity0 of being ‘ utterly irresponsible ’			2
he added : ‘ @entity0 is all over the place on this			0
he said we must do all in our power to stop these brutal killings , yet now he ’s saying that we wo n’t do all in our power			0
’ former defence secretary @entity50 said : ‘ it is very clear that the @entity7 are willing to have us fight is with one hand tied behind our back , allowing these murderers to retreat behind an imaginary line in the sand			2
this is a desperate @entity7 leader playing to the gallery rather than standing up for the national interest			1
’ @entity60 has been deployed to protect the @entity62 carrier task group in the @entity63 , using its ' world - class air defence weapon systems ' , as part of the international coalition against @entity26 @entity37 ministers have been agitating for a fresh commons vote to authorise military action against is in @entity6			1
but mr @entity0 told the @entity72 ’s @entity71 show : ‘ i would n’t advocate that we extend the air campaign into @entity6			1
that ’s why we did n’t do it last week			0
’ asked whether there would be a fresh vote on @entity6 , he added : ‘ no , well it wo n’t come to a vote unless the government proposes it , and what i ’m saying is the government is not proposing it right now			2
‘ we need to persuade the @entity22 people , indeed @entity87 as well , that every time we put servicemen and servicewomen in harm ’s way , we do so with a clear strategy in mind			0
‘ and i think the combination of air strikes and ground forces needs to be properly thought through			2
that was obvious in @entity13			2
it ’s a little bit more complicated in @entity6			2
’ aides to mr @entity0 said the @entity7 were not opposed to air strikes on is in @entity6 by the @entity100 and @entity102 countries but would not back @entity22 involvement until there was a credible @entity6 opposition able to take the fight to @entity15 on the ground – and that could take years			1
former @entity109 lord @entity108 said tackling is in @entity6 was a ‘ no - brainer ’ , as it was impossible to defeat it by focusing only on its operations in @entity13			1
he added that ‘ thousands ’ more @entity22 troops should be recruited to fight @entity115 terrorism around the world			0
lord @entity108 , who stood down as head of the armed forces last year , said : ‘ you either have to put your own boots on the ground at some point or else you have to very energetically and aggressively train up those who will do that with us and for us			1
my worry at the moment is that the scale of the challenge is n’t being met by the right scale of response			0
mps backed @entity84 plans to join air strikes against @entity26 in @entity13 by 524 to 43 , majority 481 , after more than six hours of debate in an emergency recall of @entity87 last month ‘ i am worried that without more intensive use of @entity19 boots on the ground in a support role then we wo n’t do it in the time we need to get on and do this in			1
’ relatives and friends of mr @entity20 , murdered by @entity15 last week , accused the government of doing too little to try to secure his freedom and that of mr @entity23 , who was beheaded last month			0
mr @entity20 ’s brother - in - law , @entity151 , 47 , said : ‘ they could have done more when they knew about it months and months ago			0
just the same with @entity23 – i do n’t think they did enough for him either			0
’ lord @entity108 played down expectations that the @entity157 would be able to hunt down the hostage killers in @entity6 , saying : ‘ as good as the @entity157 are , they are also rightly very cautious and i think to expect them to do that is a tall order and it needs to be part of this grander strategy			1

@entity7 leader said he ' would *n't* advocate ' attacks against @entity26 in @entity6
comes after @entity170 said he needed ' *consensus* ' before striking outside @entity13
mr @entity30 has called for @entity174 *resolution* before @entity6 strikes
former armed forces chief @entity108 said @entity6 airstrikes a ' no brainer '
