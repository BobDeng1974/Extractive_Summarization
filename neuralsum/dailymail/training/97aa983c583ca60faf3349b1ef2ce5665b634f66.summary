first impressions will count very favourably for potential buyers of this £ 3million property , not necessarily thanks to the grand house , but because of the garden pond			1
@entity5 is an eight - bedroom house built in the 19th century , sitting in more than 44 acres of prime @entity7 countryside			2
the real selling point , however , is its beautiful pond , which looks just like @entity12 's @entity11 paintings			1
spot the difference : the @entity15 bridge at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity7 which is identical to the bridge painted by @entity12 the iconic painting : water lilies and @entity15 bridge 1897 - 99 by @entity12 , which bares a striking resemblance to the pond in @entity7 at the centre of the rambling grounds and gardens is the elegant water feature with its @entity15 bridge , which could be right out of a garden in the @entity32 village @entity33 , @entity12 ’s famous home			1
the artist moved to the village in 1883 and had a beautiful lily pond which he would regularly sit and paint			2
both @entity12 ’s pond and the one at @entity38 , which pre-dates the artist ’s , have the same bridge and beautiful trees hanging over the water			1
the @entity32 , who died in 1926 aged 86 , painted approximately 250 pieces around the pond and bridge with works in galleries across the world			0
relative bargain : owning @entity50 for £ 3million is a snip compared to buying one of @entity12 's water lily paintings , which sell at £ 41million view of the grounds : the conservatory at @entity5 , from where the new owners will be able to survey their beautiful garden and pond but while one of @entity12 ’s water lily paintings sold for £ 41 million in 2008 , @entity5 is on the market for less than a tenth , with the owners asking for £ 3.1 million			1
the stunning home , in @entity17 , has a reception hall , study , drawing room , dining room , garden room and billiards room			2
on top of the eight bedrooms , there is a coach house with stables and barns as well as a tennis court , covered swimming pool , a two - bed cottage and three - bed lodge			0
it is on the market with @entity86 , who describe it as ' one of the area ’s most important homes '			0
idyllic : the sweeping driveway up to the house , which sits in more than 44 acres of land restful : a perfect country scene with the house in the background , reminiscent of the gentle landscapes painted by @entity12 luxurious : the swimming pool is discreetly set back within a walled garden and attached to an old out - building @entity105 , from @entity86 in @entity106 , said : ' the property sits among the rolling countryside on the @entity110 / @entity7 border at the foot of the @entity112			1
' although built in the @entity115 , the style of the property harks back to the @entity117 era			0
' the gardens and grounds are nothing short of glorious			0
' the bridge over the pond bears a striking resemblance to that featured in @entity12 ’s paintings of @entity33 and offers quite a bonus for purchasers			1
' the reception rooms boast high ceilings and have elegant detailing including substantial fireplaces and panelling			0
bonus : as if one big country house were not enough , it also comes with a separate guest house grand interior : the sitting room is just one of the many reception rooms that offers dramatic views of the @entity7 countryside there is also a conservatory and billiards room while the bedrooms are nearly all arranged with en suite access to a bathroom and the cellars beneath the house offer plenty of usable accommodation			2
in the mid- 1920s , the house was lived in by the @entity152 , which were behind @entity153 , the textiles business now run by @entity155 ’ den star @entity156			0
the current owners have lived in the property for around 35 years and , while they have carried out a lot of work , it could do with some updating .			0

for a tenth of the price of the painting , you could own a pond just like @entity12 's @entity169 paining - with an *accompanying* country house
@entity38 in @entity7 features garden just like @entity33 , @entity12 's home
one of @entity12 ’s water lily paintings sold for £ 41 million in 2008
