the reptile hangs in the library of the @entity3 , but was found to be in ‘ poor condition ’ so a refurbishment was ordered			1
the @entity3 insisted @entity2 the snake is a ' unique historical heirloom deserving of essential maintenance ' a team from the @entity19 spent five weeks on the work , using an expensive x-ray ct scanning machine			1
the @entity3 , which is cutting its budget by a quarter over four years , defended the work , saying the snake had not been restuffed for up to 50 years			1
the snake is thought to have been presented by a @entity26 , in what is now @entity28 , to the colonial secretary in the 19th century			1
according to the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , exact names and dates are unknown but @entity2 was pictured in @entity33 building in 1892			1
tonight mr @entity4 was unavailable to defend the £ 10,000 bill personally			0
officials said he was hosting @entity37 president @entity36 on a state visit			0
but a @entity3 spokesman tried to justify defended the cost , admitting it was ' quite a bit of money but he is a very big snake '			1
he added : ' we will not be constricted nor will we scale back in our dedicated to preserving this historic national treasure			1
this will preserve him for posterity			2
foreign secretary @entity4 signed off the restuffing of the snake , which he complained was the only thing left in the @entity3 library after being run down by @entity52 ' @entity2 is a unique historic heirloom deserving essential maintenance to an appropriate standard after decades of neglect			1
' responding to a @entity59 request by the @entity61 website , the ministry added : ‘ as a gift to the @entity3 , @entity2 is therefore regarded as an @entity3 asset			1
as such , the @entity3 is obliged to maintain its assets , and the work on @entity2 was essential maintenance			1
‘ it is believed that @entity2 was first re-stuffed in the 1960s or 1970s , but there are no records of how much it cost on that occasion			0
certainly no significant maintenance has been carried out on him in the last 40 - 50 years			2
‘ @entity2 was never housed in a glass case , as is commonly believed			0
in moving him from his suspended position in the @entity75 ( a separate @entity75 area to the old @entity77 referenced above ) to facilitate planned refurbishment to the area it was observed he was in poor condition			0
‘ a decision was taken to use this opportunity to carry out a refurbishment to ‘ @entity2 ’ including a safety check on the suspension fittings			0
the cost of the conservation and restoration work on ‘ @entity2 ’ was £ 10,000			0

’ in a speech last year mr @entity4 criticised his @entity52 predecessors for stripping the @entity3 library of its 6,000 books			1
he said : ‘ it is ironic that the only object to survive the gutting of the library is a one hundred year old twenty - foot stuffed anaconda known as @entity2 , who remains suspended over the empty bookshelves , while the books from the period when such an unusual foreign gift found its way into the @entity3 have been dismantled around it , and can never be reassembled			1
officials said @entity2 had been photographed in the @entity3 on @entity33 120 years ago ‘ to my mind the fate of the @entity3 library is emblematic of a gradual hollowing out of the qualities that made the @entity3 one of our great institutions			1
’ in may 2011 lord @entity120 , the former head of the diplomatic service , demanded to know what had become of @entity2			0
@entity124 foreign office minister @entity123 of @entity125 , who is @entity126 ’s father - in - law , told the peer : ‘ @entity2 , the 20 - foot long stuffed anaconda , has graced the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) library for over a century			1
he remains proudly in place , just as he did throughout the noble lord 's distinguished career in the @entity3 , and continues to be held in great affection by @entity3 staff			2
‘ we have no plans for @entity2 other than to clean and stuff him from time to time			0
’ at some considerable cost , it turns out			0
