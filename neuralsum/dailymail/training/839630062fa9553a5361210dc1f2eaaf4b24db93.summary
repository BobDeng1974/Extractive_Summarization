no vaccine : if the new strain of swine flu was released , it could kill up to a billion people what was extraordinary about the great flu pandemic of 2018 was not only that it came exactly 100 years after the @entity9 flu of 1918 , but that it also killed 5 per cent of the world ’s population			1
in 1918 , that proportion meant some 100 million people			2
in 2018 , nearly 400 million fell victim			0
of those , some one million were in @entity16			0
nearly every family lost a loved one , with children and the elderly being particularly vulnerable			0
the @entity21 was unable to cope with the sheer numbers infected , which ran to around ten million — almost a sixth of the population			0
with no vaccine available , all that doctors could do was to send people home and tell them to hope for the best			1
it was the worst natural disaster the world had ever seen			0
but the virus was no random creation of @entity35 — it was man - made , produced by an obscure professor at a university deep in the heart of the @entity40 this may sound like a science - fiction scenario that would strain credulity but , terrifyingly , it is all too possible			1
professor @entity45 of the @entity46 has created a deadly new strain of the 2009 swine flu virus — for which there is no known vaccine			1
if the virus escaped from professor @entity45 ’s laboratory it could kill hundreds of millions — perhaps even a billion			1
worryingly , scientists seem as alarmed as the general public			0
professor @entity45 revealed what he had done at a secret meeting held earlier this year , and his fellow virologists appear to have reacted with despair			1
‘ he ’s basically got a known pandemic strain that is now resistant to vaccination , ’ said one scientist who did not wish to be named			2
‘ everything he did before was dangerous , but this is even madder			2
’ so what exactly has professor @entity45 done before ? only last month @entity45 revealed in a scientific paper that he had also synthesised a bird flu virus — called ‘ 1918 - like @entity71 ’			1
he had created , through a process called ‘ reverse genetics ’ , a flu virus extremely similar to that which caused the @entity77			1
@entity45 and his team declared that they had made the virus to assess whether variants of the 1918 flu were as deadly to humans as the original virus			1
after testing it on ferrets , the team found that what they had created , in the dry words of academia , ‘ may have pandemic potential ’			2
a patient is given a swine flu vaccination			1
compared to the outbreak in 1918 , @entity94 has so far been relatively merciful			0
to date , only some 400 people worldwide have died from the virus an earlier experiment looked at making another lethal bird flu strain easier to catch			1
the idea that scientists blithely create deadly flu viruses , essentially to see how deadly they are , caused outrage in the scientific community and the world at large			1
‘ the work they are doing is absolutely crazy , ’ said professor lord may of @entity108 , a former president of the @entity110			2
‘ the whole thing is exceedingly dangerous			1
’ @entity114 , professor of epidemiology at the @entity116 , said : ‘ i am worried that this signals a growing trend to make “ transmissible ” novel viruses willy - nilly			1
this is a risky activity , even in the safest labs			0
‘ scientists should not take such risks without strong evidence that the work could save lives , which this paper does not provide			0
’ other scientists used stronger language			0
‘ if society understood what was going on , ’ thundered professor @entity130 , of the @entity131 at the @entity132 in @entity133 , ‘ they would say “ what the @entity137 are you doing ? ” ’ it ’s a good question			2
professor @entity45 did try to justify his research last month			1
he explained that wild birds continue to harbour many variants of the influenza a virus — the strain of virus that can be transmitted from birds , including domestic poultry , through to humans			1
one of the subtypes of influenza a is called @entity94 — a name familiar to many			2
not only was a form of @entity94 behind the 1918 outbreak , but its variants have started to emerge over the past ten years , and are now collectively known as ‘ bird flu ’			2
compared to the outbreak in 1918 , @entity94 has so far been relatively merciful			0
to date , only some 400 people worldwide have died from the virus			1
however , this is not to say that a new form of @entity94 could not be more deadly , and there are many virologists around the world working on ways to deal with potential pandemics			0
professor @entity45 argues that ‘ foreseeing and understanding this potential is important for effective surveillance ’			1
@entity45 and his team create new forms of @entity94 , then study how they function and how easily they can spread			1
naturally , the experiments are carried out in extremely secure conditions to do this , @entity45 and his team create new forms of @entity94 , then study how they function and how easily they can spread			2
naturally , the experiments are carried out in extremely secure conditions — although it is alarming to learn that professor @entity45 ’s @entity181 at the @entity46 is not rated at the most secure level			1
laboratories that work with deadly biological agents are graded with increasing levels of biosafety , which range from @entity187 - 1 up to @entity187 - 4			2
establishments rated at @entity187 include the @entity189 at @entity190 in @entity191 , and the new @entity192 in @entity193 in the @entity40 professor @entity45 ’s lab is rated at @entity195			1
under the strict guidelines , the entrance to the laboratory must be through two sets of self - closing and locking doors , and no air must escape from it			2
all procedures must be carried out inside a closed biological safety cabinet , into which scientists insert their hands and arms cased in latex gloves			0
often , respirators must be worn , and all staff members are medically screened , and immunised when possible			0
however some scientists are adamant that the risks are still too high			0
in a paper published in 2012 , @entity214 , a senior science fellow at the @entity215 for @entity216 and non-proliferation , stated that 42 institutions were working with any number of three potentially deadly disease - causing substances — smallpox , the sars virus , and @entity94			2
@entity214 estimated there was an 80 per cent likelihood of one of these diseases escaping from one of these laboratories in just under every 13 years			0
‘ this level of risk is clearly unacceptable , ’ @entity214 said			0
however , @entity214 ’s work did not take account of another danger — one that makes the risk of a genetically manipulated virus breaking free from a lab even more likely : terrorism			0
even though the idea that , say , @entity243 , might break into laboratories to release strains of @entity94 seems far - fetched , it is taken very seriously by policymakers			0
a visual representation of the @entity94 strain of bird flu			2
even though the idea that , say , @entity243 , might break into laboratories to release strains of @entity94 seems far - fetched , it is taken very seriously by policymakers in 2011 , the @entity40 @entity254 called for scientific papers on @entity94 to be censored , which caused fierce debate among scientists			1
because of such fears , in 2012 many scientists voluntarily halted research on @entity94			0
the moratorium lasted for a year , after which the virologists lifted it , stating that the risks from not studying the virus were greater than those raised by the virus falling into the wrong hands			0
however , many scientists remain deeply uncomfortable with the way some research is carried out on @entity94			0
those doubts are sure to be repeated with the latest revelations about professor @entity45			1
some , such as professor @entity114 , advocate what he calls ‘ ethical alternatives ’ to the type of approach used by @entity280 , in which more rigorous risk assessments should be made			0
‘ in the case of influenza , we anticipate that such a risk assessment will show that the risks are unjustifiable , ’ professor @entity114 states in a paper he published last month			0
but despite such calls from their academic colleagues , @entity45 and other scientists , such as professor @entity292 at @entity293 in @entity294 , insist that what they are doing is right , and maintain that their work is safe and therefore ethical			1
but as every scientist knows , there is no such thing as a sure bet			0
there is always a chance that , one day , someone will walk out of professor @entity45 ’s laboratory in @entity307 feeling under the weather			1
if that happens , then we must hope and pray that those same scientists find a cure — before millions die .			0

professor @entity45 created a new strain of 2009 swine flu virus
if virus escaped it could kill up to a billion people - there is no known vaccine
professor @entity45 argues that it is part of *valuable* scientific research
others in the field have called the experiment ' exceedingly dangerous '
