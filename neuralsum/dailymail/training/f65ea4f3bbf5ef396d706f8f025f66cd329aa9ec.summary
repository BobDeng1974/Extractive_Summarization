@entity0 has said her two divorces have taught her children valuable life lessons - but not all parents would agree			1
her comments sparked a heated debate on @entity8 's @entity7 , with women with entirely opposing views battle it out over the question of whether divorce can ever be good for children			1
the question has also been hotly discussed on online parenting forums since the star told @entity18 : ' i think it ’s very important to teach your children to struggle on some level			1
but mum - of - one , @entity33 , disagreed the actress , 39 , has three children : @entity36 , 14 , from her marriage to @entity38 , @entity39 , 11 , from her marriage to @entity41 and one - year - old , @entity43 , from her third husband @entity44			1
she spoke out in the march issue of @entity18 , which hit shelves today , saying : ' i would honestly say that i would n’t change a thing			1
even all the bad bits			2
' it does n’t matter how * * * * * times have been , they all matter , because those things shape who you are			1
' and if you do n’t like who you are , well , then you ’re * * * * * * really , are n’t you ? ' appearing on this morning , mum - of - two , @entity29 , slammed the star 's views on divorce and referred to her statements as ' emotional incontinence '			1
‘ she somehow thinks that just because she wants to go off with somebody else it does n’t matter to anybody else – the children can come in my wake and i 'm just going to say it 's fine for them			1
marriage one : the @entity73 actress married director @entity38 in 1998			0
they had a daughter , @entity36 , before divorcing in 2001 ' she ’s got no idea how it ’s going to affect them			0
' but mother - of - one @entity33 , who joined ms @entity29 on the sofa interjected			1
‘ of course she has – she knows a child wants to see their mummy and daddy happy , ' she said			0
' my parents should have got divorced but they never did			0
parents who live together and stay together because of their children are living a lie			0
' they ’re simply saying mummy and daddy are going to stay together for you but we really are n’t happy			0
' simply staying together for sake of children is wrong			0
' but undeterred , ms @entity29 continued : ' plenty of marriages people go through a bad time – especially if do n’t have army of nannies and gardeners			1
' but she says rather than ' stick on a stiff upper lip ' they opt for divorce			1
' many times my husband and i have wanted to strangle each other , ' she admitted			0
marriage two : the actress next walked down the aisle with director @entity41 and had a son , @entity111			0
they split in 2010 marriage three : the star then tied the knot with @entity116 's nephew @entity44 in 2012 and they welcomed a son , @entity43 , the following year ' but children long and long to see their parents together			2
‘ kids have plenty of struggles – kids of happily married couples have struggles			2
there 's no point making extra struggles			2
but ms @entity29 added : ' obviously if there 's violence or bullying – that 's something different			1
' parenting expert @entity135 author of @entity136 , easier , @entity133 said the question of divorce is never black and white			1
‘ on the one hand children want their parents to stay together - unless it is a truly horrendous situation			2
parents who aired their views on parenting forum @entity143 were not all as understanding of @entity0 's views one daughter of divorced parents takes a stance against @entity0 's statements ‘ children want that dream of perfection ' , she told the @entity154			1
‘ but in reality some families benefit from divorce			1
‘ the most troubled dysfunctional families i ’ve seen in my career are the ones where biological parents are staying together for sake of children			0
‘ children will never thank their parents for that			0
’ the star 's interview created a backlash on parenting forum @entity143 some @entity143 users supported @entity0 's view but parents who aired their views on parenting forum @entity143 were not all as understanding			1
' unless it 's an abusive relationship it 's not a positive experience for children			2
how about teaching them to resolve problems etc ? children need to learn life 's not always easy but there are many ways , ' posted @entity186			2
the march issue of @entity18 contains the full interview another mum , @entity0 wrote : ' no i do n't think it is good or helpful to children at all			1
i would n't think that highly of someone who had been married to 3 men had a child each to each husband and been divorced 3 times			0
how is that a good example to her children ? ! ' ' is there a remote chance that this is anything other than self justifying nonsense ? ' wrote @entity204			0
another netmum user @entity205 said : ' i do n't think its fair to judge on different children with different fathers at all , but as someone who experienced my parents divorce when i was young i can say it did n't help at all and i completely disagree			2
but thats just my opinion			0
' but alongside the criticism also came some support			0
one mother @entity111 posted : ' my children have a much better relationship with their father now we are divorced than they ever did when we were married			0
' now he actually has to spend time with them doing things that he just left up to me before			0
i just wish he had been like this when we were together ! ' @entity224 then added : i do n't know that i would go so far as to say that divorce is a good thing for children			2
but in some cases it can be far better than if the parents stay together			0
