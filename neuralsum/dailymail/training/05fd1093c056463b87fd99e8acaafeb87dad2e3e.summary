@entity10 were impressive 4 - 1 winners at @entity12 on wednesday night with @entity13 ( 2 ) , @entity14 and father - to - be @entity15 on target			1
they fell behind to @entity19 ’s 19th - minute effort on the ground where they have been beaten 1 - 0 on their last four visits			2
@entity15 – who married fiancée @entity33 during the summer - celebrated news of her pregnancy with a classy third after the break and @entity13 then stole in for his 19th of the season			1
the striker 's thumping shot was so powerful that it took @entity12 substitute @entity29 by surprise – the @entity43 could be seen flinching before exclaiming : ‘ oh my @entity30 ! ’ it keeps the gap to @entity7 – 3 - 0 winners over @entity47 – at six points			1
and @entity4 said : ‘ we are returning to the form we showed last season , especially after we beat @entity52 ( 3 - 2 last month )			2
@entity13 blasted the ball into the top corner past @entity12 goalkeeper @entity55 @entity14 rifled the second through @entity58 's legs as @entity10 went 2 - 1 ahead ‘ there is trust in the team , it is different now , we are getting our normal performances			1
when the team plays that way , with one touch , moving the ball quickly , we are going to return to being a top team			2
’ he went on : ‘ finally we have won here			2

’ of @entity13 , who won applause from the home crowd when he was substituted late on , he added : ‘ i do n’t know if there is a better striker in @entity77			1
there are a lot of good strikers , but in the last few games i think he has shown he is one of the best five players in the world			0
it ’s not just that he is scoring , he is also playing very well generally			2
’ @entity15 waits for @entity55 to go down before calmly dinking his shot over the keeper for the third @entity15 celebrates scoring @entity10 's third by putting a ball under his shirt - a gesture to his pregnant wife @entity33 @entity7 could only draw 0 - 0 at @entity12 at the weekend but remain odds - on favourites for the title			1
@entity4 , though , insists it is ridiculous to determine the champions before @entity97			0
‘ i ’ve always said it is impossible to know who is going to be champions at this time of year when you still have to play 24 games , ’ he said			0
‘ if we continue playing in this way , i ’m sure we will be in the fight for the title			0
@entity7 are also playing very well , but i do n’t think it will just be two teams fighting for the title			0
