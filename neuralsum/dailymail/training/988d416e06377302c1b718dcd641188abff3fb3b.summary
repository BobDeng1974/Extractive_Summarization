a law student has caused a stir online after publishing a novel design for a drone - proof city			1
@entity4 , designed as a class project by @entity6 , 25 , is an attempt to use architecture to counter surveillance and targeted attacks by the remote - controlled aircraft			1
the provocative design , which is like a sci - fi riff on traditional middle - eastern architecture , uses a range of tricks to confuse the aerial death machines and keep the city 's inhabitants concealed			1
the drone - proof city : law student @entity6 has created a stir online with this , his design for a city that would foil military attempts to operate surveillance and targeted strikes with remote - controlled aircraft drone strikes and surveillance are increasingly part of everyday life in the 21st century			1
barely a week goes by without news of a fresh attack by the machines somewhere in the world			0
according to the @entity38 's @entity37 , a minimum of 2,629 people have so far been killed by drones in @entity42 alone , with many more in other countries like @entity44 and @entity45			1
and it is not only people living in predominantly @entity49 countries who find themselves targeted , as police and spying agencies are increasingly using the aircraft as a covert means of surveillance at home in the @entity57			0
it was recently revealed that the @entity61 military drones with surveillance capabilities so powerful they are able to track the movements of an entire medium - sized city all at once			1
mr @entity6 , who is currently based in the @entity65 , came up with the idea for his drone - proof city for a class on ' @entity69 ' he was taking at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72			1
he told @entity73 : ' i was assigned " military architecture " and realized that for every huge military advance that made it easier to blow up urban areas , there was usually a passive response invented within a generation			2
' so i was wondering what the response would be for drones if drones are the next great advance like artillery and airplanes were			0
' however , despite the widespread , and unexpected , publicity the design has been given , he said he was nervous about calling it a ' full ' design ' ' it 's really just an idea , ' he said			1
' these are n't blueprints , it 's not like this little 10 - page thing is enough for some guy to decide to build his own			1
' it 's really just a conversation starter			2
i did n't take even take the class for a grade			0
' attack of the drones : tribesmen gather at the site of a drone strike in @entity109 , a village 12 miles east of @entity111 , near the @entity113 - @entity42 border , which killed six people in the paper , mr @entity6 writes : ' architecture against drones is not just a science - fiction scenario but a contemporary imperative			1
' such creations are not needed for the @entity121 but for the @entity122			0
' the successful check against the machines is not a daydream but an inevitability , and the quicker more creative solutions are proposed , the more likely such answers can be disseminated widely and kept from the patent - wielding hands of some offshore - utopian type			2
' @entity4 , provocatively named for the groups of elders who take decisions in the @entity49 communities which are the principal targets of drone strikes , is a product of mr @entity6 's fascination for ' drones ' existence in a post-legal world '			1
ringed by minarets and built from concrete , which drone sensors can not penetrate , its layout would be specifically designed to confuse from the outside - foiling the airborne watchers ' ability to dish out targeted death from above			2
' the goal is not defense - through - hardening , but defense - through - confusion , ' writes mr @entity6			1
' by turning the entire community into a closed circuit , drones targeting individuals will not be able to select and detect the individuals they desire once they enter the city			0
' windows of the city would be made from multi-coloured blocks of glass , to further foil drones ' attempts to get a fix on to their targets			0
' the changing colours make it more difficult for electronic cameras to peer in and make out one person from the next without hints of skin tone or clothing colour , ' says mr @entity6			1
a @entity61 @entity175 mq - 9 reaper drone : according to the @entity38 's @entity37 , a minimum of 2,629 people have so far been killed by drones in @entity42 alone , with more elsewhere a sinister airborne surveillance camera gives the @entity61 military the ability to track movements in an entire city like a real - time @entity184			1
the @entity186 array can be mounted on unmanned drones to capture an area of 15 sq / miles in an incredible @entity189 - that 's 225 times more sensitive than an @entity191 camera			1
from 17,500ft the remarkable surveillance system can capture objects as small as 6in on the ground and allows commanders to track movements across an entire battlefield in real time			0
' it is important for the public to know that some of these capabilities exist , ' said @entity203 , the @entity204 engineer who designed the system , in a recent @entity207 broadcast			0
the aerospace and weapons company developed the @entity186 array as part of a $ 18.5million project funded by the @entity213 's @entity212 ( @entity212 )			1
in @entity221 mythology , @entity214 , guardian of the heifer - nymph @entity216 and son of @entity219 , was a primordial giant whose epithet , ' @entity214 ' , ' all - seeing ' , led to his being described with multiple , often one hundred , eyes			2
like the @entity228 of myth , the @entity213 's @entity186 ( a backronym standing for @entity227 @entity226 ) works by stringing together an array of 368 digital camera imaging chips			2
an airborne processor combines the video from these chips to create a single ultra-high definition mosaic video image which updates at up to 15 frames a second			0
dr @entity238 , director of optical sensor systems at @entity204 , said : ' @entity241 - is system overcomes the fundamental limitations of current airborne surveillance systems			2
' very high - resolution imaging systems required for vehicle and dismount tracking typically have a " soda - straw " view that is too small for persistent coverage			2
' existing wide - area systems have either inadequate resolution or require multiple passes or revisits to get updates			2
' a further addition to the fenestration could be the addition of high - tech equivalents to traditional @entity257 - the delicate carved lattice - work which are often seen on windows in @entity260 cities			1
in @entity262 the mashrabiya would be movable and able to form new patterns - even @entity263 which would make any interloping drones spontaneously self - destruct			2
' today , the codes are often shoehorned unattractively into advertisements made for human eyes			0
this is ugly , stupid , and ineffective , ' writes mr @entity6			1
' tomorrow , a drone trying to peer through a window could get guillotined by a mashrabiya contorting itself into a self - destruct code			2
now that ’s more like it ' at the head of @entity4 would be a roof , as a physical barrier to prevent drones coming too close , but criss - crossed with lines to break up the profile of the buildings below			0
making the city a closed environment would also allow it to be climate controlled , in such a way that heat - seeking cameras would be ineffective at picking out the inhabitants outside			0
mr @entity6 first submitted the concept for @entity4 in spring last year , but his design has been widely reported on the web in recent days			1
he has predictably come in for some criticism , moral but also practical , like @entity297 contributor @entity295 's claim that mr @entity6 is trying to fight a ' lost battle '			1
' it is much easier and quicker to improve drone aircraft , software and sensors than it is to change a building or a city to fool them , ' writes mr @entity295			0
' the 1990s @entity307 was the size of a small passenger jet			0
now drones are the size of insects			0
' if we ca n’t keep mosquitoes out of our homes , a mosquito - sized drone wo n’t be any easier to swat			0
' he adds : ' however , the truth is that while police drones overhead are bad , living in a jail is worse			0
it is not a good trade if the price of privacy is quality of life			0
' twisting streets to confuse drones ? wait until the pizza delivery guy or your grandmother ca n’t find your house			0
' but mr @entity6 makes no claim to have created the be all and end all of drone - proof cities , but says he merely wants to provoke discussion of the implications drones have for how future societies might be structured			1
' what this project proposes is a new way to think about space , ' mr @entity6 writes			1
' drone warfare proposes that every inch of land is ( and all of its inhabitants are ) part of the battle space			0
' he concludes : ' @entity4 is about using architecture to create aspace for humanity in an increasingly inhuman sphere			0
' mr @entity6 added to @entity73 : ' a few people have told me that hiding from drones is illegal , which i find hilarious , because , wait , we 're expecting people to just be totally on - board with fiery death coming down from the sky without a moment 's notice ? ' i 'm just using the vocabulary of architecture to point out the shortcomings of drone warfare			1
my whole point was that law has nothing to do with it			0
' an architectural defense from drones by @entity375			0

@entity6 came up with the concept for a design *school* project
provocative design is like a sci - fi riff on traditional @entity257 architecture
mr @entity6 says ' it 's just an idea ' , despite widespread unexpected attention
