@entity2 cabinet ministers are split over whether the party should pledge to limit child benefit to the first two children , it emerged last night			1
work and pensions secretary @entity6 gave his public backing to the idea yesterday , saying it would encourage ‘ responsibility ’ by parents			0
mr @entity6 , a long - time enthusiast for the plan , has drawn up private costings suggesting the move could cut £ 2 billion a year off the benefits bill if it is applied to all future families			1
but other ministers are nervous that the move could alienate working families on low incomes – and draw unflattering comparisons with @entity34 ’s controversial ‘ one child policy ’			1
a @entity2 source said the chancellor @entity36 is among those who are ‘ worried about the politics ’ of the plan			0
mr @entity6 yesterday suggested the policy could be limited to families on benefits – reducing the potential controversy , but also slashing the amount it would save			1
he told the @entity48 ’s @entity47 show : ‘ this is not a policy of the present government - if we do go down that road we will announce that			0
pledge : mr @entity6 told the @entity48 ’s @entity47 show ' this is not about trying to penalise people ' ' all i would say is this - people out there who are working , they make decisions about the size of their house , about how many children they have in accordance with what they can afford , we all do that , that ’s how we work			1
‘ we have n’t made any announcement			0
all i ’m saying to you is the principle that lies behind all these changes is this - you want people who are on benefit to take as much responsibility for their lives as people who are in work , that way it ’s easier for them when they go to work to deal with their bills and their debts , etc. this is not about trying to penalise people			0
’ large existing families would not be penalised by the @entity2 proposals , as they would only apply to children born in the future			2
the cap would mean that a family having more than two children would lose almost £ 700 per child per year			2
against idea : @entity2 ministers originally considered capping child benefit at two children in 2012			1
but the plan was vetoed by @entity100 those pushed over the limit by multiple births would be exempt			0
the plan would also not affect those earning more than £ 50,000 a year , who have already had their child benefit cut			1
@entity107 declined to comment on the issue last night , saying it was ‘ not policy at the moment ’			0
senior @entity111 are still debating whether new curbs on child benefit should be included in the manifesto – and whether they should apply only to those on benefits			1
@entity2 ministers originally considered capping child benefit at two children in 2012			1
but the plan was vetoed by @entity100			0
@entity118 , a member of the @entity120 policy board , was slapped down by mr @entity121 the following year for reviving the plan and suggesting it should be applied to all families , including those not on benefits			2
but the need to find £ 12billion savings from the benefits bill has led to a reappraisal of the scheme			2
one @entity2 enthusiast for the idea , said : ‘ this is an idea that saves a lot of money – something like £ 2billion a year			1
' and it ’s a good one because it ’s not about squeezing or freezing existing benefits			0
instead , it ’s a principle - based policy that just says we should all face the same choices about how many children we can afford to support			2
‘ people ca n’t expect the taxpayer to fund lifestyle choices they ca n’t afford			0
’ the idea of capping child benefit payments has been condemned by anti-poverty charities			2
@entity150 @entity149 has warned it would have a ‘ devastating effect on those already struggling to make ends meet ’ .			0
