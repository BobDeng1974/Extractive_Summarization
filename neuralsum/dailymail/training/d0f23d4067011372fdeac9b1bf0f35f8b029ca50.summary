by @entity0 published : 16:28 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 16:33 est , 13 july 2013 fighting back : @entity1 is considering taking legal action a high - flying businesswoman may sue cosmetics firm @entity4 after red sores broke out all over her face when she used its expensive beauty products			1
@entity1 , 52 , discovered she had an allergy to methylisothiazolinone ( @entity9 ) , a preservative in the @entity4 creams			1
she is among the latest victims of what dermatologists say is an epidemic of allergies caused by the compound			1
last week @entity18 revealed experts are calling for an immediate ban on @entity21 at @entity22 in @entity23 blame the compound for a massive surge in patients with skin problems			2
@entity1 ’s skin began breaking out in welts after regularly using @entity4 products , such as the @entity31 and @entity32			1
the dating agency boss from @entity34 had been using @entity4 products for cleansing and moisturising for two decades			1
she said : ‘ i ’ve always had really healthy skin so i was terrified by the sores and made an appointment to see my gp			1
i assumed it was stress			2
’ the doctor prescribed hydrocortisone cream but it made no difference			0
two months later the welts were so painful she could n’t cover them with make - up			1
finally @entity1 saw dr @entity52 , a consultant dermatologist at @entity53 and @entity54 in @entity34			0
tests found @entity1 had a severe allergic reaction to @entity9 and to @entity4 ’ @entity31			1
' terrifying ' : @entity1 was covered in red sores after using the luxury skincare @entity1 ’s allergic reaction came as no surprise to dr @entity52			2
she said : ‘ i ’ve seen more and more cases like these in the past two years			0
the general feeling is that it ’s due to @entity9 being used more widely and at higher concentrations			0
’ @entity1 now avoids @entity9 and her condition is under control , but she struggles to find mi - free products			2
she says : ‘ i have to be incredibly careful			0
expensive : @entity1 says this @entity71 product caused her welts ‘ it ’s hard because the same preservative is called by many different names			1
it ’s in so many things it ’s difficult to avoid – i ’ve only found two shampoos without it and ca n’t find a suntan lotion so have to stay out of the sun. ’ the preservative was first approved for use in skincare in 2005			2
two studies presented at the @entity87 of @entity88 ’ conference last week showed a sharp rise in reactions to @entity9 over the past three years			0
consultant dermatologist dr @entity92 said : ‘ this is one of the worst outbreaks i have ever seen			0
there has n’t been anything on this scale before			0
we just do n’t know when it will peak			0
’ manufacturers have ignored calls for immediate action , but legal experts warn they could become liable for compensation claims			0
the @entity105 – the trade association representing @entity107 manufacturers – this week met dermatologists to ‘ plan further meetings to discuss the most appropriate step to undertake ’			2
but @entity4 dismissed concerns , claiming that cases of @entity9 allergy are isolated			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it is inevitable that someone , somewhere will be unable to tolerate a particular ingredient or combination of ingredients within a product formula			0
’ the company insists its ingredients are approved by the @entity123 and its safety is reviewed by the @entity125 on @entity126			0
@entity4 would not , however , confirm whether it had recently changed its formulations to include @entity9 .			1
