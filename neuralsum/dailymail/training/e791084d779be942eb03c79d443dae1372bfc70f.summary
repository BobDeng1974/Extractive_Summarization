the @entity0 wants its money back after it says it overpaid $ 5.8million to thousands of people who received emergency disaster aid for their losses from @entity5 , the hurricane that struck the @entity7 almost two years ago			1
@entity0 is scrutinizing about 4,500 households that it suspects received improper payments after the storm , which resulted in total federal disaster payments of $ 1.4 billion , according to program officials and data obtained by @entity14 through a public records request			1
so far , about 850 of those aid recipients have been asked to pay back a total of $ 5.8 million			1
other cases remain under review			0
after receiving nearly $ 17,000 in assistance from @entity0 , the agency is demanding he return the funds @entity29 , @entity21 's father , sits in his car outside his home			1
@entity0 sent @entity21 a letter in november demanding back the money he received partly because his father also applied for disaster funds even though they were both living together			1
that 's a violation of agency double - dipping rules the average refund demanded by @entity0 tallied just $ 6,987 as of july 30 , but that might be too much for many of the households			1
about half of the 4,500 reported an annual gross income of $ 30,000 or less			0
the campaign to recover overpayments , called ' recoupment ' in agency lingo , typically involves inadvertent violations of eligibility rules , bureaucratic mistakes or missing documentation , rather than outright fraud			0
many people asked to return money were deemed ineligible because their damaged properties were vacation houses or rental properties , not their primary residences			1
others had double dipped into the aid pool , with more than one household member getting payments			1
some received @entity0 money for things later covered by insurance			1
@entity21 holds a copy of a letter that identifies himself as a tenant of his parent 's home			0
he argues he should still qualify for the money because he was a rent - paying tenant , not a dependant the larger pool of cases still under review as of that date involved $ 53 million in aid payments -- or about 3.7 per cent of the total given out by @entity0 through its individuals and households program -- though any potential refunds would likely involve only a portion of that money			1
' for most people , the money is long gone and long ago spent on storm recovery , ' said @entity90 , director of the @entity92 's storm response unit , which has been helping about a dozen families fight a @entity0 clawback			1
twenty five cases under review involved households reporting a gross annual income of $ 500,000 or more			2
the list of people asked to return cash includes @entity21 of @entity24 , @entity25 , who got a letter last november demanding just under $ 17,000			1
the agency said he was ineligible partly because he and his elderly father , @entity105 , had both applied for disaster funds even though they were living together			1
that 's a violation of @entity0 double - dipping rules			1
the @entity109 also were barred from getting some types of aid because they had failed to buy flood insurance after getting $ 25,000 in @entity0 aid for flood damage during @entity115 a year earlier			1
federal rules require homeowners who accept disaster aid to buy insurance to protect them from future storms			2
a home in @entity122 shows the severe damage it sustained after @entity5 passed on october 29 , 2012 in @entity124 , @entity125 @entity21 says he should still qualify for the money because he was a rent - paying tenant in his father 's house , not a dependent , but @entity0 has so far rejected his appeals			1
' i lost my home			0
i do n't have $ 17,000 to give back , ' @entity21 said			0
@entity5 was among the costliest hurricanes in @entity136 history			0
more than 280 people died in the @entity136 and the @entity138			0
when the storm struck the @entity25 and @entity142 coastlines , the surging ocean poured into densely populated seaside neighborhoods , flooding hospitals and subway tunnels and turning entire communities into soggy , moldy wrecks			0
about 179,000 households in @entity25 and @entity142 received @entity0 payments for temporary housing or damaged property			1
most of the recoupment actions have also been aimed at residents of those states , but the agency is also reviewing payments to households in @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
@entity0 mobilized for @entity5 hoping to avoid problems that plagued the aid distribution process following @entity165 's strike on the @entity166 in 2005			2
that destructive storm forced the overwhelmed agency to relax internal controls to speed up relief efforts , which led to huge numbers of people getting money they should n't have received			1
@entity0 's attempts to recover hundreds of millions of dollars , often from people who could n't afford to pay , led to a court fight and a procedural overhaul			2
by 2011 , the agency had mailed out letters to at least 90,000 households asking for aid refunds			2
@entity182 authorized the agency to waive much of that debt			0
the agency says it has since gotten better at making sure aid only goes to the right people , and in proper amounts			2
a television anchor reports from the stormy streets of @entity189 , @entity142 , in october 2012 as @entity5 hit the @entity190 ' they have a lot more controls in place , ' said @entity195 , the @entity197 's assistant inspector general for emergency management oversight			0
in most cases , aid recipients wo n't know they 're under scrutiny before a notice arrives in the mail demanding repayment			1
@entity0 says it has reviewed thousands of cases and decided the payments were warranted			2
@entity0 is n't the only government agency trying to recover @entity5 - related funding			2
last spring , the @entity136 @entity209 urged officials in @entity142 and @entity25 to step up their scrutiny of hundreds of millions of dollars in other federal rebuilding grants			0
@entity142 's @entity213 says it has asked 51 homeowners to return a combined $ 940,000 -- a number that will probably will rise as the state looks at more cases			2
@entity218 got a letter from the state in july giving him five days to return a $ 26,101 grant he 'd received to repair his flooded house in @entity223 , @entity142			2
the letter explained that auditors had pegged the cost of fixing the house and raising it up on a higher foundation at less than the family had already received from their insurance policies and a low - interest federal disaster loan			2
that meant that the state grant was pure surplus and had to be returned			0
@entity0 said the @entity109 were also barred from getting some types of aid because they had failed to buy flood insurance after getting $ 25,000 in @entity0 aid for flood damage during @entity115 a year earlier			1
federal rules require homeowners who accept disaster aid to buy insurance to protect them from future storms ' i was stunned , ' @entity218 said of his reaction when he got the notice , which he said came with no warning and no mention of any possibility of appeal			0
@entity25 officials were unable to say how much money they had recouped so far from grant recipients who had been overpaid or belatedly declared ineligible			1
during one audit earlier this year , @entity209 officials warned that @entity25 was n't doing enough to ensure that rebuilding grants were n't ' unduly enriching homeowners beyond their actual expenses			0
' it cited several examples in which checks had been sent improperly			0
one homeowner returned a check for $ 119,138 after realizing that it included payment for damage covered by insurance			2
a month later , she got another letter saying she had been approved for an even larger overpayment of $ 121,731			0
@entity273 spokeswoman @entity272 said @entity274 has since improved its record - keeping procedures			0
federal prosecutors have , so far , brought far fewer fraud cases against aid recipients than they did after @entity165 , though it is unclear whether that is because less theft has occurred or because investigators have n't been as aggressive			1
by @entity165 's second anniversary , more than 768 people had been charged with hurricane fraud - related crimes in 41 federal jurisdictions			0
by comparison , only seven people so far have faced federal fraud charges related to disaster aid payments in the states where @entity0 distributed aid after @entity5 , according to an @entity14 survey of prosecutors ' offices			1
@entity195 , the assistant inspector general , said the modest tally of @entity5 - related fraud cases likely reflects a shift in law - enforcement priorities			0
the @entity302 enforced a ' zero tolerance ' policy for @entity165 fraud , he said			0
but he believes it has since given prosecutors more freedom to turn down cases involving relatively small sums of money			0
@entity302 spokesman @entity312 declined to comment on the number of @entity5 - related prosecutions , but he noted that a federal task force on disaster fraud has received more than 30,000 complaints from the public about possible @entity165 - related fraud compared to 1,758 complaints related to @entity5			0
this photo shows the storm surge from @entity5 that left half of @entity324 , @entity142 , flooded with sewage - laden water and some 20,000 residents trapped in apartments with no power			0

about 850 aid recipients so far have been asked to return an average of $ 7,000 a piece the agency says it overpaid
people deemed ineligible may have used funds for vacation or rental properties , double dipped in the aid pool or received money for things later covered by insurance
@entity0 continues to scrutinize more than *3,500* other households for improper payments
