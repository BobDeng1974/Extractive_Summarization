@entity4 ’s says that ‘ manners , social intelligence , personal presentation and impact can be as important as academic qualifications			1
‘ with so much focus on exam results and the hectic informality of modern family life and technology , social graces can be a casualty			2
’ the courses come amid accusations that schools and universities are so focused on academic targets that they are failing to produce rounded graduates			1
instead they are turning out young people who are shy and awkward after spending all their time on the internet or mobiles , who lack the ability to spell or write a letter , and are unable to get through a day without regular online checks on what their friends are up to			2
@entity61 , @entity4 ’s director of training , said : ‘ @entity63 employees need to differentiate themselves beyond their academic achievements			1
employers listed dependency on the internet and text jargon as some of the reasons why young people are so ill equipped in the workplace the research clearly shows that this is often lacking			1

misplaced informality was another complaint			0
some 21per cent of employers said young employees had dressed inappropriately for the workplace or had drunk too much at work social events			1
@entity94 , managing director of @entity95 , said : ‘ there is so much emphasis on passing written exams that there ’s no room for them to be taught life skills			2
‘ throw in text jargon and overuse of the internet to communicate and you ’ve got a generation which can not connect one to one			2
being a nice person to do business with is crucial no matter what business you are in			0
’ she said she would prefer a job applicant to have good social skills rather than perfect academic grades			1
‘ we have just had a chap in			0
on paper he looked fabulous - he had brilliant qualifications			2
on the second day he had to write a letter - he could n’t do it			0
‘ it ’s the whole ethos of this generation - they miss a trick with their attitude of expectation			2
‘ we all expected to do rough jobs during the summer holidays or whatever , pick fruit , knock on doors selling things , working in a factory			0
those jobs taught life skills			2
‘ every teenager should have to do some sort of summer job			0
it would teach them not to rely on the bank of mum and dad and help their development as well			0
’ the publishing house considers itself an expert on ' knowing the who 's who and what 's what of today 's @entity2 ' almost three quarters of the 58 business leaders in the survey did agree that a preoccupation with technology hurts the social skills of young employees , affecting their ability to build relationships with clients			1
even firms whose business is in the digital world are concerned			0
@entity164 , managing director at @entity165 , a digital advertising agency , said : ‘ we want candidates who live and breathe the digital world but too many are over-reliant on technology			0
‘ they are shy and scared			0
