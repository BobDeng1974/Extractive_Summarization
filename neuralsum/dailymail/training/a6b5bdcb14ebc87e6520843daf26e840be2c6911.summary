by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the scout movement is to preserve the historic promise by its members that they will do their duty to @entity8 , its leaders said yesterday			1
they bowed to pressure from secular lobbyists and offered boys and girls from atheist families the chance to make a special non-religious pledge when they sign up as @entity16			1
but new recruits will continue to make the religious promise unless they ask for the atheist version			1
it was welcomed by church leaders , who praised the @entity16 for ‘ affirming the importance of spiritual life			0
’ the @entity16 choice to keep @entity8 in its main membership pledge follows months of argument over whether the country ’s two biggest youth movements should continue to honour religion as one of their central principles			1
guide leaders said in june that their organisation ’s longstanding demand that girls who sign up should promise to ‘ love my @entity8 ’ was ‘ confusing ’ about belief and ‘ discouraged some girls and volunteers from joining us			1
’ instead new guides now pledge ‘ to be true to myself ’ and ‘ to serve my community ’			0
but @entity16 officials said yesterday that following a 10 - month consultation ‘ the core scout promise remains in place and scouting remains fully committed as a movement that explores faith and religion as a core element of its programme			1
’ oath : @entity66 of @entity67 accepts flowers from a local scout in 2011			1
the reference to the @entity71 in the promise will be retained as well			0
the decision opens up a new element of competition for recruits between the two organisations			0
although the @entity26 remain an all - female group , scouts have accepted girls as members since the 1970s and now have more than 77,000 girls among 537,000 members			1
the @entity84 , which dates from the foundation of the movement in 1907 , requires that new members declare : ‘ on my honour , i promise that i will do my best , to do my duty to @entity8 and to the @entity71 , to help other people and to keep the @entity92			1
’ different versions for the use of @entity95 , hindus and @entity97 have been available since 1960 , although all have included a religious reference			2
there are also versions for foreign members which allow them to pledge duty ‘ to the country in which i am now living ’ rather than to the @entity71			2
the new wording for atheists says : ‘ on my honour i promise that i will do my best to uphold our scout values , to do my duty to the @entity71 , to help other people and to keep the @entity92			2
’ scout chief commissioner @entity111 said yesterday : ‘ throughout its 106 - year history the movement has continued to evolve and today marks an important step in that journey			2
' it also signifies the determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society that it serves			0
‘ we are a values - based movement and exploring faith and beliefs remains a key element of the @entity126			2
’ churchmen from the main denominations welcomed the move			0
the right reverend @entity131 , @entity132 @entity133 , said : ‘ as the recent national census demonstrated , we remain a faithful nation where the majority of families find identity and meaning in religious belief			0
opposition : @entity141 of the @entity142 said he preferred the guide 's approach ` ‘ in enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs @entity126 has demonstrated that it is both possible , and i would argue preferable , to affirm the importance of spiritual life and not to restrict meaning to arbitrary self - definition			0
’ @entity141 of the @entity142 welcomed the decision but said : ‘ we think the @entity26 ’ response to this issue was infinitely superior			0
they introduced a secular oath for everyone			1
' this approach relieves young people of having to make a decision about what they believe at a time in their lives when maybe they have n’t decided			0

it was decided to retain the historic oath after a ten - month consultation
scouts swear ' to do my duty to @entity8 ' , as well as the queen
but a new atheist version with no religious *connotations* will be introduced
