savers will go back to storing cash under the mattress if the taxman wins the power to seize money from bank accounts , experts warned last night			1
they said @entity9 ’s record of blunders meant it could not be trusted as ‘ judge , jury and executioner ’ over people ’s money			1
officials want to be able to take funds directly from the current accounts , joint accounts or @entity20 of those owing it money			1
the @entity37 said @entity9 would inevitably make errors that could have damaging consequences			1
@entity40 , the @entity41 and human rights group @entity42 have written jointly to the chancellor urging him to abandon the plans			1
around 17,000 people a year would have money seized under the debt recovery powers , all without the need for @entity9 to go to court			1
official documents reveal it expects to receive £ 375million from the scheme between 2015 and 2019			0
it says it will ensure its targets always have at least £ 5,000 left over after any raid on their accounts			2
but it is feared worried savers might opt to keep their cash at home , exposing themselves to theft			0
they would miss out on interest on their money and , in extreme cases , simply forget where they left it			0
previous articles : the @entity71 from may 9 , pictured left , and @entity72 from may 17 , pictured right it is also likely that tax dodgers – who are the real target for @entity9 – might move their money offshore			1
in its response to a consultation on the scheme , the @entity37 said the rules would be side - stepped by the unscrupulous and any mistakes would erode public trust			0
it warned : ‘ those who intend to avoid paying tax can – once they know that direct recovery of debts is an option – easily side - step it by taking their funds out of their @entity92 bank accounts			1
‘ @entity9 does not explain how it would counteract this simple and obvious strategy			2
but experts say @entity9 , pictured above , can not be ' judge , jury and executioner ’ over people ’s money ‘ introducing the direct recovery of debts could in fact encourage such people to move their funds offshore			1
‘ the publicity given to any case where the direct recovery of debts is used inappropriately would have a damaging effect on public confidence in the tax system			2
‘ in the @entity92 , voluntary compliance and trust in the tax system are crucial to the way the system operates			0
‘ the cost of trust being eroded will far outweigh the sums the direct recovery of debts is expected to yield			2
’ an online petition on the government ’s website calling for the proposals to be withdrawn has attracted more than 1,800 signatures			0
@entity124 of the @entity125 said it was a ‘ dangerously bad idea ’			0
‘ @entity9 has been known to make mistakes , ’ he added			1
pressure groups have urged @entity129 to abandon plans which allow @entity9 to take funds straight from the accounts of those owing money ‘ the people who are most likely to be hit by this are vulnerable people who are not able to deal with @entity9 so well			1
other people who are not so vulnerable will just make sure that they do not have enough money in bank accounts that @entity9 can get their hands on			1
‘ we honestly do think it is a bad idea			0
we are not accusing them of making mistakes all the time – but this is just dangerous			0
’ in may , @entity145 , the exchequer secretary to the treasury , said he recognised there were ‘ concerns about the impact of this change on vulnerable members of society ’			0
but he added : ‘ we must ensure that there are strong safeguards in place so that this is only targeted at the truly non-compliant			0
’ anybody who has money removed from their account will have been contacted a minimum of four times before it is seized			2
an @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ a very small number of the country ’s many millions of taxpayers refuse to pay what they owe despite being well able to			2
‘ this is simply unfair to the vast majority			0
‘ @entity172 proposals contain numerous safeguards – the average debt is £ 5,800 and most of the 17,000 taxpayers potentially affected have around £ 20,000 in cash available to them			2
‘ @entity179 will level the playing field firmly but fairly			0

@entity9 would take funds direct from accounts or @entity20 of those owing money
but this could lead to customers cashing out their savings , experts warn
officials would likely make mistakes with damaging consequences , they say
17,000 would have money seized per year under new debt recovery powers
pressure groups have written to chancellor urging him to abandon plans
