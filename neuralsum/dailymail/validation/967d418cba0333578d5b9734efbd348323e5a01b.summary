@entity0 , pictured with mother @entity1 , munches through an incredible 30 pots of @entity3 per day a fussy four - year - old girl refuses to eat anything other than @entity3 - munching her way through 30 pots a day			1
@entity0 refuses to eat any solid food and becomes hysterical every time mother @entity9 , 32 , offers her anything other than raspberry and strawberry flavour yoghurt			1
the youngster wo n't touch chocolate , sweets or ice cream and even bursts into tears if she is offered an alternative brand			1
each 47g pot of @entity21 contains around a teaspoon of sugar , meaning @entity0 is consuming 30 teaspoons a day - more than twice the recommended adult intake			1
but doctors who have examined the youngster say her unusual diet - which costs more than £ 2,000 a year - is not affecting her health or development			1
however , full - time mother @entity9 is worried about the long - term implications and is desperately trying to find somebody to give her some answers			1
the mother - of - three , from @entity34 , @entity35 said : ' she has seen pediatricians and dietitians but nobody has been able to help her and i do n't know what to do			1
' she will play with other food and touch it with her hands but she becomes hysterical if you try and feed her it			1
' it is just totally bizarre			0
i breast fed her and then gave her formula and then she had yogurt but she would never take that next step			0
' as she was growing up my family kept saying she would grow out of it but she has started pre-school and i am really worried			0
' i have tried to get her to eat in a telling way , i 've tried in a nice way , i 've tried using encouragement , i 've tried using other children , but nothing works			2
' she just gets hysterical if you put something on a spoon and give it to her			0
i ca n't force feed her and i 'm starting to think she will never grow out of it			2
' it really has started to worry me			0
she is going to be starting school in september and she needs a variation in her diet			2
she refuses to eat any solid food and becomes hysterical every time mother @entity9 , 32 , offers her anything other than yogurt doctors who have examined the youngster say her unusual diet - which costs more than £ 2,000 a year - is not affecting her health or development ' we thought the pediatrician would be able to help but she has n't had a case like it before			1
' her advice has been to just let it follow its natural course and she will grow out of it but i 'm not convinced that she will			0
' @entity9 has to make daily visits to her local supermarket to cope with @entity0 's diet - which tops 11,000 pots a year			1
she will eat six pots for breakfast and then snack on another two dozen pots throughout the rest of the day			2
@entity9 said her daughter even turns her nose up if she tries to disguise one by putting it in an empty @entity21 pot. siblings @entity101 , two , and nine - month - old @entity102 eat normally			1
despite her diet @entity9 says doctors at @entity105 have told her the youngster is just as healthy as any other child her age			1
@entity9 added : ' she is a very happy child and totally normal in every way apart from this			2
a mountain of yoghurt : @entity0 ( pictured with uncle @entity112 ) will eat six pots for breakfast and then snack on another two dozen pots throughout the rest of the day ' it has n't affected her health in any way			1
we have had blood tests done but she is not anaemic or anything and it is all normal			0
' i have not heard anything like it and i want to find somebody similar or find a specialist who can offer some help			0
' a recent report by the @entity132 recommended that adults should eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day			2
@entity136 spokeswoman @entity135 said @entity0 could be at risk of becoming ' dangerously anaemic '			2
she said : ' we do come across children who miss that really important weaning window but this is a very unusual case			0
' she will probably get enough protein and energy from the diet and she will certainly get enough calcium			0
the issue would be for minerals and vitamin deficiencies			0
' there is no iron in that diet whatsoever and we find children who rely exclusively on milk become dangerously anaemic			0
' this seems more extreme than the girl just being fussy and often we find the most extreme eaters tend to be on the autistic spectrum			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity105 said it does not comment on individual cases .			0

@entity0 , 4 , refuses solid food and wo n't even touch sweets
all she will eat is strawberry or raspberry flavour @entity21 pots
her unusual diet costs her *exasperated* mother @entity9 £ 2,000 a year
but doctors say her diet is not affecting her health or development
