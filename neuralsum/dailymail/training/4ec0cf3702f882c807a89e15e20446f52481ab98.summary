not ready : close pals say @entity1 , seen here attending a society wedding has no plans of becoming a royal bride within the next 12 months their romance may be going from strength to strength – but if prince @entity9 thinks that his glamorous young girlfriend @entity1 is ready for marriage he can think again			1
@entity1 , 25 , has told friends she has no plans of becoming a royal bride within the next 12 months and would prefer smitten @entity9 to wait before asking for her hand in marriage			1
the couple have been dating for two years , but observers have noted that their relationship has become far more serious in recent weeks			1
however , a close friend of the couple said the former dance student ‘ has yet to make up her mind about what she wants to do ’			1
‘ @entity27 is very busy and has lots to do			1
marriage is not something she ’s considering yet , ’ said the source			2
‘ she has just started a new job where she ’s being paid the usual salary for someone of her age – i.e. peanuts – and she has found a flat to rent with her friend @entity37			0
she is doing all the things that people in their 20s should be doing			0
‘ who knows what might have changed by this time next year but that is how she wants it to be			0
‘ she does n’t want to miss out on that chapter – she ’s not that kind of girl			0
that said , her mother is ecstatic and would love them to get engaged			0
’ although @entity9 , 29 , has made it clear to his girlfriend that he is besotted – and that he would love to pop the question – @entity27 ’s determination not to rush things also stems from the fact that few of her closest friends have settled down			1
the source said : ‘ when @entity27 ’s good chum @entity66 got engaged to one of @entity9 ’s best friends , @entity64 , she was really happy for them because they had been together for several years			1
however , she noted that @entity66 was only 25 at the time and she thinks that ’s really young			0
’ instead , free - spirited @entity27 , who recently started a new job in marketing , is busy planning her adventures for the year ahead			1
in addition to hiring a tipi with friends for the @entity78 in june , she is planning a trip to sir @entity81 ’s @entity80 in the @entity82 this summer			0
she will be travelling with her half - sister @entity83 , who is married to sir @entity81 ’s son @entity84			0
close : @entity9 is said to be keen to pop the question to @entity27 , the pair looked happy pictured here at an event in @entity89 last month busy : free - spirited @entity27 is said to be busy planning her adventures for the year ahead @entity27 also wants to attend the burning man festival , a cultural event that takes place in the @entity96 desert at the end of august			1
the friend said : ‘ @entity27 has always wanted to go to @entity99 and she ’s been talking about joining a huge gang who are going this year			2
it ’s unlikely @entity9 will be able to go , though			2
impatient : @entity9 has made it clear to his girlfriend that he is besotted with her ' it is such an effort – you have to book flights to @entity110 and then hire an rv and fill it with food because no money is exchanged on the festival site			1
it takes lots of planning and months of saving			0
‘ those are the kind of big events on @entity123 ’s horizon at the moment , not weddings			0
’ meanwhile , @entity9 is planning two overseas @entity127 tours this year			2
he is due to visit @entity128 and @entity129 in may , followed by a visit to @entity131 and @entity132 in june			0

on tuesday @entity9 went on a ‘ boys ’ night ’ to a smart private club in @entity144 with his friends @entity146 , the @entity141 rugby star , stockbroker @entity148 , and @entity150			1
the group was overheard teasing @entity9 about reports that he will soon be walking down the aisle			2
a source told @entity138 : ‘ they were joshing him about planning his stag do			0
@entity9 said , “ i have to be careful , it ca n’t be like vegas ” ’ – thought to be a reference to his infamous trip to the city in 2012 when he was photographed frolicking naked at a hotel			2
