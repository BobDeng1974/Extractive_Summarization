in the @entity2 capital of @entity3 , there exists a commodity that is worth more than gold - virginity			1
wealthy men will pay thousands to have sex with an innocent girl and , as a result , ' virgin trafficking ' has become big business			1
but not every girl is trafficked			1
many others sell their virginity because they are desperate for money - and then often fall into a life of prostitution			1
now the shocking story of @entity2 's virgin prostitutes is to feature in a new @entity42 documentary which meets some of the victims			1
although her own career was built on selling sex as a glamour model , the 35 - year - old says she is grateful she never had to do more than sell pictures of her body			1
' girls like @entity22 are forced to sell themselves for money time and time again , ' she said			0
' i have the choice to abstain from sex and i have realised what a huge privilege that is			1
' 23 - year - old @entity22 lives in @entity2 capital @entity3 and now works as a prostitute after being forced to sell her virginity to pay for an operation that saved her ailing father 's life			1
shocking statistics : @entity42 travelled to @entity65 where she learnt there are 50 - 70,000 sex workers 40 percent of them are under age ' i received the news that my father was ill back home , ' she reveals			1
' i had nowhere to go so i decided to sell my virginity			1
it was three years ago when i was 20 and i was paid $ 3,000 ( Â£ 1,877 ) by a @entity76 man			0
' i was taken to a restaurant first and then a hotel			0
i was told to undress and take a shower			0
afterwards i was told to keep my clothes off so i was covered only by a towel			0
' i was shivering and did n't know what to do because i had already agreed to have sex			1
' tragically , as a result of what happened , @entity22 says she is no longer close to her family - even though she did it for them			0
' i 'm in pain because my family keeps their distance			0
it hurts me but i understand because they did n't ask me to sell my virginity , they did n't want me to do that			2
' while @entity22 's father , who also appears in the documentary , says he is grateful that his daughter 's sacrifice saved his life , he wishes there had been another way			2
he said after learning his daughter had sold her virginity , he felt ' anger , sadness and sorry as a parent but there was nothing i could do because it had already happened '			2
' i love my daughter just like when she was born , ' he added			0
' i blame the mamasan [ female pimp ] and the situation that we are in			2
' @entity119 , or female pimps , are a common sight in @entity2 and care little about the women they exploit			1
one , who appeared on camera but asked not to be named , revealed that there is nothing that can not be arranged for paying clients			2
' if a client wants to have sex , we 'll arrange the girl for them , ' she said			1
' also if the client has a special request and they want to sleep with a virgin i will find the girl for them			1
' i get a commission from client and girl			2
sometimes the girl is very grateful for my hard work so gives me extra money			2
' desperate situation : @entity42 said more needs to be done to help vulnerable women like @entity22 she admits that her career does make her feel ' bad ' but she does it for the money			1
' sometimes i do n't feel good about selling a virgin but i just think about the money , ' she explained			2
' sometimes as a mamasan i am hit or tortured by the client if i do n't find them a girl			2
i do have morals and sometimes i feel bad for the girl			0
' when i see the client walk away with the girl i think that i have become a very bad person			0
' sadly , sex trafficking and prostitution is booming in @entity2 , where an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 sex workers - 40 per cent of whom are under age - ply their trade			1
one charity which is trying to do something to help the underage victims of sex trafficking is @entity166 , which operates safe houses in @entity3			1
' lots of young girls gather here from @entity171 and they do n't know what the city is like , ' explains @entity174 , an aid worker at the charity			0
' they are an easy target for criminals			0
you can spot vulnerable people simply by their facial expressions			0
they might look naive or sad with problems			0
' but @entity174 said working for the charity can be fraught with danger			0
' i had a situation with a pimp when i tried to stop him taking a girl , ' he recalled			0
' the pimp was very angry and he threatened to shoot me			0
' i was very fortunate as there was a lot of people from the charity here			0
' but while @entity174 is safe , for @entity2 's thousands of virgin prostitutes , their ordeal goes on .			1
