@entity0 faced claims of a ‘ cover - up ’ last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the @entity6 @entity0 faced claims of a ‘ cover - up ’ last night for censoring a poll that suggests he is on course for a humiliating personal defeat in the @entity6			1
the secret @entity12 - commissioned poll , leaked to @entity13 , shows that @entity0 has fallen behind his @entity15 opponent in the @entity17 seat he is contesting			1
and he is in danger of finishing third , with @entity19 catching up fast			0
if the poll is accurate , it could end @entity0 ’s political career as he has vowed to resign as @entity12 leader if he fails to win @entity24			1
the @entity26 poll was commissioned last month by multimillionaire businessman and former @entity15 @entity28 , who defected to @entity12 last year and gave the party £ 1million			1
@entity12 hoped the @entity31 poll would echo an earlier one showing @entity0 heading for a famous victory , and they planned to use it to whip up more support			1
but when the result came through , @entity0 had a shock			0
it showed conservative candidate @entity40 , a former @entity12 activist , on 30 points , one ahead of @entity0 , with @entity19 only one behind			1
@entity0 was so alarmed he gave orders for the findings to be hushed up to avoid causing panic in @entity12 ranks – and encouraging his rivals			1
@entity12 officials spent last week trying to deny a cover - up			2
but yesterday , a spokesman finally admitted it had buried the survey , claiming the results were ‘ unreliable ’ and that it was a ‘ rogue poll ’			1
the censored poll is not the only sign that the wheels may be coming off @entity0 ’s bandwagon , nationally and locally			2
the party won last year ’s @entity60 elections with a sensational 27.5 per cent of the vote , compared to 24 for the conservatives			0
but nationally @entity12 ’s support is now down to 14 per cent , while the @entity63 have risen to 34			0
@entity12 hopes of becoming a major parliamentary force received a huge boost when two @entity15 defectors , @entity68 and @entity69 , won stunning by - election victories last year in @entity71 and @entity72 respectively			2
the poll showed conservative candidate @entity40 ( left ) , a former @entity12 activist , on 30 points , one ahead of @entity0			1
above , @entity40 is pictured with @entity76 campaigning however , the decline in support for @entity12 has led to most pundits predicting they will end up with a maximum of five mps in may			0
if the censored poll is accurate , @entity0 may not be one of them , and that will leave @entity12 in search of a new leader			1
@entity0 raised the @entity31 stakes dramatically when he said in his recent autobiography that he would stand down as leader if he loses			2
‘ the consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the @entity92 would be significant for me and the party , ’ he wrote			0
graphics show the results of the censored @entity31 poll ( above ) and the growing support for the @entity15 ( below ) ‘ it is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a @entity101 seat of my own			1
what credibility would @entity12 have in the @entity92 if others had to enunciate party policy in @entity105 and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest ? ’ he added : ‘ am i supposed to brief @entity12 policy from the @entity110 pub ? no – if i fail to win @entity24 , it is curtains for me			2
i will have to step down			0
’ if he resigns , @entity68 , considered almost certain to retain his @entity71 seat , is one of the favourites to succeed him			0
it could lead to a change in direction for @entity12 : @entity68 was horrified by @entity0 ’s comments about banning immigrants who are @entity121 positive			2
@entity68 could face a fight from the more telegenic @entity123 and former journalist @entity124			0
@entity125 has made stopping @entity0 in his tracks in @entity24 one of his top election priorities			0
the constituency was the first stop last week on @entity132 ’s election tour itinerary			0
@entity15 - supporting former @entity133 footballer @entity76 visited @entity24 yesterday to help the @entity135 campaign			0
@entity12 has accused the @entity63 of using ‘ dirty tricks ’ against @entity0			2
they rejected claims that photographs purporting to show him drinking in a pub in the constituency were in reality taken in a pub 70 miles away			0
a @entity12 spokesman said the @entity26 poll ’s headline figures greatly understated @entity0 ’s support because it included people who were not likely to vote and who tended to lean towards the traditional parties			1
‘ the poll shows that among those likely to vote , @entity0 is seven points ahead of both the conservatives and @entity19 in @entity24			1
’ a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ the fact that @entity12 commissioned this poll but then tried to cover it up when they did n’t like the results shows their true colours			1
’ @entity26 declined to comment			0
@entity26 interviewed 1,003 people in @entity24 between march 13 - 18 .			0
