by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 12 september 2013 @entity2 scientists have developed synthetic speech to make it easier for people to hear public announcements in crowded , noisy places like railway stations everyone has been stuck in an airport or train station terminal listening out for critical announcements , only to find it is almost impossible to understand the booming voice that erupts from the public address system			1
but these annoying messages could become a thing of the past as @entity2 scientists have developed synthetic speech to make it easier for people to hear public announcements in crowded , noisy places			1
researchers have come up with a system that they claim make announcements quieter and clearer by creating software that can alter speech before it is broadcast over speakers			2
the study , led by the @entity29 , looked into how speech is heard by listeners to improve upon the synthetic voice technology currently used			2
dr @entity33 , from the university 's @entity34 , said : ' noisy environments make it difficult to understand what is being said and simply making speech louder is nâ€™t the smartest solution			0
' ' our findings could offer an alternative , by making speech more intelligible without turning up the volume			0
' researchers carried out tests to pinpoint the components of speech that are most easily heard by people in a noisy place			2
they found that in loud environments , listeners pay most attention to the parts of speech that are the clearest and easiest to hear , in order to fill in the gaps and decipher the whole content of a message			0
dr @entity33 , said : ' noisy environments make it difficult to understand what is being said and simply making speech louder is n't the smartest solution			0
our findings could offer an alternative , by making speech more intelligible without turning up the volume ' the scientists developed a mathematical computer program to analyse spoken word and enhance and clarify sounds that listeners pick up on the most , in a bid to make messages easier to understand overall			1
testing the system , they discovered that listeners found the manipulated speech easier to understand than natural speech and in some cases the improvement was equivalent to lowering noise volume by five decibels			0
the scientists believe the research could also be used to improve smartphone voices and announcements on sat nav systems			1
the study was carried out with scientists from @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 and the findings presented at the @entity97 conference in @entity98			0
the scientists believe the research could also be used to improve smartphone voices and announcements on sat - nav systems ( pictured )			1
