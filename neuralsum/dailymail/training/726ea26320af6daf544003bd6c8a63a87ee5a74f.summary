@entity0 has revealed the interests of @entity2 will come first when a decision is made about @entity5 's future			1
@entity2 's sister club @entity6 want @entity5 to join them as planned in january for the new @entity9 season , no matter how well he plays while on loan in the @entity12 club in the meantime			1
but @entity2 boss @entity0 today underlined that the decision that is made will be motivated by his team 's needs			1
@entity5 is playing and scored two goals in the last game			1
in this moment he 's a very important player for us			2
' he will stay with us here on loan is until january and we will see what happens in the future and it 's not a problem we have to analyse in this moment			1
' we will see after when the loan has finished what we are going to do			2
' the possibility is to do the best for @entity2			1
' @entity5 is a very important player for @entity45 and the @entity12			1
all of you want to continue to see @entity5 here			1
' the @entity47 brushed off the criticism of @entity49 , who suggested @entity5 's short - term deal with @entity2 was questionable on moral grounds			1
' i do n't analyse what other managers say , ' said the @entity2 boss			1
@entity56 , left , and @entity57 , right , could feature in saturday 's fixture against @entity59 at the @entity60 @entity0 confirmed @entity56 and @entity57 could feature against @entity59 on saturday , but @entity61 and @entity62 will miss the game through injury			1
' we continue with @entity62 and @entity61 out of the team , ' said the 61 - year - old			1
' they will be ready next week and @entity68 also has a groin problem			1
' @entity56 [ @entity70 ] and @entity57 [ @entity57 ] are both okay			1
' the @entity47 boss was happy with the manner of @entity2 's 7 - 0 drubbing of @entity74 on wednesday on their comprehensive 7 - 0 win against @entity74 in the @entity77 , he said : ' i think it was very useful match for our team			1
we were n't scoring too many goals at home			0
' in the last four we did n't win , we are not playing bad but we did n't win			0
important to win the way we did on wednesday and we hope that can continue at @entity59 because in the @entity12 we ca n't drop many points			2
' i do n't know the reason [ why more goals are being conceded by clubs in the @entity12 ]			0
the same statistic about our team is not so good because we scored more in the first five games last season			0
' we did n't score against our rivals like @entity94 last year , and we did score this year , and similar against @entity95 and @entity96			0
in the whole of the @entity12 i really do n't know			0
' @entity99 starlet @entity98 scored in @entity2 's emphatic 7 - 0 @entity77 win against @entity74 young midfielder @entity98 , who was on the scoresheet midweek , is one of a crop of youngsters that @entity0 has high hopes for this campaign			1
' it 's important when you have the opportunity to give a chance to the young player to see that you 're not wrong , ' said @entity0			1
' @entity98 is a very good player			0
' now he 's coming back after a year out with his ankle			2
i 'm happy to give him the opportunity and i 'm happy because i see him work every day			0
' new @entity59 signing @entity113 celebrates scoring during their 2 - 2 draw with @entity117 on september 15 on this weekend 's opponents , he said : ' i think that @entity59 is a difficult team playing away			1
last year was maybe not our best game because @entity121 was sent off in the first 10 minutes			0
' we played really well and we won			0
i hope that his year we can do it in the same way but we will find it very tough at their home because they always play very strong			0
' @entity0 said he sees @entity129 as a valuable squad member at the @entity25 , despite the @entity45 international struggling for playing time this season			2
' i think that what @entity129 said is what every player would say , ' he explained			0
' they all want to play more games			0
@entity129 is an important player for our squad , he knows what i think about that			0
he 's always involved , some starting from the beginning or as a substitute but he 's always playing			0
' @entity0 insists @entity129 , right , remains an important member of his city squad despite limited playing time ' i do n't agree that money is the important thing , ' said @entity0 , when addressing the balance of power in the @entity12			2
' every team that wants to have chances to win the @entity12 must spend money on good players			0
we did n't spend more money than @entity94 , @entity156 or @entity157 in the last 10 years			0
every team has important players and has spent money but you do n't win just with money			0
' on the number of changes he made against @entity2 , which saw @entity165 and @entity121 drop out of the starting line - up , he replied : ' we had a squad and the whole squad will try to be a competitive team in the four competiions			2
that 's why we tried to make some rotations but not with some special names			2
' @entity0 refused to confirm who would start in goal after @entity176 played against @entity74			2
' we will see tomorrow who is starting , ' he replied			0

@entity0 says @entity2 will make a decision about @entity5 's future when his current loan deal finishes in the @entity26
