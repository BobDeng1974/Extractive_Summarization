by @entity0 internet connections between @entity2 and the outside world were cut off for at least 20 hours , according to data from @entity5 and other global @entity7 companies			1
@entity5 's @entity8 showed traffic to @entity5 services pages from the country , embroiled in a civil war that has lasted more than two years , suddenly stopping shortly before 7pm on tuesday			1
other firms such as @entity14 also revealed a total block on traffic			2
this chart shows the traffic dipping slightly just before 7pm and dropping completely			2
the traffic was not restored for at least four hours , and is not fully back online now @entity2 was without internet access for three days in november last year			1
while the government attributed the loss of the internet and cellphone service to ' terrorists ' , experts said the progressive shutdown of connectivity could only have been orchestrated by a central authority			1
during the november blackout the @entity2 people also lost telephone services			0
it is still unclear if phone service was cut off across the country in the latest shutdown			1
there was also a smaller blackout in january , but it only affected certain parts of the country and may have been caused by damage to cables due to fighting			2
@entity5 and @entity14 's traffic reports continued to show no activity there about 20 hours after the drop - off			1
full service has now been restored			1
this is the second time the country has experienced a web blackout in the past six months , with no - one claiming responsibility at this time			1
' we 've seen this twice before , ' said @entity57 , @entity5 's senior manager for free expression			1
' this happened in @entity2 last november and in @entity60 during the @entity61			0
' it is virtually impossible to definitely determine the cause of such disruptions unless a party claims responsibility , experts said			0
in the past , @entity2 's government and the rebels fighting to topple it have traded blame			0
@entity5 's data showed traffic disruptions limited to @entity2 and spanning the entire country			1
shutting an entire nation from the @entity7 is possible because @entity77 addresses , individual connections established by each device , are geographically specific and the government has control over the country 's internet service providers			1
the vast majority of websites within @entity2 were rendered unreachable as well , other experts said , as the county appeared to shut itself off			0
as during @entity61 disruptions , @entity5 said its @entity89 service , which broadcasts voice messages , was up and running in @entity2 for people with access to a phone			1
' effectively , the shutdown disconnects @entity2 from internet communication with the rest of the world			2
it 's unclear whether internet communication within @entity2 is still available , ' wrote @entity100 , chief technology officer at infrastructure services firm @entity101			2
' internet traffic in @entity2 took a sudden dip at around 7pm on tuesday and @entity5 's @entity8 found that web access had been cut off across the country			1
services were out for at least four hours and its unclear how much of the service has been restored			1
@entity2 experienced a three - day blackout last november			0
' although we ca n't yet comment on what caused this outage , past incidents were linked to both government - ordered shutdowns and damage to the infrastructure , which included fiber cuts and power outages			0
' @entity100 wrote on an @entity101 blog that a similar internet blackout in @entity2 occurred in november and lasted three days			0
about 80 internet pathways normally are listed by @entity2 providers , but only three were being advertised to machines searching for connections late on tuesday			2
@entity125 , chief technology officer at @entity126 , a @entity127 company that tracks global internet traffic , said the outage looked similar to the one seen last november			2
' the outage took place very quickly , was seen throughout the world , and ( with a few small technical exceptions ) covers the entire @entity2 internet , ' @entity125 said in an email to @entity136			0
' we do n't see any effects in neighboring countries , and we do n't see anything to suggest that the outage was caused by damage to one or another of the several cables that connect @entity2 with the outside world , ' he added			0
neither @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity127 nor the country 's envoy to the @entity148 could be reached for immediate comment			0
no comment was immediately available from the @entity151			0
the @entity152 in december condemned the previous network shutdown in @entity2 , calling it an ' indefensible violation of human rights ' and a ' dangerous and desperate interruption of the free flow of information			0
" video : @entity2 cut off from the internet for second time in six months			0
