in 2010 , the action of a friend changed @entity3 's life when an innocent push into a pool at her bachelorette party left her a quadriplegic			1
now a wife and an advocate for people with spinal cord injuries , she is hoping her life will be changed again by the actions of a friend â€” one who has agreed to carry her first child			0
@entity3 , 28 , plans to become a mother with the help of @entity19 , a friend she met while attending @entity20			1
@entity19 , 31 , has agreed to serve as a gestational surrogate for @entity3 and her husband , @entity22			1
paralyzed bride : @entity3 became paralyzed from the waist down after a tragic accident at her bachelorette party more than four years ago			1
pictured above at her @entity26 , @entity27 home on june 25 starting a family : @entity30 and her husband @entity22 ( pictured on their wedding day three years ago ) now plan on having a child through a surrogate however , not all have been supportive of @entity3 's decision to get pregnant , considering her physical handicap			1
when @entity3 wrote about her desire to become a mother through surrogacy on her blog on march , she received some negative feedback			1
' people will say , " she ca n't be a mom ; she 's in a wheelchair			2
" that 's a little frustrating , ' @entity3 said			1
' no one judges a single mother or a single father 's physical ability to raise a kid , so why am i a hindrance ? ' i can hold the baby			1
i 'll be able to change diapers and feed it and comfort it and dress it , ' she said			0
' all those things are going to take a little longer , but i can still do all those things			0
... i know plenty of people in wheelchairs who are parents who are amazing parents			0
' frustrating : some have criticized @entity30 's decision to become a mother through surrogacy , saying her physical handicap would impact her parenting abilities despite receiving some negative comments , the blog post also caught the attention of surrogate - to - be @entity19 , the former college friend who followed the couple 's story on social media			1
' when i saw that @entity3 was looking for a surrogate , i thought , " you know , this is something i really want to do , " ' @entity19 said			1
' ... she responded right away and said , " wow ! that 's the nicest thing anyone 's ever offered to do for me			2
" ' @entity19 , who lives in @entity84 with her husband and their 2 - year - old son , is scheduled to travel to @entity88 next month for the embryo transfer			2
' i was just assuming we would have to hire someone , ' said @entity3 , who has established an account with @entity94 to help cover expenses			1
' i think a lot of people were like , " what about one of the bridesmaids and the girl who did it ? " but none of those girls have ever been moms , ever been pregnant , are just not in that mind - set , i guess			2
that alone did n't make me feel comfortable			0
i wanted someone who had been pregnant before , who knew what they were doing			2
also , as far as the friend who was involved , i did n't want this to start off with guilt			0
' for @entity19 , the prospect of surrogacy is exciting			0
' i feel really good about it , ' she said			0
' they 're going to be great parents , and i 'm really excited to watch their family grow			0
' @entity3 and @entity22 also have not ruled out a second child			1
after the initial transfer , the couple plans to keep one embryo			0
' in 10 years , who knows where i 'll be physically ? ' @entity3 asked			1
' if there 's a cure in five years and i 'm able to carry one , i would love to have another one			1
' they are considering donating any remaining embryos to help change someone else 's life			2
' having the difficulty we 're having , ' @entity3 said , ' you know some couples just struggle forever			1
so ( for them ) to have a healthy embryo , eventually maybe i 'll donate one			0
' busy : in the four years since the accident , @entity30 has gotten married , and published a book titled ' @entity141 ' @entity3 is n't letting the negativity get to her			1
more than four years after her tragic accident and nearly three years after her idyllic wedding , @entity3 's life is going well			1
in the last three months , she has secured a surrogate , traveled to @entity88 for in vitro fertilization and released a book , ' the promise : a @entity150 , a @entity151			2
' that book was not part of the plan when @entity3 received her degree in recreation management in 2008			1
before the accident that left her paralyzed from the chest down , she worked as a program assistant at a seniors activity center and taught aerobics and line dancing			0
' i never enjoyed writing , ' @entity3 said			1
' i never enjoyed having to write a paper , so it was really interesting that once i had something to say ( i did )			0
' in ' @entity141 , ' which she wrote with former journalist and media consultant @entity168 , @entity3 has a lot to say			1
the book , released in may , not only retells the events of the now - famous accident following her bachelorette party but also shares the love story that brought her there			1
promises : in her book , @entity30 details the night of the accident but continues to protect the identity of the bridesmaid who pushed her into the pool @entity3 met her very first boyfriend and the man who would become her husband during her freshman year at @entity20 , just before @entity188 in 2004			1
though she and @entity22 are both from @entity190 , and they would later learn that their paths had crossed many times , they never knew one another until both were off at college , 150 miles from home			2
the two were best friends long before any romance blossomed			0
' my love story means so much to me , and everyone wanted the friend ( bridesmaids ) story , ' @entity3 said of the book , which originally was to be titled ' @entity208 , ' a reference to the fact that neither she nor her bridesmaids have ever disclosed the identity of the bridesmaid who pushed @entity3 into the pool			1
@entity30 and @entity22 are thinking about donating their remaining embryos to another couple struggling to get pregnant ' ( @entity208 ) made it sound like we all sat around and did like some blood promise to each other or something , ' she said			1
' we did n't sit there beside the pool and say this out loud			2
... ( @entity141 ) was supposed to mean not just my friends but also me and @entity22			2
' ' @entity141 ' does expound on the reasons behind the unspoken agreement to keep silent about the friend responsible for the push , a young woman who struggled with debilitating guilt and depression for years after the accident			0
in the book , the names of all the women who were by the pool the night of the accident have been altered			0
' none of us has ever revealed the name of the girl who playfully pushed me that night , and none of us ever will , ' @entity3 wrote			1
' protecting her has always been too important , her feelings too important , the situation too fragile and fraught with potential pain			0
besides , it could have been any one of us			0
' as the media relentlessly pursued the woman 's identity , the decision to withhold her friend 's name proved , at times , to be a costly one			0
one magazine offered to pay @entity3 for the revelation , and she turned down an interview with @entity260 after being told the talk show host wanted the bridesmaid in question to come on the show , too			1
@entity3 has learned to take both the criticism and the compliments in stride			1
' i appreciate the compliments , i guess , ' she said			0
' people were like , " that 's so amazing of you not to say anything			0
" ... i think i 've done a lot of amazing things , but not throwing my friend to the wolves while she was depressed is not one of them			0
' since the accident , @entity3 , a former lifeguard and cheerleader , has taken up wheelchair rugby and hand cycling			2
she has learned to surf and to drive again			0
she also has become a motivational speaker and an advocate for others with spinal cord injuries			0
though @entity3 has had a chance to personally reach out to a fellow @entity26 resident who was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident , most of the encouragement she offers has been virtual			2
' ( people ) sent letter after letter to my @entity296 inbox and my email , ' she wrote			0
' ... people wanted to relate to me and wrote things like " my son had this happen to him , " or " i am married to a quadriplegic			0
" they were trying to connect , and i quickly learned i had the strength to help them			0
' fans of ' @entity141 ' already are asking if there will be a sequel on motherhood			0
@entity3 said she plans to blog about her experience and has not ruled out a second book .			2

@entity3 , 28 , became a quadriplegic four years ago after a bridesmaid playfully pushed her into a pool at her bachelorette party
now @entity30 and her husband @entity22 are starting the process of getting pregnant via a surrogate
however , @entity30 's desire to become a mother has been met with some criticism by those who believe her handicap will hinder her parenting
