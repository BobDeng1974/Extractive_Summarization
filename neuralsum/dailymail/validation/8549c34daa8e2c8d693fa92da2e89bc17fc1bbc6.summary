a real estate investment trust that 's considering getting out of the snow business could end up making the largest single ski resort transaction in the sport 's history			1
@entity6 owns more than a dozen ski resorts from @entity8 to @entity9 that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars			1
if @entity6 sells all of its 16 properties to one buyer , industry officials say it would be the biggest real estate transaction in the history of skiing			2
reits bring in revenue through rent paid by ski resort operators like @entity53 - based @entity52 , which holds long - term leases for @entity18 , @entity30 and @entity32			2
a @entity56 official said skiers need n't worry about the potential sale of their beloved ski mountains			0
@entity59 , president of eastern operations for @entity56 , said : ' for the skier , it 's a nonevent			0
' @entity6 managing director @entity63 said the trust will make decisions ' in the near future ' @entity56 will remain the lease holder , regardless of ski resort ownership , for several more decades			2
@entity69 , who skies 70 to 80 days a year at @entity71 and recently bought a retirement home in the area , said most skiers are pleased with the investments that have been made since @entity6 bought the resort and @entity56 began running it in 2007			0
he said : ' i would n't have made that kind of financial commitment and lifetime commitment if i did n't believe there was stability and a good future			0
' ski resorts , which are at the mercy of weather and the economy , can be good investments as long the owners have a long investment horizon , said @entity91 from @entity92			0
the trust will evaluate options for its remaining properties ' in the near future ' , according to @entity6 senior managing director @entity63			1
besides selling its ski resorts , theme parks and marinas , alternatives include a private buyout or listing on a publicly traded exchange			1
ideally , the remaining properties would be sold and @entity6 enlisted investment bank @entity106 to help evaluate options			1
@entity63 said : ' we 're taking a studied and careful approach			0
' if the resorts do sell , skiers might not even notice because the operators ' long - term leases will remain in place reits are an investment vehicle for a variety of properties including hotels , office buildings and malls , but they are new to the ski industry in the last 15 or so years			1
there 's only one other reit that 's a big player in the ski industry besides @entity6			0
@entity6 was valued at as much as $ 3billion in 2012 with ownership of more than 100 water parks , ski resorts , marinas and senior housing developments			2
the trust 's value dropped in the aftermath of a real estate downturn			0
the @entity1 is nearing the end of its projected lifespan and anticipates having an ' exit strategy ' in place by dec. 31			1
in june , @entity6 agreed to sell 48 golf properties for $ 320million			2
then it announced an agreement to sell its senior housing for $ 790million in december			0
besides selling the resorts , alternatives include a private buyout or listing on a publicly traded exchange			1

@entity6 could sell off all the properties it owns in one deal
firm owns resorts such as @entity30 in @entity8 and @entity39 in @entity40
besides selling the resorts off in one deal , other options include a private buyout or a listing on a publicly traded exchange
the investment trust anticipates having an ' exit strategy ' by december 31
whether resorts are sold or not , skiing experience should remain similar
