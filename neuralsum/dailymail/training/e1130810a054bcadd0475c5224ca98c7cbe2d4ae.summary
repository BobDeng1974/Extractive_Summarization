by @entity0 a @entity2 pensioner who has had both feet amputated has been refused a blue disabled parking badge – because he is able to walk ' more than 20 yards '			1
@entity5 , 73 , had the lower part of both legs removed in operations last year after doctors discovered that his irregular heartbeat was causing circulation problems in his legs			1
he was granted a provisional blue badge to let him park in disabled spaces but when he tried recently to renew it , he was told that because he could walk 20 yards he was not eligible			1
' i applied for a blue badge last year and they gave me one for a year			2
when i spoke to them , they said , " this is a provisional one " and i said to them , " what do you expect – the leg to grow back ? " ' i was told i could walk more than 20 yards			1
they said it more than once			0
' it 's a struggle			2
my friend from across the road comes and takes me because when i go out , i take a wheelchair because i do n't trust myself not to fall			2
' i 'm really annoyed and really upset			0
i was so angry when i was told that i would not be eligible for one because i can walk a short distance with my crutches			1
' i could n't get from my front door to my car			1
' mr @entity5 was told that the ability to walk 20 yards was part of the assessment for blue badge eligibility			1
he said : ' am i disabled or am i not ? i 've lost both my legs and if i 'm not , what else do i need amputated ? ' because of my age i do n't get any help from the government – no disability allowance and i even have to pay for my own road tax because i do n't qualify			1
' the only concession i have is a blue badge and they 're threatening to take it away from me			0
i 'll not be able to go up the street			0
upset : the retired @entity59 has ' put himself through hell ' to walk and asks ' what else do i need to get amputated ' in order to qualify as disabled ' i put myself through hell to try to walk			1
i 'm ok in the house but when i go out you have no idea			0
' you think you 're walking on a level surface but when you get a prosthetic leg you have to keep an eye on the road all the time			0
your foot will catch and it will trip you over			0
' mr @entity5 started having problems when he went on a cruise holiday in @entity77 and felt what he thought was cramp down his right leg			1
after returning , he visited hospital but even after numerous tests doctors were unable to identify the cause of his problems			0
then one day while going upstairs in his home he collapsed with a severe pain down his side			0
after more tests at @entity90 in @entity91 medics found he had an irregular heartbeat which was causing circulation problems			0
mr @entity5 said : ' they took my left leg off – it was really painful			2
' he was later told his right lower leg would also have to be amputated and another prosthetic limb fitted			0
he said : ' a blue badge is for the disabled			0
surely that classes me as disabled ? ' @entity17 has now told him he will have to go for a mobility assessment with an occupational therapist in an attempt to resolve the situation			2
initial applucation : mr @entity5 was granted a provisional blue badge to let him park in disabled spaces but when he tried recently to renew it , he was told that because he could walk 20 yards he was not eligible @entity109 , @entity17 's lead professional for accessible transport and concessions , said all councils had to follow a code of practice issued by @entity115 when evaluating blue badge applications			1
she added : ' this is national practice , not council policy , and the rules laid out in this guidance are very specific			0
' common sense would suggest that he is eligible for a blue badge but the way his mobility was described in his application did not meet the national scheme criteria			1
' we explained this to mr @entity5 over the phone and are continuing to discuss the situation with him			2

@entity5 , 73 , from @entity22 , @entity17 , had the lower part of both legs removed
retiree 's provisional badge was *revoked* because he can ' walk 20 yards '
describes how he has been ' through hell ' to walk and ca n't reach his car
a @entity17 *spokesman* said ' common sense ' would suggest he is eligible
