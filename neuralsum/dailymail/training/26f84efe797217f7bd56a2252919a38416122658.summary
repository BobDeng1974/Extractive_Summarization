his abstract art has been criticised and praised in equal measure for its haphazard use of paint			0
but new research has found @entity7 's drip painting may have more in common with the stylised portraits from the @entity10 period than first thought			1
researchers used advanced image analysis techniques to assess the colour use , brightness and contrast of nearly 8,800 paintings created between the 11th and 19th centuries			2
@entity7 's drip paintings ( left ) were found to have a lot in common with medieval art ( a painting by @entity23 pictured right ) due to his use of a limited pallet of colours and lack of blending of pigments they found that the palette of colours used by artists in @entity34 has expanded through history , with painters in @entity10 producing some of the dullest artworks			1
through each period of history , the paintings showed explosions in the variety and complexity of the pigments and tints used , which coincided with the appearance of artist movements			0
the scientists also discovered that artists in each period of history tended to favour a different colour that appears in the majority of work from that time			1
it suggests that even great masters , who led many of the great art movements in @entity34 , were slaves to the fashions of the time			2
however , while most art seems to have evolved since the @entity62 to use increasing levels of vibrancy and complex colour use , @entity7 's modern abstract expressionist paintings are more like @entity21 - at least as far as the way they reflect light			1
the researchers say that while mr @entity7 deliberately chose a limited palette for his drip paintings , @entity10 artists were simply constrained by the materials available to them			1
@entity7 created his controversial art during the 1940s by dropping paint onto a canvas , but the stark images he created may actually have more in common with medieval art than may be apparent at first the analysis used by the scientists was able to detect the sfumato technique used by @entity83 to fade between objects and background in his @entity86 ( left ) , along with the chiaroscuro technique to create strong light and dark contrasts , as used in by @entity90 in @entity91 ( right ) the scientists assessed the colour brightness of each painting , like in this example @entity96 from the @entity97 by @entity23			1
@entity99 colours have a greater height on the y - axis professor @entity102 , a statistical physicist who led the study at the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , said : ' there is a strong preference in a small number of selected colors in the medieval age			2
' the medieval period is close to that of @entity7 ’s drip paintings where he used limited colors intentionally			1
' we find that these mathematical measurements quantitatively describe the birth of new painting techniques and their increasing use			0
the researchers examined digital images of 8,798 western paintings dating from the 11th century to the mid- 19th century			2
they divided the paintings into 10 historical periods - @entity10 , @entity62 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , and @entity133			0
they used techniques including chromo - spectroscopy , which treats colours like words and ranks them according to their level of use , and fractal pattern analysis , which looks at the detail contained within the colour			2
the study , which is published in the journal @entity147 , found that the colour palette among @entity34 painters expanded greatly after the @entity10 period as new oil paints and pigments were introduced			0
' applying them , it is possible to deduce that the @entity7 ’s drip paintings are not typical art work , and of course , these are still controversial in the art world			1

colour brightness and contrast also changed with different styles through the @entity127 , such as sfumato - the gradual fading between object and background used by @entity83 - and chiaroscuro - strong contrasts between light and dark used in the 17th century by @entity90			0
paintings by @entity184 ( bottom ) used far duller colours than many of the images that were analysed the scientists used image analysis techniques to study 8,798 @entity34 paintings from the 11th century among the images they examined were @entity194 from the @entity97 by medieval @entity195 painter @entity23 , @entity196 by @entity198 painter @entity197 and a sunday on @entity199 by 19th century painter @entity200			1
professor @entity102 said : ' using digital image processing techniques , we investigate three quantitative measures of images - the usage of individual colors , the variety of colors , and the roughness of the brightness			0
' we found a difference in color usage between classical paintings and photographs , and a significantly low color variety of the medieval period			1
' rank - ordered color - usage distribution for all periods of paintings show quite universal distribution			0
however , the most commonly painted color is different for each period			0
' one can find the reason why the box counting dimensions for the medieval age and @entity7 are different from others in the historical facts			1
' first , specific rare pigments were preferred for political purposes and religious reasons in the medieval age despite their expensive cost			0
a sunday on @entity199 by @entity200 proved particularly challenging to analyse due to his style of building up pictures with dots of primary colour and the scientists showed that he used very few colours @entity7 's paintings used fewer colours than medieval art and were similar to those of neoclassicism but he used his colours in similar ways to the @entity10 painters in terms of the amount of detail and mixing ' second , no technique of physical mixing between different pure colors was used in that period due to the tendency to emphasize the purity of colors and materials themselves			1
' artists recoated on a colored canvas to represent various colors in the middle age			0
' the drip paintings of @entity7 are also formed from recoating each single color dripping pattern on other layers , and the number of used colors is smaller than other western paintings before 20th century			1
' furthermore , oil colors and color mixing techniques were not fully developed until the @entity62 age			0
' the introduction of new expression tools , like pastels and fingers , and painting techniques , such as chiaroscuro and sfumato , made much more colorful and natural expressions possible after the renaissance period			0
' the difference of fractal dimensions between the medieval and other periods quantitatively may quantitatively reflect the historical facts and the painting technical difference in art history			2
' however , professor @entity102 does concede that some of the analysis of the paintings will be affected by the fading of paints and pigments over time , meaning that the medieval pictures may have been more vibrant in the past .			1

@entity7 's drip paintings were found to be similar to medieval art
medieval paintings were found to contain the dullest and fewest colours
scientists say their analysis shows @entity7 's paintings are not typical art
paintings from each century feature different common colours that appear to have been *favourites* of artists at the time and were *regularly* used
