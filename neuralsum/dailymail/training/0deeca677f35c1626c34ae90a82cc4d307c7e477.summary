by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:23 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 11:53 est , 17 november 2013 @entity4 destroyer @entity2 has docked in the @entity5 and is preparing to distribute aid to areas not yet reached by humanitarian workers			1
the ship 's @entity9 has spent three days surveying @entity11 and other islands near @entity13 , where @entity2 has docked			1
it will now be used to take 500 shelter kits and 10 tonnes of high energy biscuits to isolated areas , while the ship will use its water filters to fill 1,900 water carriers with clean drinking water			0
' this @entity49 vessel will help us open a lifeline and allow us to help many more victims of the disaster			0
' a @entity46 flight is also due to depart @entity55 later today , loaded with more than 95 tonnes of aid including water and sanitation equipment along with vital supplies on behalf of @entity60 and @entity61			1
' more @entity4 help is on its way , ' ms @entity42 added			2
' the @entity4 people have shown huge generosity over the past days and @entity46 is working with charities to make sure all their donations get to those who need it most			1
' the news comes after donations to the @entity4 disaster appeal topped £ 33million and @entity29 praised the country for ' taking the lead ' in international aid efforts , while also pledging £ 30million more in government funding , bring the total to £ 50million			1
the @entity79 government says it is ready to send rescue and medical teams to the neighbouring @entity5 , more than a week after @entity27 struck			1
in a press release from the @entity83 , the country said teams would depart ' if weather permitted ' while the communist nation pledged just £ 1.2million ( $ 2m ) in aid			2
the sum , more than forty times smaller than the @entity4 's pledge of £ 50million , is seen by some as the result of a dispute over the @entity94 islands			1
the collection of 250 islands , most of which are under water at high tide , have long been claimed by both countries			0
there was no immediate indication whether the aid teams were preparing to depart or whether the @entity5 government had accepted the @entity79 offer			2
@entity107 expressed on the @entity79 internet have argued strongly against aiding the @entity5 , despite the potential damage to @entity111 's hopes of being regarded as a responsible regional leader			0
speaking on behalf of the 14 @entity4 charities which make up the @entity115 , chief executive @entity113 said : ' the generosity of the public is yet again surpassing all expectations			2
' it is now eight days since @entity27 - the strongest storm ever to make landfall - struck , and virtually wiped the city of @entity26 off the map			1
@entity2 , a type 45 destroyer , will join a 12 - strong team of @entity4 doctors , surgeons and paramedics are already in the crisis zone , helping to treat survivors of the disaster			1

two @entity135 diggers , two @entity136 and a forklift truck were also delivered to @entity13 airport yesterday by an @entity140 c - 17 aircraft			0
@entity141 , @entity4 ambassador to the @entity5 , was at the airport to meet yesterday morning 's delivery			2
he said : ' the significance of this load is that it is heavy machinery : bulldozers , land rovers , machines that can actually push through the debris that is blocking aid now			0
' this is vital equipment because the @entity5 military and others have not been able to bring this material here			0
' this afternoon a @entity60 barge carrying 25 tonnes of aid is also due to arrive in the region			1
meanwhile @entity79 has drawn criticism after pledging just $ 2million ( £ 1.2m ) in aid			0
the @entity79 government also announced today that it is ready to send aid workers to the neighbouring country , more than a week after the disaster unfolded			1
@entity2 will join a 12 - strong team of @entity4 doctors , surgeons and paramedics ( file picture ) the ship 's helicopter has been cataloging the devastation on islands which have n't been reached by rescue teams			1
here a collection of buildings has been ruined on a small island adjacent to the @entity180 island desperate survivors have taken to scrawling messages for help on any surface they can find the lackluster response is blamed by some on a dispute over the @entity94 islands , which have long been claimed by both nations			0
a number of @entity4 are missing following @entity27 , foreign secretary @entity191 confirmed yesterday			1
among those feared dead is @entity193 , 61 , from @entity194 , @entity195 , who was staying with his @entity5 partner @entity196 , 35 , and their three - year - old daughter @entity197 near the city of @entity26 when the storm struck			2
@entity200 said mr @entity193 was visiting his girlfriend 's relatives and had hired a beach house in @entity204 , one of the ravaged coastal villages			0
the mother of mr @entity193 's partner , 79 - year - old @entity208 , showed the programme the wreckage of the beach house where her daughter and granddaughter were staying , and said they had not been seen since the typhoon struck eight days ago			0
in this photo taken from the @entity140 helicopter the sheer power of the storm can be seen as it washed this cargo vessel up and left it stranded on a beach a @entity221 747 at @entity55 is being loaded with aid packages and is due to arrive in @entity13 tomorrow a @entity224 spokesman said mr @entity191 spoke on the phone to @entity5 secretary for foreign affairs @entity227 to offer his condolences			1
' the foreign secretary confirmed that a number of @entity4 nationals remained unaccounted for , ' the spokesman added			0
' he asked that every possible assistance be given to any @entity4 people caught up in the disaster			2
' @entity49 aircraft carrier @entity236 is being sent to replace @entity2 , which had just begun an exercise in the @entity94 when it was tasked to join the humanitarian relief effort			0
the latest death toll given by mr @entity29 is an increase of more than 1,000 on estimates made by the country 's civil defence agency earlier this week			2
