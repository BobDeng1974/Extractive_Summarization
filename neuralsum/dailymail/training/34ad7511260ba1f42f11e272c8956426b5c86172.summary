' @entity22 was 12 and living with her grandmother in @entity2 when she first came across @entity123 in january 2008			1
he was 22 – ten years her senior – but plied her with cigarettes and alcohol , and she eventually started to meet him in the town centre			0
she said : ' @entity6 used to tell me he loved me and had feelings about me			1
' he treated me like a princess and said my family did not love me and did n't want me			0

' @entity6 also introduced her to his older brother @entity136 and his cousin @entity6 – who both groomed her for sex			1

the pictures give no sign of the horrors that awaited her when she met her abuser			0
at 14 , she fell for the man ten years her senior who groomed her into a violent relationship and separated her from her family			2
@entity170 's childhood photos are like any other young girl 's , but they show no sign of the horrors that awaited her when she met her abuser yet council workers and police acted as if she was to blame for getting involved with the convicted criminal , she claimed			0
she said one officer , attending an incident where her abuser had threatened to kill her , even told her : ' well , what did you expect ? ' @entity170 – not her real name – was attacked several times by the man , who had served two jail terms , but said police did nothing to help her and saw the assaults as just ' a bit of domestic violence '			0
her desperate parents had her put into care , hoping it would end the relationship , but she said carers openly allowed him to continue visiting			0
yesterday she called on @entity12 pcc @entity211 , responsible for @entity2 children 's services , from 2005 to 2010 , to resign			0
@entity170 , now 29 , said : ' he should be ashamed of himself			0
the more he holds on to his job , the harder it will be for victims to move forward			0
