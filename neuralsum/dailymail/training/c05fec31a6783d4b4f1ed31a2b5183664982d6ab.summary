mr @entity9 intervened after @entity28 ’s first minister @entity27 threatened to quit unless there was a full inquiry into @entity32 ’s release , claiming was kept in the dark about the system			1
the judge , who has not yet been named , will be allowed to quiz mr @entity3 , former @entity28 secretary @entity35 and @entity37 figures about the letters , which have been branded ‘ dirty deals ’ by @entity39			1
mr @entity3 was prime minister when the system was set up by mr @entity35 in 2005			1
187 letters have been sent to @entity8 men who were on the run telling them they will not face trial on the basis of the evidence against them			0
but @entity32 , who has been blamed for the bomb blast that killed four soldiers and seven horses , escaped trial because he was mistakenly sent a letter			1
the inquiry will check whether others have been incorrectly sent the letters and has the power to recommend an end to the system			2
mr @entity9 yesterday made clear that if new evidence emerges against a suspect they could still be prosecuted			1
‘ it is important to set out the facts of what has happened , ’ he said			0
‘ when we came to power in 2010 , we inherited a process where letters were sent , setting out the factual position on whether or not some individuals were wanted for questioning by the police			0
‘ this process continued under this government			0
there was never any amnesty or guarantee of immunity for anyone , and there is n’t now			0
’ the prime minister said the judge would report back by the end of may and the report would be published			1
a catastrophic blunder let the @entity32 , the man accused of the @entity25 bombing in 1982 walk free from court ‘ the judge will have full access to government files and government officials			1
this needs to happen quickly			0
it ’s right that we should take swift action			2
it ’s such a dreadful mistake that we have to make absolutely sure that other letters were not sent in error			2
’ mr @entity9 said that he did not want to ‘ unpick ’ the decisions of his predecessors when pushing the peace process forward			1
‘ very difficult decisions were taken around the time of the @entity105 and around the time of the peace process			0
’ but a no 10 spokesman made clear that the judge could call for an end to the letters scheme altogether			2
‘ he will be able to make recommendations on this or related matters			0
’ a @entity115 source said ‘ serving ministers and officials will have to give evidence if asked ’			0
while mr @entity3 could not be forced to do so he is expected to cooperate if asked			0
@entity32 , who has been blamed for the bomb blast that killed four soldiers and seven horses , escaped trial because he was mistakenly sent a letter mr @entity27 welcomed the inquiry and mr @entity9 ’s insistence that paramilitaries who have had letters could still be charged if further evidence against them emerges			1
withdrawing his threat of resignation , he said : ‘ i think that makes it clear that they have a fairly worthless piece of paper			0
i think there will be a lot of on - the - runs who will sleep less easy tonight			2
’ former @entity140 leader @entity139 said he knew ‘ nothing ’ about the letters and said the inquiry must find out who signed off the scheme			2
he said : ‘ i would dearly love to know who signed off those letters			0
we need to find out how this process came into existence and how it operated			0

@entity139 said : ‘ the people who are making comments that this was all part of the peace process , it was not			0
the @entity105 , which had a provision for prisoner release , was quite clear there was only prisoner release , there would be no amnesties			1
