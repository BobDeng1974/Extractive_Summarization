‘ whilst i believe the @entity15 will remain an open economy and society that welcomes hard - working and aspiring people from across @entity5 , to hide our heads in the sand and pretend that the free movement of people across the @entity56 does not come with some negative consequences is utter nonsense			0
‘ the issue of immigration is one of the biggest concerns of taxpayers across many @entity56 countries , and the impact on wages , access to benefits , and ‘ social dislocation ’ all need to be addressed in the context of large scale migration in the @entity56			2
she added : ‘ member states must be able to decide who should be allowed to access their welfare			0
’ mrs @entity4 made her comments an online discussion			1
she claimed that ‘ most of the things which are told to the people in @entity18 are myths , have nothing to do with reality			2
’ ‘ coming back to the subject which the government of the @entity15 has pushed to the agenda , probably in order not to make people speak about the real subjects in the @entity15 , are this supposed invasion of foreigners coming to the @entity15 and stealing the jobs and stealing the social security and the health money			0
‘ the free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections			1

@entity22 mep @entity128 said instead of ' populism ' the @entity130 should have used the word ' democracy ' the government has also floated broader proposals to rein in @entity56 free movement rules , a sacred cow for @entity137			1
earlier this week mrs @entity4 , who is vice-president of the @entity104 , called for the @entity56 to become a ‘ @entity138 ’ with the @entity139 as its government			1
