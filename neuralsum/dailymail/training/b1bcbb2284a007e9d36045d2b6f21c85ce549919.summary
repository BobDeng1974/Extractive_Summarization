@entity2 fly - half @entity0 believes a few rounds of boxing in the ring might help to keep him away from trouble outside it			1
@entity0 will feature alongside dual code international @entity8 and @entity11 rugby league veteran @entity10 in a ' @entity12 ' in @entity13 on january 31 for his third professional bout			1
like @entity8 , whose fights have not been universally popular in his home country of @entity18 , @entity0 's enthusiasm for boxing has been tolerated rather than welcomed by the @entity19			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity8 appear in front of the media in @entity13 on friday @entity0 's third professional bout will take place in @entity13 on january 31 but @entity0 said @entity2 coach @entity24 had thrown his support behind him , offering to buy him a pair of gloves			1
' i looked at it as a different way to do some fitness , ' @entity0 said			2
' i was going to look at finding a gym and do some boxing anyway and @entity24 just hit me up and said he 'll go buy some gloves			2
' to me , that was him reaching out			0
he knew it was something that i enjoyed doing and he went out of his comfort zone to help me improve at something that i enjoy doing			0
' though @entity0 's vocal criticism of former coach @entity43 ' playing style landed him in hot water a couple of years ago , the 26 - year - old has had a clean record off - field in recent seasons , in contrast to his strife - filled early playing days			2

' after my first tour , i got into a bit of trouble because all i wanted to do was drink alcohol , ' he said			0
' so it 's great having another outlet to help me stay fit and focused			0
' the difficult part is seeing everybody else go on holidays but understanding this is my choice			0
' i think ( boxing ) benefits me not only as an athlete but as a person ... this is pretty much the most difficult time to be able to stay focused on any kind of working out			0
' @entity0 and @entity8 , both born in @entity85 , @entity18 , are close friends			1
