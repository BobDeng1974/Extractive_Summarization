@entity0 , leader of the @entity2 group at the @entity3 , says cuts to frontline services such as rubbish collections are inevitable bins could be collected just once a month across large parts of @entity9 , a senior @entity2 council leader warned yesterday			1
@entity0 said cuts to frontline services such as rubbish collections were inevitable after funding for local authorities was slashed again			1
council chiefs said communities secretary @entity14 ’ latest cuts – part of wider plans to tackle @entity9 ’s budget deficit – would reduce funding by around £ 2.6billion next year			1
but mr @entity0 , leader of the @entity2 group at the @entity3 , said years of cuts meant budgets were already facing huge pressure from rising school rolls and soaring social care costs			1
a handful of councils are already considering a move to general rubbish collections every three or four weeks to save money			2
mr @entity0 , leader of @entity32 in @entity33 , suggested the number is now almost certain to rise			1
‘ to a certain extent we are our own worst enemy – we have managed the reductions really well , ’ he said			0
‘ we are getting reductions out of the services people do n’t really bother about			0
but we ca n’t keep doing that – another £ 3billion [ of ] cuts will be pushing some councils close to the edge			2
' some of our councils , probably 60 or 70 per cent , will start reducing services that people notice next year			0
‘ already some of our members are talking about emptying the dustbins once every four weeks			0
’ the warning is a blow to mr @entity14 , who is under fire for failing to keep his pledge to restore weekly bin rounds			1
a spokesman for the minister said they still had scope to make ‘ sensible ’ cuts without hitting services			0
she added : ‘ this settlement is fair and a lot better than local government was expecting			0
' refuse collections are negotiated over a period of years so any council trying to use this an excuse to move to monthly collections is trying to play politics and not being honest with taxpayers			1
’ government sources last night accused councils of scaremongering , and said local authorities were still sitting on large reserves			1
but shadow local government secretary @entity80 said there was mounting evidence that cuts are driving reductions in bin collections			2
rubbish : problems are piling up , with council chiefs warning more councils will consider doing bin collections every three or four weeks mr @entity89 said : ‘ @entity14 used to boast that he would protect weekly bin collections – then he was found out			1
now even @entity2 council leaders are saying he has failed and that his policies are actually making things worse			0
’ earlier this month , the @entity94 revealed families are now having to wait an average 12 days to have their general rubbish collected			0
a survey of local authorities found just 6 per cent now collect all bins on a weekly basis			0
council chiefs say @entity14 ' latest cuts will reduce funding by around £ 2.6bn next year this despite the @entity2 ’ repeated pledge that they would restore people ’s ‘ fundamental right ’ to have their bins emptied once a week			1
mr @entity14 and @entity109 have spent almost a decade pledging to restore the weekly bin round			1
in office mr @entity14 unveiled a £ 250million fund to help councils deliver on the pledge – but the number of councils operating weekly bin rounds has continued to decline			1
a number of councils have already floated the idea of restricting household rubbish collections to once every three or four weeks			2
but @entity121 , founder of the @entity122 , said : ‘ it ’s one thing talking about doing monthly collections in the winter , but in the summer there will be all sorts of problems			2
‘ the obvious one is odours , but there are also problems with maggots because of infiltration by flies			0
’ yesterday it emerged mr @entity14 has also lost a @entity138 battle to force councils to hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax bills by more than 1 per cent			1
the move was opposed by the @entity143 , and the existing 2 per cent level will now be kept			0
but , for the fifth year in a row , councils will be offered cash to help them freeze council tax bills if they want			2
announcing the settlement in the @entity151 , the local government minister @entity149 said councils ’ overall spending power would be trimmed by just 1.8 per cent – one of the smallest cuts since 2010			2
mr @entity149 said no council would lose more than 6.4 per cent of its total spending			0
but the @entity3 said central funding for councils was being slashed by 8.6 per cent			0
@entity161 leader @entity160 warned of ‘ cutbacks in a whole range of areas that people are going to really start noticing now ’ .			0

@entity14 ' latest cuts will reduce funding by £ 2.6bn , council chiefs claim
@entity0 said years of cuts means budgets already under huge pressure
