the country ’s top judge said the @entity18 would be ‘ aware ’ of the threat to sergeant @entity3 from @entity21 extremists and ‘ take steps to minimise it ’ as they did with child abusers			1
but lord @entity25 , the lord chief justice , defended allowing the disgraced 39 - year - old commando to be named publicly because it was ‘ very firmly ’ in the interests of open justice			1
explaining the decision to lift an anonymity order on @entity3 - known previously as @entity3 - he said it would be wrong to conceal the identity of a convicted murderer			1
the senior non-commissioned officer is serving at least ten years in a civilian prison for murder after being found guilty by a court martial last month			0
@entity3 shot the unidentified injured insurgent in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol on september 15 , 2011 , then taunted him : ‘ shuffle off this mortal coil			1
’ he told colleagues on the patrol from @entity47 , @entity48 : ‘ obviously this does n’t go anywhere fellas			0
i just broke the @entity51			0
’ harrowing film and audio of the killing were recorded on a helmet - mounted camera worn by a comrade			0
@entity3 , the first @entity4 serviceman convicted of murder on active service abroad since at least the @entity7 , was finally named this month after losing a year - long legal battle to keep his identity secret			1
the senior non-commissioned officer is serving at least ten years in a civilian prison for murder after being found guilty by a court martial last month lord @entity25 , sitting with mr @entity65 and mr @entity66 , stripped the @entity9 of the anonymity granted during his court martial despite fears expressed by his legal team that he and his family would be targeted by @entity21 terrorists			2
outlining the reasons for the decision , he said there was ‘ the greatest public interest in knowing who he was and his background , given his conviction ’			0
he pointed out : ‘ it would require an overwhelming case if a person convicted of murder in the course of an armed conflict were to remain anonymous			0
’ the judge said : ‘ there is a risk to @entity3 that he will be attacked in prison and after his release from what will have to be a life sentence			2
‘ the prison authorities will be well aware of that risk and take steps to minimise it , as they do for other offenders at risk of attack in prison such as paedophiles			2
‘ there is the threat assessed by the @entity105 [ @entity106 ] to his family and to @entity3 on his release under licence from his life sentence			2
‘ it is a known risk			0
the @entity112 has taken steps in the past to protect the families of the @entity9			0
there is nothing to suggest that they would not do in the future			0
‘ balancing those considerations , we have no doubt that the balance comes very firmly down on the side of open justice ; the identity of @entity3 must be made public			1
