by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 18:49 est , 18 april 2013 it 's one of @entity3 ’s most desirable addresses with five - star hotels and fabulous views over @entity6			1
but the @entity8 travellers who have descended on @entity9 are not the most welcome of visitors			1
suitcases in tow , they have taken over a patch of grass near @entity16 and it is feared they may set up a camp			1
back on the scene : @entity8 beggars have been pictured setting up camp in @entity16 once again going nowhere : the group was pictured huddle together chatting or sleeping on the grass nearby nuisance : others were pictures gathered in the doorway of a luggage shop drinking cups of tea a 40 - strong band did exactly that a year ago , turning the site into a rubbish dump and being accused of knife - point robberies and other crimes			1
yesterday @entity36 , who has a burger van at @entity16 , said the new arrivals were bad for tourism			2
he said he had just seen two @entity8 women ‘ pull their skirts down , squat down and go to the toilet ’			2
he added : ‘ there were tourists going by on those open - top buses , people everywhere , they did n’t care			1
‘ the police do n’t seem to be doing anything			2
‘ all they seem to be doing is going up and checking passports and then just let them go			2
taking a nap : it is not yet clear if these travellers are part of the same gang who blighted @entity16 last year problem : police and @entity63 faced a long - running battle to remove the travellers last summer @entity65 : the beggars have gathered in sight of some of the capital 's top hotels ‘ when i get here in the morning there are usually about 60 - 70 of them			1
they are drinking and begging			0
it ’s ruining the tourism			0
’ @entity77 , 31 , on holiday with a friend from @entity80 , said she saw one of the group urinating in the underpass			1
‘ he just looked at me , he was drunk , ’ she added			0
‘ i could n’t believe it and i ’m from @entity80			0
i do n’t know why the police do n’t just lock them up , that ’s what would happen in @entity89			0
‘ they have been begging			0
it is the sort of thing that would put me off coming to @entity3 again			0
’ @entity95 is preparing itself for a predicted influx of @entity8 – and @entity97 – when they are given free access to our jobs market in january			0
ministers have refused to put an estimate on how many migrants will travel here but campaign group @entity105 has warned it could be 50,000 every year for five years from 2014 .			1
