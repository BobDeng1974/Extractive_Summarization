@entity9 and @entity10 were ordered out of their property in @entity13 in @entity14 , northwest @entity15 , after council workers were left staggered at the mess - which reached from floor to ceiling in most rooms			1
the couple were told not to return for three months so the council could clear the rubbish up and fumigate the house			2
disgusting : @entity10 and @entity25 kept 65 cats at their home in @entity14 @entity27 was made aware of the situation by neighbours more than two years ago after they complained of a ‘ putrid smell ’ , and after a protracted battle with the couple they finally managed to get them out of the house last week			1
the council , who will have to remove 30 tons of rubbish from the house between now and august , have successfully won an asbo against the couple banning them from keeping or feeding cats			1
sergeant @entity44 said : ' it was only when taking statements from the neighbours that we realised what a devastating effect the @entity50 where having on their everyday lives			0
unbelievable : @entity14 council will have to remove 30 tonnes of rubbish from the @entity10 's home between now and august shocking : bin bags were found piled up to the ceiling and empty cans of cat food littered the floor ' i could appreciate at first hand the smell and whilst serving the order i have never come across a property so hazardous to health			1
' cllr @entity66 , of @entity27 , said he was pushing to get the couple to pay the clean up costs , adding : ' everyone has the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their home , whether it is privately or socially owned			2
' the @entity10 ’s family way of life infringed on their neighbour ’s rights , health and wellbeing , so partners worked together to enforce a @entity83 and @entity84			2
' taxpayers should not foot the bill as this family have infringed on their neighbours ’ rights , health and wellbeing			0
' @entity92 , of the @entity93 , where the 65 cats were taken to for treatment said many had to be put down as they were so ill. rotting rubbish : @entity98 first complained to the council about the @entity50 two years ago distressing : officials found the remains of three dead cats under the unbelievable levels of waste she said that council workers should ‘ expect to find more dead cats ’ in the house , adding : ' the filth that they were living in is unbelievable			2
' one neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ' the smell was truly horrendous			0
' this couple just took in more and more cats until they completely overran the place and combined with the floor - to - celing rubbish it meant you could smell the house as soon as you turned into the street			0
' a spokesman for @entity27 said this week : ' neighbours had complained about the revolting smell and distressing build up of cat faeces in their gardens and the council ’s public health team , who inspected the property on several occasions , found it was full of rotting rubbish and cat faecal matter			0
' since 2010 council environmental officers had taken a number of steps to support the tenants in clearing the property , however @entity142 and mrs @entity10 had continued to ignore notices and advice about dealing with the build up of rubbish and the welfare of the cats			1
' during the clear up , enforcement officers also discovered the decomposed remains of dead cats			0
