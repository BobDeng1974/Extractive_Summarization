it has covered over 25 miles on @entity1 , setting a new off - @entity3 driving record			1
now , however , @entity5 operators have found the @entity7 's memory is beginning to fail			1
they plan to wipe it completely in a bid to fix the bugs and restore the rover to its sprightly best			0

the rover 's memory is now failing , causing operators to begin planning to totally reset it			1
flash memory retains data even when power is off			0
it is the type used for storing photos and songs on smart phones or digital cameras , among many other uses			0
individual cells within a flash memory sector can wear out from repeated use			0
reformatting clears the memory while identifying bad cells and flagging them to be avoided			0
an increasing frequency of computer resets has prompted the rover team to make plans to reformat the rover 's flash memory			1
the resets , including a dozen this month , interfere with the rover 's planned science activities , even though recovery from each incident is completed within a day or two			1
' worn - out cells in the flash memory are the leading suspect in causing these resets , ' said @entity48 of @entity5 's @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , project manager for @entity5 's @entity53			1
' the flash reformatting is a low - risk process , as critical sequences and flight software are stored elsewhere in other non-volatile memory on the rover			2

@entity5 's other rovers have had similar problems			1
the project landed twin rovers @entity78 on @entity1 in early 2004 to begin missions planned to last only three months			1
one of @entity82 's first pics from @entity1 : on friday , 30 january 2004 , @entity5 released this image of the rover with its lander petal extended in preparation for the rover to egress from the lander			1

@entity92 worked for six years , and @entity7 is still active			0
findings about ancient wet environments on @entity1 have come from both @entity96 project reformatted the flash memory on spirit five years ago to stop a series of amnesia events @entity92 had been experiencing			1
the reformatting planned for early next month will be the first for @entity7			0
even after the rover has been active for more than a decade and is currently about 125 million miles ( about 200 million kilometers ) from @entity49 , the rover team can still perform this type of upkeep			2
earlier this month is captured the record for longest distance traveled on an extraterrestrial world since may 1973 the record for the longest distance traveled on an extraterrestrial world has been held by the @entity114 ’s @entity113 moon rover , which covered 24 miles ( 39 kilometres )			1
but that record stands no more as @entity5 ’s opportunity rover is now reported to have covered over 25 miles ( 40 km ) on @entity1 , setting a new off - @entity3 driving record			1
and in more than ten years on the surface the rover is still going strong , despite initially being planned only to travel 0.62 miles ( one kilometre )			1
' opportunity has driven farther than any other wheeled vehicle on another world , ' said @entity53 manager @entity48 , of @entity5 's @entity49 ( @entity49 ) in @entity50 , @entity51			1
@entity5 's @entity7 , illustration shown , has now traveled over 25 miles ( 40 kilometres ) on @entity1			1
the distance , which has taken 10 years , is a new record for off - @entity3 driving			0
the previous record was held by the @entity114 's @entity113 moon rover , which covered 24 miles ( 39 kilometres ) on the lunar surface on average the red planet is 141.6 million miles ( 227.9 million kilometres ) from the sun. with a diameter of 4,222 miles it ’s around half the size of @entity3			2
it ’s absolutely freezing there , with an average temperature of -65 ° c ( -85 ° f )			0
gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours			0
the atmosphere is desperately thin - one per cent of @entity3 ’s pressure - and not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide			0
it boasts the solar system ’s biggest mountain - @entity147 , a dead volcano			0
the planet 's red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface			0
@entity1 also has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps			2
if they melted , it would cover the whole planet in water 36 feet ( 11 metres ) deep , according to @entity5			2
' this is so remarkable considering @entity7 was intended to drive about one kilometer [ 0.62 miles ] and was never designed for distance			1
' but what is really important is not how many miles the rover has racked up , but how much exploration and discovery we have accomplished over that distance			2
' a drive of 157 feet ( 48 metres ) on 27 july put @entity7 's total odometry at 25.01 miles ( 40.25 kilometers )			2
this month 's driving brought the rover southward along the western rim of @entity173			2
the rover had driven more than 20 miles ( 32 km ) before arriving at @entity173 in 2011 , where it has examined outcrops on the crater ’s rim containing clay and sulfate - bearing minerals			2
the sites are yielding evidence of ancient environments with less acidic water than those examined at @entity7 ’s landing site			0
if the rover can continue to operate the distance of a marathon - 26.2 miles ( about 42.2 km ) - it will approach the next major investigation site mission scientists have dubbed ' @entity193 '			2
observations from spacecraft orbiting @entity1 suggest several clay minerals are exposed close together at this valley site , surrounded by steep slopes where the relationships among different layers may be evident			0
@entity5 's @entity7 , working on @entity1 since january 2004 , passed 25 miles of total driving on 27 july 2014			1
the gold line on this map shows @entity7 's route from the landing site inside @entity206 ( upper left ) to its location after the 27 july drive this chart provides a comparison of the distances driven by various wheeled vehicles on the surface of @entity1 and @entity3 's moon			2
of the vehicles shown , @entity5 's @entity216 and @entity217 are still active and the totals listed are distances driven as of 28 july 2014 the @entity221 @entity113 rover , model shown , landed on @entity3 's moon on 15 january 1973 , where it drove about 24.2 miles ( 39 kilometers ) in less than five months , according to calculations recently made using images from @entity5 's @entity226 ( @entity226 ) cameras that revealed its tracks ' the @entity113 missions still stand as two signature accomplishments of what i think of as the first golden age of planetary exploration , the 1960s and ' 70s , ' said @entity236 of @entity237 in @entity238 , @entity239 , and principal investigator for @entity5 's twin @entity1 rovers , @entity7 and @entity92			1
' we ’re in a second golden age now , and what we ’ve tried to do on @entity1 with @entity78 has been very much inspired by the accomplishments of the @entity113 team on the moon so many years ago			0
' it has been a real honor to follow in their historical wheel tracks			0
' as @entity7 neared the mileage record earlier this year , the rover team chose the name @entity113 2 for a crater about 20 feet ( 6 metres ) in diameter on the outer slope of @entity173 's rim on @entity1			1
the @entity53 is one element of @entity5 's ongoing and future @entity1 missions preparing for a human mission to the planet in the 2030s .			1
