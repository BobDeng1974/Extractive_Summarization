@entity1 students are renowned for their intelligence so you would think they 'd have more sense than to emulate @entity5			1
but that 's exactly what 12 undergraduates have done by volunteering to take part in a competition called ' @entity1 's @entity11 '			1
one of the entrants uses @entity5 as his muse as he replicates her infamous paper cover by wearing long black gloves , a pearl necklace and little else			1
the six male and six female contestants are vying for the title of ' @entity1 's @entity51 ' with their cheeky shots			2
each candidate appears on the student newspaper @entity54 website which encourages their peers to vote on their favourite bottom			0
the 12 finalists were chosen by @entity60 editorial team from a pool of entries			0
those in the running include @entity65 - who reads @entity66 at @entity67 - who appears posing on the roof of her college dressed in just blue stockings			0
high jinx : @entity65 took to the rooftops to strip off modest : @entity75 student @entity74 kept her pants on cow boy : @entity78 from @entity79 reading @entity80 posed in front of a confused bull @entity83 view : @entity85 also posed by the @entity44 holding an oar another girl called @entity88 , who is reading @entity38 at @entity79 , is pictured next to the river gazing at the iconic @entity90			2
each photo is accompanied by a tongue - in - the - cheek comment playing up to their brainy reputation such as : ' @entity88 supports the hypothesis that @entity96 was indeed a necrophiliac , and that the eroticism of his mutilated muse has been significantly understated in all recent scholarship â€“ or indeed in any scholarship			0
' cheeky : @entity104 from @entity105 posed on the chair of the president of the @entity108 hold the front page : @entity111 from @entity112 reading @entity110 reads a paper in her picture feminist statement : @entity116 from @entity117 holds a copy of @entity119 while baring all organisers said all the entrants had ' volunteered ' their services and both male and female students were participating in the same competition			1
while reality star @entity5 has put bottoms firmly in the spotlight recently , the @entity1 students can actually lay claim to starting the trend			2
this is the third time they have run their controversial competition - which has received opposition from women 's groups and has been forced to change its name			1
it was originally dubbed ' @entity139 ' , but had to change the title last year after being contacted by the annual competition who claimed they had stolen their name			1
bottoms up : @entity145 from @entity146 reading @entity66 on the steps of the college chapel previous winners of the official @entity139 , first awarded in 1976 , include singers @entity150 and @entity152 and @entity154 's @entity153			0
this year 's winners were singer @entity156 and tv presenter @entity157 who won the gong for the second time			0
the @entity1 declined to comment on the ' best bums ' competition .			0

previously called ' @entity139 '
had to change name following *complaint*
12 students - six male , six female - posed from behind to enter
