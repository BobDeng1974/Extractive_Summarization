a big weekend of derbies in the @entity1 sees @entity3 travel to @entity4 and @entity5 face @entity6			1
at @entity7 , @entity5 will look to continue their impressive run of form , while the race for fourth hots up at @entity11			1
to celebrate , @entity13 's experts cast their minds back to decide the best derby matches they 've ever seen ... @entity16 @entity4 0 - 5 @entity3 , december 1978 as a fan i loved watching @entity3 beat @entity4 5 - 0 in 1978 , with @entity19 scoring that fabulous goal			1
he bent it in the corner and as a young kid that was a classic game			0
in terms of playing , the most memorable derby i played in was the @entity28 semi-final at @entity30 in 2001			1
it was @entity32 ’s last game for @entity4 before he moved to @entity3 and it was great to beat our old rivals			1
@entity3 's @entity36 celebrates with his team - mates in the @entity39 ' 5 - 0 drubbing of @entity4 in 1978 @entity40 @entity42 4 - 3 @entity41 , september 2009 to borrow a line from my intro that night , until this remarkable game reached its extraordinary climax , a conversation between @entity49 and sir @entity50 about derby winners would have been limited to events on @entity53			1
@entity49 ’s winner , scored in the sixth minute of second - half stoppage time after @entity41 had equalised three times , crowned what sir @entity50 considered the greatest @entity59 derby in history			2
@entity49 ( right ) breaks past @entity61 to score the winner against @entity41 in 2009 @entity63 @entity6 2 - 3 @entity5 , april 2001 last season ’s 3 - 3 draw at @entity7 was possibly the best football match these two sides have produced in the last 20 years but it has to play second fiddle to the meeting in april 2001			1
five goals , dreadful refereeing decisions for both sides , a missed penalty ( @entity74 ) , a scored penalty ( @entity76 ) , a red card ( @entity78 ) and settled in injury time - 3 - 2 in @entity5 ’s favour - by @entity81 ’s 40 - yard free - kick			2
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity82 holds his head in his hands after @entity81 's 40 - yard free - kick @entity85 @entity87 0 - 3 @entity86 , march 2002 an extraordinarily visceral derby , with @entity87 ’s ground , the @entity90 , shaking as the teams came out			1
a 21 - year - old @entity92 opened the scoring for @entity94 with @entity95 and @entity96 securing the win			0
what was remarkable was that the entire stadium of @entity87 fans all sang continuously at deafening pitch for the final ten minutes of the game , expressing their undying love for the club despite the humiliation			0
even @entity96 ’s 88th - minute goal had no impact on them			0
a young @entity92 celebrates after scoring for @entity86 against @entity87 in 2002 @entity109 @entity6 3 - 3 @entity5 , november 2013 last season ’s @entity111 derby at @entity7 matched any classic from yesteryear			1
@entity6 and @entity5 were in the top five , bang in form , and reckless in their attacking ambition			2
the big names delivered - @entity119 , @entity120 ( 2 ) , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 all scored - and 3 - 3 was fair because nobody deserved to lose			0
@entity121 ( right ) celebrates with @entity125 after scoring in the @entity111 derby @entity127 @entity128 wednesday 2 - 1 @entity129 , april 1993 brilliant free - kick by @entity131 in the opening minutes sparked a memorable match , a @entity42 fight back inspired by beardy warhorse and hero @entity134 in extra time			1
it was also a fabulous spectacle created by fans from a city where football means so much but where glory days are few			0
with so much at stake the atmosphere was electric and it was n’t even in @entity128			0
@entity145 wheels away in celebration after scoring @entity148 's winner in extra time at @entity149 @entity150 @entity42 4 - 3 @entity41 , september 2009 @entity30 , and the noisy neighbours were just beginning to annoy the residents of @entity153			2
this was a day that @entity41 would really test @entity42 ’s mettle , refusing to lie down as , inspired by the remarkable @entity156 , @entity158 ’ team held his old club at 3 - 3 deep into added time			0
@entity42 , though , really knew how to win back then and , with seconds remaining , @entity161 played in @entity49 at the @entity163			0
in a flash , a remarkable game was won			0
@entity166 @entity6 4 - 4 @entity5 , february 1991 i was at that @entity28 replay and it was the best live game i ’ve ever watched			2
the atmosphere was unbelievable and it was a game that had everything – great drama and lots of goals including that incredible strike from @entity176			0
from my playing days , it was @entity5 beating @entity6 3 - 2 when @entity74 sniffed the ground after scoring			2
you always remember the games you win			0
@entity181 slides into a challenge during @entity5 and @entity6 's stunning 4 - 4 draw in 1991			1
