by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:17 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 16:50 est , 9 september 2013 a small @entity3 liberal arts college said monday a $ 250 million donation that was among the largest gifts to higher education in @entity8 history has been withdrawn			1
@entity9 announced that the widely reported gift , from the @entity11 , was linked to a ' significant capital market event ' , and revealed to @entity13 the gift was tied to an expected corporate reorganization that fell through			1
broken down across the school 's enrollment , the gift worked out to about $ 208,000 per student			1
it was to be used to fund scholarships and other learning initiatives			0
' this is a deep disappointment , let ’s be clear ... this is a disappointing day , ' @entity9 president @entity23 told @entity13			0
one of the largest - ever : the $ 250million , all - stock gift would have ranked in the top 20 ever given to higher education in the @entity8 though the @entity28 has not publicly disclosed the reason for going back on its eye - popping pledge , @entity32 , the school 's chief fundraiser , told @entity13 that @entity35 and @entity36 , from which the all - stock grant was going to be made , are currently in the midst of a reorganization			1
' the company was going through a corporate reorganization and recapitalization … a multi-billion dollar transaction , ' said mr @entity32			2
that transaction was to close last wednesday , which did not happen , mr @entity32 noted			0
' we learned a week ago that it did not look promising for the closing to happen on schedule , ' mr @entity32 said , adding that once finding out wednesday that the refinancing offer was withdrawn , the writing was on the wall			1
' we learned friday the grant was withdrawn , ' said mr @entity32			2
the money for the grant , according to mr @entity32 , was to come from the capital injection received while refinancing debt and other obligations			2
' typically in those situations , it allows you to take some money , ' mr @entity32 added			0
no discussions took place to perhaps work out a smaller grant			2
after going public with the planned donation , the @entity9 was all dressed up with nowhere to go			2
' it was withdrawn completely ... there will be no further discussions regarding the grant or the scholarship program , ' said mr @entity32			0
the school decided to go forward with announcing the abrupt cancellation of the @entity75 program because it had planned on beginning recruiting for the first class of beneficiaries to join the school this august , mr @entity32 noted			0
the donation was the college 's idea , mr @entity23 said , explaining that he approached the trust			1
@entity9 will continue its pursuit of creating the type of scholarship program envisioned by the gift , but is now exploring different avenues to fund such a program he added			0
despite there being no other donors readily available to fill the massive void left by the donation claw - back , ' we certainly have other people who care about the welfare of our students , ' mr @entity23 added			2
better days : @entity9 president @entity23 announcing the donation earlier this year ' we will continue to pursue the goal of such a program designed to prepare students as leaders and entrepreneurs , ' mr @entity23 said			0
' a task force of trustees , faculty , staff and students will be assembled to continue this conversation			0
' at $ 250million , the all - stock donation would have more than doubled the school 's current $ 230million endowment , according to @entity113			1
it was slated to fund 160 scholarships as part of the @entity118 , with 40 awarded each year for the next four years , @entity114 noted			0
@entity35 , a @entity119 , @entity120 - based supplier of car dealer support services , was publicly traded prior to the merger and has been on a recent acquisition spree , according to announcements on the company 's site			1
when reached by @entity13 for comment , a @entity35 spokesperson said the company is not affiliated with the @entity28 and declined further comment			0
the trust is named for the deceased father of current company president and ceo @entity133 , who once attended @entity9			1
well - known : the 2012 vice presidential debate , between @entity136 ( @entity137 ) and @entity138 ( @entity139 ) was held at @entity9 the trust has donated to @entity9 before , in 2011 with a $ 19.5million gift that was used to build new student residences , according to the school 's website			1
named @entity145 , the apartment - style dorm houses 124 upper - class student , according to the university			1
@entity150 formed the charitable trust in 1981 , a few years before his death			0
his son , @entity153 , attended @entity9 for a couple of years before getting his degree elsewhere and is a former chairman of the school 's board of trustees			1
@entity133 , who lives in @entity159 , left the @entity3 school because he wanted a degree in business administration , which is n't offered as a major at @entity9			0
generous alum : @entity153 , son the the @entity28 's namesake and former @entity9 student , may be the reason behind at least the trust 's previous donation of $ 19.5million @entity32 , @entity9 's vice president of college relations , said the @entity28 has been " a longtime friend and important partner			1
" he said the trust has made a number of generous gifts over the years to help transform the campus and improve its facilities			1
' our collaboration with the @entity28 has made us better in many ways and will continue to do so , ' he said			0
both mr @entity32 and mr @entity23 were quick to point out the past generosity of mr @entity133 and the trust			0
mr @entity133 remains on the school 's board of trustees , they noted			0
the all - stock donation had ranked among the 20 biggest gifts ever to a @entity8 college or university , according to a list maintained by the @entity190			1
it had been the second - largest such gift to a @entity8 school since 2011 , according to the @entity194 , surpassed only by @entity196 mayor @entity114 's $ 350 million donation to @entity197 announced earlier this year			1
despite today 's bad news , mr @entity23 sounded a positive note for the small school 's future			2
' @entity9 was an outstanding national liberal arts college before the gift was committed , and @entity9 's future remains exceedingly bright , ' mr @entity23 said .			2

the donation , to be made by the @entity11 , ranked in the top 20 gifts ever given to a @entity8 college or university
@entity153 , son of the trust 's namesake , and ceo of the company whose stock was to be donated , once attended the college
it would have been the second - largest such gift since 2011 , and would have *equated* to about $ 208,000 per student at the small college
the grant would have been all - stock , no cash was involved , and was to have come from leftover *equity* after a refinancing offer that fell through
