by @entity0 a troupe of circus performers has been denied a business account after bank bosses branded their burlesque costumes - a ' moral problem ' - even though they 've got a no nudity policy			1
entertainer @entity8 started ‘ @entity14 ’ earlier this year and applied for a business bank account with @entity10 so he could get grants to fund work with terminally - ill children			1
but he claims the banking giant denied his troupe an account because the showgirls ’ burlesque - style outfits - a fringed bikini and stilts - were a ' moral problem '			1
mr @entity8 , an acrobat and juggler from @entity24 , said : ' it has put all our plans on hold - we ca n’t move forward without it			2
' the 20 - year - old said the company needed the account so they could apply for grants to run a program that would bring the favourite cartoon characters of terminally ill children in to see them			1
mr @entity8 said his performers were far from x-rated			0
he said : ' we never offer anything that could cause upset			0
there is no nudity or anything like that			0
burlesque - style shows are pretty mainstream now			2
the @entity66 branch of @entity10 in @entity24 which prevented the troupe from opening an account ' i have spoken to friends in the circus industry and other burlesque acts too , and none of them have ever had an issue with a bank			1
' mr @entity8 ' problems began after he went into @entity24 's @entity66 branch of @entity10 and was questioned about his business , ' which seemed absolutely fine '			2
a week later he claims he was told on the phone he could n’t bank with @entity10 because staff had looked on the circus ’ website and did n’t like the look of costumes worn during some acts			1
mr @entity8 said : ' she said we had been denied a bank account on the ground that we have a burlesque and a show girls act			0
the troupe have performed at @entity39 and were a centre piece at the @entity40 ' she said someone higher up than her said because we sell burlesque and show girls acts we ca n’t have an account			2
' she kept saying it was a ‘ moral problem ’ and that it was a ‘ moral problem ’ they ca n’t associate with the bank			0
' we asked why that meant we could n’t have an account and they did n’t offer an explanation , they just said no. ' the outfit in question is a blue fringed bikini covered in jewels , worn with a feather boa and a headdress by female show girls who greet audiences before performing a burlesque act			0
mr @entity8 said he could n't understand why a bank was making a moral judgement , as his troupe were booked for a @entity121 party in september			0
a @entity10 spokesman would not comment on the reason why mr @entity8 ' was not allowed to open an account , but said it was ' happy to review ' his application following some ' clarification of the nature of the business '			1
the spokesman said it was still in discussions with mr @entity8 and hoped to reach a ' positive outcome ' in the coming days			0
he said : ' we are very sorry for any concern or inconvenience that out initial misunderstanding may have caused			1

troupe wanted account so they could put on shows for terminally - ill children
@entity10 turned them down down after seeing costumes on their website
but now claims it had an ' initial misunderstanding ' and is trying to *resolve* it
