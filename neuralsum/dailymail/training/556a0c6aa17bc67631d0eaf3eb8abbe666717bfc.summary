when @entity1 and @entity2 were woken by the sound of workmen digging holes outside their home , it was little more than an everyday suburban irritation			1
this soon turned to alarm , however , when concrete posts were put into the holes and a six - foot timber fence erected across the front and side of the house they have lived in for 26 years			2
‘ it feels like we are behind some kind of @entity20 , like being a prisoner in our own home , ’ said mrs @entity2			1
@entity2 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , has been left unable to use her garden gate after her neighbour built a fence across it the move comes after a row with the property developer over the state of mrs @entity2 's garden wall mrs @entity2 and her husband looked on in horror as builders erected the wooden fence around their @entity39 four - bedroom property last week the fence was the culmination of a dispute the family have been having with the property company that owns the apartments next door , which says they had encroached on its land			1
it means the @entity50 can no longer use the front gate of their four - bedroom house , which can only be reached from the rear , while the fence is all they can see out of their living - room window			2
mrs @entity2 , 62 , a retired teacher , said : ‘ the first we knew that a fence was going up was when the builders arrived on friday			2
they refused to stop , so i called the police and the council , who sent an enforcement officer			0
‘ but he said planning permission was n’t needed and dismissed it as a neighbour dispute			0
now we have been barricaded in			0
’ the couple 's @entity70 worth £ 2,000 , has also been blocked in by the fence , which has been erected around their property an aerial shot of mrs @entity2 house , marked up to show exactly where the fence erected around the house has been built neighbouring property developer @entity78 , left , who had the fence put up around the property by workmen , right the fence has been built on land owned @entity83 which own 12 apartments overlooking the @entity87 ' home the fence was put 8in from her front gate on the perimeter of a car park owned by @entity83 , a property firm formed by the 12 owners of apartments in a converted flour mill adjacent to the @entity50 ’ home in @entity23 , @entity24			1
mr @entity87 , 60 , an engineer , his wife and three children moved there in 1988 , a few years after the conversion was completed			0
the property has a rear driveway , but the family began paying @entity83 a nominal rent in 2012 to park two cars in its parking area in front of their home			0
mrs @entity2 , pictured standing outside her home , said : ' this is a @entity39 house , it was built in 1865 , it 's never going to be a show home ' mrs @entity2 said they can still get in and out via the back door but are unable to leave and enter their home through the front the developer who owns flats next door to the property said the wall was devaluing the price of his properties mr @entity78 said he put up the fence to keep it out of sight from potential buyers mrs @entity2 said the two sides fell out after a car crashed through her garden ’s brick wall , partially demolishing it			1
she used the access it created to park her @entity70 on the front lawn , where it is now stuck			0
@entity137 asked the family to tidy up the front of their home and even offered to pay for replacing the wall if the couple agreed to sign over ownership of it			1
mrs @entity2 said the company warned it would build a new boundary fence if she did not rectify the damage , but heard no more about it until last friday			2
mrs @entity2 says she now has to use a ladder to exit her home on the side of the new fence the move , which followed a row over their crumbling garden fence , means they can no longer walk out of the front gate or move their car off the drive @entity78 , 57 , a @entity83 resident and director of the property management company , claimed the couple demolished part of the wall themselves to create access to an extra parking space for a third car , and said the state of the @entity50 ’ garden was hitting the value of the apartments			1
he added : ‘ it was unsightly and also trespassing on our land			0
‘ we have tried to be amicable and neighbourly , but @entity78 and mrs @entity2 would accept no compromise			1
’ @entity180 council said : ‘ the fence was erected under permitted development rights			0
the local planning authority can not intervene			0
’ the developer insists he has been reasonable with the couple , who he says have ' accepted no compromise ' mrs @entity2 said : ' we 're like prisoners in our own home , we 've been barricaded in			1
it feels like we are behind some kind of @entity20 ' the couple are also unable to receive their post due to their house being surrounded by the fence			0

couple had row with neighbour after he claimed state of their old wall was *reducing* values of neighbouring homes
developer @entity78 erected fence to *screen* the wall which now blocks the couple 's gate and garden
@entity2 and @entity87 say they have been ' barricaded in their own home ' and need ladder to leave
developer says he offered couple a compromise but they refused : ' we were forced to take the action we did '
