millions of people around the world are to be offered the chance of immortality on the moon			2
a multi-million pound scheme is hoping to fund a private lunar mission within the next decade , and for less than £ 64 ( $ 100 ) each , members of the public will be invited to buy space on memory discs , and , for an undisclosed price , send a sample of their hair			1
these discs will act like time capsules for photos , videos and other files , and will be buried in a bore hole drilled into the lunar surface			2
it was devised by @entity29 engineer and financier @entity30			1
called @entity31 the crowd - funded spacecraft will fly to the @entity34 where there is constant sunlight ( illustration shown ) four billion - year - old material extracted from the hole - which could be up to 330 feet ( 100 metres ) deep - will then be studied for scientific purposes			1
the mission is called @entity31 , and will involve sending a craft to the moon 's @entity34 - where there is constant sunlight			1
the vehicle will be delivered into space by a medium - lift rocket , such as @entity49 ’s @entity48 , before embarking on its journey to the moon			2
once there , it will carry out a descent sequence to the lunar surface , with four engines ensuring it lands gently within a pre-determined landing site the size of a football stadium			0
on the surface it will drill to depths of up to 330 feet ( 100 metres ) , collecting samples every six inches ( 15cm ) for analysis on board the spacecraft			1
it ’s thought that the top 33 feet ( 10 metres ) or so of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles			2
further down , though , the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago			0
once on the moon the spacecraft will drill 100 metres ( 330 feet ) down to collect samples for scientific analysis ( illustrated )			1
it will collect samples every six inches ( 15cm ) , which will be scooped up and placed in the spacecraft for scientific analysis to answer questions about the moon inside the hole ( illustrated ) will be placed archived data from the public on @entity91			1
people can buy a space on the memory discs for £ 64 ( $ 100 )			1
the team are seeking funding now and hope to launch in 2024 among the scientific questions hoping to be answered , @entity31 wants to discover the true origins of the moon			1
and , at the bottom of the hole , astronauts will place the discs containing the archived data from the public back on @entity91			1
@entity29 engineer and city financier @entity30 , who came up with the plan said : ' people can put any information they like in the memory disc ; it will be like a personal time capsule , a private archive			1
it could be a small message saying " hi , i 'm @entity118 " or a whole family history			0
' we have carried out research and been quite surprised how keen people are			0
school kids think the idea of having a bit of themselves on the moon is fantastic			0
' the samples of varying depths will be analysed on board the spacecraft inside special capsules ( illustrated )			2
it ’s thought that the top 33 feet ( 10 metres ) or so of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles , while further down will be rock fused by heat he added : ' governments are finding it increasingly difficult to fund space exploration that is solely for the advancement of human knowledge and understanding as opposed to commercial return			1
' the world class team of advisers and supporters we have assembled will address this issue and crucially anyone from around the world can get involved for as little as a few pounds			0
' under the scheme , there will be hundreds of discs , each one about two inches ( 5cm ) in diameter			0
the company plans to send a robot lander to the @entity34 of the moon - an unexplored area			1
they will drill to a depth of at least 66 feet ( 20 metres ) - 10 times deeper than has been drilled before - and potentially up to 330 feet ( 100 metres )			1
the hole will be two inches ( 5cm ) in diameter , and it will take the lander one hour to drill each six inches ( 15cm )			0
core samples will taken from each six inches			0
it will then study lunar rock from this depth that is 4.5 billion years old , and has remain untouched underground			0
it ’s thought the top 33 feet ( 10 metres ) or so of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles			2
further down , though , the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago			0
among the scientific questions hoping to be answered , @entity31 wants to discover the true origins of the moon			2
the spacecraft will be delivered into space by a medium - lift rocket such as @entity49 ’s @entity48			2
it will carry out a staged descent sequent to the lunar surface			0
four main engines will ensure it lands gently on the surface and keep it within a landing site the size of a football stadium			0
the spacecraft will be equipped not only with a drill , but also a jointed robotic arm to extract segments from its core , and other instruments to analyse core samples and monitor seismic @entity207 solar cells will power the lander			2
people helping to fund the mission will be promised a small part of a disc on which to load information			2
an initial development phase has been launched via @entity215			0
individuals making pledges through @entity215 will become lifetime members of the @entity219 and given access to information and experiences related to the mission			0
they will also be offered the chance of seeing their name inscribed on the lunar lander that will carry the drill and memory discs to the moon			1
various celebrities have endorsed the mission in a promotional video including professor @entity232 ( pictured )			1
‘ if we ’re going to explore space , and i think we have to , then the moon is the obvious stepping stone , ’ said professor @entity232			1
‘ it ’s the easiest place to land and build a base			0
’ @entity29 engineer and @entity30 , who came up with the plan ( illustrated ) said : ' we have carried out research and been quite surprised how keen people are			1
school kids think the idea of having a bit of themselves on the moon is fantastic ' the spacecraft will be delivered into space by a medium - lift rocket such as @entity49 ’s @entity48 , pictured launching in july this year from @entity252 in the @entity253 the plan is to land on the @entity34 , a favoured spot for future moon bases because it receives constant sunshine			1
rock drilled out of the lunar crust could be analysed in situ , using a package of scientific instruments , or left behind for human moon explorers in years to come			0
mr @entity30 said business plan projections had shown that the global sale of memory disc space could raise enough to pay for the mission with money to spare			1
' we 're looking to make billions in revenue , ' he said			0
' it will be well in excess of the mission costs			0
' a commercial rocket such as the @entity48 9 , from private space transport pioneers @entity49 , could be used to send the discs to the moon , confirmed mr @entity30			1
his team has taken advice from @entity280 , part of the @entity282 in @entity283 , @entity284 , which contributed to @entity286 's recent comet probe , @entity287			0
@entity287 hit the headlines by making a dramatic landing on a comet more than 300 million miles ( 480 million km ) from @entity91 last week			0
professor @entity291 , director of @entity280 , said : ' @entity31 is both ambitious and innovative , demonstrating an exciting way of enabling lunar exploration			2
our experience in multiple and complex space missions will play a vital role in helping co-ordinate the project			0
