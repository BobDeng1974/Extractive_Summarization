it 's the website that is allowing people to rest easy by pinpointing which houses were the site of an @entity6 horror story			1
one year in the making , @entity7 is a new means of finding out if someone died in your home			1
ceo @entity13 said he was inspired to create the site after a tenant renting a property of his in @entity18 , @entity19 , informed him the place was inhabited by ghosts			0
under the impression there were laws in place to disclose a death in a residence , @entity13 was shocked to find there were n't any			2
predominant @entity6 state laws only require the disclosure of violent deaths			0
while the site is benefitting those who have long held the belief their house was haunted by pulling up relevant historical information , it is proving even more advantageous to homeowners or potential buyers			2
freaky : a new website is helping people - and putting off real estate agents - by providing information on whether someone has died inside a residence it 's much harder to sell a house at a premium price when a buyer knows something grisly has unfolded inside			1
' it occurred to me that a service which told people who died in their homes before they moved in would be popular , ' @entity13 told the @entity57			2
' it 's harder to find things like this out than you think			0
' @entity63 , for example , is a non-disclosure state			2
' per the @entity67 ’s disclosure form it is not a requirement to disclose a non-violent death that occurred on the property , ' said @entity72 real estate agent @entity71			1
' however , a violent death — like a murder — must be disclosed			0
' according to @entity13 , since sending the site live on june 1 , he has had the most hits from people in @entity63 and @entity79			1
@entity79 residents , he says , are interested in the many famous murders and deaths in the state and the possibility that one may be linked to their house			2
it costs $ 11.99 to submit a request			0
once a user logs on and enters an address , @entity13 and his team of staff search through a multitude of sources to deliver information on previous owners and whether or not anyone met their demise inside the residence			2
the site : @entity100 claims to have processed thousands of requests since launching on june 1			1
many of the submissions are from either @entity63 or @entity79 some realtors are actively against @entity7 because it costs them money on what is known as ' stigmatized ' properties			1
however @entity13 maintains he is providing a legitimate public service			0
one case might have been the story of @entity112 , who moved to @entity113 with her two children from @entity79 following the death of her husband			2
she bought a house for $ 610,000 but would later find out it was the site of a recent murder - suicide			1
still trying to deal with her own tragedy , @entity120 was faced with also dealing with the people who would come by to gawk at her new home			0
@entity112 sued for fraud and misrepresentation , claiming the owners and real estate agents duped her			1
however the judge ruled against her , saying @entity113 state law does not require agents to disclose such events to buyers			0
she ’s since appealed to the state @entity134			0
contentious : widow @entity112 lost out in court in her attempt to prove she was duped into buying this @entity113 house			1
mrs @entity112 bought the home after her husband died and was not told it was the site of a murder - suicide less than two years earlier			1
while still trying to deal with her own tragedy she was faced with people coming by the property to gawk the stigma of a death in a home , especially a violent killing , is a powerful one , especially for families			0
' it would bother me if i knew someone died in my house , ' @entity13 said			0
' for instance , i could n’t live in a house where there was a murder - suicide			1
' a quiet death , @entity13 says , would be easier for some to deal with thousands of requests have been serviced since the site 's launch , @entity13 said			1
even realtors are using the site to better familiarize themselves with a client 's property			0
' some people do n’t have a problem with knowing someone died in their home , ' says @entity13			0
' but when you remind them that this knowledge could affect their home values , they change their tune			0

@entity7 uses a multitude of sources to tell users whether anyone has died in their house
thousands of requests have been submitted since its launch on june 1 , with @entity63 and @entity79 proving the most popular states
website has *maligned* real estate agents , who say it affects *business*
follows *landmark* case in which widow failed to prove she was duped when owners did n't disclose her new house was the site of a murder - suicide
