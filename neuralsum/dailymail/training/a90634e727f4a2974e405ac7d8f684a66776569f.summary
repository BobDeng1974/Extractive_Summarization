by @entity0 despite the rhetoric about moving on too fast from a previous lover , a new study has found those who do move on quickly are emotionally better - off			1
the study by researchers at @entity7 and the @entity8 discovered people who entered into a rebound relationship , defined as a relationship where the individual still has romantic attachments to their ex-partner , are happier and have healthier relationships			1
the findings also show people in new relationships were more confident and felt more attractive than those left trying to get over the heartbreak alone			0
get over it : a study by psychologists proves wallowing in a blur of @entity25 and @entity26 like the fictional character @entity27 after a break - up is not the answer			0
people should instead move - on into a rebound relationship it has been previously thought to be healthier to not enter into a new relationship while still harbouring feelings for an ex , but the study effectively proves rebound relationships may be more psychologically beneficial than typically thought			1
the study also proved that the quicker people move - on , not only are they personally happier , but they can also have happier relationships			2
very little psychological research has been carried out into the benefits of moving on quickly before , but in the two studies carried out by both universities , the people who had moved - on quickly were ‘ more confident in their desirability and had more resolution over their ex-partner ’			1
the study assessed the people ’s well - being , their feelings about their ex-partner , and whether they were seeing someone new			1
despite the odds a rebound relationship really can be the best way to mend a broken heart and go on to have a happier , healthier relationship , much like the eventual storyline in the rebound @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , said : ‘ a “ rebound relationship ” is commonly understood as a relationship that is initiated shortly after a romantic breakup — before the feelings about the former relationship have been resolved			2
‘ little research has examined the consequences of quickly beginning new romantic relationships after another has ended			0
in two studies we examined people who experienced a breakup and assessed their well - being , their feelings about their ex-partner , and whether they were seeing someone new			2
‘ @entity78 indicated that people in new relationships were more confident in their desirability and had more resolution over their ex-partner			0
‘ among those in new relationships , the speed with which they began their relationship was associated with greater psychological and relational health			0
overall , these findings suggest that rebound relationships may be more beneficial than typically believed			0

@entity8 and @entity7 study on rebounds
study found moving on quickly improved emotional state and relationship
researchers defined rebound as still having feelings for an ex partner
people who moved - on felt better about themselves and ' got over it ' faster
