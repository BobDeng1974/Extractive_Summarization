by @entity0 the perfectly - preserved remains of a sandwich have been found inside a church organ 118 years after being left there by workmen			1
slices of crusty bread were found wrapped in a paper bag , which was sealed within the instrument when it was built in 1896			1

the package was preserved in the inner workings of the organ , within a soundproofed area sealed with wood , which also seems to have protected the meal from the elements			2
it was stashed away with pages from the @entity21 , the newspaper from the area where the organ was built			1
her husband @entity38 , the church property steward said : ' the bread has been perfectly preserved			0
it must have been the remains of a lunch for the organ - fitters who i imagine sat down for a butty break			0
' i can just picture them sat reading the paper with their sandwich and perhaps a large hunk of cheese			0
they were found in the swell box of the organ when we took the inner layer out			2
find : the organ had stood in the @entity27 in @entity18 , @entity28 , for decades remains : the organ , built in 1896 , was sold for parts to @entity63 buyers - pictured is what remains of it today old - time religion : the above picture shows the organ as it would have been during the church 's heyday ' it was full of wooden shavings which gave out a beautiful smell of pine alongside this wonderful snapshot of history			1

innards : the remnants were found inside the organ in a part sealed by thick wood to make it soundproof ' we hope to display the newspaper cuttings but we suspect that the bread will perish now its been removed from inside the organ			1
' ' inside part of the organ there 's a huge empty box which is like a huge void			0
it has to be completely sealed to stop the sound from leaking out so it 's covered by what i call @entity105 plywood , which is like a thin skin of wood			0
