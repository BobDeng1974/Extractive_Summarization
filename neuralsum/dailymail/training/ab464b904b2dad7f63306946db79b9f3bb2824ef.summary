by @entity0 published : 04:41 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 07:52 est , 20 march 2013 fans of veteran heavy metal band @entity2 are used to seeing their idols bring the house down			1
but it was their reputation for ear - shattering sets which led to a gig being cancelled this week			0
the band were due to take part in a special one - off performance alongside ceramic artist @entity12 at @entity14 's @entity13 in @entity15			1
a limited number of fans had been given free tickets for the show in @entity41 of the @entity42 on friday			0
but earlier this week , museum bosses were forced to pull the plug on the event amid fears that not only would the ceramic tiles explode , the building could come down with it			1
a statement on the @entity13 's website reads : ' it is with regret that we have taken the decision to cancel the one - off @entity2 performance in collaboration with our ceramic artist in residence @entity12			1
' this was due to take place in the @entity62 which are currently being refurbished and a further safety inspection has revealed concerns that the high level of decibels generated by the concert would damage the historic fabric of the building			2
' the @entity13 is committed to an exciting programme of exhibitions and events but the safety of our visitors and building remains our priority at all times			2
' historic : ceramic specialist @entity12 has been an artist in resident at the @entity13 since last october worried : museum bosses had concerns that the loud decibels could damage some of the ancient artifacts ( pictured is the @entity83 ) @entity23 ' @entity84 , the lead singer of @entity2 , told @entity85 he was disappointed but not entirely surprised			1
' they had been making noises			2
they started asking the sound guy fairly nervously : " what will the volume be like ? " he was like , " what can i tell you ? they make a lot of noise " , ' he said			1
he added there were specific concerns about a hanging sculpture near to the stage			0
the museum 's worries were unlikely to have been alleviated by mr @entity23 's influences			2
' some of my favourite bands go out to make enough noise to make people physically sick			0
they use sound as a weapon , ' he told @entity85			0
' we were ready for things to go awry , ' he added			1
' apparently there was some suspended china thing around the stage			0
obviously if we cranked [ the music ] out and it detached from the ceiling , that would be embarrassing			0
' the band , who released debut album ' scum ' in 1987 , are regarded as pioneers of the ' grindcore ' scene and one of the loudest performers in the music industry .			0
