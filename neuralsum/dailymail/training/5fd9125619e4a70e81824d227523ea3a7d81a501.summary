by @entity0 published : 03:19 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 6 august 2013 ' loveable rogue ' : @entity2 pictured leaving the the @entity3 in @entity4 in 2007 , when he was jailed for six years on the face of it , he ran a tiny printer ’s shop , apparently producing nothing more exciting than menus for @entity12 restaurants			1
behind the scenes , however , @entity2 was a master forger at the centre of a major counterfeiting operation with the power to threaten @entity19 ’s economic stability			1
nicknamed ‘ @entity20 ’ , @entity2 relied on just a few simple tools – a pair of spectacles , a magnifying glass and an engraving pen – to produce the detailing on fake banknotes so authentic that by the time he was caught nearly £ 700,000 worth were in circulation			1
yet , despite his fabled ability to conjure up dodgy currency , @entity2 , whose death from lung cancer at the age of 63 was reported yesterday , could scarcely be said to have cashed in on his dubious talents			2
police sources say he appeared to have barely two pennies to rub together at his death and , in the greatest of ironies , the illness which killed him is believed to have been caused by a lifetime spent inhaling toxic printing fumes			2
a family friend said : ‘ @entity20 was a lovable rogue but one of the biggest names in crime			1
‘ it ’s a bit ironic he got lung cancer from printing – the job where he made his name as the forgery master			0
there will be a big turnout at his funeral			1
’ @entity2 , who died at his home in @entity57 on friday , was jailed for six years and four months in 2007 after he was unmasked as the ringleader of a professional gang which had the capacity to pump out £ 2million worth of fake notes a day			1
his tiny shop , @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , at @entity65 , @entity57 , appeared to offer small - scale printing , mainly menus for @entity12 restaurants			2
but its proximity to the @entity70 allied to the forger ’s peerless skills with holograms made it attractive to criminals from all over the @entity19			2
handiwork : @entity2 's dubious services were much sought after the length and breadth of the @entity19 @entity81 pickings : at his height @entity2 was churning out up to £ 2million in forged notes a day police became interested in the shop after a tip - off from the @entity84 that an unusually large number of fake @entity88 £ 20 notes were in circulation in @entity91			1
@entity2 , who became the number one target of @entity94 launched in october 2005 , was already on the police ’s radar			1
convicted : this picture , taken in 1998 when @entity2 was aged 48 , was at his trial for forgery which landed him a 10 - year stretch , although this was later overturned in 1998 , he and sidekick @entity102 were sentenced to ten years in prison for an earlier plot to flood the market with £ 1.6million of fake notes via unwitting @entity64 fans attending the @entity109 football championships in @entity110			1
in 2000 , however , both were freed on appeal and had their convictions quashed on a technicality – ironically related to a misprint on a warrant			0
in 2007 , they were not so lucky			0
when detectives from the @entity118 ( @entity118 ) raided @entity119 , @entity102 was caught red - handed printing £ 500,000 in @entity88 £ 20 notes			1
the gang also had in their possession € 500,000 ( £ 350,000 ) in forged notes			0
following the raid , another £ 672,880 worth of counterfeit notes was recovered from the banking system , although one police source said at the time : ‘ some of @entity20 ’s money is still out there			1
if i gave you one of his notes , you would n’t know it			0
’ detectives also found templates for other forgeries including passports , driving licences , id cards , bank statements , utility bills , @entity146 certificates , postage and saving stamps and tv licences			0
a photograph of judge @entity151 , who had freed @entity2 and @entity102 on appeal seven years earlier , adorned the wall of the print room , below which was scrawled : ‘ go on yersel big man ’			1
at the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity2 admitted delivering , selling and disposing of fake money between october 2006 and january 2007			1
five other gang members were also jailed for a total of 16 years			0
@entity2 ’s defence counsel said that he turned to drink after losing two sons , one aged two , and the other aged 22 after a drugs overdose			2
he had also run up debts and a previous business collapsed owing £ 15,000			0
to make ends meet , he offered to help organised gangs			0
gangs : the proximity of @entity168 's dodgy business near the @entity70 made it an attractive proposition with criminal gangs all over the country yet , as the gangs profited , @entity2 had no assets worth seizing at the time of his arrest			2
all officers could find was a battered old @entity177 , while his flat in @entity57 ’s @entity180 area was mortgaged to the hilt			0
one @entity118 source said : ‘ we expected to see him drinking champagne or going to lap dancing bars			0
but the only place he went was the pub or to buy messages			0
’ @entity189 justice spokesman @entity188 , who was director of the @entity118 when @entity2 was caught , said the former print union official ‘ had the touch of the geek about him ’ , but added : ‘ people think it ’s a bit of a wheeze , a b movie , producing banknotes in your kitchen , but in actual fact what we have is something that enables criminal gangs to profit			1
‘ this counterfeiting gang had the ability to destabilise the @entity19 economy			0
’ @entity2 ’s funeral is due to take place tomorrow at @entity210 , @entity57			2
last night , his partner @entity211 was too upset to comment			0
cover : to the outside it looked like a small printing firm specialising in @entity12 menus , but on the inside it was churning out forged bank notes , passports and @entity146 documents			0
