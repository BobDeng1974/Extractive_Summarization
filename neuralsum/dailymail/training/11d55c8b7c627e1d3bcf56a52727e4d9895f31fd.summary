by @entity0 published : 06:11 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 03:38 est , 20 march 2012 a father has spoken out about a cruel condition that has robbed his daughter of her ability to walk and talk , after scientists made a breakthrough that could lead to a cure			1
@entity10 's daughter @entity11 was born in july 2009 and by the time she was one had learned to crawl and say a few words and was poised to start walking			1
@entity11 had learned how to pull herself upright when she was one ( left ) but then her development started to regress and she stopped speaking and trying to walk ( right ) ' she was like any other little girl , ' mr @entity10 , 36 , said			1
' she was hitting all her milestones and crawling around making a nuisance of herself pulling things off surfaces			1
' but then @entity11 's development faltered before going into reverse			1
@entity10 and wife @entity26 , 36 , could only watch as she became confused and withdrawn			2
she stopped crawling and suffered from terrible headaches and muscular pain			2
' we were told not to worry at first but i could see she was losing lots of skills , ' mr @entity10 said			2
' the last time she said @entity36 she was 14 months old			2
she has n't spoken since			2
' ' the worst thing was when she stopped looking up and smiling at me when i came into the room			2
' @entity11 , 2 , with her mother @entity26 and older brother @entity43 on @entity44 , 2012			2
@entity11 becomes frustrated that she ca n't speak or move easily shortly after her second birthday a genetic test revealed @entity11 had @entity47 - a severe autism spectrum disorder that affects roughly one in 10,000 girls			1
it is caused by mutations in the gene @entity53 found on the x chromosome			2
while boys with the disease only survive a few weeks , most girls with the condition only start displaying symptoms after their first year			1
' girls with the condition are not brain - damaged , ' mr @entity10 , from @entity60 , said			1
' but they have a single faulty gene that condemns them to be locked inside their own bodies			2
' @entity10 with daughter @entity11 when she was developing normally while many girls with @entity70 survive into adulthood they need 24hour - care			1
there is no known cure			1
but now scientists have made a breakthrough that could combat the devastating condition using bone marrow transplants			1
' it 's such a horrible , brutal condition so the fact there could be a potential treatment fills us with a mixture of hope and elation , ' mr @entity10 said			2
scientists from the @entity87 in @entity88 , speculated that the brain - dwelling immune cells called microglia are defective in those with the syndrome			1
to test this theory they treated @entity47 mice with radiation to kill off their existing brain immune cells , before injecting them with healthy bone marrow cells to boost their immune systems			1
male @entity47 mice , with no working copy of @entity53 , typically die within two months , but the ones that received bone marrow from healthy mice lived up to a year , according to study author @entity105			1
@entity47 is a debilitating autism disorder which most often strikes previously healthy little girls just after they have learned to walk and say a few words and begins to drag their development @entity109 lose acquired skills , normal movement and speech			1
they are left unable to communicate or use their hands to hold , carry or manipulate objects			0
eventually they are locked into their own bodies			0
they can suffer from extreme anxiety , disordered breathing and seizures			0
scoliosis - curving of the spine - is common			0
most survive into adulthood but need 24hour care			0
there are no real treatments and no current cure			1
however , in 2007 scientists first showed they could reverse some of the symptoms in mice by stimulating the healthy copy of the @entity53 gene			1
the latest research published in @entity137 in 2012 showed success by treating the brain - dwelling immune cells called microglia			0
for more information visit @entity142 the treated mice breathed easier , walked better and gained more weight compared with untreated mice			0
female mice with just one working copy of @entity53 develop @entity47 symptoms later than male mice , but a bone - marrow transplant improved gait , breathing and weight gain for them , too			1
' if we show the immune system is playing a very important role in @entity47 patients and we could replace it in a safe way , we may develop some feasible therapies in the future , ' dr @entity105 told nature.com			1
clinical trials of bone - marrow transplants may be worth trying and drugs that improve microglia function are both in the pipeline			0
' we know it 's not a cure but at last we can see a path for clinical treatment , ' mr @entity10 said			1
' @entity11 's future is so bleak and we would do anything if it would help her			0
' he said his daughter today is generally happy but becomes frustrated because she ca n't communicate easily or play with her toys			0
she has started crawling slowly after undergoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy and uses her eyes to point at things , but mr @entity10 says these small victories do n't blind them to the fact @entity11 will deteriorate			0
' @entity11 is a real fighter			0
every day she is trying so hard , ' he said			0
' her older brother , @entity43 , is four and he asks us every day when @entity11 is going to walk and talk			0
he is so caring and understands something is ' squeezing her brain			0
' ' but now he wants to know why she is so ill and we say it 's just very bad luck			0
there 's nothing else we can say			0
' the @entity196 study has been published in @entity197			0
it was funded by @entity200 @entity199			0
the charity receives no government or lottery funding and relies on private donations to continue its research			0

@entity47 affects one in 10,000 girls . they typically show symptoms after their first birthday
it is the most physically disabling form of autism , but scientists believe they are close to finding a cure
