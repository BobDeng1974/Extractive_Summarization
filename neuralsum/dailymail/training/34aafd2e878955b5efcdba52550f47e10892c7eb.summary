i knew i would n’t have that difficulty because i had excellent lungs			0
in a video recorded before her death in 2009 , ms @entity5 said : ' ‘ i often wonder in retrospect how my parents felt when i became ill – they just buried their only son [ when this happened to me ]			2
@entity5 had just lost her brother @entity27 ( right ) to polio when she too contracted the disease			2
it left her paralysed at the age of 11 @entity5 with her mother			1
after she survived polio , doctors said she would only live a year and sent her home ‘ it was assumed by people in general and me too that both of my parents would outlive me			0
doctors said i would live a year , at most , but here i am a long time later [ thanks to the iron lung ]			1
those who have written about her life say her curiosity and desire to live as normal life as possible were the key to her longevity			0
despite her being in a situation most people would consider horrific , ms @entity5 , who was born in 1937 and lived in @entity75 , @entity76 , graduated from high school with the highest hours and hosted dinner parties			2

she cared for her for 25 years before her death in 2009			0
ms @entity5 lay horizontal the 7 - foot - long , 800 - pound iron cylinder that encased all but her head the machine takes over from my diaphragm like a big bag of air			1
‘ there are other methods of ventilation , but i have chosen not to do that			0
’ despite being permanently horizontal , she chose to remain in the machine , as she says it gave her freedom			0
the iron lung let her breathe without tubes or incisions in her throat , or the need for hospital stays			1
it also let her remain at home , living with the help of two @entity124 when her mother ’s health deteriorated in the years before her own death , ms @entity5 insisted she stayed at home , and ran the household from the iron lung			1

' at first the image and sound of the iron lung were distracting if not shocking , but soon after talking with @entity5 , the massive , metal cylinder became inconsequential because it was so greatly exceeded by her spirit			1
' she told me that she survived for so many years – while so many others with the same disease died – because of the exceptional care she received from her parents and community , and because she has always been driven to learn			0
