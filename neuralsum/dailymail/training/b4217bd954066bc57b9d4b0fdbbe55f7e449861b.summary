by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 10:34 est , 4 july 2013 a bungling council has fixed litter bins so high up lamp posts they are out of the reach of many people			1
some are up to six feet above the ground - leaving some frustrated people to leave their rubbish on the pavement instead			0
@entity11 said the bins can not go at normal height because they would cover up inspection panels			1
too high : @entity15 , four , needs his mother @entity16 , 42 , to lift him up to put rubbish in the new bins but they have now promised to lower them after a series of complaints			1
driver @entity23 , 54 , said : ' when i saw the first one i thought it must have been kids pushing them up , but i ’ve since seen them all over the town			0
' i ’m 6ft 1in so it ’s not a problem for me , but if you were vertically - challenged you just could n’t do it			0
' i ’ve seen people leaving their rubbish on the ground beneath them			0
' rubbish : @entity16 , 42 , who is 5ft tall , puts a bottle in one of the bins a council spokesman said : ' some of the bins are new and they ’ve been placed above the inspection panels below them			1
' there is no point in having bins people ca n’t reach , and it ’s not every bin , but clearly one bin too high is one too many			2
' they are too high for children and disabled people			0
we can not blame people for leaving litter on the floor when they can not reach the bin			0
' we have been out to inspect the bins and we are working out a way to change the fitting on the back so they can be lowered			2
' ca n't reach : @entity61 , 83 , who is a wheelchair user , is unable to reach to put rubbish in the new bins in @entity11 rubbish : @entity64 , 88 , who is 5ft 7in tall and can only just reach the new bins which are around six feet up in the air			1
