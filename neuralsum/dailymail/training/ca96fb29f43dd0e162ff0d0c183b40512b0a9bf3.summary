the @entity1 has hit the shelves and those lucky enough to have a console on launch day must decide what games are worth getting			1
whether it 's showing off the best graphics , or picking the best shooter , @entity7 runs the rule over the top launch titles			1
@entity12 : @entity13 ( best visuals ) its development has been plagued with issues - notably moving from a @entity19 - centered game to a third - person hack and slash			1
combat is extremely repetitive , enemies all look the same and game menus are bewildering			1
stunning : there is no doubting just how good @entity12 looks in parts - especially this early battle scene those issues aside , there 's still a lot of fun to be had here			1
using a more primitive version of a combat system found in the likes of @entity39 - melee revolves around countering enemy blows before unleashing various sword attacks			2
when their health is low , you can execute them in a variety of ways - ranging from severing limbs clean off , to a quick slit of the throat			1
all these are rendered in eye - popping detail thanks to the @entity53			2
graphically it 's mostly stunning			2
the early levels , in particular , will leave most in awe of the sheer scale of the battles			2
it does , however , taper off towards the end - a town - based level in particular , looks unfinished and shrouded in fog			2
level design is to be desired , too			2
you 're never really given the chance to explore the wonderfully - realized environments - rather , you 're shunted along from one battle to the next			2
it 's a shame , given that some of the most memorable parts of @entity12 's storyline are away from the monotonous combat			2
@entity73 and slash : combat does get repetitive , but the execution mechanic is still quite enjoyable controls are responsive enough ( although the lack of a jump button may annoy ) while the optional function of shouting orders through @entity19 is n't as smooth as it should be			2
still , if you want a game that looks very pretty ... @entity84 ( best racer ) no launch title on @entity1 perhaps best shows off the console 's power more than @entity84			1
with more than 200 photo - realistic cars , 14 circuits and stunning full hd graphics , there is plenty under @entity84 's hood to hit the right ( engine ) notes with race fans			2
running at 60 frames per second ( last - gen games usually ran at @entity101 ) , racing is incredibly smooth and environments , stunning			1
@entity103 or fake ? you 'll often be asking that yourself when looking at @entity84 's glorious visuals on close inspection , some of the minor details - such as vegetation and trees - still look extremely dated , but you 'll be whizzing past them so quickly , it 's unlikely to bother you			2
the nifty @entity113 feature lets you upload your driving to the @entity1 cloud - recording intricate details about how you drive so that other people around the world can challenge a virtual ' you ' to a race , any time they like			0
@entity121 ( best beat - em - up - it 's the only one so far ! ) it may lack a single - player mode and a vast array of characters to choose from , but this resurrection of a @entity129 classic is still great fun			0
plus , it 's free if you 're happy to play as one character			0
if you want more , you have buy them			0
at launch , the full - game comes with six characters , with eight more soon after as downloadable content			1
fight club : there is no single player campaign , with gameplay centering around taking on human foes combat is frenetic , focusing on a breaker system and ' locking ' into combination chains			0
it takes some time to master , but it 's incredibly satisfying when you string together moves			0
graphically , apart from solid 60fps frame rate and the odd finely - detailed particle , there 's nothing really ' next - gen ' about the visuals			0
it 's still pleasing on the eye , though , and great fun with a friend			0
battlefield 4 ( best first - person shooter ) this may have been out for a while on last - gen , but if you have n't played it on pc , it 'll be worth a look on @entity1			0
if you 're into your multiplayer gaming , the @entity1 version can house 64 players per server - doubling that found in last generation 's version			0
fall of duty : the next - gen version of @entity175 looks stunning - thanks to a full - fat @entity176 the campaign looks much better , too , thanks to a full - fat @entity180 - not the scaled down version used on @entity182 and @entity183			1
there are still problems in the single - player campaign with the @entity187 , though			0
enemies will run right past your teammates and make a beeline for you , take cover right next to your squad mates and launch grenades at every given minute			1
but these gripes do n't massively detract from the experience			0
battlefield 4 is a compelling package - and more than worthy of checking out on @entity1			0
@entity199 14 ( best sports game ) if you have this for last - gen consoles , then there 's very little point picking this up at launch			1
graphics are sharper , thanks to @entity211 's @entity210 , and the game runs more smoothly			0
that being said , multiplayer matches may be harder to pin down , given that most people will be playing on @entity182 still			1
back of the net : but apart from the odd visuals tweak , stick with your last - gen copy of the game if you have it other sports games such as @entity223 , though , look noticeably better on the @entity1 - and should be considered if you 're after something different			1
@entity226 : @entity229 ( best kids ' game ) it looked stunning on the last crop of consoles , and looks even better on @entity1			1
yes , @entity233 have delivered another brilliant @entity226 game - and thanks to an impressive roster of heroes , including the x-men , @entity240 and the @entity241 - it 's sure to be a hit with comic book fans old and young			0
awesome : it already looked great on last - gen , but @entity229 looks its best on @entity1 the best @entity226 game yet ... and essential if you do n't own it yet			0
@entity248 : @entity248 ( @entity250 adventure game ) @entity248 may seem like an act of desperation from @entity253 , hoping to get the @entity39 franchise back on track , but this is the best @entity39 title to date and one of the finest releases we ’ve seen in 2013			0
whale of a time : @entity248 is a great game , but it 's worth experiencing how the developers intended it to look on @entity1 , there 's a host of next - gen features , thanks to @entity269			0
expect the game to look sharper and run at @entity271			0
indeed , the difference is so stark , that it may be worth trading in your current copy and upgrading ... especially if you 're still early on in the game			0
last words ... @entity280 have a wide range of games available to suit all tastes			1
but do n't forget the @entity182			1
for those put off by the hefty £ 429 price tag , the 360 offers an enormous games library for a fraction of the price			1
top titles such as @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 : @entity294 can be picked up quite cheaply , and are better quality games than all of the launch titles			1
plus , @entity280 will still make games for the 360 for a couple more years , so you 'll never really be out of the loop if you opt for / stick with the older hardware			1
that is ... until @entity304 and @entity305 are released			0
@entity306 avoid these games on the @entity1 : @entity308 and @entity309			1
follow us on @entity311 : @ @entity312 and on @entity313 : @entity314 .			0
