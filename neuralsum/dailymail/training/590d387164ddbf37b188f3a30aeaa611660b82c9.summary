it was the day after a wretched night before and @entity1 , still grappling with @entity4 's @entity3 defeat in @entity5 , was talking strikers			1
given that @entity7 had been anonymous for most of the game in @entity9 and @entity10 was still injured , @entity1 had been asked whether @entity4 had made sufficient moves during the transfer window just gone to cover @entity14 's departure			1
in a flash , he provided an answer that offered a tantalising glimpse of what the future might hold			0
@entity20 has started this season well for @entity21 , including scoring a penalty against @entity23 @entity14 was the @entity24 's best player last season and @entity4 have struggled to replace him with @entity10 out injured , @entity1 ' side have struggled to find their best form @entity20 is doing better than @entity4 's four other strikers			1
he has scored four goals in nine club matches this season			0
@entity10 scored once in his three matches before his injury @entity7 has also found the net once in eight @entity4 matches ( he has picked up two yellow cards , however ) @entity37 has not scored in eight appearances @entity39 has no goals in three matches @entity4 spent close to £ 110million in the summer and it is the £ 9m they handed over to @entity21 for @entity20 which @entity1 believes could be the finest investment			1
' there are very few players who can replace @entity14 , ' @entity1 explained			0
' actually there are no players who can replace @entity14			0
when you look at the availability of other players during the summer , it was something that was difficult for us			0
' it 's no good now i know but we took a player in @entity20 who we believe will be world class and we 'll get him in the summer			1
now he is a top player			0
he has everything : the speed , the profile and so on and he ( could ) play ( for @entity4 ) now			0
' @entity65 has always been highly - regarded , as one story from his youth shows			2
when he was a 13 - year - old , his first club @entity69 had taken all their age - group squads to the @entity73 coast for pre-season training and on the last night , they had a ' keepie - up ' challenge			1
@entity20 shot to fame with his goal at the @entity78 , but @entity4 were interested before that @entity65 is a key member of @entity82 's next generation of talent and @entity1 believes he can be world class players were invited on to stage to show off their skills , with some players doing 30 , others doing 70			1
when it came to @entity65 , he did a remarkable 1,500			2
those close to him say he likes to play the game ' beautifully ' and enjoys pulling off technical tricks			0
' our deal was that we could n't bring him in now , ' @entity1 continued			2
' that was unfortunate because he can run in behind ( the defence ) , he can keep the ball , he can press and he can run but that ( @entity65 staying with @entity21 ) was part of the deal			2
' there is no chance @entity65 will be allowed to come to @entity102 in january but it is clear that @entity1 is already counting down the days until he gets to start working on a day - to - day basis with a 19 - year - old who shot to prominence during the @entity78			1
the young @entity73 rose to prominence in @entity108 , where injuries and form led to him starting twice for @entity82 @entity4 had been working quietly on a deal to sign him long before he scored against @entity112			1
the wheels of his switch to @entity115 had already started rolling and the move was not a reaction to that moment of magic in the footballing cathedral the @entity121			0
of all the deals @entity4 concluded during a frantic three - month period , the ones that were met with most satisfaction involved @entity65 and @entity126 , as they illustrate what the club under @entity128 are aiming to promote			1
the idea is to buy outstanding young talent at a reasonable price and use @entity1 ' ability on the coaching field to transform them into genuine world class players			1
an ankle injury has prevented can from showing what he can do so far , while @entity65 is across the @entity139			0
@entity126 is another of @entity4 's young recruits who has not yet made an impact but suits the philosophy @entity65 is with the @entity82 squad ahead of their fixtures with @entity145 and @entity146 this week but while he is out of sight , he is not out of mind			1
@entity4 are closely monitoring his progress – he has scored three goals in @entity152 and one in the @entity154 this season , helping @entity21 get off to a solid start – and @entity1 , @entity65 has revealed , is in constant contact			1
' sometimes @entity1 sends me some messages and sometimes people from @entity4 come and visit me in @entity21 , ' said @entity20			1
' it 's good to know they are following my progress			0
things are going well but there 's still some room for improvement			0
' i 'm still working hard trying to prepare myself for a higher level			0
i 'm feeling good and ready to continue this form			0
@entity7 and @entity37 have failed to hit their stride since arriving at @entity102 this summer @entity65 is keen to arrive at his parent club next summer , as @entity4 hope to develop him into a top player ' it 's a new era at @entity4 and everything will go well			2
they have a fantastic team			0
it 's only positive and i do n't think we have to worry about @entity4			2
' @entity1 may have caused eyebrows to raise amongst some @entity4 supporters when he admitted that his side have been ' unrecognisable ' from the swashbuckling group of last season and that a period of transition beckons			1
one thing that he can not be accused of lacking , however , is a vision and the arrival of @entity65 is something he believes will accelerate this group even further			2
where this particular player is concerned , the end of the current season can not come quick enough for @entity4 .			0

@entity1 says young striker @entity20 can be ' world class '
@entity4 boss believes @entity65 was ready for @entity4 this season
@entity21 would n't let @entity73 leave and he already has four goals
@entity4 are in regular contact with the 19 - year - old
when he was a *kid* , @entity65 impressed by doing 1,500 keep - ups
