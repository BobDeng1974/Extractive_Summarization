i would think it through as if i was the main character in @entity5			1
' it was all a big mess			0
a complete and utter mess			0
' i think in my mind , because i was living in my fantasy world , in my tv episode that i had created in my mind , i was just trying to find out what it would be like			2

it just was n't the real me			0
it was like me coming back to my senses and reality			0
' it was a huge reality check , it was me coming back into the real world , real life , having to account for my actions			0
' in court , @entity9 admitted telling police ' a pack of lies ' lying to police because she was terrified they would discover her email exchanges with the dealer			1
she said : ' i know i lied , i told many lies			0

' in the call , @entity9 added : ' i have done everything bad and dirty and goddess @entity243 has seen what this girl is doing to her mum and so she has sent me here			2
' the @entity250 goddess @entity243 is said to punish bad acts			0
but @entity9 said she did not mean her ' confession ' literally			2
