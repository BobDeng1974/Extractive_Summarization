by @entity0 published : 18:10 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 2 december 2013 the culling of badgers received another setback yesterday when it emerged that only 40 per cent of the target figure had been achieved in the latest trial scheme			1
environment secretary @entity6 announced that the cull – to reduce tuberculosis in cattle – missed its quota in @entity11 , even after it was cut from 70 per cent to 58 per cent and marksmen were given an extra five weeks			1
labour environment spokesman @entity13 said mr @entity6 – who blamed earlier problems on ‘ badgers moving the goalposts ’ – had been humiliated			1
only 40 per cent of the target figure were culled in the pilot scheme which has been hailed as a success by @entity6 the shadow environment secretary said : ' despite revising downwards the estimated number of badgers and extending the trials contrary to clear scientific advice , @entity6 has still failed to reduce the badger population by his own stated goal of 70 per cent			1
' the decision to revoke this badger cull licence is a humiliation for @entity6 and must spell the end for his misguided and unscientific policy			1
' mr @entity6 revealed that just 213 badgers were killed in the final five weeks of the cull , bringing the total to 921			1
presenting the figures in a written statement to @entity37 , he said : ' this represents a reduction of just under 40 per cent in the estimated badger population before culling began			2
' despite failing to cull a sufficient number of badgers , mr @entity6 hailed the pilot as a success			1
the setback was described as a ' humiliating ' blow to @entity6 ' the extension in @entity11 has therefore been successful in meeting its aim in preparing the ground for a fully effective four - year cull			1
' i would like to pay tribute to the local farmers and landowners who have undertaken the pilots in both areas , often in difficult terrain and weather , and often in the face of intimidation by a small minority			0
' culling is only one part of our approach to tackle the spread of @entity68			0
we are using every tool available including tougher movement controls for cattle , better biosecurity on farms and working to develop effective and usable cattle and badger vaccines			0
' @entity76 announced last week that shooting was being halted in @entity11 three weeks before schedule , as it became clear that the revised cull target would not be met			2
but mr @entity6 hailed the scheme as a success and said the cull was only part of the battle against @entity68 backed by farmers and vets			1
an @entity87 of experts will consider the information collected during the pilots			0
their report is due to be published early in 2014 and then the government will have to decide whether to repeat the cull in other parts of @entity76			0
mr @entity6 added : ' while there are important lessons to learn , completing two pilots this year has been a significant achievement and is another major step towards halting the spread of bovine tb			2
' an extension to a separate pilot cull in @entity103 also failed to meet its target			2
the @entity103 trial killed 65 per cent of badgers , still short of the 70 per cent			2
the shortfalls come despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards			0
@entity13 described the pilot as a ' misguided and unspecified policy ' while @entity113 president @entity112 said his union was backing the scheme @entity117 spokesman @entity116 said the end of the cull was a ' humiliating and inevitable setback ' for mr @entity6			1
' this ill - advised cut - rate shambles has involved miscalculation of badger populations , manipulated time scales , huge expense for the taxpayer in policing costs , and the fiasco of repeatedly missed targets , ' he said			0
' if it was not so serious it would be comical and should never have happened in the first place			0
' the @entity133 has continued to support the rolling out of further culls in other parts of the country			0
the union 's president @entity112 said : ' the @entity113 remains committed to supporting wider roll - out to help prevent the spread of this terrible disease			0
' government figures show more than 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in @entity76 in 2012 because of bovine @entity68 .			0

only *931* badgers have been culled in total
@entity149 had five extra weeks and a lowered target to complete scheme
the setback has been described as ' humiliating ' for @entity154
@entity6 however says pilot was a success
