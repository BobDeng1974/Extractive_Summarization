' he looks scary to some people			0
' the couple 's two children were also in complete agreement about their father 's look , with his daughter telling the @entity9 cameras : ' i tell my dad he looks like a hobo when he embarrasses me			0
' like when we 're in public and he 'll have food stuck in his mustache or something			0
' even mr @entity10 admitted that his style was perhaps more than a little dated , although added that being on the pulse in term 's of the latest fashions and styles means little to him in his job as a @entity11 instructor and gym owner			1
' so if i had to describe my look , i would say maybe it 's " caveman " ? ' he said			0
family man : the father - of - two had an emotional reunion with his wife @entity19 following the 60 - minute makeover style icon : after emerging from the show 's ' time machine ' , mr @entity10 was met with rapturous applause from both his wife and the rest of the @entity9 audience members surprise ! mr @entity10 was only allowed to see his reflection after showing off his new look to his wife and it was n't just mr @entity10 's hair and beard that were being made over by @entity9 's team of experts ; many of his favorite wardrobe staples were also up on the chopping block			1
' my husband 's closet is all @entity11 or workout t - shirts , ' his wife explained , while his daughter added : ' it 's not ok for my dad to wear cat shirts			2
' undoubtedly realizing that partaking in @entity9 's makeover program would save him years of nagging from his beloved wife , mr @entity10 agreed to put himself in the hand 's of the show 's expert team of stylists , which included stylist @entity112 , hair stylist @entity113 and makeup artist @entity114			1
