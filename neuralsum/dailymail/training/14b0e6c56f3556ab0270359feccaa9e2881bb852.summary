by @entity0 published : 12:42 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 6 february 2013 a @entity2 woman who was living abroad because she thought it was safer than the @entity2 was repeatedly beaten and raped twice before she died in @entity4 , an inquest has heard			1
@entity6 moved to @entity4 after she was offered a job working in the picturesque resort town of @entity9 which is popular with many @entity2 tourists and ex-pats			1
despite her parents telling her to come home on a number of occasions , the 34 - year - old thought it was safer to stay in @entity4			2
tragic : the inquest heard @entity6 was beaten and raped twice before she died in @entity4 but an inquest into her death heard that @entity21 was repeatedly beaten up by her @entity4 boyfriend , raped twice - once by two men - and later died in hospital after her partner delayed taking her there			1
her boyfriend , referred to in the inquest only as ' @entity29 ' , then disappeared leaving @entity4 police and @entity2 authorities little hope of finding out what had happened to her			1
her father , @entity35 , said miss @entity6 would regularly call him and her mother @entity36 at their home in @entity39 to tell them of the beatings she experienced			1
' she used to cry over the phone and plead with us to get her out of there but the next moment we would get a phone call saying he 's apologised ' , said mr @entity48			0
' i never believed any of it - she was always in fear of her life			2
' picturesque : the pretty town of @entity9 in @entity4 where @entity6 died mr and mrs @entity6 , from @entity55 , near @entity56 , visited their daughter months before her death but said on their trip she had seemed happier			1
' if we 'd have known she was unhappy that day we would have found some way to have brought her back but you ca n't say to an adult " you 're coming home with us			0
" ' mr @entity48 said his daughter had been offered a job by a friend when the it company she was previously working for went bust and so decided to stay in @entity4			2
' she said she felt safer there than she did over here , surprisingly enough , ' he told the inquest in @entity75 , @entity39			0
' when you take it at face value , @entity9 is a nice place			2
' @entity6 ( pictured ) was asked to come home by her parents on a number of occasions @entity84 , a @entity2 shopkeeper who befriended miss @entity6 in @entity9 , told the hearing that although she had initially seemed happy he would often see her covered in bruises or drunk - and that she had told friends she turned to alcohol to take away the pain of the beatings			1
' you would see her come in with bruises , ' he told @entity39 coroner @entity93			0
' she was very thin and not eating properly , ' he added			0
' we knew of @entity29			0
he was n't in our circle of friends but we knew of him and i can only describe him as one of the many @entity4 rogues			2
' the perception is it happens to so many @entity2 single women , from 15 to 90 , they fall in love with a good looking guy and end up spending all their money on him			0
@entity29 was of that ilk			0
' the inquest was told how @entity29 was controlling of @entity21 and her friends suspected she was being forced to spend all her money on him , leaving her without enough to eat			0
another of miss @entity6 's friends , @entity111 , said in a statement given to the hearing that on may 24 last year she had been raped by two men			1
local @entity4 newspapers reported that the men had been armed with guns			2
however the coroner said that he had been given no evidence this was the case			0
' she appears to have been followed by two men who dragged her to the ground and raped her , ' said mr @entity111 's statement			2
' on leaving the police station with her @entity4 boyfriend @entity29 , he attacked her , blaming her for being raped and beat her again			1
' mr @entity111 also said miss @entity6 had reported to @entity4 police that she had been beaten			1
however she did not name @entity29 as the perpetrator , as she was ' terrified of him			0
' miss @entity6 had also reported she had been raped before in @entity4			1
the coroner heard miss @entity6 fell ill in the fortnight before she died and would rarely leave the house			1
another friend , named as @entity134 , visited and suggested @entity29 take miss @entity6 to hospital but when he returned at around 5pm he found her unconscious			1
he then called an ambulance and miss @entity6 was rushed to @entity137 but later died july 16 , 2012			1
mr @entity111 's statement said : ' if @entity29 had taken her to hospital at 9am , would the outcome have been different ? ' mr @entity93 said he had only been given her cause of death as ' respiratory failure ' , and being of ' pathological origin ' , and that a second post mortem examination carried out in the @entity2 was also inconclusive			0
however , two toxicology reports both said she had not consumed alcohol or drugs and there were no signs she was bruised or had suffered any injury			0
mr @entity93 said that @entity29 had given @entity4 police a statement in which he described miss @entity6 as a ' friend '			1
the inquest was told that @entity29 had since vanished and that @entity4 police were not investigating the matter further			2
mr @entity93 said : ' there 's no evidence that the beatings , the alleged rapes or anything of that kind were a factor and the description from @entity111 and @entity134 of vomiting and sweats suggests a more disease - related problem			0
' i have no clinical evidence beyond that			0
' mr @entity93 said he had no option but to record an open verdict and that although there was scope for this to be re-examined should more information come to light - he doubted this would be the case			0
speaking after the inquest mr @entity48 warned other young women about the perils of emigrating to @entity4			1
' how many other people , young women , will move in the future , or have been to @entity4 and fall into the same trap			1
' my advice to any young woman is that it 's not as safe a place as people think			0
' she was just looking for love and never actually found it			0
