@entity7 suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull , broken ribs and back , bruising and burns			1
she had also been raped repeatedly @entity7 spent ten months in hospital before succumbing to her injuries the case sent shockwaves around the world earlier this year and there was further outrage when it appeared that her father , @entity7 , would be released by a @entity2 court after just a few months in prison			1
the mother , @entity35 , told @entity36 in february : ' my dear child is dead , and all i want now is justice so i can close my eyes and know she did n't die in vain			0
she was brutally tortured in the most shocking ways			0
' a campaign began to force the court , in the town of @entity46 , to stiffen the sentence			2
the same court and judge july re-examined the case , but there is anger once more that the punishment for @entity54 , a prominent @entity55 preacher who regularly appears on television in @entity2 , is too lenient			1
earlier this year activists from the group women to @entity59 said the preacher had doubted @entity7 's virginity and had her checked up by a medic			1
torture : @entity2 preacher @entity7 admitting beating his daughter with a cable and is said to have been concerned about his five - year - old daughter 's virginity @entity68 , a social worker from the hospital where @entity7 was admitted , said the girl 's back was broken and that she had been repeatedly raped			1
her injuries were then burned			2
rather than the death penalty or a long prison sentence , the judge in the case ruled the prosecution could only seek ' blood money ' , according to activists			0
the money is compensation for the next of kin under @entity1 law			0
activists said the judge ruled the few months @entity7 spent in prison since his arrest in november 2012 was sufficient punishment			1
he has reportedly agreed to pay £ 31,000 ( $ 50,000 ) , which is believed to have gone to @entity7 's mother			1
the amount is half that would have been paid if @entity7 had been a boy			2
a social media campaign quickly gained momentum after the ruling was publicised			0
@entity94 launched a campaign on @entity96 using the hashtag ' @entity98 ' , which means ‘ i am @entity7 ’ , calling for better protection for children and women .			2

@entity7 's back was broken and she had been raped and burned
she died in october 2012 from her injuries after ten months in hospital

a campaign *succeeded* in bringing about a stiffer sentence
