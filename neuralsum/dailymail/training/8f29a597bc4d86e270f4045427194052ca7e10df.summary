this is the adorable moment a baby elephant attempts to take on a bus load of tourists with its most ferocious charge - before thinking better of it and running back to its mum			1
the 12 - month - old calf was caught on camera running full - on at the holidaymakers , who were visiting the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
it even attempts jumping up on its back legs practising its most terrifying moves			0
getting ready : the calf stands by the herd as the tourists film from a nearby bus but the rest of the herd carries on grazing , oblivious to its efforts			1
and when the calf realises its on his own , it thinks better of the bold move - and spins round and runs back to mum as fast as it can			2
@entity33 , from @entity34 , which runs the photographic safaris , said : ' it 's pretty unusual to see a young calf behaving like this			0
feeling brave : the baby elephant then takes a run up to the bemused tourists it rears up on to its hind legs as it attempts to scare the holidaymakers ' the babies usually stick pretty close to their mum 's tummy until they 're about a year old , and this little guy seems to be bold enough to be making his first moves in the world			1
' he 's even attempted a little jump , which is no mean feat for an elephant			0
' he 's a little boisterous , and probably wants to see what he can get away with , pushing the boundaries			0
and ... run away ! the baby elephant thinks better of its brave move and scampers back to the herd ' but when the rest of the herd completely ignore the busload of tourists , and his attempt at scaring them off , he obviously still needs his mum - because it 's not long before he runs back to her ! ' i love watching the elephants , especially when the herd has youngsters at this age			2
' it 's absolutely adorable to watch them trying to find their feet , and learning how to use their trunks			0
