@entity2 can prove himself to be world class at the @entity3			1
he can be the positive surprise			0
@entity41 : @entity1 has told @entity10 manager @entity21 that @entity2 will be polished for the @entity3 ‘ @entity10 has a very difficult group but if you come out of a group like that your belief is really strong			1
they have to deal really well with the situation as they have @entity47 and @entity48 in the group and they have to get out of there			0
’ @entity1 also believes @entity2 is ready to put his long run of injuries behind him and show his consistency next season			1
a long - term ankle problem meant he did not make a single appearance during the 2011 - 12 season and just 35 for club and country the following campaign			2

we have seen with @entity75 recently , who is the best player in the world , that being in and out is the most difficult thing to deal with as you need to be competitive and to do that you need to be playing			0
‘ he is a football man , @entity2			2
you speak to him about something in the game and he understands straight away			0
he has a natural football understanding			0
not much in it : @entity1 insists that @entity7 have not fallen behind @entity85 , despite the league table ‘ he watches the game and analyses very well what happens			1

‘ we beat them twice this season and they also benefited from a season when they played only the @entity111			0
