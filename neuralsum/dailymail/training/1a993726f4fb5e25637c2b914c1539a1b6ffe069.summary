education ministers and their staff ' lacked inquisitiveness ' about fears of extremism in schools , a report warned today			1
the @entity7 has been told it needs to ' always be vigilant and inquisitive ' after an internal review said the issue was not taken as seriously as concerns about child protection			1
@entity12 , the ministry 's top official , was asked to carry out the review following the @entity16 allegations of a hardline @entity18 takeover plot at a number of @entity21 schools			2
@entity12 , the permanent secretary at the @entity7 , said the ministry needed to have robust systems in place to play its part in preventing and dealing with the threat to date there have been four other reports into allegations of extremism in @entity21 schools			1
none found evidence of a conspiracy violent extremism or radicalisation in schools in in the city , but they raised concerns about the role of governors in influencing policy and the promotion of an ' aggressive @entity44 ethos '			2
education secretary @entity45 has stressed the importance of all schools teaching ' @entity49 values ' of tolerance and free speech			2
mr @entity12 said he had found no instances of the @entity7 ignoring ' specific warnings ' of extremism in schools but said it needed to have robust systems in place to play its part in preventing and dealing with the threat			1
he said that issues on extremism have been treated as ' one - offs ' and assumed by the @entity7 to be the responsibility of other authorities			1
the review looked at the 20 - year period between 1994 and december 2013 and any warnings received by the @entity7 relating to alleged extremism in @entity21 schools			1
it found that on a small number of occasions , the department received information about these issues , but concludes that these were largely dealt with ' in line with procedures in place at the time '			0
there were no instances in which ministers , officials or advisers acted inappropriately , the review adds			0
but it goes on to say that warnings were raised about issues such as difficult relationships between staff and governors in certain schools , the potential narrowing of a school curriculum and the fact that these issues ' have the potential to cause political , cultural and religious tensions in schools and their communities '			0
education secretary @entity45 has stressed the importance of all schools teaching ' @entity49 values ' of tolerance and free speech these matters are similar to those raised in @entity108 's report into the @entity16 situation , the review says			2
mr @entity12 concludes : ' whilst i have not found instances of warnings having been ignored or of individuals having acted inappropriately , i have found that the @entity7 has lacked inquisitiveness about this issue , and that procedures could have been tighter than they were			1
' whilst this is an easy thing to say in hindsight , there is a marked contrast between , for example , how the @entity7 responds to reports of child protection issues and how it has historically responded to reports of potential extremism			1
' overall i find that in future the @entity7 needs to be more vigilant , more inquisitive and have more robust systems in place than it has had in the past if in future it is to play its part in preventing and countering the issues identified in the @entity133			1
' in her response to the report , mrs @entity134 said she endorsed the findings and recommendations and that further measures are being taken			0
this includes introducing a formal system for staff to refer concerns about extremism to the @entity145 and @entity146 and bringing in a formal case handling system within this division for logging and managing warnings			1
mr @entity12 added : ' issues on extremism in @entity21 schools that have been raised with the @entity7 have in general been assumed to be the responsibility of other authorities , and when they have been brought to the @entity7 's attention have been dealt with as one - off pieces of transactional business			1
' with hindsight , i believe the @entity7 could have shown a greater level of inquisitiveness regarding these issues , and asked itself the question of whether the issues being brought to its attention were symptomatic of wider trends			0
' the review was prompted by the @entity16 letter in @entity21 in december 2013 and subsequent investigations by former anti-terror chief mr @entity108 , @entity171 and @entity173 's inquiry for @entity174 , which noted that warning signs about potential extremism in the city 's schools had been missed by local agencies over a long period of time			0
the letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hardline @entity18 to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city			0
in june , @entity171 issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of @entity21 's schools and declared five failing , placing them into special measures			0
mr @entity108 's report found no evidence of terrorism , radicalisation or violent extremism but did conclude that there was '' clear evidence '' that there were a number of people , associated with each other and in positions of authority within some @entity21 schools who '' espouse , endorse or fail to challenge extremist views ''			0
there were six instances where concerns were raised with the @entity7 , the review found			2
separately , there was also a letter sent to @entity216 in march 2013 , then @entity217 by @entity218 of @entity219 , which @entity218 said they discussed			0
the letter raised similar issues to those in the @entity108 report			0
this letter was not formally part of mr @entity12 's review .			0

@entity7 told it must ' always be vigilant and inquisitive '
fears of extremism not taken as seriously as child protection concerns
permanent secretary @entity12 did not find warnings were ignored
but stressed need for robust systems in place to deal with the threat
