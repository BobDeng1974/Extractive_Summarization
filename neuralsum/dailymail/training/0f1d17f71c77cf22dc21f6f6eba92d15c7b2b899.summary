@entity1 attorney general and the @entity3 's candidate for governor in the @entity6 @entity5 is getting knocked around today for declining to tell a local newspaper whether he would have defended a ban on interracial marriage if he were the state 's lawyer when it was being challenged			1
asked about the outdated law by the @entity14 editorial board as part of an endorsement interview , @entity5 said : ' right now , if there was a ban on interracial marriage , that 's already been ruled unconstitutional			2
' and all i can do is deal with the issues that are before me ... the job of an attorney general is to represent and defend in court the laws of their client , which is the state legislature , unless and until a court strikes it down			1
' he later argued that state government ' would be a dictatorship ' by attorney generals if they were able to choose which laws to defend based on their personal preferences			1
@entity3 gubernatorial nominee and @entity1 attorney general @entity5 waves to supporters at a rally last week			1
@entity5 is under fire today for comments he made during an editorial board interview about interracial marriage @entity5 , left , would n't say today whether he would defended an interracial marriage ban if he 'd been the state 's lawyer at the time			1
progressives attacked the non-answer today and characterized him as racist , even though his wife @entity52 , is @entity53			1
they are pictured here at a 2012 event in @entity1 a member of the @entity57 ' editorial board explained in a write up of the interview that she gave him @entity5 a chance to clarify his answer , and @entity5 said , ' actually , the reason why you ’re uncertain about it is because i did n’t answer the question			0
and i ca n’t go back and answer some hypothetical question like that			0
' @entity5 intended to make the point that it would not be appropriate for him to ' dictate policy ' as ag. that 's the role of lawmakers			1
something he went on to explain to the @entity14 in detail			0
but that 's not how the discussion is playing out , particularly in progressive circles , even though @entity5 's wife , @entity52 , is @entity53			1
if @entity5 is elected in november , as widely expected , @entity80 will become the state 's first @entity53 first lady			1
recent polls have @entity5 leading his @entity85 opponent in the race , state senator @entity84 , by more than 10 points , and the @entity3 official 's comments today on interracial marriage are unlikely to change that			1
still , democrats in the state holding out hope for a victory in 15 days , and they attacked @entity5 's nuanced response to the interracial marriage question today as being both vague and tinged with racism			2
@entity99 , a non-profit that specializes in rapid response communications against @entity3 in the state , posted the first portion of the interview and blasted @entity5 for refusing to answer the question			2
you can and should answer a question like that			0
the answer @entity109 deserve to hear from a man that is running to be their governor is a definitive : “ no , i would not			0
" ' the progressive organization said @entity5 's answer shows ' just how out - of - touch and backwards ' he is			2
it also hit him for advocating on behalf of the state 's contentious voter identification law			0
@entity85 gubernatorial democratic candidate @entity84 talks to supporters before casting her vote on the first day of early voting today at the @entity122 , in @entity123 , @entity1			0
@entity124 said on monday that @entity5 's refusal to say whether he would have defended a law banning interracial marriage is ' troubling ' @entity124 also linked @entity5 's position on interracial marriage to his support for the state 's voter id law the @entity134 @entity133 said saturday that it would allow the statute to go into effect ahead of november 's election , despite pleas from @entity134 attorney general @entity139 to block it			1
@entity5 's office praised the @entity133 's decision last weekend in a statement			2
' we are pleased that the @entity134 @entity133 has agreed that @entity1 ' voter id law should remain in effect for the upcoming election , ' a spokeswoman for the @entity146 's office , @entity144 , said			0
' the state will continue to defend the voter id law and remains confident that the district court 's misguided ruling will be overturned on the merits			2
the @entity134 @entity133 has already ruled that voter id laws are a legal and sensible way to protect the integrity of elections			0
' @entity85 believe that the laws purposefully disenfranchise black voters			0
in discussing @entity5 's interracial marriage conundrum today , @entity99 accused him of defending a statute that ' intentionally discriminated against @entity164 and @entity53			1
' @entity124 also linked his position on the interracial marriage ban to his support for the state 's voter id law			0
' @entity5 wo n't say whether he 'd defend an interracial marriage ban — troubling but not surprising from someone who defends a " poll tax , " ' @entity124 tweeted			2
@entity5 , left , speaks to a group of supporters on tuesday , oct. 14 , 2014 , in @entity175 , @entity1			0
@entity5 has been wheelchair bound since a tree fell on him in 1984			0
he sued the property owner and won millions			0
@entity124 has made the incident an issue in the gubernatorial race @entity5 was asked if he would advocate on behalf of an interracial marriage ban by the @entity14 after a @entity3 attorney general candidate in @entity184 said recently that he would have defended the law if he were the state 's lawyer even though ' it might be distasteful to me			1
' ' i 've got to stay consistent with that — as the state 's lawyer , it 's not my job to pick and choose ' which laws to uphold , the candidate , @entity189 , said			1
seeking to avoid the same media firestorm that followed @entity189 's response , @entity5 opted not to answer the hypothetical question when it was posed to him by the @entity14			2
he did , however , give a similar explanation for why he would advocate on behalf of the state for a law even if he did n't agree with it			0
' what kind of state would we live in if the public policies of this state were allowed to be determined by the attorney general ? ' @entity5 said			1
' the attorney general would have a super veto over the elected representatives , and that would be a chaotic form of government , contrary to our fundamental constitutional principles			1
it would be way beyond the separation of powers			0
it would be a dictatorship ... by the attorney general			1
' @entity5 said he ' would love it ' if the state 's attorney had broad authority to set statewide policies			1
' the state would look a whole lot more like me right now if i did abandon my role and exercised my magic wand and decided what cases i would defend and which i did n't , and therefore allowed me to dictate policy in this state , ' he said			1
' but i think that by doing what i do , i am maintaining the policy that i think is appropriate , and that is for each elected official to fulfill their constitutional obligations , ' @entity5 added			2
the @entity1 gubernatorial race has had no shortage of drama in the last several weeks , even before @entity5 's comments today and the @entity133 's mandate over the weekend			2
@entity124 , whose claim to fame is an abortion rights filibuster she held on the state senate floor last year , has accused wheelchair - bound @entity5 of denying other victims the same justice he received after he was injured while jogging more than three decades ago			0
after a tree fell on @entity5 he successfully sued the property owner and won millions			0
@entity124 noted his disability in an ad , featuring video of an empty wheel chair , and tried to shame him for litigating cases against other paraplegics and survivors of accidents and crimes			0
the ad was roundly criticized in the media as too harsh but the @entity266 has refused to back down from her claims or yank the commercial .			0

@entity5 argued that ' the job of an attorney general is to represent and defend in court the laws of their client , which is the state legislature '
state government ' would be a dictatorship ' by attorney generals if they were able to choose which laws to defend based on personal preferences
@entity5 intended to make the point that it would not be appropriate for him to ' dictate policy ' as @entity286 , but that 's not how it 's playing
his wife , @entity52 , is @entity53 and will become the first @entity53 first lady if he wins
