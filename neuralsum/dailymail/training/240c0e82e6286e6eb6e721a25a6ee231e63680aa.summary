@entity1 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , posted a picture of her son @entity3 on @entity4 after he was recovering from an illness			1
the photograph showed him playing happily in the garden with the caption : ' it 's been a long week of illness for this one but it looks like he 's finally on the mend			1
' however , she did not expect a cruel response from an internet troll			1
the person left a one - word comment underneath the photo which read ' ugly '			1
however , the proud mother was quick to respond and posted an open letter to the person who made the offensive comment			1
she wrote on her blog site : ' i do n't want to make assumptions about you , but i can guess from your immaturity and ignorance that you know little about the helplessness that parents feel when caring for a sick infant with respiratory issues			1
' @entity3 was sick last week , but was feeling much better by friday			2
' we decided to sit in the backyard and soak up the sun after school			0
' there are n't many things in this world more beautiful than seeing your recently - ill child light up in a smile , and i snapped a few photos to celebrate his recovery , then posted them on @entity4 with the hashtag â € œ # downsyndrome			1
' the fact that you find my child ugly is one thing			2
' you are entitled to your opinion			0
but the fact that you intentionally search # downsyndrome to find pictures to insult ( sadly , @entity3 is not the only victim of your behavior ; i came across many other inflammatory responses ) is both childish and sad			2
backlash : people were quick to respond to the troll who posted the word ' ugly ' under the photo ' what about purposefully seeking out pictures of our children ? what about the fact that a beautiful photograph of my son was tarnished by your hatred ? ' that 's not a joke			1
needless to say , i reported your profile			0
' this will not be the last time someone discounts my son because he is different			2
' it will not be the last time someone makes a joke at his expense , but to actively seek out actual people to tease goes beyond cruel			0
' i simply hope my own children learn to look past ignorant comments and actions and treat others with respect and dignity			0
we all deserve it , even you			0
' loving family : @entity1 ( left ) with @entity110 ( bottom left ) and @entity112 ( right ) ms @entity1 searched the troll 's site and what she found disgusted her			1
she wrote : ' your profile is also full of offensive posts and crude statements , all of which point to your own illiteracy			0
' you claim it was a joke and that people should lighten up			0
but what about purposefully seeking out pictures of our children ? ' ms @entity1 signed off her blog post with the words ' a @entity131 '			2
the letter has gone viral and there has been global support for the @entity137 teacher who has two children			0
this week she wrote : ' i ca n't even begin to express my gratitude ; i wish i had time to respond to all your messages personally , but due to the overwhelming influx of support , this is simply impossible			0
' so instead , please accept this post as one giant group hug			0
you all make this world better with your positive outlooks and selfless willingness to reach out to our family			0
