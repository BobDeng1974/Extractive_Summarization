mesothelioma is a cancer of membrane cells which line major organs			2
it occurs most often in tissue around the lungs			0
symptoms of the disease include acute chest pains , such as mrs @entity108 suffered , a persistent cough and difficulty breathing , high temperatures and weight loss			2
more than 2,500 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma every year , with five times more men than women falling victim			2
according to the @entity118 , the disease is ' almost always ' caused by asbestos , and takes 20 to 60 years to develop after the initial exposure			0
the cancer can be difficult to diagnose accurately , as affected cells do not look distinctive			2
chemotherapy is the main treatment			0
some surgical procedures are being investigated , but remain unproven			0
because mesothelioma is so difficult to diagnose , it is often terminal by the time doctors notice			2
patients rarely survive more than three years after diagnosis			0
the average is 12 months			0
some 2,300 per year die of the disease , though experts expect this to increase as more workers exposed to asbestos in past decades are affected			0
by 2050 , it is thought the cancer will have taken 90,000 lives			0

' this room was chosen to provide greater privacy for the patient and family than would be afforded on the ward bays			0
' we will be looking at the lighting in the room to see if changes can be made or a lamp can be installed to enable the lighting to be adjusted			0
' a reclining chair was made available to allow mrs @entity28 to rest and while she spent time with her husband			0
' we will take on board all the issues that have been raised and will be making changes where possible to improve the care we provide			2
