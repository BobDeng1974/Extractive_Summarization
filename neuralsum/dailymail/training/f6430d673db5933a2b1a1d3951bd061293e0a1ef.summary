stock markets have endured another roller - coaster day as brokers digest details of a rescue plan for the @entity5 being drawn up by finance ministers - and there are signs that the markets are improving			2
reports from the weekend suggested a £ 2.6trillion plan was being drawn up to allow @entity12 to escape repayment on half of its towering debt and to quadruple the size of @entity19 's bailout fund			1
the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) has been co-ordinating talks with leaders in @entity23 and has reportedly drawn up a plan aimed at providing a way for @entity12 to manage a default on its debt , which now stand at 160 per cent of its gdp			1
and @entity30 rallied on hopes that a deal may be near with @entity33 the biggest @entity35 riser , up 7 per cent			2
the ftse 100 index of leading shares opened down 2 per cent this morning but by the end of monday there was a 22 point rise it is thought the plan will include a 50 per cent write down to those debts , with private investors , notably eurozone banks , suffering huge losses on the @entity12 government debt they hold			1
this morning the @entity35 opened below 5000 , after a drop of more than 90 points , but later recovered to stand 52 points higher at 5118.7 - however by closing , the market was up 0.45 per cent or just 22.5 points			2
@entity19 markets also moved forward with both the @entity54 in @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity57 posting gains of more than 2 per cent despite a closely watched survey of @entity61 business confidence sinking again in september			2
@entity62 , markets analyst at @entity64 , predicted a roller - coaster ride for markets while details of the plan are thrashed out			2
she said : ' a sufficiently credible plan to solve the eurozone crisis will necessitate changes to treaties , laws , and not least the @entity61 constitution			2
' there will be wobbles and uncertainty at every vote and stage of political implementation			2
' according the @entity82 's @entity81 , the deal could involve a write - down of half of @entity12 's massive government debt			1
but @entity12 finance minister @entity86 dismissed reports that he has discussed a scenario of an orderly default by @entity90 with @entity20 chief @entity91 and @entity93 head @entity92			1
' we have reached a point where there are reports about what has been said in a closed door meeting with the participation of only mrs @entity91 , mr @entity92 and myself , ' he said in a statement			0
' what is absolutely sure is that there has n't been and could n't have been any discussion about the so - called scenario of an orderly default			0
' however the @entity20 last night issued an extraordinary warning that it might not have enough cash to stem the crisis engulfing the @entity5 , prompting fears that @entity112 could be forced to find billions more to bail out debt - stricken economies			1
chancellor @entity115 has refused to put @entity112 funds on the line for a new @entity119 rescue scheme but he would be unable to resist a call from the @entity20 to do more			1
time for action : chancellor @entity115 ( left ) will be under pressure to help fund the new scheme , but his predecessor @entity124 ( right ) says decisive action is needed the dramatic development came as @entity127 was forced to deny speculation that it is on the brink of having to bail out its banking system			2
emergency plans are being drawn up for a £ 2.6trillion deal aimed at saving the euro by allowing @entity12 to default on its massive debts			1
the funds would be used to create a ‘ firewall ’ around the most indebted @entity5 countries , allow for an ‘ orderly ’ @entity12 default on its towering debts , and bail out those @entity19 banks most at risk			1
traders saw a further fall in the price of gold today as the traditional safe haven in times of economic turmoil continued its surprise descent			0
the precious metal is down by more than 300 @entity151 dollars per ounce in the last three weeks , from a record peak of 1921 @entity151 dollars an ounce on september 6 to less than 1600 @entity151 dollars today			0
experts are at odds as to why gold and silver prices have fallen , with some citing a drop in global price pressures and others saying the commodity has been overbought			0
@entity163 , the world 's largest futures market , has also increased the minimum investment value to cover itself amid market uncertainty			0
the recent dive in economic confidence should inspire a flight to gold - as the metal tends to outperform other commodities in times of crisis and also acts as a hedge against inflation			0
@entity177 , chief global economist at @entity178 , said two of the pillars that supported investors ' confidence in gold have been ' knocked away ' - namely fears of a surge in inflation and a collapse in the @entity151 dollar			0
he said : ' the 300 @entity151 dollar fall in the price of gold has caught most commentators by surprise - including us			0
' demand for gold as an inflation hedge has fallen as the global economy has slowed and other commodity prices have tumbled			0
' former chancellor @entity124 warned yesterday that the world is facing a bigger economic crisis than it did three years ago			0
‘ the @entity12 crisis has been allowed to run on and on and on , ’ mr @entity124 said			1
‘ only this weekend it appears the governments have realised it is only a matter of time before @entity12 defaults			1
‘ it is imperative the @entity5 countries take action now and not let it drag on for the next few weeks because the risk is it will bring down other countries with it			0
’ he added : ‘ the situation today is more serious than it was three years ago			0
there are lessons to be learnt and they are not being learnt by those responsible at the moment			0
’ in a bid to head off a wave of selling when stock markets re-open today , @entity127 ’s central bank insisted the country ’s besieged lenders were strong enough to withstand a @entity12 debt default			1
@entity224 governor @entity222 described as ‘ preposterous ’ claims that @entity127 lenders are facing a run on their deposits because of concerns over their £ 36billion exposure to @entity12			1
and he rejected reports that the @entity127 government was planning to use taxpayers ’ cash to shore up the beleaguered banks			0
mr @entity115 has warned that @entity19 ’s political elite have just six weeks to tame the debt storm engulfing the 17 - nation single currency – or risk pitching the global economy back into recession			0
following its meeting in @entity23 , the @entity20 warned that it could run out of cash if contagion spreads beyond the crippled periphery of the @entity5			1
its £ 248billion bailout fund may not be big enough if the global economy plunges into the mire because of the debt crisis , according to @entity20 chief @entity91			1
the watchdog ’s current emergency fund ‘ looks comfortable today but pales in comparison with the potential financing needs of vulnerable countries and crisis bystanders ’ , mrs @entity91 warned			0
global leaders are in a race against time to shore up the @entity5 and prevent a @entity12 default from triggering a full - blown financial meltdown			1
‘ we need a big bazooka , ’ said one senior official at the @entity20			1
@entity260 chairman @entity259 said : ‘ [ there is ] the looming danger that failure to take decisive action in @entity19 and the @entity151 may shake the entire global economy , throwing developing countries off track – and they are today ’s engine of global growth			0
the key message is that we are closer to the edge			0
’ nerve centre : @entity20 's headquarters in @entity23 @entity12 tragedy : students and teachers march during a protest in central @entity90 last week			1
@entity12 is swept by strikes amid new budget cuts imposed in the face of bankruptcy the expected default by @entity12 on its £ 305billion of sovereign debt will be a huge blow to the credibility of the @entity5 and send shockwaves through the banking systems of @entity61 , @entity127 and @entity288			2
it will also add fuel to the debate about the viability of a single currency			0
@entity61 finance minister @entity294 was highly critical of rescuing those countries that had been foolish enough to build up mountains of sovereign debt , arguing they should not be rewarded for their profligacy , saying : ‘ you can not cure an alcoholic by giving him alcohol			1
