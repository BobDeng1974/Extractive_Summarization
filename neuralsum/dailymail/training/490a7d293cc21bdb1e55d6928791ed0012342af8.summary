by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 17:18 est , 16 june 2013 @entity1 has compared herself to @entity3 ' wife in an interview given while she supports her boyfriend during a dismal performance at the @entity7			1
the apparent slip of the tongue might surprise @entity3 , not to mention his recent ex-wife @entity10 , as @entity1 and @entity3 have been dating just three months			1
the 28 - year - old @entity12 skier has become something of a fixture on the golfing circuit as she has been pictured keeping a close eye on @entity3 at various courses			1
during a quiet moment at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 on friday , ms @entity1 said that she did n't give the champion golfer advice about his game but that she was a sounding board for him as ' lots of people go home and talk to their wife or husband about their job '			1
we really are normal in that way			0
lots of people go home and talk to their wife or husband about their job			0
that ’s what we do			0
' woods had a lot of ground to make up on sunday in @entity21 , @entity22 after he skidded to seven bogeys and a 6 - over - par 76 on saturday			1
woods tumbled down the leader board and matched his worst round as a pro at the @entity7			1
ms @entity1 was more of a casual presence on the sidelines than at previous competitions			1
the @entity12 skier has been dressed casually in a t - shirt , jeans , sunglasses and baseball cap from her sponsor @entity78 as she closely tracked @entity3 around the course			1
she tweeted on thursday : ' day one here we go ! ' before posting several pictures of golf fans ' muddy feet at the rain - sodden course			2
at the masters in @entity88 last month , ms @entity1 turned heads at the course in a clinging beige floor length dress and coordinated sunhat			1
however it appears that being relegated to the role of golf @entity95 is rather irksome to the glamorous @entity97 whose last appearance with @entity3 was at the @entity99 in @entity100			2
biggest fan : @entity1 waits near the clubhouse as she watches @entity3 during what has been a rocky performance by the golfer golf @entity95 : @entity1 , an @entity12 skier , made sure she had a @entity78 sponsor 's hat firmly on her head during a more casual appearance at a tournament exasperated : @entity3 reacts after missing a putt during the second round of the 2013 @entity7 she also told the @entity46 : ' some people seem to forget that i ’m not just @entity3 ’s girlfriend			1
i ’m actually a successful athlete			0
i have my own career and my own life			0
' she added that she was ' very happy ' and that despite the constant attention that has come with dating the world 's most famous golfer , the relationship is ' worth it '			0
@entity3 is currently ten strokes behind third - round leader @entity127 , the only player under par at the short but devilishly tough @entity20			1
despite leading the @entity129 in putting in recent weeks , @entity3 needed 36 putts on the severely undulating greens			2
he blamed his inability to gauge the speed of those baffling putting surfaces for his three days of uneven play - and he was right			0
@entity3 is tied for third in fairways hit and 22nd in reaching the greens in regulation			2
but he 's averaged 32 putts per round , which left him tied for 53rd in the field of 73 players			0
afterwards , he said : ' it 's certainly frustrating because i was feeling like i was playing well this week and i just did n't make the putts i needed to make			0
' the first two days , i had , like , three 3 - putts and i was four shots off the lead , and i missed a boatload of putts within 10 feet			0
off his game : @entity3 appeared to be disappointed with his performance on the course in @entity22 good day for golfing : thousands gather to watch @entity3 on the ninth green at the tricky @entity159 course ' so i really was n't that far off			1
if i clean up the round and do n't 3 - putt , i 'm one shot back starting out today			2
basically , i just did n't have the speed right this week and it certainly showed			0
' this @entity7 marks exactly five years since @entity3 won his last major , at @entity163 , which he captured in a playoff against @entity165 , despite hobbling around with ligament damage			1
his pursuit of @entity169 ' career record of 18 majors remains stalled at 14			0
woods also shot a 76 in the final round at @entity173 in 2004 , as well as two rounds of 76 at @entity175 in 2006 when he missed the cut			2
glamor on the green : ms @entity1 ( second left ) watches @entity3 during the masters in @entity88 , @entity179 in april @entity3 ' worst round ever at an @entity7 was a 77 at @entity181 in 1996 , when he was a 19 - year - old amateur			1
what made his performance here perhaps even more surprising is that @entity3 has already won four times this season , including @entity186 - sometimes called golf 's fifth major - and three of his last five starts			1
most recently , however , @entity3 stumbled to an 8 - over - par finish and a tie for 65th at the @entity192 , a tournament he 'd won five times			2
champion : @entity1 was keen to point out at the golf tournament that she was successful in her own right with her career as an @entity12 skier red carpet glamor : @entity3 and girlfriend @entity1 at the @entity202 in @entity203 last month @entity3 said several tough pin placements chosen by the @entity206 's course set up compounded his problems trying to figure out the speed of the greens			1
' look at what they did at ( @entity212 ) 7 and 8 today			0
couple short holes , but 7 is one step and a half over the top of the ridge			0
eight is on the down slope a little bit , and it 's a pretty steep slope			0
so they got some really tough ones out there , ' he said			0
but @entity3 ' also conceded he rarely put his approach shots into those greens where he should have			2
' if you put the ball in the right spots you 've got uphill putts and you can be really aggressive , ' @entity3 said			0
@entity3 now faces the prospect of beginning the final day of yet another major with only the longest of shots to contend			1
what little consolation he could muster came when someone asked : ' tough day ? ' ' yeah , ' @entity3 replied			2
' at least i started well			0

ms @entity1 , 28 , was casually dressed in t - shirt , jeans and baseball cap in @entity21 , @entity22
@entity3 has matched his worst round as a pro at the @entity7 in @entity22 as competition enters the final day
