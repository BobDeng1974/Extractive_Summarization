by @entity0 the @entity2 ca n't boot a bicycle - sharing station out of a space across the street from its entrance , a judge ruled tuesday , rejecting the luxury landmark 's claim that the electric - blue bikes are a traffic - clogging eyesore			1
@entity14 state @entity12 @entity11 said city transportation officials did an adequate review before installing a @entity18 rack on @entity20 's landmarked @entity19 , where the famous @entity19 splashes a stone 's throw from the hotel made famous in fictional settings ranging from the ' @entity26 ' books to @entity28 's play ' @entity29 ' to ' @entity30 : lost in @entity31			1
' ' it does not significantly affect the scale , visual prominence or visual context of these landmarks , ' @entity32 wrote , noting that the bike rack is n't as tall as many cars on the street and that there are bus stations , kiosks and other street structures nearby			1
going nowhere : a @entity18 rack in front of @entity31 's @entity2 will be staying right where it is			1
a judge on monday tossed out a lawsuit calling for the removal of the station legal action : @entity31 's iconic @entity2 overlooking @entity54 attempted to sue the city and @entity56 over the ' eyesore ' blue bike racks near its entrance before it all began : the hotel claims that the bikes takes up a lane of traffic which used to be used by limousines and taxis and has created congestion and litter officials were ' very pleased with this decision , which keeps in place one of the most popular bike share stations in the city , ' city lawyer @entity70 said in a statement			1
plaza lawyer @entity77 said he was reviewing the decision			0
launched in may 2013 , the short - hop bike rental program has become a part of the streetscape in parts of @entity14 and @entity83 , to the delight of some and the lament of others			2
the @entity19 said the 147 - foot - long @entity18 station is an advertising - laden intrusion on @entity19 , where , according to literati lore , @entity90 once took a @entity93 dip in the fountain			2
' we have , here , two landmarks			0
... this is not right for that place , ' another @entity19 lawyer , @entity97 , said at a hearing last week			0
the hotel also argued that the bike rack , which is in a former traffic lane , was causing limousine backups in front of the hotel and condominium during big events			1
unnecessary ? the 147 - foot long bike rack outside the @entity2 is one of the most popular in the city in the way ? the rack is not directly in front of the hotel , but rather at the edge of @entity19 across the street			1
the rack measures almost 150 feet the city said its review was proper , there was plenty of room left for traffic and the location was more than appropriate for a @entity18 rack			2
" this is not only a good location ; it 's an ideal location			0
... it 's centrally located , with numerous attractions nearby , " @entity70 said at last week 's hearing			0
@entity54 is across the street , and the @entity132 and the swank shops of @entity20 are just blocks away			0
@entity18 riders took an average of more than 36,000 trips a day during the summer and fall through the 6,000 - bicycle , 330 - station system			2
more than 99,000 people have bought annual passes			0
but city transportation commissioner @entity140 said last month that the program has faced ' significant financial and operational issues , ' including failed credit card transactions and problems getting bikes to where riders are			0
@entity147 , @entity148 - based @entity146 , which runs @entity18 through a subsidiary , calls the program a success			0
congestion : the bike racks occupy what used to be a lane of traffic for waiting limos and taxis			1

judge tossed out a lawsuit calling for the removal of the station
@entity2 claimed the racks were ' an eyesore ' and ' unnecessary when there are other *alternatives* '
bike *parking* has taken away a lane of traffic , leading to congestion of limousines in front of the hotel
