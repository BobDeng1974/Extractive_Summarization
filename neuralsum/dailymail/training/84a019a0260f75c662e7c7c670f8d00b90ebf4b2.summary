by @entity0 ice - cream vans can play their chimes for longer after the government relaxed rules for operators for the first time in 31 years			1
@entity8 drivers will be allowed to play their famous songs , such as greensleeves or @entity11 , for up to 12 seconds at a time - instead of the previous four			1
vendors can also chime every two minutes while driving , up from just one every three minutes			1
ice - cream van drivers can now play music every two minutes and for up to 12 seconds at a time the announcement yesterday by the @entity16 will be seen as a victory for ice - cream van vendors , who have struggled in recent years			1
but frustratingly for operators , the changes will not be implemented until after the summer , meaning they can not capitalise during their busiest months			2
the changes to the @entity24 on noise from @entity26 means drivers will also be able to chime once when they are parked for the first time			1
however , the government decided not to extend the hours of chiming			2
allowing music to be played until 8pm had been considered but was scrapped after strong opposition from @entity33			1
the government said it was a ' particularly contentious issue '			2
the rules will not come until after the summer , meaning drivers can not capitalise during their busiest months sales of 99s and cornets have hit a record low			1
in the past three years , traditional cones and other stick lollies have dropped by almost a third			2
rising prices have also contributed to the drop			2
only one in four people will buy ice - creams from a van			0
in 2010 the figure was 40 per cent , @entity52 report			0
ice - cream tub sales have hit 333million litres but market research analyst @entity54 said they expect that to fall by nine per cent by 2017			0
the department also decided not to scrap the code altogether after a consultation , in which just 35 members of the public responded			0
@entity8 drivers will also not be able to chime within 165 feet of schools , hospitals or places of worship and no more than once every two hours on the same street			1
the @entity33 opposed any change to the code , saying it ' establishes a balance between noise makers and noise sufferers '			1
however , the ice - cream van industry backed making the little - known clause of the @entity75 1974 less restrictive , which it is hoped will help drivers advertise themselves better			1
since the 1950s , the number of vans on the road has dropped from 20,000 to just a quarter of that figure , according to the @entity80			0
the decline is partially down to a reliance on warm weather , but also ice - cream vans have been targeted by health campaigners			0
the cost of running a van has also escalated			0
buying a new vehicle can cost more than £ 60,000 , while people pay £ 12,000 for a second hand van			0
many local authorities also stopped vans from operating near schools , which the @entity80 said ' hit dying businesses run by lone men in vans , while the supermarkets carry on selling choc ices in value packs			0
' the consultation into the code came after the government launched the @entity103 , a campaign to review all potentially unnecessary business regulation in april 2011 .			0

drivers can now play music for up to 12 seconds instead of previous four
are also allowed to chime every two minutes while driving , instead of three
changes come despite opposition from the @entity33
