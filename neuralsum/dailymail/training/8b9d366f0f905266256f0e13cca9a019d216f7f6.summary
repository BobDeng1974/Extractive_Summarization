by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 is to announce new plans that could see free tv licences and winter fuel payments stripped from well - off pensioners free tv licences and winter fuel payments would be stripped from hundreds of thousands of well - off pensioners to subsidise bus fares for under - 21s in @entity12 plans being unveiled today			2
deputy prime minister @entity2 will insist benefits for ' the rich and retired ' are unjustifiable as he launches his ' pre-manifesto ' for next year 's general election			1
the @entity12 say they will withdraw the perks from all pensioners in the higher - rate tax band , affecting more than 600,000 who pay tax at the 40p rate			0
the cuts would save £ 125million a year , the @entity12 said , which would give all those in @entity24 aged 16 to 21 a bus pass entitling them to two - thirds off tickets			1
the @entity12 and @entity28 are committed to scrapping perks for better - off pensioners – one of dozens of policy areas where they agree , paving the way for a potential @entity33 next year			2
most of the @entity35 is also thought to favour cutting universal benefits for pensioners at the election , @entity40 sources say , and research for no 10 suggests the majority of voters back the idea			0
mr @entity2 will say today : ' young people are required to stay in school until they are 18 , but we have n't done enough to give them the support they need to do that – literally to help them get from a to @entity50 ' i know there are people who say you must n't touch so - called universal pensioner benefits because politically it 's too risky			0
we do n't agree : what are effectively benefits for the rich and retired can not be justified when there are so many young people struggling to get on their feet			0
' the move would be delivered by bus operating companies , who would then be reimbursed by local government , the @entity12 added			1
the party earlier announced it would abolish the married tax allowance to fund free childcare for every two - year - old in @entity24 if they are in government after next year 's general election			1
the plan is a central plank of around 300 policies being unveiled mr @entity2 under the slogan ' stronger economy , @entity76 ' , and is likely to be a sticking point for the party in any coalition negotiations if the election result is inconclusive			0
the party earlier announced it would abolish the married tax allowance to fund free childcare for every two - year - old in @entity24 if they are in government after next year 's general election ( file pic ) the 80 - page document will form the basis of the @entity12 manifesto for the may 2015 poll , subject to approval by the party 's annual conference in @entity91 next month			1
activists will be able to amend the policies and , while their votes are not binding , it is unlikely the leadership would press ahead with any which are roundly rejected			0
@entity12 would guarantee to extend the 15 hours a week of free childcare , currently available to two - year - olds from disadvantaged backgrounds , to all two - year - olds by the end of the parliament in 2020 - with the ambition of achieving it within one or two years			2
