water filling the @entity3 's oceans is older than the formation of the sun , increasing the chances of life emerging among the stars , scientists have revealed			1
the discovery suggests that water may be a common ingredient in the clouds of dust and gas from which solar systems are born , and not ' special ' to our own			0
this has major implications for the likelihood of life being found on exoplanets orbiting stars beyond the sun , according to researchers			0
professor @entity37 , from the @entity38 , said : ' we know that water is vital for the evolution of life on @entity3 , but it was possible that the @entity3 's water originated in the specific conditions of the early solar system , and that those circumstances might occur infrequently elsewhere			1
' by identifying the ancient heritage of @entity3 's water , we can see that the way in which our solar system was formed will not be unique , and that exoplanets will form in environments with abundant water			1
' it raises the possibility that some exoplanets could house the right conditions , and water resources , for life to evolve			2
' the international team of scientists studied ancient ices preserved in comets and asteroids since the early days of the solar system			1
using computer simulations , they were able to show that water in the oceans , meteorite samples and comets bore the chemical fingerprint of formation before the solar system took shape			1
pictured is the @entity77 water vapour has been detected in the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years - or 729 trillion miles - from @entity3			2
the planet is about the size of the gas giant @entity83 , and is the smallest and coldest outside the solar system known to contain @entity87 molecules - the building blocks of life			2
scientists claim the discovery is a leap forward in the study of distant exoplanets that may in future uncover evidence of alien life			0
researchers used a technique called transmission spectroscopy , which measures dips in light as the planet passes in front of its host star to identify the signs of water vapour			0
previously it has only been possible to measure the atmospheric compositions of larger @entity111 - sized extrasolar planets			0
using computer simulations , they were able to show that water in the oceans , meteorite samples and comets bore the chemical fingerprint of formation before the solar system took shape			1
the water contained levels of deuterium - a ' heavy ' strain of hydrogen with extra neutrons in its nucleus - that could only be explained by interstellar origins			0
it meant that at least some of the water in the solar system and on @entity3 pre-dated the birth of the sun. lead author @entity136 , from the @entity137 , said : ' the implication of these findings is that some of the solar system 's water must have been inherited from the sun 's birth environment , and thus pre-date the sun itself			1
' if our solar system 's formation was typical , this implies that water is a common ingredient during the formation of all planetary systems			2
to date , the @entity156 satellite has detected nearly 1,000 confirmed extrasolar planets			0
' the widespread availability of water during the planet - formation process puts a promising outlook on the prevalence of life throughout the galaxy .			0

@entity3 's water may have begun life in the early solar system , says study
this means exoplanets may form in environments with abundant water
the study took a look at ancient ice preserved in comets and asteroids
computer simulations revealed water in oceans and *icy* comets have chemical fingerprint of formation before the solar system took shape
