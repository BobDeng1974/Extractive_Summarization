@entity1 's newborn presidential campaign is reeling from new financial links between her family foundation and companies that benefited from her stewardship of the @entity6			1
on a day when a new @entity8 poll found only 38 per cent of @entity9 believe she is honest and trustworthy , the leading @entity12 candidate for president has a mess to clean up			1
part of it will involve the @entity18 , @entity1 and @entity17 re-filing some of its annual tax returns to correct errors in how it has reported income from foreign governments			0
the murky picture also includes tens of millions of dollars @entity25 collected in speaking fees from companies that saw their fortunes rise because of @entity6 actions while his wife ran the agency			1
he also met @entity44 ( right ) , at the time @entity36 's prime minister , during the visit in one case a foundation run by the chairman of @entity49 , a nuclear energy company tied to @entity36 , gave the @entity52 ' family philanthropy millions while @entity1 's @entity6 gave its stamp of approval to the company 's purchase of @entity9 uranium			1
the @entity36 state atomic agency @entity59 purchased a majority stake in the @entity62 - based company in a years - long process that unfolded from 2009 to 2013 â€“ the same years mrs. @entity1 was @entity9 's secretary of state			1
the executive , @entity64 , gave the @entity17 $ 2.35 million during the same time through his family 's @entity65			1
@entity25 , the former @entity9 president , also received one of his highest speaking fees , $ 500,000 , in june 2010 in @entity42 for addressing an investment bank linked to @entity36 president @entity44 and the @entity70			1
he earned more than $ 100 million for his speeches from 2001 to 2013			0
that number comes from financial disclosure statements filed by @entity1 when she was a @entity9 senator and , later , secretary of state			1
@entity75 businessman @entity64 was only shown as having donated $ 250,000 to the @entity17 , though tax records reveal that his foundation gave millions when his company was being sold to @entity36 an investigation by @entity80 uncovered the connections , based on interviews and public records in @entity75 , the @entity9 and @entity36			1
@entity84 , the former first daughter whose name is now part of the @entity17 's official moniker , defended the philanthropy on thursday in @entity89			2
the @entity18 , @entity1 and @entity91 does ' important ' work and is ' among the most transparent ' of foundations , she claimed during a panel discussion at the @entity94			0
' what the @entity17 has said is that we will be even more transparent , even though @entity99 and others have said we 're among the most transparent of foundations , ' @entity17 , the foundation 's vice chair , said			0
' i very much believe that that is the right policy			0
that we 'll be even more transparent			0
that to eliminate any questions while we 're in this time , we wo n't take new government funding , but that the work will continue as it is			0
' accepting funds from companies tied to foreign governments presents the appearance of a conflict of interest for the @entity17 , since it 's one avenue through which countries could try to influence @entity1 and extract sweetheart deals from @entity116			2
the foundation is also under fire for handing the @entity119 incomplete or incorrect accounting of how much money it received from foreign governments			0
@entity84 defended her family philanthropy on thursday in @entity89 , calling it ' among the most transparent of foundations ' @entity125 reported on thursday that the @entity17 and its associated charities will re-file at least five annual tax returns to correct the mistakes			1
the errors involve under - reporting , over-reporting or misclassifying millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments			0
in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , according to @entity125 , the @entity17 reported to the @entity119 that it received zero dollars from foreign and @entity9 governments			2
that number stood out because it reported tens of millions in foreign government contributions in the preceding years			0
pressure : likely @entity137 presidential candidate @entity136 slammed the @entity52 for ' making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep ' foreign governments had continued to give tens of millions of dollars toward the foundation 's work on climate change and economic development			2
the foundation listed the donors on its publicly available donor lists , but omitted them in its tax filings			0
@entity1 is seeing a flurry of new scrutiny applied to her years as secretary of state now that she has announced a 2016 presidential run			2
her chief female @entity137 rival , former @entity155 ceo @entity136 , said thursday that alleged links between the @entity17 , former president @entity25 's speaking fees and mrs. @entity1 's leadership at @entity158 are disturbing			1
' it 's the @entity25 way : raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep , ' @entity136 said in a statement			2
' now they 're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as secretary of state			0
' the @entity36 uranium story is one piece of a larger puzzle			0
when @entity59 purchased 51 per cent of @entity49 , which controls a reported one - fifth of the uranium made in the @entity9 , the reported $ 610 million sale needed to be approved by a committee of government agencies , including the @entity6			1
@entity177 approved the majority ownership deal in 2010			0
@entity179 , a former assistant secretary of state , was the principal @entity6 representative on the committee , and said that @entity25 did not intervene with his work			0
no one ' has ever produced a shred of evidence supporting the theory that @entity1 ever took action as secretary of state to support the interests of donors to the @entity17 , ' according to foundation spokesman @entity190			2
the @entity17 has become lucrative for one of @entity9 's most powerful political families , with @entity25 receiving $ 26 million in speaking fees from donors to the charity			1
above , @entity25 speaks in january approval of @entity49 's sale helped @entity36 state nuclear agency @entity59 gain control of uranium assets in the @entity9 and @entity201 ( pictured ) he said that is was ' utterly baseless ' to say that @entity25 helped push the deal through while her foundation received a windfall in donations			1
when @entity25 joined the @entity208 as secretary of state , she signed an agreement saying that the @entity17 would not receive money from foreign governments and disclose all donors			2
however , the donations from @entity49 's @entity64 reveal that it was still accepting undisclosed donations from private individuals whose businesses and interests aligned with governments such as @entity36 or businesses			0
sixty companies that lobbied the @entity6 when @entity1 was @entity209 donated $ 26 million to the foundation , at the time run by her husband , according to @entity224			1
the @entity17 only reported that @entity64 gave it $ 250,000 , though tax records reviewed by @entity80 show that @entity64 's @entity65 gave $ 1 million in 2009 , $ 250,000 in 2010 , $ 600,000 in 2011 and $ 500,000 in 2012			1
@entity64 said that his donations were to support his friend @entity227 , who has deep ties to the @entity52 and once benefited from @entity18 's presence on a business trip to @entity201			0
up to $ 5.6 million may have come from other individuals associated with @entity49			0
the revelations about possible connections between the @entity17 and @entity1 's work in the @entity6 come as more information has been gathered about how the charity lined the pockets of one of @entity9 's most powerful political families			1
@entity25 has made a total of $ 26 million in speakers fees from donors to the @entity17 , according to a report in the @entity244			1
the former president has received more than $ 100 million in speaking fees since leaving office , though how much of that was from organizations that also donated to his foundation has not previously been known			1
some of the biggest donors to the foundation are financial institutions @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257 , which personally paid @entity25 $ 3 million in speaking fees			1
then - senator @entity1 listens to a briefing from the @entity177 , the organization where she would later help approve @entity36 's purchase of @entity9 uranium assets @entity25 's trip to @entity201 and its president @entity263 ( pictured ) helped paved the way for a major foundation donor @entity227 to start a booming uranium business there @entity75 businessman @entity227 ( right ) got a sweetheart uranium mining deal from @entity263 in 2008 with @entity25 's help , a year after launching a ' sustainable development initiative ' with the @entity17 ; @entity227 pledged $ 100 million and half his earnings from mining to the foundation his june 2010 speech to leading @entity36 officials at an event for @entity43 netted him $ 500,000			1
@entity25 met with @entity44 , at the time @entity36 's prime minister , during his visit			1
all of the business dealings linked to the @entity17 took place during the @entity208 's ' reset ' in @entity9 relations with @entity36			2
@entity25 also engaged in activities in the @entity284 world not directly tied to his foundation			0
in 2005 he flew to @entity201 with a @entity75 uranium mining financier @entity227 and met the country 's despotic president @entity263			2
@entity25 's appearance is seen as helping @entity227 secure a deal to start his @entity292 uranium company in @entity201 , which would later merge with @entity49			1
@entity227 would donate $ 31.3 million to the @entity17 in 2006 and helped start the @entity293			0
@entity36 would ultimately benefit from the deal and @entity25 's involvement , and was able to secure more uranium production in its own backyard when took majority control of @entity49 in 2010 and 100 per cent control in 2013			1
@entity59 said that it would not export any of the uranium out of the @entity9 , though a rancher at the nuclear material facility in @entity303 said that the uranium is often taken for processing in @entity75			2
news of the @entity17 's ties to uranium executives comes after criticism of the @entity25 's ties to additional eastern @entity312 money , from the @entity314 oligarch that became one of their foundation 's biggest donors			2
@entity318 , the fourth richest man in @entity314 , was found to have done business with @entity321 government despite @entity9 sanctions against the @entity324 country when he sold their oil and gas pipes in 2011 and 2012 , according to @entity326			0
many of the recent revelations have come from a book called ' @entity330 ' , written by investigative journalist @entity331			0
supporters of @entity1 's fledgling presidential campaign say that the book is a partisan conservative attack			0
a spokesman for the campaign said that the @entity49 deal went through the normal approval process and that @entity331 's book is ' twisting previously known facts into absurd conspiracy theories			0
' the @entity177 also includes representatives from most large arms of government , such as the @entity346 , @entity347 and @entity348 .			0
