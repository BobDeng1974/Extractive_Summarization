@entity0 is facing a battle to save his career after being ruled out for the whole of next year with the serious eye injury he suffered last season			1
the @entity8 keeper - batsman , only last week named in @entity11 ’s provisional @entity10 squad , will be missing indefinitely after struggling to regain the vision needed to perform at the highest level			1
it is another harsh reminder of the dangers inherent in cricket , with the sport still reeling from the death of @entity19 after he , like @entity0 , was struck on the head after mistiming a pull shot while batting in a first - class game			2
@entity0 posted this picture on @entity24 just after he had been hit by a bouncer at @entity26 @entity0 is hit in the eye by @entity29 's delivery after it goes through his grille in july @entity0 ’s injury came in july when he damaged his eye socket and cheekbone and broke his nose when a ball from @entity37 ’s @entity29 smashed through his helmet grille			1
he posted horrific pictures of his injuries on @entity24 but was fit enough to resume his career towards the end of the season			0
problems re-emerged during the recent @entity46 domestic twenty20 tournament and he will now undergo further specialist rehabilitation			0
a @entity8 statement admitted that it was ‘ unlikely ’ that @entity0 , 27 , would be fit for the 2015 domestic season while chief executive @entity50 confirmed to @entity51 that ‘ we just do n’t know ’ when the @entity46 - born player would be fit again			1
the @entity8 star charted his original recovery on social media , here giving a thumbs up in hospital @entity0 uses hilotherapy to try to aid his recovery after the operation @entity61 , the new @entity8 director of cricket , admitted the extent of concern over @entity64 when he said : ‘ this is clearly worrying news for @entity0 and his health and well - being are paramount in our minds			1
‘ we will continue to support him during his treatment and rehabilitation and hope to see him return to playing as soon as possible			0
’ @entity0 , who has made 46 one - day international appearances for @entity11 , said : ‘ it ’s really disappointing but my eye is not a hundred per cent and this is critical in maintaining the levels of performance that i expect of myself			1
‘ i need to make every effort to resolve the matter and have the best specialist help in that regard			0
’ @entity0 donned the gloves when @entity11 won the @entity84 in the @entity85 in 2010 the news will further increase scrutiny on the effectiveness of helmets and add pressure on manufacturers to come up with more improvements as they seek to reduce the risks involved in facing a heavy ball propelled at speed			2
and it is a huge blow to @entity8 , who lost @entity99 to @entity100 after plumping for @entity64 as their @entity102 keeper in all cricket last year			0
in the short term @entity0 , one of the most effective @entity84 hitters in the game , has been ruled out of @entity108 ’s @entity107 and has seen any remote hopes he had of featuring in @entity11 ’s final @entity10 squad disappear			2
more importantly , at 27 , he faces a fight to see whether he will ever be able to recover sufficiently to take his place back at @entity113 again .			0
