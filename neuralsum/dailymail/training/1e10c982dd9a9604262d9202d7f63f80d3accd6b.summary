the flu jab will protect just three per cent of patients this winter , health experts warned last night			1
they say the virus that causes the illness has mutated so much that it no longer ‘ matches ’ the current vaccine , which was only developed a year ago			0
the 3 per cent figure predicted by experts at @entity9 would be the worst in at least a decade			1
the @entity10 spends around £ 100million each year on the flu vaccination programme , with each jab costing £ 7.60			1
although it is never totally effective , it usually protects around 60 per cent of patients			2
last night questions were being asked about why health officials did not raise the alarm earlier			1
the flu jab will protect just three per cent of patients this winter , health experts warned last night ( file picture ) researchers at @entity9 assessed the effectiveness of the jab by looking at saliva samples from 1,314 patients with @entity28 found that only 3 per cent had the @entity30 strain of the virus , the remainder had a mutated form			1
yesterday experts blamed flu for a sudden spike in death rates – particularly among the elderly , even though most have the jab every year for free on the @entity10			1
data from the @entity40 shows that just over 25,300 over- 65s died in the last two weeks until january 23 , a rise of 40 per cent compared to the previous year			0
the death toll attributed to flu by the spring is now predicted to be the worst since 1999/2000 , though latest @entity10 figures suggest the season has passed its peak			1
the three - year high last month may have contributed to the recent crisis in @entity51			0
millions of patients have the flu jab every year including certain ‘ at risk ’ groups such as the elderly , pregnant woman , those with underlying illnesses such as asthma and health workers who get it for free			1
in addition , other individuals pay for it privately or receive it from their employers			0
experts are now urging @entity68 to prescribe antiviral tablets – which treat the illness rather than prevent it – to all vulnerable patients as soon as they show symptoms			2
the problem has come about because the vaccine started being developed in february last year , nine months before the flu season typically gets under way in november			0
the @entity10 spends around £ 100million each year on the flu vaccination programme , with each jab costing £ 7.60			1
although it is never totally effective , it usually protects around 60 per cent of patients ( file picture ) experts predicted @entity30 ( pictured ) would be the most dominant virus but it has now mutated it is made up of a tiny amount of the strain of the virus that experts predict will be the most dominant – this year it is @entity30			1
this is enough to kick - start the patient ’s immune system to develop a resistance to the virus			0
but this year , the virus has mutated so it no longer matches the vaccine and the majority of patients are n’t protected			2
experts say the vaccine will still protect against two other strains of flu that could emerge later this year			0
experts hope this year is a one - off and stress that the effectiveness of the jab in previous years shows it is still the best method for preventing flu			2
the 3 per cent figure emerged in a study by @entity9 and published in the journal @entity107			2
professor @entity108 , the country ’s deputy chief medical officer , said : ‘ the latest data show that levels of flu are generally decreasing in the @entity113			0
‘ we do see “ drift ” in the flu vaccine from time to time , but even so , i want to reassure people that it is still the best overall way to protect yourself and your family from flu , along with good hand hygiene			0
' but @entity124 , branded the disclosures ‘ extremely worrying ’ for those who thought they were protected against flu			0
she said : ‘ it beggars belief that health officials were n’t aware just how badly the vaccine was working a long time ago			2
if they did n’t realise the scale of the problem until now they are n’t doing their job properly			0
