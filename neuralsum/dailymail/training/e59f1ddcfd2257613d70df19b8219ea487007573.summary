by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is trying to play catch up to your favorite local cafe by offering ' cold brew ' coffee , a hipper and less acidic alternative to normal iced coffee , to customers in @entity11 - area stores			1
the @entity13 - based giant became famous for introducing specialty coffee to a wider @entity16 audience as it expanded across the country , but on the coffee front the brewing behemoth has been outdone recently by smaller roasters and cafes			0
according to the blog @entity24 , the chain began ' quietly ' serving a ' core @entity26 ' iced coffee prepared on the @entity28 cold brew system in one area around @entity11			1
be cool : @entity2 introduced cold brew coffee , a hip alternative to its normal iced coffee , to its stores with little fanfare according to the system 's instructions , preparing cold brew on the @entity28 takes anywhere from 12 to 18 hours and produces a cup that 's significantly less acidic than regular brewed coffee			1
this method is different than the normal preparation technique for iced coffee , which is brewed hot before being chilled and served over ice			1
@entity45 states that cold brew is just one more way that @entity2 is ' inching into third - wave coffee , ' the umbrella term for increased attention on brewing techniques and specialty coffee			2
@entity2 introduced pour over techniques and clover machines , both of which produce one cup of coffee at a time , in recent years			0
@entity2 was beaten to the punch by a number of smaller - name coffee shops			0
the blog @entity63 says that @entity65 - based @entity64 was selling cold brew in stores and released a bottled version as far back as 2010			2
cool kids : profits for the @entity13 - based giant are up , but coffee-wise it 's being outdone by pretenders from @entity65 , @entity74 and @entity75 there should n't be any reason for @entity2 to panic over being behind : @entity78 says sales at the @entity13 chain are up			0
@entity2 is preparing the cold brew in small daily batches , meaning that for locals need to hustle in for their fix before it sells out .			0

the *company* has not released plans for a wider release of cold brew coffee , which is being sold in @entity11 - area @entity2
cold brew is prepared with grounds *steeped* in cold water for over 12 hours , as *opposed* to normal iced coffee , which is brewed hot then chilled
cold brew is one technique from the ' third wave ' of coffee , which *focuses* on specialized preparation techniques among other *aspects*
