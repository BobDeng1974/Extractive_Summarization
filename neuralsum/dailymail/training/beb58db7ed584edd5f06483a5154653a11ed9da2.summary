environment secretary , @entity0 , has tried to win over a sceptical public claiming the crops are safe eighty - five scientists have joined forces to challenge the claims of biotech giants and the @entity8 government that @entity10 food is safe for humans			1
environment secretary @entity0 , who has responsibility for food and farming , and the industry have embarked on a huge public relations exercise to win over a sceptical public to genetically modified food			1
the campaign is built on an assurance that the food is safe to eat and could defeat a host of ills from malnutrition in the @entity25 to blindness in children			2
@entity10 supporters also insist crops are safe for the environment and to be used as animal feed			2
however , these assurances have been questioned by the scientists , who warn there is a serious lack of independent research into the health effects of @entity10 food			1
studies involving feeding trials with animals suggest eating @entity10 food could cause real harm , such as allergies , inflammation of internal organs and even breast cancer			2
the group has signed a joint statement which concludes : ‘ the claimed consensus on @entity10 organism safety does not exist			0
’ they warn that most of the positive research has been run and paid for by biotech companies such as @entity54 , which have invested millions in trying to get the world to eat their crops			0
professor @entity58 , of @entity59 , said : ‘ there is no consensus amongst scientific researchers over the health or environmental safety of @entity10 crops and foods , and it is misleading and irresponsible for anyone to claim that there is			0
@entity71 protesters attacking a field of genetically modified crops which scientists warn are not safe for humans to eat ‘ many salient questions remain open , while more are being discovered and reported by independent scientists			1
’ mr @entity0 has often cited the situation in the @entity79 as evidence that @entity10 causes no health risk			0
he argues that the fact people have been eating these foods for almost 20 years demonstrates they are safe and last week he dismissed opponents as ‘ wicked ’ .			0
