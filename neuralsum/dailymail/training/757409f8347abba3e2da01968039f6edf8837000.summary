by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:49 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:46 est , 24 december 2013 speaking out : @entity3 has revealed that she was subjected to abuse from viewers of @entity6 a finalist in @entity6 says she was told to ' know her place ' by viewers who abused her online while the hit @entity11 series was on air			1
@entity3 blames the simplistic way producers portrayed her for the harsh reception - and suggests that women were more vitriolic than men towards the female contestants			1
the 30 - year - old psychologist is not the first of this year 's finalists to complain about her treatment by viewers - @entity23 said she received an ' extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile ' on social media during the show , whose fourth series concluded in october			1
miss @entity3 and @entity30 reached the final of the baking contest , judged by @entity33 and @entity34 , but were beaten by eventual winner @entity35			1
speaking to @entity36 's @entity37 , miss @entity3 revealed that she was sent dozens of message accusing her of being arrogant and responding badly to criticism			2
she said that viewers told her : ' i was too self - satisfied , i was too confident and cocky and cocksure and i was n't showing enough vulnerability , i was n't showing enough deference , i was n't being gracious enough			1
' i read comments which said i should know my place			0
that was really quite an interesting response to what i went into thinking was just a baking show			0
' despite suggestions of a misogynistic bias against the three women who made it to this year 's final , miss @entity3 said that many of the most virulent abuse came from female viewers			1
contestants : miss @entity3 , left , reached the final of this year 's show along with @entity23 , centre , and eventual winner @entity35 , right popular : the @entity11 hit has made national stars of its two judges @entity33 and @entity34 ' i would say the harshest critics of the guys on the @entity6 would be women sat on their sofas talking to each other saying " she looks a bit fat in that " or " i do n't think she 's done a very good job of her jam tarts			1
" i think it 's women who are actually the harshest critics			2
' there 's a danger when you talk about a gender bias , you imagine it 's men attacking women , whereas i think actually women can be the real damage to a kind of perceived sisterhood that never existed			2
' she added : ' what you got was a kind of condensed , slightly two - dimensional representation of what happened			2
nothing was fictionalised , but it was n't fully nuanced			0
' i was presented as kind of uber - confident and uber - competent , which is probably just not human			1
that becomes a bit of a problem in terms of viewers watching it because it becomes a little bit unnatural and there was a little bit of repercussion for me in terms of that			2
' ' misogyny ' : miss @entity23 , known for her emotional persona , has previously described the abuse she received from online viewers miss @entity3 said that some viewers may have seen her as particularly confident thanks to her training as a psychologist - but she insisted that her career in fact made her more vulnerable			1
' one of the producers did say , " you do n't seem to be too riled by some of the things the judges say , you do n't seem to get very upset about things			0
is it something about your job which means you have a thick skin ? '' ' actually , i think it 's completely the opposite			0
i 'm a psychologist , part of my job is about taking criticism every single day			0
i sit in supervision and my work is taken apart line by line verbatim in sessions			0
i 've sat in therapy and i 've looked at myself and i understand myself			0
' it 's about not just pushing criticism away in a kind of defensive stance			0
it 's about partly understanding what 's being picked up on and , painfully , is there any truth in it , is there any reality in it and if so can you deal with that ? ' in a blistering article written just after the end of the show , miss @entity23 - known for her emotional persona on the show - hit out at the ' personal vitriol and misogyny ' which she said she had received from some viewers			1
' despite the saccharine sweetness of the @entity6 , an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators , both on social media and in the press , ' she wrote .			0

@entity3 , 30 , says producers portrayed her as more self - confident than she actually was
suggests that women viewers were more vitriolic than male fans
