when @entity1 left for @entity2 in such a dreadful hurry this week , it was almost enough to make the residents of @entity5 choke on their lobster risotto , drop their flute of fizz , rip the @entity10 shades from their eyes and demand answers			1
almost , but not quite			2
@entity5 is a strange place			1
for many locals it will have passed without notice that the rest of @entity19 football has turned with intrigue towards the principality and events at the club owned by @entity24			2
was it a cash - flow issue that forced the @entity28 oligarch to cool on his investment and sell star assets @entity1 and @entity32 as they prepared for a return to the @entity35 for the first time in nearly a decade ? that would be understandable as he fights an astonishing divorce settlement of £ 2.7billion			1
on his way out : @entity1 has been loaned out by @entity5 to @entity41 for a £ 6m fee @entity43 striker : @entity1 was @entity5 's poster boy and main source of goals or was he simply getting bored ? was it a whim ? had he taken offence that his desire for full citizenship has yet to be granted ? was it something more sinister ? was @entity53 going bust ? @entity5 's manager @entity55 quietly fumed			1
this was not what the brochure had promised when he replaced @entity59 in june			0
fans demanded refunds on shirts and season tickets bought before the exodus of players and change of recruitment policy			1
@entity5 reneged on a pre-contract deal to sign @entity70 goalkeeper @entity69 and took @entity71 on loan from @entity73 instead			1
months after reports of an audacious plot to sign @entity76 , the targets look very different			2
@entity78 , who arrived with @entity32 from @entity79 last year in a £ 60million package , was rumoured to have stormed out of the training ground when it became clear @entity1 was off to @entity41 , irrespective of the fact the @entity85 's commitment has been in question since his return from serious injury			1
elsewhere , around @entity90 , there was a sigh of disappointment that the only true challengers to unfeasibly rich champions @entity94 had chosen to scale back and leave @entity95 hopelessly uncompetitive			0
all smiles : @entity1 with @entity41 assistant manager after signing for the season at @entity99 expensive : @entity100 is going through an eye - watering £ 2.7m divorce with wife @entity103 @entity55 's team have four points from four games and their quest for a first @entity90 title since 2000 appears fanciful			1
loyal supporters feel betrayed and angry , but these feelings will not reverberate in the streets as they might if this script had unfolded down the coast in @entity114			0
resident millionaires — tennis players , racing drivers , actors , music stars and the like — have higher profiles than the footballers in a town busily preparing for its annual yacht show			2
what do they care if @entity1 deserts them to rub shoulders with skinny wannabes from @entity124 and @entity125 or fading rebels from the @entity127 ? as @entity5 has always been quite unique , a football club set in a tax haven of 36,000 people , the world 's second smallest independent state , participating in the @entity90 league before crowds averaging 11,000 on a poor pitch built on a car park			1
the appeal has never been its passion for football			0
' i was young and i enjoyed it for a while , ' said former @entity144 striker @entity143 , who spent three years there , after moving from @entity146 in 1987			0
' it was completely different from the intensity of @entity146			0
i could walk in the streets with my kids and there was no fuss			0
we were playing good football in a good team under a young @entity156			0
we won the title and it was a great experience			0
' the lifestyle is beautiful , but in the winter we could play in front of two or three thousand			0
for big players , it 's not quite what you want			1
i left after three years			0
the upside , of course , for the big stars , is that it 's tax free			2
' also gone : @entity32 left @entity5 for @entity170 for £ 63m after a superb @entity171 quietly fuming : this is not what new @entity5 boss @entity55 expected when he took over the principality ruled by the @entity176 dynasty charges no income tax and its private banking industry has long been the focus of international concern			1
for five years until 2009 , it was on an official blacklist of uncooperative tax havens , but has always denied running a regime tolerant to money laundering			0
@entity24 was already a resident in december 2011 when he bought 66.67 per cent of the crisis club wallowing near the bottom of @entity188 , having slumped from its high of the @entity35 final in 2004			2
head of state @entity192 applauded the deal			2
' the agreement opens a new page in the history of the football team so dear to the principality , ' said the @entity192			0
' i hope the club can rediscover its former prestige , which made it one of the jewels of @entity5 's sporting life			1
' others wondered aloud if this sugar - daddy takeover could work in the absence of a genuine fan - base , with @entity210 's @entity209 ( @entity209 ) rules swinging into action			2
would it soar like @entity214 , or crash like the failed experiment at @entity217 ? @entity24 's personal fortune built on potash offered its own insurance			2
it was estimated by @entity222 this year at £ 5.3bn and he remains seriously rich , even after his costly divorce			0
within 18 months of the takeover @entity5 were back in the top flight and assembling a formidable squad			1
they finished runners - up behind @entity94 last season , but the plans were already starting to unravel			2
after @entity1 's exit on monday , the club 's vice-president @entity231 stressed it had never been the plan to continue last year 's spree , but he admitted three factors had forced the @entity28 to ' edit the project '			2
royal assent : @entity192 ( right ) was enthusistic when @entity100 took over as owner of @entity5 no cashing in : revenue did not explode at @entity5 after the signings of @entity1 and @entity32 firstly , he said , there was @entity209 and the penalties imposed by @entity210 on @entity245 and @entity94 for failing to comply			1
then , there was the £ 41.5m paid to the @entity90 league to settle a dispute and allow as @entity5 to continue trading from their tax - free state while competing against clubs bound by @entity90 's taxation laws			1
' they have always been a thorn in @entity90 football , ' said @entity143			0
rival clubs finally demanded action when @entity90 proposed a 75 per cent top - rate of income tax and a compromise was found , which included this one - off payment by @entity5			1
initially the principality was going to pay half , but @entity24 has ended up footing the bill			0
thirdly , revenue did not explode as hoped after big names such as @entity1 , @entity32 , @entity78 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 arrived			1
' we thought that with the stars we signed , sponsors would come , ' said @entity231 , in an interview with @entity275			0
' we have realised that will take time			0
' @entity24 insists his divorce will not influence club policy			0
a @entity281 court ordered him to pay £ 2.7bn , plus property in @entity281 worth £ 88.5m , to wife @entity103 after more than 20 years of marriage			0
her lawyer called it ' the most expensive divorce in history , ' although how much of the figure she actually receives is open to question			0
he has challenged the ruling and a complicated trust structure transfering assets to the couple 's two daughters were not part of the ruling and the actual settlement is set to be the subject to ongoing legal action for many years			2
some suspect this has influenced his club policy , while others think he has taken offence because his rescue act at @entity5 has not been rewarded with the ultimate social upgrade from his @entity306 — a 10 - year residency pass — to a full @entity309 passport			1
complicated : the deal to take @entity78 ( left ) to @entity5 was tangled up in third - party ownership only the @entity192 can grant full citizenship and very few of these passports exist ( an estimated 6,000 in 2009 )			1
it is a matter of acceptance and his relationship with the royal family is thought to be crumbling			0
@entity192 left early as @entity5 lost their opening game of the season at home to @entity323 — an act widely interpreted as a protest at @entity24 's failure to reinvest profits from @entity32 's £ 71m sale back into the team			1
it is not quite so simple			0
the deals to bring @entity1 , @entity32 and @entity78 to the @entity332 were entangled with third - party ownership and as such the profits were not all for the club			1
even so , there is no hint @entity24 is about to quit			0
he has just bought a new £ 180m apartment overlooking the harbour , the latest addition to a property empire that includes a £ 56m pad in @entity343 - bought by his daughter @entity344 - that broke @entity347 real estate records			2
' who knows the future ? ' said @entity231 in @entity275 , but he insisted the owner will be back in his seat in the stands for the @entity35 opener against @entity354 on september 16 , and remained ambitious and committed to an ' intelligent long - term project ' albeit one that is slightly ' less glorious ' than before			0
@entity231 told the @entity357 : ' since becoming president of @entity5 in 2011 , mr @entity24 has overseen the club 's promotion to @entity95 and qualification for the @entity35 – both achieved at the first attempt			1
he remains 100 percent committed to the @entity5 project			1
' in light of events over the past year that could not have been foreseen , some of the tactics and the timeframe for the project have been amended			0
but the ultimate goal remains exactly the same : to develop @entity5 into a competitive @entity19 club and one of the world 's elite sporting brands			1
' golden oldie : @entity269 ( right ) joined @entity5 from @entity170 in 2013 for his career swansong crowd - pleaser : the silky @entity268 ( right ) was also brought to the principality a year ago @entity383 ' sensational ' @entity382 spending not slowing down			1

@entity5 's manager @entity55 fumed at the *decision* to let him go
fans demanded refunds on shirts and season tickets bought before the exodus of players
@entity32 was sold to @entity170 earlier in the *summer*
