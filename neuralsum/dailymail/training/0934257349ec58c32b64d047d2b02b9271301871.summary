president @entity1 's nominee to serve as the @entity3 surgeon general , a 36 - year - old physician who has attracted criticism for his anti-gun advocacy , complained to a newspaper in 1994 that ' society 's preoccupation with firearms ' comes from ' fiery gun battles ' on saturday morning cartoons			1
dr. @entity12 , who founded doctors for @entity1 in 2008 – a group that later changed its name to ' @entity16 – was a graduating high school senior at the time , one of several valedictorians the @entity18 interviewed			1
' @entity12 , 16 , of @entity19 , takes television cartoons to task ' for ' the growing problem of kids and violence , ' according to the @entity18			2
' today , a typical elementary student wakes up on saturday mornings to fiery gun battles , explosive scenes of terror and the violent decimation of the " bad guy " – all this in a children 's cartoon , ' @entity12 said then			1
' with such destructive influence , society 's preoccupation with firearms and brutal methods of conflict resolution is no surprise			1
' this nominee seems much more devoted to politics than to patients , ' sen. @entity70 said monday night on the @entity74			0
' i know there are a number of senators who are up for re-election who are probably not going to want to vote for somebody who is this committed to taking away our @entity48 rights , ' said @entity70 , a medical doctor himself			2
he noted that dr. @entity85 , a @entity86 who served an attorney general under president @entity88 , has written to president @entity1 to say that @entity12 is unqualified			1
critics of @entity12 have pointed to his @entity92 feed as evidence that he would be more political activist than doctor - in - chief if he were confirmed			1
following the december 2012 massacre of 26 students and teachers at an elementary school in @entity100 , @entity101 , he tweeted : ' @entity103 press conference disappointing but predictable - blame everything in the world except guns for the @entity100 tragedy			0

' @entity12 has never called for knife - control , despite the frequency of slicings and stabbings on the @entity122 ' ' itchy and @entity124 ' episodes president @entity1 nominated @entity12 in february , shortly before another nominee -- tapped to lead the civil rights division of the @entity128 -- crashed and burned @entity129 settled dozens of disputes with guns -- the pretend kind -- over a 17 - year period that insistence that firearms belong in willy - nilly national discussions about public health , and not in the relatively more steady world of constitutional law , is making gun rights advocates see red			1
' historically , the surgeon general of the @entity3 has been a position with the purpose of educating @entity3 so that they may lead healthier lives , rather than advancing a political agenda , ' @entity142 @entity64 sen. @entity64 wrote in a february letter to @entity151 @entity150 majority leader @entity149			2
