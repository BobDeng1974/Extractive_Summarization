by @entity0 bleak future : sir @entity2 said big - budget programmes would lose funding on and off screen , he has been responsible for some of the most enduring @entity8 programmes of the past 60 years			1
but sir @entity2 fears that quality programming could soon become an endangered species because of the huge rise in on - demand internet services and digital networks			1
the veteran wildlife presenter , who was controller of @entity16 in the 1960s , said the boom in satellite tv and online services such as @entity21 – which has almost 50million subscribers – is leading a decline in viewing figures that will result in budget cuts			1
he fears that output such as big - budget adaptations of @entity28 plays will eventually only appear on niche networks which do n’t have mass audiences			1
speaking at an event to mark the 50th anniversary of @entity16 , the 87 - year - old was shown a series of clips highlighting its major cultural programmes , including a production of @entity28 ’s @entity39 by the @entity40			1
the presenter of the renowned @entity44 series said : ‘ i think in another 25 years , or another fifty , that kind of stuff you see there … i do n’t believe people will be producing @entity28			1
' i really do n't think they will , because the television audience is becoming split and split and split			1
‘ i saw figures the other day and @entity44 got 17million viewers on the first showing and has had hundreds of millions since			1
' you could sink money into making a production like that because you know what ’s going to happen			1
acclaimed : sir @entity2 with mountain gorillas in @entity44 in 1979 , after he was @entity64 a @entity8 impartiality review that gave its coverage of the @entity68 and immigration a clean bill of health was ‘ seriously flawed ’ , a report has found			1
last year ’s @entity73 report – commissioned by the @entity74 – found its coverage was ‘ broad and impressive ’			2
but a fresh study published by respected think - tank @entity77 yesterday shed doubt on its methodology , saying a series of basic errors meant it was ‘ not independent and not worth the paper it was printed on			2
’ @entity77 identified several flaws in the @entity8 report ’s research methods and questioned the independence of its author @entity89			2
the 63 - year - old – who is the former chief executive of @entity91 – has spent years making programmes for the @entity8 through his independent production company			2
it said : ‘ in particular , its analysis of output on @entity98 ’s today programme was severely limited because it monitored less than half of the today programme and then focused rigidly on the 7am to 8.30am block and ignored saturday ’s broadcasts altogether			2
’ yesterday , mr @entity89 defended his report , saying : ‘ i regard this as an ill - founded smear and the authors should be ashamed of themselves			2
’ a @entity74 spokesman said : ‘ we stand by the report and the conclusions that the @entity74 drew from it , and we do not recognise this inaccurate characterisation of it			2
‘ the approach @entity89 took in reaching his conclusions is consistent with that taken by all previous authors of impartiality reports for the @entity74			0
’ ‘ but every time you get another satellite on the air , you are diminishing the audience			1
you wo n’t get audiences of 17million again			1
' so eventually you wo n’t get the budget to make those sorts of programmes			0
’ ‘ so what will happen ? well , i suspect that specific organisations will decide they are going to circulate natural history programmes or @entity132 documentaries , or operas or @entity28 in a different kind of way , and it wo n’t be available as it is at the moment , and should be at the moment , to the universality that comes from a licence			0
’ as controller sir @entity2 was responsible for commissioning programmes such as @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , life , one pair of eyes , @entity150 and @entity151 , a ground - breaking 13 - part series on the history of @entity155 art. he later went on to present the world - renowned life series for the @entity8			0
recent years has seen a huge increase in on - demand online streaming services such as @entity21 , @entity160 and @entity161			0
@entity21 now accounts for more than half the video streamed over the internet and has almost 50m subscribers			0
it now produces its own series like @entity166 and @entity167 is the @entity168			0
sir @entity2 ’s comments were echoed by the @entity8 ’s creative director @entity170 , who said : ‘ the great thing about @entity173 television is that the traditions that broadcasting has emerged from are traditions of intelligence and inclusivity			1
‘ those values have been shared by the whole of public broadcasting			0
now we are living in a different world			0
this is a very tricky moment we are talking about			0
you ’ve got @entity21 , you ’ve got @entity160 , you ’ve got what might seem like benign predators who are no longer as benign			0
‘ they ’re all public companies now and they ’ve got very vast pockets			0
‘ the @entity8 is about to do a huge @entity28 season thanks to the licence fee , and the public consensus needs to support the idea of these things if you still want to see the kind of things that we have valued for a long , long time			0
’ it was earlier this year that the @entity8 announced it was closing youth - orientated arts channel @entity197 following a series of cost - saving measures			0
the channel will be broadcast only online from @entity201 2015			0
the @entity8 veteran said : ' every time you get another satellite on the air , you are diminishing the audience '			1
