the @entity1 team are set to reunite in a surreal sci - fi comedy film			1
former member @entity3 has written a script which involves a hapless teacher suddenly given @entity7 - like powers by a council of odd aliens – and he is lined up to direct it			1
but although @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity3 himself have all agreed to voice the aliens , their colleague @entity11 has refused to sign up			1
tensions : from left , actors @entity14 , @entity13 , @entity3 , @entity15 and @entity11 , pictured in 2009 , could be getting back together for a new film his stance is thought to have deterred investors in the film , titled absolutely anything – and could rob each of the other @entity26 of a £ 3.5 million payday			1
producers , who include @entity3 ’s son @entity30 , have raised only £ 10 million of the £ 30 million needed , and are said to be desperately keen to talk @entity32 round			2
but it seems unlikely , after @entity11 wrote on @entity34 : ‘ these @entity1 reunion rumours are just b * * * * * * s. some greedy b * * * * * * producer in @entity39 floating an idea			1
’ if the film gets off the ground , it would also star @entity44 as the voice of a talking dog – while @entity48 heartthrob @entity47 and former bond girl @entity49 have reportedly been approached for leading roles			0
new film : a 44 - page document has been aimed at potential backers for the film a 44 - page document aimed at potential backers with at least £ 1 million to invest suggests that @entity11 could still be involved			1
however , he has been steadfast so far – and explained on @entity34 that he has not turned down a @entity1 reunion but a film that just happens to have the involvement of his former colleagues			2
he wrote : ‘ i ’m not “ not in a @entity1 film ”			2
i ’m not in a @entity3 film			2
if you ca n’t see the difference then you should probably lie down for a bit			0
’ in the pitch , @entity3 writes : ‘ it ’s a funny script so i guess the idea is to make it into a funny film			1
it has a laugh rate comparable to @entity75 or @entity76 so it is my sacred duty to make it funny on film ! ’ it would not be the first time @entity11 has shunned a reunion , as he was the only ex-python not to contribute to last year ’s film @entity83 , about @entity84 – their colleague who died in 1989			2
however , he earns millions from the @entity1 legacy as creator of the hit @entity90 musical			0
@entity11 has joked in the past that there would be a reunion just as soon as @entity84 ‘ comes back from the dead ’			0
but he has tried to reunite the group before , mooting a sequel to @entity75 in 1998 that @entity13 rejected			0
instead he wrote @entity90 , which only caused more tensions in the group after he complained about the royalties he had to pay his former colleagues			0
@entity13 , who has made no secret of the fact he needs cash to fund a £ 20 million divorce , dubbed his fellow comic ‘ @entity111 ’ in reference to @entity108 ’s reputation for breaking up @entity109 , when he tweeted : ‘ i see @entity111 ’s been moaning ( again ) , about the royalties he had to pay the other @entity26 for @entity90			0
apparently he paid me “ millions ”			0
’ later , he added : ‘ actual rough figures last time we checked – @entity111 $ 13m , @entity14 $ 1.1m , the others just under a million each			0
’ hilarious : @entity3 says that the new film script has a laugh rate comparable to 1979 's @entity76			1

@entity3 has written a script for a new film called absolutely everything
it appears that @entity11 is the only @entity1 not to have signed up so far
his stance is thought to have deterred investors from getting involved
