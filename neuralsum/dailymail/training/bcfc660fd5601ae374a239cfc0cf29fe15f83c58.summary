@entity0 changed his @entity2 line - up for the 28th time in a row , dropping @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , but this time nobody was complaining as they racked up a big victory to ease through to the @entity12 quarter - finals			1
the @entity14 coach put out an entirely different side to the team that saw off @entity17 last weekend and the reserves responded impressively , to offer @entity20 's side the chance of revenge in the next round			1
two brilliant first half goals from @entity25 and @entity26 set @entity2 on their way , before @entity28 and @entity29 added two more , and their team did the footballing equivalent of putting their feet up and having a doze in front of the fire , gently stirred by the odd @entity36 effort whizzing over the crossbar			1
@entity25 ( second left ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring at the @entity40 stadium @entity26 points to the skies after scoring @entity2 's second goal during the @entity12 tie @entity28 , who was also on the scoresheet , vies with @entity36 's midfielder @entity45 during the easy win @entity36 : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 80 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 69 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 63 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60			1

@entity0 had given his fearsome strike - force the night off , with only two regular starters in the squad - @entity77 and @entity78 on the bench			2
the likes of @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 were also saved from making the 330 - mile trip down the coast to the small city of @entity97			2
@entity2 were , of course , five goals up from the first leg , so if they had managed to get eliminated it would n't just have been @entity5 and a few worried fans wanting to see the back of the coach			1
one thing you ca n't accuse @entity0 of is ignoring the youth , with @entity70 and @entity74 making their debuts here , the latter the seventh youngster @entity0 has bestowed the honour upon in his short time at the club			0
instead of the stars , we got to see a few of the starlets , with @entity118 dazzling in fits and starts on the wing , and midfielder @entity70 and forward @entity72 also starting			0
although the latter had plenty of game - time earlier in the season , it 's dried up of late as @entity2 's main strikers have started to click			1
@entity29 should have opened the scoring after seven minutes , with right - back @entity67 heading the ball down to the left - back , just a few yards out , but he fluffed his lines			1
the @entity132 is more accustomed to scoring screamers from long - distance , so he probably was n't used to being in such a position			2
that excuse was scuppered a few minutes later , when he launched a rocket from thirty yards , which lurched off into the stands			2
@entity55 , on loan at @entity36 from @entity140 , showed he was n't afraid to put his foot in , with an early foul on @entity143 to break up @entity2 's play			1
he has n't been a consistent starter for @entity36 this season , but he 's put in some reasonable displays			0
@entity26 was in fine form and showed why several clubs are keeping tabs on the @entity151 @entity2 forward @entity118 tussles with @entity36 's @entity153 forward @entity59 @entity0 has taken @entity2 to a point of leaders @entity156 and into the last eight of the @entity12 after 20 minutes @entity73 zipped down the right and the cumbersome @entity52 hacked him down			1
the veteran defender was lucky that he did n't see red , but @entity36 were punished , brutally , by @entity25			2
the @entity160 has n't picked up many accolades for his grace or accuracy on the field , but there was nothing wrong with his searing 30 - yard free kick which fizzed into the top right corner			0
@entity36 were n't too pleased and decided to copy @entity17 's tactics from last sunday night , which saw @entity20 's side try to kick @entity2 to pieces			1
just like in that game , it did n't work , and the @entity2 scored another brilliant goal after 40 minutes			2
@entity67 laid the ball across to @entity26 , around 25 - yards out , and he shifted it onto his left foot and then swerved it magnificently into the top left corner , leaving poor @entity47 with no chance			2
and before long , it was three			0
the beleaguered @entity52 knocked down @entity72 in the box and a penalty was awarded			0
@entity28 , another victim of the @entity6 - @entity7 triumvirate , was given the captain 's armband for the first time in his @entity2 career , and also the responsibility for converting the spot - kick			1
he did , stroking it into the bottom left corner , sending @entity60 the wrong way			0
@entity73 continued to impress with his trickery on the wing in the second half , with an impressive blend of speed , power and skill			0
@entity52 , meanwhile , started to make amends for his poor defensive work , whipping in a brilliant ball which was missed by @entity57 at the back post , with @entity66 's goal gaping			0
@entity71 vies with @entity36 's midfielder @entity45 and @entity54 during the @entity12 victory @entity36 's goalkeeper @entity47 vies with @entity2 's forward @entity28 as he crosses into the box @entity36 's forward @entity209 gets to grips with @entity25 @entity29 got his goal in the end , nodding home from a @entity68 cross in stoppage time to make it 4 - 0 on the night and an astonishing 9 - 0 on aggregate			1
including @entity2 's previous games against @entity219 , they have scored 21 goals in the last two rounds of the competition			1
pulling the strings for @entity2 throughout was @entity71 , who may be the eventual heir to @entity92 's throne			2
there 's the danger that he 'll be seen as an @entity0 man , but he 's shown enough in the games so far this season to suggest he will eventually thrive at the top level			0
and in the years ahead , we 'll be hearing more about @entity74 too			0
the young @entity232 replaced @entity73 - wearing the @entity233 30 , the same @entity5 did when he made his debut - and hit the post with an almost carbon copy of @entity26 's shot for the second goal			1
but however impressive the youth players were at the @entity241 , it will be all change when @entity2 head to the @entity243 on sunday night to face @entity244			2
@entity245 will come @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			0
and back will come the pressure , as they try to hound down @entity156 at @entity250 's summit .			0

already 5 - 0 up from the first leg , @entity2 rested many of their first team
it did not take long for class to tell with @entity25 opening the scoring after 21 minutes
@entity26 and @entity28 ( penalty ) added further goals with @entity29 nodding a late fourth to complete the stroll
@entity2 's win sees them drawn against @entity17 in the quarter - finals of the competition next week
