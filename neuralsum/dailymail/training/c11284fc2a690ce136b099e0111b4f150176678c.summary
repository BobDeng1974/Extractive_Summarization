another member of the paedophile network , @entity31 ( right ) , who had nearly four million images of child abuse when he was arrested , was jailed for seven years in july last year @entity6 police have joined forces with @entity9 and @entity10 investigators to smash a paedophile ring which streamed live child abuse from the @entity4 ( file picture ) the @entity39 has said it is investigating what it calls ' a significant and emerging threat ' , particularly in developing countries			1
@entity43 , from the @entity39 , said : ' this investigation has identified some extremely dangerous child sexual offenders who believed paying for children to be abused to order was something they could get away with			2
' being thousands of miles away makes no difference to their guilt			0
in my mind they are just as responsible for the abuse of these children as the contact abusers overseas			2
' protecting the victims of abuse is our priority and that means attacking every link in the chain , from dismantling the organised groups who are motivated by profit through to targeting their customers			1
' so far 15 children aged six to 15 have been rescued after being identified as victims			1
in some cases their own relatives sold them for abuse			1
in the @entity6 five of the 17 suspects arrested have been convicted , nine investigations are ongoing , one will face no further action and two are dead			1
the @entity39 has said it is investigating what it calls ' a significant and emerging threat ' , particularly in developing countries			0
the inquiry was prompted when @entity11 visited registered sex offender @entity19 and began tracking the international abuse network from obscene videos they found on his computer			2
he was paying to view live sex abuse and planned to move to the @entity4 to open an internet cafe , but instead was jailed for eight - and - a - half years in march last year			1

' thanks to this joint operation , children have been rescued from a living nightmare ' - @entity103 , from the @entity10 @entity104 the use of web cams in the developing world to stream live abuse is a significant and emerging threat , claim the @entity39			1
@entity110 , an @entity39 spokesperson said : ' i think this is an emerging threat			0
it ’s the first investigation of live streaming of extreme abuse , and it ’s only scratching the surface			1
' we hope there will be more arrests in the future			0
there ’s a number of people who have been identified			0
' there ’s an element of extreme poverty and areas where people are more vulnerable to abuse			2
it appears to be going both ways - families who are poor sometimes exploit their own children			2
this is a world wide issue			0
' extreme poverty , the increasing availability of high - speed internet and the existence of a vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organised crime groups exploiting children for financial gain			0
' @entity103 from the @entity10 @entity104 said : ' thanks to this joint operation , children have been rescued from a living nightmare			2
' the group responsible for these heinous crimes mistakenly believed that they could use technology to avoid detection , but they were wrong			0
' we will continue to work tirelessly with our international law enforcement partners across jurisdictions and national boundaries to protect children anywhere in the world and bring criminals to justice regardless of where they live			0
' @entity161 , of the @entity162 , added : ' every day @entity162 officers work with state and international counterparts to combat child sexual exploitation and to bring offenders to justice			0
' the use of online media to drive these types of crimes is a sinister development			0
to target the most vulnerable members of the community in this way can not be tolerated in any society			0
