the washing machine - sized @entity1 probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet @entity5 on 12 november 2014			1
but after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface , the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power			1
now , as the comet approaches the sun and solar rays recharge @entity1 's batteries , @entity12 mission manager @entity11 tells @entity17 he is confident of finding the probe soon - but it will be a race against time to get it working again			1
he warned that once the comet begins heading away from the sun in august it will enter hibernation again - but this time for good			1
rosetta mission manager @entity11 told @entity17 he is confident of making contact with @entity1 on comet @entity5 soon ( approach of lander on 12 november shown )			1
the probe has been silent since it ran out of power in november , and @entity32 scientists in @entity33 recently failed to make contact last week , experts at the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) abandoned an eight - day attempt to find the probe - the first attempt at trying to restart communications since it went dark			1
@entity1 only had a limited battery supply when it landed , lasting just 60 hours before it ran out of energy			2
the @entity12 probe , which was carrying @entity1 , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity46 and @entity47 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity5			1
it chased comet @entity50 through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the @entity1 lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet			1
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			2
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			0
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
it managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power			0
@entity12 is continuing to orbit and study the comet			0
scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity46 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			2
but it is covered in solar panels and , as the comet approaches the sun , it is expected to get enough power - 19 watts - from its panels to make contact with the orbiting @entity12 spacecraft			1
there will be several windows of opportunity as @entity12 makes its way around the comet for the two unmanned spacecraft to talk to each other			0
the next of these will be on 13 april			2
making contact will enable scientists to get @entity1 to continue the groundbreaking science it managed to perform in its brief operational time on the surface - and it will also allow @entity12 to pinpoint its location			1
speaking about the attempt to find the probe last week , mr @entity11 told @entity17 : ‘ we were trying to see if the lander would wake up and , at the same time , we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation			1
‘ we do n’t yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander			0
’ the main issue at the moment is that , for the lander simply to wake up , it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45 ° @entity130 )			2
but to start communicating with @entity12 again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power			0
it may have already reached the former level , which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we wo n’t hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter			0
this image sent back from @entity1 revealed its precarious position on the comet			2
it appears the probe is partially wedged against a cliff , with some of its solar panels shrouded in darkness			0
but this did not stop it from completing more than 90 per cent of its science goals in 60 hours of operation on the surface @entity1 , pictured left by @entity12 on its approach to comet @entity156 on 12 november , needs 19 watts of power in order to communicate with @entity46 through @entity12			1
mission manager mr @entity11 , pictured right , said they had already sent commands to the lander , some of which it may have carried out the landing of @entity1 on @entity156 was a groundbreaking moment not only for @entity32 , but for spaceflight as a whole			1
it marked the first time a probe had successfully landed on a comet			2
shown are some of the team celebrating when news of the successful landing was received back at mission control in @entity179 , @entity33 ‘ it ’s a very complex configuration , ’ explained mr @entity11			1
‘ the lander has to be able to communicate with the orbiter , and at the same time we are hoping to have enough energy and solar illumination for the lander to wake up			0
’ at the next attempt , @entity11 said there was a ’ 50:50 chance ’ they would hear something from @entity1 , but even if that attempt is unsuccessful he is very confident that we will have heard something from @entity1 by the time @entity156 makes its closest approach to the sun - known as perihelion - in august			1
by this time , temperatures will almost certainly be sufficient for its solar panels to generate enough power for the probe to continue performing experiments on the surface			2
when it wakes up , mr @entity11 said his team would ‘ check the situation of the lander and all its units , try to understand what has happened since november , and then as quickly as possible start the long term science phase			1
’ the goal of this long term science phase is to ‘ understand better the comet ’s surface , the area where the lander has landed , ' he added			0
‘ if the lander wakes up , i ’m sure we would try to use all or most of the instruments			0
’ shown here are @entity12 and the @entity1 lander , in the centre , before they took off from @entity46 in 2004			0
@entity1 ’s power system included a non-rechargeable 1,000 watt - hour primary battery and a secondary 140 watt - hour battery , charged by the 24 square feet ( 2.2 square metres ) of solar panels on its exterior scientists are desperate to study the jets that are being emitted by the comet in more detail - one is seen in this @entity12 image - as it approaches the sun. and @entity1 will play a big part in increasing our understanding of how this process takes place , if @entity32 is able to wake it up in a reasonable amount of time but while they are confident @entity1 will wake up , scientists will be hoping it happens sooner rather than later as it will not be able to operate indefinitely on the comet			1
after august , @entity156 will begin its journey away from the sun , and temperatures on the comet will begin to drop			2
‘ after the summer we start getting more away from the sun , so there will be a point where it will happen again , and then the lander will go into hibernation , ’ mr @entity11 said			1
ultimately , once the influx of solar rays drops sufficiently , @entity1 will turn off for good			0
even though the comet has a relatively short orbital period , 6.45 years , it 's unlikely @entity12 and @entity1 will survive long enough to continue communicating with @entity46 on its return			0
some comets ' orbital periods lasts thousands of years			0
in addition , perhaps the most interesting time to study the comet will be as it approaches the sun , and ice on its surface begins to vapourise into gas			0
if @entity1 can study and observe the comet on the approach , it could provide some fascinating insight into what happens to a comet during this phase .			0

rosetta mission manager @entity11 told @entity17 he is confident of making contact with @entity1 on comet @entity5 soon
the probe has been silent since it ran out of power in november
@entity32 scientists in @entity33 recently failed to make contact
but mr @entity11 said they have a ' 50:50 ' chance of making contact on 13 april
however , they want to find it before the comet leaves the sun in august
after this , the probe will eventually run out of power - this time forever
the team wants to perform as much science as possible before then
