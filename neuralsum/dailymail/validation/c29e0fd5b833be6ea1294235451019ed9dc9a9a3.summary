never mind the typical attractions that will attract hordes of tourists this @entity3 , how about heading to @entity4 to look at @entity6 cube wrappers or packages of @entity8 ? or travelling to @entity9 to visit a second - floor council flat that houses the world 's only baked bean museum ? we may be a small island but we do brilliantly bonkers attractions remarkably well			1
here are some of the quirkiest attractions in the @entity18			2
the man behind it is @entity20 , who has amassed a treasured collection of over half a million items , although only about 12,000 are displayed here			1
his light bulb moment came in 1963 when the obsessive collector was 16 and had just finished some @entity37 and @entity38 's and @entity40 ginger nuts			1
his thinking was that if he threw away the wrappers a small fragment of history would be consigned to rubbish			1
the consumer historian has since become an authority on the history of supermarket brands and written twenty books on the subject			1
as well as biscuit tins and soap powder expect nostalgic toys , games and posters			2
the light bulb moment came in 1963 when the obsessive collector was 16 and polished off some snacks captain @entity59 has curated a collection of bean tins , money boxes , posters and other one - off memorabilia @entity65 where : @entity67 , @entity9 congratulations are in order for the 10 - year anniversary of the world ’s only museum dedicated to baked beans			1
captain @entity59 ( previously @entity59 - he changed his name by deed poll ) installed the exhibit dedicated to @entity77 in his @entity67 council flat back in 2005			2
from a second - floor flat on the @entity81 seafront the bean enthusiast has curated a collection of bean tins , bean money boxes , posters and other one - off memorabilia			2
the walls , ceiling and curtains are all orange and , when the opportunity arises , he dresses up in a cape , green pants , orange jumpsuit and painted face to become his alter ego , captain @entity59			2
visits are by appointment only and while there ’s no fee , you may be asked to make a charitable donation			2
@entity103 has a loo with a see - through waste pipe so you can watch the progress of excrement @entity103 where : @entity110 in the 19th century this is where @entity110 ’s sewage was pumped to be treated			0
today its exhibits include the history of terminology for bodily waste written onto a toilet door and a loo with a see - through waste pipe so you can watch the progress of excrement ‘ from flush to drain ’			0
the world 's longest colour pencil measures 26ft and is located at the @entity126 @entity126 where : @entity128 , @entity129 if you thought pencils were boring , visit this museum in @entity129			1
you ’ll find the world ’s longest colour pencil ( 25ft and 11 inches ) and a pencil used by @entity136 pilots with a hidden map and compass to navigate them out of war - time situations			1
other joys include the history of graphite and discovering how factories get colour inside a pencil			1
the @entity147 have been held once a year in @entity148 since 1980 @entity147 where : @entity148 this only happens once a year but it is well worth the wait			1
competitors gather in an attempt to charm as many worms from the ground as possible in a set time			0
the sport was officially born on 5 july 1980 when a local @entity162 farmer ’s son , @entity160 , charmed 511 worms out of the ground in half an hour			0
the competition has been running ever since and a regulatory body has been formed to enforce 18 rules and prevent cheating			0
the event has a history of people cheating by hiding worms up their trousers and sprinkling them on grass there ’s even such a thing as the @entity176 of @entity177 and @entity178			0
quite necessary , as it turns out , as the event has a history of people hiding worms up their trouser legs then sprinkling them onto the grass and even chopping worms in half to boost their final worm - count			0
the date for this year ’s event has yet to be released but it typically falls in june			1
the cement menagerie was sculpted by local builder @entity190 to amuse his disabled son @entity193 where : @entity195 just off the @entity197 between @entity198 and @entity199 there ’s a spectacle not to be missed			0
the cement menagerie was sculpted in the 1960s and ' 70s by a local builder called @entity190 to amuse his disabled son @entity204			0
the 300 - odd charming statues of animals and humans include models of zebras , sheep , @entity211 on his camel , and @entity213			0
