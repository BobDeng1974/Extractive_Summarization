by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter in 1997 , the towers reached international fame as @entity5 and @entity6 in the blockbuster film ' @entity8 ' blew up the top of the towers , which in the movie were two alien spaceships			2
they were also seen in the 2010 hit ' @entity15 ' they were designed as sleek , space - age visions of the future : three towers topped by flying - saucer - like platforms , and a pavilion of pillars with a suspended , shimmering roof that was billed as the " @entity24			1
" now the structures are abandoned relics , with rusted beams , faded paint and cracked concrete			1
the giant metal globe to the right , the @entity39 , has been restored as the fair 's 50th anniversary approaches later this month , the remains of the @entity33 are getting renewed attention , from preservationists who believe they should be restored , and from critics who see them as hulking eyesores that should be torn down			1
neither option would come cheap : an estimated $ 14 million for demolition and $ 32 million to $ 72 million for renovation			1
' it is the @entity51 of @entity52 , ' says @entity53 , who 's making a documentary about the pavilion in @entity52 ' @entity56 , comparing it to a remnant of the @entity58 that was also threatened with demolition before it was saved			2
@entity6 ( @entity60 ) and @entity5 destroy a spaceship that flew down from the top of one of the @entity36 towers in ' @entity8 ' @entity6 ( @entity60 ) and @entity5 in a promotional photo for @entity66 designed by famed architect @entity68 , the @entity33 structures debuted with the rest of the @entity36 on april 22 , 1964 , and quickly became among its most popular attractions			1
visitors rode glass ' @entity74 ' elevators to the observation deck of a 226 - foot tower — the highest point in the fair			0
the two shorter towers , at 150 and 60 feet , held a cafeteria and a vip lounge			0
the pavilion 's 16 , 100 - foot - tall concrete columns supported what was then the largest suspended roof in the world , a 50,000 square - foot expanse of translucent , multicolored tiles			0
on the floor below was a $ 1 million , 9,000 - square - foot terrazzo tile map of the state , with details of cities , towns and highways			1
the space - age towers , topped by flying - saucer - like platforms , and a pavilion once called the ' @entity24 ' are off - limits to the public @entity101 and other decay plagues both the towers and the former @entity33 in the years after the fair , the pavilion was used as a music venue for such acts as @entity107 , the @entity108 and @entity109 in the ' 70s , it became a roller skating rink until the collapse of the ceiling tiles , leaving only bare cables behind			1
the towers , while still structurally sound , were abandoned as observation decks long ago for safety reasons			0
although occasionally opened for tours , the towers and pavilion — the last major structures still standing from the @entity36 that have not been preserved — have largely served as a stoic landmark for travelers on the @entity123			1
two pad - locked gates — one chain - link , one metal — keep the @entity24 shuttered			0
this 1965 file photo shows the observation towers and @entity33 at the @entity129 in @entity33			1
this 1965 file photo shows the @entity33 and towers at night the @entity33 was one of the most popular attractions at the 1964 @entity36 ' it should be called the " tent of yesterday , " ' says @entity134 , who lives near the park			1
' this is not the @entity137 , it 's not the @entity139 , it 's not the pyramids			0
... so what 's so special that we should keep it ? ' at the heart of the debate is the cost			0
while the city 's @entity149 commissioned studies on the cost of scrapping or renovating the complex , it is still unclear where that money would come from and , if restored , how the structures would be used			2
if the money comes through , work on the city - owned pavilion could begin as early as next year once officials make a decision			0
@entity163 president @entity162 has formed a task force dedicated to preserving the pavilion , noting that other structures from the @entity36 have been saved , most notably the 12 - story - tall metal globe called the @entity39 , the @entity169 and the @entity170			1
among the ideas are to convert the towers once again into observation decks or an elevated garden or even a platform for bungee jumping , with the open - air pavilion turned into a performance space with a removable stage and bleachers			0
while that debate plays out , a small group of @entity36 buffs has formed to repaint the pavilion so it can be open to the public briefly for an april 22 anniversary event			1
the towers will still be off limits			2
' i just loved this pavilion , ' says 63 - year - old volunteer painter @entity191			0
' and as the years went on i saw it decay and it just like tore my heart			2
' @entity134 , the @entity52 resident , argues that nostalgia is fine , but the cost of saving the complex is just too much			0
' urban parks are the backyards for people who do n't have them — so they can sit on the grass , look at trees , flowers , water , ' @entity134 says			0
' they do not want to look at glass , steel and cement structures			2

estimates to renovate the remnants of the 1964 @entity33 run from $ 32 million to $ 72 million , not *including* demolition costs
structures , which were designed by renowned architect @entity68 , were among most popular attractions of the @entity129
site has been off limits to the public for years
50th anniversary of the opening of the 1964 @entity36 is on april 22
