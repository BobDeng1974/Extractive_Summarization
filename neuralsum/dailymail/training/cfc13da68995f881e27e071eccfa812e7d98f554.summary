' the evidence i have heard makes it plain that even from the time she tried to end her relationship with you , a combination of that kindness , her affection for you and the domination you exercised over her made it impossible for her to do so			0
' the evidence also shows that whilst you are , as i recognise , a man of virtues , you are also a man who needs to be in control of those you are close to and you are a man with quick temper			0
' the judge said the break - up ' can not have come to you as a bolt @entity263 '			0

you stabbed her many , many times			2
' she tried her best to defend herself against the brutal attack and - on your own account - begged you to stop			0
i accept that this was not premeditated			0
' the fact remains that this was a ferocious attack on a defenceless , vulnerable woman , a woman much smaller than you and in her own home , with a knife			0
' your reaction was not to seek any sort of help but instead you cleared up the scene of this dreadful event and manufactured a false account of what had happened			0
' you will remain in prison for a minimum term which i must now set			0
the sentence on you is imprisonment for life , with a minimum term of 20 years , less the time you have spend in custody on remand			2

he would n't allow her to leave and he made sure of that by brutally stabbing her to death			0
' @entity8 's behavior was not as a result , as he tried to portray in court , loss of control at suddenly finding out about the new person miss @entity9 had met			1
