by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 4 april 2013 only when one of the most senior church leaders in @entity3 applied some pressure did the newly - appointed @entity6 boss finally issue a statement denying he was a fascist			1
for three days he had steadfastly refused			2
for three days both @entity8 and his employers at @entity6 had responded to anyone who dared question the @entity13 's appointment with a misguided mixture of anger and hostility			1
when @entity17 resigned as the football club board 's vice-chairman on sunday night , citing @entity8 's ' past political statements ' , @entity6 failed to even mention the departure of the ex-foreign secretary in the statement that amounted to their first bungled attempt to bury the controversy			1
when the former @entity44 manager was then asked , in a separate media briefing , if he would meet members of the @entity41 who have been so offended by his politics , his response was : ' why should i ? ' even when the leader of @entity49 said a lack of clarification could result in a serious fracture in their relationship with the club , there appeared to be a distinct lack of action			1
but when the @entity28 joined the chorus of disapproval by writing an emotional open letter to @entity8 yesterday , the 44 - year - old finally attempted to draw a line under the issue with a statement on the @entity6 website			1
he said : ' i have clearly stated that i do not wish to speak about matters other than football ; however , i have been deeply hurt by the attacks on the football club			2
' this is a historic , proud and ethical club and to read and to hear some of the vicious and personal accusations is painful			2
i am an honest man , my values and principles come from my family and my upbringing			2
controversial : do @entity8 's appointment has caused uproar among fans and those opposed to fascism ' i feel that i should not have to continually justify myself to people who do not understand this , however i will say one thing only - i am not the man that some people like to portray			1
' i am not political , i do not affiliate myself to any organisation , i am not a racist and i do not support the ideology of fascism			1
' i am a football man and this and my family are my focus			2
now i will speak only of football			2
' ' i am not political , i do not affiliate myself to any organisation , i am not a racist and i do not support the ideology of fascism			1
i am a football man and this and my family are my focus			0
now i will speak only of football ' @entity8 , @entity6 manager despite his protestations , there is strong evidence linking @entity8 to fascism , but until yesterday the @entity13 had steadfastly refused to be drawn on his political beliefs			1
but the letter from the very reverend @entity108 proved impossible to dismiss			1
a @entity6 supporter , the @entity28 wrote of how @entity8 's appointment ' raises very difficult questions '			1
he said he was ' the child of a jewish war refugee who got out of @entity114 and came to @entity115 just in time ' , some of whose ' family and friends perished in the @entity120 death camps ... so i find your self - confessed fascism deeply troubling			1
' @entity123 was nearly the undoing of the world , ' he added			0
' @entity125 , who you say has been deeply misunderstood , openly colluded with it			0
' he pointed out that the @entity3 has been ' fertile ground ' in which the @entity130 has sown ' the seeds of its pernicious and poisonous doctrine ' and warned : ' unless you clearly renounce fascism in all its manifestations , you will be associated with these toxic far - right tendencies we have seen too much of in this region			2
' down to work : @entity8 took charge of his first training session at @entity6 today @entity142 , the leader of @entity49 and a @entity144 member , had spoken on tuesday			1
' @entity6 is a private business and we would n't be dictating to them about their morals and ethics , ' he said			1
then he added : ' but we would expect to hold them high if they want to continue working with us			0
' this is an unprecedented situation			0
we have just given a significant grant to the @entity153 , which puts into context where the city council stands			0
the people of the city would expect us to take a moral stance on this			0
' last night the @entity41 showed the first signs of seeking a truce with the club 's new coach			0
@entity164 , the general secretary of the @entity41 , said : ' we think this ( @entity8 's statement ) is the solution to the problem			1
it takes a brave man to put forward what he has , given the past few days			0
we hope it 's sincere			0
' if it is then we can put to bed our issue and let @entity8 get on with what he 's been brought here to do			1
the club have come around and we hope there 's cognisance of people 's feelings in future before making appointments			0
' dear @entity8 , we have never met , and i am the first to admit that i do n't know very much about football			1
you do , and i respect that			0
however , i hope you will allow me to say something about your appointment as manager at @entity6 as personally as i can			1
my relationship with the @entity6 goes back a long way			1
i married into a family of fervent lifelong @entity6 supporters			1
my wife and i got engaged on cup final day 1973 , figuring that if @entity6 won her father would say yes to anything and if they lost , he would be past caring			1
all these years we have wanted @entity6 to do well			1
we have been glad when it did , and sad when it did n't			2
we know how much its football success has meant for the people of @entity6 and the @entity3 who are rightly proud of your new club			1
but today i am wondering what to do			0
your appointment raises very difficult questions			1
you see , i am the child of a jewish war refugee who got out of @entity114 and came to @entity115 just in time			1
some of her family and friends perished in the @entity120 death camps			0
so i find your self - confessed fascism deeply troubling			2
@entity123 was nearly the undoing of the world			0
it cost millions of innocent lives			0
@entity125 , who you say has been deeply misunderstood , openly colluded with it			0
you are said to wear a tattoo dux which speaks for itself			0
this all adds up to what i find baffling			0
you say that you are not a racist , but it needs great sophistication to understand how fascism and racism are ultimately different			1
i can promise you that this distinction will be lost on the people of the @entity3 where the @entity130 is finding fertile ground in which to sow the seeds of its pernicious and poisonous doctrine			0
you did not necessarily know this before you came			0
but i believe that unless you clearly renounce fascism in all its manifestations , you will be associated with these toxic far - right tendencies we have seen too much of in this region			2
at your press conference today , you had the chance to do this , to say in so many words that you have been misunderstood ( just as you say @entity125 was )			0
you were asked where you stood on fascism , but declined to give an unambiguous response			2
one sentence is all that it would have taken			0
i 'm genuinely perplexed as to why you did n't take the opportunity that was handed to you			1
maybe your minders told you to stay on - message			2
but do n't you see that it is no answer to plead that this press call was about football , not politics			2
where a @entity260 club is concerned , you ca n't ever separate the two			2
politics and high - profile sport , like religion , are about the whole of life			0
to say otherwise may be convenient , but it 's naive			0
@entity260 players and managers are big role - models for the young			0
is fascism what you or @entity6 want our children and teenagers to admire and emulate ? and if this does n't trouble you personally , should it not trouble those who appointed you ? @entity283 now stands to suffer loss of support as well as see its standing and respect damaged not just in this part of the world but internationally			1
its reputation has been hard won			0
i am just one of thousands who would be sad to see it squandered			0
please tell me how to go on supporting the @entity6 with a good conscience , even from the sofa , because believe me , i want to			1
please tell me that i have misunderstood , or missed some fundamental issue here			0
i am simply telling you with a heavy heart that it feels hard at the moment to stay loyal			0

@entity28 @entity108 pressured new @entity6 manager

said he was ' child of jewish war refugee who got out of @entity114 in time '
@entity8 later stated : ' i 'm not a racist and do n't support fascism ideology '
