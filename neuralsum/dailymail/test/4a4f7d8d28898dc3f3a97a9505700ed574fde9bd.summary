his voice cracked with emotion at times and in the next breath he laughed at questions and joked with his boss , @entity7 sporting director @entity6			1
in short , @entity9 ’s farewell press conference was much like his seven years at the club : engaging , compelling and infused with passion			1
@entity9 is leaving @entity7 after seven seasons in which he has won two @entity14 titles , the @entity15 and reached the @entity17 final , in 2013 at @entity18			1
wednesday was not quite ‘ auf wiedersehen ’ as there are eight more matches of the season to play			0
manager @entity9 announced he would be leaving @entity7 at the end of the season @entity7 ceo @entity24 , @entity9 and @entity6 of @entity7 were present for the press conference at @entity26 on wednesday photographers snap away at @entity9 as journalists gather during the announcement of his @entity7 exit yet an era is coming to an end and not just at @entity7 , but – and this is tribute to the charisma he has evoked during his time there – in @entity38 football			1
like @entity39 and @entity40 , @entity9 has elevated himself into the realms of the cult manager			1
he is distinct in that he is much more open than @entity39 and seemingly much less calculating than @entity40 , though that in itself is , of course , a calculation			0
though there is much more to @entity7 than just @entity9 , at times it seems that it has been his sheer force of personality which has carried the club			1
@entity9 was emotionally charged during the press conference as he could n't resist showing his sadness but @entity9 also had moments where he laughed along with his boss @entity6 during the press conference @entity7 celebrate in front of their fans after winning a league match against @entity58 in 2011 there are many reasons why @entity7 have captured the imagination of fans across the world and especially in @entity64 : there is the extraordinary atmosphere of the @entity26 and the 82,000 fans ; there are the season tickets available at £ 160 ; the membership structure which allows fans a say in the running of the club ; the little ritual at the end of the game where the players gather in he centre circle , join hands and thank the fans			1
they came to represent everything the @entity84 is n’t			1
@entity7 : @entity86 league champions : 2010 - 11 , 2011 - 12 @entity86 cup : 2012 @entity17 runners - up : 2012 - 13 @entity89 : @entity86 manager of the year : 2011 , 2012 @entity92 coach of the year runner - up : 2013 and then there were the players , like @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , electrifying the @entity17 with their energy and verve			1
but it was @entity9 who was the public face of a club , the embodiment of all that			2
he was a journeyman football from @entity107 , a second - rate lower league team when he played for them			0
only when he managed them did they become a @entity14 force , qualifying for the @entity111 , a track record which eventually earned him the @entity7 job			1
the club was emerging from bankruptcy when he arrived and he has helped to transformed them into one of @entity38 ’s elite football institutions			0
and whenever they have lost key players – @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity96 , @entity97 – it seemed to make no difference			0
the team just took stock and rolled on			0
it seemed @entity9 alone could keep driving the model ever upwards and onwards			2
except this season the momentum ground to a halt			0
in february they were bottom of the @entity14 and relegation loomed			0
they have recovered and are tenth but were dumped out of the @entity17 by @entity135			0
@entity9 claimed today that he is not tired and that he does n’t require a sabbatical			1
but it was hard to avoid the conclusion that the pressure of trying to keep up with @entity140 as they cherry picked his best players had finally proved too much			0
@entity9 ( left ) stands alongside @entity143 boss @entity142 during his days as @entity107 manager , where he built the foundations of his reputation after guiding them into the @entity111 after winning the @entity14 in 2011 , @entity9 celebrates with @entity7 fans as he holds the trophy but @entity9 would fall one step short in winning the @entity17 as his @entity7 team lost to @entity140 in the 2013 final at @entity18			1
here he stands with @entity153 following the loss ‘ this was n’t a calculated decision , it was n’t planned it ’s not tactical , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ it ’s just that i simply believe that it ’s right and important that we can announce this today so we can be up front and begin to make a logical plan to bring this to an end			0
’ there is another side to @entity9 , of course			2
he could match @entity40 for haranguing referees and has been known to go into full tantrum mode on the touchline			0
and his stylised open - ness is n’t for everyone			0
he met with @entity175 officials when the club were considering replacements for @entity178 ; they opted for @entity179			2
it will be interesting to see whether @entity175 will now give @entity9 a second chance			1
@entity9 has in the past been linked with taking over from @entity182 ( right ) at @entity183 as the duo shake hands before a @entity17 tie at the @entity187 last november as he barks instructions from the touchline , @entity9 's emotional grasp of the game makes him ideal for the @entity84			1
the @entity7 boss shows his fury after his side fall behind against @entity195 in september @entity182 was less than amused when he compared @entity183 to an orchestra playing a ‘ silent song , ’ adding : ‘ i prefer heavy metal			1
’ it came at a time when @entity182 was under pressure , an older man who seemed to be struggling to keep up with the new wave ; @entity9 knew how to make the point			2
in many ways he does seem made for the @entity84			2
his capacity to embrace a club emotionally makes him the thinking man ’s @entity208			0
the sheer relentlessness of his teams and their work - rate means he would have no problem passing the @entity84 ’s ‘ foreigner test ’ otherwise known as wet , windy night at @entity215			2
‘ what i love is fighting football , ’ @entity9 once said , explaining that in @entity86 they even call this ‘ @entity64 ’ football			1
‘ rainy day , heavy pitch , everybody is dirty in the face			0
’ it is @entity9 ’s mantra too			2
he clearly wo n’t lack for offers			0
and wherever he goes , you can expect @entity9 to be the centre of attention .			0

@entity7 manager @entity9 will leave post this *summer*
@entity9 ready to take another job with no sabbatical
emotional grip of game makes him ideal for the @entity84
