@entity0 looks set to join @entity1 this week from @entity2 for a reported £ 16million , according to reports in @entity4			1
the two clubs remain locked in talks ahead of the prospective move , but the @entity9 hierarchy are confident off thrashing out a deal for the highly - rated defender			1
the 25 - year - old was in impressive form for @entity14 during the tournament in @entity16 , and that has attracted interest from new @entity1 manager @entity19			1
it later emerged that @entity36 left @entity1 's tour of the @entity38 for ' general business reasons '			0
less than 24 hours after telling @entity1 fans new signings would be coming to @entity9 this summer , the club 's executive vice-chairman decided he would head back to the @entity44 on monday night			1
@entity36 left the club 's tour last summer because of what was described at the time as ' urgent transfer business '			0
but this time , @entity1 insist @entity20 's departure from the four - match tour is due to ' general business reasons ' and is not due to a specific imminent transfer			2
with both @entity54 and @entity55 departing the club this summer , @entity1 are in desperate need of some experience at the back and despite being just 25 , @entity53 will provide just that after playing at the highest level domestically and internationally for many years			2
unless a late twist puts the deal into jeopardy , @entity0 will join the likes of @entity65 and @entity66 at @entity9 , as @entity26 looks to build a side capable of challenging for major honours			0
quality : @entity53 would be a superb addition to @entity26 's side crucial : hummels will be sorely missed at @entity2 if he leaves @entity74 will continue to spend - @entity20			0

the @entity25 defender looks set to join new @entity1 manager @entity19 at @entity9
the 25 - year - old had an impressive tournament in @entity16 as the @entity81 won the @entity24 for the first time in 24 years
@entity84 agreed for the highly - rated centre - half *believed* to be around £ 16million
