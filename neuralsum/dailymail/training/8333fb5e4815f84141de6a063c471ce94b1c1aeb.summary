by @entity0 for @entity1 to many of us , @entity3 's iconic layered haircut in her role as @entity5 on friends is now synonymous with @entity11 style - unless , of course , you 're too young to to remember the show			1
that 's exactly what 22 - year - old singer @entity14 realized after she shared a photo of herself with fans on @entity18 , showing off her new haircut that resembled the character 's famous ' do			2
but when she captioned the image ' the @entity5 is real ' , her young fans were left positively bewildered , with some leaving hilarious comments asking who in the world @entity5 is			2
get the reference ? @entity27 @entity14 shared a photo of her new ' the @entity5 ' haircut on @entity18 ( pictured ) , butshe was left feeling old when her young fans had no idea who she was talking about confused identity : many of her 326,000 - plus followers were left positively bewildered , with some leaving hilarious comments asking who in the world @entity5 is ' who the f * * * is she ? ? ? ? ' wrote one of her fans			1
' who is rachel ? ' demanded another			0
and perhaps the most hilarious response came from one of @entity49 's fans who seemed convinced she had solved the mystery			1
' she means ratchet , d * * * * * * , ' she wrote confidently			1
even @entity54 's younger sister @entity55 , 14 , was left bewildered by the reference			0
in another post , @entity49 shared a screenshot of a text sent to her from we ca n't stop singer			0
the screenshot shows how @entity54 texted the haircut photo to her sibling , and she responded : ' who is rachel ? ' iconic : @entity3 became so well known for her layered chop in her role as @entity5 on friends that the cut quickly came to be known as the @entity5 generation gap : clearly @entity49 's fanbase is too young to remember the show , which aired its final episode in 2004 cracked it : perhaps the most hilarious response came from one of @entity49 's fans who seemed convinced she had solved the mystery			1
' she means ratchet , d * * * * * * , ' she wrote the final episode of @entity84 aired in 2004 , when @entity55 was just four years old , so his confusion is somewhat understandable			1

@entity49 captioned the photo of the text conversation : ' call me grandma , ' expressing how old the responses made her feel			0
not a clue : even @entity54 's younger sister @entity55 , 14 , was left bewildered by the reference @entity49 and @entity54 are currently on tour together , along with @entity102 and @entity103			2
the pair struck up a friendship in 2013 and have been close since			0
' [ @entity54 's ] obviously way bigger and all eyes [ are ] on her , ' @entity49 has previously said of the star			2
' but i feel like we ’re kind of going through a similar thing where everyone ’s trying to say that we ’re trying to make ourselves objects , but really , everyone else is making it more like that - sensationalizing sex and reading into things			0
it ’s nice to have someone that gets it			0
' the gang : despite changing her hairstyle multiple times throughout the ten seasons of friends , @entity3 just ca n't stop being associated with the @entity5			1

in the @entity11 , @entity3 became so well known for her layered chop in her role as @entity5 on friends that the cut was *dubbed* the @entity5
one of @entity49 's fans seemed convinced she had solved the mystery , *writing* : ' she means ratchet , d * * * * * * '
