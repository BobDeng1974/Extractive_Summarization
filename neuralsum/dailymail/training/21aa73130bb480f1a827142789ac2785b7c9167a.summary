pictured : mr @entity8 with his two daughters and his wife tragic accident : one of the zorbing operators holds the sphere securely as the path it is meant to travel down stretches out ahead the so - called ' orb ' was supposed to come to a halt at the bottom of a gentle snowy piste , designed for the sport , which originates in @entity37			1
but in a terrifying accident filmed by the victim 's friends , it lurched first to the right and then to the left			1
as he got into the giant ball , an unnamed friend - who filmed the horror - is heard saying : ' @entity8 , you 'll be like @entity48 in the @entity50 movie ! ' unknown to come : the pair set off on their journey as they are rolled down the slope by the operators bouncing ride : the giant sphere bounces down the path as the pair spin around while harnessed into place an instructor is asked how far the ' orb ' can go , replying ' not that far ' and explaining there was a man lower down the mountain ready to catch it if it went off track			1
but as it is pushed down the slope , a man 's voice is heard saying : ' oh f * * * , it 's gone in the wrong direction again			1
' suddenly the male voice screams : ' hold it , hold it ! hold ! ' then he says : ' ah well , it 's ok , it 'll stop by itself			2
' the ball crashes through rocks and teeters on the edge of ravine - before disappearing from view , over the cliff			2
uncontrollable : the ball rolls to the bottom of the hill where people are waiting , but then suddenly veers off to left panic : as the massive sphere rolls across the path a figure can be seen desperately chasing after it desperate : when the ball rolls over the side of the slope it starts to gather momentum and turns the friend filming the death ride plunge asks : ' what 's going on there ? ' the voice replies : ' nothing			2
' but then calmly adds : ' a catastrophe			2
' at this the footage stops			2

speed : although the ball slows at a bump - it is not clear from the video which it is - it then tips over and speeds up fatal : in the final shot of the terrifying video the ball can be seen spinning out of control down a steep incline his companion survived			1
