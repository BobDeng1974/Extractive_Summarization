by @entity0 published : 02:32 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 20:31 est , 10 october 2012 attending the opening of the @entity4 's new £ 100m facility yesterday , the @entity1 made sure to dress to impress			1
with the horror of those topless photos still no doubt looming large in her mind , @entity1 must have been keen to put on a brave face - and show as little flesh as possible			2
and so it was : that high - necked wool coat , buttoned up all day without so much as a hemline or collar of a dress beneath revealed			2
those black opaque tights and knee - high boots - it was a wonder she did n't wear gloves and a crucifix			0
her homegrown @entity36 girl style , which has hardly changed since her @entity37 days ( it 's just a sight more polished now , and the shops she uses have changed ) is traditional and demure			0
good quality coat , boots , sensible heel			0
the funnel neckline on @entity1 's coat ( it can also be folded down to be worn for a more traditional single - breasted look ) - meant she did n't need to worry about what she wore underneath - easy			1
her hair was blowdried into the bouncy waves she has made her signature look since she was propelled into the public eye			0
accessories were kept simple : her sapphire engagement ring , and at her ears , discreet drop earrings			0
@entity1 's coat - the £ 325 @entity25 from a previous season , was styled with the £ 65 mock croc betony belt , also from @entity27 - giving the duchess a smart , cinched - in silhouette - and putting paid to the pregnancy rumours that constantly crop up			1
nipped in : @entity1 wore the coat with the £ 65 betony belt by @entity27 ( from the 2009 collection ) , giving her a neat silhouette natural beauty : @entity1 , who famously does her own make - up , kept things simple with a nude lipgloss , gently shaded eyebrows and a dark brown eyeshadow and liner			1
her earrings were simple amethyst and diamond drops by @entity74			0
on her hand was her stunning sapphire engagement ring @entity1 wore a pair of earrings thought to have been personally customised for her by jeweller @entity74			1
the @entity81 fist wore a similar pair in citrine and diamond ( £ 1,990 ) last @entity85 - thought to have been a gift from @entity87 - and later had a pair commissioned using amethyst instead			2
a similar pair with more diamond detailing at the clip is on @entity74 's website ( www.kiki,co.uk ) for £ 2,200 and it 's last appearance ... @entity95 in 2011 for a pre-church walk on the estate deja vu : christmas day , @entity99 2011 : @entity1 had recently purchased the @entity25 coat from @entity27 , which comes from the store 's 2010 autumn / winter collection versatile : the @entity25 coat can be worn with the funnel neck up , as @entity1 chose to do today , or down for a traditional single - breasted appearance - but wearing it up means @entity1 did n't have to worry about what went underneath classic : @entity1 cinched in her coat with the betony belt , £ 65 , @entity27 , bought from the 2009 collection			1

@entity1 accessorised coat with £ 65 betony belt , also from @entity27
previously wore coat , from @entity27 's 2010 collection , for christmas day walk at @entity99
