it is an incredibly rare phenomenon - and the shot of a lifetime			0
a researcher at the @entity5 telescope control center in the @entity5 desert captured this amazing image of a rainbow high over the @entity10 desert			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) lies some 2900 metres above sea level close to @entity5			1
@entity13 , a researcher at the @entity5 telescope control center in the @entity5 desert captured this amazing image of a rainbow high over the @entity10 desert			1
high on the @entity16 plateau in the @entity17 , the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , together with its international partners , is operating the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) — a state - of - the - art telescope to study light from some of the coldest objects in the @entity24			1
this light has wavelengths of around a millimetre , between infrared light and radio waves , and is therefore known as millimetre and submillimetre radiation			0
@entity5 comprises 66 high - precision antennas , spread over distances of up to 16 kilometres			1
this global collaboration is the largest ground - based astronomical project in existence			0
the rainbow was captured by @entity39 employee @entity13			2
this rare rainbow appears over the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) @entity11 ( @entity41 ) , which lies some 2900 metres above sea level close to @entity5			1
the @entity11 is n’t just a location for operating the giant @entity5 ; it is also where new technologies are assembled , integrated , and verified before they are transported to their final destination on @entity16			1
the technology has to be assembled and tested at the @entity11 because the air is much denser there than on the plateau , and workers can complete their tasks without the adverse health risks associated with working at high altitude			1
the telescope itself is high on the @entity16 plateau in the @entity57 and is a state - of - the - art telescope to study light from some of the coldest objects in the @entity24			2
this light has wavelengths of around a millimetre , between infrared light and radio waves , and is therefore known as millimetre and submillimetre radiation			0
@entity5 comprises 66 high - precision antennas , spread over distances of up to 16 kilometres			1
this global collaboration is the largest ground - based astronomical project in existence			0
the secret to @entity5 's incredible resolution comes from two factors : height and distance			1
the observatory 's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft ( 5,000 metres ) above sea level			1
this is far above most of @entity85 's atmosphere and water vapour , which obscures observations			0
astronomers working in @entity5 's facility at 9,500 feet ( 2,900 meters ) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays			1
with all the antennae working in unison as a giant telescope , the observatory will provide astronomers with a window into the early universe			0
the rainbow was captured at the @entity5 telescope control center , where operators control the ' time machine telescope high in the mountains			1
this is where cosmic secrets wait to be discovered , said project director @entity106 , who added @entity5 is poised to reach its full potential next year the $ 1.6 billion telescope , which began full - scale operation in march , has already spotted galaxies expelling gas and a star formation near the centre of the @entity115 's supermassive black hole			1
it also has captured the first image of an icy ring around a distant star			2
by collecting radio waves rather than optical light , @entity5 can look through the dense dust clouds of deep space			2
this will give astronomers a glimpse of galaxies from just after the @entity128			0
it can also look at how individual stars and planets are formed			0
this could shine a light on our creation as it is believed the elements spewed out by dying stars went on the seed the sun , the planets and , eventually , humans			0

the system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas			0
when the latest array is finished , there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 16km ( 9.9m ) apart			0
the antennae capture astronomical signals from the sky individually , then combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information about where the signals come from			0
researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us , but on a universe - size scale			0
this high - resolution not only lets @entity5 observe young planetary systems , but also pin down hydrogen and life - building blocks in gas clouds			2
the array can also track the evolution of galaxies .			0
