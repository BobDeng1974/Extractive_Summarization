by @entity0 @entity3 's @entity2 will start mass production of @entity6 first smartwatch in july , and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in october , it has been claimed			1
rumours still differ as to whether the watch will be round or rectangular			1
it could also come in both mens and womens sizes , will help track user 's health			1
pictured is a concept design of what the @entity23 may look like speculation around @entity6 's @entity23 began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013			1
@entity30 websites reported in december 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip - maker @entity32 on a wrist - worn gadget			0
it was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use @entity36 to communicate with other devices , including an @entity38			0
other rumours suggest the @entity23 will feature @entity41 voice controls that let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			1
the watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			1
in july last year , reports in the @entity52 said @entity6 was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its @entity23			0
it is claimed @entity6 will produce upto 5 million of the gadgets per month			0
the production will be a boost to @entity2 , given that its work for @entity6 till now has focused on laptops and @entity61 , product lines that are in decline			1
while the watch is widely expected , the start date of its mass production and the extent of @entity2 's involvement were not known until now			1
mass production will start in july and the commercial launch will come as early as october , according to the source and another person familiar with the matter			1
@entity6 will introduce a smartwatch with a display that likely measures 2.5 inches diagonally and is slightly rectangular , one of the sources said			0
the source added that the watch face will protrude slightly from the band , creating an arched shape , and will feature a touch interface and wireless charging capabilities			1
the source said @entity6 expects to ship 50 million units within the first year of the product 's release , although these types of initial estimates can be subject to change			1
the watch is currently in trial production at @entity2 , which will be the main manufacturer , accounting for at least 70 percent of final assembly , the source said			1
like many other smartwatches , @entity6 's watch will be able to perform some functions independently , but tasks like messaging and voice chat will require a paired smartphone , according to the source			1
the device will only be compatible with gadgets running @entity6 's @entity107 , like its flagship @entity38 , one of the sources said			1
a third source said @entity112 is the exclusive supplier of the screen for the gadget 's initial batch of production			1
it also contains a sensor that monitors the user 's pulse			1
@entity124 - based imaging and sensor maker @entity122 is on the supplier list for the feature , two other sources said			0
but the market is growing fast , with data firm @entity128 saying that worldwide shipments of wearable computing devices - a category that includes smartwatches - will triple in size this year over 2013			0
@entity6 has already dropped hints of its plans in this arena , hiring the former chief executive of @entity139 fashion house @entity138 , a unit of @entity140 , and proclaiming that it will introduce ' new product categories " ' this year			0
many are hoping that @entity6 's entry into the field of so - called smart wearables will be a game - changer that transforms the industry like the company 's @entity38 did in 2007			2
some are foreseeing that smartphone sales , the current cash cow of the consumer tech world , will lose momentum in the years ahead as the market reaches saturation			0
@entity128 predicts that worldwide smartphone sales will increase 23 percent this year , a slowdown from the 39 percent growth of last year , and that growth will average only 12 percent annually from 2013 to 2018			0
@entity6 vp @entity160 ’s recently hinted at the launch , saying : ' later this year , we ’ve got the best product pipeline that i ’ve seen in my 25 years at @entity6			0
' according top nikkei , the watch will run a version of @entity6 's @entity107 software currently found on the @entity169 and @entity38			1
' the new watch - like wearable gear will run on this os , which will be equipped with a centralized function to manage users ' biometric information via smartphones , ' it said			2
during a trip to @entity3 , a @entity177 tech analyst recently said an @entity6 supplier revealed a number of features of the much - rumoured device , including a rounded face and slim design			1
this would resemble how the @entity186 looks - and contradicts previous reports the watch would have a curved , or square screen			2
@entity177 analyst @entity190 claims an @entity6 supplier has revealed the @entity23 will have a rounded face , similar to the @entity186 , pictured , come in male and female versions , and will go into production in july			1
previous reports suggested it would have a curved , or square screen like the @entity196 and @entity199 's @entity198 range the reports were made by @entity190 from @entity201			1
according to his supply chain sources , the @entity23 will be designed to look like a traditional watch , and move away from the chunky , square look of the @entity196 and @entity199 ’s gear range			2
@entity207 announced its own plans for a round , @entity210 - powered smartwatch earlier this year and @entity190 's sources claim @entity6 ’s version will be almost identical , if not a little thinner			1
as @entity215 noted , @entity6 ’s icons have rounded edges and this would suit a circular face			2
@entity190 ’s source also confirmed previous rumours that the @entity23 would be available in ‘ his ’ and ‘ hers ’ models , and will go into production from july			2
the design is similar to concepts created by @entity226 from @entity227			0
@entity226 ’s concept incorporates the rumoured @entity230 fitness features that leaked in march , but experts believe @entity6 could additionally be working on a separate wristband specifically designed to track health			2
by comparison , the @entity234 , pictured , has a square , 2 - inch display and runs @entity234 - a streamlined version of @entity18 's current operating system seen on phones and tablet			2
the @entity199 range of @entity198 devices similarly chose a square , rather than rounded design the @entity186 , pictured , is expected to launch at @entity18 's @entity245 in june , followed by the @entity23 in september earlier this week , during the unveiling of its latest g3 handset , @entity112 gave a sneak peek of its square @entity210 - powered @entity196			1
all three - the @entity186 , the @entity196 and the @entity23 - are expected to launch later this year			2
it ’s likely the @entity186 will be announced at @entity18 ’s @entity245 in june , and go on sale for £ 180 in july , followed by the @entity23 during @entity6 ’s annual september event			2
price-wise , an @entity6 @entity23 may follow the same pattern as @entity6 ’s handsets and sit at the top end of the market			0
reports last month even stated it could cost ‘ thousands ’ of dollars			0
although the smartwatches of @entity199 and @entity259 have n’t been as popular as analysts predicted , @entity190 said orders for the @entity23 are surpassing expectation and he forecasts 18 to 21 million @entity263 will be sold before @entity264			0
@entity199 also recently revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market			0
the new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the @entity23 would have a curved screen , as seen in this concept by @entity275 @entity278 , part of luxury goods group @entity280 , said on friday its vice president for sales , @entity276 , who had been with the brand for seven years , was leaving on monday to join @entity6 - and is expected to work on the @entity23			2
there is widespread speculation @entity6 has been working on wearable devices , and its products tend to use proprietary technologies			0
however , an open system would be a departure for @entity199 as well			0
its gear wristwatches and fitness devices currently work only with @entity199 phones			0
smartwatches from @entity259 and other manufacturers tend to work with a wider range of @entity210 phones			0
last night , @entity199 revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market			0
@entity301 , vice president of @entity302 for @entity199 is pictured displaying the @entity303			0

will be made by @entity3 's @entity2
