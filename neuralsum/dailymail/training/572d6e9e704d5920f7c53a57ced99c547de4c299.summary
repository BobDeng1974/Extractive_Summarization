by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 09:44 est , 27 january 2014 most people would love to take a tour of a coral reef or speed past fish on holiday , but snorkelling can be slow and difficult to master			1
now a @entity9 sailing fanatic has found a new way to travel underwater with the agility and grace of a dolphin			1
@entity15 has created a clever device with two wings that is towed along by a boat to enable a person to be pulled along underwater while twisting , turning and performing acrobatics			1
a @entity9 sailing fanatic has found a new way to travel underwater with the agility and grace of a dolphin the @entity27 consists of two separate wings connected in a rotatable swivel			1
by grabbing the grip on each wing , it can easily be controlled in all directions			0
users can tilt both wings downwards to dive , and upwards to resurface			0
if attempting a roll , a person twists the wings in opposite directions			0
the company says that controlling the @entity27 is easy to learn and comes naturally to many first - timers			0
for more experienced @entity45 users , a single hand grip is mounted between the wings at the rear			0
this grip is designed to be used when equalising ear pressure and when one hand is needed			0
the device must be towed behind a boat			2
water is about 800 times denser than air and therefore high speeds are not necessary to achieve what feels like a fast speed under water			0
the company recommends a towing speed around 2 - 4 knots , ( 2.3mph to 4.6mph ) which can be achieved by a boat with a small motor			0
the 20 - year - old came up with the idea for @entity27 in 2010 during a sailing trip to the @entity67			1
the device is attached to a boat by @entity70 - the world 's strongest rope – and features two wings which can be rotated individually to control movement			2
by twisting them in certain ways , users can perform acrobatics , including spinning			0
by holding onto these wings the user is pulled along at anything from two to four knots , ( 2.3mph to 4.6mph with a scuba mask being the only other piece of gear required to create a sense of underwater flying			2
a deep breath is needed but @entity27 users can surface for breath when they like and manoeuvre the device by pointing its wings in the direction in which they wish to travel			1
because of the way the ropes are attached to the wings , a force balance between the user and the tow ropes is created , which reduces the energy required to operate the device and allows divers to hold their breath for longer , the company said			0
the @entity27 ( pictured ) has two wings and is connected by a flexible component that allows the device to be twisted so that users can steer and perform tricks the device costs $ 490 for the basic model , with the ultimate ' carbon glossy ' version priced at $ 895 beginners will typically spend between 10 and 15 seconds underwater at a time , diving to around three metres - but with more training and practice users can go much deeper and for longer			1
the carbon wings ' hollow design and foam filling allows the @entity27 to float when it is not being towed some 10 to 12 metres behind a speed boat			1

there are a number of accessories that can be attached to the wing , including a lighting system for dark waters and a @entity136 camera mount to let divers capture their experience on film			2

‘ when sailing through the @entity156 islands , i was astounded by the clarity of the water , it almost felt like flying when diving , just missing the speed and thrill , ’ he write on the company ’s website			0
‘ the first ideas of an underwater wing , towed behind a boat , started emerging deep in the right hemisphere of my brain			2
a deep breath is needed but @entity27 users can surface for breath when they like and manoeuvre the device by pointing its wings in the direction in which they wish to travel he first tested his idea with a piece of driftwood and a water ski rope			1
‘ the idea worked and i was able to control the up / downward moment without too much effort			0
but it was far from perfect and felt somewhat static , like a 2d videogame , it was missing a third dimension , ’ he said			0
the idea evolved into a design with two separate wings connected with a twistable joint and after a number of @entity194 prototypes made from items from a hardware shop in @entity197 , he knew the idea could be turned into a product and put the sailing trip on hold to create the product			2

@entity27 has two wings that can be twisted to perform tricks and is towed behind a speed boat to let people take a speedy underwater tour
device costs from *£* *296* ( $ 490 ) and users can select lighting and video camera accessories
@entity9 sailing fanatic came up with the idea while holidaying in the @entity67 and built a prototype with a piece of driftwood
