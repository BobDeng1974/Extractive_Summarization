a former @entity1 spy is being investigated by police on suspicion of defrauding a woman involved in one of the most costly and toxic divorce cases in @entity7 legal history			0

mr @entity14 , a former property and telecoms tycoon , enjoyed a lavish lifestyle with his former wife but said he lost his entire fortune in a disastrous property deal that left him £ 28million in debt			1
at the conclusion of @entity24 's marathon divorce case , she was awarded £ 20m @entity8 fought her ex-husband @entity9 , for eight years through 65 separate court hearings , at a cost to her of £ 6.5million , to try and secure a share of his fortune which she claimed exceeded £ 770million the couple once socialised in a super-wealthy league that included sir @entity29 , @entity30 and the late @entity32 oligarch @entity31			1

it was also said that they went on three to four foreign holidays a year , staying in villas and presidential suites			0
the couple enjoyed a luxury lifestyle - pictured here on a runway in @entity54 after their flight on @entity57 the couple were married in 1995 but it resulted in one of the most toxic and bitter divorces battles but the tycoon 's empire went into meltdown and he was declared bankrupt in 2010 and last year , after repeatedly refusing to produce financial documents , was jailed for six months for contempt of court			1
ms @entity8 maintains that he has squirrelled his assets offshore			2
in the end , the judge , mr @entity70 , agreed with her that ' he is not a penniless man of straw '			0
he decreed that @entity9 had a net fortune of £ 40 million and should therefore give ms @entity8 £ 20million			1
however one year on , she has yet to receive a penny and continues to fight for it			0
as such , she was forced to draw on the help of outside agencies to enforce her judgement order			0
ms @entity8 has yet to receive any of the money she was awarded and so paid £ 14,000 for information on her ex husband from @entity82 , who worked for 25 years for @entity83 and the @entity1 @entity14 , a property and telecoms tycoon , pictured with his model and tv presenter girlfriend @entity86 she was contacted in july by @entity87 , who worked for 25 years for @entity83 and the @entity1 before setting up his own private detective agency , @entity88			1
his @entity90 page describes him as a ' highly respected operative who formerly worked in the @entity92 ' and he specialises in cyber investigations , firearms training and ' suspect interrogation			0
' according to the @entity96 , mr @entity87 told ms @entity8 that he had come across some of her former husband 's hidden wealth in a @entity101 bank account while working on an assignment in @entity32			2
he therefore persuaded ms @entity8 to pay him £ 14,000 for the information , which she managed to raise through one of her previous litigation funders			1
ms @entity8 - who says she can not work because running her legal case is a full - time job - is currently surviving on benefits to support her two daughters , @entity110 and @entity111			0
at one point ms @entity8 begged mr @entity87 to hand over the information he claimed to have regarding her ex husband 's hidden wealth in a @entity101 bank account , saying ' i feel like crying , i 'm under so much pressure ' mr @entity87 , who attended @entity118 and @entity119 , said he would travel to @entity32 himself to recover the documentary evidence			1
however , suspicions were raised when another employee of @entity123 emailed ms @entity8 to say mr @entity87 had been captured by the @entity32 authorities who were going to hold him until another £ 15,000 was raised			2
ms @entity8 refused and mr @entity87 eventually emailed to say he had been released			2
by the end of july , mr @entity87 claimed he had returned to the @entity7 with ' two lever - arch files ' of material that supposedly detailed mr @entity14 's offshore wealth			2
however he repeatedly cancelled meetings with her and her @entity131 where he was supposed to hand it over			0
at one point , ms @entity8 emailed , begging him to hand it over , saying : ' i feel like crying , i 'm under so much pressure			0
' however , the information never materialised and eventually ms @entity8 reported mr @entity87 to the police			1
a senior @entity139 source confirmed an investigation into alleged fraud was under way , but refused to comment , citing operational reasons			0
the divorce battle between @entity8 and @entity14 was one of the most high profile in @entity7 legal history			0
