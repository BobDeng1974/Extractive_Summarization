taxpayers will have to find another £ 12billion by the end of the decade to pay for benefits for pensioners , a leading think tank has warned			1
workers face the prospect of paying more to sustain perks like the winter fuel allowance , more generous pensions and tax breaks on retirement pots			1
@entity13 , head of the @entity14 , warned the rising bill of an ageing population comes at a time when ' pensioners as a group have stopped being poor '			1
the @entity14 also warns that spending on public sector pensions is set to top £ 36billio this year , life expectancy has risen much faster than the state pension age and tax breaks costing billions have ' benefitted pensioners at the expense of workers '			1
in six years ' time there will be two million more people aged over 65 than there were in 2010			0
to deal with the increasing costs mr @entity13 said society has three choices - cutting benefits and services for older people , increasing taxes , or making cuts elsewhere			0
mr @entity13 said the choice made by the current government is ' pretty clear ' in focusing cuts on people of working age			0
writing in @entity55 , he said : ' cutting benefits for those over the state pension age is obviously difficult			0
people retire with a set of expectations about what the state will provide and may find it hard to adjust if that support is reduced			0
more prosaically , pensioners vote			1
' but in thinking about the shape of support for the older population it is important to be aware of one rather important fact			1
@entity13 , head of the @entity14 , claimed pensioners as a group ' have stopped being poor ' ' pensioners as a group have stopped being poor			1
or rather we have moved from a world only 30 years ago in which pensioners were much more likely to be poor than their younger counterparts to one in which they are less likely to be poor			2
' while he hailed that fact as ' probably the greatest triumph of social policy during my lifetime ' , mr @entity13 warned of the costs associated with it			0
he cited generous public sector pensions and also said ' plans to raise it ( the state pension age ) by a couple of years by the mid- 2020s do n't look so radical ' when the 10 - year rise in male life expectancy is considered			1
' despite increases in the state pension age for women , we are likely to be spending about £ 12billion more on benefits for pensioners in 2018 - 19 than in 2010 - 11 , ' he warned			2
research published yesterday by the @entity104 found pensioner poverty has fallen over the past decade , but showed there has been a big increase in the number of younger people living in poverty			2
pensioner poverty is now at the lowest level on record and the @entity21 's employment rate is close to a historic high , but incomes are lower than 10 years ago , and average wages for full - time male workers have fallen by £ 1 an hour to £ 12.90			2
the large - scale study carried out for the @entity104 found the fall of working families into poverty does not date from the beginning of the recession in 2008			0
instead , it reported that the remorseless rise of poverty among people who work for a living began in 2004			0
although the report does not attribute this to migration , the figure began to rise in the same year @entity132 ’s government opened the gates to allow migrants from @entity137 countries the right to work freely in @entity21			0
since then the eastern @entity137 population has shot up to around a million people , while high numbers of immigrants have continued to arrive from outside @entity142			0
many of the new arrivals have been competing with lower - skilled workers in the existing population for low - paid jobs .			1

rising cost of winter fuel allowance , generous pensions and tax breaks
@entity14 says pensioners are better off then workers
ageing population means cost the the taxpayer will soar over this decade
