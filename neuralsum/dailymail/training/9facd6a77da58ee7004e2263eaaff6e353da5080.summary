by @entity0 published : 05:54 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 12:02 est , 19 july 2012 @entity2 , just five days before she died from pneumonia and septicaemia a two - year - old girl died just 22 hours after doctors sent her home from hospital with ibuprofen , an inquest heard			1
@entity2 began displaying flu - like symptoms one week after her mother @entity12 , 27 , fell ill swine flu			1
her concerned father @entity14 , 30 , took her to @entity15 but doctors sent her home with the painkiller and advised her parents to give her plenty of water			0
@entity2 suddenly stopped breathing the following day and she was rushed back to hospital by ambulance but pronounced dead on arrival			1
traces of the deadly swine flu virus were found in her nose and throat but a pathologist ruled that she died of pneumonia and septicaemia			0
the inquest at @entity31 , near @entity32 , heard how doctors examined the toddler but sent her home after diagnosing a viral infection on november 17 , 2009			0
but the next night she started having difficulty breathing			0
when her parents dialled 999 , they were told the problems did not sound life - threatening , and an ambulance would arrive in up to 20 minutes			2
but moments later @entity2 stopped breathing and they called 999 again - and the ambulance arrived minutes later			1
@entity2 was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival			1
@entity48 coroner @entity47 heard a post-mortem examination found the medical cause of death was pneumonia and septicaemia			0
traces of swine flu , otherwise known as the @entity55 , were found in @entity2 ’s nose and throat			1
an investigation was launched straight after the toddler ’s unexpected death , with the hospital trust carrying out a child death review			2
dr @entity63 , who practices at @entity15 and specialises in paediatrics , chaired the review			0
he told the coroner that it was possible the pneumonia was already established in @entity2 ’s body when she was first examined at the hospital			1
however , he said she had had a ' very reassuring respiratory examination that pointed away from pneumonia ' before she was sent home			2
grieving : @entity74 with her son @entity75			0
daughter @entity2 died in 2009 dr @entity63 also said it was ' very unlikely ' septicaemia was established in her body when doctors saw her			1
dr @entity81 , the doctor who first examined @entity2 at the children ’s hospital , also gave evidence at the inquest			1
ms @entity47 heard that the toddler ’s respiratory rate and pulse rate had been high when she was admitted - which could have been a sign of pneumonia			1
but while she was waiting and was given water for her dehydration the rates lowered back to normal			0
dr @entity81 said when he examined the toddler her rates were normal and her parents were more concerned about her diarrhoea and vomiting - not common signs of pneumonia			2
he was asked by the coroner whether he should have re-taken the toddler ’s respiratory rate and pulse rates before she had been discharged			1
dr @entity81 replied that the toddler was correctly managed but re-taking these observations was something that had been implemented at the hospital following the review			1
her parents rang for an ambulance when she developed breathing problems a day after being sent home from hospital @entity111 , of @entity112 , explained why an ambulance had not been dispatched urgently after @entity114 and mrs @entity2 ’s initial call			1
he said that this was due to the way operators had been told to handle calls during the swine flu pandemic			0
because @entity2 was not displaying certain ' priority symptoms ' her case was not classed as an emergency			1
however , he explained that when her parents made a second call , an ambulance was on the scene in four minutes			0
@entity127 was treated at the @entity128 for children mr @entity111 said since @entity2 ’s death , and independently of it , the handling of such calls had been reviewed and she would now have been classed as a priority due to her age			1
recording a verdict of natural causes , ms @entity47 said : ' @entity2 attended hospital on november 17 , 2009 , presenting as an unwell two - year - old			1
' the medical review at the time did not identify her as having a serious illness and so she was discharged			2
' on november 18 she died from natural causes			0
' mr and mrs @entity2			2
originally from @entity146 , were unavailable for comment after the inquest			0
but speaking after their daughter ’s death in 2009 , the couple said if @entity2 had n’t been sent home she would ' still be alive '			2
@entity12 , who also has son @entity75 , four said : ' even when my husband explained i had swine flu they did n’t take it seriously			0
' she died within 24 hours of them sending her home from hospital and if they had n’t done that she would still be alive			2
she was a very beautiful , very active girl			0
' i do n’t know why they did n’t take it seriously			0
maybe it ’s because we are from another country , because we are foreigners			0

@entity2 *'s* respiratory rate and pulse rate was not taken again before she had been discharged - a *procedure* now implemented by the hospital
