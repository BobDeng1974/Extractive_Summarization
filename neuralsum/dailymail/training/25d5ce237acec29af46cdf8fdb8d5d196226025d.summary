by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 02:20 est , 19 september 2013 tonight 's @entity2 jackpot in the @entity3 is estimated at $ 400 million , making it the nation 's fifth - largest ever , though its jackpot hit $ 590 million earlier this year			1
the game 's rules were changed in early 2012 to boost payoffs and now organizers of the country 's other big lottery , @entity12 , are planning changes of their own			1
although @entity12 still holds the record for the largest jackpot in @entity3 history - a $ 656 million prize in march 2012 - organizers are hoping to more regularly see huge jackpots by lessening the odds of winning big while upping a player 's shot at smaller but still hefty prizes			1
@entity25 buys a @entity2 ticket on tuesday in @entity27 , @entity28 , to be in to win the $ 400m jackpot @entity12 does n't plan to change its $ 1 ticket price , but an extra $ 1 option already in the game will be expanded to allow players to increase their secondary prize total to between $ 1 million and $ 5 million , a major increase from $ 250,000			1
game changes also include boosting the starting jackpot from $ 12 million to $ 15 million , and allowing the jackpot to grow by at least $ 5 million between drawings when no top winner is selected			1
it 's those jackpots , not the name on the game , that ultimately draw in 45 - year - old @entity45			1
' depends on what 's up the highest , ' the electrician said tuesday while at a quicktrip convenience store in suburban @entity49			1
' i guess everyone wants to win the big one			1
' but fellow lottery player @entity25 , a school bus driver in @entity28 , said the changes did n't really matter			1
the 62 - year - old said he purchases tickets for both games several times a week and would be happy with any jackpot			1
' that 's nice , but i do n't care			1
i can get by with $ 10 million			1
i can get by with $ 3 million , ' he said after buying @entity2 tickets at a grocery store in @entity27			1
@entity62 shows his @entity2 ticket , in @entity27 , @entity28 , ahead of the jackpot ' i just play along with the @entity12 and @entity2			1
what it starts off with would be pretty comfortable for me to win			1
' the changes take effect for the oct. 22 drawing and were based on extensive consumer research , said @entity71 , executive director for the @entity72 and lead director for @entity12			1
she said officials decided not to increase ticket prices , but acknowledged @entity2 's success after it increased its ticket prizes from $ 1 to $ 2			1
' certainly we were looking at the fact that changes that @entity2 made , primarily by increasing the price point , it definitely favorably impacted the jackpot , ' @entity78 said			1
' it 's doing what it 's supposed to do , which is helping @entity2 have bigger jackpots on a pretty consistent basis			1
' the @entity2 jackpot is now the fifth biggest in @entity3 history1			2
$ 656 million , @entity12 , march 30 , 2012 ( 3 tickets from @entity49 , @entity93 and @entity94 ) 2			1
$ 590.5 million , @entity2 , may 18 , 2013 ( 1 ticket from @entity96 ) 3			2
$ 587.5 million , @entity2 , nov. 28 , 2012 ( 2 tickets from @entity98 and @entity99 ) 4			2
$ 400 million , @entity2 , ( drawing scheduled for wednesday , aug. 7 ; jackpot could grow ) 5			2
$ 390 million , @entity12 , march 6 , 2007 ( 2 tickets from @entity102 and @entity103 ) 6			1
$ 380 million , @entity12 , jan. 4 , 2011 ( 2 tickets from @entity105 and @entity106 ) 7			1
$ 365 million , @entity2 , feb. 18 , 2006 ( 1 ticket from @entity108 ) 8			2
$ 363 million , @entity109 , may 9 , 2000 ( 2 tickets from @entity93 and @entity111 ) 9			2
$ 340 million , @entity2 , oct. 19 , 2005 ( 1 ticket from @entity113 ) 10			2
$ 338.3 million , @entity2 , march 23 , 2013 ( 1 ticket from @entity103 ) she noted that both games are now sold @entity117 , as part of a 2010 licensing agreement , in 43 states , plus the @entity106 and the @entity121			2
' it 's great to have both games available to players and to have drawings four nights a week			2
i think that the two games complement each other , ' @entity78 said			2
the @entity28 - based @entity130 is operated by 33 state lotteries that help oversee @entity2			2
@entity12 has no central office and is run by individual state lotteries that handle their own accounting matters			1
' i applaud them for looking at changes , ' said @entity138 ceo @entity137			2
' you need to revise , you need to refresh			2
any good , big company knows that you need to revitalize your product			0
' here are some things to keep in mind ahead of wednesday night 's @entity2 jackpot drawing			0
the odds remember , a person 's odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175 million			0
that 's how many combinations are possible with the game 's five white balls and one red ball			0
in this case , there have been 11 drawings since august 10 without a winner			0
big jackpots a major revamp in january 2012 increased the cost of a @entity2 ticket from $ 1 to $ 2			0
it also led to larger jackpots in smaller amounts of time			1
of the top 10 @entity2 jackpots of all time , nearly half have been recorded after the game change			0
consolation prize since the revamp , a secondary $ 1 million prize has made some losers happy anyway			0
more than 730 people have won $ 1 million , and more than 120 people have won $ 2 million through the @entity2 option			0
why wait for the hype ? there 's technically no need to wait for a larger jackpot			0
whether the jackpot is $ 40 million or $ 400 million , your odds of winning the top prize are the same			0
whether you buy 1 ticket or 10 tickets , your odds are pretty much the same			0
a higher jackpot just means there 's a higher chance there will be more than one winning ticket			0
someone is going to win the chance of a person 's combination being selected remains astronomically high , though the chance that some set of six numbers will be selected is 1			0
that means even though your chances of winning are slim , the chances that someone else will win are high			0
@entity206 , executive director of the @entity207 , said that 's what makes people think it could be them			0
when it 's probably not			0
@entity214 , you 're not going to win remember , you 're probably not going to win			0
@entity206 said it 's hard for people to grasp how small their chances actually are , since no one can really see 175 million of anything			0
@entity206 tries to break it down			0
take 175 million one - dollar bills and lay them out			0
pick one lucky dollar bill that will win you all $ 175 million			0
you can line up those dollar bills twice along the edges of the continental @entity3			0
or you can cover 380 football fields			0
imagine picking the one lucky dollar bill from those fields , and that 's your chance of winning the @entity2 jackpot on a single ticket .			0

@entity12 is also changing its rules to create less huge wins and more smaller , but still hefty prizes
