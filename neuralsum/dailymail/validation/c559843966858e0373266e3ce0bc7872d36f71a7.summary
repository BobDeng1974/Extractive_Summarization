federal agencies made $ 125 billion in improper payments last year , including tax credits to people who did n't qualify , @entity1 payments for treatments that might not be necessary and unemployment benefits for people who were actually working , said a government report released monday			1
the level of improper payments was a new high after several years of declines			0
in addition to fraud , the errors included overpayments and underpayments , as well payments made without proper documentation			0
the federal government 's entire budget deficit for 2014 was $ 483 billion , making more than 25 per cent of that spending shortfall a self - inflicted wound			1
and with the latest estimates of the total @entity27 population hovering at 318.9 million , the misapplied spending represents nearly $ 392 for every man , woman and child living in @entity27			1
@entity31 to read the report @entity33 : the federal government sent out $ 125 billion in payments last year that it should n't have while the errors were spread among 22 federal agencies , three programs stood out : @entity1 , @entity39 and the @entity40			1
together , the three programs accounted for more than $ 93 billion in improper payments , according to the report by the @entity43 , the investigative arm of @entity44			1
' this taxpayer money was not spent securing our borders , it was not spent on national defense , and it was not spent contributing to a safety net for those in need , ' @entity46 sen. @entity45 said during a @entity56 hearing on monday			1
' this is a problem that is going to get worse year after year if we do not get a handle on it now			0
' these federal government programs were responsible for the biggest chunk of the $ 125 billion wasted on improper payments in 2014 : @entity45 chairs the @entity64 , which held a hearing on reducing improper payments by improving death records maintained by the @entity68			1
@entity68 has no death record for 6.5 million people who would be at least 112 years old , according to a report by the agency 's inspector general			1
in reality , only a few could possibly be alive			0
as of last fall , there were only 42 people known to be that old in the entire world			0
only 13 of the people are still getting @entity68 benefits , the report said			1
but for others , their @entity68 numbers are still active , so a number could be used to report wages , open bank accounts , obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds			2
@entity68 maintains a database of people who have died called the @entity93 , or @entity94			0
it helps public agencies and private companies know when @entity68 numbers are no longer valid for use			0
' their absence from the @entity94 could result in erroneous payments made by federal benefit - paying agencies that rely on the @entity94 to verify recipient eligibility , ' said @entity106 , the @entity68 inspector general			0
' it could also hinder state and local government and private industry – banks , insurance companies , and others – from identifying identity theft and other types of fraud			2
' @entity68 also makes mistakes by adding the names of people who are alive to the death list			0
each year , the agency adds about 9,000 names to the death list of people who are still living , said @entity125 , a senior adviser to the @entity68 's deputy commissioner for budget , finance , quality and management			1
the agency adds 2.8 million names a year to the list so the error rate is less than 1 percent , @entity125 said			0
but the impact on a person 's life can be devastating			2
@entity138 , a communications specialist living in @entity139 , told the committee that @entity68 has twice listed her as dead , once in 2001 and again in 2008			2
she could n't get a job , a bank account or a credit card			0
she could n't rent an apartment			0
' without a social security number , you can do nothing in the @entity27 , ' @entity145 said			1
' i had to move into my car			0
' rivers said her name has been removed from the list , but she still has problems getting credit because some financial institutions think she is using the @entity68 number of someone who is dead			0
the federal government 's increase in improper payments comes after three years of steady declines			2
the level previously peaked at $ 121 billion in 2010 before dropping to $ 106 billion for the 2013 budget year			2
the @entity168 administration says reducing improper payments is a priority			0
' while progress has been made over the years , the time has come for a more aggressive strategy to reduce the levels of improper payments we currently are seeing , ' said @entity175 , the controller at president @entity168 's budget office			2
@entity175 outlined several proposals in @entity168 's proposed budget for next year			2
they include programs to reduce fraud and abuse in @entity1 and @entity39 , as well as budget increases at the @entity185 to combat tax fraud			1
@entity1 's payments to doctors and hospitals had the most improper payments , at $ 46 billion			1
the report said many were caused by insufficient documentation for home health claims and errors on medical necessity forms for hospital patients			1
the @entity40 provides payments to low - income families through the tax code			1
the program had nearly $ 18 billion in improper payments , for an error rate of more than 27 percent			0
the report cited problems verifying incomes before the payments were issued			0
@entity43 report on $ 125 billion in improper payments in 2014 by @entity208			1

*stunning* @entity43 report came out during a @entity56 hearing on monday
wasted money amounts to nearly $ 392 for every man , woman and child living in the @entity27
@entity1 , @entity39 and the @entity40 were biggest *culprits*
most of @entity222 's health insurance *enrollments* have been new @entity39 patients
