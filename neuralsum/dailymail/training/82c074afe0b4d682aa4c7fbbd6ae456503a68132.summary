doctors have warned that the new helpline has led to up to three times more ambulance call - outs and private sector operators have threatened to boycott the bidding process because of concerns about cost and the practicality of the plans			1
@entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 have withdrawn from the tender process , leaving @entity39 and publically - owned ambulance trusts as the only potential bidders			0
@entity36 cited a lack of organisation as its reason , saying the 111 line had not been ' constructed in a manner that will result in cost effective services '			2
@entity11 employs 3,000 staff , of which 40 per cent are trained nurses			2
but the 111 number will be staffed by call centre handlers with just six weeks ' training			1
the @entity17 claims this will lead to more referrals and will prove a particularly risky enterprise for vulnerable patients			2
dr @entity57 , chairman of the @entity17 's gp committee said : ' a potentially dangerous version of @entity60 is set to burst forth upon an unsuspecting public from april ' patients may end up being sent to the wrong place , waiting longer , blocking @entity64 and using ambulances needlessly , when a little more consideration might make it all work properly			1
' critics claim the 111 number leads to ambulances being sent out unnecessarily @entity69 , a gp from @entity71 who is part of a doctors ' co-operative @entity73 , said the pilot schemes showed that ambulance dispatch rates are now three times as high in these four areas			0
' that 's treble the costs , ' she told @entity81			0
' also , we see evidence of poorer care to children			0
' in february , the @entity17 wrote to the government saying the deadline for introducing the 111 number needs to be relaxed from its current date of april 2013			1
in a letter to health secretary @entity25 , the @entity17 said doctors had raised a ' number of serious problems and concerns ' in the pilot schemes used to test the new number			2
they included concerns over the level of medical training staff will have in the new service , and whether they will be able to direct patients to the right help			2
doctors said they have not had enough time to get involved in the project , and are concerned ' patients will actually receive lower quality care '			0
the 111 number is currently being piloted in @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity109 and the @entity110			0
in january , the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) warned that up to 300 frontline staff at @entity11 could lose their jobs under new shift arrangements as the new 111 number is phased in			1
workers who are unable to join the new shift pattern will lose their jobs , including those with flexible working arrangements already in place , such as those caring for children , it said			0
@entity11 denied the claims , saying 79 per cent of frontline staff had been offered ' one of their preferred roster patterns ' and there were enough spaces for everyone to be allocated to a new roster			0
@entity11 is not the only organisation tendering to deliver @entity60 111 services			0
the new system could allow private and @entity70 out - of - hours providers and the ambulance service , among others , to deliver the service .			0
