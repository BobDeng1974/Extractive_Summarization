by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:10 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 09:50 est , 21 june 2012 @entity2 was onvicted of the manslaughter of her three - year - old daughter after an inquest into the 2004 death was dramatically halted by a coroner a ' remorseless ' mother jailed for killing her three - year - old daughter had laughed and joked as the young girl lay dying in hospital , it emerged today			1
@entity2 , 33 , was yesterday convicted of the manslaughter of her young daughter @entity13 in 2004 , eight years after a coroner dramatically halted the youngster 's inquest			1
@entity2 , jailed for seven years yesterday , suffocated @entity13 just six months after her seven - month - old son @entity18 died in an apparent cot death , a court heard			1
but it emerged today that @entity2 laughed and joked with her youngest daughter just minutes after medics said they were losing the battle save @entity13			2
the mother also telephoned a vicar and her husband before calling for an ambulance for her stricken daughter , according to the @entity29 @entity2 's daughter @entity13 was found with cuts and bruises on her neck and shoulders at the family home in @entity36 , @entity37 , in february 2004			1
the three - year - old was rushed to @entity39 in @entity40 but could not be saved			1
after conflicting post mortem reports , @entity2 was arrested two days after @entity13 's death , but a lack of evidence saw prosecutors drop the case			1
she was rearrested when a coroner dramatically halted the youngster 's inquest and forced police to reopen the investigation			1
a judge told @entity2 she had gone from ' carer to killer ' when she inflicted fatal injuries on her young daughter in 2004			1
a jury at @entity58 convicted @entity2 of manslaughter but cleared her of murder			1
sentencing yesterday judge @entity61 said : ' the jury have convicted you of manslaughter of your three - year - old daughter @entity13			1
' it may well be you are the only one who knows exactly what happened on that dreadful day in 04 which took you from carer to killer			0
' since then you have done your level best to lie your way out of any responsibility			0
' this indicates you have little or no remorse for what you did			0
' an original post mortem found that @entity13 may have died from a sudden onset of a bacterial infection which led to her choking on her own vomit			1
@entity2 's house in @entity36 , @entity37 , where her daughter @entity13 was found not breathing with bruises however , during a second examination this was disputed and the idea put forward that suspicious bruising on the tot 's upper body may mean her airways had been compressed forcefully			1
at the time @entity2 claimed her daughter had been ' perfectly fine ' earlier in the day but that she had been tired so she had put her to bed - she later told paramedics she thought her daughter had had a ' fit '			1
after she had found her daughter @entity94 refused to ring the emergency services until she had spoken to her husband - whom she told ' it 's happened again ' in reference to @entity13 's younger brother @entity99 who had been found dead in his cot six months previously			2
describing how @entity2 later joked about her daughter in hospital , nurse @entity101 , who was in a waiting room with the mother , said : ' the girl put a paper cup of water to her mouth but it spilled down her front			1
' the mum said , " she 's always doing that "			0
she appeared to find it quite hilarious			0
' paramedics at @entity39 in @entity40 noticed two marks on her neck which had started to bruise and requested the attendance of police at the hospital			0
@entity2 was arrested in february 2004 and interviewed by police then and again in may			2
her case was passed to the @entity122 who decided there was not enough evidence to charge @entity2 with the murder of @entity13			1
' this was a difficult and complex case that involved evidence from a number of medical experts			0
' @entity132 , @entity122 but during her inquest in 2009 @entity37 coroner @entity133 demanded the case was revisited			1
the inquest threw up new information which had been given by medical experts in 2005 during a @entity140 into @entity13 's death			0
this information had not been passed on to the cps			0
@entity2 was then rearrested and charged in july 2011			0
prosecutor @entity143 said during the trial that the inquest had ' excluded the likelihood ' of a serious infection and found that injuries to the airways were consistent with an ' application of force '			2
on july 12 , 2011 , @entity2 was therefore rearrested and ms @entity152 said she told officers : ' i have been waiting for this to happen			0
' @entity2 , 33 , was arrested in february 2004 and interview by police then and again in may during his sentencing @entity159 told the court he took into account @entity2 's ' childlike manner ' and the ' long delay ' in bringing the trial to court			2
however he said courts have a duty to ' protect little people like @entity13 from violence '			0
speaking afterwards , detective chief inspector @entity171 , of the @entity172 and @entity173 , said : ' there was a thorough police investigation at the time but the forensic evidence then did not support a prosecution			0
' the death of @entity13 was immediately treated as suspicious by @entity180			0
her mother was arrested and interviewed and there was a thorough investigation			0
' however , based on the information available at the time , the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) decision was that there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution			2
' the @entity122 decision turned largely on reports from two pathologists , which were conflicting			0
' @entity132 , of the @entity122 , said : ' this was a difficult and complex case that involved evidence from a number of medical experts			1
' the reinvestigation into the circumstances of @entity201 's death included obtaining further medical evidence			2
' this evidence effectively ruled out a natural cause of death and was consistent with @entity13 having been suffocated			0
' the only person who could have done this was her mother , @entity2			2
' after the sentencing @entity208 declined to comment .			0

@entity122 had felt there was *n't* enough evidence to prosecute @entity2
in 2009 @entity37 coroner @entity133 demanded the case was revisited
@entity201 was found with bruises on neck and shoulder in 2004
jury convict her mother of inflicting fatal injuries on the three - year - old
three post mortems ruled youngster had died from *asphyxia* caused by the forced *blockage* of her airways
