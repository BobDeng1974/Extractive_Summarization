the information was obtained by @entity1 mp @entity1 - pictured at the party conference - after a two year freedom of information battle with the @entity4 the identities of dead teenagers as old as 17 were stolen by undercover police officers according to figures released by @entity9			1
the @entity4 revealed that dead children aged ' 0 , 1 , 4 to 14 , 16 and 17 ' had their identities stolen by the rogue @entity13 in a practice the force conceded was ' morally repugnant '			1
the information was obtained by @entity1 mp @entity1 after a two year @entity19 battle with the @entity4			1
the force only released the figures after a court date was set to hear the @entity4 's appeal against a ruling by the information commissioner to publish the figures , and after mr @entity1 had tabled a parliamentary question on the matter			2
the practice was widespread according to an investigation of the secretive squad by @entity33 chief constable @entity32 , who has also looked at claims that officers were involved in inappropriate sexual relationships while undercover			0
mr @entity32 found that out of 106 covert names used by the squad between 1968 and 2008 , 42 can be confirmed or be treated as highly likely to have come from dead children			1
mr @entity1 said families with children who died aged two , three and 15 during the time the practice was going on could now be reassured that their identities had not been stolen			2
the mp for @entity43 said : ' the reason i started pursuing this matter was a constituent who had lost his daughter when she was 15			0
' when he first heard about this practice he was galled at the thought that someone could be using her stolen identity , leading the life that she should have led , and he is not alone			0
' unfortunately this practice was sufficiently widespread but now a small proportion of families will be able to use this information to be reassured that their child 's identity was not stolen , which does raise the question whether there is any other way that the police could help reassure more families			2
' but it also proves our case that the information commissioner was rightly to make in court that there was a public interest in this information being released			0
' the data was published nearly two years after mr @entity1 originally submitted an @entity19 request to the @entity4 in feburary 2013			2
the force twice refused mr @entity1 ' request although it acknowledged the information was available			0
after the mp appealed to the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) in january 2014 , it ordered the @entity4 to disclose the information in august , saying this would not lead to the identification of undercover officers			2
the force then appealed against the decision to a tribunal , with the @entity80 and later mr @entity1 being confirmed as respondents to the appeal			0
undercover police stole identities of dead teenagers , according to @entity9 figures @entity9 only released the figures after a court date was set to hear the @entity4 's appeal against a ruling by the information commissioner to publish the figures on december 17 the hearing date was set for february this year and a day later mr @entity1 tabled a parliamentary question to home secretary @entity100 on the matter			1
four days after that , the @entity4 wrote to mr @entity1 informing him that it would withdraw its appeal and publish the information			0
in its final response to the mp , the @entity4 acknowledged that mr @entity1 had been on a ' difficult journey ' in getting the information but said it had reconsidered its challenge to the @entity80 and acknowledged the fact that stealing dead children 's identities may be viewed as ' morally repugnant '			1
@entity112 , the force 's senior information manager , wrote : ' before i get to the information itself the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) believes it pertinent to mention that it has been recognised by the @entity118 and the @entity119 in particular , that the tactic of using the identity of a deceased child to form a legend for undercover police officers may be viewed by some as ' morally repugnant ' and that it is no longer police practice			1
' the @entity4 has , in the intervening period , reconsidered its position in challenging the decision of the @entity80 at @entity129 and has decided that disclosure will indeed be made in this case			0
therefore , in accordance with the aforementioned decision notice , please find below the information held by the @entity119 relevant to your request : ' the ages of deceased children that were used by undercover officers are 0 , 1 , and 4 to 14 , 16 and 17			1
' the @entity4 fully understands and appreciates that it has been a difficult journey in arriving at this position but does now hope that the information above is of interest			0

@entity9 said dead children aged between 0 and 17 had ids stolen
