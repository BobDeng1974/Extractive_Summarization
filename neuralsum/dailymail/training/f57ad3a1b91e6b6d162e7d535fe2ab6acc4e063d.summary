wrong diagnosis : professor sir @entity9 , the new head of the @entity11 says that there is a growing trend of medicating normal traits in children by the insistence of overbearing parents along with mental health diagnosis , one of the most commonly medicated disorders is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity35 )			1
if a child is seen as being overactive , but does not necessarily have @entity35 , he could be prescribed drugs , professor @entity9 said			1
he told @entity39 : ' certain behaviour carry stigma and there 's less stigma if it 's associated with a disorder			2
often it 's about the avoidance of guilt			0
' you get obvious pressures from parents : we 've all been to middle class dinner parties where so many parents seem to say their kids are mildly autistic and yet they 've just got into @entity54			2
and you think ' i do n't really buy that one ' ... around three to seven per cent of children , or 400,000 , are believed to have adhd in the @entity57 , with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school			2
according to recent figures , the use of @entity35 drugs has tripled over the past decade and antidepressants usage has shot up too			2
professor @entity9 said that it is becoming less common for children to be labelled as ' shy ' but they are more likely to be branded as having a social phobia or a behavioural problem			1

@entity21 ( @entity21 ) tablets : pushy parents are getting @entity19 to prescribe drugs such as @entity21 for young children paediatric neurologist dr @entity93 , based in @entity94 , believes that @entity35 simply ‘ does n’t exist ’ and is being used as a mask for less serious problems			1

‘ adhd makes a great excuse , ’ dr @entity93 said in his book , ‘ adhd does not exist : the truth about @entity100 and @entity35			0
’ ‘ the diagnosis can be an easy - to - reach - for crutch			0
moreover , there ’s an attractive element to an adhd diagnosis , especially in adults - it can be exciting to think of oneself as involved in many things at once , rather than stuck in a boring rut			0
’ echoing dr @entity93 's views , a group of researchers from @entity115 and the @entity116 said in november that the diagnosis of @entity35 may have become too broad			0
a wider classification of symptoms for @entity35 in the psychiatric ‘ bible ’ used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and prescriptions for medication , the study warned			0
