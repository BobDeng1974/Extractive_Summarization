at a time when @entity2 ca n’t get away from ridicule , there ’s a familiar face who just wants to show them some love			1
maybe the man with the backwards cap and cut - off denim shorts is being polite as he mentions a possibility that currently seems inconceivable			2
‘ i love @entity12 , ’ he says			2
‘ everyone knows that — i have said it many times			2
@entity12 is in my heart			0
i left many good friends there , the supporters are amazing and i wish i can come back one day			2
‘ i am happy here in @entity32 and have four more years , but in the future you never know because they treated me unbelievably there			1
’ the cameras and microphones go off			0
the mass of handlers that accompany the world ’s best footballer on these rare ‘ media opportunities ’ start their sweep of the room at the culmination of a long day			1
he has kicked balls at a £ 200,000 supercar driven by @entity22 , fired one accurately at a friend ’s groin and also grimaced in response to a dignitary ’s praise for @entity66			1
but now it ’s time to leave the arid surrounds of the @entity70 race circuit outside @entity32			1
it ’s scorching , inside and out			0
but @entity20 has one more thing he wants to say to @entity73			1
‘ i really did love being at @entity2 , ’ he says			1
‘ believe me , they will be a good team again , i ’m sure of it			0
it is a great club			0
’ over the previous 20 minutes , having already talked about his tears , trophies and dream to see his four - year - old son go into professional football , he has had his say on the remarkable summer of spending at @entity86			1
sealed with a kiss : @entity20 beat @entity88 and @entity89 to be named @entity91 's @entity90 in @entity91 ripped ! the @entity92 celebrates after scoring in the @entity94 final to help land ' la decima ' home sickness ? @entity32 forward admits he would love to return to @entity86 one day good friends : ( @entity100 ) @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity20 celebrate winning the 2009 - 09 @entity103 @entity104 hopes for @entity2 return it ’s the club sir @entity107 — the only manager @entity20 ‘ would call a friend ’ — once said would not spend fortunes on established talent ; a club that once nurtured @entity20 and has since spent £ 150million in a single summer spree on the proven capabilities of @entity115 and @entity116 , among others			1
@entity20 ’s own irritation at @entity115 ’s departure from @entity32 will soon be made clear , but their loss , in his eyes , is @entity2 ’s gain			1
as is the counter-intuitive addition of @entity116 to an already attack - heavy squad , whose fall from grace has been watched closely by arguably their greatest player			1
@entity20 is known to follow them diligently on television and online			1
‘ this can happen , ’ he says			0
‘ bad moments and good moments			0
@entity12 is passing through a bad moment			0
last year it was a horrible season and this year they have n’t started well , either			2
‘ but i do think they did well to buy @entity115 and @entity116			1
i think the team will be much better			0
i want to see them better because it is such a fantastic club and they deserve to be better			0
‘ @entity116 is a very good signing			1
he is a very good player			0
’ father figure : @entity20 claims sir @entity107 is the only manager has has ever considered a ' friend ' careless whisper : it 's fair to say that @entity20 and @entity66 did n't always see eye to eye and yet conventional logic suggests @entity2 need to add more cement to the mix , with a defence and structure less convincing than at any time in recent memory			1
priority , or so the common wisdom goes , should have been given to a different part of the pitch			0
but @entity20 says : ‘ i do n’t think @entity116 is the wrong type of player for them			1
‘ he is a top player , so i do n’t think it is a wrong buy			0
he will be a fantastic buy			0
@entity12 have not started well , two points in three games , so they need quality players and @entity116 is a quality player			1
’ @entity115 is also something of a sore point , as was the loss of @entity171 to @entity172			1
for a second summer in succession , having offloaded @entity175 to @entity176 last year , @entity20 objected to @entity32 ’s sale of what he considers key personnel			1
‘ i have strong opinions , but i ca n’t always say what i think , ’ he later told @entity181 reporters			0
‘ if it was up to me , i would n’t have done so			0
but if the president thinks the best thing for the team is to sign players and let others leave , we must respect and support the decision			0
‘ with new players , the style will change and it may change for better or worse			0
’ class is permanent : the 29 - year - old insists that @entity2 will return to former glories cream of the crop : @entity115 and @entity116 are world class signings for @entity2 , insists @entity20 red devil : @entity20 won three @entity103 titles and the @entity94 with @entity2 for @entity20 , at 29 years old and having scored a scarcely believable 255 goals in 250 @entity32 games , ‘ better ’ is the only option			1
having just enjoyed arguably his finest season , in which he was awarded the @entity207 and won the @entity94 for a second time , last month he was named @entity91 ’s best player			1
when he ’s asked to sum it up , his smirk says almost as much as his words			0
‘ when you are nominated for the best player in @entity91 , the @entity207 , playing in the @entity94 , there is so much pressure , ’ he says			1
‘ you do n’t know what will happen			0
this pressure is inside you — you always have it			0
‘ but really , the last year was just fantastic			2
now the best player in @entity91 as well , that was fantastic for me			0
i had an opportunity to say thank you to my team - mates because without them individual awards are not possible			2
‘ my ambition now is to do the same stuff as last year , win the most important trophies , collectively and individually			2
i always want to do better than the year before			2
’ trouble at home ? @entity20 has criticised @entity32 for selling the likes of @entity115 , @entity175 and @entity171 enter the dragon : @entity20 has not been surprised by @entity231 's ( @entity232 ) success in @entity233 new arrivals : @entity20 welcomes £ 60m summer signing @entity235 to the @entity236 take stat : the @entity92 has scored an incredible 255 goals in 250 games for @entity32 as he says this , his young son , @entity240 , is darting around the room			1
an hour earlier , the four - year - old had squirmed free from ‘ @entity245 ’ and dived into @entity26 ’s @entity246 , an £ 800,000 machine that @entity20 had been driving as part of a @entity27 challenge between him and @entity22 , another ambassador for the watch brand			1
the company ’s ceo , @entity251 , had been making small talk with @entity20 and mentioned his admiration for @entity66			1
@entity20 ’s facial expression suggested a lower opinion			2
@entity240 , meanwhile , was smiling for cameras in the car			2
‘ you ’re in trouble in 15 years , ’ @entity22 said to @entity20			1
‘ he loves cars now , ’ @entity20 said back			1
‘ it is my dream ( for him to play professionally ) , ’ @entity20 says			2
‘ of course i want @entity20 to be a football player			2
‘ but these things we can not control			0
’ golden balls : @entity20 celebrates winning the 2014 @entity207 award for the world 's best player nemesis : the @entity32 superstar shares a competitive relationship with @entity275 ( @entity232 ) it was the presence of the son that led the father to cry when presented with the @entity207 , the token of recognition that he has , maybe briefly , outperformed @entity275			1
‘ it was an emotional moment for me , ’ @entity20 says			2
‘ i was honest with myself , i was feeling very emotional and i started to cry			0
‘ after @entity20 came into my arms , it was probably one of the best moments in my life so far			2
’ quite what happens next remains to be seen			0
he talks of dedicating himself completely to football			0
he says : ‘ if you are not serious you will never be a top professional player — i have thought that since i was 12			2
that is the advice i give to young boys			0
’ and he adds that @entity231 ’s success in @entity181 is no surprise			1
‘ he is just a fantastic player and will help @entity32 win more trophies , ’ @entity20 says			1
‘ he is feeling more comfortable			0
it is a different league and a different culture , a different language			0
‘ he is more comfortable on the pitch			0
’ mini me : @entity20 would like his son @entity240 ( r ) to become a professional football player fingers crossed : @entity2 and @entity103 fans would love to see @entity20 return to the club so is @entity20			1
perhaps one of the greatest in history			0
united supporters should keep their fingers crossed that he walks like he talks			0

he won three @entity103 titles and @entity94 with @entity2
@entity92 says that @entity107 is only manager he would call a friend
