of all the rumours that dogged princess @entity3 ’s life , it was surely the one that hurt her the most : that @entity7 – not prince @entity8 – was the father of her second child			1
now that painful insinuation has been reignited after @entity7 gave his backing to a controversial new @entity12 play suggesting that he could indeed be prince @entity14 ’s father			1
the @entity15 can reveal the former cavalry officer has allowed himself to be portrayed in the production @entity18 , @entity3 , which contains explosive revelations about his relationship with the princess			2
@entity23 looks : @entity7 and @entity3 ( left ) watch @entity14 ( far right ) during a visit to an @entity26 base in 1989 the author of the play , which makes its debut at @entity31 ’s @entity30 on january 9 , says it is based on extensive interviews with figures who knew @entity3 ‘ in their own words ’ , including @entity7 and @entity38 , her former butler			1
in one sensational scene @entity7 tells a journalist : ‘ @entity3 and i started our relationship more than a year before @entity14 was born			1
now that does n’t prove that i am his father			0
it ’s just the ... inconvenient truth			0
’ @entity7 , 56 , last night confirmed that he knows author @entity47 and spoke to him about his relationship with @entity3 , and said he had no doubt the play would be ‘ accurate ’			1
he said he had not seen the play or read specific scenes even though @entity47 claimed he had sent him 15 pages of the script for his approval			1
@entity47 said : ‘ i have been talking to @entity7 over a period of two years			0
i met him and he told me some quite remarkable things that have never been said in the public domain , particularly about when his relationship with @entity3 started			1
‘ there is a startling revelation that @entity7 makes and he has allowed me to make it in the play			2
this is the fact that his relationship with @entity3 started 18 months before prince @entity14 was born			1
’ he added : ‘ we are not saying he is prince @entity14 ’s father although the audience may take their own view on that			1
@entity7 gave his backing to the @entity12 play - which suggests he could indeed be @entity14 ’s father ‘ i do n’t know if @entity7 is prince @entity14 ’s father and @entity7 has always denied it either because it is n’t true or out of some sense of loyalty			1
’ the play , about a journalist trying to find out the truth about @entity3 ’s death in 1997 , does not feature a depiction of the princess herself , but it does include claims about her life , including the unfounded suggestion she was pregnant with @entity88 ’s baby when she died			2
but it is the references to prince @entity14 ’s paternity which are likely to be the most shocking			2
in the play , the character of @entity7 insists that he has always denied being prince @entity14 ’s father , but the play still includes several references to the issue			1
when the journalist , who is played by @entity47 , asks @entity7 if he knows who prince @entity14 ’s father is , he pauses before answering : ‘ of course i do			1
’ the subject is touched upon again when @entity7 discusses his decision to pursue a military career like his father			2
he is asked if he would like his own son to follow family tradition before two pictures of him and @entity14 in near identical military uniform appear on screen			0
royal commentators last night branded the play as ‘ a nonsense ’			1
but @entity47 , previously a producer who wrote the successful 2010 musical @entity111 which starred @entity112 , said all the revelations in the play were either taken from official documents or were based on interviews with key figures from @entity3 ’s life			1
@entity47 said he had shown @entity7 the scenes in advance and that the former officer had approved them			0
rumours about prince @entity14 ’s paternity first began to circulate in 1994 when revelations about his mother ’s affair with @entity7 became public			1
for more than a decade @entity7 denied the claims and insisted that his affair with @entity3 did not start until 1986 when the @entity14 was already two years old			1
princess @entity3 pictured with @entity14			2
the rumour that @entity7 is prince @entity14 's father - and not @entity8 - dogged @entity3 's life but in 2005 the disgraced publicist @entity131 claimed in a biography that @entity7 had confided to him that the relationship predated prince @entity14 ’s birth			1
royal commentators last night rubbished the new claims and insisted there was no way @entity7 was the @entity14 ’s father			1
@entity140 , who has just published an acclaimed biography of @entity14 , said : ‘ i have spoken to people around at the time and they all say that @entity7 was n’t in the picture before 1986			2
@entity3 did n’t hide @entity7 when the relationship began			2
she kept him in plain sight			0
’ respected royal author @entity148 said the claims in the play were a ‘ nonsense ’ and that @entity7 was simply trying to raise his profile			1
she said : ‘ i think this will put him back in the spotlight and it tells producers of reality tv programmes , “ hello , i ’m here			0
” it ’s a nonsense but it ’s all a game			0
’ biographer @entity158 said the play ’s claims were not surprising given the people who had been interviewed by @entity47			0
he said : ‘ if you talk to certain people you will get a version of events these people are keen to peddle			0
they have an agenda of their own			0
’ the controversial play is to be staged at @entity30 in @entity31			2
it makes its debut on january 9 @entity7 last night confirmed he knew @entity47 but he declined to be drawn on the play ’s contents			2
he said : ‘ i do know @entity47			0
i am aware that he has done a play and i am sure that it is accurate			0
i obviously have not seen it yet			0
’ when pushed on the specific line in the play about the timing of his affair with @entity3 , he said : ‘ that is not my quote			2
’ he also insisted that he had not seen the script for the play			0
he said : ‘ i have not seen the script			0
neither have i seen the play			0
it would be foolish to comment on it before doing so			0
’ @entity7 last night refused to say when his relationship with @entity3 began and declined to be drawn on the issue of prince @entity14 ’s parentage			1
he said : ‘ i wish this subject would go away			0
it ’s never going to and that ’s just the way of life			0
’ a spokesman for @entity196 last night declined to comment .			0
