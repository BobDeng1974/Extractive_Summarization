parents have hit out at a high school 's ' ridiculous ' dress code after dozens of girls were turned away from their homecoming dance			1
some arrived at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , wearing floor - length gowns , others in high - necked ensembles			1
but one by one , around 24 girls were forced to sit in a line for inspection - before being ordered to leave			1
one of the girls who was turned away on saturday , @entity17 , arrived in a floor - length dress			1
she told @entity28 13 : ' they pulled me to the side and asked me to twirl around to see if i was immodest , then made me sit against the wall			0
' ' and while i was sitting against the wall there was about ten other girls that were sitting there being embarrassed			2
' eventually , a teacher told her ' it 's too low in the back ' and that she ' needed to get a jacket or go home and change clothes '			2
her classmate @entity44 was also sent home in her knee - length purple halter - neck dress			1
@entity44 had made sure her dress did not come up past mid-thigh when she sat down - one of the school 's strict rules			1
sweeping : despite the length , officials at @entity6 in @entity8 deemed @entity17 's dress ' inappropriate ' strict : she was told to go home and get a jacket or to leave the homecoming dance on saturday altogether but when she arrived , teachers would not let her in			1
' they just took a wild guess and said , ' you 're not admitted in			0
'' her father @entity61 told @entity28 13 : ' i asked them why they turned her away and then showed them a picture of her on the phone i 'd taken myself of her sitting down where the dress meets her knees			0
' the school has rebuffed criticism , claiming its guidelines are clearly stated on the website			0
the code , posted online , reads : ' dresses should cover chest and back at the top of the armpit and should be secure and stay in position			0
' hemlines should go no higher than the mid-thigh when seated			0
' boys should be in collared shirts and no jeans			0
vetted : @entity44 had checked her dress against the guidelines before arriving but was turned away too short ? the school rules dresses must not come up above mid-thigh when sitting down angry : @entity44 left the dance and refused to return because she was so embarrassed by the incident ' behaviour / dancing should be safe and appropriate			1
' students who fail to follow these guidelines will be not admitted or removed from the dance			2
' however , the students and their parents insist they were singled out for no reason while other students were allowed to go in			2
@entity101 , another student upset by the situation , told @entity103 : ' other girls were admitted into the dance wearing my same dress in different colors			1
i was in high heals ( sic ) , as you can see , and i am a taller girl			0
' i am very angry , especially because my date could n't get his money refunded			0
surely you can understand the injustice			0
i 'm nearly an adult , and my parents allowed me to go out in this dress			2
' the incident comes two years after nearby @entity119 barred dozens of girls from the homecoming dance for wearing dresses that were ' too short '			1
however , days later , the principal issued an apology .			0

around 24 girls sent home from @entity6 dance on saturday
students at school in @entity7 , @entity8 , calling on teachers to apologize
one wore a floor - length high - necked dress , another 's was knee - length
parents have sent pictures of dresses to teachers asking for *explanation*
