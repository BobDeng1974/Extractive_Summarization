disgraced mp @entity0 has resigned his membership of the @entity2 disgraced mp @entity0 has resigned his membership of the @entity2 , the party has confirmed			1
the move came after the veteran @entity6 mp , who had already been suspended by the party , was forced publicly to apologise to a vulnerable woman constituent for making improper sexual advances			1
in june mr @entity0 gave an ' unreserved ' apology at @entity12 's @entity11 over an ' inappropriate and unprofessional friendship ' with a single mother known as @entity15 , who had sought his assistance as her mp and local councillor			1
solicitors for the woman said the apology was part of a ' confidential settlement ' in which the ' vulnerable woman ' , who suffers from mental health problems , brought a claim for damages against him			1
a @entity2 spokesman said mr @entity0 had quit before an internal party disciplinary hearing			1
@entity2 leader and deputy prime minister @entity31 had previously called on mr @entity0 to resign his membership and said he had ' no future ' in the party			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' i can confirm he has resigned from the party			1
' we have received a letter confirming his resignation			0
obviously , there was due to be a disciplinary hearing imminently , so before that has happened he has resigned			1
' @entity45 , the @entity46 leader of @entity47 , called for mr @entity0 , who failed to hold his seat as a councillor in this year 's local elections , to also stand down from his seat in @entity52			1
she said : ' yet again this is another example of @entity0 jumping literally seconds before he is pushed			2
' @entity31 had suspended him from the @entity2 and removed the whip back in 2013 with an agreement there would be a review of his membership and before that happened , he has resigned from the party , so i am not surprised at all			1
' @entity0 has had a long career in @entity52 , in excess of 40 years , it 's very sad his parliamentary career has ended the way it has but it was only a matter of time that his past has caught up with him in the form of this alleged sexual assault by a woman he came in contact with through @entity47 and it is a very sad indictment of his parliamentary career and now it 's time for him to stand down			1
' the 68 - year - old had repeatedly denied the allegations by the single mother during her four - year fight to obtain an apology			2
but as part of a @entity11 settlement earlier this year he apologised unreservedly for any distress			2
in a statement read at the @entity11 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ in october 2009 you first came to me as a constituent to seek my assistance as your mp and councillor			1
the resignation came after the veteran @entity6 mp ( pictured ) was forced publicly to apologise to a vulnerable woman constituent for making improper sexual advances ' subsequently and over several months i came to your home on several occasions , sometimes unannounced and conducted a friendship that was inappropriate and unprofessional			1
‘ i understand that you felt degraded			0
i did not treat you with sufficient respect			0
i made you feel deeply uncomfortable and discriminated against and i crossed the line			0
' as a political representative , there is a significant power differential with any constituent seeking help and particularly with your vulnerability of which i was aware			2
‘ you had a right to trust me			0
everyone should feel safe and should be able to have confidence in their political representatives and i am sorry i made you feel otherwise			0
i have learnt from my mistakes and pledge not to act in the same way again			0
’ he added : ‘ i also recognise that hurtful and untrue statements were made publicly about your motivation in bringing the claim			2
these statements sought to discredit and undermine you			0
‘ this should never have happened			0
i accept that you did not bring the claim for financial gain and any statements to the contrary were wrong			0
’ the 39 - year - old woman had attempted to complain about mr @entity0 ’s behaviour through the police , the office of the parliamentary commissioner for standards , as well as the @entity2 and @entity47 , but her solicitor said she had been ‘ blocked from achieving a remedy at each stage ’			1
in 2011 , a @entity132 woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four - year affair with @entity0 while she worked as his researcher			1
@entity136 ( right ) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she targeted the mp as part of a ‘ honeytrap ’ operation			2
during her time working with @entity0 , she even moved into his @entity12 flat			2
earlier that year , @entity0 admitted having a ‘ close and affectionate relationship ’ with a 17 - year - old girl			1
the pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience			0
‘ it was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual , ’ he said			2
‘ there was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that			0
’ in 2010 it was claimed that @entity0 had helped another @entity132 woman , 25 - year - old @entity158 , to stay in @entity159 after she ran into visa problems in the @entity161			1
miss @entity158 ’s ex-husband said the mp went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office			0
@entity0 was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the @entity168 and @entity161			2
the marriage of @entity170 , a @entity2 councillor and a mother of three , broke up as a result of their relationship			2
‘ i had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party , ’ she said			0
@entity0 was also said to have had a six - year affair with @entity182 , his constituency secretary			1
she told a newspaper : ‘ he ’s no great looker , he ’s not @entity186 ’s gift to women , but he charms his way in			0
’ there have also been allegations that @entity0 had a relationship with @entity191 , 20 , whom he met during an aid trip to a village near @entity194 in october 1990			2
she claimed : ‘ we were very close			0
i miss him very much			0
' he ’s a kind and charming man			0
he came on many trips , first in october 1990 , then @entity198 that year , then in january , march and april or may			0
i saw him each time			0
’ she said after the apology : ‘ i am pleased that there has finally been a resolution to what has been a long and hurtful ordeal for me			0
since the incidents about which i complained happened back in 2010 , my physical and mental health have suffered and i am grateful that i may now have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both myself and my son			0
’ the woman first met mr @entity0 in october 2009 at his constituency office in @entity214 , after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours			1
a year later , he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged sexual advances			1
he was never charged after police found there was no case to answer			0
in march 2011 , the woman complained about mr @entity0 to senior @entity2 officials at the party ’s @entity225 headquarters , but no action was taken against him			1
in a letter to mr @entity31 ’s office in february last year , she said mr @entity0 had exposed himself to her , made numerous unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her , but he was still not disciplined			1
@entity47 did ask @entity231 to investigate the allegations			0
but his report was never published and the @entity2 - controlled council voted to keep it under wraps			2
in his conclusions , mr @entity242 wrote : ‘ making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of @entity246 , i have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by mr @entity0			1
’ mr @entity0 was suspended from the @entity2 in january after the case became public .			1
