on a night where bitter rivals @entity8 came from behind to stun @entity11 champions @entity10 in @entity12 , @entity1 had to rely on a 67th minute strike to finally break the deadlock against @entity3			2
giving his half - time verdict on @entity32 , @entity5 said : ' there has been no reaction from the @entity1 players from the disappointment of last week			1
they do n't look like a team , just a collection of individuals running around			0
' you can defend players for making mistakes but you can not defend players for not tackling and not getting close to people			0
so close : @entity23 looks to the ground after putting his shot over the bar under pressure : @entity1 manager @entity15 shouts instructions at his team ' they ( @entity1 ) had a couple of good chances through @entity23 towards the end of the first half			1
he should certainly hit the target			0
i think it sums up his time at @entity1 , just not good enough			1
' @entity15 took the heat off the players before the game by saying it is his responsibility but we are talking about experienced players			0
' @entity29 's decision making , the chances he has taken , it is ridiculous			1
it is like his debut tonight			0
' as we said before the game , there are big question marks over the manager and the players			0
that for @entity1 is certainly not good enough			2
' hard night : @entity5 said @entity29 looked as though he was playing his debut			2

former *captain* says @entity1 ' do n't look like a team ' at the moment
keane targets winger @entity23 as ' just not good enough ' for the club
