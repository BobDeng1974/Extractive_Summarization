a baby girl was given hypothermia in order to keep her alive after she developed a potentially fatal brain condition			2
@entity4 suffered from @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood			1
to control the condition @entity12 was placed in a special cooling wrap within 40 minutes of her birth to keep her at the target temperature of 33.5 degrees for 72 hours			1
@entity17 and partner @entity18 with children @entity12 and @entity20 are raising money to help other children medics gave little @entity12 , pictured , hypothermia in a bid to prevent any brain damage @entity12 , pictured , was diagnosed with @entity5 minutes after she was born it allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen			1
thankfully , @entity12 , now ten months old , recovered from @entity5 and is able to feed and play			1
her parents , @entity33 and @entity18 , are hoping it will not have affected her ability to walk and talk but they must wait to find out			1
ms @entity4 , 27 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , said : ' @entity12 was in an incubator surrounded by doctors and nurses			0
' she was n't moving or breathing for herself , and was making no noise			0
' i had an image in my mind of our first cuddle which was taken away			0
doctors were telling us she was very poorly and just to take it hour by hour			0
' it was such a relief to bring her home			0
' @entity12 was born on may 10 last year weighing 7lbs 4oz after a normal pregnancy			2
she was whisked away by doctors immediately to be placed on a specialist cooling machine			1
despite her ordeal , @entity12 , who is now 10 months old , seems to be developing normally ms @entity4 , right , wants to raise £ 16,000 for additional cooling machines to help save other babies ms @entity4 said : ' my mum was a neonatal nurse for many years and i often visited her at work and would see all of these babies in their little incubators and see families in and out visiting their babies , but i never imagined it would be me			1
ms @entity4 said the next important stage is whether she will be able to walk and talk normally ' we could n't look to the days ahead and my mum told me to take lots of pictures			0
i knew what they were all trying to tell me , everyone thought she would n't make it			0
' i did n't move from her side for hours			0
i had the doctors and nurses tell me the worst case scenario so i could prepare myself , but it was very upsetting to hear she might not make it			0
' @entity18 was the opposite , he wanted to know the best possible outcome			1
' we were lucky that we were able to get @entity12 on one of the machines , otherwise we might not have been bringing her home			2
' @entity12 was born and treated at @entity86 , where there are only two cooling machines available			1
ms @entity4 said : ' we are extremely lucky that the last cooling machine was available for our daughter that day			2
' i 'm trying to raise money now for two cerebral function machines for the hospital , which monitor brain activity for any signs of brain damage , and , if i raise enough , another cooling machine for the neonatal unit			1
' my target is to raise at least £ 16,000			1
' her brother @entity20 , 10 , is doing a sponsored bike ride with his granddad to help too			0
' at his age he could have thought what happened to @entity12 was normal , but he came to see her every night and loves her to pieces			0
' @entity12 will need follow up appointments until she is two , but it is hoped she will make a full recovery			0
to donate go to : @entity110 ms @entity4 said without the cooling machine , @entity12 might not have survived her illness			2

@entity114 was born with @entity5 ( @entity115 )
medics had to put her on a special machine to help stop brain damage
now her parents @entity18 and @entity33 want to raise money for the hospital
the family want to raise £ 16,000 for two of the special cooling machines
