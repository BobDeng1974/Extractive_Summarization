it 's often been said crows show a remarkably high level of intelligence - they can remember faces , use tool , and communicate in sophisticated ways			1
but a new study has found they are even smarter than first thought , as they can solve complex tasks previously thought possible only by humans , apes and monkeys			1
and most impressively , they performed the tasks spontaneously - without any prior training			2
the study found they could solve a shape - association task ( shown )			1
it involved picking similar - but not matching - shapes to find food			1
two crows were found to be successful 78 per cent of the time the research , published in @entity32 , was carried out by psychology professor dr @entity33 from the @entity34 and three researchers from @entity20 in @entity21			1
' what the crows have done is a phenomenal feat , ' said dr @entity39 ' that 's the marvel of the results			2
it 's been done before with apes and monkeys , but now we 're dealing with a bird ; but not just any bird , a bird with a brain as special to birds as the brain of an apes is special to mammals			0
' researchers studying @entity55 crows recently discovered the clever corvids display a preference for holding a stick tool on a certain side of their beaks - and this could be to make the most of their wide field of vision			1
the researchers believe the birds may be trying to keep the tip of the stick in view of the eye on the opposite side of their heads , so they can see clearly in order to use tools in the most dexterous way			0
lead scientist dr @entity82 , from @entity83 , said : ‘ if you were holding a brush in your mouth and one of your eyes was better than the other at brush length , you would hold the brush so that its tip fell in view of the better eye			0
this is what the crows do			2
’ new @entity55 crows surprised experts with their ability to use sticks to extract larvae from burrows and , in captivity , retrieve food placed out of reach			1
the study , published in the journal @entity32 , also suggests that the birds ' unusually wide field of vision actually helps them to see better with one eye			1
the study involved two hooded crows that were at least two years old			1
the birds were placed into a wire mesh cage into which a plastic tray containing three small cups was occasionally inserted			0
the sample cup in the middle was covered with a small card on which a colour , shape or number of items was pictured			2
the other two cups were also covered with cards - one that matched the sample , and one that did n't			0
during this initial training period , the cup with the matching card contained two mealworms ; the crows were rewarded with these food items when they chose the matching card , but they received no food when they chose the other card			1
once the crows had been trained on identity matching - to - sample , the researchers moved to the second phase of the experiment			1
this time , the birds were assessed with relational matching pairs of items			1
these relational matching trials were arranged in such a way that the shapes on the test cards did not precisely matched the sample card , eliminating control by physical identity			1
for example , the crows might have to choose two same - sized circles rather than two different - sized circles when the sample card displayed two same - sized squares			2
' what the crows have done is a phenomenal feat , ' said dr @entity39			0
' that 's the marvel of the results			0
it 's been done before with apes and monkeys , but now we 're dealing with a bird ; but not just any bird , a bird with a brain as special to birds as the brain of an apes is special to mammals ' what surprised the researchers was not only that the crows could correctly perform the relational matches , with a success rate of 78 per cent - 50 per cent being regarded as chance - but that they did so spontaneously , without explicit training			1
' that is the crux of the discovery , ' dr @entity39 said			0
@entity21 researcher dr @entity177 studies a crow making the correct selection during a relational matching trial ' even if brute force methods had to be employed - by giving the crowns reward on correct trials and withholding reward on incorrect trials - successful learning and transfer of relational matching behavior would have been noteworthy			1
' ' the fact that the crows spontaneously engaged in correct relational matching makes the present results truly remarkable			2
' he added : ' this was a very artful experiment			0
' i was just bowled over by how innovative it was			0
' however , the researchers conceded that the earlier identity matching - to - sample training may have given them some background knowledge for this more complex test			1
nonetheless , even that in itself would be an ' intriguing matter for future study , ' they wrote in their paper			0
dr @entity208 , neurobiology and anatomy professor at the @entity212 - @entity211 , said the discovery ranks on par with demonstrations of tool use by some birds , including crows			2
' @entity222 reasoning , matching relations to relations , has been considered to be among the more so - called " higher order " abstract reasoning processes , ' he said			1
' for decades such reasoning has been thought to be limited to humans and some great apes			0
the apparent spontaneity of this finding makes it all the more remarkable			0
' dr @entity230 , director of research at the @entity232 in @entity233 , agreed the results shatter the notion that ' sophisticated forms of cognition can only be found in our " smart " human species			2
accumulated evidence suggests that animals can do more than expected			0
' dr @entity39 conceded there will be skeptics and hopes the experiment will be repeated with more crows as well as other species			0
he suspects researchers will have more such surprises in store for science			0
' we have always sold animals short , ' he said			0
' that human arrogance still permeates contemporary cognitive science			0

research led by @entity20 in @entity21 tested intelligence of crows
the study found they could solve a shape - association task
involved picking similar - but not matching - shapes to find food
two crows were found to be successful 78 per cent of the time
suggests crows have an even higher level of intelligence than thought
