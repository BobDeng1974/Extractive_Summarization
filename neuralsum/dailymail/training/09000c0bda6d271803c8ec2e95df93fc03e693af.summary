a church which had lead stolen from its roof has been refused an insurance payout – because it had scaffolding up			1
@entity4 ’s insurer says it is not covered as the poles ‘ helped ’ the thieves			1
burglars climbed the scaffolding , erected for a £ 220,000 restoration project , before stealing lead from a lightning conductor and a hatch at the top of its 100ft tower			2
the insurer said it did not cover properties when scaffolding is up as it ' helps thieves ' ( file image ) the vicar of the church in @entity23 believed the building was covered during the repair work as he had paid an extra £ 800 on top of its annual £ 1,500 premium			1
but insurer @entity29 says the policy contains a ‘ standard ’ clause stating it will not cover thefts while scaffolding is in use			1
church members have to foot the £ 2,000 to £ 3,000 replacement bill themselves			0
the vicar , father @entity38 , said : ‘ it does seem rather odd and unfair and makes us wonder why we were actually paying for the extra cover			0
maybe it is something people need to be aware of			0
’ the @entity44 said most home insurance policies have no specific caveat regarding scaffolding			0
but if it was found a scaffold had aided thieves , a policy could be invalidated because of the owner ’s lack of ‘ due care or attention ’			0
a spokesman for @entity29 said the church knew theft was not covered while scaffolding was up			2
she added : ‘ it is a standard exclusion applied by @entity29 on all church policies			2

@entity61 in @entity23 told scaffolding ' helped ' thieves
@entity29 , their insurer , is refusing to pay for stolen lead as result
claims there is a clause in *contract* which excludes thefts while scaffolding is put up
