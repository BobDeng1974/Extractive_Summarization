by @entity1 reporter published : 02:55 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 02:55 est , 19 june 2012 destructive : researchers have found the two cyber weapons are connected @entity6 frustrated by their inability to stop sophisticated hacking attacks are taking retaliatory action , sometimes outside the law , experts say			1
known in the cybersecurity industry as ' active defense ' or ' strike - back ' technology , the reprisals range from modest steps to distract and delay a hacker to more controversial measures			1
security experts say they even know of some cases where companies have taken action that could violate laws in the @entity22 or other countries , such as hiring contractors to hack the assailant 's own systems			1
in the past , companies that have been attacked have mostly focused on repairing the damage to their computer networks and shoring them up to prevent future breaches			1
but with malicious software widely available on the internet for anyone wanting to cause trouble , prevention is increasingly difficult and companies are growing more aggressive			1
' not only do we put out the fire , but we also look for the arsonist , ' said @entity42 , a former head of cybercrime investigations at the @entity44			2
in april he joined new cybersecurity company @entity45 , which aims to provide clients with a menu of active responses			2
once a company detects a network breach , rather than expel the intruder immediately , it can waste the hacker 's time and resources by appearing to grant access to tempting material that proves impossible to extract			2
companies can also allow intruders to make off with bogus files or ' beacons ' that reveal information about the thieves ' own machines , experts say			1
mr @entity42 and @entity45 co-founder @entity67 do not recommend that companies try to breach their opponent 's computers , but they say the private sector does need to fight back more boldly against cyber espionage			1
it is commonplace for law firms to have their emails hacked and read during negotiations for ventures in @entity78 , mr @entity67 told the @entity79 and @entity80			1
that has given the other side tremendous leverage because they know the @entity86 client company 's strategy , including the most they would be willing to pay for a certain stake			2
but if a company knows its lawyers will be hacked , it can plant false information and get the upper hand			1
' deception plays an enormous role , ' mr @entity67 said			2
flame : the sophisticated virus has been used to spy on computer systems other security experts say a more aggressive posture is unlikely to have a significant impact in the near term in the overall fight against cybercriminals and @entity35 espionage			2
veteran government and private officials warn that much of the activity is too risky to make sense , citing the chances for escalation and collateral damage			0
' there is no business case for it and no possible positive outcome , ' said @entity118 , a @entity119 and @entity121 veteran who leads research firm @entity123 's internet security practice			1
nevertheless , the movement shows the deep anger and sense of futility among security professionals , many of whom feel that a bad situation is getting worse , endangering both their companies and the national economy			1
' there 's nothing you can do ' to keep determined and well - financed hackers out , said @entity138 , senior technologist at internet infrastructure company @entity139 and an advisor to the @entity141 on cybersecurity			0
mr @entity138 recently looked at 168 of the largest 500 @entity22 companies by revenue and found evidence in @entity139 forensic logs that 162 of them owned machines that at some point had been transmitting data out to hackers			1
frustration by security professionals is not new			0
some privately admitted to rooting for @entity154 last year during that hacking group 's unprecedented spree of public crimes , when it broke into and embarrassed @entity159 , an @entity44 affiliate and others with routine hacking techniques			1
they said the resulting media coverage finally caught the attention of @entity165 and legislators , although tougher cybersecurity laws have yet to pass @entity168			0
collaboration : experts say they have found evidence that the two programmes shared the same source code although some strike - backs have occurred quietly in the past , @entity174 popularised going on offensive , said @entity177 , founder of the influential @entity179 security conferences and an advisor to the @entity181			0
in january , @entity174 named some of the @entity184 players behind the malicious ' @entity186 ' software that spread through spam on various social networks , earning the gang an estimated $ 2million			0
the security industry 's shortcomings were underscored most recently by the discovery of the @entity194 spying virus in the @entity195			0
@entity196 , the well - regarded chief research officer at @entity198 's @entity197 , told the @entity199 his company had a sample of @entity194 in 2010 and classified it as clean and later missed another virus called @entity203 that was suspected of being backed by @entity86 governments			0
' these are examples how we are failing ' as an industry , mr @entity196 said			0
' consumer - grade antivirus you buy from the store does not work too well trying to detect stuff created by the nation - states with nation - state budgets			1
' because some national governments are suspected in attacks on private @entity86 companies , it is natural that some of the victims want to join their own governments to fight back			1
' it 's time to have the debate about what the actions would be for the private sector , ' former @entity119 director @entity221 said at the @entity228 security conference held earlier this year in @entity229			0
in april , @entity181 secretary @entity230 told the @entity231 that officials had been contemplating authorising even ' proactive ' private - entity attacks , although there has been little follow - up comment			2
many large security providers no longer preach that keeping the enemy out is paramount			0
instead , they adopt the more recent line taken by the @entity240 , which is to assume that hackers have gotten inside and will again			0
the mainstream advice now is to focus on trying to detect suspicious activity as quickly as possible in order to shut it down			0
hitting back with force is only the most colorful of possible responses after that			0
more common alternatives include deep analysis of what data has been sent out and attempts to learn whether the recipients were competitors , criminals who might try to resell it , or national governments , who might be inclined to share it with local industry			0
some experts also say executives should identify their most prized intellectual property and keep it off of networked computers and consider evasive action - such as having 100 versions of a critical digitised blueprint and only one that is genuine , with the right one never identified in emails			2
' there is a reason that people fly halfway around the world to have a one - hour meeting , ' mr @entity138 said of intelligence agencies .			0

range of companies now offering retaliatory services to companies facing hacking attacks
firms are routinely hacked and emails read while preparing to do business in @entity78
many viruses and hacking attacks now appear to be state sponsored
