by @entity0 , science correspondent it ’s often said you are what you eat			2
but it seems that what your mother ate is also important			2
research points to a woman ’s diet before she becomes pregnant affecting the genes of her future child			1
preparation : a woman 's diet before she becomes pregnant affects the genes of her future child , new research suggests what is more , pre-conception diet may have a life - long impact on the as yet unborn child ’s health			1
researcher @entity20 , of the @entity21 , said : ‘ the key message is that a mother ’s nutrition before she becomes pregnant is super-critical			1
‘ there is a lot going on before the moment of conception			0
’ the science is still in its infancy , but it could lead to women who want to start a family being advised to take a cocktail of vitamins and other food supplements ahead of pregnancy			1
to pin down the effect of a mother ’s diet on health , professor @entity20 studied women in rural @entity42 , where the marked seasons lead to distinct changes in the foods eaten			1
working with colleagues from the @entity48 ’s unit in the @entity49 , he measured the concentration of various nutrients in the blood of nearly 170 newly - pregnant women			1
@entity54 had conceived at the height of the rainy season and half had become pregnant at the peak of the dry season			2
stocking up : good sources of the nutrients needed to make chemical changes include milk , green leafy vegetables and protein he also scrutinised the dna of their babies after they were born and quizzed other local women about their diet through the seasons			1
crunching the results together showed a clear link between a woman ’s diet and her child ’s genes			2
crucially , it was what she ate before pregnancy that was important – not what eaten when carrying the child			0
the difference involved ‘ epigenetic ’ changes to the baby ’s dna			0
these are n’t mutations but chemical changes that affect when genes become active and how active they are			2
not all of our genes are active all of the time , and if they are under or over-active , it can cause problems			0
building blocks : choline , found in eggs , in another influential nutrient , the study found it is not known if the changes found here affect health but , in other work , professor @entity20 has found linked pre-pregnancy diet to the chemistry of genes involved in obesity , cancer and the immune system			1
some changes can be erased over time , others are life - long			0
nutrients needed to make the chemical changes include vitamins @entity120 , @entity122 and @entity123 , as well as choline and methionine and folic acid			1
professor @entity20 said that while it is too early to give advice , good sources of these compounds include , milk , green , leafy vegetables and protein			0
women are already advised to take folic acid , or vitamin b9 in the run - up to pregnancy			1
the professor said : ‘ now research is pointing to the need for a cocktail of nutrients , which could come from the diet or from supplements			2
‘ what is pretty thrilling is that we seem to have hit on something that has worldwide consequences for women trying to conceive			0
’ variations : the diet differences involved ' epigenetic ' changes to the baby 's dna ( pictured )			0
these are chemical changes that affect when genes become active and how active they are almost ten years ago , scientists showed the nutrients in a mouse ’s diet before pregnancy can alter the colour of the coat of her future pup			1
the latest research , published in the journal @entity171 , is the first to definitively link preconception diet with epigenetic changes in people			0
it is part of a growing body of research that points to a child ’s health being programmed early in life – including in the womb and even before conception			0
it is argued that these early days shape a child ’s chances of everything from developing diabetes in their 40s and 50s to having a heart attack in old age			0
it is even said that life expectancy can be traced back to those early days and months , as can a lifelong battle of the bulge .			0

mother ’s nutrition before she becomes pregnant is ' super-critical '
nutrients needed to make chemical changes that affect @entity154 include vitamins @entity120 , @entity122 and @entity123 , plus choline - found in eggs - and folic acid
findings could lead to cocktail of vitamins being taken before pregnancy
