it became a symbol of brutal @entity3 aggression - an unprovoked torpedo attack on a passenger cruise liner during the @entity6			1
the infamous sinking of the @entity8 in 1915 , killing more than 1,000 innocent victims , sparked outrage in @entity11 and @entity12			1
public opinion in the @entity14 swung against the @entity15 - eventually helping president @entity16 take the country into the war in 1917			0
but 70 years after the ship was torpedoed by a @entity3 u-boat eight miles off the coast of @entity23 , @entity11 government officials feared the secret of the tragedy would ' blow up on us ' when a group of divers planned to search the wreck			1
@entity30 off the coast of @entity23 after being torpedoed by a @entity3 u-boat proved a major turning point in the war the unprovoked attack on the @entity8 sparked outrage in @entity11 , @entity23 and @entity12			1
but the @entity3 always insisted that the ship was packed with explosives from the @entity14 destined for the @entity37 the @entity3 high command always maintained the steam liner , traveling between @entity40 and @entity41 , was carrying explosives destined for the @entity37 concealed as cheese or casks of beef			1
but ministers at the time rejected the claim and used the attack to whip up public anger against the @entity3			2
' take up the sword of justice – avenge the @entity8 ' read one famous poster			2
the campaign was used effectively in @entity23 , where conscription was not compulsory			2
however , secret government documents released under the 30 - year - rule this week reveal that the @entity3 claims may have been right all along			2
after salvage companies applied to raise the 790ft @entity62 liner in 1982 , the government fired off warnings about danger to life , according to the @entity67 documents			0
the sinking was a tragedy for more than a 1,000 men , women and children who died - but it was used relentlessly by the @entity59 to convince @entity74 and @entity75 sceptics to help defeat ' the hun '			1
@entity74 men were urged to ' take up the sword of justice - avenge the @entity8 ' amid widespread public disgust over the torpedo attack			1
a series of posters were produced featuring pictures of the dramatic scene			0
@entity75 fury over the attack swung public opinion firmly onto the side of the allies - and against the @entity3			2
this helped president @entity16 take the @entity12 into the war in 1917			1
officials feared attempts to survey the wreck would reveal an illegal stash of ammunition - discrediting one of the key reasons why the the @entity12 were dragged into the war			1
files show that the @entity100 even went as far as warning divers that the wreck could contain explosives			0
@entity105 files show that officials feared the controversy would ' literally blow up on us ' denting @entity11 's special relationship with the @entity12			1
there were also concerns that @entity75 survivors and relatives of those who died could sue the government			0
in a secret memo , @entity115 , from the @entity105 's @entity75 department , said : ' successive @entity11 governments have always maintained that there was no munitions on board the @entity8 ( and that the @entity3 were therefore in the wrong to claim to the contrary as an excuse for sinking the ship )			1
' the facts are that there is a large amount of ammunition in the wreck , some of which is highly dangerous			0
' he added : ' i am left with the uneasy feeling that this subject may yet - literally - blow up on us			0
' the @entity8 was steaming from @entity40 to @entity41 when she was hit by the @entity137 on may 7 , 1915			1
the explosives , after being hit by the @entity3 torpedo , sparked a larger blast causing the giant liner - a sister ship of the @entity143 - to sink in just 18 minutes			1
the government has admitted that there were 4,200 ' small arms ' cartridges and ammunition cases on the ship - and these were declared at the time			0
but they were not classified as ' ammunition '			0
experts claim these could not have been responsible for the second giant explosion which sunk the liner			2
a senior government lawyer , @entity155 , warned there could still be a political scandal if it was found that there had actually been explosives on board			0
' it can not be denied that the sinking of the @entity8 did much to sway @entity75 opinion in favour of entering the war , ' he wrote			1
' if it were now to come to light that there was after all some justification , however slight , for the torpedoing , @entity167 's relations with @entity12 could well suffer			2
' the @entity11 's relationship with @entity12 was crucial in 1982 - at the height of the @entity174			1
it was also the year in which @entity11 troops marched into @entity178 in the @entity179			2
@entity180 and @entity181 , pictured here in 1982 , were @entity174 allies			0
@entity11 could not risk damaging the relationship at this time by allowing revelations to emerge that the @entity8 had been piled high with explosives destined for @entity41 after setting sail in @entity40 , the @entity8 sank in just 18 minutes eight miles off the coast of @entity23 @entity190 , captain of the @entity8			1
he survived the attack which killed more than 1,000 civilians among those who died in the tragedy included politicians , artists , academics and businessmen , as well as the art collector , sir @entity199 , who is said to have been carrying paintings by @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 in sealed containers			1
since 1982 , there have been a number of dives and surveys of the wreck , including one in 2012 which found no evidence of any high explosives and concluded the second blast reported by some of the 761 survivors was one of the ships boilers exploding			0
however the wreck ’s owner , @entity218 , an entrepreneur , from @entity220 , who has been trying for 40 years to find out if the ship had a secret military cargo , has asked the @entity224 to sanction further dives to prove his theory			0
in 1918 a @entity40 judge had ruled that there were 4,200 cases of safety cartridges , 18 fuse cases and 125 shrapnel cases without any powder charge on board the liner when it went down			0
but he ruled that these did not constitute ' war munitions '			0
he added that the @entity8 had not been armed or carried any high explosives			1
the 1915 @entity11 inquiry into the @entity30 , chaired by @entity241 , barely touched on the issue			2
but when a @entity245 survivor , @entity244 , a former army officer , claimed that the ship had sunk so quickly because of a second explosion , his testimony was quickly dismissed			2
mr @entity244 , who had been in the second - class dining room , said the explosion was ' similar to the rattling of a maxim gun for a short period ' and came from underneath the whole floor			0
but @entity241 said : ' i do not believe him			0
his demeanour was very unsatisfactory			0
there was no confirmation of his story			0
