more than two million migratory birds were deliberately killed in @entity11 last autumn , according to new data			1
the birds , which cost 80 euros ( £ 86 ) for a dozen , are a local delicacy known as ambelopoulia			1
the illegal activity has now caused a drastic drop in the numbers of blackcaps , robins and songbirds and has been dubbed ' out of control '			0
a spokesman for the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , a partner of @entity27 , described the issue as ' trapping on an industrial level '			0
he said : ' we are hoping that we can begin to get a grip and would like the @entity2 base of @entity33 to help clear the acacia , which trappers plant to lure in birds			1
' it is so obvious when it is taking place			0
it is easy to detect and easy to see where it has been planted			0
we accept it is a difficult job but we would like to see some commitment to a timetable			0
' unfortunately last year the action the @entity2 military took was too late because it was after the trapping season			2
' at the moment the @entity48 are arguing with our figures but everybody needs to work together			1
' trapping itself has been illegal since 1974 and it is against the laws and regulations of the base area			0

nearly 4,000 poachers are believed to be involved in the autumn trapping season - much higher than in summer because the birds are plumper			2
@entity79 , @entity27 ' chief , said poaching was a ' serious , persistent and growing problem '			0
she added that it ' has been the worst year with the highest trapping levels since the start of the monitoring programme in 2002 '			2
the trappers connect mp3 players or cd players to car batteries and speakers hidden in the bushes			0
they then play birdsong and lure birds into hidden nets an official checks a huge haul of hundreds of dead birds taken from trappers in @entity11 @entity27 has also called for tougher sentencing but admitted attitudes towards killing and eating migratory birds would have to change to make a difference			1
poachers that are caught can currently receive penalties of up to three years in jail and fines as high as 17,000 euros ( £ 12,215 )			2
a @entity48 spokeswoman said : ' we do not accept the report ’s unverified claims about loss of bird life during this period , which was based upon data collected from a very short period			1
' we are committed to tackling poaching which is why we arrested nearly 50 poachers and seized 450 nets and 286 piece of poaching equipment during the last migration period			2
when we catch poachers we can fine them € 17,000 , or send them to prison for up to 3 years			0
' we continue to work with local organisations to discuss how we can work as effectively as possible			0

the birds can be sold for 80 euros a dozen to *restaurants* and cafes
nearly ten miles of nets and 6,000 limesticks were *recovered* last year
limesticks are covered in glue to trap birds when they go to perch
