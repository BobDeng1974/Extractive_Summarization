@entity0 will be able to extend his stay at @entity2 further into 2015 if his parent club @entity3 decide to hold a pre-season training camp in @entity6			1
@entity0 has quickly become an integral part of @entity9 ’s thinking at the @entity10 , having impressed with goals and match - winning performances since joining on loan from @entity2 's sister club in august			1
with the @entity20 @entity19 season due to start in march and the 36 - year - old initially expected to head to @entity22 for pre-season sometime in the @entity24 , suggestions that @entity2 may try to keep hold of him a little longer have caused some consternation across the @entity26			1
@entity0 could be at @entity2 until february if @entity22 agree to pre-season training in @entity28 the @entity2 loanee has bagged some important goals so far this term and could see his deal extended however , it is understood one possibility that could help satisfy both clubs is @entity22 using the @entity6 club ’s new @entity37 training facility as a base for their own pre-season training camp in january or february			1
recently opened , the theory is that @entity2 ’s new £ 200m facility could host @entity3 for training and accommodation while the @entity19 team play two or three friendly games against local lower league opposition in the @entity49			0
this would enable @entity0 to meet and spend time with his new team - mates while continuing to play for @entity2 as the @entity3 players went through stages of pre-season fitness work that he would n’t need			2
@entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity2 with new team - mate @entity57 the former @entity59 star has been impressive in midfield for @entity9 's side so far this term city are aware the issue of @entity0 ’s availability is a sensitive one in @entity20 , where @entity3 have used the former @entity28 player ’s impending arrival in marketing drives and to boost season ticket sales			1
however , @entity0 has already proved valuable to @entity9 , scoring four times before injuring his thigh against @entity71 last weekend			0
the former @entity59 star has said he will leave the decision about his future to the two clubs			0
@entity0 has been a major hit at the @entity10 and even netted against his former side @entity59 meanwhile , @entity0 has an outside chance of recovering from injury ahead of @entity2 ’s visit to another of his old clubs , @entity81 , on saturday			2
@entity0 missed the @entity83 trip to @entity84 after being carried off on a stretcher against @entity71 last saturday , but his thigh injury is not a serious one			0
it is understood he remains a doubt for the trip to @entity91 but if he does miss the match he should be back for next week			0
@entity0 was voted @entity2 ’s player of the month for september by fans and has already scored four goals for the club			2
the former @entity28 midfielder picked up a thigh injury in @entity2 's win over @entity71 last weekend			0

@entity0 *signed* for @entity2 on loan from sister club
his *current* deal runs out in january but @entity2 may look to extend it
