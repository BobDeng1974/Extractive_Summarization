@entity65 understands that the complainant is worried about air conditioning units being attached to the mansion , because of the visual impact and the humming noise			1
his letter said : ' the council must identifed ( sic ) our deep concerns about all adverse impacts on living conditions from noise , vibration , dirt , pollution and dust from construction and from associated traffic , in addition to concerns about impacts on drainage , on appearance and landscape , on structural stability , and on historic buildings			2

she said : ' the @entity24 ' home has got very grand proportions , it is a trophy home			0
you do n't get that many coming up for sale as many of these homes have been turned into flats			0
' with planning on a home like this it is perfectly normal to take this long			0
' the work will probably cost around £ 500 - £ 600 per sq / ft so it will cost around £ 5 million to do			2
' when the work is done , it will be a brilliant home for a family			0
' there are good schools in the area , there is the park and the @entity225 is nearby			0
' i am sure when the work it is complete , it will be in good taste and they 'd look to get £ 4,000 per sq / ft for it			0
' old pad : the @entity24 reportedly sold @entity17 , pictured , for £ 11.5million - a tidy £ 9million profit this would value the property at £ 42 million			1
