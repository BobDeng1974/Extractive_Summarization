by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 08:27 est , 4 july 2013 with its rusting interior and basic conditions , it 's hard to believe that many of @entity8 's most deadly @entity7 attacks were partly masterminded here			0
but this cramped bomb damaged bunker hidden away in the remote @entity12 countryside outside @entity13 was the hiding place from which top officers in the @entity16 co-ordinated the @entity17 in the latter part of @entity19			1
the site , codenamed @entity21 , or @entity22 , was one of the few spared victorious @entity25 forces at the end of the war			1
and a stern ' @entity28 ' sign - ' keep out ' in @entity29 - and rumours that there is still live munitions on the site did n't deter @entity35 photographer @entity34 from tracking down the bunker and taking these fascinating pictures			1
' it was badly damaged as the war was coming to an end , of course , but then the @entity64 destroyed most of what remained			2
' they used the underground bunker and another building as a munitions depot , though , and so these were spared			2
' the bunker seems to have taken on the characteristics of a submarine - maybe out of solidarity for the u-boat crews			0
' going underground : the eerie remains of the bunker sit around 10 metres below the surface not far from @entity13 warning signs : despite signs telling people to stay out of the bunker , @entity34 managed to get inside and take a fascinating set of photos secrets of the past : the rusting bunking was the base for @entity7 operations in the latter part of the @entity19 abandoned : @entity34 can not understand why such interesting remnants of history are now left empty and to rot building on the bunker began in 1939 when it was originally intended to be used as a naval intelligence school			1
but when allied bombs began dropping on @entity13 it was deemed a good idea to move naval high command out of the city and into the bunker			2
the @entity100 was effectively run from @entity21 from january 1943 , with @entity7 operations in the @entity102 controlled under the direction of @entity104			0
the bunker was damaged in an air raid in april 1945 as the war begun to draw to a close and the @entity25 took it over just days later			1
time capsule : remnants of @entity8 use of the bunker as well as their @entity25 enemies who seized the base at the end of the war are still visible original features : gas and electric pipes that powered the bunker when it was a @entity8 military nerve centre still line the walls dark : @entity34 recommends taking a torch if you are brave enough to explore the ruins of the bunker historic : the bunker was seized by the @entity25 days after it suffered severe damage in an air raid although they destoryed much of the overground part of the base , they kept part of the underground space and are said to have used it as a weapons store			1
@entity133 were responsible for destroying more than 2,700 @entity135 ships during the course of @entity19 and historians have previously suggested that @entity138 was close to losing the war because u-boats were destroying vital goods and food necessary for the war effort			2
@entity34 said : ' i think most people are also interested in these stories			0
. ' it â€™s crazy to think that buildings of such historical importance are simply abandoned and forgotten			0
' i think these places should be preserved for historical reasons so people can learn from mistakes of the past and avoid making them again in future			0
' @entity156 : the entrance to the bunker is down a steep ladder			0

@entity21 , or @entity38 , was the hidden base of top @entity16 commanders during @entity19
it was one of the few *strategic* spaces spared by @entity25 forces at the end of the war in 1945
a stern ' @entity170 ' sign did n't deter @entity35 photographer @entity34 from finding the bunker and exploring it
the bunker is hidden away in the @entity12 countryside outside @entity13 , close to the *village* of @entity176
