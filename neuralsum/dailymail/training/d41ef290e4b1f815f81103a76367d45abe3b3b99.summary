by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam there is a statue in the @entity5 's living room of himself , allegedly carved from marble and life - size			1
the @entity9 @entity8 has just nominated sir @entity10 to throw ice on himself			0
it 's fair to say @entity13 and @entity14 have made peculiar decisions			1
but what of @entity17 ? the combined outlay for that pair was £ 42m			1
this week , @entity13 has returned to @entity20 on loan as part of the move that brought @entity24 to @entity25			1
the 27 - year - old 's annual wages of £ 4.7m will be covered in their entirety by @entity17			1
a good deal for @entity20 , certainly			2
but also an indication of where @entity13 stands at @entity17 after seven years at the club			1
his contract is up next year and on thursday morning , @entity47 , such is its vulnerability , listed his club as @entity50			2
suffice to say , things have not worked out quite as expected , even if @entity13 has shown considerably more of his talent than his hungry team - mate , who for a while has been a figure of fun			1
last summer , when @entity58 and @entity57 discussed @entity14 during @entity60 's @entity59 , @entity57 said : ' i bring him his burger at 1 o'clock			1
' a joke said endearingly about a popular player , of course , but fitness has been an obvious problem for a player who is still only 26			0
in 70 starts , he has been substituted 51 times and finished only 19 games			0
he has scored five @entity74 goals and never more than two in a season			0
belly up : @entity14 celebrates with @entity77 after a goal against @entity79 in the @entity80 last february not fit for purpose : @entity14 has struggled with injury and concerns over his all - round physical condition cheeky : @entity14 's wikipedia page has been changed by those poking fun at the midfielder it 's horribly disappointing for a so - called box - to - box midfielder , a player who @entity10 believed could fill gaps left by @entity8 and later @entity94			1
unlike @entity95 , a terrible flop since moved on to @entity97 , @entity17 did their homework on @entity14			1
@entity10 wrote in his most recent book about his brother @entity100 's excitement on a scouting trip to @entity103			2
' i sent @entity100 to watch him in every game for four or five weeks , ' he wrote			0
' @entity100 said , " @entity10 , he 's better than @entity106 "			0
' " for @entity108 's sake , do n't say that " , i told him			0
" he 'll need to be good to be better than @entity106			0
' @entity13 's case has been less clear - cut			1
like @entity14 , he has been saddled with a comparison			2
it is not something he designed or encouraged , save for his early preference of extra stepovers , but he has been forced to compete against an aura he can not match			0
@entity5 , quite possibly , is the greatest @entity17 player that has lived			2
in that shadow , he has had significant high points			0
three years ago he was named the club 's players ' player of the year award			2
he was part of the 23 - man shortlist for the @entity125			0
he also scored @entity17 's fifth penalty as they beat @entity127 in the 2008 @entity129 final and won four league titles and a league cup			1
but he was so inconsistent			0
he 's been on the periphery for two seasons and scored only one league goal in that time			0
he was always more adept at assisting , capable in his work on either wing , but the spark seems to have gone for a player contracted until 2018			0
he 's still only 27 , but like his statue , his @entity17 career has stood still			1
@entity14 's never really got going			2
head over heels : @entity13 has had an up - and - down career at @entity17 , but has finally been shipped out theatrics : the @entity35 winger has failed to live up to high expectations at @entity25 @entity147 reach deal for @entity24			1

@entity13 has **joined** @entity20 on season - long loan
@entity14 is *unwanted* at @entity17 but the club can not find a buyer
the duo **joined** @entity17 for combined £ 42m in 2007
@entity156 have become figures of *derision* during @entity17 's recent struggles
