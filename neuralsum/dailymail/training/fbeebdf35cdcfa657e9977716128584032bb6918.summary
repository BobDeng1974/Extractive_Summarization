after decades of trying to shake off the shadow of @entity2 , fears are growing that @entity3 is once more embracing the @entity5 ’s evil beliefs			1
the far @entity6 continues to attract young recruits with its message of racism and arrogance			2
and now an alarm bell has been sounded by the country ’s biggest news magazine			2
@entity15 analysis : ' @entity16 ' on the shelf : the magazine is one of the largest news sources in @entity21 @entity16 says the heady days of partying epitomised when @entity3 hosted the @entity22 in 2006 are long gone			1
it concludes : ‘ the reality is that there is hardly anything that interests the @entity3 as much about themselves as their relationship to the @entity2 era			1
’ in a lengthy essay , the journal says : ‘ this year , amid fresh debates over xenophobia , many are left wondering if the ugly @entity3 is back			1
' when the @entity36 or the @entity37 protest against the supposed dictatorship of the @entity3 in euro policy , some of their posters depict @entity41 motifs			1
@entity2 , pictured in january 1935 , casts a long shadow over @entity3 , says @entity16 ' when @entity44 author @entity43 recently travelled through @entity3 , he discovered plenty of @entity46			1
we ’re back where we did n’t want to be , caught in the spell of a @entity41 past , one that also dominates the present			0
‘ when we look back at the media reports of 2012 , there is much about this year that hints at the country ’s @entity41 past			0
and there does n’t seem to be anything left of the happy , cosmopolitan @entity3 of 2006 , nor of the exciting summer of 2010 , when a young @entity3 team thrilled the world with its coltish and offensive approach to football at the @entity22 in @entity65			1
‘ many of the players were children of immigrants , and @entity3 came across as a relaxed , multicultural nation			2
‘ at the end of 2012 , it seems as if we are the gloomy @entity3 once again , the @entity3 who either can not or do n’t want to shed their horrific past			2
it seems that it ’s time for us to adjust our self - image once again			2
‘ we can celebrate as exuberantly as we wish , and we can play football as magnificently as we sometimes do , and yet the @entity41 story will be with us for a long time to come			0

yet they did nothing to stop it murdering nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman in a 13 - year reign of terror which included bank robberies and bombings			0
while these and many other stories played out , the far @entity6 continued its insidious corruption of the young			0
