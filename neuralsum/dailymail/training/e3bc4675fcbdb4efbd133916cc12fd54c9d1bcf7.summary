the infamous ' @entity1 ' banner that celebrated @entity3 ' arrival at @entity4 looks set to be auctioned off for charity			1
the banner took pride of place in the @entity10 last season after @entity3 was anointed as @entity4 's manager by his illustrious predecessor sir @entity12			2
however , after a traumatic tenure that lasted only nine months , the banner was taken down and is now lying in an @entity16 storage room			1
the ' @entity18 ' banner is displayed at @entity16 during @entity3 ' reign in charge ' @entity25 banner is still in a storage room at @entity16 , ' @entity22 of fans ’ group @entity21 told the @entity27			1
' @entity4 have actually told us that it needs collecting as it belongs to us , but we just have n’t got round to it yet			0
' @entity30 had been keen to have it , but they have n’t been back in touch , so we will probably look to auction it for charity now			0
' we have auctioned a couple of banners in the past - we raised £ 2,000 for @entity38 ’s charity by selling one of his - so it would be nice to do something similar with the @entity1			0
' @entity43 has learned that the group also turned down a £ 2,000 offer for the banner from a @entity4 supporter just after @entity3 was sacked by the club in april , while there has also been mischievous interest from rival fans			1
the banner became a serious bone of contention as the @entity56 ' reign disintegrated in the second half of last season and many fans wanted the group to remove the sign before the @entity62 home game against @entity63 in march			0
a general view of the banner at @entity16 which is now set to be auctioned off for charity ' we raised the money for the banner quicker than any of the previous ones , ' @entity22 added			1
' because sir @entity12 had asked for the fans to back @entity3 , this seemed a good way to do it			2
' it was also unveiled for a home game against @entity76 so there was a bit of dig at @entity80 in there as well			0
' i do n’t think @entity3 ever liked it and , when fans began to call for it to be removed , we planned to hold a vote the day after the @entity88 game in april , but @entity3 was sacked the same day , so the decision was made for us			2
