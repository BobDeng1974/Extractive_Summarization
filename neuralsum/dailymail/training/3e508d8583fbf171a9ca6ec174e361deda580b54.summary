she received the lethal injection for murdering her husband and stepson in 2002 in order to claim life insurance			0
although @entity12 's trial has drawn global attention for the brutal killing of boyfriend @entity1 , twisted lies and sordid details of sex , there is much gruesome competition among previous death row inmates			1

she gave the interviews on tuesday after the judge lifted an order barring jail officials from arranging any media requests			2

@entity12 said she wanted at least three people called as witnesses who could have testified to having seen bruises on her neck ' when i was choked out ' by @entity191 but she said she was rebuffed by her lawyers			1
the prosecutor insisted her claims of self - defense were an exaggerated attempt to avoid being convicted			2
she said her lawyers ' felt a little betrayed ' and blindsided by her post-conviction interview but that they gave their blessings for tuesday night 's interviews , warning her to be cautious			0
@entity12 said she sometimes wishes she 'd never met @entity191 , ' just because of how ultimately everything ended and i say that for his sake and mine - not just a selfish thing '			1
fashion statement : the murderer accessorized her @entity165 uniform with a wool sweater and open - toe sandals ... and shackles she said if the attack never occurred and she never crossed paths with the victim , she would likely now be a happily married 32 - year - old with children , good finances and a successful wedding photography business			0

' i want everyone 's healing to begin , and i want everyone 's pain to stop			0
' ranting : convicted killer @entity1 tearfully pleaded with jurors to spare her from a death sentence on tuesday during a bizarre 25 - minute testimony @entity12 stabbed and slashed @entity191 nearly 30 times , shot in him in the forehead and slit his throat , nearly decapitating him , before leaving his body in his shower to be found by friends about five days later			1

but i know that i was , ' @entity12 told jurors			2
' and for that , i 'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life			0

they also argued for a mistrial			0
the judge denied both requests			0
@entity191 's family showed little emotion as @entity12 ' mother , father and sister looked on from the other side of the gallery and cried			2

' the question now before you is : do you kill her ? do you kill her for the one act that she did , the one horrible act , or can you see that there is a reason to let her live ? can you see that there is value in her life ? ' she said			0
prosecutor @entity311 said that despite @entity12 ' claims , there were no factors in the case that would warrant a sentence other than death			1
