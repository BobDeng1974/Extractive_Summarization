by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 9 february 2013 updated : 17:03 est , 9 february 2013 with an automatic rifle slung over her shoulder and her sights trained on @entity7 territory , @entity1 looks every inch a frontline soldier			1
her role as a supply driver takes her deep into the war zone			1
she has been engaged by the enemy and is expected to eliminate any insurgent who poses a lethal threat to her colleagues			1
given that responsibility , @entity1 , 25 , is a soldier first and a woman second			1
everything about her appearance is geared towards operational effectiveness			1
her mousy hair is pulled up inside her helmet , her body armour is strapped tightly to her torso and her @entity31 rifle is fully loaded , with 30 high - explosive rounds ready for firing			1
overall , @entity1 comes across as a contented soldier who relishes her role as part of 12 @entity36			1
and , as the name of her unit suggests , she is seldom far from the action			1
in the line of fire : army driver @entity1 , 25 , is angry at @entity43 ban that thwarts her dream role in the infantry but one aspect of military life perturbs @entity1 – that , as a woman , she is banned from transferring to any regiment in the infantry or the armoured corps			1
the decision appears blatant discrimination by the @entity43 and it is now under scrutiny following a landmark step in @entity59 allowing women to fill all military roles			1
‘ if a woman is good enough , why not ? our infantry should definitely be opened up to female recruits , ’ says @entity1 , fixing me with a steely gaze			1
‘ we carry the same amount of kit as the guys , we ’re trained the same and we do many of the same jobs			1
‘ if it is opened up , i would certainly be tempted			1
do the boys want us to join ? i ’m not sure			1
we work very hard and we deserve the chance			1
i am fit – i do a lot of running – and while some men might be fitter , by no means all are			1
i want a challenge , that is why i joined the @entity80			1
before that i was working in an office for four years			1
‘ i knew i had to get out of there and find something more exciting			1
’ @entity1 certainly shows no signs of wilting under the dangers and hardships she endures – the dusty conditions and the sleep deprivation – when we meet in @entity92 ’s @entity91 district			1
this is the area that was once christened the ‘ @entity97 ’ , such was the potency of the @entity7 threat			2
but wearing her greyish green ‘ multi-cam ’ fatigues , @entity1 effortlessly blends into her harsh surroundings			2
she says that spending so much time with the men in her unit has meant that their speech and behaviour has rubbed off on her			2
high - risk : private @entity110 , a medic , treats casualties on patrol and said : ' i would recommend the same career to any woman or man ' ‘ i ’ve ended up speaking like them and picking up their crude jokes , ’ she says , ‘ because we ’re all part of the same team , the guys and the girls			2
our job is to bring essential supplies to locations like this			2
we ’re here for anything from six to 36 hours at a time , delivering ammo , food , you name it			2
and i have been engaged by the enemy before , so i definitely know i ’m on the front line			2
’ back at @entity137 , the @entity138 hq in @entity92 , i saw scores of female soldiers maintaining their fitness with long runs and sprint sessions			2
they also carry more equipment than they used to on patrols			2
pint - sized private @entity110 , for example , routinely carries 90lb on her back on battlefield hikes			2
this feat is all the more remarkable as her burden equates to fully two - thirds of her bodyweight			2
but the bubbly , 5ft 1in medic is too modest to accept any praise for it			2
‘ it might sound like a lot to carry but i get trained to do that , it is my job , ’ she insists			2
‘ i go out on patrol with the guys as their medical support , with the same dangers			2
it is scary but i got used to it and learned more every day			2
treating my first casualty was nerve - racking but i do n’t think he cared if i was a woman or a man			0
’ like @entity1 , @entity110 is eager to emphasise that her gender is a secondary issue			0
so too is @entity110 ’s age			0
she is only 21 but is already a fully qualified @entity177 ( @entity178 ) – after leaving school with no qualifications for a medical career			0
blatant discrimination : the decision by the @entity43 to ban women transferring to any regiment in the infantry or armoured corps is under scrutiny following @entity59 's landmark step allowing women to fill all military roles @entity110 , from @entity192 , @entity193 , adds : ‘ first and foremost out here i am a medic , not a woman			1
we are all treated the same , male and female soldiers			0
‘ i know the public see it a bit differently , which is quite annoying , but we are equals			0
there are so many women on the front line doing very important jobs			1
i am just one of them and the guys treat me just the same			0
we ’re all a band of brothers			0
‘ do i think they ’d treat me differently if i got wounded – would they lose their concentration and focus ? i do n’t think so			0
‘ i am lucky to be surrounded by such talented guys			0
and i am here with them because when i left school none of the jobs available on civvy street were as exciting or challenging as the military			1
so i joined the @entity216			0
agreed : former secretary of state for defence , @entity217 endorsed a review that said women 's capability under fire was beyond doubt ‘ i would recommend the same career to any woman or man			1
yes , it is dangerous but i expect the danger now and deal with it on a daily basis			0
’ the @entity43 insists there remains no way of knowing if mixed - gender teams function as well as all - male teams in close - combat environments – a key argument used to justify the exclusion of women from combat units			1
its most recent review of the policy , published in 2010 , said women ’s capability under fire was beyond doubt but added that the situations they currently find themselves in were ‘ not typical of the small tactical teams which are required deliberately to close with and kill the enemy ’			1
with military chiefs opposed to the units being opened up to women , the then secretary of state for defence @entity217 , endorsed the review			1
his decision was legally watertight because in test cases – brought before the @entity138 courts and the @entity256 – gender inequality has been permitted when it has been intended to address a legitimate aim and was proportionate in the means of achieving that aim			0
the only glimpse of hope for female soldiers is that , under @entity265 law , the @entity138 must reassess such discriminations at least every eight years			0
however , not every female on the front line wants to beat the guys at their own game			0
twenty - four - year - old private @entity271 , originally from @entity272 , is only too happy to play a supporting role			0
speaking in the canteen at @entity275 , in @entity277 district , she said : ‘ some women in the @entity80 say you should push for equality – but i think it is impossible for most women to be as strong as men			1
i feel my role is in the kitchen and i ’d be more of a hindrance to the lads if i went out on the ground with them			0
i am happy looking after them in here			0
‘ that is not to say i do n’t have a frontline role , because i do			0
while i am a chef i also do guard duties two or three times a week , watching to see if the enemy approach the base			0
there ’s a rifle and a machine gun in the guard post and , if required to , i would engage			0
’ an @entity43 spokesman said there were no plans to review the policy			0
too risky : @entity306 president @entity305 has criticised civilian casualties caused by night raids launched by @entity310 troops missions against the @entity7 are being cancelled because it is considered too risky to go out in the rain or at night			0
the move follows criticism from @entity306 president @entity305 over civilian casualties caused by night raids launched by @entity310 ( @entity310 ) troops			0
but the latest restrictions on @entity138 operations have led to claims that , in the lead - up to the withdrawal of @entity138 troops next year , commanders are becoming too risk averse			0
former @entity80 commander @entity324 mp said : ‘ stopping operations when it is wet and dark must be deeply frustrating for professional soldiers			0
in war there is always a balance			0
we must not become risk - averse – otherwise the enemy will take full advantage			0
’ the restrictions caused by bad weather apply to what military personnel call ‘ deliberate operations ’ – those that are planned in advance and are not regarded as time - sensitive			1
military sources say the greatest concern surrounds the safety of the @entity346 ’s fleet of @entity348 and @entity349 helicopters			1
the pilots ’ ability to take off and land is compromised in bad weather			0
an @entity43 spokesman said : ‘ we are unable to provide further details due to operational security			0
