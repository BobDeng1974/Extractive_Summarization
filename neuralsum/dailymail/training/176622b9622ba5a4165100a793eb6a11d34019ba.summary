@entity0 found himself at the centre of a @entity3 storm on monday as @entity5 hero @entity4 and @entity7 boss @entity6 both registered their shock that he had been voted the outstanding player of the tournament			1
@entity0 seemed a little sheepish , perhaps embarrassed to be told after @entity12 had lost sunday ’s final to @entity13 in extra-time that he would be expected to trudge up the steps at the @entity16 to collect his @entity18 trophy from the presentation balcony			2
perhaps he was simply worn out , or perhaps he too felt there were more deserving candidates , such as any number of the triumphant @entity24 team , @entity26 ’s dashing winger @entity25 or @entity28 ’s six - goal playmaker @entity27 , who won the @entity29 for finishing as top scorer , and who got @entity4 ’s personal vote			1
‘ i would give heaven and earth to @entity58 but when marketing people want him to win something he did n’t ( deserve to ) win , it is unfair , ’ said @entity4 , who claimed the same award when @entity12 won the @entity3 in 1986			1
‘ i could see that he did n’t want to go up and collect it			0
’ by his own incredibly high standards @entity0 did not have the best of seasons in @entity67 , where his rhythm was hit by injuries but he started the @entity3 in @entity70 in great touch			2
there were wonderful solo goals against @entity74 and @entity75 in the group stage			0
he struck twice against @entity77 , including one of his trademark curling free - kicks , as @entity12 won @entity81 with a maximum nine points but he was unable to transfer this prolific form into the knock - out rounds			0
@entity85 " surprised " by @entity0 's @entity18 award scant consolation : @entity0 stood a winner in a losing team alongside @entity91 winner @entity90 did n't deserve it ! @entity4 says @entity0 's award was a marketing plan instead of a genuine prize dream is over : @entity0 looks to the ground after @entity13 win the @entity3 at the @entity16 without his moments of magic , @entity12 ’s goal - flow seized up			1
they scored only twice in four knock - out ties , even though three of the games went into extra-time			0
@entity0 seemed to fade , looked increasingly tired and was unable to find the net again			0
he was on target with his penalty in the shoot - out against the @entity110 after their semi-final in @entity112 had remained goalless through extra-time but his performance in the final against @entity13 was subdued and he missed one of the @entity12 ’s clearest chances			2
‘ i was a bit surprised when i saw @entity0 getting the best player of the tournament , ’ said @entity7 president @entity6			1
‘ if you compare the beginning of the tournament and why the team of @entity12 got to the final then look at the decisive goals he scored			0

@entity0 won the award for the @entity3 's most outstanding player
the decision was made via a vote by @entity7 ’s technical study group
@entity7 president @entity6 said he was shocked when @entity0 was named
@entity4 *believed* the choice was *motivated* by marketing
