@entity0 has pulled its @entity2 book titled i can be a @entity4 , after it triggered outrage over the ' sexist ' and ' patronizing ' message it sends to young girls			1
the $ 4 book , which was published by @entity10 and is aimed at three to seven - year - olds , was labeled ' misogynistic ' by parents for its plot line , which sees @entity2 - supposedly a computer engineer - make several technical blunders before turning to her male friends for help			1
@entity0 has apologized for the book in a post on the @entity20 , saying : ' the portrayal of @entity2 in this specific story does n’t reflect the @entity24 ’s vision for what @entity2 stands for			1
we believe girls should be empowered to understand that anything is possible and believe they live in a world without limits			0
sexist ? a @entity2 book entitled i can be a @entity4 ( pictured ) sees the famous blonde doll make a number of technical blunders before getting her male friends to fix them all ' we apologize that this book did n't reflect that belief			1
all @entity2 titles moving forward will be written to inspire girl 's imaginations and portray an empowered @entity2 character			1
' the book , written by author @entity45 and sold on @entity46 since 2013 , opens with @entity2 ' hard at work ' on her laptop , as she explains to her sister skipper : ' i 'm only creating the design ideas			1
i 'll need @entity53 's and @entity55 's help to turn it into a real game ! ' one irate reviewer wrote on @entity46 : ' literally six sentences into the story , and already @entity2 can not do it			2
' she immediately admits she does n't know how to actually do computer engineering , and like a @entity64 princess , needs a white knight to rescue her			0
' wheel in the men : @entity2 , while ' hard at work ' on her laptop , explains to her sister @entity70 ( pictured ) , ' i 'm only creating the design ideas			0
i 'll need @entity53 's and @entity55 's help to turn it into a real game ! ' the next scene sees @entity76 get hit with a ' weird ' virus on her laptop , before borrowing her sister 's computer to finish her work , only to inadvertently infect hers too			1
having lost all of @entity70 's ' unsaved ' homework and music files , @entity2 announces she is sorry , but she has to ' run off to school now			0
' skipper ' playfully hits @entity2 with a pillow , ' and @entity2 heads to school for a computer lesson from her glamorous female computer teacher			2
but alas , things do n't start looking up until she turns to her two male friends for help			2
pillow fight : the next scene sees @entity2 ( right ) get hit with a ' weird ' virus on her laptop , before borrowing @entity70 's ( left ) computer to finish her work , only to inadvertently infect hers too speed is of the essence : despite taking a computer lesson as school , things do n't start looking up until @entity2 enlists the help of two male friends ( pictured ) who can fix the issue ' faster ' ' it will go faster if @entity55 and i help , ' suggests @entity53 , before he and @entity108 fix the virus and retrieve all of @entity70 's files			1
@entity2 then heads home to ' surprise ' her sister with the good news			0
' you are just too cool @entity2 ! you fixed my computer and saved my homework ! ' @entity70 exclaims			2
reviewer @entity120 points out : ' @entity2 takes 100per cent of the credit for fixing something to which she contributed nothing			0
' she adds : ' i work as a software engineer , which is a male dominated field			0
' it is exactly these stereotypes and portrayals of girls like the one in this book that are the driving force behind the lack of girls wanting to enter these lucrative technology fields			0
' @entity53 saves the day : the book , written by author @entity45 , was published in june 2013 by @entity10 and is aimed at three to seven - year - olds sister act : in one of the final plot - twists , @entity2 seemingly takes all the credit for fixing @entity70 's laptop , despite @entity55 and @entity53 actually doing all the work another reviewer , also a computer engineer , writes : ' as the father of two daughters who are both in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics fields , my only recommendation for this book would be to set it on fire			1
' the only customer to defend the book , wrote : ' all you feminists in uproar over @entity2 asking for her male friends ' help in this book do n't even fit the profile for buying a @entity2 book			1
' it 's called free speech ! not every woman is just as competent as some men in certain areas and vice versa			0
' one female computer programmer by the name of @entity171 , based in @entity172 , @entity173 , set up a comical blog entitled @entity2 , which invites users to re-write pages from the book			2
alternate ending : one computer programmer by the name of @entity171 set up a blog entitled @entity2 , which invites users to re-write pages from the book and includes this submission ( pictured ) poking fun : another user puts their spin on the inflammatory children 's book ( pictured ) ' @entity2 's new book tells girls they need boys to code for them , ' the site 's description reads			2
' @entity195 be the competent , independent , bad - ass engineer that she wants to be			0
' submissions include @entity2 , rather that turning to her male friends for help , suggesting : ' it will go faster if you boys just get out of here and let me work			1
maybe make a @entity207 run ? ' in a statement made to @entity210 , a @entity2 representative said : ' this book was published in 2010			1
since that time we have reworked our @entity2 books			0
' the portrayal of @entity2 in this specific story does n’t reflect the brand ’s vision for what @entity2 stands for			0
we believe girls should be empowered to understand that anything is possible and believe they live in a world without limits			0
' we apologize that this book did n’t reflect that belief			0
all @entity2 titles moving forward will be written to inspire girls imaginations and portray an empowered @entity2 character			1

the $ 4 book aimed at three to seven - year - olds sees @entity2 as an *incompetent* ' computer engineer '
after a series of technical blunders , the doll gets her male friends to fix her *problems*
parents argue the plot plays into *damaging* gender stereotypes
in a statement made to @entity210 , @entity76 apologized and said ' all titles moving forward will be written to portray an empowered character '
