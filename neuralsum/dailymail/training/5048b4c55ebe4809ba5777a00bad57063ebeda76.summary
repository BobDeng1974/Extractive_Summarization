and while some have slipped into arrears , many more – accounting for loans of £ 41million – have refused to reveal where they live , whether they are working , or how much they are earning			0
if the debts are not repaid , @entity5 taxpayers will have to foot the bill – meaning foreign students are effectively receiving grants to study in the @entity5 while @entity27 students have to fork out a fortune for their higher education			1
