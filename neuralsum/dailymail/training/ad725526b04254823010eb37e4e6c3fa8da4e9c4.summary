his great - grandmother even wrote a letter to the court asking for leniency and hoping that her 24 - year - old great - grandson would not be jailed			1
but judge @entity26 told @entity2 : ' i can understand her views because to her you must be like a son			2
she stepped up to the mark to care for you when you needed it and has been caring for you but there are some situations which transcend the wishes of victims			0
' the courts have a duty to the public to mark the repugnance society feels at such conduct			0
this was a breach of a high degree of trust			0
it was a despicable course of conduct and it was exploitation not borne of desperation but borne out of sheer greed			0

@entity57 , prosecuting , said @entity2 , who was responsible for his great - grandmother 's financial affairs , stole the cash from an account she had with the @entity62 for 40 years			1
she loaned him her bank card and he was the only one who knew her pin number and used it at cash machines to withdraw money directly from the account or simply wrote out cheques payable to himself			2
his thieving came to light after his great - grandmother took out an equity release policy on her home with insurance company @entity74 and @entity2 attempted to obtain £ 30,000 in three tranches over four months in 2011			1
the company called in the police and the discrepancies were discovered			0

' until now he seems to have led a perfectly respectable life and cared for his great - grandmother all his life , ' said @entity99			1
he still lived with mrs @entity12 but no longer had access to her bank account			1
judge @entity26 told @entity2 he had used the account as a cash dispenser ' to dip into whenever you wanted			2
' in sentencing he had taken into account @entity2 's guilty plea , his previous good character and the views of his great - grandmother which helped reduce the sentence he handed down			1
a proceeds of crime hearing is expected to take place later in the year to reimburse mrs @entity12 for her losses .			0
