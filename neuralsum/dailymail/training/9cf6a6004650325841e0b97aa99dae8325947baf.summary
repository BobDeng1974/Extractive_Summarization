@entity0 from @entity1 , @entity2 , said she feels rejected by the store as it launches youth - oriented ad campaigns filled with celebrities and same - sex couples by @entity8 reporter published : 09:06 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 09:25 est , 11 june 2012 a longtime @entity10 customer is demanding that the store return to its ' frumpy ' roots			1
as the retail giant sets its sights on a younger demographic , @entity0 , a mother of three from @entity1 , @entity2 , has expressed disapproval over the store 's new range of clothing			1
ms @entity0 believes the store is working hard to ' de-frump ' itself without ' considering that many , if not most , of its customers might have shopped there precisely because they like the more conservative look			1
' disappointed : longtime @entity10 customers , such as @entity0 ( right ) , want the store to quit its attempts to ' de-frump ' its clothing range			1
she thinks its current stock is not suitable for daughter @entity32 ( left ) the 46 - year - old added that the clothes are not suitable for her 15 - year - old daughter @entity32 , due to new revealing hemlines			2
she believes the clothing , particularly dresses made for teenagers such as her daughter , has become more revealing over the past six months			0
she told @entity42 : ' having too much skin showing on a pretty teenage girl is too distracting , especially at church			0
[ @entity10 ] seemed to be better about providing enough fabric than other stores that the teenage girls tend to like to shop at			0
' she added : ' am i frumpy ? probably			0
does that bother me ? no , not at all			0
' ms @entity0 believed that the shift in target audience is thanks to the arrival of @entity56 , who was appointed chief executive officer last november			2
under the direction of mr @entity56 , the retailer has adopted new marketing strategies such as placing same - sex couples in multiple ad campaigns as well as supermodel @entity63 in another			1
new strategy : the store has recently aimed to attract younger shoppers through edgy fashion campaigns such as the above featuring supermodel @entity63 ( right ) , her mother ( middle ) and her daughter @entity71 ( left ) controversial : another recent campaign used a same - sex couple ( right ) to promote the store 's clothing contemporary design collaborations with the likes of @entity78 and @entity79 have further hinted that the store hopes to attract younger shoppers rather than older ones			1
the ultimate indicator came when it announced its forthcoming collaboration with @entity85 , which will include bags , jewellery , lingerie and accessories no doubt targeted at the teen market			0
ms @entity0 admitted that she avoids her local @entity10 store altogether these days			1
@entity92 , a regular @entity10 customer from @entity93 , does not welcome the store 's new attitude either			2
' they are catering to the younger shopper and it is n't the younger shopper that kept them afloat , ' she said			0
the store announced that it will introduce a ' @entity104 ' section in many of its locations later this year , that will feature almost 100 separate branded stores inside its own store in an attempt to create a marketplace feel			2
while the initiative will only be introduced at ' major metropolitan area ' stores , the move is a combative one against one of its main competitors @entity117 , which launched its similar shop at @entity117 concept last month .			0
