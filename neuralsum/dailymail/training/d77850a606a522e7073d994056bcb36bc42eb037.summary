@entity0 hailed friday night 's victory over @entity2 as the most important result of his three - year tenure as @entity6 coach			1
with a heavily depleted squad and huge psychological implications ahead of the @entity9 , @entity0 described the 21 - 16 upset at the @entity11 as the highest point since he took up his role in 2012			1
tries from @entity15 and @entity16 helped erase the haunting memories of two years ago , when @entity6 missed out on the @entity18 , and turned the @entity20 side into overnight favourites to win the championship			1
@entity6 head coach @entity0 has hailed his side 's 21 - 16 win against @entity2 in the @entity25 @entity6 centre @entity16 scored the decisive try of the game as they got the better of @entity2 on friday ' i remember getting interviewed two years ago and it was probably the lowest point of my coaching career , without a doubt , ' said @entity0			1
' this win is definitely up there as the highest point because of all the pressure and emotion leading into it			0
we had a lot of challenges in getting new combinations together and i 'm delighted to get the win			0
this cements our belief that we 're going in the right direction			0
' the match did not pass by without drama			0
both sides were involved in a tunnel stand - off before kick - off , with @entity6 skipper @entity51 refusing to lead out his side until @entity6 emerged from the dressing room			1

@entity6 's stars celebrate their brilliant win against @entity2 in the changing rooms the atmosphere at the @entity11 was electrifying both before and during the contest @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity51 were excellent			1
for @entity65 , i think it was his best performance during my time as @entity6 coach and i think @entity64 came of age			2
@entity6 were written off ahead of the match , having arrived in @entity70 with a double figure injury list including @entity72 and @entity73			1
that forced @entity0 to dip into his reserves of fringe players , with @entity65 and @entity16 among those making claims for a regular starting berth			0
