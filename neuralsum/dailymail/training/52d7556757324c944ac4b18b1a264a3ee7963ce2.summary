a primary school may ban a @entity2 teacher from visiting because parents fear he might spread @entity4 - even though his country has had no recorded cases of the killer disease			1
@entity8 , headteacher of @entity9 , has bowed to pressure and agreed it ' may be sensible ' to scrap the event next monday			0
parents are threatening to pull their children out of school because they said they were not getting ' total reassurance ' he will not bring @entity4 with him			1
row : parents at @entity9 in @entity18 , have raised concerns about a proposed visit from a @entity2 teacher amid fears of spreading @entity4 - despite there being no recorded cases in @entity2 @entity25 primary school , near @entity27 , @entity18 , is partnered with the @entity28 , a school in @entity2			1
in april teachers from the @entity31 school visited @entity2 to meet students and other teachers , but now the return visit has proved unpopular with some parents			1
this is despite @entity4 cases only coming from @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , which do n't even share a border with @entity2			1
one mother , who asked to remain anonymous , said : ' we have known about the trip for three or four weeks			0
we do n't want to cause any hysteria , we just want to voice our concerns , ' she said			0
' this is not a witch hunt by any means , the children love the visits and the visitors are always so lovely			0
' the letter we have got today addresses our concerns , but it does n't say that there is absolutely no chance of @entity4 coming over , and that 's what we want - total reassurance			1
' in his letter to parents yesterday mr @entity8 said flights to and from @entity2 remain unaffected by the virus and the visiting teacher poses no risk			2
but now it looks like he has changed his mind			0
he said : having listened very carefully to concerns reiterated by some parents this morning and in the interests of preserving our excellent relationship with them and the wider local community , i will be liaising with our governing body and the @entity74 today and we will make a decision following these discussions regarding the planned visit next week			0
' this was designed to be an enriching experience for both pupils here and our visitor from @entity2 and it is important for everyone that it is a success and focuses solely on the outcomes of our @entity88 project			0
' while the expert advice we have been given remains that @entity2 is not one of the countries identified as having the ebola virus and to date no cases of the virus have been recorded there , it may be that the sensible decision is to postpone this visit			1
' partnership : teachers from the @entity18 school were in @entity2 earlier this year to meet teachers and students , pictured , but the return visit has upset some parents it said : ' a number of parents have expressed their concern about the possible spread of the @entity4 infection into the @entity31 through the forthcoming visit of mr @entity111 , a visiting teacher from @entity28			1
' in school we take all concerns raised by parents and the school community with the utmost seriousness and pupil / staff health and safety is our absolute primary concern			0
' the health and wellbeing of our pupils is the most important thing to us so we have gone to considerable lengths to make sure we have expert advice regarding next week 's visit from a number of regional and national authorities , including @entity129 , the @entity130 , @entity131 and the @entity74			0
' given these facts and , following consultation with members of the school governing body , at this present time the visit planned for next week will go ahead			0
' however , the situation will be monitored closely over the coming days and should any changes to this position become apparent , then immediate action will be taken			0
' screening of airline passengers from @entity40 , @entity38 and @entity39 has started at @entity144 and will be rolled out at @entity146 and @entity147 terminals			2
but there are calls for it to be extended to @entity151			2
the @entity153 mp for @entity154 , @entity155 , said that despite it being a ' complicated ' disease to detect , the port should be included in the @entity31 's screening process			2
a @entity159 said , however , there was no immediate plans to screen for @entity4 at @entity31 's main passenge port			1
mr @entity155 said : ' i think if we are going to do checks at airports and on @entity147 it would make sense to do it in @entity154 '			2
there have also been cases in @entity171 , the @entity172 and @entity173 , but only from people who travelled back from @entity175 or treated them in hospital			2
the government has warned that @entity31 should expect up to ten cases of @entity4 by @entity180 .			1
