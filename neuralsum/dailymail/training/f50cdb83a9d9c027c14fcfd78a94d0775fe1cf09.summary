by @entity0 published : 13:13 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 14:02 est , 5 september 2012 he has been criticised for being too distant and too cold			1
but now @entity2 has revealed that he is just being honest with people - because that ’s the way he really is			1
the president said that he refused to fake emotions as he wanted to be ‘ authentic ’ with the @entity8 people			1
i am who i am : president @entity2 , pictured in august , revealed he refuses to fake emotions as he wanted to be ' authentic ' with the @entity8 people routine : he always wears the same thing every day - blue or grey suits - to save brain power for other matters if people think he is too detached then ... that ’s because he is too detached , he admitted			1
in an interview mr @entity2 also claimed he is so focused his job that he has delegated even the most basic tasks - like deciding what he eats			1
he always wears the same thing every day - blue or grey suits - to save brain power , like @entity25 ’s character @entity26 in the 1986 sci - fi horror @entity26			1
since the president took office , commentators have repeatedly criticised him for his inability to connect with voters and claimed he is too cerebral			1
he has been compared unfavourably to former presidents @entity33 and @entity34 who most people would feel more comfortable going for a beer with			1
authentic : the president said ' i 'm absolutely positive that i 'm serving the @entity8 people better if i 'm maintaining my authenticity ' speaking to @entity42 magazine , however , mr @entity2 said he would be lying to himself and everyone else if he tried to be too emotional			1
he said : ‘ i feel it is an insult to the people i ’m dealing with			2
for me to feign outrage , for example , feels to me like i ’m not taking the @entity8 people seriously			1
' i 'm absolutely positive that i 'm serving the @entity8 people better if i 'm maintaining my authenticity			2
i 'm at my best when i believe what i am saying			2
' ‘ i ’m absolutely positive that i ’m serving the @entity8 people better if i ’m maintaining my authenticity			2
‘ and that ’s an overused word			2
and these days people practice being authentic			1
but i ’m at my best when i believe what i am saying			2
’ mr @entity2 , who is known for his love of basketball and golf , said that he has to exercise ‘ or at some point you ’ll just break down ’			2
he said that day - to - day he has to ‘ routinize ’ himself so as not to waste brain power on the little things so keeps lists of things he needs to get done			2
he said : ‘ i ’m trying to pare down decisions			0
i do n’t want to make decisions about what i ’m eating or wearing			0
unwinding : mr @entity2 , pictured playing with family dog @entity65 on the @entity68 lawn in 2009 , said he needs to unwind by exercising ‘ because i have too many other decisions to make			0
you need to focus your decision - making energy			0
‘ you ca n’t be going through the day distracted by trivia ’			0
the @entity74 ’ first night in the @entity68 was bizarre , he added , and that it took him a week to get his head around it			1
me and @entity2 : the entire interview appears in the latest issue of @entity42 mr @entity2 said : ‘ the first night you sleep in the @entity68 , you ’re thinking , all right			1
i ’m in the @entity68			0
and i ’m sleeping here			0
‘ there ’s a time in the middle of the night when you just kind of startle awake			0
there ’s a little bit of a sense of absurdity			0
‘ there is such an element of randomness in who gets this job			0
what am i here for ? why am i walking around the @entity94 ? that does n’t last long			0
’ being president comes with a high price , and mr @entity2 misses being able to ‘ wander around ’ without an entourage of @entity100 bodyguards			1
he and wife @entity101 love to sit out on the balcony as it is the closest they come to being normal people			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s much harder to be surprised			0
you do n’t have those moments of serendipity			0
you do n’t bump into a friend in a restaurant you have n’t seen in years			0
‘ the loss of anonymity and the loss of surprise is an unnatural state			0
you adapt to it , but you do n’t get used to it - at least i do n’t			0
’ another bizarre side - effect of being president is that he has got used to ‘ a character people see out there called @entity2 ’ that is n’t him			1
mr @entity2 said that the strange duality forced him to filter some things out , but not so much that he ended up living in a ‘ fantasy land ’ .			1
