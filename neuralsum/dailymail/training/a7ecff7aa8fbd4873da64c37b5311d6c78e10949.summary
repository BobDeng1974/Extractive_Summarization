by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:18 est , 10 february 2014 shock : @entity4 was given a parking fine despite driving to the @entity6 with severe pain and bleeding while pregnant with baby @entity8 a pregnant woman who drove herself to @entity6 when she though she was losing the second of her twin babies has been fined for parking at the hospital without a ticket			1
@entity4 , 33 , rushed to @entity15 in @entity16 at 5am on october 18 with severe pain and bleeding after falling over at home while 38 weeks pregnant			1
despite suffering the same symptoms that had already claimed the life of one of her twin babies 24 weeks earlier , mrs @entity4 , from @entity24 in @entity25 , was given a parking ticket and threatened with court action if she did not pay out			1
upon arriving at the hospital by herself at 5am , mrs @entity4 was helped from her car and into @entity6 by an elderly couple			1
she left her vehicle in a space at the flagship hospital ’s car park , but there was no time for her to purchase a ticket from a pay - and - display machine			1
mrs @entity4 had been struck down by hyperemesis gravidarum , which causes nausea and vomiting , and which had already claimed the life of one of her twins at just 14 weeks			1
it was the same devastating condition suffered by the @entity46 , who was taken into hospital at the beginning of her pregnancy with @entity50			0
mrs @entity4 , who lost a stone - and - a - half as she battled the illness , later gave birth to a healthy baby girl , @entity8			2
but she was shocked to receive a £ 75 parking fine several weeks after her terrifying visit to @entity6			1
mrs @entity4 appealed to @entity57 , which runs the hospital ’s parking payments system , on january 23 of this year			2
but the company initially refused to waive the fine and even threatened to take legal action against her if she did not make the payment			2
emergency : upon arriving at the hospital by herself at 5am , mrs @entity4 left her vehicle in a space in the hospital 's car park ( pictured ) , but there was no time to purchase a pay - and - display ticket mrs @entity4 said : ' it ’s absolutely disgusting - my child ’s life was at risk and they still want to fine me			1
' ' my baby could have died ... i had already lost her sibling ' , she added			0
she went on to say : ' it would have been different if it was an appointment but this was an emergency			0
' a spokesman @entity57 claims the company has since cancelled the parking ticket after local newspaper @entity86 intervened on her behalf			1
the practice of charging hospital patients for car parking has long been controversial			2
branded a ' tax on the sick ' by campaigners , many hospitals rake in millions of pounds in profit every year , with a study by the @entity97 last year finding some @entity99 organisations charge almost three times the national average for non-hospital parking spaces			0
some of the worst affected by parking charges are people who have to visit hospitals regularly , including cancer patients , those with sick children and people visiting relatives in intensive care			0
although it is down to each individual hospital to set its own charges , the @entity99 explicitly advises them to offer ' fair and appropriate concessions ' for patients forced to pay disproportionate sums			0
however some hospitals , including the @entity118 , the @entity119 and @entity120 and the @entity121 are still charging patients a base rate of £ 3 - an - hour to park , rising much higher when the stay is for several hours or days			0
according to its website , @entity15 in @entity16 , where @entity125 had treatment , charges patients £ 1.20 an hour , rising to £ 18 to stay in its multi-storey car park for 12 hours			0
disabled blue badge holders are allowed to park for free outside the main entrance when displaying their permit , but they too must pay to park in the multi-storey car park			0
there are , however , concessions for people visiting the hospital if they are visiting a relative who is expected to die , next - of - kins or birthing partners visiting a labour ward , or inpatients facing treatment for either less than seven days , or for between 14 and 21 days			0
cancer patients visiting the hospital regularly for treatment have to pay for parking , but they may be reimbersed at a later date at the discretion of a matron or senior sister .			2
