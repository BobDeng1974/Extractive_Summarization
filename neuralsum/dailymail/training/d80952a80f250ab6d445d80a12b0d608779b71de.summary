in a turbulent 24 hours , the @entity0 is right back where it started , after it appeared to lose a chief minister , gain a new one , and then eventually reinstated the first one			1
and despite expressing a desire to avoid the fate of the @entity7 in @entity8 , the damage wrought may well consign the @entity10 to a one - term government when the public go to the polls in august next year			0
at 1am on tuesday , minister for primary industry and mines @entity15 called a hasty news conference to announce that he had been voted chief minister by his parliamentary wing colleagues			1
mr @entity15 said mr @entity21 had ' 110 per cent ' of his support , and that he was very pleased to be deputy the trigger was discontent with the direction the government was taking , he said , promising to be more consultative and transparent			1
but just 18 hours later he stood calmly beside the man he 'd tried to topple and pledged him his full support , dismissing the incident as " nothing more than a fairly large blip on the radar "			0
' i am 100 per cent , in fact 110 per cent behind the chief minister , ' mr @entity15 told reporters			1
earlier in the day chief minister @entity21 refused to resign just minutes before mr @entity15 's planned swearing - in ceremony at 11am , grinding the leadership change to a halt			1
as it turned out , the challengers only had the support of nine of the 25 members of the @entity46 , but needed 13 to agree to install a new chief minister			2
on tuesday afternoon mr @entity21 whittled away their numbers , calling his colleagues ' bluff , and pointing out that they could n't expect to govern if they could n't mount a proper coup			2
mr @entity21 accepted that mistakes he 'd made as leader contributed to the uproar , but was vague on how he would work to his colleagues ' satisfaction in future			2
' i think you need to be a bit more inclusive in how you do things ... making sure it 's not just cabinet deciding things , but also the wider parliamentary wing , ' he said			0
mr @entity21 stepped away from suggestions he made earlier in the day that he would consider resigning and calling for an early election , and denied he had threatened his colleagues with a snap poll to retain power			0
' i was thinking about an early election to tidy a few things up , but we 've resolved our differences ... @entity15 has been a bloody good minister the whole time in government			0
' this was a marked difference from his critique of mr @entity15 earlier in the day , when he said he could have better handled outbreaks of banana freckle and a melon virus			0
' quite frankly , i do n't believe that @entity15 has the capacity , capability or the tenacity or the professionalism to be chief minister , ' he said			2
meanwhile mr @entity15 said mr @entity21 had ' 110 per cent ' of his support , and that he was very pleased to be deputy			1
it 's his second time in the job , after a six - day stint in 2013 the week before mr @entity21 mounted his own successful coup against then - leader @entity92 , who was in @entity93 on trade talks			1
he said he could absolutely rule out staging another coup to get the chief minister 's attention in future			0
mr @entity21 said attorney - general @entity99 , whom mr @entity15 had named as his deputy , would keep his job , but did not rule out other sackings			1
the reshuffled cabinet is expected to be sworn in at a later date .			0

@entity15 announced at 1am on tuesday he had been voted in an the @entity0 's new chief minister
chief minister @entity21 refused to resign ahead of mr @entity15 's planned swearing - in ceremony
mr @entity15 did not have required support to install himself as the new chief minister
he has since said he is very pleased to be the new deputy to mr @entity21
