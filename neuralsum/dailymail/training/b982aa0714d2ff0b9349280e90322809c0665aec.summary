by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:16 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 05:55 est , 17 november 2012 @entity2 : sir @entity4 and @entity5 shortly before he made reference to ' recent news ' while taking about sexual abuse children in @entity2 presenter sir @entity4 failed to mention @entity10 on tonight 's show as he made reference to the ' awful reminder ' the disgraced presenter 's scandal has had on the abuse of youngsters			1
following a performance from @entity19 sir @entity4 talked about the ' news in recent weeks ' before leading into a film about victims of different forms abuse			1
he said : ' we know that children are vulnerable and news in recent weeks has been an awful reminder of how terrible that can be			1
' here at @entity2 we have been supporting children suffering all kinds of abuse , including sexual abuse			1
we hope you can help us to continue that support			2
' it had been anticipated that the @entity35 would use this year 's @entity2 to address the @entity36 - and it will come as no surprise that the disgraced presenter was not mentioned by name			2
@entity35 executives will be keeping a close eye on the public response to its flagship annual charity fundraising programme as it continues to air throughout the night			2
the appeal is likely to be seen as a test of support for the corporation in light of the successive scandals that have rocked it over the past six weeks			0
sir @entity4 is once again presenting the show , which last year raised a record £ 46million			1
the @entity55 revelations and the fallout from the shelved @entity58 report about the late @entity59 'll fix it star will inevitably cast a shadow over this year 's six - hour fundraiser on @entity64 and @entity65			1
prior to its airing @entity35 sources told @entity105 the programme would make reference to ' recent events that have been covered in the press ' but that it was not expected to specifically mention @entity10			1
' there will be some kind of reference to recent events that have been covered in the @entity113 quite extensively , ' said a @entity35 insider			1
' it will also say that @entity2 does and always has supported children who were the victims of abuse and will continue to support the amazing work that these charities do			2
scandal : @entity10 appeared on the telethon in 1984 , 1987 and 1989 last year the charity fundraising event chalked up a record £ 46million @entity4 ( left ) was joined by @entity35 presenters @entity5 , @entity82 ( right ) and new radio 1 breakfast dj @entity124 for tonight 's show ' there will be a film to reflect that , and there was one on the same subject last year			1
' sir @entity132 , the former chairman of @entity2 , revealed last month that @entity10 was secretly banned from the @entity2 appeal for being ‘ creepy ’			2
though still revered elsewhere at the corporation , the presenter was kept away from the annual fundraiser because of ' rumours ' of his interest in young girls			0
@entity10 appeared on the telethon in 1984 , 1987 and 1989 , before sir @entity132 became chairman			2
a member of the board of governors between 1996 and 2002 , sir @entity132 said he would have stepped down from his charity role if @entity10 had become involved			2
the @entity35 has also suffered a slump in trust among licence - fee payers as a result of the @entity55 scandal and the ensuing crisis over an inaccurate @entity58 report about an alleged child abuser , which led to the resignation of director general @entity155 on saturday			1
the former judge who is leading a @entity35 inquiry into the @entity10 sexual abuse scandal has launched an appeal for witnesses			1
dame @entity161 , who is reviewing the corporation 's practices during the @entity164 years , has called on potential victims , witnesses , people who worked with the tv presenter and senior staff at the time to assist with the investigation			0
according to the inquiry 's website , the review also wants to hear from people ' who were familiar with the culture or practices of the @entity35 ' in terms of ' preventing or enabling the sexual abuse of children , young people or teenagers '			1
@entity10 became hugely famous during the 1960s and 1970s as a @entity183 1 dj and presenter of @entity59 'll fix it on @entity64			0
he worked for the @entity35 between 1964 and approximately 2007 , according to the review 's website			0
but @entity10 , who died last year at the age of 84 , is now believed to have been one of the @entity191 's most prolific abusers , with hundreds of possible victims			0
a @entity194 poll published on tuesday found that for the first time since it began tracking support for @entity199 institutions in 2003 , more respondents distrust @entity35 journalists ( 47 per cent ) than trust them ( 44 per cent )			0
@entity194 reported a slump of 13 percentage points in trust in @entity35 journalism the past fortnight – suggesting the corporation 's reputation has been harmed more by the inaccurate @entity58 report and @entity155 's resignation than by earlier revelations about @entity10			0
@entity35 insiders said @entity10 would be the ' elephant in the room ' during this year 's appeal , but people working on the show stressed that it would be ' business as usual to make the very best programme we can make so the viewers really enjoy it '			0
a former chairman of @entity2 , sir @entity132 , said last month that the charity had made a decision to keep @entity10 away from the event because he had suspicions about the @entity226 presenter			1
@entity132 , a former @entity35 governor for @entity227 , said he always felt @entity10 was a ' pretty creepy sort of character … we took the decision that we did n't want him anywhere near the charity and we just stepped up our child protection policies , which again would have put him at risk if he tried anything '			0
@entity4 has been joined by @entity35 presenters @entity5 , @entity82 and new radio 1 breakfast dj @entity124			2
this year 's appeal will be executive produced by @entity238			0
a @entity35 spokesman said : ' our aim this year , like every year , is to raise as much money as possible and we are on track to raise millions to help change lives of disadvantaged children across the @entity191			0
' @entity2 has a strong track record of funding projects with a specific focus on supporting children and young people who are at risk of , or have experienced , some form of sexual abuse			1
' on friday night , the show will feature a number of films based on the work we fund to help disadvantaged children and young people in the @entity191 , this will include some of our work helping the victims of sexual abuse , as was the case last year			1
' last year 's @entity2 , featuring bandaged mascot @entity264 , raised £ 46million , taking to more than £ 650million the amount of money it has generated since its first broadcast in 1980			0
@entity88 have recorded this year 's @entity2 single , @entity269			0
friday night 's programme will also feature special editions of @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 , and @entity93 the dog , winner of @entity279 's @entity199 's @entity278 , meeting his @entity2 namesake			0
