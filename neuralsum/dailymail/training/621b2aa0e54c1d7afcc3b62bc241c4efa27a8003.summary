professor @entity0 , pictured , has warned that the history of @entity2 is being taught in ' a distorted way ' in order to promote the @entity5 the history of @entity2 is being taught to pupils in a ‘ distorted ’ way in order to promote the @entity5 , a leading @entity9 historian has claimed			1
professor @entity0 , of @entity11 , said the ‘ soft push ’ for further @entity14 integration that had been seen in @entity16 and @entity17 education was beginning to ‘ creep in ’ to @entity9 classrooms			1
he joins television historian @entity19 and professors @entity20 and @entity22 in launching a campaign , @entity24 for @entity9 , calling for a fundamental redrawing of the @entity9 ’s relationship with @entity2			0
in total 30 academics have backed the campaign and contributed essays to criticise the concept of a single @entity14 identity that underpins the emphasis on further integration			1
in his essay professor @entity0 wrote : ‘ the search for common roots has not been ignored in @entity37 and among its acolytes			0
school textbooks are issued that attempt to present the history of @entity2 as a common enterprise			0
‘ it hardly needs to be said that this has involved a distortion of the past , by assuming that a sense of @entity14 identity has existed for centuries , and by assuming a common purpose leading to the ultimate unification of @entity2			1
’ millions of children across the continent could be being taught a skewed version of history for political purposes , professor @entity0 feared			1
‘ there is a soft push to create a sense of @entity14 citizenship which is based on frankly an invented common history , because the history of @entity2 is to a large extent the history of division , not the history of unity , ’ he said			1
‘ when it has been the history of unity , as we ’ve seen under @entity67 and @entity68 or under the @entity69 in @entity2 , it has gone disastrously wrong			0
it is a papering over the discordant elements in @entity14 history to create this idealised event			0
’ the @entity11 academic said the @entity5 had been presented as a ‘ great train ’ with the tracks leading to a ‘ @entity76 ’ in some textbooks			0
he raised concerns that children were being misled into believing that ‘ @entity14 citizenship trumps national allegiance ’ and suggests the notion that it is ‘ obvious and natural ’ to have a fully integrated @entity14 state			0
tv historian @entity19 , pictured , has also joined a movement opposing further @entity5 integration he added : ‘ attempts to create an artificial notion of ‘ @entity2 ’ distract from the reality of the situation and make it harder to rectify the many problems that exist within the @entity5 ’s institutions			2
’ his concerns are shared by other historians , one of whom compared the push for @entity14 unity to the tyranny of @entity99 , and another who warned that it undermined principles defended by sir @entity103			2
@entity104 , chief executive of @entity105 , the campaign backing renegotiation which is affiliated with historians for @entity9 , said the idea of a single @entity14 identity was ‘ dangerous ’			1
he told the @entity111 newspaper : ‘ the @entity5 ’s official motto is ‘ @entity118 in diversity ’ , a laudable philosophy			0
unfortunately , many of the @entity5 ’s policies seem intent on crushing that diversity , striving to replace @entity2 ’s many historic identities with a single , artificial ‘ @entity14 ’ culture			2
