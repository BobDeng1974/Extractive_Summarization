' at best they maybe could offer him a flat rate or one - time settlement to buy out his portion of the group , but otherwise we may never get a @entity1 reunion because none of them want him to benefit financially , ' the source concluded			1
@entity1 made their debut in 1998 with their self - titled release			0
the group then consisted of @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
