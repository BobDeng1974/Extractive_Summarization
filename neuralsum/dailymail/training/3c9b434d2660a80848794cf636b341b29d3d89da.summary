now that september is in full swing , i thought it was about time for a serious skincare shuffle			1
although i do stay loyal to certain skincare products , being the beauty junkie i am means it ’s difficult not to be tempted by the plethora of new releases			1
it 's particularly suited to those whose skin is just starting to show the first signs of ageing , as it contains anti-oxidant rich olive oil and firming olive leaf extract to combat fine lines and uneven skin texture			1
as @entity39 always reminds me , the key to youthful looking skin in your older years is to start early – prevention is better than cure ! @entity42 this weekly mask transforms dreary , tired - looking skin in an instant ( well , 10 minutes ! )			2
made up of a combination of nutritious fruit acids , the powerful formula removes dead skin cells , reduces blemishes and smooths the skin 's surface , leaving you with a significantly brighter , more radiant complexion			2
the zesty citrus scent and slight tingling effect on the skin make the mask a real pleasure to use , too			2
@entity59 @entity60 i 've had a few late nights with filming recently , and so have been reaching for this super-effective dark circle corrector to brighten and soothe my tired peepers			0
@entity60 blends a high concentration of caffeine with light - reflecting pigments to banish dark circles and illuminate the eye area , and its gentle texture makes it suitable for the delicate under eye region , providing an instant cooling effect once applied			0
perfect timing : @entity18 says autumn is a great opportunity to refresh your skin after the dry summer months @entity77 after seeing lots of fellow bloggers rave about this micellar cleanser , i thought i 'd try it out			1
similarly to my favourite @entity84 , this @entity83 fluid feels ultra-light on the skin without leaving an oily residue			2
as it 's made up of purely natural ingredients , it 's perfect for easily irritated skin and removes mascara like a dream when applied with a cotton pad			1
plus it 's a toner as well as a cleanser and make - up remover – 3 skincare steps in one product makes it a definite winner in my eyes			2
skinbreeze @entity101 let 's face it , we all suffer from bad skin days , whether it 's redness and blemishes or a spot that just wo n't budge			0
i always rely on the fast - acting @entity109 to stop spots in their tracks – it contains salicylic and hyaluronic acids to quickly tackle breakouts , blemishes and redness			0
as well as this , it 's infused with seaweed extract to leave skin feeling soothed and nourished			0
all of @entity18 's top picks are available at available at @entity121 now			1
new style : in addition to rebooting her skincare routine @entity18 tries out @entity126 waves this week @entity18 's how to : @entity126 waves i also thought i 'd show you a quick hair tutorial this week – my friend @entity131 helped me create this gorgeous sleek wavy do for a night out recently			1
i 've been loving rocking this glamorous @entity126 - style look both day and night as an alternative to my usual more messy boho style			1
here ’s how to do it : after applying a heat protection product such as @entity138 and @entity139 / @entity140 , brush your hair throroughly to untangle any knots and ensure a smooth , sleek curl			0
clip the majority of your hair up to the top of your head , leaving roughly an inch of hair around the whole head at the bottom to start with			0
using a medium - sized pair of tongs like @entity154 , take a small section of hair and lightly wrap it around the tong , holding in place for a few seconds			0
ensure the hair is wrapped flat around the tongs for a smooth finish			0
voila ! @entity18 recommends using a heat treatment spray to keep curls looking sleek for a @entity126 - style sleek , glamorous look , curl each section of hair in the same direction and keep the sections of hair being curled of equal size			1
repeat the process across your whole head of hair by taking down further sections until you reach the top			0
when you reach the crown , use the tongs to curl the last sections of hair in the opposite direction to the rest of the curls to give the style some body and avoid looking like a poodle ! once you ’ve curled all of your hair , give the finished look some serious volume by backcombing the top half of your hair , working a comb gently upwards to create body near the crown			0
do n’t worry if your hair starts looking a bit crazy , as it can easily be smoothed out ! finally , use a bristly brush to sleek out your backcombed barnet , and hold the style in place with a long - lasting hairspray such as @entity199			0
et voila ! a sleek @entity126 - style barnet without having to set foot into the salon			1
stay gorgeous , @entity18 xxx			1
