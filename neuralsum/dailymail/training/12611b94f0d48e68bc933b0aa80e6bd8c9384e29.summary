appearing in a @entity1 quarter - final ? winning the @entity2 ? pocketing a £ 10,000 bonus ? well , they ’re all very nice but nothing compared to a goal against @entity7 at the @entity8 , as far as @entity9 is concerned			1
@entity9 has never been the archetypal modern footballer			1
turned off by the fame and fortune at @entity12 , he has discovered far more joy in briefly representing his beloved @entity14 at the end of his career and helping them back into the @entity17			1
@entity9 will line up for @entity14 against former club @entity12 in the @entity18 @entity9 has helped his beloved @entity20 back into the @entity17 and is rewarded with this tie @entity9 celebrates with @entity22 and @entity23 during a 2001 @entity1 tie with @entity25 @entity9 celebrates one of his two goals for @entity12 - at @entity28 in january 2001 ‘ it felt more emotional than anything i did at @entity12 , ’ said the 34 - year - old as he recalled scoring his first for @entity20 , last year			1
‘ i ’ve never felt like that on the field before			2
coming here for all those years and watching them , and seeing that @entity8 ... so to score there was special			2
’ @entity9 ’s passion for his home - town club refused to fade during a career which took him from @entity41 to @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
@entity48 would buy him the new @entity14 shirt each @entity50 and once , during his spell of more than 200 games for @entity53 , she decorated one of the rooms in their house with a black - and - amber design featuring the club badge			1
‘ i really did n’t want that to come out , ’ he laughed			2
‘ it makes me look a bit strange			2
‘ she did a similar thing when my son was born , with a @entity66 mural on one of the walls in his bedroom , and it was incredible			2
‘ i said : “ you could do a @entity20 one ” , just mucking about			2
10 years after leaving @entity41 , @entity9 again found himself centre of attention this week a sketch of @entity9 in @entity14 colours drawn by club director @entity77 @entity9 ( right ) helps move a goal during @entity14 training this week ' i went away at pre-season , came back and there it was			1
the wall was painted yellow and black and the badge was in the middle			2
it was really good , a nice thing to do			2
’ @entity9 ’s affections run deep for a team he first watched in the @entity90 before they climbed from the fourth tier to fifth place in the second in 1992 , losing in the play - offs and missing promotion to the inaugural @entity2			1
‘ the original team i came to see was people like @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , ’ he said			2
‘ the club really started taking off with @entity102 in charge and @entity104 , with @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
‘ i could name one to 11			0
we went to @entity111 when big @entity105 scored the winner			0
that was a great occasion			0
‘ my favourite was @entity115			0
my dad got me a framed picture of him , signed , and he came to do my club team ’s presentation			1
' i ca n’t find the picture now and it is one thing i ’m always looking for			0
my mum must ’ve thrown it out			0
i ’d love to get it back			0
’ chadwick in action for his home town team @entity20 in their @entity18 third round tie against @entity129 @entity9 joined @entity44 in 2004 and is pictured with former @entity12 star @entity130 he spent a season on loan with @entity43 in @entity133 during 2002 - 03 before joining @entity20 , @entity9 spent six seasons with @entity53 despite his devotion , @entity20 showed no interest in signing young @entity9			1
he went to trials at @entity138 but they did n’t ask him back			0
so he went to @entity140 where he played with @entity141 before @entity12 spotted him playing for @entity142 and a bit of @entity145 charm tempted him north			1
‘ we ’d played @entity147 and my old man brought me back , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ my mum let us in the house and she said : “ i ’ve just had a call from @entity145			0
' she thought it was someone mucking about			0
i felt like a million dollars			0
he knew every player by name from the @entity158 to the first team			0
he was just an incredible man			0
’ @entity9 overcame homesickness and progressed to the fringes of an illustrious first - team			1
@entity22 was ‘ a fantastic man ’ , he said , @entity163 was ‘ a really good guy ’ , the @entity164 were ‘ enthusiastic ’ , @entity165 was ‘ something special ’ but @entity167 was the best player			0
a comparison of the costs between the @entity14 and @entity12 line - ups @entity171 knows his @entity12 team will have to be on top of their game to avoid a @entity18 shock ‘ @entity167 could do everything , ’ he said			1
‘ his vision , awareness and ability to play the right pass every time was incredible			1
the man was a genius			0
‘ i really enjoyed my time there			0
i just do n’t think i really wanted it as much as you should			0
i was n’t sure i was 100 per cent happy living in @entity188			0
i was always happier living at home			0
’ he once picked up a £ 10,000 bonus from a brief appearance as a substitute against @entity194 in a @entity1 quarter - final			1
‘ you ’re getting paid a lot of money to play football , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t know if i wanted that life			0
i just want to play football			2
i do n’t want to be famous			0
it ’s a great thing to do but happiness is more important , to be comfortable , living a life i want			0
’ @entity9 ’s move from @entity53 to @entity20 last year completed his circle , adding great personal satisfaction to a long career			1
the @entity209 has been @entity20 's home since 1932 but has witnessed few occasions like this the ground will be full to its 8,000 - capacity for the visit of @entity12 on friday night a view of the shower room in the away team dressing room at the @entity209 fans have already been snapping up half - and - half scarves ahead of the match his sons @entity224 ( 11 ) and @entity225 ( nine ) , both play at the club ’s academy and on friday night his past and present collide at the @entity209 in the @entity18 fourth round			1
his fondest @entity12 memory was a goal against @entity28 in 2001 , after he was released by a pass from @entity163 , and he still has his @entity2 winner ’s medal in a drawer with the medal from last year ’s conference play - off final , when @entity20 beat @entity240			1
‘ it was a massive thing to get back into the @entity17 , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ i do n’t really cry but when we won at @entity111 , i could n't stop			2
why am i crying ? i ’m not an emotional person			0
