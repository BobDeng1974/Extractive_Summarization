by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 11:43 est , 21 january 2013 four @entity1 who spent a terrifying day trapped up a tree hiding from a crocodile finally rescued yesterday - luckily with only bites from mosquitoes and sand flies			1
the construction workers had been crab fishing in @entity9 when their small tin boat overturned while they were in the country ’s remote @entity11			1
they were unable to turn it upright so they swam towards a thick clump of mangrove trees , which grow out of the swampy water			2
but , unfortunately for the four , who are all aged in their 30s , there was a huge crocodile in the same area			0
in trouble : the construction workers had been crab fishing in @entity9 when their small tin boat overturned while they were in a swamp in the country 's remote @entity11 in fear and desperation , they swam towards mangroves and clambered up on the highest trees they could find			1
the four were forced to shelter there for 22 hours while they waited to be rescued , spending a sleepless night hanging on to the branches			1
‘ it was a horrible experience , ’ one of the men , covered in thick black swamp mud , told his rescuers			0
‘ it scared the s * * * out of us			0
’ crocodile experts in @entity44 said if the men had been able to shine a torch into the dark water beneath them there is little doubt they would have seen the reflected red eyes of a number of crocodiles waiting for them to make the mistake of getting back into the water			1
the mangrove swamps of the @entity11 are alive with man - eating saltwater crocodiles - ‘ salties ’ , as they are known - and there have been numerous deaths , despite warnings for people to stay out of the water			1
big beast : salt - water crocodile similar to the one that sent the men clambering up a tree having seen a large crocodile themselves , there was no chance of the men getting out of their tree during the night			1
they told their rescuers that despite their discomfort they agreed they were going to cling to the branches throughout the night			2
only when the tide dropped yesterday morning did the men agree to take a chance and swim the short distance back to their boat			1
they were able to swim under the upturned vessel and retrieve a distress beacon			2
when the @entity83 received the signal , a police launch and a helicopter were despatched to pick up the men			0
scary : the incident occurred in @entity88 , known for its large population of salt - water crocodiles the helicopter reached them first and winched them out of the water and flew them back to @entity44			2
their arms and legs were covered in sandfly and mosquito bites and they were suffering from dehydration and lack of sleep			0
they were also covered in thick black mud			0
police experts agreed that if the men had not been able to summon help with their beacon it is doubtful they would have survived their ordeal			0
their strength , whether they were still in a tree or clinging to their upturned boat , would have soon drained – and crocodiles would have moved in for the kill			1
‘ we ’ve vowed not to go fishing for a while , ’ said one of the men			0
‘ but we still have to go back out there to help recover the little boat which we had borrowed			0
‘ this time we ’ll make sure we do n’t tip over			0

they were crab fishing in @entity44 , @entity11 , when boat *capsized*
the men could *n't* overturn boat so swam to trees as crocodile *approached*
they stayed all night , clinging to branches as crocodiles waited below
finally rescued after tide went out to retrieve beacon in upturned boat
