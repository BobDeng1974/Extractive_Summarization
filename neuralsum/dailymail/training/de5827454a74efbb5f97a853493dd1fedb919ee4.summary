' @entity37 and @entity38 both passed away within three - months of each other			0
their owners are being forced to pay their premiums until march 2015 ' your family would n't expect to pay your health insurance premiums if you passed away so why should pet owners be forced to pay premiums after the death of the family pet ? ' @entity1 's policy is currently locked tight , with the wording of their clause causing confusion for customers who claim they were never alerted to the particular section			1
' in the event that you cancel the policy for whatever reason after having made a claim , no premium refunds are payable and the remaining premium for that period of @entity64 must be paid			0
' @entity68 residents @entity65 and @entity66 told @entity69 that they were ' vulnerable following the passing of their two cherished @entity72 dogs and @entity1 have given them no sympathy since			2
the couple owned their dog @entity38 since he was 6 - months - old and he was 9 - and - a - half when he died in october			0
they were also caring for @entity37 since he was 6 - weeks - old and he was thirteen when he passed away in june			0
@entity68 residents @entity65 and @entity66 told @entity69 that they were ' vulnerable following the passing of their two cherished @entity72 dogs and @entity1 have given them no sympathy since now they have been told by @entity1 that they must continue paying their insurance premiums until march 2015 for both @entity38 and @entity37 , even though neither of their deceased dogs will ever need to make another claim			1
mr @entity66 revealed that the couple are paying $ 100 - a - month in premiums to the insurance firm for both dogs and expressed his dismay at the firm 's practices			1
' when they both died very close to each other , we felt quite vulnerable , ' he said			0
' we notified the insurance company and when we contacted them by phone they said ' according to the contract you have to keep paying until the end of the first year ' , ' cookie the @entity98 was 7 - years - old when she passed away in august , however her grieving owner is still paying just over $ 78 a month for her insurance policy he said that @entity1 refused to be flexible , informing them that their only option was to continue paying their insurance premiums until the end of their contract			1
the couple were ' pretty shaken ' at first but decided to contact choice as they were ' disgusted ' at their insurance provider 's reaction			2
choice apparently have tried on multiple occasions to contact @entity1 , but to no avail			1
@entity118 said the couple had decided to buy pet insurance , as both their dogs were getting older and they were advised to get some cover by their vet			2
she said they did not do much research into the company and if they were to do it all over again they would definitely not pick @entity1			2
' it 's so underhanded , ' she said			0
cookie 's owner has been informed by @entity1 that she must continue paying her premiums until @entity135 's policy expires at the end of december 2014			1
cookie is pictured here with ms @entity140 's son @entity139 ' you 're already grieving for your pet and you do n't know what other circumstances are happening in people 's lives , ' she said it was outrageous that the same company representative was never available to speak to customers directly on the phone			0
' it 's all verbal , you do n't get any written acknowledgement , ' she said			0
' even when you try to call , you 're never speaking to the same person , it 's always someone else , ' ' when they 're actually selling , they allocate someone to you , ' @entity162 has launched a campaign to put pressure on @entity1 to change its policy ' you 're basically just a number , ' she said			2
@entity140 is another disgruntled @entity1 customer who has also had the heartache of dealing with the insurance company following her beloved pet dog cookie 's death			1
the @entity98 was 7 - years - old when she passed away in august , however her grieving owner is still paying just over $ 78 a month for her insurance policy			0
ms @entity140 has been informed by @entity1 that she must continue paying her premiums until @entity135 's policy expires at the end of december 2014			2
speaking to @entity69 , ms @entity140 said ' no one reads the fine print ' when you take out an insurance policy and ' you expect it to be common sense '			0
' with health insurance , you do n’t have to keep paying , ' she said			0
' if you make a claim , it does n't mean you ’re stuck with them for the whole year , you can change whenever you want to , ' ms @entity140 said			0
ms @entity140 has told @entity1 that she will be cancelling her remaining two dogs ' policies once their contract comes to an end			2
' it 's not right , they 're not covering her anymore , there ’ s noway they 're not going to be paying money out , ' she said			0
' it ’s not common sense , it ’s unfair			0
' choice has launched a campaign to put pressure on @entity1 to change its policy and amend clause nine from page 15 of the product disclosure statement , to read : ' in the event that you cancel the policy for whatever reason ( other than the death of your pet ) after having made a claim , no premium refunds are payable and the remaining premium for that period of @entity64 must be paid			1
' the amended policy would follows the decision earlier this year by @entity2 's largest pet insurer , @entity221 , to end the cruel practice			0
according to @entity12 's @entity20 , by simply adding the words ' other than the death of your pet ' @entity1 would align its product disclosure statement with @entity221 and alleviate a great deal of needless suffering among grieving pet owners			1
' when it comes to pet insurance clearly not all insurers are the same so it pays to do your research before committing to a pet insurance policy , ' says mr @entity20			2
' it 's also important to remember to choose your pet insurer wisely because once you have opted for a pet insurance provider , it is usually for the duration of the pet 's life			0
' ' we have found there is little scope for switching when it comes to pet insurance policies as any conditions your pet suffered from before the start of the new policy will be excluded , leading to more costly cover , ' he continued			0
