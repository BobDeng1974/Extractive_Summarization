by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 fisherman has filmed himself in a titanic battle with a human - sized yellowfin tuna he landed in stormy weather off the coast of @entity3			1
battling torrential rain and two - metre swells , experienced angler @entity8 caught the 76kg fish after it latched onto a rod specially rigged - up for the one - man fishing expedition 40km off @entity3 's coastline			1
after initially planning to ' call it a day ' after an uneventful saturday morning on the water , mr @entity8 headed for home before his prized - catch , a caught hold			1
the daring angler wrote in a fishing blog he was ' about to call it a day ' when a mate called him over to a spot where he was having more luck			0
en - route to the new location , mr @entity8 suddenly leapt to his feet when he heard the line to one of his eight rods start spinning ferociously			1
he wrote how he had ' happily been chugging along , through a couple of torrential downpours ' before his luck turned			0
preparing for what would eventually be a one - hour wrestle , mr @entity8 de-rigged the remaining tackle on board to give him more room to manoeuvre around the boat			1
he filmed the whole ordeal on camera which showed just how much of a fight the tuna gave him before he finally brought it to the side of the boat			2
after bringing it to the boat he battled to haul it aboard and used various solo fishing techniques mr @entity8 was holding on to a large hook attached to the tuna 's mouth when he brought it in ' just as stuffed as the fish : ' he used every once of strength to haul it on deck it was at this point he declared in the @entity74 blog that he was ' just as stuffed as the fish ' and admitted that he almost lost it when he took a rest			1
' the fish was stuffed and did n't do a great deal and so i tried to skulldrag the fish up and over the gunwale , ' he wrote			0
' just as stuffed as the fish ' mr @entity8 admitted he almost lost the prized - catch when he sat back down and dropped it overboard , because he did n't ' quite have the huff ' n ' puff left in me to go the extra yards			1
' ' i got the head and shoulders up and over the height of the gunwale but i was just as stuffed as the fish and did n't quite have the huff ' n ' puff left in me to go the extra yards			2
' ' reluctantly i dropped the tuna back to the water back to the water and made a couple more attempts without success , ' he wrote			0
' the whole episode was filmed with a @entity29 mounted to the front of the boat he said he waited for a decent swell to come up which helped him heave it on board mr @entity8 's boat was specially rigged for the game fishing expedition when he finally secured it with some rope and a ski hook , his only move was to then reef it over the side without managing to hook himself in the had			1
' i took a moment to catch my breath , dropped the tail rope off the ski hook and drew the fish 's head up to the gunwale			2
' ' i just waited for a decent swell to come up and heaved on the fish , getting him half up and over the gunwale and reefed back and the fish came spearing into the boat			0
' ' he said i was pumped , ' before sitting on the boat 's floor to reflect on his monster catch			0
' i sat there on the floor for a moment before moving the fish around and getting some @entity29 footage holding the fish up			0
' this is the downside of fishing solo , no one to get good quality pics while the fish is still lit up and looking its best , ' he wrote			0
on his way home he took the fish to be weighed at a station near @entity142 , in @entity3 's east , where it was gutted , and shared between two of his friends .			2

@entity8 caught the fish *unaided* during a sea trip outside @entity3
he was about to head for home when it latched on to one of his lines
the boat was specially rigged for the one - man fishing expedition
yellowfin tuna *retails* for about **$** *70* - **$** *90* per kilogram in @entity159
instead of selling it mr @entity8 *decided* to share the catch with two friends
