a rare frog which was thought to be extinct has been spotted in northern @entity1			1
the hula painted frog had n't been seen since 1955 , so when it was suggested that the time had come to officially declare it as extinct , few people objected			2
however , a newly published paper in the journal @entity8 has just revealed that in 2011 the frog was spotted in its native habitat of northern @entity1 's @entity10			1
the hula painted frog was thought to be extinct because it had not been seen since 1955			1
it has a pocked back and a black belly that is covered with white spots the hula painted frog is considered to be one of a rare class of ' living fossils ' , so - called because they have remained physically un-evolved over millions of years , and have few or no living relatives			1
it has a pocked back and a black belly that is covered with white spots			0
it was spotted by @entity25 , an @entity1 park ranger , who glimpsed it from his passing vehicle and caught it before sending a picture of it to professor @entity32 , a river ecologist at @entity1 's @entity34			1
speaking to @entity36 , professor @entity32 explained that he was shocked at what the image on his phone showed			0
he said : ' everything fell out of my hands			0
i forgot about my fever , jumped into my car and drove two hours north to see it			0

tests show that the frog is related to a group of amphibians that died out over 10,000 years ago			0
it was originally classified as a member of the @entity64 amphibian group , but the discovery of the ' living fossil ' has allowed scientists to carry out genetic tests and ct scans and accurately categorise it as part of the @entity59			2
professor @entity32 said : ' nobody ever had a chance to see a @entity75 because it went extinct in @entity76			0
‘ the only way anyone could see it was through looking at fossils			0
‘ but then with every characteristic that you look at in the current @entity10 painted frogs , it matches that of the fossils of @entity75 and not that of the @entity64 ... so this is a living fossil			2
