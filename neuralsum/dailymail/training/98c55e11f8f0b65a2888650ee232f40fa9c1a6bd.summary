thousands of patients , including those suffering from terminal breast and bowel cancer , could be denied life - extending medicines under plans to halt the ballooning cost of @entity9 ’s flagship @entity7			1
the body – set up specifically to fund expensive cancer treatments – has offered a lifeline to more than 50,000 patients since it was created in 2010			1
however , its £ 200 million budget was overspent by £ 30 million last year – leading to health bosses being forced to raid other parts of their funds			1
now @entity19 has announced it is to hold a month - long consultation to consider whether some of the most expensive drugs should be withheld from new patients to save money			1
@entity19 has announced it is to hold a month - long consultation to consider whether some of the @entity7 's most expensive drugs should be withheld from new patients to save money among the drugs that could be rationed are @entity31 , made by @entity33 giant @entity32 , which fights terminal bowel , breast , ovarian , cervical , and brain cancer , and costs almost a quarter of the @entity7 budget			1
bowel cancer drug @entity45 , breast cancer drugs @entity41 and @entity42 , and the pancreatic cancer drug @entity44 thought to be earmarked for the cuts			2
under the current scheme , patients in @entity19 can apply to access drugs deemed too costly under normal @entity19 rules if their doctor says their health will benefit			1
but health bosses say some of the 41 fund - approved drugs must be cut to ensure the body stays within budget , which this year was raised to £ 280 million , and make room for better new medicines			1
dr @entity61 , of @entity62 , said : ' we need the pharmaceutical industry to step forward and offer better prices			0
the question is , if they do n’t , what will happen to these patients ? ’ drugs that fail to prolong patients ’ lives long enough , or give them a good enough quality of life , will be removed , as will those that cost too much , even if they are highly effective			2
patients already on these drugs will be allowed to continue taking them , but access for new applicants will be stopped			2
the cuts could start as soon as next year , according to sources			0
last night , cancer charities warned that highly effective drugs already turned down by the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) on cost grounds , could also be removed from the @entity7 ’s list			1
patients already on these drugs will be allowed to continue taking them , but access for new applicants will be stopped dr @entity61 , of @entity62 , said : ‘ the fund is meant to be a safety net for expensive drugs			1
we know it has overspent , so it is right they ’re reviewing how it works			0
however , we are concerned some drugs might come off			0
‘ we need the pharmaceutical industry to step forward and offer better prices			0
the question is , if they do n’t , what will happen to these patients ? ’ @entity104 , of @entity105 , added : ‘ we risk going back to the bad old days where if @entity86 says “ no ” to a drug , there ’s no other option			2
’ however , some said the decision was overdue			0
@entity112 , founder of @entity114 @entity113 , said : ‘ the problem is this is a very emotional and politically sensitive area			0
but the rationalisation has to be done : the @entity19 is not a bottomless pit of money			0
' cancer charities will say everybody has to have everything			0
but what are you going to cut ? hearing aids for the elderly ? children ’s mental health services ? ’ experts have also queried whether the @entity7 has gone over budget at all			2
in the first three years , only £ 330 million of the £ 450 million earmarked was actually spent , with £ 120 million going back into the general @entity19 pot. professor @entity132 , of the @entity7 , said : ‘ to ensure patients continue to have access to the best innovative treatments , we must re-evaluate some of the drugs on the list			1
this is the right thing to do for patients			0

@entity7 was set up in 2010 to fund expensive treatments
the @entity19 body went £ *30million* over their £ *200million* budget last year
so health bosses are now considering rationing some of the pricier drugs
one of these is @entity31 - used to fight a range of different forms of cancer
cancer doctor asks ' what will happen to the patients ' denied vital medicine ?
