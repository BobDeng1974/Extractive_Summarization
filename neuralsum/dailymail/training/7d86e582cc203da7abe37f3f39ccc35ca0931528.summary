by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 12 may 2013 a photographer waited for three months in freezing temperatures to capture this dazzling display of light above the @entity6 in a set of spectacular photographs			1
@entity9 , 29 , camped in the @entity11 mountains throughout the @entity12 , hoping to photograph the breathtaking @entity13			1
he captured the natural phenomenon on april 13 , just days before he was due to leave the expedition			2
mr @entity9 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , took the pictures in @entity19 , @entity20 and hired a snowmobile to reach the perfect vantage point			1
while he waited for the lights , which are notoriously difficult to forecast , mr @entity9 , merged almost 4000 pictures of the sky taken from the mountain range			2
starry night : the @entity13 illuminate the sky above @entity19 , @entity20			1
the photograph looks like a @entity31 construct , but was taken using long exposure techniques fluorescent : @entity13 is a name for aurora , a natural light display			1
these shots of the aurora borealis are a reflection of recent solar activity which has caused some amazing light shows no need for a torch : @entity44 experienced brutal winter weather during his three - month wait			1
he said : ' the tent in some shots is that we stayed in and the only heating i had with me was scented candles so everything still smells of vanilla ' forget me not : the sky turns an unforgettable bright blue against the icy peaks of the rocky mountain range in freezing conditions he created a timelapse video of the display but revealed most people will never experience these incredible sights because there is too much light in cities			0
the pictures of of circular star trails are formed by merging multiple photos taken over the course of several hours			1
the movement of the @entity73 means the stars appear in different places in each image			0
he said : ' i have experimented with this type of photography before when i was in @entity80 but you ca n't really see the stars because too much light is given off in cities			0
' i went out into the mountains with the goal of shooting the stars over the mountains and then i just kept getting more ideas from there and going back for more			0
' in total i spent three months over the winter in the freezing cold getting the pictures together - camping out at night with my dog both covered in sleeping bags to stay warm			1
' all weather endeavour : at the end of his trip , mr @entity9 hired a snowmobile to make sure he could get the best view possible			0
he waited to see the @entity13 for three months , before they could be photographed in april optical illusion : some of the spectacular pictures , which are constructed by layering images on top of each other , look like they have been painted or drawn snowy peaks : mr @entity108 spent his expedition in the @entity111 mountain range			1
he said he camping out at night with his dog and a sleeping bag to stay warm brushstroke effect : the camera 's shutter stays open for longer , so more light is absorbed and a brighter image is produced			2
mr @entity120 's results are stunning ' the tent in some shots is that we stayed in and the only heating i had with me was scented candles so everything still smells of vanilla			0
' but it was definitely worth it to experience such beautiful skies			0
to make the timelapse video i layered between 3000 and 4000 pictures together			0
it took some time but it 's something i will never forget			0
' the paths of moving sources stand out in this form of photography , becoming clearer than the elements around them			0
long exposures are easiest to achieve at night - time or when the subject is a lot brighter than its background			2
the camera 's shutter stays open for longer , so more light is absorbed and a brighter image is produced			0
long - exposure photography is becoming popular for its ability to turn everyday objects into romantic portraits and capture sources of light in great detail			1
but after almost running out of patience he turned his attention to creating star trails - before his gruelling trip incredibly ended with the bright night sky being spectacularly lit up with stars and the aurora clashing overhead			1
psychedelic : the moving stars and aurora create an intense portrait of a landscape			0
the colour scheme makes the sight all the more incredible spectacular sky : some of the images are almost other - worldly in the way they brighten stars day and night : one of the rare daytime pictures proves long - exposure photography can be just as effective during the day , when used properly			2
