@entity0 wants a new era of success at @entity3 @entity3 are back where the story began , although 10 years ago @entity5 was still a hard - hat area and @entity7 and an 11 - year - old @entity8 were only starting to get to know each other			1
@entity0 and @entity10 will never underestimate the significance of that @entity13 win in @entity14 in 2005 , when @entity15 scrambled the winner and @entity17 told @entity19 ’s fans to shush			1
‘ it set us on our way , ’ said @entity0 , as he recalls his first trophy as captain , the first with @entity17 as manager and @entity24 as owner			1
‘ it gave us all a taste of what we wanted and we wanted more			2
it brought us closer together			2
’ two months later , @entity3 clinched their first league title for half a century and have barely stopped winning since			1
if they beat @entity7 in sunday 's @entity13 final , it will be a dozen major prizes in a decade			1
the 21 - month wait since the last one already represents quite a drought in @entity24 terms			2
it would also be the launch pad for a second @entity17 era and a first @entity3 trophy for recent signings @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
very few of @entity3 's current crop of players have won silverware at @entity54 @entity0 ( 3rd left ) joins team - mates in a high spirited training session ahead of sunday 's @entity13 final @entity58 ( left ) is trophy hunting after not playing in @entity3 's 2013 @entity61 final win keepers @entity49 ( left ) and @entity63 train ahead of the @entity5 showdown with @entity7 and @entity58 was at the club when they won the @entity61 in 2013 but did not play in the final , which means the bulk of the team has yet to experience winning something together			1
‘ we have got to go out and win trophies to put us right up there , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ this could be the first one for a few of the new players			2
it has been a couple of years since we won anything and it is an important competition			2
it means a lot to this club			2
‘ people write this competition off but the manager takes it really seriously and made it clear from the outset when we were away to the smaller clubs that we were in it to win it			2
‘ you can see that by the teams we ’ve put out all the way through and the next step is to go and win it			2
for me , it ’s huge			2
we look back on that 2004 - 05 season and it had a huge impact on our confidence and momentum			0
’ @entity15 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity19 in the 2005 @entity13 final @entity17 famously gestured for @entity19 fans to be quiet ( left ) before going on to win the league ( right ) @entity17 , speaking at a press conference , is back in a @entity5 final in his second stint at @entity54 @entity105 : 2004 – 05 , 2005 – 06 @entity106 : 2006 – 07 @entity13 : 2004 – 05 , 2006 – 07 @entity107 : 2005 ten years ago , @entity17 injected a winning mentality into a group of ambitious footballers hungry for success			1
‘ like everyone , i felt something different , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ that was clear from day one , and it rippled through the whole club			1
he has brought that back this time			0
’ @entity10 , like @entity17 , has returned and is preparing for @entity5 as his 37th birthday looms , aware this trophy is equally as important as it was in his first season at the club			2
‘ that gave us a big boost , ’ said the @entity120			0
‘ to know we could win something together if we all focused and really wanted to achieve something special was a big step for us			0
and winning it again would be a big step for this generation of players			2
’ @entity0 has praised @entity17 for returning a winning mentality in every competition they are involved in the @entity3 captain has challenged the club 's current crop to continue their winning ways @entity0 gets in a tangle with @entity139 ( left ) during the @entity13 semi-final defeat of @entity19 @entity3 have lost only once in seven domestic cup finals since @entity24 took control			1
the single defeat was against @entity7 in this competition and at this venue in 2008			1
‘ it was a real disappointment , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but you move on			0
we ’ve won major trophies since			0
sometimes it can have a positive impact because you do n’t want to relive those bad memories			0
’ of more concern for @entity17 ’s team may be the 5 - 3 defeat by @entity7 two months ago			1
‘ everyone is rattling on about that , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ but for me it was fairly comfortable for us at @entity159 when we won 3 - 0 ( in december )			0
‘ you get beat through the season			0
it ’s not our only defeat			0
i do n’t see it as a revenge thing			0
@entity10 agrees that winning on sunday will provide incentive for the next generation of @entity3 stars @entity10 scored in extra time in @entity3 's 2005 @entity13 victory over @entity19 @entity7 danger man @entity8 ( centre ) scores during @entity7 's 5 - 3 victory over @entity3 in january ‘ they are here to win it			1
they have come a long way through the competition and some tough games			0
we are here to win it and we have the squad to win it if we play well			0
but if we are not at our best and @entity7 are , we have seen they are very good			1
’ as for @entity8 , who scored two of the five at @entity186 on @entity187 , @entity0 added : ‘ he is a very good player , his movement is fantastic and he ’s in great goal - scoring form			1
there ’s a lot of quality throughout their squad			0
‘ i ’m surprised they ’re not higher in the league			0
they probably deserve to be higher			0
they ’re a really good squad and they ’ll only get better			0
you ca n’t single @entity8 out			0
there ’s a long way to go			0
he ’s got to do it year after year			0
for @entity205 ’s sake i hope he does			0
’ @entity3 will line up against their @entity207 rivals for the @entity13 final at @entity5 on sunday			1
