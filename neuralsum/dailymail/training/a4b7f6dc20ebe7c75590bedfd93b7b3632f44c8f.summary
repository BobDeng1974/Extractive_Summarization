by @entity0 @entity1 face a ‘ @entity11 ’ next season on their return to the @entity4 , with the @entity6 outfit faced with the prospect of a group including @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity13 ’ side will be seeded in @entity14 as a result of a four - year exile from the competition that has lowered their @entity19 ranking — and as a result will be handed a tough group			1
trouble ahead : @entity1 face a @entity4 group of death next season @entity1 will also be drawn against a second seeded team , which include @entity25 champions @entity10 , @entity27 champions @entity26 and @entity28			1
@entity29 and @entity30 lie in wait as two of the sides in @entity34			0
the easiest draw @entity1 can expect would be against the likes of @entity37 from @entity38 and @entity40 champions @entity39 from @entity41			1
back then : @entity1 have n't been in the competition since 2009 - 10 , where they exited at the group stage @entity45 have been forced to tackle groups of death in their three seasons in the competition , but will find themselves elevated from @entity49 to pot two next season owing to their progression to the knock - out stages of this year ’s @entity4 and @entity54 failing to qualify for the tournament next season			2
as a result @entity45 will avoid another second seeded side			0
however the @entity60 champions - elect are facing a £ 50million fine and restrictions on their @entity4 squad size and a wage limit for failing @entity19 ’s @entity59 rules			0
it is believed a @entity4 squad reduction could see the club restricted to using between 18 and 21 players			0
a normal squad size is 25			0
tough ask : @entity1 could face one of finalists @entity74 or @entity75 's @entity9 ( below )			2

@entity1 have been out of the competition for four yeas , *meaning* they will be seeded in @entity14
they could play some of @entity19 's *biggest* teams all in one group
@entity37 would be the best side to face from @entity38 and @entity39 from @entity41
