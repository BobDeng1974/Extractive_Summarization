@entity0 may not be defending his title , but @entity3 players will look to maintain their stranglehold on the @entity5 in @entity6 this week			1
@entity8 's @entity7 is favourite to spoil their plans after winning the @entity10 last sunday , the 27 - year - old claiming his second @entity12 title in @entity3 in the space of eight weeks			1
but home players have won the event every year since it began in 2010 , with former masters champion @entity16 winning the inaugural event and being followed into the winners ' circle by fellow major winner @entity20 ( twice ) , @entity21 and @entity0			1
@entity7 in action during the pro-am ahead of the @entity5 at @entity24 @entity27 @entity26 captain @entity25 hits an approach shot in practice ahead of the tournament @entity0 's win 12 months ago helped him top the @entity32 and secure a place in the field for the @entity35 , which is also being staged this week at @entity36			1
that leaves the likes of @entity21 and @entity39 to lead the home challenge , with @entity39 keen to keep the trophy in @entity3 hands			1
' it was my first time playing ( in 2010 ) and it was a big deal to see all the foreign players pull into @entity6 , ' said @entity39 , who finished 24th in the defence of his @entity10 last week			2
' since then the @entity5 always attracts a strong contingent of local and international players			2
the crowds are always fantastic , because they are lively but very neutral			0
they just want to watch some great golf and they cheer for everyone			0
it 's fun to play in front of galleries like that			0
' personally , i would very much like to put my name below @entity0 ' on the trophy before the international players have their day			0
' @entity60 of @entity8 tees off on the fifth hole during practice at the stunning @entity24 @entity27 @entity26 captain @entity25 is a notable name in the field but it is @entity7 , however , who looks most likely to gatecrash the home party			1
' i think if i did i 'd become one of the most hated people down here , so i 'm not sure if i want to win this week , ' @entity7 joked			1
' but obviously it would be great to get a victory down here as well			0
' it 's quite hard because we go from week to week so it still has not sunk in yet			2
i am on the crest of a wave and just want to keep riding it and hopefully keep going this week			2
i 'm looking forward to the task at hand , i think the wind is going to keep the scoring pretty fair and it should be fun			0
a buck crosses the fairway as home player @entity84 plays a shot thankfully for @entity87 the bucks stop with him able to hit his drive during the pro-am ' it 's a hell of a lot different to last week where we were just hitting the ball straight up in the air , it could be a massive change to what we are used to but i 've had a couple of days in the wind now to get used to it and a feel for the course			0
we are professional golfers for a reason , we should be able to adapt			0
' four of the players who finished runner - up to @entity7 last week - @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 - are in the field at @entity6 , along with @entity110 , who lost out in a play - off to @entity0 12 months ago			1
' i have fond memories of the place , it was a good week last year and hopefully i can have a good week again , ' @entity110 said			2
' last year i started well here to set the season off on a good tone and it 's always nice to get off to a good start			0
