by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:48 est , 20 february 2014 if you are bored of the plethora of copycat @entity6 games appearing in app stores and are growing tired of the addictive original , you could harness your creativity and make your own version of game			2
that 's just what one @entity14 - based hacker did by building a @entity17 shoebox version of the best - selling app using a handful of basic electrical components			1
@entity21 used an @entity23 sensor , two servo motors , a reed switch and magnets , all hidden inside a cardboard box to create her mechanical marvel			1
users have to steer a bird between green pipes			0
the @entity42 version was downloaded up to 50 million times , and attracted more than half a million reviews			0
it also topped the @entity35 download charts , although figures have not been released for the @entity49 version			0
but of course she also had to use her artistic skills too to make the coloured backdrop for the game			2
the @entity57 - based engineer and founder of @entity59 put the project together to prove that it is possible for most people to engineer their own version of the game , @entity55 reported			1
the clever mechanism means that the @entity6 scenery rolls and rolls as a player dodges the green tubes by tapping on the sensitive pad – a little like gamers tap on their smartphone screen			1
if players make a mistake and hit a tube , it 's game over and the lid of the shoebox slams shut so that they have to start afresh			1
demonstrating the continuing demand for the game , one viewer of ms @entity21 ’s @entity84 video that shows people playing on the bulky game said : ‘ if you ’re selling this , i ’ll buy it ’			2
following the sudden disappearance of the original @entity6 app on @entity35 and @entity37 ’s app stores , imitations of @entity6 popped up everywhere , after its creator confirmed that the original game is ‘ gone forever ’			0
@entity6 , the developer who pulled his highly successful and profitable app , revealed he did so because he thinks it was too addictive			0
the @entity101 @entity100 - based developer is believed to have walked away from a small fortune as it is estimated he could have made $ 50,000 every day in in - app advertising alone			2
@entity21 used an @entity23 sensor , two servo motors , a reed switch and magnets , all hidden inside a cardboard box to create her mechanical marvel ( pictured ) he told @entity113 that he created the app - which saw players tapping on their smartphone screen to navigate a pixelated birds though narrow pipes - to be played in a few minutes , in his first interview since he took his game away			1
it happened to become an addictive product			0
i think it has become a problem , ’ he said			0
‘ to solve that problem , it ’s best to take down @entity6			0
’ flappy bird was the most popular free mobile game on @entity130 and @entity37 's @entity42 play store			0
