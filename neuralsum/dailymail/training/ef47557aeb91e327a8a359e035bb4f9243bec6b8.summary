by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 14:01 est , 12 march 2014 when actress @entity3 , 81 , attended the @entity4 this year she had n't been seen in public for a while and her looks provoked much conversation			1
some were shocked by @entity11 's appearance and cruel comments were made			2
novelist @entity13 felt bad about that			1
so much so , she decided to post a picture of herself , in her most natural state , with no make - up in ' solidarity ' with the actress , using # itsokkimnovak			1
novelist @entity13 tweeted this using # itsokkimnovak the @entity21 reported how the author , known for her @entity24 series , then challenged others to tweet images of how they really looked and she was inundated ! @entity3 at the @entity27 and inset in her hey day @entity13 told @entity29 : ' i really felt bad for @entity3 , especially after reading a piece about how @entity32 preyed on her insecurities			1
then a friend pointed out to me that beauty and feminine beauty is such a big theme in my current book , after i 'm gone			0
' as part of my research , i 'd just spent three weeks talking about the options available to a beautiful woman of a certain generation , and how those options changed for her daughters			0
' it turned out @entity13 was n't alone in how strongly she felt about women ( and men ) being judged on the way they look and the ' solidarity ' images started pouring in from all over the world			1
@entity53 sent this close up image of her face @entity13 said : ' i think everyone , women and men , but especially women , become frustrated with the focus on appearance			2
and social media has provided a forum for ordinary people to be judged and ridiculed			2
so we now have more in common with celebrities in an odd way			0
' @entity68 joined in the support with her no make - up selfie too the ' raw ' selfies have been cropping up all over the place , including on @entity73 as well as @entity74 and @entity13 thinks they now total around 1,500			1
' because not everyone tags ( on @entity73 ) or uses the @entity74 hashtag , it really is impossible to quantify but i had it very reliably , from someone who does marketing , that 1,500 people did it within 48 hours			1
after that , it 's all anecdotal			2
one friend told me that she saw it being done by a group of @entity90 friends who did n't know the source			0
it just goes and goes			0
@entity95 was moved to post a photo of herself , inspired by @entity13 's selfie perhaps part of @entity13 's reasons for feeling compelled to stand up for @entity3 stem from some of her own experiences of being judged on her appearance , she she told @entity29 : ' six years ago , while on tour , i received an e-mail from a man who complained i did n't look like my author photo			1
" do you think that 's fair ? " he said			2
' i thought it was hilarious that someone would attend a book - signing because of the author 's author photo			0
and just this past february , a man came up to me at the @entity117 and asked if i could sign a book for him			0
he said , " i 'll admit , i picked you because i liked your photo the best			0
" he was polite enough not to signal disappointment with the real - life experience			0
' this man wanted to join in on the ' strangely moving exercise ' too the novelist said she must have looked at ' hundreds ' of photos over the past week , and ' with each one , the faces became more beautiful to me			0
when you look at hundreds and hundreds of bare faces , without the benefit of photoshop or professional lighting , bare faces start to look pretty good			0
' in a blog post headlined ' @entity137 : @entity3 , c'est moi ' she wrote : ' we need to stop lying about how people age			1
we need to own our botox , our fillers , our nose jobs , our liposuction ' want to send us your natural selfies ? tweet your pictures to @ @entity147 i 'm not wearing make - up , honest : another man in solidarity with @entity3 and @entity13 twitter user @entity152 gets in on the natural selfie action @entity154 , 47 , was also inspired by @entity13 's @entity155			1

@entity13 felt bad @entity3 's looks were *criticised* at the @entity4
in solidarity she posted a ' raw ' natural selfie on @entity74
thousands of people then did the same in support
around 1,500 have now posted ' *unflattering* ' images of themselves
@entity13 says we need to ' stop lying about how people age '
