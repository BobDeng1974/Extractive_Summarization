by @entity1 reporter published : 03:47 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 09:30 est , 19 october 2012 banned : @entity2 , 11 , has been removed from @entity3 in @entity4 a @entity6 schoolboy has been forced to stay at home after his school banned him from attending classes because he carries the gene for cystic fibrosis			1
@entity2 , 11 , carries the genetic mutation for cystic fibrosis but does n't actually have the disease and shows no outward symptoms			1
the disease is incurable and life threatening and causes the body to create a thick mucous that clogs the lungs and can cause deadly infections			0
but although it 's not contagious , people with the disease or the gene can pose a risk to each other through bacterial cross-contamination if they are in close contact			1
the disease effects about 30,000 @entity29 but more than 10 million @entity29 carry the defective cystic fibrosis gene without knowing it			2
@entity2 's parents say their son poses no risk to other pupils and are fighting the decision , made by @entity37 , in @entity4			1
teachers said @entity2 must be removed as an undisclosed number of other students at the school already have the disease			2
the school argues that , if @entity2 were allowed to continue attending classes , there is a risk of cross-contamination			2
@entity2 's parents , who said the school has overreacted , are waiting for a court ruling on the matter next thursday			2
@entity2 , 11 , pictured with his mother , carries the gene for cystic fibrosis but does n't have the disease the school says if @entity2 were allowed to continue attending classes , there is a risk of cross-contamination they say that their son does not have the disease and shows no symptoms - an assertion backed by the family 's doctor			1
they also claim they did the right thing in disclosing @entity2 's genetic predisposition to cystic fibrosis on a school medical form at the beginning of the year			1
but they did not expected the school to take such a hard line and bar @entity2 from the school			2
@entity2 's mother @entity71 told the @entity72 : ' they made this decision without seeing one medical record on my son			1
' home schooling : until a court rules on his future , @entity2 is attempting to continue his studies uninterrupted at home @entity3 : the school says that it has taken medical advice that removing @entity2 would be the ' zero risk ' option for other students she added : ' if i felt @entity2 was a risk to others , i would move him			1
i do n't want anyone to get sick			0
' @entity2 told today : ' i was sad but at the same time i was mad because i understood that i had n't done anything wrong			0
it feels like i 'm being bullied in a way that is not right			0
' at the heart of the problem lies conflicting opinion on the risk of cross-infection among cystic fibrosis sufferers , or those who are at genetic risk for the disease			1
the school says it has consulted with medical experts and has taken the ' zero risk ' option in removing @entity2 from the school			1
the plight of the @entity111 supports a @entity113 study last year that claimed students with allergies often suffered discrimination at school			0
the study , from the @entity119 , said affected children often felt isolated , stigmatised or left out of school activities			0
symptoms : while cystic fibrosis is mainly related to lung problems , it can also affect general growth , heart function , fertility , digestion and sinuses cystic fibrosis is a recessive genetic disorder predominantly affecting the lungs			1
it can also affect the heart , liver , pancreas and intestine			0
the name refers to the characteristic scarring ( fibrosis ) and cyst formation within the pancreas , first recognised in the 1930s			0
the disease can be treated with antibiotics and other medications but is only manageable , not curable			0
it is caused by a mutation in the gene that regulates sweat , digestive juices , and mucus			0
most people have two working copies of the gene , although only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis			2
if both parents have a mutation of the gene , cystic fibrosis will occur in their offspring			1
it is most common among @entity163			0
symptoms include salty tasting skin , poor growth and poor weight gain , frequent chest infections , coughing or shortness of breath			0
major symptoms appear in infancy , so late onset of the disease is uncommon .			0

@entity2 carries genetic mutation for cystic fibrosis , but does not have the disease or display any symptoms
parents told school about their son 's medical *history*
school consulted with doctors and took ' zero risk ' option of removing @entity2 from classes
while cystic fibrosis is not contagious , sufferers can pose a health risk to each other
