by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 @entity3 was three when she vanished from the @entity6 resort in @entity1 a former @entity8 commander has urged @entity10 police to search an abandoned well just 875 yards from the apartment where @entity3 vanished			1
the @entity12 has established that the uncovered shaft is on scrubland used as a campsite by @entity17 gipsies – and has been overlooked by @entity2 police			1
hidden from the nearby road , the well drops 30ft down to 12ft - deep water			1
‘ it is clearly known to locals and possibly to local criminals as a place to discard evidence from petty crime , such as handbags and other unwanted stolen items , ’ said @entity22 , who served 27 years with the @entity23 and , as commander of specialist operations , dealt with serious crime , from murder to rape and human trafficking			0
he added : ‘ whoever abducted @entity38 knew the local streets , alleyways and scrubland and used that knowledge to avoid detection			2
’ three years ago @entity10 police began a new investigation into the disappearance of three - year - old @entity38 – the daughter of @entity47 and @entity48 – who vanished from their holiday apartment in the @entity2 resort of @entity1 in may 2007			1
@entity23 officers recently searched scrubland near the resort , but they have not examined the well			2
local authorities only allowed @entity10 police to check areas where ground anomalies picked up by aerial surveys might indicate a grave site			2
location : an aerial photograph showing the @entity64 ' apartment in @entity1 , the abandoned well and the search area , which does not include the well mr @entity22 said : ‘ if this had been a yard - led inquiry from the outset , there is no doubt that the search would have been wider and more effective than that conducted by the @entity2 police			1
' the well would have been searched thoroughly at the time , probably by using divers to get to the bottom of this very difficult and dangerous shaft			0
’ mr @entity22 added : ‘ the @entity2 authorities have come a long way in letting the @entity8 conduct any inquiries , but they need now to take the final step and ensure the @entity8 team can conduct a really thorough search wherever they want			1
and in my experience that should include the well			0
’ both @entity8 and the @entity2 police declined to discuss whether the well had featured in their investigations			1
local residents said they could not recall ever seeing any police activity in its vicinity			2
from where @entity38 was snatched , her abductor could reach the well by walking 400 yards through empty back streets , climbing a low metal gate and continuing the rest of the way over scrubland			1
the @entity12 revealed last month that a prime suspect may have worked at a water treatment plant just 220 yards from the well			1
heroin addict @entity103 , who died in 2009 , was suspected of kidnapping @entity38 in a botched burglary after mobile phone records placed him near the @entity64 ’ apartment when she disappeared			0
last tuesday , at the request of @entity10 officers , local police quizzed four @entity2 suspects – including @entity111 - born @entity3 , 29 , who was questioned as a witness in 2007			1
@entity10 police sat in on interviews , but sources suggest they led to no new developments			2
the well is on land owned by two wealthy @entity10 property developers , who were unaware of its existence until @entity12 contacted them last week			0
the plot includes a derelict farmhouse surrounded by rubble and litter , including a pile of @entity130 paperback novels			0
an old mattress inside the tumbledown building suggests someone once slept there			0
one of the owners , who asked not to be identified , said : ‘ if they want to search on the land we have got no problem with it			0
we are not going to stand in anyone ’s way , but no one has contacted us			0
’ the @entity64 ’ spokesman said yesterday : ‘ @entity47 and @entity48 continue to have full confidence in the work being carried out by the @entity23 but will not comment on it			0
