adventure travelers hoping to head into space do n't have to take out extra life insurance ahead of their trips			1
private pilots and skydivers have to take out extra life insurance to cover the added risk of their pursuits ... but space tourists do n't need special policies for their high flying rides			1
however , that loophole is likely to disappear , slowly , after the fatal crash last week of a test flight for a space ship designed to take tourists into space			2
the main wreckage from the crash on friday that killed one pilot and injured another is spread over a five - mile area in the @entity22 in @entity23 these images show the @entity26 rocket separating from the carrier aircraft , left , and then disintegrating , right , during a test flight on friday @entity29 ( left ) was killed in the crash on friday , while co-pilot @entity30 ( right ) survived the loophole exists because @entity34 life insurance policies do n't ask about space tourism or exclude it from coverage , meaning insurers most likely would have to pay if the holder died on a space trip , insurance industry veterans said			1
insurance companies , which say they are considering what to do about space tourists after the @entity26 crash , are likely to start adding questions about space travel and may even explicitly exclude space coverage , the industry observers said			1
the companies themselves are taking a cautious approach			0
' if we had an applicant with such plans , we would postpone any underwriting decision until they returned , ' @entity53 spokeswoman @entity52 said			0
@entity59 's @entity26 broke up after its release from a launch plane high over the @entity22 on october 31 , killing one of two pilots			2
the craft is designed to carry six passengers on two - hour suborbital flights , including a few minutes of weightlessness			0
@entity26 's space program , backed by founder @entity69 and @entity70 , a @entity72 investment fund , is the most developed of several projects to develop space tourism , with about 800 deposits for a ride into space at up to $ 250,000 ( £ 157,000 ) a seat			0
@entity79 and actor @entity80 have signed up			0
other companies developing space ships include privately owned @entity83 and @entity84 , a startup owned by @entity86 founder @entity85			2
while current life policies probably would pay in the event of death , applicants for new policies should disclose space plans or risk a dispute with an insurer , said @entity95 , chief economist at the @entity96 , a non-profit trade association			1
insurers typically have up to two years after a policy is written to contest the application , allowing them to investigate whether the insured person has misrepresented facts			0
so it 's possible an insurer could avoid paying if someone bought a policy and died in a rocket crash during the two years period			2
' you know that insurers are going to look for some way to invalidate the claim if you had a ticket , ' said @entity112 , a fee - only insurance adviser based in @entity114			0
@entity115 said that it is paying close attention to the issue after the crash , but that there is too little safety data to assess the risk of space tourism			2
@entity34 life insurer @entity123 said it does n't have imminent plans to offer space tourism insurance			1
still , the industry is starting to gear up for space tourists , just as they cover satellite launches			0
@entity130 offers a policy that pays up to $ 5 million ( £ 3.1 million ) per space passenger or up to $ 20 million ( £ 12.5 million ) per trip , according to parent @entity134 , which announced the policy in june			2
' i suspect in insurance company offices all over the country right now - as a result of what 's happened to the @entity59 plane - it 's being discussed , ' said @entity144 , former insurance lawyer and chief executive who has authored or edited three textbooks on insurance law			1
it would take time , perhaps years , for those changes to be approved by all @entity34 state insurance commissioners , he noted			1
in deciding what to charge , insurers are likely to look at satellite policies , which range between 2.5 per cent and 10 per cent of insured value , @entity156 , a space insurance expert and member of the @entity161 's @entity160 advisory board			1
at that rate , a policy paying a million dollars would cost $ 25,000 ( £ 15,600 ) to $ 100,000 ( £ 62,550 )			0
' getting on a space flight is a material change in risk , ' he said , akin to strapping rocket boosters onto a car and asking for a new policy			0
' put yourself in the place of the insurer			0
would you charge the same premium ? ' but the data on human space travel is much more favorable , if limited			1
there have been no fatal suborbital manned flights and three fatal orbital space shots , including the @entity34 space shuttles @entity181 and @entity182 with 14 deaths , and a @entity185 flight that killed one , according to the @entity188 database			1
the fatal @entity59 disaster means life insurance companies could explicity exclude space tourism that puts the risk of fatal accident on a manned orbital or suborbital spaceflight at three in 306 or just under one per cent , the company said			1
given those numbers , and the few people who are likely to fly on rockets , ' you come up with a very , very , tiny , tiny probability ' of death , @entity144 said , and the company might conclude it is not worth charging extra .			0

current @entity34 life insurance policies do n't ask about space travel
this means they would have to pay out if holder died on space trip
@entity59 crash means companies could explicitly exclude space travel
