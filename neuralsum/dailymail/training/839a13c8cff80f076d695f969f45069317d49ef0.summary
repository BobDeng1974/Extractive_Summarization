by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 16:09 est , 30 december 2013 @entity3 : 18:33 est , 30 december 2013 a sinkhole in @entity5 that is already the size of 20 football fields is eating up more of the @entity7 after the level surrounding it cracked for the second time in less than two months			2
the 26 acre @entity9 developed in august 2012 , when a salt dome operated by @entity11 collapsed deep underground			1
a levee was built soon after to keep the salty and sometimes oily water out of the surrounding freshwater swamps but it is now oval with growth zones heading northeast and southwest			1
the @entity27 and @entity29 director @entity28 said monday that a new hairline crack was discovered sunday in exactly the same spot as the largest crack , that stretched about a foot wide , from october			0
the new crack had spread from a few feet on the levee top on sunday to all the way across it by monday , he said , adding that a second crack had formed along the inner side of the southern levee where the previous round of tremors had caused the levee to sink			0
@entity28 said its shape suggests a small section of levee top may slide into the sinkhole			2
huge : @entity28 said its shape suggests a small section of levee top may slide into the sinkhole enormous : the 26 acre @entity9 developed in august 2012 , when a salt dome operated by @entity11 collapsed deep underground since last week , micro-earthquakes have been increasing until around 180 per day were recorded near the sinkhole by sunday			1
this has halted work to fight the growing water mass. @entity5 state is suing @entity11 as it tries to recoup $ 12 million spent in an attempt to deal with the sinkhole , including bringing in a team of scientists			1
while no homes have yet been sucked in , officials warn that the gases being emitted could ignite , which would leave the @entity5 swamp looking like ' the @entity69 '			1
@entity28 filmed the sinkhole in august , uploading the @entity72 video to @entity73 showing it burping and sucking in trees in the throes of a violent growth spurt			0
tremors : since last week , micro-earthquakes have been increasing near the sinkhole and the failed @entity11 cavern , halting work on the sinkhole and totaling 180 per day by sunday levee : a levee was built soon after to keep the salty and sometimes oily water out of the surrounding freshwater swamps but it has cracked multiple times ' they 're going down , ' @entity28 says on the viral video of a grove of cypress trees			1
this week he spoke to @entity93 about the frightening expanse , which has largely emptied the town of @entity9			0
' how often do you see a tree go straight down ? ' he asked			0
state officials guess the sinkhole will expand from its current size to at least 40 acres over the next several years			2
it 's currently 750 feet deep in some points and has methane bubbling up from it			0
the sinkhole is located in a stretch of about 100 miles between @entity107 and @entity108 that is not - so - affectionately known as @entity110 for its 150 or so petrochemical plants and high incidences of cancer among residents			2
it is one of the most industrialized and polluted areas of the county , @entity93 reported .			0

the 26 acre @entity9 developed in august 2012 , when a salt dome operated by @entity122 collapsed deep underground
a levee was built soon after to keep the salty and sometimes oily water out of the surrounding freshwater swamps but it keeps growing , heading towards @entity128 and the @entity9 waterway
in late october , the earth - and - limestone levee sank a bit and cracks developed and new cracks have *emerged* as more residents leave the area
@entity5 state is suing @entity11 as it tries to recoup $ 12 million spent in an attempt to deal with the sinkhole
while no homes have yet been sucked in , officials warn the gases being emitted could ignite , leaving the @entity5 swamp looking like an *inferno*
