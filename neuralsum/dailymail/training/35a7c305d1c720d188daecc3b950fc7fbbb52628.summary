by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 20:02 est , 16 february 2014 @entity4 : 20:02 est , 16 february 2014 a big - game hunter from @entity6 is suing a @entity8 outfitter and a world - renowned hunting guide in @entity11 he accuses of turning his once - in - a - lifetime adventure of bagging a rare , wild argali sheep known as the ' @entity15 ' into a nightmare			1
@entity17 said in a lawsuit filed in @entity19 in @entity20 last week that he spent more than $ 50,000 pursuing the animal in the @entity23 mountains of northeast @entity11 near @entity25 's border in december 2012			1
the 65 - year - old electrician said he felt like he was literally on top of the world after he tracked , shot and killed a 400 - pound , big - horned ram with the coveted , spiraling horns at an elevation of 14,000 feet			1
but he was mortified two months later when he opened up the box shipped to his home in @entity35 to find the horns were not the 58 - inch - long ones from his trophy animal			1
' @entity15 ' : @entity17 claims the horns he was sent are not the horns that were on the animal he shot ' i could tell right away , ' @entity17 said			1
' the native montanan who grew up hunting deer on the eastern front of the @entity46 had stalked moose in @entity48 and red stag elk in @entity50			0
' but the thing i really wanted to do was a @entity15 sheep hunt , ' he said			1
he poured over books , guides and websites before settling on the excursion halfway around the world			2
' the biggest of the species is in @entity11			1
so i figured if i was only going to be able to do this once , i 'm going top shelf , ' he said			0
@entity17 and his guide , @entity63 , saw animals the first day but had difficulty tracking them partly because it 's hard to breathe at that altitude , he said			2
but the next day he said he ' felt lucky ' to land a prize with a rack in ' pretty good shape ... not all busted up from fighting			0
' the horns he ended up with are missing a few noticeable chips and weathered to the point he suspects they are at least two years old			0
@entity17 said @entity63 and the booking outfitter - @entity78 of @entity80 , @entity81 - first insisted the horns were the originals , then offered to send a replacement			1
rare : the wild argali sheep can be found in the @entity23 and is one of the rarest sheep in the world he 's demanding reimbursement or his original horns , but he said a possible exchange is complicated by international treaties governing hunting of argali , a threatened species in @entity11			1
only 60 permits are issued there annually for the sheep named after the 13th century explorer			0
the @entity102 considers the argali 's horns the ' most spectacular ' of all the world 's sheep , according to its record book			1
@entity17 shot his in the same region where @entity63 had served as guide about a month before for @entity110 of @entity111 , @entity112 , when he set a club record for landing one with horns more than 71 inches long			1
@entity17 said @entity78 co-owner @entity117 dismissed his concerns , telling him ' it 's just hunting			2
' ' granted , ' @entity17 said , ' you can have bad weather or you might not see any animals or you might miss the shot			2
' but to shoot the animal and take pictures of it and then not to get it , somebody has to be responsible			0
' @entity117 did n't immediately return calls or email seeking comment			0
the @entity0 was unable to locate @entity63			0
@entity11 : @entity17 traveled all the way to the @entity23 in @entity11 for a chance to hunt the rare sheep @entity17 said he contacted an @entity135 agent in @entity35 , who indicated he probably was a fraud victim but there was little authorities could do unless they found a number of other hunters who 'd also been duped			1
@entity135 spokesman @entity141 in @entity142 said on friday the agency could not comment			0
@entity144 , a @entity20 lawyer , said she filed @entity17 's lawsuit there because @entity63 and @entity147 advertise and do business there regularly at conventions of the @entity102 and the @entity151 , the latter of which named @entity63 to its @entity152 in 2009			2
@entity17 is seeking $ 75,000 in damages for lost money , ' worry , anxiety , loss of sleep , physical and mental distress			2
' ' i 've been fighting them more than a year			0
i finally got fed up and decided to do something about it , ' he said , adding he 's convinced others have been victimized			0
' i have this stuff sitting in my living room and every time i look at the horns , i just get that much more mad			0

the argali sheep is known as the ' @entity15 ' of goats and is amongst the rarest in the world
@entity17 traveled to @entity11 for a chance to kill one
@entity17 says the goat he killed had nearly *flawless* horns
the horns the outfitter sent him were chipped , and were not the same horns that were on the animal he killed
