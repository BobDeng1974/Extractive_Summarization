by @entity1 reporter published : 14:30 est , 8 december 2013 @entity3 : 17:10 est , 8 december 2013 science fiction has long speculated what it would be like to peek inside a person 's mind and find out what they are thinking			0
now scientists are one step closer to such technology after forging a new brain monitoring technique that could lead to the development of ' mind - reading ' applications			1
the breakthrough comes from a @entity20 study that was able to ' eavesdrop ' on a person 's brain activity as they performed normal functions by utilizing a series of electrodes attached to certain portions of the brain			1
the process , called ' intracranial recording ' , was tested on three epilepsy seizure patients who had been admitted to the hospital for pre-surgery observation , according to @entity36			1
a new study from the @entity20 has developed a new way to monitor the brain during visits , the patients had a portion of their skull temporarily removed so that intracranial electrodes can be attached to the exposed brain surface			1
they are then monitored for up to a week as the electrodes pick up electrical activity in the brain , allowing neurologists to observe the patients ’ seizures and pinpoint the exact portion of the brain from which the seizures are originating			1
the patients were confined to their rooms and were comfortable , pain - free and alert , making them perfect for understanding how the brain operates in normal scenarios			2
the patients were asked to solve mathematical equations and various true / false questions that appeared on a computer screen			1
some of the true / false questions required the use of simple mathematical calculation , such as verifying whether or not 2 + 2 = 5			0
after analyzing the patients ' electrode records from these experiments , the researchers saw a spike in the electrical activity of the brain ’s intraperietal sulcus when the patients performed calculations			1
results from the study identified brain cells that spiked in electricity when faced with mathematical equations			1
researchers discovered that ' when the subject is reminiscing , laughing or talking ' these cells are not activated they also found that activity in this brain region spiked several other times throughout the day			1
by watching back video recordings of the experiments , the research team discovered that whenever a number was mentioned - even just through words like ' many ' or ' more than ' - the same spikes were seen in the intraperietal sulcus , which was a very unexpected finding			2
the findings , which will be detailed in @entity92 , provide a new framework for studying for the brain works in normal day - to - day circumstances			0
' we ’re now able to eavesdrop on the brain in real life , ' lead author dr. @entity96 , associate professor of neurology and neurological sciences and director of @entity20 ’s @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , told @entity105			2
' the beauty of this paper is not just to report another experimental finding , but it is a breakthrough in terms of methodological advancement in terms of being able to record from brain activity in real life , natural conditions			2
' these nerve cells were not firing chaotically			0
the ways in which doctors and scientists are able to study the brain are limited because of the organ 's sensitivity			0
the new method , called intracranial recording , is being seen as a breakthrough in the area ' they ’re very specialized , active only when the subject starts thinking about numbers			1
' when the subject is reminiscing , laughing or talking , they ’re not activated			0
' thus , it was possible to know , simply by consulting the electronic record of participants ’ brain activity , whether they were engaged in quantitative thought during nonexperimental conditions			0
@entity96 said the success of the study meant that intracranial recordings could change the way researchers observe the brain			2
current brain monitoring techniques , such as magnetic resonance imagining ( @entity144 ) , do not provide a very accurate picture of the human brain in normal settings			0
' the mri scanner is several tons , and you ca n’t actually take an mri scanner home , but this ( apparatus ) is something you can walk with – as a patient of course , ' @entity96 said			0
' so subjects that are implanted with these spying electrodes , they were walking and talking … we have a new method by which we can study the brain activity in natural environments , so it ’s totally different than other experiments			1
' @entity96 said this technique has the potential to lead to very beneficial medical applications , especially for patients whose brains or nervous systems have been severely damaged			1
the future : it is hoped the findings of the new study will one day allow for people who can not speak to be implanted with brain chips that could allow machines to talk for them ' if we ’re able to decipher the code of brain activity , let ’s say beyond mathematics , then patients who are unable to speak , for example ( due to ) stroke , or are unable to move , we could use this deciphering method to communicate with machines so that machines can do ( the talking ) , ' @entity96 said			1
' or we can somehow try to understand what ’s going on in the brain activity without even patients talking			2
' while some experts have speculated that @entity194 ’s new technique could one day be used in a sinister way to read a patient ’s private thoughts , @entity96 said that is still a very fictional concept			0
' this is too far - fetched			0
we are not there yet			0
we are light years away from mind - reading , ' @entity96 said			0
' i do n’t want people to get scared that doctors are mind - reading their patients			0

@entity20 develop new way to monitor brain technique
called ' intracranial recording ' , it involves removing a section of the skull and attaching electrodes to exposed brain surface
following tests on three epilepsy patients , researchers found there were spikes in electrical activity whenever the subjects were faced mathematical equations , even just with words like ' more than ' or ' many '
the results mean potential new medical applications , such as brain chips that grant people who can not speak a way of communicating
