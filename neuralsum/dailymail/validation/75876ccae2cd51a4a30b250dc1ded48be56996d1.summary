@entity1 neuroscientists claim low alcohol red wine produces more brain activity in ‘ taste processioning ’ areas , then stronger tipples			1
a stock image is shown you might imagine that stronger wine would pack more of a punch in the flavour department			2
but @entity1 neuroscientists claim that red wine with a low alcohol content produces more brain activity in ‘ taste processioning ’ areas , then stronger tipples			1
while the low alcohol bottles may not contain more flavour per se , people pay more attention to ‘ fruity bouquets ’ and ‘ woody notes ’ so the wine appears to be tastier			1
neuroscientists led by @entity23 , of the @entity25 centre of @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity1 , wrote in their study , published in the journal @entity30 : ‘ over the last few decades , wine makers have been producing wines with a higher alcohol content , assuming that they are more appreciated by consumers			1
‘ to test this hypothesis , we used functional magnetic imaging to compare reactions of human subjects to different types of wine , focusing on brain regions critical for flavour processing and food reward			2
’ they noted that 30 years ago , it was typical for red wines to contain around 12 per cent alcohol , while now quality tipples can be 15 per cent			0
this is because wine makers ‘ seem to … assume that strong wines are , on the average , more appreciated by wine consumers , ’ dr @entity23 said , adding that they seem more intense , which is considered desirable by some foodies			0
to reveal that stronger wines are n’t necessarily better , his team measured the brain activity of 21 volunteers in a @entity62 scanner			1
during the scan , the volunteers had the enviable task of sipping samples of different red wines where one was low alcohol and another stronger , but they tasted similar			1
the researchers measured the brain activity of 21 volunteers in a @entity62 scanner while they sipped red wine			1
they found : contrary to expectation , significantly greater activation was found for low - alcohol than for high - alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity , including the insula as well as the cerebellum			1
an image from the study showing brain activity triggered by wine is shown ‘ contrary to expectation , significantly greater activation was found for low - alcohol than for high - alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity , including the insula as well as the cerebellum ' , the researchers wrote			1
in fact , there was no part of the brain that responded more strongly to the more alcoholic wine , meaning that strong wines ‘ induce weaker activation relative to the low - alcohol content ones ’			1
this may be because people paid more attention to the flavours of the less potent wine , even though they are not more flavourful themselves , @entity99 reported			2
the experts hypothesised : ‘ the low - alcohol content wines induced a greater attentional orienting and exploration of the sensory attributes of wines relatively to high - alcohol content wines			2
’ wine critics have previously said that @entity113 , or high alcohol wines , often lack the finesse of less potent options , because the alcohol overpowers some of the more subtle aromas and flavours			2
‘ the findings raise intriguing possibilities for objectively testing hypotheses regarding methods of producing a highly complex product such as wine , ’ the researchers wrote			0
wine critics ( stock image ) have previously said that @entity113 , or high alcohol wines often lack the finesse of less potent options , because the alcohol overpowers some of the more subtle aromas and flavours dozens of cheap and popular @entity133 wines are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic , claims a new lawsuit filed this week			2
@entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity141 's @entity140 , also known as ' @entity142 , ' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe			0
twenty - eight @entity133 wineries were listed in the complaint , which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question			0
a new lawsuit claims dozens of cheap and popular @entity152 , including @entity139 and @entity141 's @entity153 , are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic the lawsuit was filed by four individual @entity133 wine consumers who , according to their attorney @entity156 , had 1,306 wines tested at a @entity159 - based laboratory and then confirmed results with two additional laboratories			0
@entity156 said 83 wines , almost all of which sell for below $ 10 a bottle , contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water			0
the @entity171 standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard			0
' this is a very serious public health concern , ' @entity156 said			0
' we would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately			0
' ' if not voluntarily , we would ask the court to do it			0

@entity1 neuroscientists gave volunteers samples of red wine to drink while they scanned their brains in an @entity62 *machine*
one sample was low alcohol while the other was more potent
they found that weaker wine better stimulated areas of the brain that are sensitive to taste intensity , including the insula and cerebellum
experts say the weaker wine may have tasted better because the volunteers paid more attention to the flavours than the stronger tipple
