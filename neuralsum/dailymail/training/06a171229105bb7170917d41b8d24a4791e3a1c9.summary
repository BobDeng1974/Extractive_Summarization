by @entity0 @entity1 are evaluating the cost of a deal for @entity5 striker @entity4			1
manager @entity6 is resigned to the fact that @entity9 's @entity8 is joining @entity10 this summer , while @entity12 's @entity11 , who is still recovering from a knee ligament injury , would be an expensive risk			1
scouts have been in @entity16 continuing to monitor @entity18 's @entity17 and @entity20 's promising @entity19 but @entity4 represents the ready - made centre forward			1
@entity23 man : @entity1 are weighing up a deal to sign @entity5 striker @entity4 this summer reluctant sellers : @entity5 are said to want to keep the @entity27 forward , but he is after more playing time @entity5 are reluctant to sell but @entity4 wants regular football and has one year left on his contract			1
the 27 - year - old came on as a substitute for @entity34 against @entity35 and gave @entity5 's attack even greater threat			1
the @entity38 is clever in his movement , aggressive , technically adept and good in the air			0
@entity4 believes his performances and goals record warrant a regular place in @entity46 's starting line - up but the summer arrival of @entity48 from @entity49 will only serve to restrict his game - time further			1
@entity51 is also a confirmed fan of @entity4 having tried to sign him for @entity52 in the past but @entity35 remain keen on @entity53 at @entity54 for now			1
hit list : @entity57 left - back @entity56 is also on @entity6 's list of potential transfers @entity60 : @entity1 boss @entity6 will be under pressure to reinforce his squad this summer meanwhile , @entity1 have checked on @entity57 defender @entity56			1
the 24 - year - old @entity63 - who has also been watched by @entity65 , @entity35 and @entity66 - has been booked eight times but has been impressive at centre - back during @entity57 's rise to second in the @entity71 league table			2
however , he plays left - back for @entity74 and that is an added attraction for his @entity78 suitors who are all seeking to strengthen that position			0
@entity52 weigh up @entity82 alternatives due to £ 25m hurdle @entity52 remain in the frame for the permanent signing of @entity82 , but @entity10 's asking price of around £ 25million will be an obvious stumbling block			1
manager @entity88 has had scouts monitoring other forwards in @entity91 and @entity16 with the likes of @entity93 at @entity94 , @entity95 of @entity96 and @entity97 of @entity98 among names discussed but a permanent deal for @entity82 remains his dream ticket			2
the 20 - year - old is keen to play in @entity104 competition next season and @entity52 's finishing position could prove crucial in terms of standing and new finance			2
@entity82 's camp would prefer to wait until after the @entity111 when more clubs are anticipated to show an interest			2
options : @entity52 remain firmly in the hunt to sign @entity82 , a player they have on loan from @entity10 in demand : @entity52 are n't the only club vying for @entity119 are also talking about a deal this summer the @entity123 international 's agent @entity121 has confirmed a conversation has taken place with @entity119			1
talking to @entity127 newspaper @entity126 , @entity121 said : ' i ’m looking for a club for @entity82			2
and yes , i ’ve talked to ( @entity131 chairman ) @entity130 once , but that does n't mean @entity82 will join @entity131			2
that 's not a talking point at this moment			0
' although @entity10 are reputed to want an option on @entity52 midfielder @entity136 in any negotiations for @entity82 , the 20 - year - old @entity136 is keen to stay at @entity52 and further his development under @entity88			1
contract talks are expected in the summer			0
no deal : @entity52 are adamant that any deal with @entity10 for @entity82 would n't include @entity136 @entity143 will rival @entity144 in a renewed battle for @entity146 this summer			1
both clubs showed an interest in the @entity150 winger in january and will resume talks over a £ 3million deal at the end of the season			1
@entity144 were rebuffed in two bids for @entity146 before settling on a deal for his team - mate @entity157 , who was considered the greater priority by manager @entity160			1
wanted : both @entity143 and @entity144 are expected to fight it out for @entity150 's @entity146 ( left ) sporting director @entity162 wants a more @entity78 - themed recruitment policy to @entity144 's transfers and at 24 years - of - age @entity146 fits into that profile along with the likes of @entity168 's @entity167			1
palace manager @entity169 could be in a stronger position to tempt @entity146 with his side favourites at this stage to stay up , although @entity169 himself will be in demand following his exploits at @entity175			0
@entity176 , meanwhile , are among clubs to have shown an interest in @entity143 goalkeeper @entity179			0
@entity181 's agent has dismissed the prospect of the @entity65 defender moving to @entity184 in the summer			1
@entity181 has revived his career at @entity186 after being on the brink of leaving , with his former boss @entity188 keen to take him to @entity189 however , the @entity191 's agent @entity190 said : ' there is no chance for @entity181 to go to @entity184			1
what i can say is that @entity181 will not go to @entity184			1
@entity181 will remain at @entity65			0
' staying put : @entity181 's agent has said the @entity65 stopper will not be leaving @entity186 this summer @entity184 do remain strong candidates to sign @entity199 on a permanent deal			1
meanwhile , representatives of @entity184 's @entity203 midfielder @entity202 are understood to have spoken to @entity119 to gauge interest			2
the 28 - year - old is keen on a move to @entity207			0
@entity209 's very own livewire striker @entity208 will be looking to impress tonight against @entity210 in the crucial @entity212 clash			0
a win for either side would put them into the play - off positions and @entity208 will be looking to add to his tally of 28 goals in 31 games this season			0
staff from @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity176 , @entity225 and @entity226 are all due at the game to watch the 25 - year - old striker who has scored seven in his last four games			0
