as a result , the @entity8 had to book two hotels in @entity12 before sunday night ’s @entity14 qualifier against @entity15 to ensure administrative staff are in a separate hotel from @entity2 ’s squad — even when staying for only one night			1
this new two - hotel policy , which was also used in @entity20 ahead of the first qualifier against @entity22 , resulted from a number of internal debriefs following the debacle in @entity26			0
@entity4 manager @entity2 plus his players and tracksuit assistants stay separate from the rest they have been split up from the rest of the @entity8 travelling party on away trips to remain focused on their task @entity2 felt there were too many @entity8 personnel and associated staff around the players during the @entity1 , particularly at meal times and on match days — not surprising when the @entity8 party for the tournament climbed to over 80			1
the @entity8 , who take far fewer to an away qualifier , are not the only ones with this strategy			2
world champions @entity46 are said to have split their delegation — which is even bigger than @entity4 ’s — between four hotels in @entity26			2
however , i ’m sure @entity2 , @entity51 will be delighted to know that the best accommodation in @entity12 — the grand @entity52 in the @entity53 where @entity54 stayed and big enough for a team meeting — was allocated by the discerning travel company to your @entity58 columnist			1

but the @entity8 must try to make @entity4 ’s travelling support membership more diverse			2
it was very noticeable in @entity12 that the fans following @entity4 were almost all white			1
@entity64 became the first black footballer to join the @entity66 and was the first to receive a cbe too the @entity8 have yet to decide on their base in @entity79 for @entity80 , but the priority is that the hotel and training base should be on the same complex or very close together			1
the trouble in @entity26 was n’t just the hour - plus journey between the two , but the huge difficulty of a second visit later in the day without a police escort			0
@entity4 arrive at their hotel in @entity91 during the summer 's @entity93 tournament in @entity26 the trouble was n’t just the hour - plus journey in @entity26 but the difficulty of a second visit without a police escort @entity4 fans in @entity12 on sunday again voiced their considerable upset at the @entity8 switching the double value of points / caps from supporters attending away games to home @entity105 matches , with filling the national stadium the main concern of the @entity8			1
this thinking makes it all the more unlikely the @entity8 will take @entity4 on the road — with the governing body aware that taking the odd unattractive fixture elsewhere might be viewed as condescending			2
@entity4 fans in @entity12 voiced opinions at the @entity8 switching the double value of points / caps from away to home @entity116 has been brutally honest in his book , but legend in @entity119 has it there was a lot more to his flare - up with @entity124 at @entity125 after he was dropped and stripped of the captaincy when agitating for a move to @entity128 than a bit of ‘ effing and blinding and pushing and shoving ’			1

@entity116 promptly wrote something down and thrust the piece of paper at @entity124			0

@entity146 , who would have gained the rights if the @entity142 had gone for the territory - by - territory option , will now have to wait until 2019 to compete against @entity137 for @entity4 test cricket			2
@entity137 , who will pay @entity157 around £ 150m , have been intent on closing doors on @entity146 ’s entry into other sports since the blockbuster loss to them of the @entity163			0
meanwhile @entity146 plan to present some of next season ’s @entity163 matches from newspaper offices around @entity14 to tap into the knowledge of football journalists			0
