@entity0 ’s first sniff of goal fell to @entity72 ’s @entity14 , having his best campaign yet on the fringes of @entity76 ’s first team , but his daisy - cutter from range lacked power			1

it did n’t take long for @entity1 to find the breakthrough in the second - half			2
from their first attack , the ball was worked quickly across from the right wing and there was @entity55 , completely unmarked , to sidefoot past @entity23 from close range			2
it was a frustrating goal to concede and @entity1 offered little respite			2
the half - time substitute @entity58 curled a shot just over and the visitors looked the more likely to score			0
@entity46 introduced one @entity197 man for another when @entity31 came on for @entity30 , while @entity33 of @entity198 replaced @entity32			0

we only showed in flashes what we 're all about individually and as a group			0
' i thought they were by far the better team first half , we played a little more brave in the second - half and towards the end there was only one team that was going to win the game			0
' but it certainly was a hard - fought one and we were up against the ropes at times			0
' we tried out a new system tonight because of the lack of availability of our wide players and we might need to go to @entity236 and play that			0
so it 's a good experience			0
