while limited - edition holiday drinks have become a festive tradition , many of them contain unhealthy levels of fat and sugar			0
but one high street chain has brought out a slimming one - calorie @entity9 spicy coffee - so you actually lose weight just by drinking it			1
the @entity14 coffee is infused with flavours of @entity9 candy , dried fruit and hints of pine and therefore needs no sugar , milk or syrup			1
and as calories are burnt just in the act of drinking and digesting the coffee - you are using up more calories than are actually in the cup			0
this naturally fragrant coffee , cultured by one of @entity25 + @entity26 's growers in @entity47 , uses the ' honey process ' to help keep the natural sugars from the coffee cherry			1
this means the coffee beans , which are a type of fruit , retain their sweetness , and the resulting drink needs no added syrup , toppings or cream to lend it such			1
@entity60 , head of coffee at @entity25 + @entity26 , said : ' with overtones of candy , pine , the dried fruit of @entity9 cake and even a whiff of wood smoke , everything in this filter coffee is reminiscent of the best bits of @entity9			1
' the mastermind behind it , @entity72 , is something of a @entity75 in the coffee world as his new process helps beans retain even more of their natural sweetness			1
' the result is a calorie - free @entity9 coffee with flavours that speak for themselves			1
mr @entity60 added : ' @entity9 feasting is hard enough on the waistline			1
' a coffee does n't need to add to the calorie overdose by being packed with sugar			2
' just as you would n't use a fine bottle of plonk to make mulled wine , a coffee this good needs no added sugar			2
' a recent @entity97 study of high street coffee chain festive drinks found major brands like @entity101 and @entity102 had high sugar and high calorie contents			2
out of 20 different festive drinks on sale at @entity102 , @entity101 and @entity107 , just four had less than a woman 's daily recommended sugar intake of 25g ( approximately five teaspoons )			2
the worst offender - a @entity102 skimmed @entity111 and @entity112 with whipped cream - contained a ' shocking ' 61g or 15 teaspoons - the equivalent to around two @entity114			0
a grande honey and @entity112 from @entity102 - made with full fat milk and topped off with a frothy crown of whipped cream - contains 524 calories			0
this is a quarter of a woman 's daily allowance ( 2,000 calories ) and more than the 508 calories nestling inside a @entity126 's @entity125 meanwhile seven of the skinny drinks - @entity102 ' chai tea latte , honey and @entity112 ( without whip ) , @entity131 ( without whip ) and @entity133 ( with whip ) , and @entity101 's @entity135 , caramel and chai lattes - had more sugar than their full fat equivalents			1
the @entity140 recently reviewed its guidelines on how much sugar should be incorporated into a healthy diet			0
while it has previously recommended men consume no more than 70g and women 50g a day , those guidelines have been slashed to 35g and 25g respectively			0
this equates to no more than nine for men and six for women			0
diets high in sugar can increase a person 's risk of heart disease , type 2 diabetes and tooth decay			2
dietitian @entity159 told @entity97 while it is important for people to indulge in a festive treat at this time of year , they should be considered just that - a treat			0
the danger , she said , is that people popping into their local cafe will choose a tempting festive special and not realise the number of calories it contains			0
' people go into coffee shops thinking , ' i 'll just grab a coffee ' , ' she said .			0

@entity25 + @entity26 's @entity14 coffee beans are infused with @entity9 candy
