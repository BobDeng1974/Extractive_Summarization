change : teachers who have been convicted of smoking cannabis , using amphetamines or shoplifting will not be banned from the classroom , state rules which have come to light teachers convicted of drug offences or theft are to be allowed back into the classroom			1
a criminal record for smoking cannabis , using amphetamines or shoplifting need not bar them from continuing their jobs , official guidance states			1
certain gambling , alcohol and driving offences are also not enough to see a teacher removed from their post , the @entity15 said			1
last night campaigners said routinely allowing such offenders to continue to teach would set a bad example to their pupils			1
‘ the job of a teacher is not just to impart knowledge to learners , it is to give them moral guidance , ’ said @entity26 , from the @entity28 think - tank			1
‘ you ca n’t give moral leadership if you yourself do n’t set an example			2
‘ if you ’ve been found guilty of the possession of drugs , it implies you at least use them			2
’ the official guidance from the @entity15 has been sanctioned by the @entity44			1
it covers when disciplinary panels should issue prohibition orders , which bar teachers whose conduct has fallen below expected standards from working in any classroom			0
the guidance tightens the rules in some areas – making it clear that teachers guilty of sexual misconduct and / or any crime involving indecent images of children should be kicked out , as should those convicted of supplying drugs			1
but for other drug offences leading to a conviction or caution , teachers should not be prohibited from teaching unless class - a substances – such as heroin , cocaine and ecstasy – are involved , it says			2
offences involving class - b and @entity74 drugs , including cannabis and speed , would not mean an automatic prohibition order			1
last night , a @entity44 source said : ‘ obviously , teachers should be strongly disciplined if they have committed theft or used drugs			2
we are absolutely clear that teachers can be banned for life			0
example : we need teachers to give moral leadership for children , which drug offenders can not do , critics claim ' heads are responsible for considering whether a lesser punishment , such as suspension or dismissal , is more appropriate			1
’ a @entity44 spokesman said : ‘ what is important is keeping children safe			0
but it is also important that cases are dealt with individually , based on the specific circumstances			0
' we have tightened guidelines to make the system tougher than ever			2
' the spokesman added : ' it is wrong to say that teachers wo n't be barred for these offences			0
' but mr @entity26 said : ‘ it would not be compatible with a teaching job if someone is found guilty of an offence of drug possession			0
it would imply that the teacher did not feel there was anything wrong in taking drugs , which hardly sets a good example			0
’ the same principle applied to theft , he said			0
' you ca n't give moral leadership if you yourself do n't set an example ' - @entity26 , @entity28 think - tank @entity124 , of the @entity125 , said : ‘ although a lifetime ban from teaching would in many cases be too severe a penalty for more minor offences , schools and professional conduct hearing panels can not afford to turn a blind eye			0
‘ in order to safeguard the reputation of the teaching profession and to send a clear message to pupils that drug , alcohol and theft offences – no matter how minor – are not to be tolerated , some form of disciplinary action is called for			1
’ the @entity15 guidance says each case needs to be considered on its merits , raising the prospect that teachers convicted of very serious offences could be allowed to continue to teach in some circumstances			1
latest figures show that , in 2012/13 , 98 prohibition orders were issued			0
four years ago , an investigation found that dozens of teachers with convictions were being allowed to stay in the classroom			0
some guilty of crimes including harassment , battery , assault , indecent exposure , indecent assault and possessing class - a drugs had not been banned .			0

rules from @entity15 passed by @entity167 allows cannabis and gambling criminal records
critics warn drink , drug and driving offenders set bad example for pupils
guidance on sexual misconduct and supplying drugs tightened
