by @entity0 published : 11:37 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 12:38 est , 26 september 2013 athletes such as @entity2 have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness , according to a new study scientists have discovered a certain genetic characteristic , or genotype , is more common in power athletes like sprinters than in normal people and even endurance athletes			1
@entity2 and @entity13 have distinct genetic codes that give them their explosive and sustained fitness , according to a new study			1
@entity17 researchers found the variety of the angiotensinogen ( @entity20 ) gene is two to three times more common in elite power athletes than nonathletic people			1
the adjustment to the @entity20 gene may alter how the renin - angiotensin system performs , changing the way blood pressure , body salt , and fluid balance are regulated in the body			0
but scientists think the characteristic might give the likes of @entity2 a boost by increasing the production of a hormone called @entity20 , which is crucial for muscle performance			0
genetic tests on @entity17 international elite power and endurance athletes who had competed in @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity46 , or @entity47 as well as non athletes , were carried out by dr @entity49 in @entity17			2
overall , 100 power - oriented athletes , including sprinters , jumpers and power lifters as well as 123 endurance athletes , such as long - distance runners , swimmers and rowers were tested , while 344 non-athletes were studied for comparison			0
they found the adjustment to the @entity20 gene was found in 40 per cent of power athletes , compared 18 per cent of non-athletes , while it was found in just 13 per cent of the endurance athletes			1
however , results published in @entity64 showed there was no real difference between the higher and the lower ranks of elite power athletes who had the gene			2
100 power - oriented athletes , including sprinters like @entity13 ( pictured right ) , plus 123 endurance athletes and 344 non-athletes were studied for comparison			0
scientists found the adjustment to the @entity20 gene was found in 40 per cent of power athletes , compared 18 per cent of non-athletes the scientists pointed out that while the characteristic was nearly three time more common among the power athletes than endurance athletes , the exact effect the gene had on strength and performance was yet to be determined			1
pinpointing the exact genes that make people stronger or faster will have implications for all sports and their elite competitors in the future , according to dr @entity49			0
she said : ' identifying genetic characteristics related to athletic excellence or individual predisposition to types of sports with different demands ( power or endurance oriented ) or even sport specialty may be decisive in recognizing athletic talent , and probably will allow for greater specificity in steering of sports training programs			0
