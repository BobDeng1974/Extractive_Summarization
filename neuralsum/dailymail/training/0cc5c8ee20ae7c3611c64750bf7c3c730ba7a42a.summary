a single dose of antidepressant medication is enough to produce dramatic changes in the brain within three hours , a study has found			1
volunteers had their brains scanned after taking the widely - prescribed drug escitalopram , marketed in the @entity8 as @entity9 and @entity9 in the @entity10 the drug is a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( @entity13 ) and aims to boost the level of this ‘ feel - good ’ chemical in the brain			1
study leader dr @entity26 , from the @entity27 in @entity28 said : ' we were not expecting the @entity13 to have such a prominent effect on such a short time scale or for the resulting signal to encompass the entire brain			1
' the scans , which measured blood flow , showed that the drug reduced connectivity in most parts of the brain			2
but there was an increase in connectivity within two specific brain regions , the cerebellum and thalamus			0
although @entity13 are among the most widely studied and prescribed antidepressants , it is still not entirely clear how they work			2
serotonin is a neurotransmitter - a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain )			1
it is thought to have a good influence on mood , emotion and sleep			2
after carrying a message , serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells ( known as ' reuptake ' )			0
@entity13 work by blocking ( ' inhibiting ' ) reuptake , meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells			1
@entity13 drugs aim to boost the the level of the ' feel - good ' chemical serotonin in the brain			1
until now , the effects had been thought to take place over a period of weeks , not hours dr @entity26 said : ' what we are seeing in medication - free individuals who had never taken antidepressants before may be an early marker of brain reorganisation			1
' she added the new findings represent an essential first step toward clinical studies in patients suffering from depression			0
the next step is to compare the brains of those in recovery and those of patients who fail to respond after weeks of @entity13 treatment			1
dr @entity26 said : ' understanding the differences between the brains of individuals who respond to @entity13 and those who do n't could help to better predict who will benefit from this kind of antidepressant versus some other form of therapy			2
' we hope our work will help to guide better treatment decisions and tailor individualised therapy for patients suffering from depression			0
' the research is published in the journal @entity108			0
a widely - used antidepressant could help slow the onset of alzheimer ’s disease			0
scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce the formation of plaques in the brain , which could go some way to warding off the disease			0
the @entity10 academics admit it is too early to recommend the drug to @entity123 ’s patients , but dementia charities last night welcomed the ‘ promising ’ findings as providing ‘ vital new clues ’ about the disease			2
plaque deposits are closely associated with declining memory and other symptoms of @entity123 ’s , so anything that can stop their build - up in the brain is likely to help ward off the condition			0
the research , published in the journal @entity138 , found that a single dose of the antidepressant citalopram lowered production of the plaque protein amyloid beta by 37 per cent			0
the experiment was conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 50 , but the scientists , from the universities of @entity147 and @entity148 , hope the findings can be replicated in elderly patients			0
the drug , marketed in the @entity8 as @entity152 , also had a dramatic effect on elderly mice , halting the growth of existing plaques and reducing the formation of new deposits by 78 per cent .			1

drug was escitalopram , marketed in @entity8 as @entity9 and @entity9 in the @entity10
is an @entity13 , which boosts levels of ' feel good ' chemical serotonin in the brain
was *previously* thought that @entity13 could take weeks to have an effect
but @entity170 researchers noted significant changes in the brain in three hours
