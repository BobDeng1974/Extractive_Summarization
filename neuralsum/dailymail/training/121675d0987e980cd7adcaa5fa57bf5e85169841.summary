@entity16 must take the powerful medication to stop him suffering seizures , with his parents collecting a new dose from @entity10 every week			1
it was only thanks to their familiarity with the repeat prescription that father @entity25 noticed staff had measured out 2.5ml of @entity27 , rather than 0.25ml			1
mr @entity25 , 28 , said that if the little boy , who will turn two in february , had taken the dosage it would have killed him			0
@entity2 was starved of oxygen to the brain , due to a late delivery at @entity34 , @entity35 , and suffered catastrophic brain damage , cerebral palsy and epilepsy			1

' two pharmacists checked the dosage , which was supposed to be 0.25ml , ' said mr @entity25 , of @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45			0
' but they administered 2.5ml and this was also written on the label			0
' if we had n't spotted it and someone else had given that amount to him it would have killed him			0
' after everything we have been through to have this happen is absolutely disgusting			0
' mr @entity25 said he and @entity2 's mother @entity56 , 24 , visit the pharmacy , based at @entity58 , every fortnight to pick up the dose of @entity27			1
he said it was only the family 's familiarity with the medication which helped them spot the glaring mistake			1
mr @entity25 said that had @entity2 been on one of his regular respite breaks with the @entity70 or @entity71 charities to give his parents a break he would have died			2

lifeline : @entity2 must take the powerful medication to stop him suffering seizures , with his parents collecting a new dose from a branch of @entity10 every week ( file picture ) both pharmacists got it wrong			1
' they have made the biggest mistake they could make without actually killing someone , ' said mr @entity25 , who left his job as a recruitment consultant to help look after @entity2 round the clock			2

' we want this to be investigated to make sure it does not happen again			0
' mr @entity25 and former hairdresser ms @entity56 are fighting a legal battle with the @entity35 hospital to try to secure funding for @entity2 's care			2
