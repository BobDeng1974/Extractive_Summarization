by @entity0 a hospital is planning to introduce a high - tech solution to the high demand for its services - by offering consultations via @entity6			1
@entity8 managers claim use of the free online video calling service could reduce outpatient appointments by 35 per cent			1
if the plans at the @entity14 get the go - ahead , it is thought the hospital would become the first in @entity17 to use @entity6 in this way			1
bosses believe using @entity6 will not only ease demand on consultants ’ time , but also free up car parking spaces on the site			2
@entity14 may be @entity17 's first to offer consultations via @entity6 they say up to 180,000 patients a year could also benefit from the online consultations by contacting doctors from their office instead of taking time off work to visit the hospital			1
one hospital in @entity33 already uses @entity6 - but only so nurses can monitor how dialysis patients use their equipment at home			1
the proposal is part of a range of schemes to ease pressure on the hospital , which is coping with higher - than - forecast increases in demand			1
they also include the possibility of doctors treating patients via email consultations			2
typical of cases which could be seen by @entity6 video conference would be people who have had routine surgery or other treatment and simply need a doctor to review final scans before formally discharging them			2
anyone needing face - to face contact and physical examinations will still be called in to the hospital , situated in @entity62 , @entity63			0
officials admit planning for the move is still at an early stage , but it has the potential to slash the annual 517,000 outpatient appointments by 35 per cent			1
chief executive @entity70 said : ‘ some patients take on technology better than others			0
but these methods could suit in particular the under - 50s who now have to take time off work to get to appointments			2
the scheme could see annual outpatient appointments cut by up to 35 per cent ( library image ) ‘ they would see it as a much more sensible way forward to avoid making trips to the hospital			1
’ the move has been welcomed by local health campaigners and business leaders - who said the plans would lessen the impact on the economy of patients taking time off work			2
@entity96 , co-ordinator of pressure group @entity97 , said : ‘ so long as the patient is confident using the system it sounds superb			0
but with vastly growing numbers of silver surfers , it must not be restricted to the young			0
’ @entity103 , deputy chief executive of @entity104 , added : ‘ i think employers would support this as well as their workers			0
‘ for people to spend 10 minutes talking to the doctor while at work instead of having to take the whole day off would help their company ’s productivity			0
’ the £ 400million hospital - built under a private finance initiative - has seen @entity116 admissions soar by 11 per cent over the winter , compared to a forecast growth of just seven per cent			0
it also wants to help gps by setting up ‘ hot clinics ’ where specialists can see patients with already - diagnosed conditions - and then send them straight back to their surgery without needing an admission to a ward			0
a further 50,000 patients - a - year could be seen by consultants running clinics in community settings			0
the scheme could help those in full time work who , rather than struggling to get an appointment , could speak with their doctor over the internet ( library image ) last march , @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity138 said it was considering the introduction of a similar system of video consultations			0
a spokesman yesterday said the proposals were still on the drawing board and had not yet been implemented			0
in 2011 , @entity147 , in @entity148 , @entity33 , introduced @entity6 monitoring of dialysis patients - allowing them to use the machines at home under observation by nurses , who were able to troubleshoot any problems with the aid of the software ’s webcam link			1
the following year , the @entity160 of @entity161 ( @entity162 ) said in advice to doctors that @entity6 could reduce the number of missed gp appointments and pose a better alternative to telephone consultations , as the doctor is also able to visually assess the patient .			1

claimed @entity6 could reduce outpatient appointments by 35 per cent
would therefore ease pressure on many struggling hospitals
180,000 patients could benefit from online consultations , it is thought
if it gets the go - ahead , @entity14 would be first in @entity17 to use service
