by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 12:15 est , 22 november 2013 a group of @entity3 children are forced to study in a rotting shack at the top of a mountain cliff because surrounding towns claim they are all lepers			2
@entity9 died out in @entity10 , southwest @entity3 , decades ago but its neighbours in @entity14 province refuse to believe it			1
despite numerous campaigns to encourage schools to take the pupils , the village is still colloquially dubbed @entity20 , meaning ' leprosy '			2
outlawed : pupils at the @entity10 school in @entity3 are forced to learn in an isolated building on a cliff path outlawed from better - equipped schools , the village 's 13 children , aged five to 15 , climb a treacherous path every morning to get an education			1
the building is shabby , there are only four desks and with gaping holes in the roof , the children get wet when it rains			1
' in summer we bake , in winter we freeze , but we need an education so we must put up with it , ' one boy told a local newspaper			0
school run : the 13 children aged five to 15 have to climb this mountain route to get to class every day perilous : the cave - like hollow in the mountain is the small bit of shelter teacher @entity50 has found for the group to and from class , they have to climb a mountain path with just a rusting rail for support			1
their teacher , @entity57 , 54 , has been there 13 years teaching children the basics of reading , writing , maths and geography			2
locals praise him for his selfless effort to make sure they get an education			0
@entity69 : this is the rusty and flimsy piece of railing they rely on as support to get up the cliff for school desperate : their teacher , @entity57 , has been working here for 13 years but feels sorry for the kids @entity80 - side : their ' classroom ' is a small section of shelter in the middle of a path on the side of a mountain ' learning conditions are difficult and the children are stigmatised for no good reason by the other villages , but they are good kids and they learn fast , even though we do not have much in the way of resources , ' he said			1
' i cherish the time i spend with them and hope they find a decent life for themselves afterwards			0
' they really are dedicated			0
they have to slog up this mountain , sit in a cold and wet room for hours , go back down the mountain and them help their parents with the housework			0
all conditions : ' in summer we bake , in winter we freeze , ' one of the 13 children told a local newspaper a tough education : many children in the village pictured here can not face the daily hike so do not attend school ' they are from very poor families			2
the younger children make dolls from clay because their parents could never afford to buy them dolls from a toy shop			0
' local media reported that some negotiations even ended in fistfights between those who want the children to move and the schools fighting to keep them out			0
' my 13 students in @entity136 finally have the right to equal education , ' said @entity50 .			1

@entity9 died out in @entity136 decades ago but the myth lives on
the 13 pupils aged five - 15 have to climb a mountain to get to school
they have just four *tables* , few resources , and the roof has holes in it
