a wealthy @entity1 bachelor has been posting pictures of himself in his mansion in the hope that his wealth will lure in a lady			2
and if his obvious opulence was n't enough to tempt potential suitors , he has also donned a series of snappy outfits , including a pink dressing gown			0
in a note attached to the photos , the man who calls himself @entity16 , says : ' to all unmarried ones who would like to spend their life by my side and within all the beauties of my home			1
form a line , ladies : @entity1 bachelor @entity16 is hoping his wealth , interior design skills , and impeccable dress sense will find him an ' unmarried one ' to share his life with in a bizarre series of pictures the eligible man is seen sitting in various rooms around his mansion home @entity39 dresser : mr @entity16 is seen wearing everything from dressing gowns to dinner jackets ' please look below at all the magic of my home that i have decorated with taste , perhaps just for you			1
' the bizarre snaps have been circulating on @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity1 websites and have since gone viral			0
in them the grey - haired singleton is seen standing awkwardly in his bathroom , ' relaxing ' on a bed and kneeling in what appears to be a hallway			2
sexy in silk : in one of the more ' relaxed ' pictures mr @entity16 is seen in nothing but silk pyjamas if red really is the colour of love then he will surely have no problem attracting a partner with those shoes wo n't you join me ? in this image @entity72 relaxes in his baby - blue boudoir , presumably awaiting the arrival of his new wife mr @entity16 claims to be 39 - years - old , living in @entity79 and looking for a much younger 16 - 20 - year - old for a relationship and marriage			1
the @entity1 displays a clear love of the finer things in life , with everything from his bed to his bidet finished with gold trim			2
artwork and painted frescoes decorate nearly every wall in his home , including in both of the huge bathrooms			0
dinner for two ? @entity72 is hoping that somebody will join him for a romantic meal before marrying him in this picture @entity16 sits calmly in his slippers , holding a samurai sword , while @entity102 decorations appear to hang in the background @entity104 : after gold plated tables and toilets @entity72 continues his love for the precious metal on this sofa set the privileged man could be making himself out to be wealthier than he is , as several of the shots appear to be on the same room but from different angles			1
here the sofas from the last image are clearly visible ( bottom left ) whoever takes up his offer will have to deal with the cold weather , as temperatures can plummet as low as -5c in winter			0
perhaps the young lady in question could borrow one of @entity72 's fur coats to keep warm in , as he appears to have several			0
either the pictures were taken around @entity102 - time , or mr @entity16 is slow to take his decorations down , as tinsel and baubles feature in the background of several shots			1
in another festive photograph @entity72 is seen outside in front of a snow covered pine tree complete with decorations hotting up : with a quick change into some other , very warm , furs the supposed 39 - year - old is ready for another snap in the study the super-wealthy @entity1 man relaxes in his bathroom ' decorated with taste ' including a gold - plated bidet with this welcoming pose @entity16 is hoping to entice a nubile wife into his home despite appearing on @entity152 websites months ago , it is not known whether or not mr @entity16 ever found his dream nubile bride			1
it is difficult to image how he would have been unable to attract a partner given his dashing looks and dapper dress sense			0
if he has been unsuccessful , he might want to consider adding a profile to one of the many dating sites which cater exclusively to wealthy men seeking younger women , such as @entity164			0
@entity72 's interior design taste even stretches as far as classical architecture , which probably helped to inspire this mosaic floor getting down to business : surrounded by more art and tinsel , the only place @entity72 looks truly at home is behind his desk			2

@entity16 posted pictures online
photographs come with note addressed to all ' unmarried ones '
he offers life of luxury to a 16 - *24* - year - old in return for marriage
the images show his home ' decorated with taste , perhaps just for @entity192 '
