a lesbian couple is fighting their sperm donor for full custody of their son after a judge accepted his bid to visit the child			1
the case could redefine reproductive rights for same - sex couples in @entity12			2
@entity13 and @entity14 of @entity15 , @entity12 , claim @entity16 , of @entity17 , signed a contract they drew up , agreeing to relinquish his legal paternity over the boy born in 2013			1
the child was conceived via at - home artificial insemination - a practice much cheaper than clinic procedures but not recognized under the law			1
in september , @entity16 requested to see the boy at weekends , while paying $ 83 a week in child support , and his appeal was granted			2
distraught : @entity13 and @entity14 ( pictured at their 2011 civil union ) have been hit with parental appeals from both of their two sperm donors			1
they are fighting the second , whose son was born after they married ' emotionally it 's very hard for us , ' @entity40 told @entity43			2
' all we want is a family , and we ca n't have kids without an outside party			0
it 's a lot for us to have to deal with			0
it 's not just hard on us , it 's hard on the kids , too			0
' the @entity51 have had two children conceived via at - home artificial insemination , using the sperm of two donors			1
but last year , both men filed for visitation with their children			0
the first , father to the @entity62 's toddler , was granted parental time , which the couple accepted as they were not married at the time of his birth			0
however , they are now fighting back against @entity16 , whose one - year - old son was born after they entered into a civil union			1
sons : they have had two boys via at - home artificial insemination			1
the younger ( right ) now sees his legal father @entity16 for a few hours each weekend			0
@entity16 also pays $ 83 a week in child support to the @entity81 he can now see the child a few hours each weekend , while paying $ 83 a week in child support			2
the rulings came despite the fact that the @entity81 drew up contracts for the men , agreeing that they would relinquish their legal paternity			0
the women opted for at - home procedures to avoid the $ 1,000 fee at a clinic			1
but under the law , sperm donors retain their rights if the artificial insemination is done outside of a physician 's office			1
disputes surrounding at - home insemination are treated as standard custody battles			2
@entity104 , the @entity105 - based attorney representing the @entity81 , slammed the distinction as a significant obstacle for same - sex couples			2
he also argues that the fact the women visited a physician for advice should act in their favor			0
' we do n't think this is an @entity116 decision , ' @entity104 told @entity43			0
' but we do think it disparately impacts @entity117 couples , and disproportionately impacts lower - income people			0
' the @entity51 hope that the fact of their marriage will strengthen their case that they are a strong united family who deserve full custody			0
they entered into a civil union in 2011 , and in 2014 , a few months after their second son was born , they got married .			1
