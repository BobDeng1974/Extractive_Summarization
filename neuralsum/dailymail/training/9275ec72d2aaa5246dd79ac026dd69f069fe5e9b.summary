by @entity1 reporter published : 20:06 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 : 11:21 est , 28 february 2014 a @entity5 court has ruled that drivers can legally read maps on their cell phones while behind the wheel without being penalized for driving while on their mobile devices			1
the 5th @entity11 reversed the case of a @entity14 man who was ticketed in january 2012 for looking at a map on his @entity16 while stuck in traffic			1
the driver , @entity18 , challenged the $ 165 fine because he did not feel it was right that he had to pay after using his phone while his car was not moving due to roadwork			1
approved : a @entity5 court ruled that even though the state requires hands free devices to be used while driving , drivers should not be ticketed for using their phone for directions he had grabbed his cellphone to find an alternate route when a @entity35 officer on a motorcycle spotted him and wrote the ticket			1
mr @entity18 first challenged the case in traffic court , where he lost , and then appealed it himself to a three - judge panel in @entity41 , where he lost a second time			0
mr @entity18 knows the dangers of texting while driving as his son suffered a broken leg from a driver who was chatting on a cellphone			2
as a result , he always uses a hands - free device to talk and drive			0
determined that the hands free law did n't apply to him in this case , mr @entity18 took it to the appellate court			1
in their 18 - page ruling , the appellate judges said @entity5 's law that prohibits people from talking on their cellphones without a hands - free device could have been written more clearly , but it does n't apply to looking at maps on cellphones			1
the law the @entity35 officer used to ticket mr @entity18 applies specifically to people ' listening and talking ' on cellphones , not using their mobile phone in other ways , the court said			2
archaic : car gps systems have become common but many drivers still use their phones for directions , which the court ruled was fine because the driver in question was not moving at the time texting while driving remains illegal under another @entity5 law passed after the one at issue in mr @entity18 ' case			1
attorney @entity84 , who represented @entity18 , said it 's now up to the state attorney general 's office to decide if it will challenge thursday 's ruling to the @entity5 @entity89 , which is choosy about which cases it hears			2
@entity92 , a spokesman for attorney general @entity93 , said the office is reviewing the ruling			0
neither @entity84 nor mr @entity92 were familiar with other states that prohibit drivers from looking at cellphone map applications			0
mr @entity18 , who is entitled to recoup his $ 165 fine , said the @entity41 judges who had upheld his violation were guilty of overreaching by applying the spotty law to him			0
he hopes that @entity5 legislators will now revisit the issue and fix it			0
' they 're going to have to do something , ' mr @entity18 said			0
' i just hope they take a look at the big picture			0

a @entity14 court ruled that a driver who was ticketed for using his phone 's map function while *stopped* due to roadwork should be reimbursed
@entity119 said that the state 's *ban* against talking on cell phones does n't apply to people looking at the map tool
texting while driving is still *ban*ned in the state
