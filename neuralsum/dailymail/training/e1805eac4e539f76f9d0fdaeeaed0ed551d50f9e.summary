arriving at the @entity2 and @entity3 two weeks ago for my long - awaited appointment , my mind was already on the pleasures i had planned for the next day			1
this meeting with a gynaecologist had been in the diary for three months , so it was hardly urgent , and i had no reason to doubt i would be in good spirits for my son ’s 22nd birthday celebrations 24 hours later			1
little did i know that within half an hour i would be emerging from the consultant ’s office in a state of shock , having been through one of the most physically traumatic experiences of my life			1
the procedure reduced me to a screaming , sobbing , quivering wreck and left me so wiped out i could barely get out of bed for five days			1
it ’s been a life - changing experience , leaving me feeling deeply vulnerable , and when i think back to the woman who ’d sat calmly in the waiting room , it is as if she were a different person — someone who naively thought doctors would always act in her best interests			1
@entity22 was due to celebrate her son @entity42 's 22nd birthday the day after the appointment but was left bedridden for five days after the traumatising experience the condition which had led me there was unpleasant — heavy bleeding caused by fibroids in my womb — but certainly not life - threatening			1
for women of my age ( i am 58 ) , this situation could almost be described as routine			1
and when the doctor summoned me into her office with a broad smile i was once again reassured			1
‘ we ’re just going to do a quick internal examination and you ’ll be on your way , ’ she told me			1
then she paused and added : ‘ actually , while you ’re here we should probably take a biopsy [ to rule out cancer ]			1
it will be a little bit uncomfortable , but there should n’t be any pain			1
is that ok ? ’ eager to help , i nodded , smiling			1
the first alarm bell rang when the nurse patted my shoulder and said : ‘ are n’t you brave ? some women ca n’t manage to have this done , so good for you			1
’ puzzled , i decided the best policy was to keep smiling			1
but within five seconds of the procedure starting , a searing pain tore through my body			2
what ensued was a procedure known as an endometrial biopsy , in which the lining of the uterus is cut and scraped away			2
the procedure itself is common , especially among menopausal women			2
i had been through something similar in the past , but for one crucial detail : in this instance , i was given no anaesthetic whatsoever			2
most of these procedures are done under general anaesthetic , with patients leaving hospital the same day			2
some patients prefer to have an epidural , meaning they feel nothing from the waist down , but these are more complicated for the anaesthetist and generally take longer to recover from			2
@entity22 , pictured in 2011 , was in so much pain during the procedure that she likened the experience to childbirth , judging her pain at a 9 on a 1 - 10 scale perhaps the quickest and cheapest option is to forego the anaesthetic altogether			1
and this is what happened to me			1
it was a brutal experience			2
on a scale of one to ten , with ten being the pain of childbirth , i would rate it as a nine			2
as the doctor took the biopsy , which involves cutting away part of the uterus lining , then scraped right into my uterus and ovaries ( a procedure designed to reduce heavy bleeding ) , i was exploding in pain			2
all the while the nurse was whispering in my ear : ‘ you ’re doing well			2
breathe deeply , it ’s almost done			2
’ @entity22 , pictured here with former husband and film director @entity130			1
@entity22 says she felt ' deceived and violated ' after her experience in the consultant 's office only it was far from over			1
for a quarter of an hour i screamed , bawled and panted like a woman in labour			2
the experience was so similar , i pointed out to the nurse that precisely 22 years earlier i had been in labour with my son , @entity42			2
‘ well , it ’s not as bad as that , is it ? ’ she said , still smiling			2
in moments of extreme pain , time seems to stand still			2
a minute can seem like an hour			2
then , just as i felt the agony would never end , the nurse said : ‘ all done			2
i think you ’ve earned a cup of coffee and a slice of cake			0
’ @entity156 , i left the room in a state of shock			1
somehow i got home and fell into bed , spent			0
@entity22 was treated at the @entity2 and @entity163 hospital ( pictured ) , but was not admitted for the procedure , she was treated as an outpatient for five days i was exhausted			1
my son ’s birthday was a washout			0
instead of being treated by me to a day out , he was to spend the next week looking after me			0
as the days passed , as the shock retreated , anger took its place			1
why had it happened ? what on earth would possess any clinician to put a patient through that sort of experience ? exactly why had n’t i been offered any anaesthetic ? i felt deceived and violated			1
not only was it painful , it was brutally intimate			0
normally a woman will be unconscious or anaesthetised to the point where she is blissfully unaware of the procedure			0
yet i had felt every scrape and cut			0
to me , it seemed that the doctor and nurse — quite a double act with their breezy compliments — had blatantly groomed me			0
i had n’t even been asked to sign a consent form for the procedure			0
was i ‘ brave ’ , to repeat their mantra ? not particularly			0
stupid would be a more apt description , to fall for this con trick which persuaded me not to make a fuss			0
@entity22 , pictured last week , has said that given the horrific experience she had , she will be looking to get private health insurance in the future to prevent repeat experiences during the five days of bed rest that followed , i had plenty of time to reflect on the reasons for my horrendous experience			1
i also learned i am not alone			0
my best friend ’s daughter recently had a similar experience during a procedure in which dye was passed through her fallopian tubes			0
again , she suffered excruciating pain , and again the subject of an anaesthetic never even came up			0
i also discovered that one woman who had an excruciating experience during a similar procedure to mine had taken the matter up with her mp , @entity223 , who raised the issue in the @entity225			0
the mp said she ’d been contacted by other women , all with horrifying stories			0
but why would any doctor put a woman through this ? it is hard to escape the conclusion that it is related to spending cutbacks			0
@entity22 , pictured here with former husband and son , @entity42			1
@entity22 was unable to work for a week after the procedure and says she has ' lost faith ' in the @entity240 since it happened lying in bed , my mind wandered back to the nurse telling me so sweetly : ‘ most women are n’t able to do this			1
’ presumably they pulled the plug on the procedure from the first agonising scrape			0
why did n’t i ? because , perversely , i just wanted it to be over			0
the appointment had been in the diary for three months and having come this far there seemed little logic in turning back			0
again and again i was told the procedure was ‘ almost done ’ , only for it to go on for another ten minutes			0
in hindsight , i would have waited another year to have it done under anaesthetic , rather than endure that visceral pain			0
@entity22 ( pictured ) says she was n't even asked to sign a consent form before the procedure yet from the doctor ’s perspective , this barbaric approach makes sense			1
the @entity240 is stretched to breaking point			0
if they can get away with treating me in half an hour , rather than booking out a hospital bed for an entire day and calling in the anaesthetist , then why not do it ? while it ’s not clear whether this policy is directly affecting pain relief provision in hospitals , the government has pledged to financially reward those that increase the number of procedures done as an outpatient without a general anaesthetic — including hysteroscopies			0
i called my gp to seek advice			1
he was shocked at what had happened , advising me that it is a fundamental principle of medicine that the doctor should have stopped the moment i showed signs of being in severe distress			1
that they did not amounts to malpractice , and i am giving serious consideration to my options			0
i do not want to sue the @entity240 for money — the last thing the system needs is another drain on its finances			0
yet i am determined this should not be allowed to continue			0
no matter what pressure doctors are under , they should not be allowed to hurt people like this			0
much as i love the @entity240 , i am certain this never would have happened to me had i been a private patient			1
because of this debacle i was unable to work for a week			0
next month my latest acting project , opposite sir @entity311 in the @entity313 adaptation of @entity314 , will be aired and i am as busy as ever			0
taking time off is not an option			0
and if this experience has taught me one thing it is that i need to get myself some private health insurance , and fast			1
the hard - working people of the @entity240 may be doing their level best but i , for one , have lost faith			0
a spokesman for the @entity2 and @entity3 said : ‘ we want to provide the best quality care and patient experience possible and apologise for the fact @entity22 feels we did not meet this			1
‘ we always try to avoid unnecessary surgery for every patient , as surgery carries risk			0
obtaining an endometrial sample always takes place in the outpatient setting as part of the routine gynaecological consultation			1

@entity22 was due to have a routine examination for uterine fibroids
what actually happened left her bedridden for five days
@entity22 's gp was shocked when she relayed the story afterwards
she says she will now be looking to get private health insurance to stop anything like this happening again
