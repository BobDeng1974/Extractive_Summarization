the job description for the next @entity2 chief executive surprisingly puts as the major priority winning the @entity4 in 2022 and 2023			1
this aim , detailed in the first paragraph of the recruitment advertisement , elevates women ’s football , which has its flagship tournament a year after the men , to unprecedented heights			2
it comes at a time when the women ’s game is the fastest - growing team sport in the @entity17			0
the @entity19 crowd for last month ’s @entity21 v @entity23 women ’s game — 55,000 — far surpassed the attendance of 40,181 when @entity26 ’s side played @entity27 in september			0
@entity2 chairman @entity28 is behind the focus on women 's football , according to an @entity2 spokesman but such belated gender parity at the @entity2 comes after it took their board 148 years to appoint their first female board member			1
it is also puzzling the @entity2 nominations panel should put such emphasis on @entity39 when @entity40 2020 , with semi-finals and finals at @entity19 , is widely regarded as @entity21 ’s best opportunity to win a major tournament			1
an @entity2 spokesman said the stated ambitions reflect those of @entity2 chairman @entity28 and the huge growth in women ’s football			2
the nine - month battle between @entity51 and @entity52 for the @entity54 presidency began at the @entity55 in @entity56 , with @entity52 saying : ‘ i do all my work only in athletics			1
’ this was a clear dig at @entity51 ’s varied roles , but @entity52 ’s strong anti-drugs offensive has come late in his career while @entity51 has been campaigning on that subject since the 1980s			1
meanwhile , a notable face on @entity51 ’s team is the respected @entity67 , director of @entity55 relations at the @entity69 who was @entity21 chef de mission at the @entity71			2
the nine - month battle between @entity51 and @entity52 for the @entity54 presidency began in @entity56 @entity73 president @entity72 will not stand in the way of the ethics committee investigating the @entity77 doping scandal that has embroiled his son @entity78			1
diack junior was exposed in a @entity82 tv documentary as having links with @entity85 based company @entity84 that was used as a slush fund to cover up payments to ensure serial positive drugs tests in @entity77 were not reported			0
@entity78 told @entity82 broadcasters ard that he was involved commercially with the @entity91 controller of @entity84			0
@entity54 vice-president @entity51 said : ‘ @entity72 will wait for the investigation and if names are in the fray then clearly those names are going to be subject of that investigation			1
@entity72 ’s not curtailing the work of the ethics committee			0
’ @entity99 , who no longer has a management team advising him , should have been told that staying for only 20 minutes at the autosport awards evening partly sponsored by the world champion ’s @entity103 outfit was a @entity106 own goal			1
former team - mate @entity107 received a far more rapturous reception than @entity99 at the @entity109			2
formula one world champion @entity99 left the autosport awards after only 20 minutes swimming , athletics and shooting are in danger of losing disciplines at @entity118 ’s @entity117 to make way for host city flexibility that might see the addition of baseball , softball , squash and karate			1
however , the suggestion of @entity127 , @entity129 ’s @entity128 representative , that the triple jump and race walking were under threat did n’t impress @entity51 , who described the former as ‘ sacrosanct ’ and race walking as being hugely popular in parts of the world the 40 @entity55 recommendations rubber - stamped at the @entity138 were a triumph for new president @entity140 , who ensured all consultation and approval for the reforms were in place before the unanimous support he received on monday			2
the way the @entity128 go about their business is the polar opposite of @entity150			0
ironically , @entity150 president and @entity128 member @entity151 did not oppose the age limits introduced			0
@entity151 said : ‘ i am a team player with the @entity128 , but @entity150 is a different team			0
’ @entity127 suggested that the triple jump and race walking were under threat at the @entity117 the @entity157 tv rights auction is not expected to be delayed by the @entity159 inquiry into @entity161 ’s complaint about the selling process			0
but any postponement might suit the @entity157 with talk of gigantic mergers between @entity166 and @entity167 as well as @entity168 and @entity169 that would greatly add to the billion - pound bidding war chests .			0

the @entity2 have *released* their job description for the chief executive post
@entity51 and @entity52 have been trading blows over @entity54 presidency
