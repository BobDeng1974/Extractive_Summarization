@entity0 prompted a row last night after issuing a provocative call for the @entity3			2
the deputy prime minister said that while he agreed with @entity5 that @entity7 was ‘ infused by christian values ’ , he believed the @entity8 should be disestablished			1
his remarks are particularly sensitive since he is the chairman of the @entity10 , the formal body of advisers to the @entity13			0
he proposed the @entity13 should be stripped of the title ' @entity17 ' ‘ in the long run it would be better for the @entity8 and better for people of faith , and better for @entity23 , if the @entity8 and the state were to stand on their own two separate feet , ’ mr @entity0 told @entity18			2
his proposal would mean the @entity26 being removed as the head of the @entity8 , as they have been since 1534			2
the @entity13 holds the title of @entity17 and @entity29			0
the prime minister immediately rejected his deputy ’s suggestion , insisting : ‘ no i do n’t want to see that , i think our arrangements work well in this country			1
‘ as i ’ve said before , we ’re a @entity39 country , we have an established church , and being a @entity39 country , i find other faith leaders and members of other faiths say that it makes us almost more understanding , more tolerant , more understanding of the role that faith and religion plays in our country			1
‘ and actually , faith organisations do an enormous amount in terms of supporting schools , supporting charities , helping to build what i call the bigger society			0
‘ so i do n’t want to see what the deputy prime minister has set out , it ’s a long - term liberal idea but not a @entity62 one			1
’ the deputy prime minister made his proposal despite admitting that @entity7 is ' infused by christian values ' the archbishop of @entity66 yesterday backed mr @entity5 in a row with militant atheists over his @entity70 message insisting @entity7 should be more ‘ confident ’ and ‘ evangelical ’ about its status as a @entity39 country			1
the archbishop said it was a ‘ historical fact ’ , whether people liked it or not , that @entity7 society and culture - from art and music to the health service and school system - was ‘ earthed ’ in @entity39			1
he dismissed a warning from more than 50 public figures , organised by the @entity86 , that mr @entity5 risked sowing ‘ alienation and division ’ in society by championing christian values			2
the @entity92 , writing on his personal blog , admitted that proof of the importance of @entity39 to the @entity7 could not be found in attendance numbers at church , which have continued to fall			2
but he said the response to the prime minister ’s assertion that @entity7 was a @entity39 country had been ‘ all quite baffling ’ but also ‘ encouraging ’ , since @entity39 thrived amid ‘ hatred and opposition ’ rather than ‘ comfortable indifference ’			1
a group led by the @entity86 , and including writers @entity104 and sir @entity106 and @entity108 columnist @entity107 , accused mr @entity5 of causing harm by emphasising @entity39			0
the prime minister flatly rejected @entity0 's suggestion as @entity112 defended the historical connection the @entity92 insisted who signed the humanist letter were ‘ wrong ’ to suggest that being proud of @entity7 ’s ‘ christian identity ’ excluded others			1
‘ judging by the reaction , anyone would think that the people concerned had at the same time suggested the return of the @entity123 ( complete with comfy chairs for @entity126 fans ) , compulsory church going and universal tithes , ’ he said			0
communities secretary @entity129 said he had been shocked by the backlash from atheists to his recent ruling that councils should be allowed to hold prayers before the start of meetings			0
he said : ‘ i am a @entity39 , but my little intervention was basically just to say “ let ’s allow people to have a prayer before a council meeting ”			0
i would have been equally angry if people were forced to go to the prayer			0
‘ all i wanted to do was allow people , but on that basis the entire heavens have opened up - you would have thought i was some kind of ayatollah demanding people go to church when i was just trying to be a voice for moderation and reasonableness			0

@entity0 said ' @entity7 infused by christian values ' but called for change
would be first time since @entity159 cut off @entity160 in 1534
prime minister flatly rejected proposal , said ' we *'re* a @entity39 country '
