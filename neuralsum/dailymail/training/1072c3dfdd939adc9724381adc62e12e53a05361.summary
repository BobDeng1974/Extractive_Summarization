some feared @entity1 would be scuppered by the ‘ curse of @entity3 ’ – but it may have been lucky number seven that sent him into seventh heaven			1
for superstitious tennis fans were quick to observe that his victory in the men ’s final at @entity11 came 77 years after a @entity12 last secured the title , with @entity15 ’s success in 1936			2
yesterday was of course the seventh day of the seventh month			0
those who pooh - pooh the concept of the lucky number might be swayed by the fact that while @entity1 and @entity28 are both 26 , our @entity35 hero was born seven days before yesterday ’s loser			2
and surely only hardened cynics would ignore the fact that @entity41 ’s last singles title winner , @entity42 , had her moment of glory in 1977			2
belief that seven is a lucky number goes back centuries – while the ‘ curse of @entity3 ’ had only gained credence in recent months			1
@entity3 blows out his cheeks as the tension mounts ... but is soon gripped again phew : he wipes away away a tear as mother @entity53 looks on the prime minister had been accused of being a bad omen after his hopes of victory heralded failure for sports stars including female tennis player @entity60 , cyclist @entity61 and diver @entity62			1
he sent his best wishes to @entity41 number one @entity60 , 19 , shortly before her fourth - round exit last week			1
but mr @entity3 defied those begging him to stay away from this year ’s final by sitting in the @entity68 at @entity69 and clapping enthusiastically at every point @entity1 won			0
before the match mr @entity3 said : ‘ i think the whole country has been incredibly impressed , not just with his skill but with his courage and his mental courage in coming through to the final yet again			0
‘ the whole country is right behind you @entity1 – go for it			0
’ @entity1 had defended mr @entity3 ’s good luck messages and seemed unperturbed by the ‘ @entity81 being present .			0

@entity24 's jinx may have been *lifted* by the *mystical* power of the number seven
there were fears @entity3 's well - wishing was *hexing* @entity41 tennis players
but *historic* victory appears to have *vindicated* @entity3 's support
