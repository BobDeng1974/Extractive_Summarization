by @entity0 @entity2 pilot @entity1 , 22 , told in his diary how @entity5 pilots helped the @entity6 in @entity7 @entity6 and @entity5 airmen went to astonishing lengths to help each other in the @entity7 , warning each other where they were about to drop bombs and sending photographs of graves when they buried the other side 's dead			1
the extraordinary level of cooperation has been uncovered during research for an exhibition commemorating the conflict ’s outbreak			0
diaries kept by a young pilot from @entity26 reveal how camaraderie sometimes took precedence over hostilities , particularly amongst @entity6 and @entity5 pilots			1
notes taken by @entity2 pilot @entity32 , 22 , suggest @entity5 pilots warned their @entity6 enemies of where they were planning to drop bombs			1
posted to @entity37 near @entity38 in 1916 , mr @entity1 's diaries tell of almost daily bombing raids on @entity5 - held aerodromes , as well as the docks , and @entity42 sheds at @entity43 and @entity44			1
one day in may 1916 , according to his diary , one of their number failed to return from a raid on @entity50 aerodrome , and there were rumours that the missing aircraft had been picked up from the sea by a @entity56 trawler			2
a few days later , with still no news of the missing man , one of mr @entity1 ’s colleagues flew over the @entity5 airfield and dropped a message asking if they had information about his fate			1
the @entity6 pilots received a prompt reply , also dropped from the air , confirming that the aircraft had indeed been shot down over the sea			1
@entity1 wrote in his diary : ' they said attempts had been made at rescue , but when the machine was brought in , the pilot was already dead			1
' he was buried with full military honours alongside two comrades at @entity77 cemetery , @entity50			0
the message was accompanied by two photos of the funeral and the grave			0
' the diary went on : ' there was also a message in @entity5 stating the name and place in @entity5 territory where our machines could land if they had engine trouble			1
' @entity91 , head of photographs at the @entity93 , said such cooperation was much more common among pilots than among those fighting the war on the ground			1
he said : ' i know of cases where @entity5 pilots dropped notes and photographs of a crashed aircraft and its occupant , saying they ’d buried him and asking for his name so they could make a headstone , ' he said			2
' in one instance , a @entity5 pilot dropped a note saying he was about to bomb an airfield and suggesting that those on the ground should get out of the way '			1
but he said the tip - off giving details of a safe landing place was probably no more than a @entity5 joke			2
mr @entity1 flew a @entity122 plane like this - such planes shot down more than 1,200 enemy aircraft in @entity7 mr @entity91 said : ' i think it ’s more likely to have been an example of @entity5 humour - they would n’t have expected the @entity6 to take them up on it			1
' mr @entity1 was awarded the @entity131 for gallantry in the air in 1917			1
towards the end of the war , he went on to become one of the first pilots to engage in ‘ deck flying ’ , taking off in @entity139 and @entity140 from short platforms built on gun turrets on what were to be the forerunners of aircraft carriers			2
he survived his time in @entity147 and , after a career working in the public health department of @entity150 , he returned to @entity26 to live with his sister in @entity152 , @entity153			2
his nephew , @entity154 , still lives in the same house and has kept his diaries and logbooks safe			0
' he was a lovely man ' said mr @entity154			0
' but he never spoke to us about his war record			0
' at the outbreak of hostilities , warring nations had limited air forces which flew slow and unarmed reconnaissance planes into enemy territory			0
but aerial warfare was quickly developed by both sides , initially with bombs being dropped by hand and pistols being used on occasions			0
machines guns were mounted to the front of planes as well as being fitted to observers ’ platforms on two - seaters and intense battles commenced			0
the @entity5 air force pioneered the use of ‘ flying wings ’ – large numbers of aircraft patrolling into enemy territory together			0
legendary @entity5 fighter ace @entity185 , aka the @entity185 , flew this @entity186 @entity185 , the celebrated ace known as the @entity185 because of the colour of his fokker triplane , led such ‘ flying circuses ’ and became a hero among @entity5 soldiers			0
in @entity6 , the @entity192 , which was the @entity194 ’s flying service and the @entity2 were amalgamated in 1918 to form the @entity195			2
by this stage of the war , advanced planes such as @entity197 were flying as high as 18,000ft achieving speeds of 123mph			0
in october 1918 , the heaviest bomb of the war was dropped by a @entity203 at 1,650lb , an unthinkable weight at the beginning			2
right up until the end of the war , the various nations ’ air forces were evenly matched , suffering similar numbers of losses .			0
