it is the question that , among so many in the tumble of allegation and revelation , just keeps on getting asked			0
how did she ever get so close ? how did she get close enough to take classified military documents home as she has now admitted to doing ? so close that she felt somehow entitled to send harassing emails to @entity8 , telling the @entity10 socialite to ' back off ' the man she clearly considered hers			1
even before @entity14 's affair with general @entity15 emerged it was a point which bothered talk - show hosts , perplexed interviewers and left onlookers faintly bewildered at the string of appearances which constituted @entity14 's publicity tour for that book , @entity24			1
' i 'm gon na go for it ' , @entity14 's email to gen @entity15 led to the biography published in january and described by one critic as ' a @entity30 ' to the 4 star general a study in strategy : @entity14 stroked her subject 's ego with one hand and shored up her credentials with the other her own explanation , such as it was , is glib at best			1
they met , she repeatedly trotted out , at a dinner for @entity43 alumni back in 2006			0
after dinner there were drinks and at drinks he gave her his business card and they just kept in touch			0
two years later , in 2008 , she was working on a dissertation on theories of leadership and so , she told @entity54 , ' i shot him an email , and said , " i 'm gon na to go for it			0
" ' @entity15 's reaction was to invite her well and truly into his camp - a decision he rues today			1
he has told his friend colonel @entity61 that he considers his actions , ' morally reprehensible ' , though , interestingly could not resist a flick of self - defence , pointing out that he had ' violated no laws '			1
broadwell promoting her book on the now infamous @entity54 interview			0
' the real controversy , ' he quipped , ' is , is he awesome or incredibly awesome ? ' he says he is ignoring the media storm and on friday will testify before a @entity70 on the @entity72 consulate attack			2
he will do so behind closed doors			1
still , the inescapable fact remains , that for a man of such experience the extent to which he let his guard down with @entity14 is breathtaking			2
but then @entity14 is nothing if not convincing when it comes to outlining her own credentials and , given the glowing portrait of ' strategic leadership ' she penned as @entity15 's biography , nothing if not flattering			1
part @entity86 , part @entity89 : @entity14 was , ' an acolyte ' never a reporter and an unquestioning devotee of the gen @entity15 in one television interview she recalled approaching @entity15 and asking him to be a case - study for her dissertation			1
she wanted to show , ' what @entity15 's role was in forcing the military to adapt to win the wars we were in '			1
' there was no room for a conversation of shortcomings of the @entity15 theology			2
she was n't a reporter			0
she struck me as an acolyte , ' one advisor to @entity15 is quoted as telling the @entity110			2
and while @entity14 stroked her subject 's ego with one hand she shored up her own credibility with the other ; part @entity116 , part blue - stocking			2
another in the @entity15 camp noted , on meeting her , ' i was underwhelmed			2
it was surprising to me that she was his official biographer			0
' but , when it came to promoting her book , for @entity14 establishing her own academic , military and security credentials came second only to establishing whether @entity15 was , as @entity54 put it , ' awesome or incredibly awesome '			1
she dropped academic qualifications and security clearance the way a socialite might pepper her conversation with boasts of parties attended and ' bffs ' made			1
according to @entity14 , being embedded in @entity134 with @entity15 was not the huge leap many imagined because , she explained , ' we had previously met through academia ’			1
she herself was a graduate of @entity43 and a specialist in counter-terrorism with black ops experience , high security clearance , ' and then some '			1
how the suspension of that much vaunted government clearance must smart			1
homecoming queen 1991 , pictured here with her @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 star ... @entity14 never tires of listing her many achievements			2
she was @entity149 , all state basketball player , top of her class at @entity43 , holder of a masters from @entity157 ... and how do we know all of this ? because @entity14 has taken great pains to tell us			2
we know that her husband @entity161 is not ' just ' a radiologist but an ' interventional radiologist '			0
@entity14 and her husband , @entity165 , just days before the scandal broke			0
he is not , she relentlessly stresses , just a radiologist but an ' interventionalist radiologist ' gen @entity15 and his wife , @entity169 , at the @entity170			0
she had ' lots of good things to say , ' on reading @entity14 's biography of her husband writing in @entity179 , @entity178 states , ' when my friend met her , she was fond of pointing out that her husband was no mere radiologist but a special breed known as as " interventional radiologist			2
" she would draw out the word " interventional " for emphasis			0
' we know that she can run six - minute miles and do hundreds of press - ups , that she has 13 per cent body fat and is an ironman triathlete and marathon runner			0
we know all this because she has told us			0
we know that she hosted a charity bbq for wounded veterans because she invited @entity54 and the assembled press			0
ferocious self - promoter : @entity14 managed to persuade @entity54 to attend a fundraising bbq for wounded veterans in @entity195 , @entity196 meanwhile , until she stopped posting , her @entity198 feed was a dizzying mixture of her following both world - causes and the world - famous			0
according to the @entity202 she recently tweeted , ' heading 2 @ @entity203 the @entity204 tomorrow ! panel ( media & terrorism ) followed by a 1v1 run with @entity208 '			0
the political , professional and academic platform on which she now teeters is one entirely of her own , formidable , construction : itself an exercise in strategy to rival @entity15 's own			2
with breathtaking arrogance , @entity14 let it be known that @entity15 referred to her as , ' his @entity214 ' she has set out her credentials relentlessly with faux humility , referring to herself as a mere ' mentee ' of @entity15 on one hand then telling the @entity221 in her hometown in @entity196 , ‘ @entity15 once joked i was his @entity215 ’ a breathtakingly arrogant aside			1
@entity224 once noted that if you had to tell people you were a lady , you probably were n't			0
but self - effacement seems the only class that @entity14 ever sat out			0
and the more impressive @entity14 made herself the more flattering her interest in @entity15 must surely have been			1
what better way to appeal to a man in power than to appeal to his vanity ? a man of ' overachieving impulses and intellectual pretensions : ' the vanities to which @entity14 appealed @entity178 describes @entity15 as a man of ' overachieving impulses and intellectual pretensions '			1
recognising that , @entity14 seems to have taken those dubious attributes as her own template for what she described in several publicity interviews as her ' new path of the soldier - scholar '			0
as such she has been a keen writer of opinion pieces and regular poster on the @entity43 alumni notes page			0
writing in the @entity251 in 2009 she tackled the issue of fraternisation between the sexes on the front line , ' human sexuality will always present a challenge to organisational discipline			0
in isolated outposts [ it ] could create a situation where issues of sex impede an organization 's survival skills '			1
rather presciently she concluded , ' @entity266 sex is futile and impossible ; the best approach is to set rules regarding fraternization , maintain awareness of relationships within the command , and strictly and fairly discipline transgressors			2
' on many occasions @entity14 has noted of @entity15 that he , ' spoke truth to power '			1
but if the events of the past week have shown anything it is that the court of the man known as ' @entity282 , ' lacked anyone willing or able to do the same to him			0
because where @entity15 ' spoke truth to power ' @entity14 wanted to dissect that power and to get close to it			1
revealingly , in a recent address to the @entity290 she claimed to have been drawn to the military as an ' instrument of power ' and that she wanted to understand how that instrument worked - presumably so she could play it .			1

an acolyte never a reporter she appealed to the pretensions of a vain man
she saw the military as an ' instrument of power ' that she wanted to dissect and understand
she claimed that sex can ' impede an organisation 's survival ' but said that banning it was ' futile and impossible '
@entity15 will testify on @entity72 behind closed doors ; he says the affair was ' morally reprehensible '
@entity14 admits to taking classified military documents to her home and has her much vaunted government security clearance suspended
