@entity1 demands : @entity2 has listed six criteria the government needs to fulfill for @entity5 to support military action a divided @entity5 yesterday issued a tortured statement on @entity8 , claiming @entity9 had failed to produce ‘ compelling evidence ’ showing the @entity12 regime had deployed chemical weapons			1
throwing the government ’s plans for a vote on imminent missile attacks into chaos , @entity2 ’s party did not come out and oppose intervention , but claimed any action would have to meet six gruelling criteria which could take weeks to fulfil			1
an amendment released last night by @entity5 fell well short of the government ’s conviction that dictator @entity12 had used poison gas on his own people - simply condemning his ‘ killing of hundreds of civilians ’			1
a day after mr @entity2 said he would consider backing a ‘ limited ’ use of force , the party changed its position by saying they would not agree until they saw ‘ compelling evidence ’ chemical weapons were used by @entity12 ’s forces			1
they said they needed to see a full report by the @entity42 weapons inspectors and for this report to be voted on by the @entity44			2
they further demand a ‘ clear basis in international law ’ for involvement and a vote in parliament on action , which they insisted had to be ‘ legal , proportionate , time - limited and have precise and achievable objectives designed to deter the future use of prohibited chemical weapons			1
’ these demands were then echoed in the @entity25 motion which was released last night ahead of today ’s vote			2
mr @entity2 who was briefed on the military intelligence from @entity8 in @entity60 on tuesday , backtracked amid growing turmoil within his party over the prospect intervention in the civil war - ravaged country and accusations it could drag @entity68 into an @entity70 - style quagmire			2
a senior @entity5 source summed up the party ’s position as : ‘ we have essentially reached a decision that we can not give the prime minister a blank cheque tomorrow ’			2
testing : @entity42 chemical weapons experts wearing gas masks carry samples collected from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in @entity83 yesterday live tweeting : @entity84 tweeted a picture showing prime minister @entity9 chairing a @entity86 across the road : as @entity25 discussed actions , a protest calling for no military attack took place on the other side of the road a member of the shadow cabinet accused mr @entity2 of having ‘ slammed into reverse gear ’ after being told he was moving too quickly			1
one member of his frontbench , public health minister @entity99 , said she would consider resigning over if forced to support an intervention that was not ‘ legal ’			0
miss @entity99 , who voted against the @entity101 , broke ranks yesterday to say : ‘ at the moment , i ca n’t see anything that would make me vote for intervention in @entity8			0
’ anti-action : @entity99 called @entity8 a complex civil war in an outspoken interview she argued against @entity68 being ‘ stampeded into action , warning against ‘ delivering military punishment beatings ’ and said there was no reason to believe military strikes would be legal , or would do anything to ‘ stop @entity12 fighting to the last @entity8			0
’ ‘ essentially it ’s a civil war ’ , she said			0
‘ what @entity116 and @entity117 have taught us is that these situations in the @entity121 are complex			0
it ’s not good guys in white hats and bad guys in black hats ’			0
‘ the danger is we get dragged into an open ended involvement in a @entity8 civil war ...			0
the truth is the @entity68 people have seen this movie , they know how it ends and that ’s why the public is two to one against bombing @entity8 ’ mr @entity2 , who told @entity9 this week that intervention in @entity8 had to be ‘ limited ’ , yesterday went further insisting on waiting for the report by the small team of chemical weapons specialists who have begun inspections in @entity141 , in the east of @entity8 on monday and will be there until at least tomorrow			1
not only will their report need to be scrutinised by the @entity44 but it will have to be voted on by them - despite the fact @entity12 ’s backers , @entity148 and @entity149 are among its five permanent members			0
mr @entity2 ’s amendment went even further to confirm ‘ such action relates solely to efforts to deter the use of chemical weapons and does not sanction any wider action in @entity8			1

@entity2 said he would consider backing ' limited force ' on tuesday
made six demands which the government needs to meet
*include* full weapons report and a ‘ clear basis in international law ’
