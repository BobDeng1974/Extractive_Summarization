by @entity0 @entity1 , one of @entity4 ’s most celebrated @entity3 - starred chefs has been coming up short when it comes to paying his servers their appropriate wages and tips			1
a multimillion - dollar class action lawsuit accuses the celebrity chef of pocketing the gratuities from private events held at his restaurants , and forcing servers to perform non-tipped work on the side			2
the extra work sees them paid at the same low rate as if they were waiting tables and includes menial tasks such as cleaning bathrooms , taking out the garbage and vacuuming floors			1
usually , a worker performing such tasks would be paid at a higher rate of $ 8 - an - hour ( the minimum wage ) , but they instead receive only $ 5 an hour for tipped work			1
sneaky chef : chef @entity1 has an international food empire that includes more than a dozen restaurants and nearly as many cookbooks , yet a lawsuit alleges he has found ways to pay servers less than they are entitled mr. @entity1 ’s troubles highlight a pervasive problem in the restaurant industry			2
while high - end restaurants are dependent on immigrant labor , and many of those workers have advanced , most find themselves cornered in lower - paying jobs			2
the plaintiffs are servers , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
the trio are confident that their lawsuit will stand			0
' @entity1 is one of the best restaurants , not only in @entity4 or the @entity59 , but in the world , ' the servers ’ attorney @entity56 told the @entity61			1
@entity63 chef ! @entity1 faces a multimillion - dollar lawsuit that claims he stiffed his servers on wages and tips ' workers deserve to be treated fairly , ' he said , and estimated the pool of plaintiffs could eventually reach 500			1
the servers are seeking unspecified damages for tips and wages going back to 2008			0
during that time , the @entity76 chef has earned heaps of accolades , including coveted @entity3 stars , yet none of the glory is passed down to those who work to keep the restuarant running on a daily basis			2
meanwhile , customers pay up to $ 220 for a prix - fixe tasting menu at a number of mr @entity1 's restaurants			1
some servers have already spoken out about the unfair payments			0
@entity90 worked as a busser at @entity92 and @entity93 between 2007 and 2012			0
she says she spent much of her shift doing ' side work ' such as sweeping and taking out garbage			0
however while she was doing that , she ' was wrongfully paid the lower , tipped - credit minimum wage rate , rather than the non-tipped minimum wage			1
' eponymous : @entity1 , his flagship @entity4 namesake , was awarded three @entity3 stars in the 2010 @entity3 , the book 's highest rating			1
in january of 2013 , @entity107 was inducted into @entity108 @entity109 also claims she was ' required to engage in a tip distribution scheme ' and that she was not compensated for overtime work			0
although the federal @entity113 does allow employers to pay their workers a lower minimum wage if those employees receive tips , the law requires that the employee ’s wages and tips combined must equal at least the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour if the employee does not receive enough tips to reach the standard minimum wage , the employer is required to provide the employee with sufficient wages to make up the rest			1
according to the lawsuit , ' the @entity131 restaurants have a corporate policy or practice of minimizing labor costs by unlawfully taking a tip credit against the minimum wage rate '			1
it is an unfortunate fact that , in efforts to cut costs by businesses , employees are often the ones who suffer the consequences			0
on the line : the servers are seeking unspecified damages for tips and wages going back to 2008 there are laws in place , though , to prevent employers from taking advantage of their employees			0
the wage and hour class action lawsuit was filed against the chef in 2012			0
in 2013 @entity1 tried to end the proceedings by denying @entity163 ’s allegations but the judge denied @entity1 ’s request saying that the case was too fact - intensive and could not be rushed			2
earlier this year , @entity1 chose to settle the lawsuit ( which is separate , yet similar in nature )			0
the chef continues to insist that he has done nothing wrong and that no laws were broken in any of his restaurants			0
the settlement covers about ninety employees who worked as servers in several of @entity1 ’s restaurants in @entity4 and were paid the lower minimum wage of employees who allegedly should be receiving tips			1
@entity1 , one of the world 's most respected chefs , has written numerous cookbooks and presides over a fleet of restaurants stretching from @entity4 and @entity185 to @entity186 and @entity187			2
his @entity4 restaurant @entity1 , now 20 years old , holds a coveted three @entity3 stars .			1

servers who should have been waiting on customers were instead doing other menial tasks such as sweeping or taking out the trash
servers allege that as they were already being paid at the $ 5 - an - hour rate they should not have been performing tasks that were **untipped**
**untipped** workers were paid the higher minimum wage of $ 8 - an - hour
@entity1 , @entity1 's eponymous restaurant in @entity4 was awarded three @entity3 stars in 2010
