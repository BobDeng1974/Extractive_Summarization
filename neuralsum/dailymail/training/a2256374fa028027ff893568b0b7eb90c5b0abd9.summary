@entity1 1 golfer @entity0 is set to be personally dragged into his multi-million pound lawsuit with management agents @entity4 for the first time			1
although @entity7 team talisman @entity6 has been in dispute with @entity4 since april 2013 , he has been kept at arm ’s length from the legal battle to extricate him from a representative contract running until the end of 2017 , by his lawyers			1
however , the mediation between the two sides — which the @entity19 judge has ordered to take place within 28 days after a preliminary hearing — would require @entity22 , as the plaintiff , to be there in person for negotiations			0
@entity0 is set to be personally dragged into his multi-million pound lawsuit with @entity4 the next step is likely to be an application for a mediation time extension as @entity0 ’s involvement in the @entity7 and next week ’s @entity33 championship allows little opportunity for talks to be staged			1
but with the @entity19 @entity38 trial date set for next february , it would suit both sides for a settlement to be agreed			0
@entity0 , despite being such an assured 25 - year - old , would hate being cross-examined by a leading @entity42			1
horizon chief @entity43 would not want to subject his other big golf client @entity46 to such an experience , either			0
if it does go to court , @entity0 could be faced with a bill for as much as £ 40million			1
@entity51 , who did n’t have the best of times as host of the opening ceremony at @entity56 , has nevertheless kept the role at @entity58			0
and although @entity51 no longer presents golf on @entity62 , her husband @entity59 is a pundit on @entity62 ’s @entity7 highlights programmes while fighting to resurrect his playing career			2
@entity65 , 65 - year - old @entity66 captain , does not like questions about his age or his @entity7 credentials @entity70 not worried by lack of action @entity7 organisers ’ guests at @entity58 include @entity76 chief executive @entity75 who was also invited to @entity77 in 2012			1
and certainly — with the next @entity79 tender looming — @entity62 ’s main rights competitors @entity81 will be reassured @entity82 is not enjoying @entity62 ’s hospitality at a tournament where they are omnipresent from overlord @entity85 downwards			2
@entity82 says he will be declaring the trip on the @entity76 entertainment register			2
former @entity90 manager sir @entity89 has been feted at @entity58 as a motivational speaker to @entity93 ’s side — but his sworn enemy @entity94 is on the @entity95 invite guest list			0
@entity65 , 65 - year - old @entity66 captain , does not like questions about his age or being reminded that he has n’t been present at a @entity7 for 21 years			1
when asked yesterday whether that was a disadvantage , @entity65 ’s cold answer was just ‘ no ’ before adding : ‘ because i ’ve played four times and i ’ve been captain once			1
’ however , rival @entity93 calls his inside involvement in the most recent tournaments a ‘ massive learning curve			0
’ @entity107 failed to mention @entity109 's cancelled sponsorship of the @entity111 team was partly due to him @entity111 cricket outcast @entity107 has been tweeting more about golf than cricket , especially about playing at @entity115			2
certainly , @entity107 would find becoming a member at @entity95 headquarters @entity115 rather easier than at nearby @entity117 , where arch - foe @entity118 plays his golf			0
however , @entity107 did tweet yesterday that @entity109 were ending their @entity111 cricket sponsorship — as revealed last summer by @entity123			0
but @entity107 did n’t say that one of the reasons why the endorsement ended was his refusal to drive a @entity109 when on international duty			0
the battle for @entity7 prominence between warring watch brands @entity132 and @entity133 is complicated by @entity132 – backed @entity134 ’s top player @entity0 being a leading ambassador for @entity133			1
they are official timekeepers for the @entity66 team			0
the size of @entity0 ’s @entity133 contract , which includes a heavy advertising campaign on @entity140 , ensures he will be wearing their watch when off the course at @entity58			1
@entity145 first minister @entity144 might have lost the referendum vote , but he is credited by the @entity95 hierarchy with doing more than anyone to bring the @entity7 to @entity145			2
a @entity150 reception at @entity151 on saturday is likely to turn into a tribute night for the departing first minister			0
@entity154 credited with doing more than anyone to bring the @entity7 to @entity145			2

@entity0 's could be forced to appear in court in @entity158
@entity160 has *ongoing* lawsuit with former management team
@entity82 a guest at @entity7
@entity65 does *n't* like being asked about his age
@entity132 sponsor @entity134 @entity7 team , but @entity133 sponsor @entity0
