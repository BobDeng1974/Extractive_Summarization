by @entity0 published : 03:46 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 06:56 est , 16 june 2013 a plumber has built what he himself admits is probably the most dangerous bicycle in the world , powered by a homemade jet engine , which can achieve speeds of 50mph			1
@entity8 , who already holds three @entity10 titles for his inventions , including the world 's fastest mobility scooter , modified his friend 's mother 's old @entity15 pushbike			1
the 32 - year - old , who has nicknamed the modified bicycle @entity20 after her , attached a jet engine to the back and extended the frame so the rider is supposedly a ‘ safe ’ distance away from the heat generated by it			1
@entity28 most dangerous bike : as this picture shows mr @entity8 's new jet powered bike is anything but safe but as the picture below shows neither mr @entity8 nor his friends are wearing safety clothes or equipment and at one point come very close to blowing themselves up			1
the @entity41 inventor is well known online for his outrageous , and often dangerous stunts			0
he last achieved notoriety when he debuted his gas powered 53mph pram last year , shortly after becoming a father for the first time			2
the video of him testing that invention , fortunately not with his newborn baby inside the pram , gained over 1.4 million views			0
mr @entity8 also features on @entity54 's @entity53 and gained his first @entity10 world record for making the world 's largest bonfire in 2006			1
he spent four months working on the bicycle , before testing it out in a local airfield			1
@entity61 propelled : the view from the seat of the jet powered bike shows how close the rider is to the exhausts and fuel canister dangerous : as this image shows the exhaust pipes are glowing red from the amount of heat generated by the jets remodelled : @entity8 took four months to build hid bike extending it at the back to protect riders from the heat generated by the jets but still extremely close to the gas canister holding the fuel the pulse jet uses the same technology as the @entity85 bombs , used during the @entity86			1
‘ this is my craziest creation yet and the scariest one to ride , " said @entity8 , from @entity87 , @entity88 , ‘ mr @entity8 admitted			2
‘ my friend 's mum was throwing out her bicycle , which she had ridden into town every day and loved so i decided to give it a new life			0
‘ i had to lengthen the frame by about a metre as the heat the jet engine chucks out is immense and i did n't want to be sitting on top of it			0
‘ it 's quite pleasant to ride at speeds of up to 35mph but after 40mph it is very shaky and extremely difficult to control			0
it has a mind of its own and goes where it wants			0
’ @entity8 has also invented the world 's fastest pushchair and longest motorbike			0
he unveiled his latest creation on @entity114 and the video has already been viewed 150,000 people in the last week			0
‘ made from an old ladies bike with a jet engine whose roots come from a bomb this really is the most dangerous , unsafe bike ever , ’ he added			0
he ’s not the first to invent the jet powered bicycle , however			1
that honour belongs to teenage @entity127 inventor @entity126 , who spent three years developing his jet engine propelled mountain bike to speeds of up to 26 mph on a flat road			2
mr @entity126 road - tested his jet engine bike for the first time in january on a road behind his house in the city of @entity137 , where the spectacle attracted a small crowd of onlookers .			2
