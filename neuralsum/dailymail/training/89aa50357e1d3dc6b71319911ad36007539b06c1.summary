worker ants change job as they age , a new study has found			1
biologists tagged every worker in six colonies and used a computer to track their movements			0
a photograph was taken every half a second over a period of six weeks and from this the scientists found that the workers fell into three separate social groups			1
female ants work to maintain the colony but the male 's role is solely to reproduce with with queen ant			1
after he has fulfilled his purpose , he dies			0
some species of ant can carry more than 50 times their own body weight			0
the total weight of all ants on the planet is roughly equal to the weight of all humans currently alive			1
ants have existed since the @entity45 period , more than 130 million years ago			1
the ants that nursed the queen and the young tended to be young , slightly older ants were responsible for cleaning the colony and the third group of ants , usually the oldest , foraged for food outside the colony			1
the six - year project by scientists at the @entity57 in @entity17 , accumulated the largest ever data of ant interactions			1
professor @entity60 , the university ’s director of ecology and @entity63 , said : ' it was a very challenging task to tag all the ants			1
we pasted code bars on to each of them and a picture was taken every half a second			0
‘ the life expectancy of an ant is about one year and we knew the age of every single ant			2
‘ we found that around a third of the workers were nurses , which almost always stayed with the queen and eggs			0
another third were cleaners and the rest were foragers , collecting food outside the colony			0
tricky : scientists admitted that tagging the ants with computerised barcodes was a laborious process tribal : researchers discovered that ants only socialised within their job groups ‘ we also found that they tend to graduate from one group to another as they age , although the career changes were not clear - cut			1
we did find very old nurses and young foragers			0
‘ we also found that the ants interacted mostly with workers from the same group			2
they do n’t try to interact with workers from another group			0
even if the colony ’s entrance and brood chamber were close together , the study showed that nurses and foragers stick to their own company and seldom mix. the team reared six colonies of carpenter ants and tagged each worker with a unique barcode			2
the colonies – comprising about 150 ants – lived in flat enclosures and were filmed by overhead cameras			2
a computer recognised the tags and recorded each individual ’s position twice a second			0
it is not yet clear how they know when and how to adapt , but the study 's findings suggest there is now evidence to show they communicate using hormones and their antenna			0
honeybees go through similar transitions from young nurses to older foragers , but this study provides the clearest evidence yet that ants do the same			2
professor @entity60 said : ‘ like bees , we have now shown that ants ’ behaviour changes with age			1

@entity17 experts have discovered complex *hierarchy* of jobs according to age
they also discovered that ants only socialise within their career groups
*previously* such behaviour had only been observed in honey bees
