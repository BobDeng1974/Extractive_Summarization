chemicals used to make till receipts could raise the risk of developing harmful diseases such as diabetes , obesity and even cancer , scientists claim			1
alarming research suggests that a substance used to produce paper in store tills , credit card machines and @entity9 could be absorbed into the blood stream			1
researchers say the chemical bisphenol - a - widely known as @entity17 - can disrupt hormones , raising the risk of a wide number of health problems			1
chemicals used to make till receipts can be absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin , disrupting hormones and raising the risk of diseases like diabetes , obesity and cancer , scientist say the chemical has already been banned in baby bottles in @entity35 because of safety fears			1
but the transparent resin is still used to line most plastic and tin food packaging - despite the calls for an all - out ban by campaigners			0
the @entity43 says strict regulations mean that the health risk from food packaging is minimal			0
but new @entity48 research suggests that the higher concentrations of @entity17 on thermal paper in till receipts - which is not regulated in the same way - poses a different route for the chemical to enter the body			1
scientists at the @entity57 have found that it can enter the blood stream through the skin			0
@entity17 is absorbed more quickly when it combines with other substances including suncream , soap or hand sanitizer , they said			2
they also warn that people could digest the chemical if they wipe their mouth after handling a till receipt - a risk that is particularly high in restaurants			2
@entity70 - the @entity70 - last year found that @entity17 posed no appreciable health risk to anyone apart from very young children			1
the organisation found that till receipts counted for no more than 15 per cent of exposure to the chemical , with the vast majority of the minimal concentrations of @entity17 in the human body coming from food packaging and diet			1
@entity70 is currently reviewing its findings , with a new report due by @entity85			0
but the @entity48 scientists said till receipts are a much greater threat than previously thought			0
professor @entity89 , whose work is published in the journal @entity92 , said bpa had been shown to interfere with oestrogen , the female fertility hormone , and other vital chemical balances in the human body			0
campaigners have called for an all - out ban for the bisphenol - a chemical in till receipts ‘ store and fast food receipts , airline tickets , atm receipts and other thermal papers all use massive amounts of @entity17 on the surface of the paper as a print developer , ’ he said			1
‘ the problem is , we as consumers often have hand sanitizers , hand creams , soaps and sunscreens on our hands that drastically alter the absorption rate of the @entity17 found on these receipts			2
’ in the study , researchers tested human subjects who cleaned their hands with hand sanitizer and then held thermal paper receipts			1
in a second test , the participants who had handled the thermal paper then were given chips to eat with their hands			0
the result was that @entity17 was absorbed very rapidly , professor @entity89 said			2
‘ our research found that large amounts of @entity17 can be transferred to your hands and then to the food you hold and eat as well as be absorbed through your skin , ’ he said			0
‘ bpa exhibits hormone - like properties and has been proven to cause reproductive defects in foetuses , infants , children and adults as well as cancer , metabolic and immune problems in rodents			0
‘ bpa from thermal paper will be absorbed into your blood rapidly ; at those levels , many diseases such as diabetes and disorders such as obesity increase as well			2
‘ using bpa or other similar chemicals that are being used to replace @entity17 in thermal paper poses a threat to human health			2
’ @entity163 safety campaign group the @entity164 called for an all - out ban for @entity17 in till receipts			1
@entity167 , director of the group , said : ‘ till receipts are such a routine part of daily life , yet this research shows that bisphenol a used in them can rapidly move through our skin and into our bloodstream			0
‘ this chemical has been used for decades and it is shocking that the scale of this exposure has only just been identified			0
