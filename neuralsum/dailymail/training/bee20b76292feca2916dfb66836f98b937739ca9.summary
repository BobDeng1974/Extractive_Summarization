mean - spirited @entity1 chiefs have already banned frisbees , flags and oversized hats in a list of oppressive rules to keep ticketholders under control			1
but now it has emerged sports fans will also be hauled out of official @entity12 venues for daring to wear a @entity14 t - shirt - simply because it is not an accredited sponsor			1
in the latest example of the increasing dominance of commercial sponsors in international sport , the draconian law was revealed by @entity1 supremo @entity22 today as he defended claims of a heavy - handed approach to protecting endorsers ' rights			1
fizzy - drinks fans , however , can still get past the tightly guarded turnstiles as long as they only wear t - shirts bearing the slogan of bitter rivals @entity31 - an ' @entity32 '			1
tight security : @entity22 , left , said @entity1 ticketholders caught wearing a @entity14 t - shirt at any of the @entity1 ' official venues will be thrown out by security there was some good news for logo lovers , though , as @entity42 trainers would ' probably ' be allowed through security despite not making the list of accredited brands , he told @entity47 's @entity46			1
presenter @entity48 challenged the former gold - winning athlete on whether he would be allowed to turn up to an event in a @entity14 t - shirt			2
lord @entity22 told him : ' no , you probably would n’t be walking in with a @entity14 t - shirt because @entity31 are our sponsors and they have put millions of pounds into this project but also millions of pounds into grassroots sport			1
it is important to protect those sponsors			0
' asked whether he could wear @entity42 trainers , @entity22 said : ' i think you probably could ... ' memorable : the @entity63 sculpture in front of the @entity65 will be a feature of the @entity1 unlike spectators with @entity14 t - shirts @entity1 crackdown : among the many items banned at the @entity1 , balls , long - lens cameras , clothing with political statements , noisemakers and bottled water are just a few on the list pressed to give a definite answer , the peer said : ' let ’s put some reality in this			1
you probably would be able to walk through with @entity42 trainers			1
does that satisfy you ? ' his comments came weeks after organisers revealed a list of restricted items banned from the @entity1			2
frisbees are already banned , as are long - lens cameras , @entity94 t - shirts and vuvuzelas			2
security will be tight with airport - style restrictions on liquids greater than 100ml and no more than one soft - sided bag is allowed and must fit under the spectator ’s seat			1
at the @entity105 in @entity106 , thousands of @entity104 football fans wore patriotic orange clothing emblazoned with the name of @entity104 beer @entity109 when the official tournament sponsor was rival budweiser			2
unfortunately for them , officials took a dim view of the protest and forced them to take off their orange lederhosen bearing the beer 's name and watch the game in their underpants			0
lord @entity22 also hit out at the negativity surrounding the build - up to the @entity1			1
the former athlete said people were ' overwhelmingly very positive ' about the event , despite concerns over security , transport and strict sponsorship rules			0
' there are things we have done really well , ' he insisted , highlighting praise he had received from athletes and the international media about the facilities built for the @entity1			0
setting out the scale of the task , @entity22 said : ' this is really , really complicated			2
this is the ability to stage in 19 days , in this city , 26 simultaneous world championships			0
' lord @entity22 said the venues had been ' built on time and to schedule ' and the organising committee had ' raised the bar ' in terms of delivering an @entity1			1
but he added : ' this is a challenge , this is a very , very tough project			0
no city is challenged in the way a city is challenged when it delivers an @entity1			0
' asked whether a ' negative narrative ' was taking hold , @entity22 said : ' i ’m neither cavalier about this or overly sanguine			2
it comes with the territory			0
' marketing ploy : at the @entity105 in @entity106 , thousands of @entity104 football fans wore patriotic orange clothing emblazoned with the name of @entity104 beer @entity109 when the official tournament sponsor was rival @entity166 he added : ' i ’m talking to people who think they have come to a games that has delivered in the areas that they need in a way that no @entity1 has delivered before			0
' i spent time in the village yesterday talking to athletes that were complimenting us about the @entity178 ’ @entity179 we have presented			0
' one @entity183 broadcaster came up to me - ‘ i ’ve been to four games , this is by a distance the best broadcast facility ’			0
' everywhere we go , the reality of it is people are overwhelmingly very positive about what we are doing			0
' with the build - up to the games overshadowed by the @entity194 guards row , @entity22 said : ' believe it or not , this is not a security event with a little bit of sporting overlay ... the sport will start , the torch is arriving in @entity201 today , the sport will start literally hours after the opening ceremony			1
' that ’s what we have spent seven years delivering and i think the teams have done a pretty good job			0

lord @entity22 said @entity31 is allowed as an ' @entity32 '
he defended claims of heavy - handed approach to protecting sponsor rights
@entity42 trainers would ' probably ' be allowed past security despite not making the list of accredited brands
