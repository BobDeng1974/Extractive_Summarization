the second @entity13 bomber was still wounded and unable to talk during the hearing on monday , but he did n't express any emotion when he was read his @entity17 rights			1
the only movements he made during the constitutionally - mandated interaction were when he mouthed the word ' no ' when asked if he could afford a lawyer , and when he nodded his head to note that he did understand his rights			1

@entity62 has been communicating with law enforcement officials by writing on a pad after suffering an injury to his throat during the frenzied manhunt for him which renders him unable to talk			0
however , the moment he was read his rights on monday - which as a citizen of the @entity79 entitle him to the constitutional right to remain silent and seek a lawyer - he stopped communicating			1
indeed , it has been claimed that federal agents were surprised when a magistrate judge and a representative from the @entity79 attorney 's office entered the hospital room and read @entity4 his rights , four officials and one law enforcement official said			1
investigators had planned to keep questioning him			0
this apparent confusion came after the @entity94 decided against treating @entity4 as an enemy combatant			1

a piece of remote control equipment has been found amongst the debris at the scene of the bombing			1
experts say it would have been triggered just blocks away from the site of the bomb confused reports about the shootout in a @entity65 backyard have emerged			2
officials now claim that @entity4 was unarmed as he hid in boat in @entity152			1
this contradicts @entity65 police commissioner 's account of hour - long firefight with @entity4 @entity62 is recovering in a hospital from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt last friday			1
