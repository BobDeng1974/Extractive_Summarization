by @entity0 police officers in @entity2 are reportedly confiscating the meager earnings of street beggars and labelling the loose change as the ' proceeds of crime '			1
there have been at least eight cases in the past year where homeless people in the @entity13 city 's centre have had their cash seized , according to charity @entity16			1
' our outreach teams have reported seeing people quietly begging and having their little cup of change taken away because it is an offence to beg , ' the welfare group 's chair , @entity17 , told @entity24			1
she said it is a ' common problem ' and hundreds of her clients have been fined around $ 100 for begging			2
this is a stock photo taken of a man sleeping in freezing temperatures on the street ' there 's a lot of myth around how much people make begging			1
it is opportunistic and short lived			0
they normally make around 12 - 20 dollars			0
and they might only beg for a couple of hours just to make enough cash for what they need , a meal or toiletries , because they hate begging , ' ms @entity17 said			1
one client had his begging change seized on christmas eve			2
' he was begging because he knew there was a public holiday and he knew that non of the charities would be open for support , ' ms @entity17 reasoned			2
' he was devastated to lose that money because he had two children that he was hoping to see and would arrive empty handed			0
' police on the streets of @entity2 's @entity31 reportedly told @entity62 on tuesday that they enforce begging laws			1
however , @entity60 spokeswoman sergeant @entity64 said she did not know of any cash seizures			2
there are over 100,000 homeless people in @entity68			2
this photo shows a homeless man begging for money in @entity72 's @entity31 a 1966 @entity13 law called ' begging or gathering alms ' states a person must not beg or gather alms and a person must not cause , procure or encourage a child to beg or gather alms			1
alms are defined as gifts of money , clothes , or food to poor people			0
the maximum penalty if found guilty is 12 months imprisonment			0
ms @entity17 has called for the law to be scrapped and said it is an old law ' from different times that is ineffective and does n't reflect reality '			0
some of her clients have been fined three times in one day			0
once police have seized cash from begging they do not return it , ms @entity17 explained			1
instead , she said some officers have taken her clients to charities and tipped the cash into communal donations boxes			0
she called this process an ' inefficient redistribution '			0
she explained there has been a 40 per cent increase in homelessness in @entity2 's @entity31 in the past year which has led to beggars on the street seeming more common			1
she said their need is ' very genuine ' and that while they are sleeping on the streets many concur that they may as well place a sign in front of them to ask for help at the same time			0
' it is a sign of crisis in plain sight in our streets , ' she said			0
one man 's begging cup was seized by police on @entity127 , the charity @entity16 said she also explained she believes giving money , while a ' deeply personal choice ' , is more helpful than giving food to the homeless			1
' try to imagine what it would be like if you never ever had the chance to choose what to eat , ' she said			0
' people are living off a constant diet of bad food and fast food and people would rather choose what they can eat			0
' the @entity16 is the only free medical clinic for the homeless in the @entity31 and @entity146 cares for 6,000 people each year			1
there are currently 105,237 people in @entity68 who are homeless			2
the state of @entity13 has 22,789 homeless people , the second largest amount behind @entity153 which has 28,190 , according to the 2011 @entity154 .			1
