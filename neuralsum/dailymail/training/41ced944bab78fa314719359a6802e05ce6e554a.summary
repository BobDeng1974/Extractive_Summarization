today , a meeting at @entity2 's headquarters in @entity15 , @entity12 was interrupted by 200 protesters waving placards and chanting			2
loud and proud : workers picket a @entity2 in @entity8 this week claiming the firm is using unfair labour practices and ' punishing ' troublemakers @entity2 is the world 's largest private employer and has long been a target of workers ' rights groups , who advocate higher wages , more flexibility in hours and an end to punishments , such as reduced shifts , which they claim are meted out to staff seeking to unionise			1
@entity34 , a department manager , told @entity35 that for many years she kept quiet about what she views as the company 's unjust practices because she was afraid of being fired if she spoke out			1
ms @entity34 , who works at the @entity2 in @entity39 , is one of thousands of members of @entity18 , an organisation backed by the @entity18			2

driven to action : the roving picket line hit at least three walmarts around @entity8 , travelling in a charter bus , private vehicles and the @entity18 mobile last thursday , about 30 employees from the @entity2 demonstrated outside the store with signs that read ' @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ' and ' stop trying to @entity65 '			2

' everyone else has a union , ' said ms @entity75			2
' workers in every other country — @entity86 , the @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 — have been able to form a union , except the @entity93 and @entity94			1
' we just do n't understand the double standard @entity2 has			0
how come those in other countries get to have a voice , yet not in the @entity93 , its home country ? ' unionising : the strike action was organised by the @entity18 and our @entity2 @entity2 spokesman @entity102 disputed her claims , insisting that most employees have ' repeatedly rejected unionisation			0
' they seem to recognise that @entity2 has some of the best jobs in the retail industry — good pay , affordable benefits and the chance for advancement , ' he said			0
@entity2 has hit the headlines on several recent occasions			0
in mid-september , warehouse workers in @entity39 went on a 15 - day strike that included a six - day , 50 - mile pilgrimage for safe jobs			1

' the $ 16billion company , however , argues that the @entity39 rally was simply a ' publicity stunt by the @entity18 to seek media attention in order to further their political agenda and financial objectives ' , according to mr @entity137			2
ms @entity34 , who started on $ 7.40 an hour and now makes $ 13.20 , said : ' we just wanted to be treated like humans , not robots			0
we do have health insurance , but in most cases , you 're not even making enough to live on , let alone take anyone to the hospital			0
' although she worries about losing her job , she did n't see another option but to voice her anger			0
' we are still worried that they might retaliate , ' she added			0
' we know exactly how they operate			0
they wait until you feel confident , or put down your guard , and then they come after you one way or another			0
but that 's how tired we are of what 's going on in the stores			0
