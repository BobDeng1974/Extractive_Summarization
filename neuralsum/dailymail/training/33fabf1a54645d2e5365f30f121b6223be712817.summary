by @entity1 reporter published : 14:20 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 16:53 est , 25 january 2013 @entity2 looks ghoulish ; the teacups take on a psychedelic life of their own and the @entity5 is transformed into a dystopian hellhole			0
this is n't a tetchy parent complaining of a long day of queues at @entity10 's @entity5 but rather the description of a new film which is exciting the critics but causing some uproar in the ' @entity15 '			1
@entity17 's , @entity16 , a dark movie set among the backdrop of the @entity10 theme parks in @entity20 and @entity21 is all the talk of this year 's @entity22			1
the film was secretly filmed in @entity10 's parks without permission ca n't look : @entity10 are ' aware ' of the film but not commenting on what they 'll do			1
backers of @entity16 said they expected the company to try and block its release however , if @entity10 get in the way it may never be released			1
the black and white film , which follows a man suffering a breakdown while on vacation with his wife and two children , was recorded entirely in secret across the tourist hotspots			2
it is packed full of disturbing imagery as its protagonist slips into madness and is haunted by the park 's ghoulish characters and vertigo inducing rides - a world away from the company 's squeaky - clean corporate image			0
@entity10 told @entity60 they were ' aware ' of the film and were ' not currently commenting '			2
film experts at the festival seemed agreed that @entity10 would likely take out a lawsuit			2
if opposed and a block goes ahead audiences will miss out on film described by @entity68 as a ' bizarre , sophomoric , hallucinatory ' and ' gutsy ' film shot entirely undercover , which has attracted the critics with it 's directional flair and eerie soundtrack			1
surreal : the film follows a father 's dark mental breakdown while on vacation with his family at a theme park			1
the crew secretly recorded it in @entity82 and @entity15 over 24 days without getting caught tourists : the film 's cast mixed among the many tourists , left , visiting @entity10 's theme parks to avoid detection			1
they also had their scripts and directions on iphones and mixed with the crowds during parades , right ' it took a lot of planning			0
we were careful and cautious and tried not to draw too much attention to ourselves			0
but planning was the main thing , " the director told the festival after the film premiered last friday			2
' we almost got caught once			0
... we were shooting in the entrance of the park and we had to do a few takes and basically they thought our team was just paparazzi and we were shooting a famous family ( entering the park ) , ' ' it was very scary that day			0
' the director hid the microphone in his sock and he , the crew and his actors pretended to be tourists visiting the famous theme parks			0
buzz : indie flick @entity16 is the talk of this year 's @entity22 spaced - out mountain : the film was described as a ' hallucinatory ' by the @entity68			1
it has been well - received by critics mostly impressed by the clandestine way it was shot unhappy holiday : the family in @entity16 are thrown into an unusual vacation to the theme park when father , @entity131 , suffers a breakdown after finding out he has lost his job they had scripts and directions on their iphones so could appear they were casually glancing at their phones while preparing for each take and used slr cameras to film the action they managed to go undetected for ten days at @entity10 's theme parks in @entity144 and two weeks @entity15 , @entity21			1
if @entity17 wants the film to go ahead , he may not be going the right way in winning around the corporation when discussing his ' inspiration '			2
' heavily influenced by various strange outings i endured as a boy with my father -- who at the time lived in @entity144 , @entity20 -- ' @entity16 ' is my personal attempt to make sense of what felt like a very artificial childhood , brought on by our cultural obsession with these fake , manufactured worlds of so - called fantasy , ' he said secretive : the crew , some pictured , led by director @entity17 , 1st left , recorded escape from tomorrow across @entity15 and @entity82 over 24 days			1
they were almost caught once when mistaken as paparazzi ' i think the film is really about defining the word ' escape ' and how so many @entity174 households seek it out in a yearly pilgrimage to a materialistic @entity176			0
' it may well be that the small world is too small for both of them but not everyone at the festival is agreed @entity10 would win a legal challenge			0
@entity184 , a law professor at @entity185 , told the @entity186 : ' it 's a film that falls pretty squarely in the territory of fair use , which addresses copyright			0
and to establish trademark infringement they 'd have to prove that a reasonable person would think @entity10 is endorsing the movie , and i think they 'd have a hard time doing that			0

escape from tomorrow is a surreal *fictional* drama shot secretly in @entity82 and @entity15 currently being aired at the @entity22 , @entity200
director @entity17 failed to get permission for the creepy film shot on *handheld* cameras which follows a father 's trippy breakdown while on vacation in the park
@entity10 has failed to comment on the film but festival buzz expects the corporation to try to block its release
