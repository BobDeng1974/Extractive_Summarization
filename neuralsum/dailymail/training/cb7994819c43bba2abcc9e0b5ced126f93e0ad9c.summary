deputy prime minister @entity0 this morning rejected calls for a @entity3 - style inquiry into historic sex abuse allegations - despite growing concern over the disappearance of a dossier detailing explosive claims of sex abuse by paedophiles within @entity11			1
mr @entity0 said the police should be in charge of getting to the bottom of what happened to vulnerable children in care homes , following claims that high profile individuals were part of a paedophile network targetting children			0
the @entity25 leader 's remarks came after former home secretary @entity26 admitted receiving a file containing allegations of a child abuse network operating in @entity11			2
he said he was given the file by the @entity32 mp @entity31 in 1983 and launched an investigation into the claims			1
@entity0 said child sex abuse allegations should be handled by the police and rejected calls for a @entity3 - style public inquiry a dossier detailing explosive claims of sex abuse by paedophiles within @entity11 has gone missing			2
given to home secretary @entity26 in 1983 , the files allegedly exposed a vile network at @entity44 and @entity45 @entity26 , 74 , is now facing questions over his handling of the document and inconsistencies in his account of what he did with it.the @entity53 peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given the dossier			1
but in a statement yesterday morning , he changed his mind			1
he confirmed he was handed a ‘ substantial bundle of papers ’ by mr @entity31 in november 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation			1
he said : ‘ i do not recall being contacted further about these matters by @entity66 officials or by mr @entity31 or by anyone else			1
’ hours later @entity26 amended his account again after proof emerged that he had written to mr @entity31 in march 1984 informing him the dossier had been assessed by prosecutors and handed to police			1
@entity66 officials say they have searched for the dossier but can not find it			2
last night @entity75 mp @entity74 , who has challenged @entity26 to explain how he dealt with the allegations , demanded to know what police had done with the information provided by the late mr @entity31 and called for a @entity3 - style public inquiry into historic sex abuse			1
but mr @entity0 , who worked for @entity26 in @entity82 when the @entity53 peer was a @entity85 commissioner , rejected mr @entity74 's call			1
he said : ' i would support anything that helps get to the truth and crucially delivers justice for those victims who - if these horrific allegations fo abuse in in childre 's homes in various parts of the country turn out to be true - have suffered for years in silence , and their plight has gone unrecognised			0
' my view is , given the very serious criminal nature of these allegations - namely that there was a circle of people who hid what they were doing , that what they were doing was abusing vulnerable children in children 's homes - the only way to deliver justice , even in the years afterwards , is allow the police to get to the bottom of these things			0
' that 's why i would urge anybody who has any information , any evidence which they think might be relevant to this , to pass it to the police			0
' the police already - as you probably know - are conducting inquiries into the children 's homes in the north west , in south west @entity130 and elsewhere			0
' i really want to see the police see that through			0
so that for me , i think , is the absolute priority for anybody who wants to see justice done			0
' the @entity53 peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given the dossier			1
but in a statement yesterday morning , he changed his mind			1
he confirmed he was handed a ' substantial bundle of papers ' by mp @entity31 ( pictured ) in november 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation mr @entity0 said he could not provide ' too much additional insight into what happened in the @entity66 in the mid- 1980s '			1
but he added : ' my understanding is as @entity26 explained yesterday - and the @entity66 explained - when he was home secretary , information was passed on and the relevant bits of information were passed onto the prosecuting authorities and the police , and that the @entity66 is not in possession anymore - following an independent trawl through the records conducted last year - is not in possession anymore of the full documentation			1
' he added : ' most importantly i want to see the police getting to the bottom of what was alleged to have happened - which is absolutely horrific in some of the children ’s homes up and down the country			0
mr @entity0 said : ' i just want the truth to come out and justice to be done and i think when we are dealing with something of such a criminal nature - i do n’t think there is any surrogate really for allowing police to get to the bottom of what happened			0
' but @entity75 's mr @entity74 said @entity26 needed to explain what happened to the dossier			2
mr @entity74 said : ‘ the impression conveyed is that sir @entity26 does not want to talk about this			1
it goes right to the heart of an attitude in politics that child abuse is a subject best avoided			0
' he should reveal what he knew at the time about paedophile networks and what action he took			0
’ the @entity194 mp – who helped expose the full extent of @entity198 mp sir @entity197 ’s paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year , serialised by the @entity200 – is calling for a @entity3 - style inquiry into child abuse allegations against politicians			1
@entity75 mp @entity74 , who has challenged @entity26 to explain how he dealt with the allegations , demanded to know what police had done with the information provided by the late mr @entity31 a lawyer representing alleged victims of abuse at the south - west @entity211 reportedly named in the dossier , criticised the loss of the document			1
@entity215 , head of the abuse team at @entity217 , said : ‘ my clients are incredulous at how this dossier can have simply disappeared			2
it seems inconceivable that a document of such importance can have simply disappeared			2
‘ i would strongly support the calls for a widespread inquiry into historic sexual abuse so that my clients could have their many questions answered about who knew what and that a very troubling veil is lifted from the corridors of power			2
’ the prime minister ’s official spokesman declined to back mr @entity74 ’s demands for an over-arching inquiry – a call which has garnered the support of 120 mps			0
he said independent inquiries were already under way into allegations relating to the @entity240 and the @entity241			0
but when asked whether there should be an independent inquiry into allegations of @entity11 paedophile rings , he referred to last year ’s @entity66 review			0
the @entity194 mp - who helped expose the full extent of @entity198 mp sir @entity197 's ( pictured ) paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year , serialised by the @entity200 - is calling for a @entity3 -- style inquiry into child abuse allegations against politicians asked to comment on the @entity31 dossier , @entity254 said last night : ‘ the @entity256 is currently assessing information and conducting a number of investigations under @entity260			1
any material submitted to us , historic or current , is reviewed to establish if it is relevant to these			0
’ @entity264 , former children ’s minister , told @entity265 : ‘ in order to restore confidence in our child protection system , because things have got a lot better , we need an overarching inquiry that puts all this into context and makes recommendations so we can make sure we have a child protection service that is fit for purpose			2
‘ the victims must come first			0
and those many victims , many hundreds if not thousands who have been suffering often in silence going back to the 60s , 70s , 80s who have been emboldened to come forward			0
' at last we are listening to them and their stories are being taken seriously but we need to find out why they were n’t taken seriously when these offences happened			0

@entity26 , 74 , is facing questions over handling of ' explosive ' document
@entity53 peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given it
in a statement yesterday morning , however , he changed his mind
confirmed he was given ‘ bundle of papers ’ by mp @entity31
he now says he passed them to officials in 1983 for further investigation
