' i am indeed a quiet and private individual ; while i have imagined what it would be like to save a life i never believed i would be put in such a situation			2
' it touches me truly and deeply to read online that parents are telling their children about me and telling them that real heroes do exist			0
' @entity0 is a dean 's list senior at the small , @entity42 college in a leafy neighborhood north of downtown @entity6			1
shooting suspect @entity44 is being held without bail and has been on suicide watch at @entity47 in @entity6 he was working as a building monitor when the gunman walked into @entity50 and began firing a shotgun			1

@entity0 said he has been overwhelmed after supporters bought items on a wedding registry for him and his fiancee to my brothers and sisters at @entity18 , and my brothers and sisters in @entity113 throughout the nation and the world , words can not come close to expressing the tragedy that occurred this past week on our campus			1
like everyone else , i would hear of these horrible events on the news , but go home knowing that it could never happen to us			0
on thursday , my life changed			2
i was thrown into a life and death situation , and through @entity63 ’s grace i was able to stop the attacker and walk away unharmed			2
as i try to return to a normal life in the aftermath of this horrible event , i pray above all things for strength for the victims and their families			2
while my experience left me in physical shock , i know that many people are dealing with much greater grief than i have experienced , and in honesty i probably would not be able to handle myself right now if i had personally known the victims			2
i know that i am being hailed as a hero , and as many people have suggested i find this hard to accept			1
i am indeed a quiet and private individual ; while i have imagined what it would be like to save a life i never believed i would be put in such a situation			2
it touches me truly and deeply to read online that parents are telling their children about me and telling them that real heroes do exist			0
however , what i find most difficult about this situation is the devastating reality that a hero can not come without tragedy			2
in the midst of this attention , we can not ignore that a life was taken from us , ruthlessly and without justification or cause			0
others were badly injured , and many more will carry this event with them the rest of their lives			0
nonetheless , i would encourage that hate be met with love			0
when i came face to face with the attacker , @entity63 gave me the eyes to see that he was not a faceless monster , but a very sad and troubled young man			1
while i can not at this time find it within me to forgive his crime , i truly desire that he will find the grace of @entity63 and the forgiveness of our community			0
i would like to truly thank the responders who secured the building and the medical staff who looked after myself and those who were injured			0
after being in this situation myself , it is even harder to imagine what it would be like to have a job where one ’s life is willingly put on the line every day			0
to our police , emergency responders , and armed forces , you have my greatest respect			0
i am overwhelmed with the incredible generosity that has been showered upon me			0
it has been deeply touching to read the comments online and realize that my actions have had such a strikingly widespread effect			0
moving forward , i am strongly requesting that any future donations be given to the victims through @entity18			0
i am grateful for the prayers and support coming from our home city and afar			0
in these next few days , weeks , and months , please continue to pray for everyone in the @entity212			0
we serve a truly awesome @entity63 and i firmly believe that it is through him alone that we will find the strength to heal from this tragedy			0

@entity0 , 22 , spraying and tackling shooter @entity44 while he reloaded at a @entity6 campus last thursday
he has been hailed as a hero who *prevented* greater loss of life , but @entity0 has had a hard time *adjusting* to his hero status
he has all but *shunned* the media since the attack , but released a statement on monday
he said the gunman appeared to be a sad , troubled young man , not a monster
