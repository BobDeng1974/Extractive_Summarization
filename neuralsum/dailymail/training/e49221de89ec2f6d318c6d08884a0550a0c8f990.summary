the @entity0 offered an apology of sorts on thursday to dr. @entity3 , a black potential @entity4 presidential candiidate , for lumping him in with neo-nazis , skinheads , and @entity7 on its influential ' @entity9 ' website			1
the iconic @entity11 civil rights group targeted @entity3 , a world - renowned retired pediatric neurosurgeon , because he is a @entity13 who opposes gay marriage			1
the @entity0 has seen its mission creep from defendng the civil rights of african - americans to embracing a broader target list that includes ' white nationalists , anti-gay zealots , black separatists , racist skinheads , neo-confederates ' and others			1
' in october 2014 , we posted an " @entity27 " of dr. @entity3 , ' the @entity0 wrote in a statement on thursday			1
' this week , as we 've come under intense criticism for doing so , we 've reviewed our profile and have concluded that it did not meet our standards , so we have taken it down and apologize to dr. @entity3 for having posted it			2
' the mea culpa quickly took on a backhanded quality , however			0
the bulk of the published statement consisted of a list of those quotes			0
@entity3 's attack at the hands of the @entity0 was a hot topic of discussion among @entity11 conservatives this week as @entity3 moves closer to announcing a @entity78 run			1
' i do n't think the left can stand the idea that the next black president might be a @entity4 , ' one @entity80 staffer said , requesting anonymity because he is not quthorized to speak to the press			0
' and the @entity0 is a left - wing group			2
' the @entity0 did not respond to a request for comment			2
earlier in the week @entity91 asked @entity3 if he thought the @entity0 was ' crooked ' in its dealings with @entity4			1
' oh , definitely , ' he replied			0
' and i – certainly that 's been the impression of everybody i 've heard from			2
' ' i find it very ironic that they would castigate someone as a hater whose entire professional career was spent saving people 's lives , ' he said			2
@entity3 described a scholarship program he has endowed , and literacy projects he has set up ' specifically in poor areas , so that kids can learn the love of reading , which will have a profound impact on their academic performance			2
' ' but because i do n't agree with them about traditional marriage , i 'm a " hater " , ' he mused			1
' and that 's pretty interesting that someone could come away with that belief			0
' @entity118 ( left ) , founded the @entity119 @entity7 and later ran for governor of @entity119 ; the @entity0 lists him on its ' @entity9 ' website @entity3 first attracted national notice in 2013 when he chastized president @entity123 from a few feet away at the speaker 's podium during that year 's @entity126 in @entity127 , ' @entity3 said , ' is really , i think , the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery			1
' ' in a way , it is slavery , ' he added then			0
his political positions are wrapped tightly in his christianity , including opposition to gay marriage and a preference for a flat income tax rate that would affect everyone equally			1
' when i pick up by @entity144 , you know what i see ? ' he asked the prayer breakfast audience			0
' i see the first individual in the universe , @entity149 , and he ’s given us a system			0
it ’s called a tithe			0
' tithing is an institution that calls for @entity13 to donate a flat 10 per cent of their earnings to the church where they worship			2
but it 's speaking against same - sex unions that has put him on the hot seat , and may endanger his chances of emerging as a serious presidential contender outside @entity11 's bible belt			1
horror : @entity167 entered the conservative @entity169 's office in 2012 with a gun and shot a security guard , later saying he meant to kill as many people as he could ; he got the idea from the @entity0 's ' @entity9 ' website ' if we can redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures as opposed to between a man and a woman , ' he wrote in his 2012 book @entity184 , ' we will continue to redefine it in any way that we wish , which is a slippery slope with a disastrous ending			1
' more dramatically , he said during a 2013 @entity191 hannel interview that ' traditional ' marriage is ' a well - established pillar of society and no group – be they gays , be they @entity198 , be they people who believe in bestiality – it does n’t matter what they are , they do n’t get to change the definition			2
' @entity198 , the @entity198 , advocates for the normalization of pedophilia in society			0
the @entity0 had cited those examples as evidence that @entity3 belongs on the same list as white nationalists and antisemites			1
days after the @entity191 interview , he admitted on @entity213 that his comments were ' somewhat insensitive , and i certainly apologize if i offended anyone			0
' ' i have always advocated equality for everyone , ' @entity3 insisted			0
' as a @entity13 , we have a duty to love everyone and to love them as ourselves			0
you know , i love gay people			0
' on monday @entity3 told @entity91 that ' when embracing traditional christian values is equated to hatred , we are approaching the stage where wrong is called right and right is called wrong			1
' ' it is absolutely critical for us to once again advocate true tolerance in this world where freedom of speech is closely guarded			0
that means being respectful to all of those with whom we disagree , as well as allowing people to live according to their values without harassment			0
' @entity240 : the @entity0 listed @entity3 as an ' extremist ' alongside former @entity243 ( left ) and @entity244 founder @entity242 ( right ) race politics : @entity246 ( left ) , head of the @entity247 , has attracted the @entity0 's attention but is one of only a few african - americans on the same ' extremist ' list that featured @entity3 ' it is nothing but projectionist and ignorant , ' @entity3 said , ' when groups label certain people with whom they disagree as haters			1
said behavior is truly uncouth and should be viewed as such			0
' placing an individual or organization on a high - profile , credible list of extremists can have unintended consequences			0
in august 2012 a gunman namex @entity266 entered the @entity169 's headquarters in @entity268 in an attempt – as he later explained – ' to kill as many people as possible ' @entity167 shot a security guard before he was disarmed			1
he chose his target from the @entity0 's ' @entity274 ' web page – a geographic guide to its extremist list			1
the @entity277 , like @entity3 , landed on the site because it opposes gay marriage			1
putting @entity3 on a list along with former @entity7 leader @entity118 and skinhead @entity283 ' @entity281 ' @entity280 was n't the first time the organization dabbled in national electoral politics			1
in 2011 it included @entity290 sen. @entity289 on a list titled ' @entity292 : 23 candidates on the @entity294 , ' listing ' right - wing libertarian ' as his ' @entity296			0
' @entity298 professor @entity297 , wrote friday that ' the @entity0 ceased long ago to be a neutral source of information			0
' the @entity0 did not respond to multiple requests for comment			0
the group 's controversial spokesman @entity303 did speak to the left - wing website @entity306 , however			2
no argument : holocaust denier @entity308 is on the @entity0 's list for producing publications titled ' the @entity313 we loved and why ' and ' @entity314 ? ' ' our criticism of him was based in large part on his very extreme rhetoric about the evils of gay people , ' @entity303 said			1
' he says that any criticism he makes is always kind and never meant to destroy the person , but then he says that gay marriage will lead to the destruction of @entity11 much in the same way the @entity325 collapsed			1
' in february 2014 @entity303 claimed on @entity213 that ' anti-black attitudes among @entity11 whites have gone up quite significantly between 2008 and 2012 , to the point where now more than half of white @entity11 have these anti-black attitudes			2
' @entity0 's latest nonprofit income tax return shows that its assets totaled more than $ 314 million at the end of october 2014			1
more than $ 3 million of its income between 1999 and 2008 came from the @entity335 , whose founder @entity336 earned billions – and later had to forfeit the money – from convicted scammer @entity341 's investment frauds .			0

@entity0 started as a civil rights legal aid *charity* but has since placed conservatives of many *stripes* in its *crosshairs*
it offered an apology of sorts on thursday for lumping @entity3 , a likely 2016 presidential candidate , in with the @entity7 and skinheads
the apology , however , ended with a *laundry* list of all the things he had said that angered them in the first place
a *homicidal* gunman used the @entity0 's ' @entity60 ' website in 2012 to identify his target – a @entity13 group called the @entity169
list includes prominent @entity11 who oppose gay marriage and *illegal* *immigration* , alongside @entity7 , neo-nazis and skinheads
' because i do n't agree with them about traditional marriage , i 'm a " hater " , ' the famed neurosurgeon surgeon told @entity91
