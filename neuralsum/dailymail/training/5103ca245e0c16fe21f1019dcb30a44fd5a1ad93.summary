diamond selling giant @entity0 is holding its final ' sight ' in @entity2 this week as it prepares to move its auction rooms to southern @entity4			1
the company 's international sales operations , which represents 85 out of 300 @entity2 - based @entity0 employees , are due to move to @entity8 , the @entity9 capital , from next month			1
the company handpicks 80 buyers to buy rough gems from its mines under a system of pre-determined allocations and regular sales meetings known as ' sights ' , which from next month will also be held in @entity4			2
big move : the @entity0 sales operation is to move from @entity2 to @entity8 , the capital of @entity9 , from next month trading places : diamond buyer @entity22 , from the @entity24 , sorts bags of uncut diamonds at a sightholders week at @entity0 offices in @entity2 cost : the decision to move , made in 2011 , will cost nearly £ 74million and follows years of negotiations between @entity0 and @entity9 the final week of sights to be held in @entity2 was due to end tomorrow			1
the decision to move , made in 2011 , will cost nearly £ 74million , which includes new offices in @entity8 , and follows years of negotiations between @entity33 - owned @entity0 and @entity9 , the largest producer of gem diamonds			1
the move has been hailed as the ' end of an era '			2
@entity0 , founded by @entity38 in 1888 , started trading in @entity2 towards the end of the 1930s			2
@entity41 , equity analyst at @entity42 in @entity2 , said : ' it is what you would call the end of an era , but it should not be seen as a negative , it should be seen as the natural progression of the industry			0
' but @entity51 analyst @entity50 said : ' i do n't think any of them really want to be ( in @entity8 ) , but they do n't have a choice as the diamonds are in the ground there			0
' it is akin to saying we wo n't have a @entity62 , you 'll have to go to @entity63 to get your copper			0
it is blatantly inefficient - though in terms of politics and development , if i were president i 'd do the same			0
' take - over : @entity33 last year took over @entity0 after agreeing to buy the 40 per cent stake from the @entity71 family in a £ 3.2billion deal sales : the move will shift more than £ 3.7 billion of annual rough diamond sales from @entity2 to @entity8 operations : @entity0 has already moved its diamond sorting and aggregation businesses veteran diamantaire @entity22 , founder of the @entity82 group , which is one of the buyers picked by @entity0 , said : ' i have been coming here some ten times a year for 35 years , i have missed only two or three sights			1
it is part of our routine			0
' the move secured a new 10 - year contract for the sorting , valuing and sales of diamonds from the @entity9 mines run by @entity96 , a split venture between @entity0 and the southern @entity4 country 's government			1
it will shift more than £ 3.7 billion of annual rough diamond sales from @entity2 to @entity8			1
by separating the sales from the corporate headquarters , the move is arguably the biggest challenge @entity0 has faced to the way it does business since the current sales model was set up nearly a century ago			2
' it is what you would call the end of an era , but it should not be seen as a negative , it should be seen as the natural progression of the industry ' - @entity41 , equity analyst at @entity42 in @entity2 @entity33 last year took over @entity0 after agreeing to buy the 40 per cent stake from the @entity71 family in a £ 3.2billion deal			1
the remaining 15 per cent is owned by the @entity9 government , which could exercise a right to raise its stake to 25 per cent			0
such a development would take @entity33 ’s stake back down to 75 per cent , @entity33 said			0
@entity0 has already moved its diamond sorting and aggregation businesses - the operations that sift through the production from each mine and bring the gems together before they are allocated to buyers - to @entity8			1
it has also supported cutting and polishing operations by making more diamonds available locally - encouraging international firms like @entity22 's to grow there			0
the @entity82 group now employs some 300 people in @entity9			0
@entity0 ' @entity2 sights date back to the 1930s , when it set up what became the @entity142 to control supply , secure demand and tighten its grip on the market in rough diamonds			0
approach : @entity149 ( pictured ) , who runs @entity0 ' @entity150 , said the @entity9 government told @entity0 it would like the company to sell @entity9 diamonds in the country until this month , the @entity2 sales meetings were interrupted only by the heavy bombing during the @entity156			1
but @entity0 has been battling lower production and challenges to its sales model for years , in part thanks the collapse of the @entity162 and the emergence of mines in @entity165 and @entity166 outside the firm 's influence			2
its share of rough diamond sales dropped to under 50 percent in 2006 and to 37 percent in 2012 , according to consultancy @entity171			1
in 2009 , it was overtaken in carat terms by @entity174 's @entity173			0
@entity0 says the move to @entity8 was partly motivated by wanting to keep alive the sights system , which still sells to buyers like jewellers @entity178 and @entity180 's @entity179 , and @entity182 family firms			1
@entity149 , who runs @entity0 ' @entity150 , said : ' the @entity9 government did not come to @entity0 and say please transfer your business			2
' the @entity9 government said we would like you to sell the @entity9 diamonds here			0
' we believe our business model is quite strong and provides value for @entity0 and its shareholders - so we came up with the idea of moving the whole business			0
