an inventor whose life was saved thanks to his cycling helmet has developed the world 's first flat - folding hat so people no longer have an excuse not to carry the protective headgear			1
thanks to the introduction of @entity13 in @entity14 and people inspired by @entity16 and @entity18 's victories in the @entity19 , cycling is a booming sport			2
but while it 's good for your health and can help commuters get to work faster on gridlocked roads , many are risking a serious injury - or death - by hopping onto the saddle without wearing a helmet			2
@entity31 : inventor @entity32 has created the @entity34 that can fold in half flattened : the helmet offers a solution for people who find the traditional headgear too bulky to carry around it 's a lesson inventor @entity32 learnt the hard way after he was involved in a hit and run whilst cycling in @entity43 , @entity14 , in his thirties			1
the 54 - year - old from @entity14 told @entity46 : ' if i was n't wearing a helmet than i might not still be here today			2
a car smashed into me while i was cycling and i hit the kerb			0
i broke my shoulder and ribs but my helmet took the brunt of the fall			0
if i had n't been wearing it , i could have been brain - damaged or killed			0
' the accident made @entity32 realise how important wearing a helmet is - yet he 's been shocked to see so many people hiring @entity13 across the capital and riding off without wearing a protective hat			1
portable : when folded in half , the helmet can easily fit into handbags and laptop cases he researched the matter and discovered that almost 20,000 cycling accidents occur every year in the @entity68 , yet a huge percentage of cyclists still do n't wear helmets			1
in @entity14 alone , 93 per cent of people who hire bicycles do n't wear helmets and , of those with their own bicycles , more than a quarter ( 26 per cent ) do n't wear them			1
he also found a report from the @entity76 that discovered more than 90 per cent of cycling fatalities there happened to riders who are not wearing a helmet			0
many of those who ride without one say they do so because they find traditional cycling helmets are too bulky to carry around			2
step - by - step : the helmet flattens down so people have no excuse not to take it with them so @entity32 , who has an obe for his services to innovation and has twice been named @entity92 , has come up with an ingenious solution			1
he has invented the @entity34 that can be flattened and folded in half so it fits into your bag			1
@entity32 said the product , that weighs around 250g , can easily fit into a handbag , rucksack or laptop case			1
the helmet is made from eps - expanded polystyrene - that 's rigid and tough enough to make it strong to protect heads from impact			2
but the inclusion of other plastics and nylon hinges means it can also be folded up			0
dangerous : @entity32 was alarmed by the number of people he 's seen riding around @entity14 on @entity13 bikes without wearing a helmet the technology has been patented worldwide and is currently in production with the aim of going on sale next @entity118			1
a number of leading cycling retailers in @entity68 and the @entity76 have expressed an interest in selling the product , that is estimated to cost around Â£ 60			0
@entity32 said he 's delighted his vision for a life - saving helmet is coming to fruition citing it as the ' best invention ' he 's had in his long and successful career			1
he explained : ' some years ago , i survived a horrific cycling accident			0
my helmet saved my life			0
since then i have been aware of the increasingly large number of cyclists taking to the streets without helmets and , with my experience in inventing , i wanted to see if i could help to reverse this trend			0
' with more and more people riding every day , @entity140 helmets will help to protect cyclists and save lives around the world			0

@entity34 has been invented by @entity32
he survived a car crash thanks to his bike helmet
but many cyclists do n't wear one as they are too bulky
so he 's invented protective headgear that can fold in half
it 's easy to carry in handbags , laptop cases and rucksacks
