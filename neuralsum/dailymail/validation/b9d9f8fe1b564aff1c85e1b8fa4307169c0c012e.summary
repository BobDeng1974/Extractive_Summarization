@entity1 manager @entity0 has noticed no difference in @entity4 's mood ahead of his side 's huge @entity6 qualifier in @entity8 and believes the @entity10 superstar is ready to perform			1
@entity4 has had to endure a rough ride in @entity12 of late , with his worth to @entity10 being questioned by both fans and the powerful @entity10 media			1
the world 's most expensive player has been booed by his own supporters and had his car attacked outside the club 's training ground following last weekend 's @entity22 defeat to bitter rivals @entity23			2
@entity1 captain @entity24 ( left ) shares a joke with @entity4 ( right ) in training on friday but @entity0 insists @entity4 remains relaxed around the @entity1 camp and the thought of him having a conversation with the forward about his club situation has not even entered his head			1
' i can not see any difference in @entity35 at all , ' @entity0 said on the eve of @entity38 's top two sides meeting in @entity39 on saturday night			1
' if i thought it was bothering him , and we 're all human beings so i know it can bother you from time to time and you can get a bit down , and it was a problem then i would have sat down with him and had that conversation			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in @entity39 on saturday @entity10 star @entity4 , who has received harsh criticism in recent weeks , appears relaxed in training ' but we have not mentioned @entity10 , we have only talked about @entity1 , @entity8 and the job in hand			1
' he is happy , relaxed and more importantly he is fit and ready to play			2
' @entity4 has been singled out for some rough treatment in the group so far , most noticeably from @entity54 last october , and the 25 - year - old could be a marked man again on a night where a hostile atmosphere is expected as group leaders @entity8 defend their unblemished record against second - placed @entity1			1
@entity8 coach @entity60 insists his side do not have players ' strong enough to kick @entity4 out of the game ' but @entity0 remains philosophical about the treatment his star man could receive at the @entity64			1
@entity65 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) watch on as @entity1 defender @entity66 holds possession ' we can not come back without anything , ' @entity0 said			1
' that is not the stage we are at			2
we know what we are up against and they will know that about us			2
' their game against @entity76 on tuesday will not exist for them , they are only thinking about us and that is not our business			2
@entity4 holds off his team - mates in training as @entity1 hope to maintain their unbeaten start in @entity38 ' it is up to @entity8 to do what they want to do , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity8 have to do what they have to do to get a result , as do we			1
but the attention is nothing new for @entity4			0
' he has played most of his football in the @entity93 and that is the most physically demanding league in the world			0
' i 've also watched him out in @entity12 come through the @entity10 derbies and the @entity22 and we know all the focus will be on him			0
' but we have a good squad and our strength is our togetherness			0
' we are not here because of one player			0
@entity4 is a huge help , but he is part of something that has been growing			0
' the @entity10 star stretches during a training session in @entity8 on friday afternoon wales remain unbeaten after four games but are one point behind @entity8 , who play their match in hand at home to group favourites @entity76 on tuesday			1
@entity0 has described the @entity39 showdown as @entity1 ' biggest match since the @entity119 play - off defeat to @entity120 , and admits that failing to make the finals in @entity122 in two years ' time would hurt everyone connected with @entity126 football			1
' i was part of a couple of great @entity126 sides that never did it , qualified for a major tournament , ' @entity0 said			0
' i enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever			0
we have a good current group and we are going in the right direction but we have been here before			0
' one foot in the door does not get you there			0
i do not want to play things down , we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about			0
' but we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go and i 'm not being arrogant when i say it 's about us and not anyone else			0
