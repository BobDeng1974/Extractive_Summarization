an embarrassed local official and an adopted local hero left their unique marks on the @entity4			0
the identity of the first , a marshal who waved the chequered flag a lap early , was being concealed for his own sanity			1
the second was @entity11 , whose name is reverberating ever more profoundly across this @entity13			1
@entity14 moment : @entity11 celebrates his third win in as many races on the rostrum in @entity19 come here , @entity20 : the @entity21 celebrates with his @entity23 team after leading home another 1 - 2 dominant : @entity11 led the race from start to finish in @entity28 to register his third consecutive win commanding : the @entity23 driver started on pole position and could not be dislodged as he won in @entity28 no way through : the @entity23 ( bottom ) had far too much pace for the @entity35 of @entity36 out in front : this picture of the home straight at the @entity40 shows @entity11 's dominance click here to re-live @entity11 's victory he drove his @entity23 flawlessly to victory from pole position , prompting a huge cheer from surprisingly well - populated stands to ring out above the burr of the new turbo engines			1
' i 'm in the happiest mood that i can remember , ' said @entity11			1
' it 's where i am in my life , family , girlfriend , all things , where i live , everything , having the right people in place , management , being in the right team			0
' nothing went wrong all weekend for @entity11			1
off the track , he enjoyed the adulation of his fans at the airport , at the track and at his hotel ' every morning , every evening , day and night '			0
they even gave him a digital photo frame with a specially - made video			0
job done : @entity11 claims his third victory on the spin and punches the air in delight as he crosses the line psychological blow : @entity11 left title rival @entity80 trailing as he claimed his third win of the campaign on the track , he drove supremely in qualifying through the gloom and drizzle to set himself up for yesterday 's demonstration that took him to 25 career wins			1
the total took him past the immortal @entity90 and level with his @entity23 boss @entity92 and the @entity94 great @entity93			1
as coincidence would have it , on @entity93 's 25th and sadly final victory , in @entity98 , @entity99 on january 1 , 1968 , the chequered flag was also waved prematurely but the @entity100 was awake to the fact and raced on			1
@entity11 lifted , he said , for a second - and - a - half but was told by the team to keep going			1
the regulations , bizarrely , dictate that if the flag is waved early , the placings are taken from the preceding lap. that meant @entity110 's @entity109 's last overtaking move on @entity111 did not count			2
thankfully , they were contesting 17th place rather than the important positions at the front			0
pole position : @entity11 leads his challengers into the first corner and never relinquished his lead trailing : @entity120 in the @entity121 was well down the leaderboard at the @entity40 another consolation of sorts for the unnamed marshal is that the last flag - related error of this sort was committed by none other than @entity130			1
he had to be prompted to wave the flag in @entity133 in 2006 after the winning @entity121 of @entity134 had already whizzed by			0
in second place here was @entity11 's @entity23 team - mate @entity80			1
his telemetry failed before the race even started , so he had to think for himself rather than rely on his team 's analysis			2
having made a poor start as a result of his problems , slipping from fourth on the grid to seventh on the first lap , he bided his time coolly , squeezing up the field gradually			0
it was impressive in the circumstances			0
@entity149 , of @entity121 , drove pugnaciously to a third place that probably flattered his car			2
given that @entity11 has won three consecutive races - a feat he had never achieved before - it is amazing that @entity80 nevertheless holds a four - point lead in the championship table , by dint of his own consistency and @entity11 's mechanical failure in the opening round in @entity161			1
pursuit : @entity149 negotiates a corner in his @entity121 's ' bend : @entity11 leads the field round a series of corners spectacle : fans in the main grandstand take pictures of the start the most controversial aspect of sunday 's racing came when @entity174 was ordered to give way to his @entity35 team - mate @entity36			1
the world champion was nonplussed and asked what strategy @entity36 was on			2
' tough luck , ' was @entity174 's response when told			2
defiantly he refused to yield for a couple of laps before finally making room for his supposedly junior partner to pass			2
@entity185 , who had worn an anxious expression as the drama unfolded , excused his star driver afterwards , saying : ' he has n't won four world championships by not being a racer			0
of course , he 's going to question the instruction to understand it , but as soon as he understood the reasoning , bang , he moved aside			0
' coming through : @entity80 passes @entity174 on the run down to turn 1 @entity196 rules : @entity36 finished 25 seconds clear of @entity174 did he ? should he have questioned it all ? should @entity35 have employed team orders so readily ? the most surprising thing of all though is that @entity174 was again slower than @entity36			1
it was the second time he has been asked to move aside in consecutive races			0
whither the boy genius ? @entity185 said : ' he 's not getting the feedback from the car that he wants			0
the compound effect is that he 's damaging the tyres more , which is very unusual for @entity208			0
as soon as we have worked those out then i 'm sure he 'll be back with a bang			0
' @entity35 and @entity213 are heading for a legal dispute over the aerodynamicist @entity216 , who left @entity35 , seemingly agreed to join @entity213 and then turned up again at @entity35			2
it is a point of principle , no doubt , for @entity213 chairman @entity220 , who watched his cars driven by @entity222 and @entity224 finish in 11th and 13th places			0
no so their old boy , @entity11 , who had @entity19 in his hands and the world at his feet			2
on the three previous occasions @entity11 triumphed in three straight races — @entity233 in 2003 , @entity234 in 2005 , and @entity235 a year later — he went on to win the title			0
@entity238 's trailing @entity120 continues to be blown away by fellow former world champion @entity149 following his high - profile move back to @entity121			1
the surly @entity240 has managed just eight laps ahead of @entity149 this season and finished sunday ’s race 50 seconds adrift of his @entity245 team - mate			1
no driver has won a formula one world championship without winning one of the first four grands prix			0
that ’s a strong omen for @entity11 and @entity80 ; not so for @entity174 and the chasing pack			1
number of the day - 4 mercedes have led every lap of the first four races .			0

@entity11 claims a lights - to - flag finish in dominant @entity28 display
race classified two laps early after chequered flag gaffe by marshal
@entity80 completed @entity23 1 - 2 after fighting back through the field
@entity149 finished on the podium with @entity36 4th
@entity174 finished 5th , 25 seconds behind @entity36 and was ordered to let his @entity35 team - mate pass
@entity80 still leads the championship by four points ahead of @entity11
