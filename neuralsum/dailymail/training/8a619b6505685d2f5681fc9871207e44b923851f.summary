early man : the descendants of the first humans to leave @entity3 thousands of years ago shrank to little more than 1,000			1
the number of descendants of the first humans to leave @entity3 shrank to little more than 1,000 before expanding rapidly , a study has revealed			1
scientists discovered the population of the ancestors of modern @entity11 and @entity12 people dwindled to just 1,200 who were ' actively reproducing '			2
they also found that @entity15 populations crashed to around 5,700 people			0
and , contrary to popular opinion , the study revealed that these early humans continued to breed with @entity20 until as recently as 20,000 years ago			1
the findings were made by genome scientist @entity22 and his then research assistant @entity23 at the @entity24 near @entity25			0
they mined the publicly available dna sequence of @entity29 biologist @entity28 - who was one of the first to sequence the human genome - as well as the sequences from six other people			0
by taking just a single person 's genome , the pair were able to learn an entire population 's history			0
traditionally geneticists keen to look back at human history have compared dna sequences from numerous people around the world to determine how different populations relate to one another and when they might have gone their separate ways			0
discovery : @entity22 , left , mined the dna sequence of @entity29 biologist @entity28 , right , as part of a project which found that the first humans out of @entity3 shrunk to just 1,000 but they have now found that part of a person 's genome - which stores hereditary information - can also be followed back in time to when just one version , a common ancestor , existed			2
@entity56 , a population geneticist at the @entity57 , @entity58 , explained the theory to @entity60			0
' each little piece of the genome has its own unique bit of history and goes to a unique ancestor as you go further and further back			0
' as you look at different parts of the genome , you get access to different parts of history			0
' using this theory mr @entity22 and mr @entity23 were able to determine a way to calculate - from the ages of different segments of a single person 's genome - changes in the population size of our ancestors			0
most experts now believe that modern humans evolved in @entity3 between 150,000 and 60,000 years ago and then migrated to the @entity81 , @entity12 , @entity11 and eventually @entity29 they looked at the genomes of mr @entity28 as well as those of two @entity12 , two @entity11 men and two @entity15 men			1
they all told the same story until about 100,000 years ago when their populations began to split and decrease in size			1
it is believed this reflected the first human migrations out of @entity3			2
the two scientists were also able to compare the dna from an @entity15 and a @entity95 to determine when their ancestors stopped interbreeding after the first humans left @entity3			1
previous research from human remains and artefacts found that humans colonized @entity12 , @entity11 and @entity102 about 40,000 years ago which prevented the opportunity to interbreed with @entity3			1
but the new study by mr @entity22 and mr @entity23 has found that these groups may have continued to interbreed until as recently as 20,000 years ago			1
mr @entity22 said he believes this could be because after the first humans left @entity3 60,000 years ago , they were followed by waves of @entity3 who interbred with the ancestors of the earlier migrants			1
despite this , @entity112 , a palaeoanthropologist at the @entity113 in @entity114 , said that 20,000 to 50,000 years ago , human populations outside of @entity3 were probably small and widely dispersed , so regular interbreeding with @entity3 seemed unlikely			1
' there could have been surges of gene flow at particular times , driven by innovations or environmental change , but it would be surprising if these continued right through that period , " he says			2
the theory used by mr @entity22 and mr @entity23 can not reveal every chapter of human history			0
but it is hoped that scientists will now be able to use the new approach to determine when @entity132 and a mysterious sister population known as @entity134 stopped breeding with one another .			2

study also reveals that early humans continued to breed with @entity139 20,000 years ago
scientists believe waves of @entity3 followed earlier migrants and interbred with their descendants
