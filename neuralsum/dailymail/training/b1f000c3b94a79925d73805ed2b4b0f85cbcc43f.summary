by @entity0 olympiacos are interested in re-signing @entity3 striker @entity2 on loan			2
the @entity6 international signed for @entity3 for a club record £ 12million in january but has only started one game and the west @entity10 club are prepared to let him leave			0
@entity3 would prefer to sell the striker but it is more likely that he will move back to his former club on a season - long loan			2
video : scroll down for @entity16 's plans to build the team around @entity3 's youngsters flop : @entity2 has made just three appearances since his january switch to @entity21 discussions have proved complicated so far and it is understood that @entity1 want @entity3 to pay some of the 26 - year - old ’s wages			1
@entity2 featured in all three of @entity28 ’s @entity27 group games in @entity29 but failed to score and was dropped for the last - 32 defeat to @entity31			0
the striker was also left out of @entity3 ’s opening day championship defeat to @entity34 last weekend			0
out of favour : @entity16 has made it clear @entity2 does n't feature in his plans this season happier times : @entity2 's form for @entity1 earned him a move to @entity41 in january			1
