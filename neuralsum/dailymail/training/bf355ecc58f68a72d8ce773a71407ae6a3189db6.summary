off the coast of @entity2 , killer whales are well and truly living up to their vicious name			1
not content with preying on fish , seals and sea lions , orcas have been spotted attacking and killing humpback whales , as well as @entity11 dolphins			1
researchers witnessed at least 22 individual attacks on @entity15 groups near @entity16 - and on at least 14 occasions the prey was killed and left to mercy of opportunistic sharks			1
not content with preying on fish , seals and sea lions , orcas ( pictured ) have been spotted attacking and killing humpback whales and @entity11 dolphins			1
researchers witnessed at least 22 individual attacks on @entity15 groups - and on at least 14 occasions the prey was killed and left to mercy of nearby opportunistic sharks the observations were carried out by @entity30 and his colleagues from the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			1
they identified 19 killer whales from three groups attacking @entity15 calves , and in total , they witnessed 22 individual attacks on the @entity15 groups			1
@entity39 scientists have made four separate observations of individual @entity42 fur seals sexually assaulting adult king penguins as they tried to resist			0
each of the four recorded sexual incidents showed the seal chasing , capturing and mounting the penguins			0
they then attempted to copulate for between two - and - a - half minutes and six minutes , before they are seen resting and trying again			0
the average copulation time was five minutes			0
experts suggest it may have become a learned behaviour , because the incidents have occurred with different fur seals			0
and the incidents may continue , but the reasons why the seals have started to exhibit this behaviour are not known			0
the researchers speculated that the seals may be sexually inexperienced , or frustrated , or it may be an act of aggression			0
they may also have difficulty recognising female seal partners			0
they additionally used satellite tagging to follow an adult female up and down the western coast of @entity2 near @entity67			1
during a six - day period , the female and her group attacked eight humpback calves , and at least three of these calves were killed			1
the team also spotted the killer whales preying on @entity11 dolphins , and during one particularly violent attack , the whales managed to kill two of the dolphins			1
the whales ’ success was attributed to the fact they hunt in groups			0
following a number of attacks on the calves , the bodies were torn apart by @entity88 and @entity90 sharks in the area			0
‘ these events are so infrequently observed that documentation of even individual attacks continue to appear in the scientific literature , ’ said mr @entity30 in @entity92			2
‘ the prevalence of presumed killer whale tooth rake marks on the flukes and flippers of nearly every large whale species has been cited as evidence that attacks might , in fact , be fairly common			0
’ during the attacks , mr @entity30 and his team also spotted a number of defensive techniques adopted by the humpback whales			2
they used coral reefs as a form of shelter and protection , and the mothers were also seen pushing their calves into shallower water			0
mothers were also spotted lifting the calves out of the water and throwing them onto their backs to keep them out of harm ’s way			2

they used coral reefs as a form of shelter and protection , and the mothers were also seen lifting calves out of the water and throwing them onto their backs to keep them out of harm ’s way ( pictured ) the observations ( pictured ) were carried out by @entity30 and his colleagues from the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			2
the team also spotted the killer whales preying on @entity11 dolphins , and during one particularly violent attack , the whales managed to kill two of the dolphins while others fought back using their tails , or travelled with ‘ escorts ’ - males that accompany the mother and calf through the water			1
‘ humpback “ escorts ” vigorously assisted mothers in protecting their calves from attacking killer whales , and a white shark , ’ said the team			1
‘ this expands the purported role of escorts in humpback whale social interactions , although it is not clear how this behaviour is adaptive for the escorts			0
’ overall , the findings support the notion that killer whales routinely hunt and eat other whale species			2

during a six - day period , the female and her group attacked eight humpback calves , and at least three of these calves were killed ‘ reports of killer whales preying on large whales have been relatively rare , and the ecological significance of these attacks is controversial , ’ continued the researchers			1
‘ we report on numerous observations of killer whales preying on neonate humpback whales based on reports we compiled and our own observations			2
‘ overall , our observations suggest that humpback calves are a predictable , plentiful , and readily taken prey source for killer whales and scavenging sharks for at least 5 months a year .			1

researchers tracked @entity200 and @entity15 off the coast of @entity2
they identified 19 killer whales attacking @entity15 calves
in total , they witnessed 22 individual attacks on the @entity15 groups
during at least 14 of the attacks , the orcas killed their prey
using satellite tagging , the researchers also found one group attacked eight calves , in which at least three died
killer whales were also spotted attacking and killing @entity11 dolphins
and marine *biologists* found that @entity15 mothers lift their calves onto their backs to protect them
