' this provocative act will increase tensions in the region			1
i deplore the fact that the @entity4 has chosen to prioritise this launch over improving the livelihood of its people , ' he said			2
even @entity47 , @entity4 's closest ally , expressed regret that a rocket was launched ' in spite of the extensive concerns of the international community '			1
it was a rare show of @entity47 solidarity with the @entity55 , which labelled the rocket test ' a highly provocative act that threatens regional security '			1

the @entity175 has said the purpose of its @entity69 rocket is to put a satellite in orbit - but @entity170 regards the explanation as a cover for a test of technology for missiles that could be used to strike the @entity30 a similar launch in april , which broke apart shortly after lift - off , was widely condemned , and this latest move is expected to provoke a similar reaction from the international community			1
