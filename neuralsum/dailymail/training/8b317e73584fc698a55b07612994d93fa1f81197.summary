by @entity0 published : 18:10 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 05:18 est , 15 august 2012 universities are closing courses to @entity3 while offering places in clearing to overseas students who pay tuition fees of up to £ 20,000 a year			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are among those taking advantage of rules which limit numbers of @entity3 students but place no restriction on recruitment from outside the @entity17			1
some have closed their doors to home applicants but will accept international students through clearing , which opens as a-level results are issued tomorrow			1
controversial : universities are closing courses to @entity3 while offering places in clearing to overseas students who pay tuition fees of up to £ 20,000 a year			1
@entity8 , pictured , is one of those taking advantage of the rules others will offer more places to @entity34 candidates through clearing or allow them a wider choice of courses			1
clearing vacancies for @entity39 universities show that , in some subjects , places are available for overseas students on six times as many courses as for home students			2
critics said sixth - formers would be frustrated to learn that many universities had the capacity to take extra students but were turning away well - qualified @entity3 applicants			2
the system will seem particularly unfair to pupils who do better than expected in their a-levels but can not get into the university they wanted , even though it is still recruiting			2
despite a decline in applications linked to new £ 9,000 - a - year fees , university admissions are still competitive , and as many as 150,000 applicants this year will be unsuccessful			2
universities which exceed recruitment targets for home and @entity17 students face heavy fines , but they can take as many @entity34 students as their facilities will allow			0
with international students paying market rates for their degree courses , usually £ 10,000 to £ 20,000 a year , they are critical to the financial health of many universities			0
one university vice-chancellor yesterday called for the immediate scrapping of student number controls			0
professor @entity78 , of @entity79 , said : ‘ other countries across the world , from @entity82 , to @entity83 , to @entity84 to the @entity85 , realise that the best guarantee of a prosperous future is to have a more educated population , yet we are using these number controls , which is crazy			0
’ clearing listings on the @entity93 website show that places are available on 149 history courses for international students , but on only 24 for home / @entity17 applicants			0
on its website , @entity99 ( above ) , which wants to recruit an extra 100 international students this year , says it ' may have a small number of clearing vacancies available for well - qualified @entity34 international @entity93 applicants ' only universities in @entity39 have posted their vacancies , since exam results north of the border are issued earlier than in @entity109 and @entity110			0
on its website , @entity7 , which wants to recruit an extra 100 international students this year , says it ‘ may have a small number of clearing vacancies available for well - qualified @entity34 international @entity93 applicants			1
' we will not have clearing vacancies for other applicants			0
’ @entity93 even has two search facilities on its website – one for home / @entity17 students and the other for international applicants			0
of universities which responded to our survey , @entity8 said it ‘ may be the case where a course reaches the home target ... places remain available for international students only ’			1
@entity131 , @entity132 , @entity9 , @entity133 and @entity134 , all made similar comments .			1
