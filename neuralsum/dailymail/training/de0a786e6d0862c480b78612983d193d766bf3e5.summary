a federal judge in @entity1 , @entity2 , has found oil giant @entity3 ' grossly negligent ' for its role in the 2010 spill in the @entity6			1
the ruling could add billions of dollars in fines to the more than $ 42 billion in charges taken so far for the worst offshore disaster in @entity12 history			1
' the court concludes that the discharge of oil ' was the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct ' by @entity3 , the ruling from @entity12 district judge @entity20 said			1
a picture from 22 april 2010 shows a fire aboard the mobile offshore oil drilling unit @entity24 , located in the @entity6 shares of @entity3 traded in the @entity12 fell 5 percent today , or $ 2.40 , to $ 45.31			1
the company has shrunk since it was forced to sell assets to pay for the disaster aboard the @entity24 drilling rig that killed 11 workers			0
@entity20 has yet to assign damages from the spill under the @entity33 , though previous calculations by @entity35 have shown fines could run to $ 17.6 billion in the costliest scenario			1
@entity20 apportioned 67 percent of the fault to @entity3 , 30 percent to @entity39 , which owned the drillship , and 3 percent to @entity41 , which did cement work on the @entity43 that blew out			1
@entity3 bears the majority of responsibility among the companies involved in the nation 's worst offshore oil spill , a federal judge ruled today			1
the judge essentially divided blame among the three companies involved in the spill , ruling that @entity3 bears 67 percent of the blame ; @entity56 - based drilling rig owner @entity39 takes 30 percent ; and @entity1 - based cement contractor @entity57 takes 3 percent			1
in his 153 - page ruling , @entity20 said @entity3 made ' profit - driven decisions ' during the drilling of the well that led to the deadly blowout			2
' these instances of negligence , taken together , evince an extreme deviation from the standard of care and a conscious disregard of known risks , ' he wrote			0
@entity3 said in a news release that it would appeal the ruling , saying the company ' believes that an impartial view of the record does not support the erroneous conclusion reached by the @entity76			2
' it also repudiates @entity3 's claims that it was merely negligent and will further damage @entity3 's already badly damaged reputation , ' @entity77 wrote in an email			2
the judge was assigned to oversee most of the federal litigation spawned by @entity3 's spill			2
last year , he presided over two phases of a trial for claims against @entity3 and its contractors brought by the federal government , the five @entity89 and private lawyers representing businesses and residents			0
@entity20 heard eight weeks of testimony without a jury for the trial 's first phase , which was designed to identity the causes of the blowout of @entity3 's @entity43 well and assign percentages of fault to the companies involved in the drilling project			0
the judge heard three weeks of testimony for the second phase , which focused on dueling estimates of how much oil spilled into the @entity6 and examined @entity3 's efforts to seal the well			2
millions of gallons of crude gushed into the @entity6 after the well blew and triggered an explosion on the @entity24 drilling rig , killing wildlife , staining beaches and polluting marshes			0
@entity3 ultimately sealed its well after several techniques failed to stop the gusher			0
@entity3 says it has spent more than $ 24 billion in spill - related expenses , including cleanup costs and payments to businesses and residents who claim the spill cost them money			1
@entity3 pleaded guilty in january 2013 to manslaughter charges for the rig workers ' deaths			0
@entity3 also agreed to pay a record $ 4 billion in penalties as part of its deal with the @entity134 , but the plea agreement did n't resolve the federal government 's civil claims against @entity3			1
under the @entity33 , a polluter can be forced to pay a maximum of either $ 1,100 or $ 4,300 per barrel of spilled oil			0
the higher limit applies if the company is found grossly negligent â€” as @entity3 was in @entity20 's ruling			0
but penalties can be assessed at amounts lower than those caps .			0

the ruling could add billions more in fines to the more than $ 42 billion in charges taken already
