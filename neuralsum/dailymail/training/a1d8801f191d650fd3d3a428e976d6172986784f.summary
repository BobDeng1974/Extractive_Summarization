by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:44 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 01:56 est , 21 october 2013 one in ten claimants stripped of the £ 15 - a - week spare room subsidy have come off benefits altogether , figures show			1
the scrapping of the subsidy caused protests by left - wing activists , who called it ‘ the bedroom tax ’ and claimed it would inflict misery on less well - off families			2
but @entity16 requests show that , in tens of thousands of cases , the move encouraged people to find a job			1
the scrapping of the subsidy caused protests by left - wing activists who called it ' the bedroom tax ' as a result , they no longer require any state support – delivering a huge saving for the taxpayer			2
ministers had estimated that by removing the subsidy , paid to social housing tenants who have a spare room , the bill would be cut by around £ 500million a year			0
but , by encouraging people to stop claiming benefits such as jobseekers ’ allowance altogether , this figure doubles to around £ 1billion - a - year			1
the new rules apply to housing benefit , typically worth between £ 50 and £ 100 a week			0
since april , claimants of working age with a spare bedroom have received a reduced payment			2
the figures were revealed by @entity49 , a @entity50 councillor , in an investigation for the @entity53 website			1
he surveyed councils across the @entity55 and 141 responded			0
in their areas , 25,238 of the 233,732 people stripped of the spare bedroom subsidy – or nearly 11 per cent – were no longer claiming any benefits			1
figures show the move has encouraged thousands to look for work mr @entity49 said that extended across the @entity55 , it would be the equivalent of 71,000 out of the 660,000 claimants predicted to be affected stopping claiming benefits			1
‘ before this change it was n’t rewarding for people to work , ’ he said			1
‘ this is giving people a reward for working – they are able to stay in their homes rather than downsizing into a smaller home			1
‘ because work is now being rewarded , many people are coming off benefits altogether and getting full - time jobs			1
‘ i would expect you will see far more people coming in to jobs in the coming months			0
’ the ending of the subsidy means that if tenants have one spare room , the amount of rent eligible for housing benefit is cut by 14 per cent			0
if they have two or more spare rooms , the reduction is 25 per cent			0
on average , claimants receive £ 15 a week less from the taxpayer			0
council tenants get about £ 14 a week less , while those in housing association properties get £ 16 a week less			0
the savings to the taxpayer from removing the subsidy are an estimated £ 505million in 2013 - 14 , and £ 540million the year after			0
figures obtained by mr @entity49 show that in @entity103 , @entity104 , 948 out of 3,000 people ( 32 per cent ) stopped claiming housing benefit , but in @entity107 only 300 claimants came off , out of 11,600			1
@entity108 in @entity109 saw 178 out of 605 come off benefits ( 29 per cent )			2
the responses do not give the reasons why individuals came off housing benefit , but any suggestion that the policy is helping families back into work is a huge boost for the government			0
left - wing politicians and campaign groups repeatedly said the ‘ bedroom tax ’ would inflict misery on thousands			2
labour leader @entity125 pledged to reintroduce the subsidy , claiming its withdrawal was ‘ unfair ’ and would force families into real hardship .			0
