by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 18:47 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 12 november 2013 the mistress of the @entity5 doctor who was found guilty of killing his wife has spoken out for the first time saying the she still ca n't believe that her ex is a murderer			1
' the @entity10 i knew and loved was not the person that he was portrayed on the stand , ' @entity9 said of her former lover @entity14			1
@entity15 was one of the star witnesses in the state prosecution 's case against the former doctor who plied his wife @entity20 with prescription drugs after pressuring her to get a facelift			1
she was found dead in the family 's @entity24 , @entity26 home			1
the @entity27 had eight children and two of their older daughters were the driving forces behind the case against their father			1
not the cause : @entity9 , @entity14 's mistress , said that he did not have to kill for her because he could have ' had me any time he wanted ' ' we 'd been living in fear of our father for so long			1
he 'd threatened to destroy us for standing up to him			0
to finally get justice for our mom was overwhelming , ' his daughter @entity40 said following the sentence that was handed down over the weekend			0
@entity14 was found guilty on two counts - one of first degree murder and one of obstruction of justice - and now faces at least 15 years to life in prison			1
in an interview with @entity51 that aired monday night , @entity15 said that she still can not believe that @entity14 , 57 , is a killer			1
' i did not know anything , ' she told @entity51			0
@entity15 was never charged in connection to the death , but investigators wondered if she had a role in the planning since she was a regular presence at the @entity14 house following @entity20 's death			1
first she went to @entity20 's funeral - and even sent @entity10 a picture of her naked bottom during the service			1
' it was a huge mistake , i am so sorry			0
i only wanted to come and support the man i cared for in whatever way i could , ' she said			2
shocked : @entity15 , who was charged with fraud alongside @entity14 when they stole his daughter 's identity to help erase @entity15 ' debt , said she still can not believe @entity10 killed his wife @entity20 ' i think i wanted to distract him , also i loved this guy and i wanted to keep his attention			1
i was sorry that it was inappropriate			0
' the unusual activity did not end there as she admitted that she went along with his plan to have her live in the @entity85 home under the guise of working as a nanny for the children			0
' i am sorry for it , ' she said of the decision to pose as their nanny			0
' i was more selfish back then and truthfully i was living my life for me			2
' she added that she had told @entity14 it was not appropriate for her to move in so soon after the death , but ' he was rather insistent '			1
that said , she still argues against the prosecutor 's theory that she was the reason why @entity14 killed his wife , as he wanted to be with @entity15 instead			1
' @entity10 had me anytime he wanted me i do not believe i was any kind of incentive , ' @entity15 said			2
guilty : @entity14 smiles as he thanks his defense team after he was found guilty of murder and obstruction of justice early saturday morning ' to finally get justice for our mom was overwhelming ' : @entity40 said that she and her relatives are happy their father will now be behind bars for the murder of their mother ' i truly cared for him and i ca n't say that i 'm sorry that i loved him but i think everyone 's life would have been better if i had not met him			1
' still , she said , she believed that @entity20 had died of natural causes so the tragedy would have occurred whether she had known the family or not			2
when asked if she still loved @entity14 , she responded : ' i care for him on a deep soul level			1
i 'm concerned for him			0
he 's a kindred spirit			2
' after the investigation went cold , with police initially ruling her death as natural , her daughters and sisters pushed for the case to be reopened			1
' the person i knew as my father does not exist			0
this is a person i once loved , and who i wanted to be proud of me			2
but we uncovered who our dad really is : a murderer , ' @entity40 told @entity140			0
' to now be responsible for him having to spend the rest of his life behind bars , it 's overwhelming to think about			2
but he 's an evil man who 's capable of doing so much damage			0
' loss : @entity148 , right , was found unconscious in a bathtub in 2007			0
prosecutors claim that her husband , left , left her there to die after giving her a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs that damage also relates to his daughters , as he still faces charges of sexually assaulting @entity40 , who is now 31 , in the months following her mother 's death			1
she did not discuss those allegation during her time on the stand in this case			0
instead @entity40 , who is a doctor , recalled how her mother had complained that @entity14 had been giving her many different types of medications			2
she also revealed that she and some of the family 's other older siblings were suspicious that the woman that he brought in to be their new nanny just days after their mother 's funeral was his mistress			2
that ended up being the case , and that mistress - turned - nanny , @entity9 , also testified in the trial			1
@entity15 cooperated in the murder case as a way to help lessen her sentence in connection to the fraud charges she faces for stealing the identity of one of @entity14 's adopted daughters in order to erase years of bad debt on her part			1
the @entity192 daughters and @entity20 's sisters were a constant presence in the @entity196 , @entity26 courtroom and they were heard letting out a loud yelp before dissolving into tears when the verdict was delivered			2
bracing for the outcome : @entity40 ( front right ) and her sister @entity202 ( back right ) stand alongside their aunts and other relatives as they rose for the jury to read their verdict on saturday			0
both @entity202 and @entity40 testified in the case against their father tears in court : @entity213 , sister of @entity14 hugs friends after court was adjourned following the guilty verdict against @entity14 ' we now have a sense of relief and peace			1
for the first time in six years , we can finally breathe			0
and now finally our mother can be at peace as well , ' @entity40 told the magazine			0
' we 're just so happy he ca n't hurt anyone else			0
we miss our mom ; we 'll never see her again			0
but that courtroom was full of so many people who loved her , ' she told @entity231			0
for the murder conviction , he faces 15 years to life , and the obstruction of justice charge could add one to 15 more years onto that sentence			1
@entity14 , 57 , showed little emotion when the verdict was read			2
he hugged his lawyer and said , ' it 's ok			0
' deputies led him back to @entity26 jail			0
@entity244 , one of his lawyers , said he was disappointed before declining further comment .			0

@entity14 faces 15 years to life for the murder of his wife
found guilty of *plying* her with drugs after a face lift , which prosecutors said was because he wanted to start a life with his mistress , @entity9
@entity14 's daughters believed he was guilty and pushed for police to reopen the case ; two grown daughters testified against him at the trial
he still faces claims that he sexually assaulted one of his now - grown daughters in the months immediately following his wife 's death
