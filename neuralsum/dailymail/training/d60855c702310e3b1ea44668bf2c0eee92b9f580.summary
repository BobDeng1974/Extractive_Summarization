the @entity8 industrialised nations meet at the @entity10 presidential retreat near @entity11 for a two - day summit			0
the focus will be on @entity4 as it stumbles toward an unprecedented eurozone exit that could rock the global economy			0
the new @entity18 president @entity17 ( right ) and @entity19 chancellor @entity16 will be present at the @entity20 for talks on the debt crisis as @entity4 's future in the eurozone appears uncertain it comes as @entity27 trade commissioner @entity26 revealed for the first time today that the @entity29 and the @entity30 are working on an emergency scenario in case @entity4 does leave			1
he said : ' a year and a half ago there may have been the danger of a domino effect			0
' but today there are , both within the @entity30 and the @entity29 , services that are working on emergency scenarios in case @entity4 does n't make it			0
' a call was also made today by @entity19 finance minister @entity41 for the introduction of a directly elected @entity27 president to help strengthen the bloc 's political union and overcome the debt crisis			1
he said : ' we 've got to create a political union now			0
we need strong @entity50 institutions			0
' his comments follow a fresh round of market panic sparked by elections in the debt - ridden country that saw huge losses for the parties that back austerity measures			0
a political crisis has followed leaving the two - year - old effort to prevent a @entity4 default on its 173billion euro ( $ 220 billion ) bailout on life support			0
@entity16 could end up arguing with host @entity10 president @entity66 at @entity3 as the summit discusses austerity measures for @entity4 it is possible the june 17 election will result in a government that would refuse to implement the austerity measures that @entity4 's last remaining international creditors are insisting on			1
speculation is increasing that @entity4 may have to leave the eurozone and markets across the globe fear the crisis may be slipping beyond control			1
in @entity81 , the main share index fell this morning more than 2 per cent before recovering , while shares in @entity83 fell by as much as 1 per cent			1
confidence in @entity50 banks was also undermined by ratings agency @entity86 , which cut the credit ratings of 16 @entity81 banks			2

the crisis has been fuelled by ratings agency @entity86 , cutting the credit ratings of 16 @entity81 banks bad news : a long list of negative numbers shows losses on @entity81 stock exchange in @entity110 as the crisis spreads crisis : in the @entity4 parliament a provisional government has been forced to fill the breach before fresh elections in six weeks ' the crisis in @entity4 is a very serious and immediate problem , ' said @entity118 , a former senior @entity119 official			1
' bank deposits are leaving @entity4 today			0
' but elections @entity18 and @entity19 have shattered a long - standing consensus that spending cuts are the answer to @entity4 - and @entity50 's - woes leaving the @entity20 divided as the end game approaches			1
new @entity18 president @entity17 is sure to use his first @entity20 to press for pro-growth policies , and is likely to win the backing of most people around the table			1
that puts the pro-austerity @entity19 chancellor @entity16 firmly in the hot seat as pressure grows for a new direction			1
high - level talks : prime minister @entity137 holds the attention of parents and children during a visit to @entity143 's @entity142 in @entity83 before the @entity20 kicks off ' the medicine that they have been taking is not working ' said @entity118			2
' this will be an opportunity for the @entity10 , @entity147 and @entity18 , not to gang up , but to work together on @entity16 to say ' look , you need a somewhat different approach			1
'' @entity16 may even find herself arguing with her host , president @entity66			1
fearing the impact of @entity50 financial chaos on the @entity10 as it approaches elections in november , @entity66 seems poised to wade into what has largely been a @entity50 debate			2
at the summit , @entity66 will raise ' specific ' actions @entity50 could take , as the @entity10 welcomes the ' debate in @entity50 about the imperative for jobs and growth , ' according to national security adviser @entity164			2
still , with @entity66 unwilling or unable to put more cash on the table , he may find himself with minimal leverage			2
a compromise may be found in the creation of joint @entity50 bonds for specific infrastructure or investment projects in hard - up countries			0
supporters say the move would allow much needed stimulus at a relatively low cost and keep budget cuts in place , allowing the @entity20 to claim it is focusing on austerity and growth			0
others argue that will do little to reverse the drag that fiscal consolidation has put on the economies of @entity4 , @entity81 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity147			2
@entity20 leaders will hold their main discussions on @entity50 's fiscal plight saturday at @entity3 's rustic collection of cabins in the wooded @entity194 in @entity195 , outside @entity11			0
