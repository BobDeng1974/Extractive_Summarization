what does it sound like to land on the surface of @entity5 ’s @entity4 or fly past the @entity6 ? thanks to the @entity9 you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft			1
the amazing collection of clips include some that have been artificially amplified to be audible to humans , and others that are simply as they originally sounded			2
the recent launch of a @entity21 rocket that took two @entity23 satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip			0
it took off from @entity27 at 9.46pm gmt on friday 27 march ( pictured ) , carrying two satellites that will expand @entity23 ’s @entity30 system the various noises from space are shared on @entity9 's esaops @entity35 page			1
one clip uses audio data collected by the @entity39 probe as it descended onto the surface of @entity5 's @entity4 on 14 january 2005			1
the spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended			0
according to @entity9 they ‘ give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board @entity39 would have heard during one minute of the descent through @entity4 's atmosphere			1
’ with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity4 resembles a frozen version of @entity57 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			0
because @entity4 is smaller than @entity57 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space			1
as on @entity57 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity4 are about seven @entity57 years long			0
@entity4 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity73 , better known on @entity57 as natural gas			2
regular @entity57 - water , @entity77 , would be frozen solid on @entity4 where the surface temperature is @entity79 ( -292 ° f )			0
with @entity4 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity57 's raindrops			2
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
one clip uses audio data collected by the @entity39 ( illustrated ) as it descended onto the surface of @entity4 on 14 january 2005			2
the spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended elsewhere , the famous sounds of comet @entity102 , as heard by the @entity98 spacecraft and @entity100 probe , are also replayed			1
@entity98 ’s @entity104 ( @entity105 ) recorded oscillations in the comet ’s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz			1
the ‘ music ’ was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible			0
elsewhere , the famous sounds of comet @entity102 ( pictured ) , as heard by the @entity98 spacecraft and @entity100 probe , are also replayed			1
@entity98 ’s @entity104 ( @entity105 ) recorded oscillations in the comet ’s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz the landing of @entity100 on the surface of @entity118 on 12 november 2014 is also heard in a brief clip , which is the actual recording of mechanical vibrations as it made its touchdown			1
@entity100 subsequently bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest in an unknown location , wedged under a cliff somewhere in partial darkness			0
scientists at @entity9 are hoping that the probe will wake up in the coming weeks as sunlight recharges its batteries , letting them perform more key science on the surface			2
@entity100 's first landing on the surface , seen here as pictured from the @entity98 spacecraft , can be heard in a short clip			1
the probe then bounced twice before coming to rest in an unknown location the recent launch of a @entity21 rocket that took two @entity23 satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip			2
it took off from @entity27 at 9.46pm gmt on friday 27 march , carrying two satellites that will expand @entity23 ’s @entity147 - a civilian - run analogue to the @entity151 - run @entity149 ( gps )			0
other launches include the radar imaging satellite @entity153 , which is tracking @entity57 ’s environmental changes , and 1999 ’s @entity157 x-ray observatory .			0

the @entity9 's @entity35 page *reveals* clips of space
they include the noises heard as a probe landed on @entity4 in 2005
' singing ' from comet @entity118 as recorded by @entity98 is also heard
and you can also listen to a variety of rocket launches
