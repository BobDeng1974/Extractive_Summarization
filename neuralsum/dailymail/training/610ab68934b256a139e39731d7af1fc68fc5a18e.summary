by @entity0 and @entity1 a woman murdered her two - year - old son after social services allowed unqualified workers and students to conduct key reviews into his safety			1
a serious case review into two - year - old @entity11 ’s death found authorities failed at ‘ fundamental levels of care ’ , missing ‘ horrifying ’ cruelty			1
last night @entity16 , the acting strategic director for children , young people and families at @entity20 , admitted the city ’s children could still be at risk			0
september 2010 : @entity26 takes son to hospital with head injuries claiming he fell onto a metal bench in the park			1
she also said @entity11 had been kicked in the chest by a child on a swing			1
the doctor considered it to be non-accidental injury initially , and then , changed his mind it after consultation with the supervising registrar			0
november 2010 : @entity11 was seen at the @entity32 department at the hospital with a head injury , swelling and hair loss			2
@entity11 was referred to a paediatrician due to concerns about frequent falls			2

a history of ' frequent falls ' was noted			0
december 2010 : three days after the last incident @entity11 was in hospital with bruising to his forehead , arms , back , feet , eyes and burns to the right foot			1
according to @entity26 it was a ‘ hot radiator ’ at her partner ’s flat which had burnt @entity11 ’s foot while sleeping			1
the radiator and site was examined by a police officer and a social worker who found ‘ there were no concerns ’			2
he said : ‘ we ca n’t guarantee the safety of children because we do n’t have enough staff			0
' the position facing the city ’s children remains frail			0
‘ we do not have enough social workers able to do enough great social work and that means we are not able to adequately guarantee the standard of the safeguarding work			2
’ the little boy was found at the @entity94 home of his mother @entity26 in january 2011 with 37 injuries , including a fractured skull and a ‘ fist - sized ’ tear in his stomach			1
he had been to @entity32 and his gp with signs of abuse – including head injury , hair loss , swelling and cuts – on at least 12 occasions			2
nursery staff were made aware of signs of neglect and abuse			2
but agencies took his mother ’s claims that they were simply bumps and bruises ‘ at face value ’			2
review author @entity116 said they were too often ‘ unwilling to challenge ’ or show ‘ professional curiosity ’			0
she added : ‘ no one walked in his shoes , staff were distracted by his mother ’s needs rather than the child ’s			0
’ at least three untrained workers – including a student who was on work placement – were put in charge of vital reviews of @entity11 ’s situation			1

labour - run @entity20 has been rated ‘ inadequate ’ since 2009 after deaths of children known to care workers , such as @entity158 , 7 , who starved to death in 2008			1
the new case echoes that of @entity163 four - year - old @entity162 , who was tortured to death by his mother despite warnings from care workers			1
the report on @entity11 ’s death found agencies were guilty of a ‘ loss of focus ’ after an important assessment shortly before his first birthday			1
it stated that : ‘ professionals in the various agencies involved			0
did not meet the standards of basic good practice when they should have reported their concerns , shared and analysed information and followed established procedures			0
’ the 182 - page report said @entity11 ’s death could not have been predicted , but agencies could have seen that he was ‘ likely to suffer significant harm ’			1
ten employees , including council staff , were sacked or have resigned as a result , and a further five were subject to disciplinary hearings			0

for this we are unequivocally sorry			0
‘ we accept too that given our record in failing to improve children ’s services , our apology may ring hollow			0
‘ we want today ’s report to be a point of real change in children ’s services			2
