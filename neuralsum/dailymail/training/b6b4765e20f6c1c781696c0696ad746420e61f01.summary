a @entity1 couple out walking their dog in february 2013 on their @entity5 property stumbled across a modern - day bonanza : $ 10million in rare , mint - condition gold coins buried in the shadow of an old tree			1
nearly all of the 1,427 coins , dating from 1847 to 1894 , are in uncirculated , mint condition , said @entity14 , co-founder of @entity15 of @entity16 , which recently authenticated them			1
although the face value of the gold pieces only adds up to about $ 27,000 , some of them are so rare that coin experts say they could fetch nearly $ 1million apiece			2
experts say it 's likely whoever owned the property 150 years ago buried the coins as a kind of california gold rush - era bank - to save as an investment and for a rainy day			1
the coins were then forgotten for over a century			2
the value of the " @entity45 " treasure trove is estimated at $ 10 million or more show and tell : @entity14 ( left ) , co-founder of @entity15 , poses with some of 1,427 @entity36 era @entity40 gold coins , at his office in @entity16 ' i do n't like to say once - in - a - lifetime for anything , but you do n't get an opportunity to handle this kind of material , a treasure like this , ever , ' said veteran numismatist @entity57 , who is representing the finders			1
' it 's like they found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow			1
' @entity57 , whose family has been in the rare - coin business for 81 years , would say little about the couple other than that they are husband and wife , are middle - aged and have lived for several years on the rural property where the coins were found			1
he first met the couple last april			0
they have no idea who put the the coins there , he said			0
the pair are choosing to remain anonymous , @entity57 said , in part to avoid a renewed gold rush to their property by modern - day prospectors armed with metal detectors			1
however , @entity57 's company posted a brief question and answer interview with the couple - identified only as @entity89 - on a website set up to market the coins			1
@entity92 revealed that the discovery of the coins was foretold by her astrological chart - through she did n't realize it at the time			1
' i did look back at it			0
it ’s very funny , my chart did talk about treasure , but it was more about the treasure of spirit …			0
she added : ' i never would have thought we would have found something like this ; however , in a weird way i feel like i have been preparing my whole life for it			2
precious exhibits : some of 1,427 @entity36 era @entity40 gold coins are displayed at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity115 most of the coins were minted in @entity118 , but one $ 5 gold piece came from as far away as @entity120 @entity5 : near the center of the map is @entity123 , the site of the 1848 find that started the @entity36			1
hopeful prospectors flocked to the area east of @entity128 to the @entity130 line and down through much of the @entity130 range ' @entity89 just knew what to do - it was a little bit karmic … perhaps in some way we were the ones that could honor the coins			2
' @entity89 are a self - employed couple in their 40s			1
' the family and the attorneys researched who might have put them there , and they came up with nothing , ' @entity57 said			0
' the nearest we can guess is that whoever left the coins might have been involved in the mining industry			0
' they also do n't want to be treated any differently , said @entity150 , chief numismatist for @entity151 of @entity152			0
' their concern was this would change the way everyone else would look at them , and they 're pretty happy with the lifestyle they have today , ' he said			0
they plan to put most of the coins up for sale through @entity164 while holding onto a few keepsakes			0
they 'll use the money to pay off bills and quietly donate to local charities , @entity57 said			0
before they sell them , they are loaning some to the @entity173 for its @entity174 , which opens thursday in @entity175			0
this image shows one of the six decaying metal canisters filled with 1800s - era @entity40 gold coins unearthed under the shade of a tree lucky find : a can containing 19th century gold coins is shown in the ground @entity36 1848 - 1864 @entity123 in @entity185 , @entity186 of the find that started the @entity36 while the lucky @entity1 couple who discovered the $ 10million in gold coins wo n't reveal themselves , the shocking find illustrates the vivid , gold - lined history of the region			1
the region where the ranch is located is known as @entity5			0
it was in the region in 1848 that the california gold rush began when the precious metal was discovered at @entity123 in @entity185 near @entity128			1
though it was just a few tiny nuggets , the find kicked off one of human history 's largest migrations as gold hungry prospectors descended on the area from around the world			2
fast forward to today and the region 's once booming population has shrunk considerably along with the ebb of the @entity36			0
the @entity45 thought the @entity36 ended some 150 years ago , the @entity1 couple stumbled upon a rich hoard			1
the coins date from 1847 to 1894			1
those dates are one of the things that makes the coins so rare			0
because paper money was illegal in @entity1 until the 1870s , most coins minted before then are extremely worn			0
however , coins in the @entity45 -- so named because that 's what the couple named the area of their ranch where the treasure was found -- are mostly in uncirculated mint condition			1
what makes their find particularly valuable , @entity150 said , is that almost all of the coins are in near - perfect condition			1
that means that whoever put them into the ground likely socked them away as soon as they were put into circulation			0
because paper money was illegal in @entity1 until the 1870s , he added , it 's extremely rare to find any coins from before that of such high quality			2
' it was n't really until the 1880s that you start seeing coins struck in @entity1 that were kept in real high grades of preservation , ' he said			0
the coins , in $ 5 , $ 10 and $ 20 denominations , were stored more or less in chronological order , @entity150 said , with the 1840s and 1850s pieces going into one canister until it was filed , then new coins going into the next one and the next one after that			0
the dates and the method indicated that whoever put them there was using the ground as their personal bank and that they were n't swooped up all at once in a robbery			0
although most of the coins were minted in @entity118 , one $ 5 gold piece came from as far away as @entity120			2
the coins were store chronologically , with the 1840s and 1850s pieces going into one canister until it was filed , then new coins going into the next one and the next one after that			0
the dates and the method indicated that whoever put them there was using the ground as their personal bank experts are lauding the @entity5 find as one of the most spectacular ever found in @entity288 and put its value at $ 10million or more			1
some of the rarer coins could fetch $ 1million a piece			0
here are some of the other frontrunners for greatest @entity40 treasures : @entity296 construction workers unearthed $ 1million in gold coins in 1985			1
400,000 silver coins were found in a dead @entity301 , @entity130 man 's home in 1974 and fetched $ 7.3million			2
coins and ingots worth $ 130million were found in the 1980s in a ship that sunk off @entity305 , but that hefty hoard was n't truly discovered ... historians knew all along it was out there @entity57 and @entity150 would say little about the couple 's property or its ownership history , other than it 's in a sprawling hilly area of @entity5 and the coins were found along a path the couple had walked for years			1
on the day they found them last spring , the woman had bent over to examine an old rusty can that erosion had caused to pop slightly out of the ground			2
they found eight cans in total			2
' do n't be above bending over to check on a rusty can , ' he said she told him			0
they are located on a section of the property the couple nicknamed @entity45 , and @entity57 is calling the find the @entity45			1
he believes it could be the largest such discovery in @entity40 history			2
one of the largest previous finds of gold coins was $ 1million worth uncovered by construction workers in @entity338 , @entity296 , in 1985			1
more than 400,000 silver dollars were found in the home of a @entity301 , @entity130 , man who died in 1974 and were later sold intact for $ 7.3million			0
gold coins and ingots said to be worth as much as $ 130million were recovered in the 1980s from the wreck of the @entity288			1
but historians knew roughly where that gold was because the ship went down off the coast of @entity305 during a hurricane in 1857 .			0

the lucky *unnamed* couple in their 40s stumbled on the historic find on their property last spring
the gold coins dating from 1847 to 1894 were stashed in eight cans along a trail the couple had walked for years
the once in a lifetime hoard is likely the most valuable ever found in the @entity40
it is thought that the previous owner socked the coins away as a gold rush - era bank
