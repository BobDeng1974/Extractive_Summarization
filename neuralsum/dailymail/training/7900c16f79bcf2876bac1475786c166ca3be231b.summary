by @entity0 the new lord chief justice , lord @entity1 , said criminal defendants could be allowed to take part in court hearings from home using @entity6 and @entity7 internet video calling software such as @entity6 and @entity7 could allow criminal defendants to appear in court from home , the country ’s most senior judge has said			1
lord chief justice lord @entity1 said the use of video links in hearings held before @entity20 trials would slash the cost of bringing to court prisoners , defendants on bail and their lawyers			1
but critics said criminals should not be allowed to appear ‘ from the comfort of their living room ’ , while others said video links would demean the ‘ dignity ’ of the court			2
lord @entity1 , who took over as head of the judiciary in @entity37 and @entity38 last month , said internet video calls would be cheaper than the dedicated closed circuit tv systems which are often installed in court buildings because they are supposed to protect security			1
‘ there are innovative ways of providing open justice bearing in mind things such as @entity6 and @entity7 , ’ said lord @entity1 in his first annual press conference since taking up his post			1
‘ we need to loosen up our use of @entity6 and @entity7 , which current it systems do n’t really allow			0
' i am very keen that we should because with most of what happens in court you do n’t have problems with security , and we can be much more open to use of @entity6 and @entity7 than we traditionally have been			2
’ lord @entity1 suggested lawyers , prisoners and defendants released on bail could all communicate with the court using the technology he said he had singled out @entity6 and @entity66 ’s @entity7 on the basis of cost and said internet video programs could not be used during full - scale criminal trials but at the pre-trial hearings at which judges and lawyers prepare the ground for the trial			1
‘ a lot of the difficulties we have are that to make a court case work well you need a pre-trial hearing , ’ he said			2
‘ but it is often very expensive to get a prisoner or a person who is out on bail to come to court , to get the lawyers to come to court and i think a lot of this can be solved by the use of technology			1
’ however , @entity94 mp , @entity96 ’s shadow justice secretary , said : ‘ i am shocked by this suggestion			2
' defendants appearing via @entity6 from the comfort of their own living room for their trial is taking justice on the cheap to a new low			2
lord @entity1 also revealed guidelines on dealing with face - veils in courtrooms would go out to public consultation			1
prime minister @entity108 ( left ) and minister @entity109 ( right ) have both spoken out against women being allowed to wear veils while giving evidence in court ‘ it ’s ridiculous that defendants should be given the option of avoiding their day in the dock while witnesses , including the victim , have made the effort to go to court			1
‘ being charged with a criminal offence is a serious matter and should be treated as such by the defendant			0
’ @entity125 , the @entity126 mp for @entity127 and @entity128 , said : ‘ this is lazy justice			0
it saves on time , trouble and money			0
' there are innovative ways of actually providing open justice bearing in mind things such as @entity6 and @entity7			0
we need to loosen up our use of @entity6 and @entity7 , which current it systems do n’t really allow ' ' but it diminishes the dignity of the legal system and i am worried about it			0
’ but @entity147 , a barrister and the @entity126 mp for @entity149 , said : ‘ pre-trial hearings are often a formality			0
' they are held to work out how long the trial will last and who is required as a witness			0
it seems to me a sensible area to look for ways to save money			0
’ criminologist dr @entity161 , of the @entity162 think tank , said : ‘ at the moment , the process is expensive and consumes a lot of time before the trial gets going			0
it is possible there could be savings without any danger to justice			0
‘ it may be that @entity6 may lead to a better use of the time of judges and lawyers , and less risk of prisoners escaping when they are moved about to go to court			1
’ lord @entity1 also revealed that a decision over guidance to be given to judges on whether women should be allowed to wear the veil in court would shortly be made the subject of a public consultation .			1
