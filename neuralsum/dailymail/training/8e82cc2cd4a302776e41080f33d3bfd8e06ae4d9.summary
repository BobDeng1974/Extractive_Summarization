by @entity0 and @entity1 the blood which stained his white cotton shirt may have faded from vibrant red to black , but dr @entity7 ’s memories of the day president @entity8 was shot remain indelible – especially the heartbreaking sight of the @entity10 saying her final goodbyes to her husband			1
dr @entity7 is one of only two doctors still alive who battled to save the president after he suffered terrible gunshot injuries in @entity17 on november 22 , 1963			1
‘ it was horrifying to see president @entity8 lying on his back on the stretcher with the operating room light shining down on his bloody head , ’ recalls dr @entity7 , now 84			1
fateful day : president @entity8 and first lady @entity24 ride in the president 's motorcade through @entity17 on november 22 , 1963 ‘ i can still see that in my mind ’s eye as if it happened today			1
his face was greyish , his eyes were open and his head was covered in blood			0
i did n’t have time to put on gloves or scrubs			0
i operated with my bare hands			0
’ dr @entity7 had raced to @entity38 at the @entity39 in @entity17 after hearing the terrible news that the president ’s motorcade had been attacked			1
he recalls how , as he pushed through the crowds of police officers , @entity43 agents and hospital staff , he saw the president ’s wife @entity47 sitting on a chair outside the operating theatre , her pink @entity52 wool suit covered in blood			1
once inside the theatre , dr @entity7 was joined by dr @entity54 , then a junior surgeon			1
dr @entity54 went on to be one of the world ’s leading craniofacial specialists			1
in his newly released autobiography , @entity60 , dr @entity54 says the priority was to get the president breathing by inserting a tube down his throat and into his lungs			1
‘ the whole right - hand side of president @entity8 ’s cranium had been blown away , ’ he remembers			1
fatal journey : president @entity8 , and @entity47 pictured with @entity71 , governor of @entity73 , and his wife @entity74 , the day before the assassination taking over : @entity76 is sworn in as @entity77 in the cabin of the presidential plane as @entity24 stands at his side just hours after the assassination ‘ much of the right side of his brain had been destroyed as well , and the remainder was exposed by a gaping hole in his skull			1
‘ the team was n’t having any success at getting a tube down through the president ’s nose , so we focused instead on a small bullet wound in the president ’s neck , through which he was sucking air			2
‘ by enlarging the size of the wound , we ultimately were able to insert a breathing tube into the president ’s lung			2
although none of us spoke about it , it was already certain to each of us that anything more we might do to assist the president would be in vain			2
‘ the injury was absolutely a fatal one , yet although his brain had been devastated , his heart was still beating , and his body continued to reflexively gasp for breath			0
‘ our patient was fatally wounded , but he was also the @entity77 , and we were obligated to try every heroic procedure imaginable to save him			2
’ it was , adds dr @entity54 , a disastrous irony that the president ’s bravery as a pilot during the @entity123 , and the wounds he suffered then , had quite possibly sealed his fate			1
‘ we began to cut away the president ’s clothes , and i remember my surprise at the size and thickness of the massive brace he wore around his chest and abdomen			2
‘ i knew the president had suffered a back injury during his service in the @entity123 , but the brace was far more restrictive than anything i could have envisioned			2
‘ as i cut away the brace , which was tightly laced like a corset , with heavy shears , it was hard to imagine he could move while wearing it , and it seemed certain that the war injury was far more serious – and painful – than the public knew			0
‘ the brace had kept his body upright and out in the open which meant he was a target for subsequent shots			0
had he not been wearing it he might have survived			0
’ in contrast , @entity73 governor @entity71 , who was seated in the same limousine as the president that day in november 1963 , slumped to the floor after a bullet hit him and survived			2
the medical team put an intravenous line into the president ’s right arm , gave him ‘ massive amounts of blood ’ , massaged his heart , injected him with steroids ( he suffered from @entity168 ’s disease , a rare disorder of the adrenal glands ) and inserted chest tubes , but nothing improved his condition			2
‘ we worked intensely , suggesting to one another anything we might still try , but each of us knew that all hope was lost , ’ says dr @entity54			2
doctors worked on the president for 12 minutes but the signal on his heart monitor remained flat			1
during that time mrs @entity24 wandered in and out of the room			0
‘ she continued to stand erect and without assistance , her face expressing both her shock and her profound sorrow , ’ says dr @entity54			0
at 1pm , after every monitor attached to the president ’s body had flatlined , dr @entity187 , the hospital ’s chief of neurosurgery , announced in a ‘ calm yet shaken voice ’ : ‘ gentlemen , president @entity8 has died			1
’ the room emptied , but dr @entity54 remained at the head of the operating table as both the @entity10 and a priest approached the body			0
‘ as i stood at the table , mrs @entity24 approached it , and i remember her looking at me as if [ to ask ] that was ok			0
i nodded and watched as she moved close to the president ’s body			0
‘ she leaned across him to reach for his left hand , removed his wedding ring and placed it on one of her fingers , and then she simply held her husband ’s hand in a final goodbye			1
‘ i was still standing beside the table , numb and disbelieving , when a few men entered the room with a wooden casket , placed the president ’s body inside it , then carried him away			0
’ dr @entity7 recalls that moment slightly differently , suggesting that as well as taking her husband ’s ring , @entity24 also placed her own ring on his hand			1
‘ she was very self - contained , not crying or hysterical or anything like that			0
‘ she stood there very dignified , very quiet , and walked slowly down to the end of the gurney where the president ’s bare right foot was protruding out from the sheet that he was covered with			0
‘ she stood there for a moment , leaned over and kissed his foot , then walked out of the room			0
that was the last we saw of her			0
’ dr @entity7 ’s suit , covered with the president ’s blood , was sent to a dry cleaner by his wife			1
but he kept the stained white shirt from that day as it was – ‘ to always remember ’			0
