by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson back in the 2007 - 08 season a teenage striker by the name of @entity3 was breaking into the @entity5 first team allowing nothing and nobody – not even @entity8 and @entity9 – could stand in his way			1
on the club ’s pre-season tour of @entity13 , with @entity8 the expensive new signing from @entity15 , @entity3 was the star impressing so much that @entity5 had to turn down offers from @entity17 to take him on loan			1
he stayed to fight for a place in the first team and became @entity5 ’s youngest - ever goalscorer when he netted against @entity23 that october aged 17 years and 54 days and he was called up to the @entity25 squad , only to pull out because of sickness			1
in the april after @entity3 became @entity5 's youngest - ever scorer , the @entity39 giants drew @entity76 in the @entity45 semi-final			1
then - manager @entity78 was under pressure to pick the youngster instead of @entity8 - after all , the kid from the youth team had eight league goals to his name , one more than the @entity85 , having played fewer minutes			2
his strike against @entity87 in the quarter - finals had opened the scoring in the first - leg and @entity8 himself admitted : ' you can understand it			2
he is having a fantastic season			0
he is a @entity94 kid and the supporters love nothing more than to have a local hero			0
' things got even better for the local hero in the following seasons			0
@entity101 was promoted from the b - team to first - team coach and although at first that stunted @entity3 ’s development because the two had not always seen eye to eye the season before , eventually @entity101 was won over			1
when the 2009 - 10 season started @entity5 began the campaign with @entity9 , @entity42 and @entity8 in attack but it was @entity3 who finished up as first choice with the disgruntled @entity9 left out of key end of season matches			1
the competition to stay in the team continued relentless however , and when @entity9 left the following summer @entity117 turned up			0
with @entity118 , @entity42 and the emerging @entity119 , @entity101 found the front three that was to destroy @entity76 in the @entity122 final at @entity123			0
you 're the man : @entity8 ( right ) points at @entity3 after the youngster scored in the @entity45 quarter - final no way through : @entity9 was kept on the sidelines by an in - form @entity3 in the 2009 - 2010 season @entity3 the boy wonder had become the forgotten man			1
and like so many schooled by @entity5 who then have to make their way beyond the confines of the @entity134 , he found it tough			0
he had been at @entity5 since signing as an eight - year - old			1
his @entity138 - born father , then a @entity5 scout , had played for @entity139 before moving to @entity140 where he met @entity3 ’s mother			2
his dad was the driving force in his son ’s career as he scored more than 900 goals in various levels of the club ’s youth system before becoming the third youngest first - team player in the club ’s history in september 2007			2
it had been too much too young , perhaps			0
even the @entity25 call - up had been brought forward because his dual - nationality made him eligible for @entity138			0
he had won the player of the tournament award two years running in the @entity158 @entity68 , made his debut for the under 21 side aged just 16 , and became the second youngest player ever to represent his country when he finally made his debut in 2008 but the international career never got going and he faded from view at @entity5			2
loan spell : @entity3 joined @entity17 on loan for the year in 2013 and had been at @entity5 since signing as an eight - year - old @entity3 's move to @entity32 will see him team up with former @entity5 defender @entity33 , who signed at the start of july			1
@entity33 , who had been at the @entity134 since starting his youth career in 2002 - three years after @entity3 , was unable to tie down a regular place at @entity5			1
2009 - 2013 : @entity54 ( 79 apps , 4 gls ) 2009 - 2013 : @entity5 ( 2 , 0 ) 2013 - now : @entity32 ( 0 , 0 ) there was a lack of versatility in his game			2
as a youngster he had shone as a scampering centre - forward , always appearing at the right time with the perfect finish			0
but when @entity42 moved to a central position under @entity101 , @entity3 would have to readjust to the demands of playing as a wide forward in @entity5 ’s 4 - 3 - 3 and he never managed it			1
now , after unsuccessful spells under current @entity5 manager @entity188 at @entity56 , and under another former @entity5 player @entity189 at @entity17 , he finds himself under yet another one - time @entity5 player in @entity31			0
the @entity37 will be tough			0
he ’s only 23 but this shot at the most competitive league in the world feels like a last chance to fulfil all that early promise			0
former coach @entity78 once said of him : ‘ he is a special player who always makes the right decision on the pitch			0
’ he has taken a big decision off it this summer			0
those at @entity5 who remember how he once upstaged one of the @entity37 ’s greatest ever performers , @entity8 , will hope it turns out well for him			1
is he up to it ? the @entity37 will be tough on @entity3 but he 's got his chance to show what he 's worth team : @entity33 ( right ) will soon be reunited with former @entity5 team - mate @entity3 at the @entity207 familiar : @entity33 ( right ) tackles @entity209 striker @entity208 and joined the @entity5 youth system in 2002			1

@entity32 make @entity3 fifth signing of the season on four - year deal , leaving @entity5 after joining @entity39 giants as an eight - year - old
forward became @entity5 's youngest - ever goalscorer aged 17 years and 54 days with strike against @entity23
@entity3 became first choice ahead of @entity9 and @entity8 , who said : ' you can understand it . he is having a fantastic season '
the 23 - year - old was forgotten at @entity5 soon after but can get first - team chances in @entity37 with @entity32
will @entity3 be the closest we find out to whether @entity42 could hack a cold , wet tuesday night at the @entity207 ?
