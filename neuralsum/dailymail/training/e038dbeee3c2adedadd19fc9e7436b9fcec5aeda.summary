@entity0 is determined to establish himself at the heart of @entity3 ’s @entity2 despite being marginalised under the new manager			1
@entity0 emerged as a shining light amid the gloom of @entity7 ’ time in charge and was rewarded with a five - year contract worth £ 50,000 - a - week exactly a year ago			1
but the 19 - year - old @entity11 forward has yet to start a game under @entity13 , making all six of his first - team appearances this season off the bench while playing for the club ’s under 21 team			1
