but according to the latest study , many couples have rather specific playlists - namely baby - making playlists with a variety of inspiring songs to ' get them in the mood '			2
the study , which asked parents to share the music they choose to accompany their more intimate moments , found that over half of broody couples listen to music whilst trying to conceive			1
let 's get it on : a study has found that over half of broody couples listen to music whilst trying to conceive of these , three quarters admitted that they did so in order to help them ‘ get in the mood ’			1
and it was @entity32 's awarding - winning track @entity30 that was the number one preference for broody couples			1
in second place was @entity37 's rock track @entity35 , followed by the slightly cliche @entity39 single			1
unsurprisingly , @entity41 's @entity40 made the top five and his sexual healing single was voted in eighth place			2
@entity45 , founder of @entity46 , who carried out the study and put together the ultimate baby making playlist , said : ' music plays a huge part in every aspect of life , and it ’s no surprise to see that @entity55 make full use of it in the bedroom department			0
what gets them in the mood : @entity32 's ballad @entity30 and @entity37 's @entity65 are among the top three tracks that couple 's conceiving babies like to listen to ' we wanted to find out more about which songs get brits in the mood the most , specifically when it comes to baby making , which can be a stressful time in the bedroom department for many			1
' based on the results , we ’ve been able to put together what we see as the " ultimate baby making playlist " to help broody couples around the country			1
' the songs are tried and tested by parents , so whilst we ca n’t guarantee the success they ’ll encourage , we can guarantee that they ’ll help get you in the mood ! ' 1			0
