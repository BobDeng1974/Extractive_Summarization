wonder is written on their faces as they peer over the edge of the barrows to see what might be around the next corner			2
one particularly curious passenger seems in danger of falling out as he leans precariously over the front wheel			2
baby orangutans are moved into the new @entity27 centre at @entity28 in @entity29 the adorable baby apes are on their way to their own private patch of rainforest - all thanks to the generosity of @entity13 readers when they reach their destination , in the middle of @entity29 ’s lush jungle , sheer excitement gets the better of them			1
they spill out , tumbling over each other in a tangle of skinny , red limbs , eager to explore			2
it ’s mayhem , until their keepers — wearing facemasks to avoid passing on human germs — are able to round them up , and lead them by the hands to the trees where they can swing from branches , forage for food and learn to live as wild orangutans			2
life could have been very different for these affectionate and trusting babies , who hand - in - hand with their human guardians , look uncannily like a group of nursery school children on a day out			2
it seems impossible to believe that , without the support provided by your donations , they would have been doomed to a wretched existence in captivity , half - starved , beaten and living in chains as illegal trophy pets			2
all these young orangutans , one of the world ’s most endangered species , are orphans			0

life in captivity is harsh			0
chained up , underfed , mistreated and beaten by their owners — and sometimes tormented by local children — pet orangutans in @entity29 rarely live to be fully grown			1
females mature sometime between the ages of six and 11 but males are not fully adult until they are 15			0
since the appeal was published in the @entity13 two years ago , £ 500,000 has been raised to enable the @entity27 charity ( @entity27 ) to build an orangutan sanctuary on 64 acres in @entity109 , @entity110 @entity29			1
the red - haired babies sleep in a safe compound each night , and go out to play and rediscover their freedom in the forest enclosure every day			0
their feet are really a second pair of hands , made for holding and grasping branches rather than taking a stroll			0
so local volunteers load their charges into wheelbarrows and trundle them to the trees but this is much more than primate playtime — it ’s essential for their health because orangutans are n’t built for walking			0
they are tree - dwelling animals , uncomfortable on the ground , and their legs are not designed to take their weight for any distance , especially when they are young and still developing			0

@entity146 , the chief executive of @entity27 , says : ‘ for every baby orangutan at the centre , a mother orangutan has died , not to mention all the males that must also have been killed			1
’ without urgent action , orangutans could soon be extinct in the wild two years ago , the @entity13 highlighted the plight of a female orangutan called @entity157			1
she had been captured 15 years earlier and kept as a pet by a fisherman who had shot her mother			1
chained up on the verandah of a hut , @entity157 survived on the scraps thrown to her by tourists			0
help poured in from @entity13 readers and @entity27 was able to save @entity157 and dozens of others			1
but there ’s more still to do			0
in the wild , these creatures can travel up to 3.5km a day through the tree canopy , so the charity ’s ambitious plan is to buy land off the coast of @entity29 and create entire island sanctuaries , where @entity157 and others can be gradually reintroduced to the wild			1

help poured in from @entity13 readers and @entity27 was able to save @entity157 and dozens of others land in @entity188 is cheap , by @entity190 standards			1
one island for six orangutans would cost about £ 12,000 — but running costs are much higher , an estimated £ 50,000 a year			1
thanks to the destruction of their rainforest habitat by timber companies and palm oil growers , as well as the cruel pet trade , orangutan numbers have plummeted from 315,000 in 1990 to fewer than 50,000 today			2
without urgent action , orangutans could soon be extinct in the wild			0
and joyous scenes like this will be nothing but painful reminders that with a little determination we could have done much more to save them			0
