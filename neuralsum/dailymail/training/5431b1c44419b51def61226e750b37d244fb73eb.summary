her doctor had also warned that her body mass index ( @entity22 ) was ' off the chart '			1
@entity4 , 32 , has gone down from a size 22 ( left ) to a slim size 8 ( right ) after realising she was so obese she was breathless tying her own shoelaces ms @entity4 said before losing the weight ( left ) she loved toast , frozen ready meals , roast dinners and desserts , whereas now ( right ) she eats porridge , soup and fresh fish with vegetables ms @entity4 was always overweight as a teenager , but after putting on three stone after the birth of her son , now two , her weight spiralled out of control			1
she became so obese a doctor said her @entity22 was ' off the scale ' a doctor told her she was so obese that her @entity22 , previously 43 before her pregnancy , was now off the scale , and this spurred her to lose weight through the @entity48 diet plan and taking more exercise			1
@entity48 is a diet plan in which food is replaced with ready - mixed packs or shakes which contain all the nutrients a person 's body would need in a day , but totalling only 600 calories			1

since shedding the weight 11 months ago ms @entity4 says she is able to race around with her son and now has achieved her goal of looking elegant while driving a carriage			1
mrs @entity4 said : ' i realised i was holding my breath to do up my shoes and the shock of this was my lowest point			1
‘ i had the big tire around my middle			0
it was pressing on my chest so i could n’t breathe			0
‘ then i thought “ i wonder how heavy i am ”			0
' i was n't paying attention because i was running around after my son			2
i was looking after him but not after myself			0

she said : ‘ i ’ve always been bigger			0
i remember being 13 in secondary school and having meetings with the school dietitian because i was bigger than i was supposed to be			0
ms @entity4 decided to join @entity48 's weight loss programme and through changing her diet and carrying out exercise , she managed to lose nearly 10 stone in under a year a doctor said ms @entity4 's @entity22 , which was over 43 , was so high it was ' off the scale '			1

@entity178 as a dessert ‘ i was always conscious that i was bigger than my friends			0
’ at age 22 , she decided to lose weight and went to the gym , even running a 5km @entity186			1
but after the birth of her son she could no longer maintain such an exercise regime			1
she said her pregnancy weight , combined with a lack of exercise and a near - addiction to unhealthy food , meant her weight began to soar			1
she said : ‘ i love food , i love @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199			2
‘ i always ate dessert , that was the pleasing part of the meal			2
‘ my intake was high but my exercise was low			0
‘ then i got pregnant and put on an extra three stone			2
the amount of food that went into my body was just incredible			2
' she added she did n’t realise her weight was so high : ‘ when you put on a couple of pounds a month , you do n’t notice			2
' if your jeans get a bit tight you do n’t really notice , you just wear something else in your wardrobe			0
’ the moment she realised she was breathless bending down to tie her laces was the ‘ trigger ’ moment			1
after this she went to her gp , who confirmed that her @entity22 , which was 43 before she became pregnant , was now so high it was ‘ off the scale ’			1
ms @entity4 was officially classed as ' morbidly obese ' at over 43 , well outside the healthy range of 18.5 to 25			1
she looked around for a weight loss programme ‘ i was conscious of @entity227 ’s story			2
that ’s when i found @entity48			1
' i went for a consultation and i liked the weekly group sessions			0
after i ’d done a couple of weeks i did n’t worry about not being with my family			0
i enjoyed it , it was time for me			0
' we did n’t talk about dieting and calories and food			2
it was like life lessons			0
it was about identifying the eating triggers			0
we did things like worry trees			0
' so we resolved our life issues so we did n’t need food to solve it			2
' @entity247 was a big factor for me			0
i had a time between 7 and 8 , after dinner , child in bed , and that time was snack time			2
' i would pick up something that i would n’t need for nutrition			2
' sticking to the diet , she managed to lose between two and six pounds a week , eventually shedding almost 10 stone			1
ms @entity4 ’s hobby is horse carriage driving and so she decided to set herself a goal of losing weight so she could feel graceful at the reins			1
she said : ‘ i have been driving carriages for two and a half years			0
i show my mother ’s horse and drive around the country showing the horse			0
‘ when i was getting to the end of the season , i was going into a new class where i needed a sense of elegance			0
she has finally achieved her goal of looking elegant while carrying out her hobby of horse carriage driving			0
before her weight loss she says she felt ' cumbersome ' , ' like a workman ' and struggled getting on the horse before losing weight ms @entity4 said she would have struggled sitting down cross-legged for a picnic , but with her trim physique she is able to enjoy picnics with her son ‘ i felt very cumbersome			1
i felt like a workman like rather than elegant			0
i found it hard to get on and off the horse which is embarrassing			0
‘ so i aimed to start the year confident and elegant , with a lovely hat			2
to feel as if i belonged more			0
and now i do ! ’ one of the greatest joys of losing weight is that she is now able to play with her son , she said			1
‘ my son loves picnics but i would have struggled to sit cross legged before on the ground , and my knees would hurt getting up			2
now i can have a picnic without worrying			0
' she added : ‘ now i run around with my son , i race him while he ’s on the bike			0
he always says " chase me chase me ! " and i can now			0
