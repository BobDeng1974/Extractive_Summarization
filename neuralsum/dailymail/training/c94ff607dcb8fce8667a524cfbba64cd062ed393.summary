by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 14:29 est , 6 december 2012 some experts are predicting that @entity2 and @entity3 will end up with twins – and if they do , there could be more than just the usual parenting headaches ahead for the royal couple			1
no mother of a future monarch has given birth to twins in @entity12 since the 15th century – so nobody is quite sure what will happen if @entity2 makes history and produces a brace of infants next summer			1
but the debilitating symptoms currently suffered by @entity2 in the @entity41 in central @entity43 point to hyperemesis gravidarum , a condition experienced slightly more often by women expecting twins			1
if it did prove to be the case that @entity2 was carrying two children , and she gave birth to them naturally , the rule of primogeniture that has dictated the royal succession for centuries would mean that if the twins are boys , the first - born would ascend the throne			1
and until recently , if the twins were boy and girl , it would be the boy who got to wear the crown			1
but under new legislation , if @entity2 gives birth to a mixed pair , it will be the first - born who succeeds – no matter their gender			1
but if @entity2 were to require either an emergency or an elective caesarean , then things get very much more complicated			1
last year , crown princess mary of denmark – the wife of the country ’s next monarch – gave birth to twins			1
there was some anxiety beforehand that her babies might have to be delivered by caesarean section , leading to speculation that it would be the obstetrician who chose which child to deliver first and thus in which order they would be in line to the throne after their elder siblings			2
happily , she did n’t have to go through with a caesarean section birth , and gave birth to prince @entity29 25 minutes ahead of his sister , princess @entity26			2
were those circumstances to arise here and a caesarean be required , the task of picking who would be the future king or queen would fall , in theory , to @entity104 – the royal gynaecologist still better known as the former fiance of murdered @entity108 presenter @entity107			2
mr @entity104 , 47 , now a distinguished figure in the world of obstetrics , has held the royal post since 2008 , and experienced himself the joy of fatherhood for the first time early last year when his wife @entity116 , 33 , gave birth to a boy			2
but while he will be more than prepared for the challenges ahead , it ’s unlikely mr @entity104 would want to shoulder the responsibility of choosing whom he brought into the world first			0
which begs the question – who would ? would it be @entity3 , who ’s expected , like most modern fathers , to be present at the birth ? would the royal family have to revert to the odd practices of yesteryear , where a government minister had to be present at the accouchement to act as an observer and ensure everything was above board ? last time that happened to a future monarch was in 1926 , when the present @entity140 was born and home secretary sir @entity141 was required to be present , albeit in an adjoining room			0
should that be the case again next year the job will fall to @entity145 , the present home secretary			0
concerned : @entity3 , left , visits his pregnant wife , right , at @entity41 in @entity43 twins : a mother cradles her 2 week old twin girls ( file photo ) if @entity2 and @entity3 really are set for double joy , there are various unusual factors to expect			1
around 12,000 twin births occur each year , with around 200 triplet births and a handful of higher order births			0
these numbers have been on the increase since 1980 , thanks to factors including the use of fertility drugs , assisted conception techniques and even maternal age ( older mothers are more likely to conceive multiples )			1
non-identical twins are created when a woman produces two eggs at the same time and both are fertilised , each by a different sperm			2
the fertilised egg is called a zygote , and these non-identical twins are known as dizygotic or fraternal twins			2
the babies are no more alike than any other brothers or sisters			0
identical twins occur in about a third of multiple pregnancies			2
known as monozygotic twins , a single egg is fertilised splits into two ( or , very rarely , three or more ) creating identical babies with the same genes , features and sex			2
they may or may not share a placenta			0
characteristics such as size and personality depend on non-genetic factors , so may differ			0
triplets and higher order multiples are formed this way too , but you may have a set of triplets where two are identical and one is not			0
faced with the prospect of choosing which twin became the heir , the @entity206 would be able to consider various precedents set when similar situations have arisen			0
their friend the @entity213 faced such a situation three years ago when his twin sons were born by caesarean			0
in the end , his ancient title went to his first - born , @entity219 , who now bears his father ’s courtesy title @entity213 ; his twin is more simply known as lord @entity223			0
what @entity224 ca n’t do is draw on any recent experience in either family tree , for there ’s almost no history of twins in @entity3 ’s extended family , and a trawl back through @entity2 ’s rich and varied ancestry comes up with very few examples – and none in recent times			1
should @entity2 actually prove to be carrying twins , though , she will hope they find better fortune than the last pair of royal infants			1
in 1430 , @entity243 of @entity244 ’s wife @entity140 @entity242 gave birth to two boys			0
the first , @entity219 , was named as the heir to the throne and given the title @entity250 – a title still carried today by @entity3 ’s father as @entity252			0
the second twin , @entity253 , would have expected an easy life – except that within a year his elder brother had died and he assumed the @entity250 title			0
by the time he was six , his father had been assassinated and he rose unsteadily to the @entity244 throne as @entity253 of @entity244			0
we no longer live in such unsettled times , but for @entity3 and @entity2 , there will still be an element of uncertainty – until they know for certain whether they have twins on the way or not			1
watch the interview here video : double your money ? the latest odds on @entity2 having twins ...			1

@entity2 more likely to be having twins because of her age and her acute *morning* *sickness*
*bookies* have *slashed* the odds on twins from 50/1 to *8/1*
just seconds could be the difference between one ruler and another
*duchess* of @entity287 was taken to *hospital* yesterday and forced to *announce* her pregnancy before 12 weeks
