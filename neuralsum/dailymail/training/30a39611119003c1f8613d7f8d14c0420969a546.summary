@entity0 has reported its first - ever @entity2 profit , putting an end to years of losses that saw it avoid paying taxes in @entity2			1
the coffee chain was branded ‘ immoral ’ by mps for using a host of schemes that effectively funnelled money out of the @entity2 and overseas			1
the practice allowed it to notch up losses , avoiding the need to pay corporation tax , despite reporting years of bumper sales			1
profit : @entity0 made its first - ever @entity2 profit of £ 1.1m after sales for the previous year were more than £ 300m but the @entity20 giant yesterday reported a modest pre-tax profit of £ 1.1million in its @entity2 operations – a paltry amount given that sales for the previous year were in excess of £ 300million			1
the firm refused to issue details of its revenues in a highly unusual move			0
the small profit resulted in a meagre tax payment of just £ 232,363 , a sum that is likely to be dwarfed by its multi-million pound revenues when it issues full accounts later this week			1
it paid an additional £ 11.2million in corporation tax , which it said was the final instalment of the £ 20million it offered to pay three years ago when faced with a consumer backlash			1
@entity0 faced protests and boycotts following revelations that it had scrimped on tax payments in the @entity2 for years			1
it emerged the group had paid just £ 8.6million in corporation tax since coming to @entity2 in 1998 , despite racking up combined sales of more than £ 3billion			1
@entity2 boss , @entity49 , said company 's performance is a result of ' engaging with its employees , giving customers more and growing the business ' the firm claimed this was due to high costs of renting its stores but an investigation uncovered payments made to the @entity64 and @entity65 for purchasing its coffee			2
the latest profit figures also are in stark contrast to comments made last year by @entity2 boss @entity49 , who said that the company needed to ‘ get its mojo back ’ before it returned to the black			2
yesterday he said : ‘ @entity0 @entity2 is now showing a profit before tax , representing an important milestone for the @entity2 business			2
‘ the company ’s strong performance is the result of a turnaround strategy that has focused on engaging with our employees , giving customers more , growing the business and improving our model by rebalancing the store portfolio and carefully managing costs			0
’ the @entity89 - based chain , which first opened in @entity2 on @entity91 ’s @entity90 , said that over the past three years it had closed 67 unprofitable cafes			2
but it has opened more @entity0 franchises that have cheaper running costs			0
mr @entity49 said @entity2 is the firm ’s largest market across @entity97			0
tax accountant @entity98 said choosing not to reveal its sales figure was ‘ rather odd ’			0
he said : ‘ we have consistently said that the way to avoid criticism is to give us all of the information , and be transparent			0
@entity0 have n’t given us the information			0
’ the @entity106 has been investigating links between the @entity64 and companies that base themselves in the country for tax purposes			0
@entity0 moved its @entity97 headquarters to the @entity2 from the @entity64 last year , just as the @entity113 began investigating its tax affairs			2
but it still brews all of its @entity97 coffee in the country before selling it on to its businesses in other parts of the world , including the @entity2 .			0
