@entity0 admits he has fallen short of match - winning efforts too often as an @entity4 opener , but is ready to put that behind him after a record knock of 187			1
@entity0 hit 20 fours and three sixes in a 145 - ball knock against an @entity11 prime minister 's @entity9 , and in the process registered @entity4 's best score in one - day cricket			1
it was enough to settle a high - scoring contest in the tourists ' favour , by a margin of 60 runs , and ranks as a sizeable achievement for a player who was sweating for his place in the side a matter of weeks ago			2
@entity0 acknowledges the crowd after being caught out on 187 in @entity4 's exhibition game @entity0 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) touch gloves during their knock against a @entity11 prime minister 's @entity9 @entity0 pictured in action during his tremendous knock for @entity4 as @entity35 preparations continue @entity0 was not required for @entity4 last five matches in @entity37 before @entity38 but earned a recall in the aftermath of @entity42 's departure as captain			1
@entity0 knows a record of three centuries in 150 one - day internationals is not enough for a player of his calibre and intends on changing that for the better in the forthcoming tri-series and @entity35			1
' one thing i 've probably been guilty of in the time i 've been opening is getting to 60 , 70 , 80 but never really gone on and enjoyed myself the way i did today , ' he said			0
' i 've been guilty in one - day cricket of getting a lot of 50s and not converting enough , but this is what i can do if i bat 45.5 overs or whatever it was			1
' i 've spoken to ( coach ) @entity61 about that and i believe i can play at the top of the order for @entity4			2
the thing is converting starts into match - winning scores			2
' today was pretty much perfect template-wise and that 's how i 'd like to play in one - day cricket			1
' if i can do that a couple of times this winter , that 's great for the team			0
' @entity0 was honest enough to accept he was not a certain pick in the first xi , with the @entity78 opener @entity79 having his supporters and @entity81 also involved in the 15 - man squad			1
@entity0 was unsure if he would make the team following the departure of @entity42 as captain but @entity42 's replacement , @entity87 , assured @entity0 he would have an opportunity to earn a starting place but he has benefited from a vote of confidence from @entity42 's replacement as skipper , @entity87			1
' coming out here i did n't know where i was going to bat or if i would start , so it was nice to have a good chat with @entity97 and for him to say i would get first crack at opening , ' said @entity0			2
' that filled me with a lot of confidence			0
' i 've done a lot of netting in the last month or so but not a lot of game time			0
it was nice to get a really big score in a competitive match			0
' you want it to be competitive , people playing for places			0
' that 's a good thing but it 's nice to get on the tour and start well			0
' @entity117 paceman @entity116 played against @entity0 and joked he has got his runs out of the way on the tour opposition paceman @entity116 , who will be part of the @entity117 squad in the tri-series and the @entity35 opener against @entity4 on february 14 , praised @entity0 but made a cheeky prediction for the coming weeks			1
' the innings he played was pretty faultless , ' said the seamer , whose six overs cost 52			0
' he hit the balls along the ground , picked the gaps and was very impressive			0
' but i think he 's got his runs out of the way for the tour now , so i 'm pleased he 's back in the shed ! '			0
