by @entity0 @entity1 is determined to avoid another black friday after setting @entity2 alight with a wonderful , pace - setting 66 before a bumper crowd at @entity4			1
the gifted @entity5 has thrilled the golfing world this season with a number of brilliant opening rounds , only to undo all the good work the following day			1
clearing the way : @entity1 leads after the first day at the @entity2 kicking up dust : @entity1 plays out of a bunker on the 18th hole on day one at @entity15 video @entity2 : first @entity17 highlights ‘ hopefully i ’m able to turn that round , ’ said the 25 - year - old			1
‘ it started with a bad friday afternoon at the masters and the next two events as well			2
i just have to take one hole at a time			0
' any time you shoot 66 at the @entity2 , you 're going to be pleased : it 's another great start and i 'm looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow			1
whenever i go out and play on thursdays there 's not really many expectations			0
' you 're going out there and you 're trying to find a rhythm and you 're just trying to play your way into the round			0
' when you go back out on friday after a good score you know what you can do , so you 're going out with some expectations compared to thursday			0
' i just have to take it one hole at a time , one shot at a time - i know everyone says it and you 've heard it a million times , but it 's true			2
' top man : @entity1 topped the leaderboard after the first day at sun - drenched royal @entity4 centre of attention : a camera follows @entity1 along the 14th fairway in control : @entity1 will hope to continue his form into friday where conditions are expected to worsen video @entity1 press conference @entity1 is an aggregate 57 under for first rounds this year nine over for second rounds			1
the one downside was the number of times the leading players had to back off shots because spectators were taking photographs on their phones — forcing the @entity70 to appeal to the public last night not to take photos			2
inevitably , @entity73 was the one who suffered most			2
‘ people were taking pictures all day and we were backing off shots all the time , ’ he said			1
