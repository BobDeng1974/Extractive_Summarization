@entity0 could barely grasp what he had just heard when @entity3 team - mate @entity2 offered him £ 10,000 one day in 2008 to get out for fewer than 10 in a @entity5 game the following afternoon against @entity6			1
a chat with his mum that night helped crystallise his reasons for saying no. ' i said : " @entity11 , i do n't think i 'd even do it for 100 , 200 , 300 grand " , ' @entity0 told @entity13			1
' ultimately , it 's about looking your parents in the eye			1
they 'd given all their time for me to play sport as a kid			2
that was the thing - not the money			2
' next day , a few hours before the start of the match , @entity0 was warming up in the nets when @entity2 upped the offer			1
' he said : " look , the money 's double - £ 20,000			1
" i just gave him a definite no. i said : " @entity29 , i do n't want any part of it "			2
i had too much respect for the game			2
' speaking out : @entity0 says players offered bribes must tell bosses the 41 - year - old @entity0 , who played seven one - day internationals for @entity38 in early 2007 , quit the game four years later and now coaches at @entity40 in @entity41 , told no - one about @entity2 's approach other than his mum , his then girlfriend and a couple of mates , who advised him to put it out of his mind and get on with his career			1
he did precisely that , without ever feeling entirely comfortable - until he was contacted out of the blue by the @entity52 's anti-corruption unit last year , then interviewed by police			1
the immediate feeling was relief			2
and , now that @entity2 's testimony to the @entity58 's own anti-corruption officials has been laid bare , @entity0 feels able to talk in detail for the first time about the day , six years ago , that threatened to turn his life upside down			1
hitting out : @entity0 in that 2008 @entity5 game for @entity3 against @entity6 @entity65 's @entity64 has ordered a full investigation into corruption in the @entity68 , including the role of @entity70 , the suspended president of the @entity71			1
it follows an initial probe by a three - member team headed by retired judge justice @entity76 that found @entity78 team principal and @entity70 's sonin - law @entity80 guilty of being in contact with illegal bookmakers			1
the panel has been asked to submit its report by the end of august			2
' i was a target , a victim , ' he said			0
' i was in a no - win situation and i still am			0
i do n't deserve it			0
i did n't deserve it			0
i put my heart and soul into cricket , and it was n't to be associated with this			0
i take no satisfaction out of talking to the police last year but , in a weird way , it was a bit of a relief			2
i tackled a major problem deep within my psyche , and it all came out			0
i broke down just talking about it			0
' it was not the first time @entity0 's unwanted brush with cricket 's underworld had reduced him to tears			1
watching the highlights of the @entity3 - @entity6 game that night at home , the stress of the day washed over him			1
' it was the only time i 'd watched the game until the @entity52 officers showed it me again last year			1
' @entity0 's memories of the match remain strikingly vivid , despite the fact that , by his own admission , he had spent the five years until spring 2013 , when the @entity52 contacted him , repressing the experience			1
spotlight : @entity0 was contacted out of the blue by the @entity52 's anti-corruption unit last year ' there were two awkward situations that day which will always live with me , ' he said			1
' we batted first and i was getting my pads on , clear in my mind that i 'd never been so determined in my life to get to @entity132 and i walked out to open the batting , i turned , fully padded up , to look at my team - mates , who were pumped up and ready to go			0
it was a big , big game for us , and i felt this guilt towards them that i 'd never felt before			0
it was the first time it hit me			0
' as we walked out to open together , i was n't 100 per cent sure that @entity132 would be up to something , but i knew after the first over			0
that was the other awkward situation			0
' we met in the middle after it had been bowled , and @entity29 just said : " you know what i 've got to do			0
" ' to get through that day - then the whole thing came flooding back watching the highlights that evening on @entity149			0
and then i moved on			0
' failing to report an approach was not the misdemeanour in 2008 that it is now , and @entity0 attempted to rationalise @entity2 's behaviour by putting it partly down to his struggles with depression			1
but he suspects now that @entity2 targeted him because he was going through problems of his own , of a personal nature at home , and with his testimonial season , at a time when the recession meant people were keeping their hands in their pockets			0
' the only time i felt angry with @entity29 was when it hit me that he probably knew how vulnerable i was , ' said @entity0			1
' it was my naivety			0
i genuinely thought he was trying to do me a favour			0
' against @entity6 , in one of three county games now under the @entity58 's scanner , @entity2 fulfilled his side of the faustian pact , steering @entity175 towards a second slip to depart for one from five balls			1
' it was brilliant how he did it , ' remembered @entity0 , who went on to smash 53 from 37 deliveries , ending for ever the possibility that anyone might one day conclude he had been tempted by @entity2 's offer			1
dark hour : new zealander @entity2 ( front ) has made allegations of corruption in the county game he said : ' it 's one reason why i 'd like to speak to @entity29 now			2
if i 'd nicked off for less than 10 , where would that have put me ? ' everyone would have looked at me in a completely different light			2
' why does he think @entity2 got involved ? ' he probably got himself into a serious hole			0
' my gut feeling is that he was quite angry with the game , which was financially not as rewarding as other sports			0
' out of line : @entity2 threw his wicket in matches but on this occasion against @entity3 in a @entity5 quarter - final , defied his paymasters what advice would @entity204 now offer a cricketer who received a similar approach ? ' i put it out of my head , ' he said			1
' yet here we are , six years down the line , and it 's out there			2
' as soon as you get approached , you tell someone - and tell the right people			0
those right people have to be made clear to the players			0
' the @entity218 are doing a great job , and the @entity52 were brilliant with me , but i still think the counties could do more			1

playing for @entity3 in 2008 , @entity0 was offered bribe to score fewer than 10 runs against @entity6 in @entity5 match
@entity0 forgot *episode* until he was contacted out of the blue by the @entity52 's anti-corruption unit last year
@entity0 has urged cricketers to contact their bosses if they are offered bribes
