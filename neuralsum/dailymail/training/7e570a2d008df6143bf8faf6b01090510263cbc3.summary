senior figures are urging mr @entity2 to adopt a ‘ fortress strategy ’ to protect the party ’s existing seats , rather than trying to continue to compete as a national force			1
one @entity6 member of the government told the @entity17 that the party , which is languishing in fourth place in the opinion polls , is on course to lose half its seats , with female mps disproportionately affected			1
‘ you can see how 30 colleagues can survive , but the other 27 ? it ’s very difficult , ’ he said			0
‘ we need a fortress strategy right now			1
if it ’s a choice between employing a local campaigner on £ 20,000 or spending the money on focus grouping a new national policy we should be doing the former			0
but at the moment we ’re not			0
‘ everyone knows we have n’t got enough women but the situation could be far worse after next year			0
if we do n’t start to do something about it now we could be left with none			0
’ the warning is a fresh blow to mr @entity2 who is already reeling from criticism of his handling of sex scandals involving the party ’s former chief executive @entity47 and @entity50 mp @entity49			1
several disgusted activists have urged women to abandon the party in protest at the leadership ’s failure to take tougher action against @entity47 over claims he made unwanted sexual advances against women			2
mr @entity2 has so far proved unable to extract even an apology from the peer , who denies wrongdoing and is threatening to sue the party unless his membership is reinstated			1
five of the @entity6 ’ seven women mps have majorities of around 2,000 or less , suggesting they will be wiped out by the national swing against the party which has taken place since it entered coalition with the conservatives			1
only international development minister @entity73 , with a majority of just under 8,000 , has a notionally safe seat , although she is likely to face a fierce battle to survive against @entity77 in her north @entity79 constituency			0
equalities minister @entity80 , who has a majority of just over 2,000 , is being urged to do the ‘ chicken run ’ from @entity83 , in @entity84 , to the relatively safety of @entity86 , where veteran chief whip @entity87 is standing down			2
@entity73 has a majority of just under 8,000 but is likely to face a fierce battle to survive against @entity77 in her north @entity79 constituency			0

the couple have just had a baby and colleagues are suggesting she could present the relocation as being for family reasons			0
until recently the @entity6 hierarchy believed it could hold on to at least 45 of its 57 seats			1
aides to mr @entity2 believed the party would receive some credit for its part in the coalition ’s economic policies			1
but despite the economic recovery the @entity6 remain anchored at just 10 per cent in the opinion polls			2
the call for a ‘ fortress strategy ’ is the first sign of panic in senior @entity6 ranks about the party ’s electoral plight			1
although the polls suggest the party could play a role in another coalition after the next election , senior figures believe its role would be greatly diminished			2
one source said : ‘ the polls still show we can hold the balance of power			2
but holding the balance with25 or 30 mps , how much influence are we going to have in any new coalition ? we ’re not going to be able to demand four cabinet ministers , that ’s for sure			0
