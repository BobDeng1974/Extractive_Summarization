the manager works in different ways than i have maybe seen before			2

experience : @entity0 was in charge of @entity5 's last four league games last season brilliant : @entity0 has been lucky enough to play under one of the best managers ever at @entity5 ' it would have been stranger and more difficult if i did n't have the games that i did at the end of last season			1
