and campaigning for the @entity28 presidential nomination , she pushed back hard			0
' i 'm ready for that			0
i know that that comes , unfortunately , with the territory			0
' she is making her first campaign visit this year to @entity17 , a state beloved by the @entity21 family for giving both her faltering 2008 effort and her husband 's struggling 1992 campaign a second wind			1
she also took issue with economic views expressed by members of her own party , offering a dark assessment of a ' stalled out ' @entity67 recovery , a judgment at odds with president @entity71 's brighter view of what the nation has achieved on his watch			0
' it 's not enough just to tread water , ' she said			0
not @entity77 : a lone protester vented his spleen at the @entity80 while @entity21 held a roundtable inside in a traditional @entity28 stand , she voiced her strong support for @entity85 , a program some @entity2 are eager to trim back , describing it as ' not a luxury ' but ' a necessity			2
' standing in front of wooden pallets and boxes of furniture parts , @entity21 was asked by reporters about @entity94 's coming book , ' @entity95 : the @entity96 and @entity97			1
' the book argues that the @entity21 family got speaking fees and donations in return for favors to various foreign interests doled out while she was secretary of state			1
sen. @entity106 , a 2016 @entity2 candidate , said that would make people ' question whether she ought to run for president			2

she stepped down from the organization 's board within hours of announcing her campaign			0
the foundation has come under scrutiny for accepting foreign contributions , including from @entity123 nations that deny equal rights for women			0
some also are on the front lines in the fight against terrorism			0
last week , the foundation revised its policy to permit donations from six @entity67 allies in @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity134 but to bar giving from other nations			2
the charity supports public health , climate change and anti-poverty programs			0
@entity21 campaign aides and supporters moved quickly to discredit @entity94 after word of his book emerged , casting him as a @entity2 operative working to defeat her			1
scooby sighting : @entity21 's campaign van made an appearance in @entity35 , @entity17 on tuesday morning a few takers : @entity21 shook hands with staffers at @entity151 on monday in @entity18 , @entity17 â€“ but some kitchen workers did n't want to come out to meet her @entity94 is president of the @entity154 , a conservative organization , and has advised @entity2 politicians on foreign policy			1
' he 's cherry picked information that 's been disclosed and woven a bunch of conspiracy theories about it , ' @entity21 campaign chairman @entity157 said on @entity163			2
though nearly two dozen republicans are competing for their party 's nomination , the @entity2 candidates have largely focused their criticism on @entity21			1
