by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:15 pm on 3rd august 2011 resigned : @entity2 has quit as the compliance officer at @entity4 after his controversial comments over keeping expenses investigations secret the chief of the commons expenses watchdog has quit just over a week after he was roundly criticised for refusing to name mps being investigated for dubious claims			1
@entity2 has resigned as the @entity4 's ( @entity4 ) compliance officer with immediate effect			1
the move followed an interview last week in which mr march argued that details of his probes should remain secret			2
he said it would be ' unfair ' to identify mps before allegations were proved , and suggested there should be no publicity at all if they were cleared			2
mr march appeared to be contradicting transparency guidelines set by @entity4 , which indicate that politicians should be identified when a formal probe is launched , and cases should be heard in public where possible			1
a statement on the body 's website revealed that mr march , who had only been in the post two months , tendered his resignation last wednesday			0
in a letter to chairman sir @entity36 , he wrote : ' as i explained during our conversation , after much thought and with a good deal of regret , i have come to the conclusion that the role of compliance officer for @entity4 is not the right role for me			1
' on that basis , i have decided that the sensible thing for me to do is to resign the post			0
' sir @entity36 replied : ' thank you for your letter of july 27 and for notice of your resignation from the post of compliance officer			1
the new politics : @entity4 was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal that rocked @entity59 ' i accept , with regret , and understand your conclusion that the role is not the right one for you			2
i know you did not reach this conclusion lightly or hastily			0
' @entity65 , previously @entity4 's head of governance , has now become its third compliance officer in little more than a year			1
he will fill in for six months until a permanent successor can be found			0
ex-raf officer @entity69 was given the post on an interim basis when @entity4 took charge of @entity74 expenses after the @entity75			1
mr march was part - way through probes into a number of @entity19 ' @entity80 democrat @entity79 is the only named subject so far			0
he disclosed the fact himself in may , and the case was later dropped			0
@entity84 , chief executive of the @entity85 , said : ' after the @entity89 one of the crucial principles behind the new system was transparency			0
' taxpayers have a right to know if an mp is being investigated , equally it should be made public if the probe amounts to nothing , or if the error was @entity4 's			2
' public trust in @entity59 and the expenses system is still fragile and it would be unacceptable for allegations of dubious claims to be swept under the carpet , or for investigations to be conducted in secret			0
