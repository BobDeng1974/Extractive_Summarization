once he had dismissed defeat as an unfortunate ‘ anomaly ’ and , childishly , the fault of the ball boys , @entity0 sought necessary to declare what his team had failed to prove on the pitch – ‘ we are better than anybody else ’			1
the @entity11 table , of course , supports his assertion			2
but , for the second successive weekend in the @entity15 , the @entity14 boss was on the defensive			1
five points have been surrendered at @entity18 and now @entity19 , the gap to @entity21 shrunk from eight to three			1
‘ we are top of the league , ’ he said			1
‘ nobody has done better than us			2
everyone would like to be in our position			0
so we are more than fine			0
we are better than anybody else			0
’ but they were not better than @entity19 , proof that resistance resides within a league which many expected them to waltz through undefeated			1
in the course of seven days , @entity46 - who stifled the league leaders in a goalless draw - and @entity50 have co-authored the manual on how to contain and expose the title favourites - it should be on the wish - list of every top - flight manager this @entity55			1
@entity56 can only watch on as @entity29 's strike hits the back of the @entity14 net at @entity60 @entity29 tucks away his second goal against @entity14 on saturday - a huge three points for @entity19 @entity0 , though , will not be penning the foreword in support of the uprising			1
it is as simple as that			0
the team that tried to win , lost , ’ he sounded			2
@entity0 has never won in the @entity11 at @entity60 , losing three times and drawing once ’ for people like me who have been in football for so long you have to accept this anomaly			1
‘ @entity19 did what they always do			1
they tried to counter attack when it was possible			0
this is the way they play against us			0
’ @entity0 ’s gripe was not merely confined to the grown men on the pitch , but also the young boys around its perimeter			1
bizarrely , he criticised the speed at which they returned the ball – at one point , two appeared - as the visitors chased parity during what was a generous helping of six minutes added time , insisting that he himself would never encourage such tactics			2
@entity0 looked frustrated on the bench at @entity60 , but insisted his side are still the best rookie goalkeeper @entity99 ( left ) celebrates with his @entity19 team - mates after they beat @entity14 the excuse lacked substance and , indeed , class			1
‘ things were happening that the referee can not control , ’ he said			0
‘ he can not punish the ball boy that disappears			2
‘ you may as well put a cow in the middle of the pitch , walking			0
and then stop the game because there was a cow			2
you can not do just anything in football			0
you have to defend with your 10 men , put the 10 in front of the goal line , bring the bus , but football needs a ball , not two or zero			2
do what you can to win , but not everything			0
’ if the attack was designed to deflect attention from his players , it worked			0
but amid all of the bull about cows and ball boys , it should not be forgotten that @entity14 ’s offensive threat has gone cold in the chill of @entity136 and @entity137			1
on saturday they could not break down a team which included second - choice goalkeeper @entity140 and then his rookie understudy @entity99 , and was also reduced to 10 men following @entity143 ’s dismissal			2
@entity0 also praised the @entity19 supporters at @entity60 , labelling them a ' good , good crowd ' the scorer of @entity19 ’s goals , @entity29 , has been troubled by injury problems of late but was still too sharp for @entity56 and @entity149 in poaching his match - winning brace			1
@entity152 , meanwhile , has scored just one in four since returning from a hamstring layoff and the @entity156 - born striker was shackled by @entity158 @entity157 at @entity60			1
the recent absence was designed to rid him of his lingering fitness issues but has instead stalled the momentum which saw him smash 10 goals in his first 12 games			0
@entity0 concedes his £ 32million marksman is not firing right now			1
‘ he has to improve his condition , ’ he said			0
‘ he was injured , he had many doubts and he had a long time without training and that obviously must have an effect on a player – the way he runs , the way he moves , his coordination			0
he has to recover but i do n't think there is any problem			0
for me , the problem is not the goals			0
the goals will come as a consequence of his condition			0
’ @entity0 looked disappointed during his interview with @entity183 after the game , bemoaning the ball boys @entity186 accepts ' unlucky ' defeat last week , at @entity18 , @entity14 also failed to take all three points after a 0 - 0 draw at the @entity190 @entity0 , it appears , will wait for @entity152 to come good , evidenced by his decision to restore him to the starting xi ahead of midweek scorers @entity195 and @entity196 , who headed hope of a comeback following his second - half introduction			1
it was , though , in vain and @entity14 - who entertain @entity203 on wednesday having already qualified for the @entity205 knockout rounds - must now bid for a return to winning ways in the league at home to struggling @entity210 next weekend			1
@entity0 was critical of the atmosphere inside @entity212 last month , likening it to an ‘ empty stadium ’			1
but that was one concession he was prepared to make about the passion and noise at @entity60 ’			1
‘ they are a good , good crowd , ’ he said			0
‘ they are very enthusiastic			0
that is their way of living the game			2
’ at last there was a touch of humility to accompany defeat			2
at this point , however , he chose to cut short his post-match reflection - praise for anyone other than his players is not something which rests easy with @entity0			1
for they , at least according to him , are still better than anybody else .			0

@entity14 lost their first game of the season against @entity19 on saturday
the gap to @entity21 at the top has shrunk from eight to three in a week
@entity0 said after the game that nobody is better than @entity14
@entity0 also blamed the @entity60 ball boys for the defeat
read : @entity21 could be level on points with @entity14 by the @entity252
