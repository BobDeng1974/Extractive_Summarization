by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 12:06 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 12:06 est , 19 september 2012 a @entity4 sheriff and his deputies routinely discriminated against @entity6 - a group he referred to as ' taco eaters ' - by making unwarranted arrests with the goal of ramping up deportations , according to a two - year probe by the @entity14 @entity13			1
in an 11 - page report issued tuesday , the federal agency said @entity18 sheriff @entity17 and his deputies violated the constitutional rights of @entity14 citizens and legal residents by illegally targeting , stopping , detaining and arresting @entity23 without probable cause			1
the agency also said that @entity17 obstructed the federal investigation launched in 2010 by withholding requested documents and falsifying records			0
discrimination : sheriff @entity30 of @entity18 , @entity4 , has been accused of rampant discrimination against @entity23 in his jurisdiction , and calling them ' taco eaters ' federal investigators said members of the department also feared retaliation if they cooperated with them			1
the report outlined a list of steps to end discrimination by the department , including remedial training , new internal procedures for recognising and investigating civil rights violations and community outreach			2
if the county fails to reach a negotiated settlement , the @entity13 could take the county to federal court			2
charges : @entity17 's department is accused of illegally targeting , stopping , detaining and arresting @entity23 without probable cause @entity13 officials did n't immediately respond to a request for comment on whether their probe could result in criminal charges			1
a @entity60 who was first elected in 2002 , @entity17 suggested the probe was a political , and cast blame on the @entity63			0
sheriff @entity17 said on tuesday : ' we have never discriminated against @entity67 - speaking persons in any way , shape or form			0
the @entity72 administration has decided to continue to wage war on local law enforcement			0
' according to the federal report , @entity17 referred to @entity23 as ' taco eaters ' prone to drinking , drug dealing and other crimes			1
he ordered special roadblocks in neighborhoods were @entity23 live , during which those with brown skin were stopped while whites were waved through			0
@entity17 also ordered his deputies to arrest motorists who appeared @entity6 - even for minor traffic infractions - while letting white drivers off with warnings , according to the report			1
his deputies , in turn , were as much as 10 times more likely to stop @entity6 drivers than @entity93 , according the federal review of the department 's traffic stop records			1
@entity6 make up only 11 per cent of the county 's population			2
@entity18 lies about an hour 's drive northwest of @entity100 and has around 150,000 residents , according to @entity14 @entity103 figures			2
' if you stop a @entity106 , do n't write a citation , arrest him , ' the sheriff is quoted as telling supervisors within his department , according to the report			2
denial : @entity17 , left , says the @entity13 probe is political , and blames the @entity72 administration in public statements , the sheriff credited his crackdown with decreasing the population of @entity23			1
' their values are a lot different - their morals - than what we have here , ' @entity17 was quoted as saying in a 2007 newspaper article cited in the federal report			2
' in @entity106 , there 's nothing wrong with having sex with a 12 - or 13 - year - old girl			1
' a spokesman for the sheriff , @entity130 , denied the sheriff had ever used the term ' taco eaters			0
' he conceded the 2007 quote was accurate , but said it was made in the context of a local prostitution bust involving underage girls			0
@entity17 was a vocal proponent of the federal 287 ( g ) program initiated during president @entity143 's administration that allowed local law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of those placed under arrest			0
behind the report : assistant attorney general @entity148 , signed the @entity13 probe , which alleges discrimination in @entity18 following widespread complaints of racial profiling , the @entity151 announced earlier this this year it was discontinuing the program to instead focus on deporting illegal immigrants arrested for serious crimes			1
tuesday 's report , signed by assistant attorney general @entity148 , outlines numerous statements and incidents that @entity148 says show prejudice against @entity23			2
' the discriminatory conduct we observed is deeply rooted in a culture that begins with sheriff @entity17 and permeates the entire agency , ' said @entity148 , who oversees the agency 's civil rights division			0
' while sheriff @entity17 often justifies ( his department 's ) activities by citing his desire to combat illegal immigration , we conclude that @entity173 bias motivates his selection and enforcement of enforcement priorities			0
' justice officials say @entity17 tried to stonewall their probe , ordering his staff to speak with federal investigators only with his department 's lawyer present			1
the federal agency filed a complaint in @entity185 last year seeking to compel interviews without the sheriff 's lawyer present , saying staff members had expressed concern @entity17 or others would retaliate against them if they talked			1
that complaint was dismissed at the government 's request tuesday as the @entity13 issued its findings , making the issue moot			0
@entity17 said tuesday he and his staff had ' cooperated fully ' with the @entity13 , providing tens of thousands of pages of documents			0
ultimatum : if @entity18 fails to reach a settlement on how to end discrimination outlined in @entity148 's report , the @entity13 , led by attorney general @entity202 , right , could take the county to federal court ' the only thing we have refused to do is to deprive our deputies of their constitutional right to have an attorney present during interrogation by the @entity13 , ' @entity17 said			1
a 2012 study by a professor at the @entity214 at @entity215 suggested racial profiling is a statewide problem			0
focus : the report charges that the discrimination alleged in @entity18 is rooted with @entity17 , whose four - year term expires in 2014 analyzing data recorded from more than 13 million traffic stops by @entity4 law enforcement officers between 2000 and 2011 , the study reported that @entity23 are 96 per cent more likely than whites to have their vehicles searched during a traffic stop , while blacks are 77 per cent more likely to be searched than whites			1
the federal investigation found @entity17 's deputies attempted to hide how many @entity23 they were stopping and arresting by ' vastly underreporting ' under a state law requiring records to be kept of all traffic stops and misclassifying many latinos booked into the county jail as black			1
the @entity4 chapter of the @entity14 of @entity241 issued a public plea tuesday that motorists around the state come forward if they believe they are the victims of racial profiling			0
' we have been receiving troubling reports of discriminatory policing by the @entity249 for years , ' said @entity250 , the legal director of the @entity241 of @entity4			0
' the findings released today confirm our fear that such discriminatory tactics are a systemic problem			0
we call on @entity18 to work with the @entity13 to promptly adopt comprehensive policies addressing the pervasive pattern and culture of unconstitutional discrimination			1
' @entity148 suggested the actions of @entity17 and his deputies were not only illegal , but impeded the ability of the @entity18 officers to solve serious crimes by sowing distrust within the community and making @entity23 scared to call law enforcement			2
the sheriff 's current 4 - year term expires in 2014			1
' constitutional policing and effective law enforcement go hand - in - hand , ' @entity148 said in the report			0
' biased policing makes the job of police officers harder , not easier			0
