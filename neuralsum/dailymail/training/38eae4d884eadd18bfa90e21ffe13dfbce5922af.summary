responding in the @entity16 to the @entity18 backbencher and former @entity20 colonel @entity19 , the prime minister said he wanted to target militants within mosques and universities who were guilty of radicalising potential terrorists			1
mr @entity19 , a former commander of @entity27 forces in @entity28 during the @entity30 conflict , addressing mr @entity3 , said : ‘ terrorists hide , come from and are sustained by groups of people around them			2
‘ could i ask if you will ensure that the taskforce for tackling extremism puts quite a lot of effort to trying to isolate these misguided people away from those that allow them to operate and sustain them ? ’ mr @entity3 replied : ‘ i think you are absolutely right			1
it is not simply enough to target and go after violent extremists after they ’ve become violent			0
we have to drain the swamp in which they inhabit			0
‘ and that means looking at the process of radicalisation on our campuses , it means looking at @entity13 centres that have been taken over by extremists and gone wrong , it means looking at those mosques who are struggling to throw out the extremists and to help them in the work they are doing			1
‘ it means going through all of these elements of the conveyor belt to radicalisation and making sure we deal with them			2
most significantly , he insisted the main political parties must come to an agreement on what should be done about the @entity87 , which gives police and security services greater access to internet communications			0
students : education secretary @entity93 ( left ) and business secretary @entity94 have been told to examine what more can be done to tackle extremist views in schools and universities he said 95 per cent of serious crimes now involved the use of modern communications technology and it was vital to update the law			1
such a change is opposed by the @entity105 and has been branded a ‘ snooper ’s charter ’ by critics			0
a new @entity109 committee on tackling radicalisation will consider moves to help mosques that want to expel extremists and recruit imams who understand @entity14			2
and it will look at tightening the rules on charities which critics say allow extremist groups to flourish , and at powers to disrupt groups that incite hatred or violence			0
