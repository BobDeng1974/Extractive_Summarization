a @entity1 law professor named with prince @entity2 in a ' sex slave ' case today insisted that he never saw anything improper at the home of their billionaire pedophile friend , @entity7			1
@entity10 's claims on thursday came just one day after accuser @entity11 said in new court filings that the lawyer would chat with @entity7 as she performed a sex act on the billionaire			1
speaking in an emphatic interview on the today show , @entity10 again accused @entity11 of ' making the whole thing up ' and said her lawyers are putting ' real ' rape victims ' in a terrible position '			1
' i was never in the presence of a single underage woman , ' he said			2
' i never saw [ @entity7 ] doing anything improper			1
i was not a witness			0
i was not a participant			0
and i will prove it			0
on wednesday , she lodged fresh documents in @entity37 detailing the alleged abuse she suffered at the duke 's hands , including how she had an orgy with him and eight other young girls			0
but on thursday , @entity10 said that , while @entity11 claims she had sex with him at @entity7 's @entity45 and his @entity47 ranch , he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter			1
he claims that the third accusation - that he had sex with @entity11 on a private plane - is false and that flight manifests will prove he was never aboard the plane with her			1
' i 've ever seen her and i 've never met her , ' he insisted			0
' she is categorically lying and making the whole thing up ... this is @entity60 's nose growing longer and longer			0
' he insisted that his relationship with @entity7 had been entirely ' academic ' and that he had only ever met with him in the presence of dignitaries and professors			1
he added that , despite her lawyers ' claims , he has agreed to be deposed so that he can speak about the allegations			2
together : @entity10 said any legal success he has against the woman , @entity11 ( pictured with prince @entity2 ) , will work in the royal 's favour as it will discredit his accuser @entity76 : @entity11 says she was just 17 when she was forced to have sex with @entity7 's friends ' of course i will be deposed , he said			1
' i have been absolutely upfront			0
the lawyers are lying through their teeth when they say i have refused to be deposed			0
' ' i 'm happy to have this out in a court of law ... i 'm afraid of nothing , i 'm hiding nothing			0
she is afraid of repeating this in public			0
' speaking of @entity11 ' lawyers , he went on : ' they have put rape victims in a terrible position ... because when i unequivocally prove that they sat down and made this all up , tragically it will hurt real rape victims , and it should n't because you should n't generalize			1
' @entity10 has previously urged the @entity2 to fight back against claims the woman made that she was forced to have sex with the royal while she was a minor in the state of @entity37			1
prince @entity2 is expected to comment about the accusations later on thursday , in what would be an unprecedented move for a royal			1
the palace previously issued a vehement denial on prince @entity2 's behalf			1
' it is emphatically denied that the @entity2 had any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity11 , ' a spokesperson said			1
' the allegations made are false and without any foundation			2
' @entity11 called the denial ' false and hurtful to me '			2
following her most recent filing , a @entity123 spokesman added this week : ' we have nothing to say in addition to our earlier comments on the issue			2
' old friends : prince @entity2 came under fire after he was pictured with @entity7 following his prison term in 2011 @entity11 claims she had sex with the prince , a former friend of @entity7 , in @entity136 , @entity137 and the @entity138 while she was a ' sex slave '			1
@entity123 has denied all allegations			2
in the documents , she said her lawyers had served a letter on the @entity2 last week requesting he answer questions â€“ but he ' refused ' to accept it			2
she also described the alleged abuse in new and startling detail			0
she claimed prince @entity2 correctly guessed she was just 17 when he met her , and how she was instructed to give him anything he wanted			1
his police bodyguards left her alone with him the first time they had sex , she said			0
' @entity7 made me have sex with prince @entity2 several times , ' she said			1
' i had sex with him three times , including one orgy			0
i knew he was a member of the @entity160 , but i just called him ' @entity161			0
' after they had sex , she was paid $ 15,000 , she said			0
prince @entity2 's decision to pursue legal action - he has the right to sue his accuser - will depend on whether the @entity123 is willing to subject him to depositions about his private life			1
anger : @entity10 slammed his accuser 's lawyers , @entity174 ( left ) and @entity175 ( right ) , for naming him in the lawsuit			2
he claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied but @entity10 said his extensive legal action would be beneficial to prince @entity2 as it would serve to discredit his accuser			1
earlier this month , he filed a sworn statement in @entity37 and defamation suits in both @entity137 and the @entity183 based on @entity11 ' lawyers ' public statements about the case			2
he has also challenged them to sign sworn statements repeating their charges			0
@entity10 has also filed a motion in federal court to enter in a lawsuit brought against the @entity183 government by his accuser and other women who say @entity7 sexually abused them			1
the court has yet to decide whether to grant his motion			0
the two lawyers representing @entity199 # 3 , former federal judge @entity175 and @entity37 plaintiffs attorney @entity174 , have now filed counter-defamation charges against @entity10			2
in an earlier article , he explained that this will subject them and their client to sworn depositions			0
if they repeat the charges under oath , and if they are untrue , they will be subject to prosecution for perjury			0
support : @entity10 's wife @entity213 ( pictured with their daughter ) , has spoken out in support of her husband in a previous statement to @entity219 , mr @entity175 said that he and mr @entity174 would not be responding to ' specific claims of indignation by anyone '			0
' we have been informed of mr @entity10 's threats based on the factual allegations we have made in our recent filing , ' he said in a statement			1
' we carefully investigate all of the allegations in our pleadings before presenting them ... we would be pleased to consider any sworn testimony and documentary evidence mr @entity10 would like to provide which he contends would refute any of our allegations			2
' finally , @entity10 has also challenged his accuser to file formal rape charges against him			0
if she were to file a false rape charge , she would be committing a crime			0
she has not done so			0
it comes a week after prince @entity2 's ex-wife @entity240 slammed reports that he had sex with an underage girl as ' salacious lies ' and defended him as a ' humongously good man '			1
in a passionate rebuttal on the today show last tuesday , the @entity240 said that she was standing by ' my best friend and my best ex-husband ever ' amid the allegations			1

@entity10 was named by @entity11 , who says she was just 17 when she had sex with friends of pedophile @entity7
in new filings , she said @entity10 chatted with @entity7 while she performed a sex act on him
on the today show on thursday , @entity10 said he was never in the presence of underage girls or saw anything improper around @entity7

@entity123 has issued *strongly* - worded denials of the allegations
