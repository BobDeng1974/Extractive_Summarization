by @entity1 reporter published : 07:54 est , 30 november 2013 @entity3 : 07:54 est , 30 november 2013 it is already used to help prevent heart attacks and strokes , and now researchers believe the humble aspirin could also hold the key to warding off dementia and cancer			1
the claim came yesterday at the launch of the largest ever study into the health benefits of the everyday medicine , which has long been thought of as a health - booster			2
a study of 15,000 people aged over 70 will be the most extensive clinical trial on the use of aspirin to prevent disease in the elderly			1
life - saver : aspirin is already used to prevent strokes and heart attacks and now researchers have discovered it could also help fight off cancer and dementia research team leader professor @entity33 , from @entity35 ’s @entity34 in @entity36 , @entity37 , said : ' remember aspirin is an over-the - counter medication ; you do n’t need a doctor to prescribe it , you do n’t need a doctor to tell you you ’ve turned 70			1
so this is something that can be done very simply , very cheaply if we find that it ’s an effective strategy			2
' prof @entity33 said the study starts next summer and results are expected in 2018			2
millions of people who take the pill to fight heart disease or the risk of a stroke benefit from its effectiveness at thinning the blood and how it helps to prevent clotting			1
it cuts the danger of further heart attacks or strokes by at least 23 per cent			1
hope : the research could pave the way for a breakthrough in preventing the onset of dementia , which affects thousands of elderly people ( file picture ) research has shown regular users have a lower risk of developing alzheimer ’s disease , the main form of dementia			1
scientists believe its protective effect may be due to its anti-clotting action helping blood flow to the brain			2
prof @entity33 said : ' there ’s a number of reasons why it might			0
the number one reason would be related to stroke			0
if you have a stroke you knock out a large area of your brain and therefore your ability to think is affected			0
' there is also the possibility of lots of what are called microinfarcts , which means small areas of brain getting knocked off very slowly			0
' research has also shown that aspirin may have a role in fighting cancer , particularly gastro - intestinal cancers			1
wonder drug : it is hoped taking the pills could also stave off cancers in the gastro - intestinal tract prof @entity33 said : ' there ’s some very good evidence around to suggest aspirin may prevent cancers , especially cancers of the gastro - intestinal tract			2
' now that makes sense because you take it orally so in aspirin you ’ve got that natural component			0
' in the study – in the journal @entity120 – the team wants to establish whether the benefits of a low dose of aspirin outweigh the risks linked to its use			0
prof @entity33 said : ' if you ’ve never had a heart attack or stroke before , what ’s called primary prevention , we really do n’t know in an elderly population whether you ’re more likely to get benefit from taking the aspirin , maybe related to stroke or heart attack			1
' or more likely to be harmed , because aspirin actually can cause an increase in your risk of haemorrhagic stroke , bleeding type strokes and it can also cause bleeding into the stomach			1
' he cautioned about the ' @entity146 ' of aspirin , which can also lead some people to have a major stroke because of increased blood flow			0
@entity152 research chief dr @entity151 said : ' we already know that prescribed aspirin has the potential to prevent heart disease and stroke in people at risk of these conditions , and it would be an additional benefit if it could delay the onset of dementia			1
' dr @entity163 of @entity164 said : ' systematic reviews of previous aspirin trials have so far showed no evidence that the drugs can benefit people with dementia , but the studies done to date have been relatively small			0
large - scale controlled trials could provide more conclusive evidence			0
' he added : ' we look forward to seeing the results			0

@entity37 researchers also think the drug could ward off stomach cancer
they are about to carry out clinical trial of 15,000 over- 70s
it is already known to reduce risk of a heart attack by 23 per cent
