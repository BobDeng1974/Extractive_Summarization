by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 used to put the @entity3 on a pedestal			1
the @entity6 prop believes @entity7 have shattered the world champions ’ aura and can beat them here — as long as they rediscover the ability to catch			1
going into this three - test series , the tourists wanted to deconstruct the myth of @entity15 invincibility			2
@entity17 ’s team won all 14 matches they played in 2013 and have lost only once since their @entity20 triumph , at @entity21 in december 2012			1
belief : @entity2 is confident that @entity7 are close to shattering @entity3 's aura of invincibility last week , @entity7 ’s under - strength side went to @entity26 and were not behind on the scoreboard until the 70th minute — or at any time when they had 15 men on the field			1
the outcome was a 20 - 15 win for the @entity3 , but the moral victory belonged to @entity36 ’s men , who dominated in many aspects			1
@entity2 produced a superb performance at loosehead as @entity7 ’s pack gained supremacy in the scrum and had the upper hand in many of the collision areas			1
he was left with the conviction that the @entity48 players are mere mortals who crack under extreme pressure			0
‘ we went into the game having spent the build - up trying to get rid of this @entity3 myth or aura of how they are invincible , ’ said @entity7 ’s no 1			1
‘ we respect them as a team and know they have several world - class players — and they are world champions so we respect them for that			2
but saturday helped us even further to realise , “ actually , we can go toe to toe with these guys ”			0
now we just need to go that extra step			0
’ moral victory : although they lost the first test , @entity36 's @entity7 side were dominant and impressive @entity2 was not among the players with close - quarters experience of seeing @entity3 beaten , having not featured in the record 38 - 21 triumph at home 18 months ago			1
instead , he had continued to nurture the belief that @entity15 supremacy was just a fact of his sport			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve always looked to the @entity3 as year in , year out the best team in the world and you just automatically think they have the best players in the world from one to 15			1
but when you break it down and look at them as individuals and collectively , there are 15 blokes on a field trying to do the same as you			2
a lot of boys in their team are world class , and we respect that , but we have to go out there and give it our best shot			0
’ late pain : @entity101 scored a late try , the only one of the game , to seal victory for @entity3 despite being without so many leading players , that is what @entity7 did at @entity26 and cracks in the black edifice were exposed			1
the aftermath of the tense series opener has been marked by @entity48 accusations that the tourists set out to slow down the match in order to negate the home side ’s high - tempo approach			2
@entity2 dismissed the barbs , saying : ‘ we want to play at a high tempo and we showed that in the @entity127 when we took @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 on at that sort of game			2
‘ i did n’t see them running to any of the scrums or lineouts quicker than us			0
it ’s not a tactic of ours to slow the game down			0
‘ as a spectator or a neutral you ’d probably look at it and ( say ) it was n’t a great game to watch because there were a lot of dropped balls and set - pieces			2
that ’s why the game was slow			0
’ room for improvement : @entity7 can beat @entity3 if they improve their catching , says @entity2 asked if @entity7 would have faith in their fitness in a free - flowing contest — as there is likely to be under the roof in @entity153 — he added : ‘ yes , we ’ll back our fitness , as long as we ’re catching the ball ! ’ any attempt by @entity7 to add pace to their game would be enhanced by the return at scrum - half of @entity161 , who has recovered from a shoulder injury			1
as a @entity6 team - mate @entity2 is well aware of the 27 - year - old ’s threat , and he said : ‘ he ’s that little ball of energy that lifts a game when it has slowed down			1
he does a quick tap , sparks boys and gets forwards round the corner quick			0
’ following the first test , @entity2 revealed on @entity174 that @entity161 — his room - mate — had written him a motivational letter			1
he admitted yesterday that he did n’t see it until the match was over , but appreciated the gesture nonetheless			0
‘ i received it after the game , ’ he said			0
‘ i got back to the room and saw this letter on the bed			0
i said , “ @entity185 , what ’s this ? ”			0
he started laughing and said , “ sorry mate , i did n’t realise you ’d left for the game ”			0
we ’re very close and he ’s an emotional guy			0
’ whether it is by writing letters or dismantling auras , @entity7 are finding ways to make a proper contest of this daunting series			2
sensitive side : @entity161 wrote room - mate @entity2 a motivational letter ahead of the first test			1

@entity7 lost first test in @entity3 by narrow margin of 20 - 15
but @entity3 have only lost once since 2011 @entity20 triumph
@entity2 believes @entity7 are capable of *inflicting* another *defeat*
@entity2 warns @entity7 must improve their catching to beat @entity3
