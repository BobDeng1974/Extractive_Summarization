an eight - year - old schoolboy who dressed as a character from @entity2 for @entity3 was laughed at by teachers , while a second school child was told he could n't take part for wearing the same costume			1
@entity8 pulled on one of his father 's suits and arrived at @entity12 in @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity15 , dressed as @entity2 - where staff found his costume ' funny '			1
however , in @entity19 , @entity18 was ' excluded ' from lessons after teachers at @entity22 branded his outfit , inspired by actor @entity24 , was inappropriate			1
the 11 - year - old pupil was dressed in a shiny grey suit , equipped with cable ties and a face mask			1
@entity24 , ( right ) , played the character in the recent blockbuster hit but @entity8 's 28 - year - old mother , @entity34 , was surprised when she heard @entity18 had been disciplined for the outfit , after her son 's teacher reacted by laughing			1
she said : ' i took him into the classroom and his teacher asked who he was and he said @entity2 and the teacher just started laughing			1
' some of the kids had never heard of him so not many knew who he was dressed as but those who did thought it was funny '			2
miss @entity34 , who has an older daughter , @entity48 , 10 , and a 12 - month - old baby called @entity50 , said the @entity52 pupil came up with the outfit idea himself			1
' he was asking on wednesday about what he could go as for @entity3			0
i 'd done some researching and could n't come up with anything			0
' then he suggested going as @entity2 himself			2
he 'd seen that i had the book and heard me go on about seeing the film			2
' he has n't read the book or seen the film but there are adverts on in the day and he 's asked about it			2
but he thinks it 's about a rich man that owns a big house and a helicopter			1
' @entity8 ( left ) pictured with his mother , @entity34 ( centre ) , sister @entity48 , 10 , ( right ) and 12 - month - old baby brother @entity50 ( in miss @entity34 's arms ) @entity8 asked his father , @entity71 , who is separated from @entity72 , if he could borrow one of his suits			1
after some persuasion the 35 - year - old carer allowed him to wear his black shirt , grey tie and grey trousers			1
' his dad popped in between his work hours with the outfit , but did say he did n't think it was a good idea , but we went ahead with it anyway			2
' most of the parents at the school thought it was funny			2
one or two have made little digs saying he should n't know what that is - but he does n't know what it is			2
' father @entity71 ( centre ) let @entity8 ( right ) borrow one of his shirts and ties to go as @entity98 on thursday			1
sister @entity48 , who is in year 6 , did n't get to dress up for the event @entity100 , 10 , ( left ) with @entity8 ( right ) and their baby brother @entity50 ( centre )			1
when @entity8 arrived at school his teacher , dressed as @entity104 , found the outfit funny the full - time mother said she ' could n't understand ' why staff at @entity22 had taken such drastic action over the costume			1

@entity18 ( pictured ) was told off by teachers after turning up to school dressed as @entity2 - complete with cable ties and a sleeping mask @entity18 , pictured , was told he could n't appear in his class photo wearing the outfit from the controversial movie @entity8 's experience was completely different to @entity18 from @entity22 in @entity19 who also arrived in class dressed as @entity2 from the novel			1
teachers objected when the youngster appeared with cable ties and an eye mask which were both props from the controversial book			2
@entity155 then rang @entity18 's mother @entity156 , who herself is a primary school teacher , to tell her that the outfit was inappropriate			1
she said : ' we thought it was funny			0
we were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as @entity2			1
' at first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea			1
' he went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties			0
the cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them			0
we did n't think there would be a problem			0
' i got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs			1
