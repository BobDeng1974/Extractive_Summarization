by @entity0 published : 13:56 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 20:48 est , 15 november 2013 @entity1 ? supplies of orange juice could be in danger as the @entity6 is considering a ban on @entity9 citrus imports , it has been suggested today the price of orange juice on @entity13 ’s breakfast tables could rise next summer if the @entity6 goes ahead with a ban on @entity9 citrus imports			1
the move follows the interception of 35 citrus shipments this year from the chief summer supplier to @entity20 that were contaminated with fungal black spot disease			1
with growers in southern @entity20 fearing it could take hold in their citrus groves , the @entity22 is drawing up plans for a ban that could be adopted by the end of november			1
@entity6 trade chief @entity30 told @entity9 officials during a visit to @entity33 this week that the contaminated shipments were ' serious and problematic ' and that a response was needed			0
@entity9 exports about 600,000 tons of citrus fruit – mainly oranges , lemons , limes and tangerines – to the @entity6 each year and the industry is worth 1 billion euros			1
it is the main source of orange juice drunk in @entity13 , @entity44 and @entity45 during the summer months			1
for now the planned citrus ban would be largely symbolic , as it would apply only to this year ’s @entity9 harvest , which ended in october , meaning @entity6 imports have already stopped			2
but the @entity6 's food safety watchdog is currently analysing the situation and if studies show the disease has a risk of taking hold in @entity20 's estimated 500,000 hectares of citrus groves , the ban could be extended			0
while harmless to humans , citrus black spot causes unsightly lesions on the fruit and leaves of affected plants , reducing both harvest quality and quantity			1
there is no known cure , but fungicides can be used to control the spread of the disease			0
disease : there could be a risk of the black spot fungus , pictured , taking hold in @entity20 's citrus groves it is found in many citrus growing regions in the southern hemisphere , but has never established itself in @entity20			1
the dispute comes at as the @entity6 seeks @entity9 's support to unlock stalled trade deals with @entity83			0
during negotiations in @entity9 this week , @entity6 officials offered to improve the terms of a bilateral free - trade deal dating from 1999 by granting @entity9 sugar farmers duty - free access to @entity20 for the first time			0
citrus black spot causes unsightly lesions on the fruit and the leaves of affected plants and therefore reduces both harvest quality and quantity			2
there is no known cure , but fungicides can be used to control the spread of the disease			0
it is found in many citrus growing regions in the southern hemisphere as well as @entity106 and the @entity107 , but has never established itself in @entity20			0
since 2011 , the number of citrus shipments from @entity9 found to contain black spot has averaged about 35 each year			1
following calls by citrus growers in top @entity6 producer @entity114 to take a tougher stance on the issue , the @entity22 said it would be forced take action if more than 5 contaminated shipments were intercepted from the country this year			1
in its draft opinion published in july , the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) said the chance of citrus black spot taking in hold in @entity20 was ' moderately likely '			2
however , it it added there was a high level of uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge over how the disease would respond to the @entity6 climate			0
the @entity121 is due to finalise its assessment by the end of the year			0
@entity6 farm union @entity136 said if the planned ban was confirmed it would be a step in the right direction			0
it also urged the @entity22 to impose restrictions on next year 's @entity9 citrus harvest			2
' what we need is measures for 2014 before imports start again in march , ' @entity136 - @entity136 secretary general @entity143 said in a statement			0
the head of the @entity150 , @entity151 , said any type of ban by the @entity6 would be ' most unfortunate '			0
' global experts have confirmed that citrus black spot is not a risk ( to @entity20 ) , so a ban would seem unnecessary , ' he said			2
since 2011 , the number of citrus shipments from @entity9 found to contain black spot has averaged about 35 each year			1
following calls by citrus growers in top @entity6 producer @entity114 to take a tougher stance on the issue , the @entity22 said it would be forced take action if more than 5 contaminated shipments were intercepted from the country this year			1

however , it it added there was a high level of uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge over how the disease would respond to the @entity6 climate			0
the @entity121 is due to finalise its assessment by the end of the year , and its findings will largely determine what further moves , if any , the @entity22 will take to restrict @entity9 imports			2
but a group of citrus black spot experts from countries affected by the disease said it had identified ' factual errors and omissions ' in @entity121 's draft assessment , and that there was no recorded case of the disease ever having spread via fruit exports .			1

35 citrus shipments from @entity9 found to be contaminated with the fungal black spot disease in the past 12 months
@entity22 thought to be drawing up plans for a ban - which could be implemented by the end of november
