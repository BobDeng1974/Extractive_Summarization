when @entity2 ’s team of experts on the @entity6 show @entity4 examined this seascape , they were convinced they had found a lost masterpiece by @entity9			1
delighted owner @entity10 was told the painting , @entity12 , could be worth as much as £ 250,000 , and a smiling @entity13 declared : ‘ well i do n’t think that could have gone any better really			2
’ but boat experts are now challenging the verdict – claiming the experts made a ‘ glaring mistake ’			0
the original : constable 's painting of @entity12 hangs in the @entity22 during the show , constable specialist @entity23 told @entity13 : ‘ i think there are sufficient things that look like @entity9 that if i had to come down on one side of the line or the other i would say i do think it is a constable			1
’ the painting , which had been stored under a bed for decades , underwent further analysis by @entity33 , a former curator at @entity34 – who said she was ‘ convinced it was likely to have been painted by @entity9 ’			1
however yachting experts say the boats that the painting depicts were not seen in @entity40 waters until almost a century after @entity9 ’s death in 1837			1
presenter and the painter : @entity2 ( left ) was amazed when the @entity4 expert told her the painting could be worth as much as £ 250,000 ; @entity9 ( 1776 - 1837 ) was a romantic painter			1
born in @entity46 , he is famous for his landscape paintings @entity48 , the editor of @entity50 magazine , pointed out that three of the watercraft have a sail and mast arrangement known as a @entity56 rig , first tested in these seas in the 1920s			0
the boat in the middle of the picture also looks like a j class from the 1930s because of its ‘ spoon bow ’ hull , he added			0
speaking to @entity65 , he said : ‘ i do n’t think that @entity9 was blessed with exceptional foresight			0
it seemed as if the @entity6 was intent on proving this was a @entity9 , regardless of the facts			2
’ and @entity69 , an historian at the @entity70 in @entity71 , said : ‘ not only was the rig wrong but the sail colour was n’t authentic either			0
the picture may be technically correct as a painting but i fear the content just is n’t right			0
’ a @entity78 or @entity79 spokesman said : ‘ this information is part of a larger story which we will consider including in future episodes			2
