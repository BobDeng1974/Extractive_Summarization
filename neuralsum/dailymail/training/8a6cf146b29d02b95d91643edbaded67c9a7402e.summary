a 20 - year - old student was told she had a common cold three times before a blood test revealed she was suffering cancer			1
@entity4 , of @entity5 near @entity6 , told doctors she was feeling extremely tired , suffering a raised temperature and had flu - like symptoms			1
she visited @entity10 three times in two weeks			1
but it was n't until her mother demanded a blood test that she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia			1
in the end , on the fourth visit my mum came with me and asked them to carry out a blood test ' the 20 - year - old media student is today urging other young people to look out for the five common signs of the disease as part of a @entity40 campaign			1
she said : ' i had these flu - like symptoms over a two - week period and kept going back and forth to the doctors			2
' i was given different tablets but nothing was really working			0
' the doctor could n't put his finger on what was actually wrong with me			0
' in the end , on the fourth visit my mum came with me and asked them to carry out a blood test			1
' the next day i received a call to go to hospital and was given the bad news			0
' when i was told i had cancer i burst into tears and kept thinking " why me ? "			0
' my first thought was also about my hair and whether i would lose it			0
' i always loved doing different things to my hair and knew i would n't be able to do that			0
' miss @entity4 , who is now in remission following her diagnosis last december , started chemotherapy immediately			1
by april she was given the good news , she was clear of cancer			0
while being treated at the @entity40 unit at @entity67 in @entity6 , she met @entity68 , the teenager who raised millions for the charity in the months before his death			2
miss @entity4 has now finished her treatment , and is back at college			2

miss @entity4 , pictured left with comedian @entity75 , and right while undergoing treatment , started chemotherapy immediately and was in remission by april this year miss @entity4 , pictured with @entity79 , is now encouraging other young people to be alert to the five signs of cancer the five most common signs of cancer in young people aged 13 to 24 are persistent and unexplained pain , extreme tiredness , weight loss , an unexplained lump , bump or swelling or changes in a mole			1
other symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia include : pale skin , breathlessness , having repeated infections over a short space of time , unusual and frequent bleeding ( such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds )			1
easily bruised skin , excessive sweating and bone and joint pain are others			0
the five most common signs of cancer in young people are persistent and unexplained pain , extreme tiredness , weight loss , an unexplained lump , bump or swelling or changes in a mole			0
pictured is acute myeloid leukaemia under the microscope @entity115 is the most common form of blood cancer in children			1
@entity115 is a blood cancer that affects the white blood cells , a really important part of our immune system that fights infection			2
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( @entity126 ) and acute myeloid leukaemia ( @entity128 ) are forms of cancer which affect blood - producing cells in the bone marrow			1
when a child has leukaemia , control of blood cell production breaks down			0
the bone marrow - the soft tissue in the middle of our bones where all our blood cells are made - makes lots of abnormal white blood , or leukaemia cells			2
these never mature into proper white blood cells , vital to a healthy immune system , and so children with leukaemia are at more risk of infection			0
now nine in ten children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( all ) are cured - a remarkable turnaround for a previously untreatable disease			2
the cure rates for children with acute myeloid leukaemia ( @entity128 ) are now around 65 per cent .			1
