at 7:45 et , the goes - 13 satellite captured this full disk image of @entity5 , giving a snapshot of the planet as spring sprung @entity20 ( which mark the onset of spring and autumn ) and solstices ( which mark the beginnings of summer and winter ) are points in time and space that designate a transition in the planet 's annual trip around the sun. the equinox occurs twice a year when the relative angle of @entity5 is perpendicular to the @entity13 , causing equal incoming solar energy to the @entity35 and @entity36 hemispheres - as well as equal day and nighttime			1
the equinox occurs twice a year when the relative angle of @entity5 is perpendicular to the @entity13 , causing equal incoming solar energy to the @entity35 and @entity36 hemispheres - as well as equal day and nighttime			2
after the equinox passed , the @entity39 will be more lit than the @entity40 â€“ causing the seasons			1
' the photo shows both hemispheres equally lit , ' the @entity8 said			0
' as spring wears on , the @entity39 will receive more sun than the @entity40 , creating the familiar seasons in each region ( summer and winter , respectively )			0
the sun in the image is artificially created , though the @entity50 spacecraft does have sensors continually monitoring the @entity13 for solar activity			0
the image gives a stunning view of the @entity5 as the season 's change was created by a @entity3 in the higher latitudes of the @entity39 , the time of ' equal day and night ' occurs a few days before the spring equinox , while in the @entity40 that date comes after the @entity61 , according to the @entity62			2
the dawning of spring comes on different dates ( from march 19 - 21 ) and different times each year as it takes the @entity5 about 365 and one - quarter days to orbit the sun ( which is why we have a leap day every four years )			0
the @entity5 also circles the sun in a slightly non-elliptical orbit , which changes @entity5 's orientation to the sun from year to year .			0
