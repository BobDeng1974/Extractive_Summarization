@entity0 and @entity1 are to go head - to - head in a live debate on @entity4 leaving the @entity5 after the @entity7 leader admitted he had ‘ absolutely no choice ’ but to accept a challenge from the deputy prime minister			1
mr @entity1 threw down the gauntlet to mr @entity0 yesterday , challenging him to a live showdown between the ' party of in ' and the ' party of out '			1
today mr @entity0 said he was ready to debate the ‘ most important issue this country has faced for hundreds of years ’ but called on @entity17 and @entity18 to also take part			1
@entity20 to head : @entity21 leader @entity1 threw down the gauntlet to @entity7 's @entity0 , challenging him to a live debate mr @entity0 repeated his boast that @entity7 could win the elections to @entity26 in may , and hailed the prospect of a debate as proof that his party was now setting the political agenda			1
he said : ' i have spent years being told i am a nutcase so when the deputy prime minister challenged the fruitcakes to engage in a national debate , i am delighted			1
' broadcasters are already queuing up to televise the debate in prime time , pitching mr @entity1 against mr @entity0 ahead of the vote on may 22			1
appealing to the @entity7 leader yesterday , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i 'll tell you what i 'll do			1
i will challenge @entity0 to a public , open debate about whether we should be in or out of the @entity5			1
‘ he is the leader of the party of out , i am the leader of the party of in			0
‘ and i think it 's now time we have a proper public debate so that the public can listen to the two sides of the argument and judge for themselves			2
’ @entity7 refused to give a definitive response , but suggested that mr @entity0 would refuse to go head - to - head with mr @entity1 directly unless @entity58 and the @entity59 also took part			1
it led to the @entity21 accusing mr @entity0 of being a ‘ chicken ’ and running scared from a one - on - one showdown			1
but today mr @entity0 softened the demand for other leaders to be included , and accepted the @entity67 ’s challenge			2
@entity7 said it would be ' ridiculous ' if @entity17 and @entity18 did not take part in the debate he told @entity71 : ‘ i nearly choked on my bacon roll when i heard @entity1 he wanted to have a debate on the big @entity75 question because this was the guy three years ago advocating an in - out referendum who now says there should n’t be a referendum but now wants a debate			1
so he is all over the place			0
‘ i ’ve thought about this overnight … i got involved in politics because i felt on the great question of who governs out country , our own parliament , the men and women we elect and send there or the @entity92 and the other institutions in @entity94 , that we were n’t having a proper talk about this			0
‘ i ’ve battled on for 20 years , i have been laughed at , ridiculed , attacked , but at no point in the 15 that i have now been an mep but at no point have we ever had a full national debate about the merits or demerits of @entity5 membership			1
‘ therefore when the deputy prime minister says he wants to go public and have a debate with me on this issue i have absolutely no choice			2
‘ i ’ve got to say yes because we need to have a national debate on what i think is the most important issue this country has faced for hundreds of years in terms of our constitution so the answer is yes			2
’ but he said he had ‘ one small caveat ’ , adding : ‘ i do really want for the @entity118 in the shape of @entity18 in the shape of the prime minister to join this debate as well			0
‘ so the answer is yes i ’ll do it with @entity1 , but the other two i would like to see them there as well			0
’ @entity7 leader @entity0 was mocked up as a chicken in this picture posted online by @entity21 @entity75 election candidate @entity129 yesterday @entity130 revealed that mr @entity17 had already ruled himself out			1
a @entity132 source said : ' the prime minister is running the country			0
this is an invitation that @entity1 made to @entity0			2
there is only one party that can deliver a referendum on @entity75 and that is the conservatives			0
' but mr @entity0 hit back : ‘ @entity139 have already briefed that @entity17 is too busy running the country			2
‘ but actually mr @entity17 that ’s what the debate is about – who is running the country , are you running it ? is the prime minister who goes to the @entity149 once a week , or is the @entity5 commissioner @entity150 right when she said in @entity151 last week that over 70 per cent of our laws are now made in @entity94 ? ‘ i suspect that @entity17 does not ever want to have this debate			0
‘ i think the splits in the @entity118 between @entity58 and old @entity118 over the @entity75 question have been highlighted by open door immigration , which has n’t just put lots of our youngsters out of work , it is has led to wage compression			0
‘ i suspect that they do n’t want to have the debate so it is @entity1 and i head - to - head			1
let ’s have the debate			0
’ some @entity21 insiders fear the party could be pushed into fifth place at in may 's elections to the @entity26 , behind @entity7 , the @entity137 , @entity58 and even the @entity173			1
@entity21 party president @entity174 has warned the election could see the party lose every one of its seats in the @entity26			1
in 2009 the @entity21 polled almost 14 per cent of the vote , but strategists think it could be halved to just 7 per cent in may			2
at the same time @entity7 has its sights on coming top in the @entity26 elections , ahead of @entity58 and the @entity59 in third			1
the @entity59 have promised to hold an in - out referendum on leaving the @entity5 by 2017 , but mr @entity1 has argued it would create unnecessary uncertainty			0
he will use the @entity75 elections to argue that abandoning the @entity5 would damage jobs in the @entity4 , hamper police in fighting crime , setback the fight against climate change and undermine @entity4 ’s standing in the world			0
however , senior @entity21 fear the elections could see the party wiped out			2
mr @entity174 told activists : ‘ there is one last big test before the general election — thursday , may 22			0
' we defend more than 700 councillors , and [ our ] @entity202 , and at stake are hundreds of campaigners who deserve to win			0
in several councils , we are defending our final foothold , and our very presence in the @entity26 could be at stake			0
‘ it 's not just our party 's place in @entity75 that is at stake , it 's @entity4 's too			0
‘ we know @entity75 needs reform , and the best place to do that is from within			0
only the @entity21 are brave enough to make this argument and put @entity4 jobs and investment first			0

@entity21 leader threw down the gauntlet to @entity7 for a head - to - head debate
@entity0 says he has ' absolutely no choice ' but to accept challenge
has spent 20 years being ' ridiculed ' but is now setting the agenda
debate will be held ahead of may 's @entity26 elections
