@entity0 has called in his lawyers over @entity3 's claim that he converted to @entity4 in a ' phantom ' ceremony more than a decade ago			1
the socialite had said the maverick mp took part in a ' shahadah ' conversion , attended by members of the @entity11 of @entity12			2
mrs @entity3 , who herself became a @entity11 ahead of her failed marriage to cricketer @entity15 , claimed she knows someone who attended the event in north - west @entity18 in an article in the @entity21 magazine			1
but mr @entity0 , who was elected to @entity22 as mp for @entity23 in a by - election last month , angrily denied that any ceremony had taken place			1
war of words : @entity3 , right , wrote that @entity0 , right , converted to @entity4 in a secret ceremony more than a decade ago			1
he has denied ever taking part in such a ceremony last night , he issued a statement saying : ' the further allegations from the @entity21 in response to my rebuttal moves the issue into the area of defamation			1
' @entity3 asked me on tape about this phantom ceremony in @entity43 and i told her it was a lie and whoever told her it was a liar			2
' no trace of this exchange appears in the @entity21 piece , which is predicated upon it			0
now that they are denying my denial it places the matter in the hands of my solicitor			0
' the four times married 57 - year - old had refused to deny claims that he is a @entity11			2
in the media , mr @entity0 has always been widely referred to as a @entity61			1
but the four times married 57 - year - old had refused to deny claims that he is a @entity11			2
in the days before his shock landslide by - election victory last month , a letter - which mr @entity0 denies being behind - went out to voters highlighting his record of support for @entity69 , his work for ' the freedom of @entity72 ' and his abstention from alcohol			1
it added : ' @entity76 knows who is a muslim			0
and he knows who is not			0
' elected : @entity23 mp @entity0 takes his seat in the @entity81 earlier this month for the first time after winning a by - election @entity0 took to @entity84 to angrily deny mrs @entity3 's claim that he converted to @entity4 @entity3 hit back asking ' what 's wrong with being a @entity11 ? ' ms @entity3 , who interviewed the mp in his new constituency , which has a large @entity11 community , started the article : ' @entity0 , mp for @entity23 , is a @entity11			1
' he converted more than ten years ago in a ceremony at a hotel in @entity43 , north - west @entity18 , attended by members of the @entity11 of @entity12			2
' those close to him know this			0
the rest of the world , including his @entity11 constituents , does not			0
' claims : @entity3 's allegations were published in the @entity21 magazine today ms @entity3 tells mr @entity0 she knows someone ' who attended your shahadah ' and says , ' so you converted ? ' according to the article he replied : ' i ca n't answer that			1
@entity76 knows who is a muslim			0
' the interview was carried out as ms @entity3 and mr @entity0 ate a halal meal			1
when being sworn in as an mp mr @entity0 chose to affirm , rather than make the pledge on a religious text			1
he told ms @entity3 : ' people ask me this , why did i affirm in @entity22 when i swore in ? ' the answer is : i had to take an oath of allegiance in which i do n't believe , to the queen and all her heirs and successors , and i have no allegiance to any of them , and i could not possibly swear such a thing on a holy book			2
' so nothing else should be read into the affirmation			0
' mr @entity0 claimed the article was littered with ' deliberate falsehoods ' and ' schoolgirl howlers '			1
he tweeted : ' no such ceremony ever happened , in @entity43 or anywhere else			0
' in a statement he added : ' the opening paragraph of @entity3 's piece in the @entity21 , referring to an alleged conversion ceremony , is totally untrue			2
' moreover i told her it was fallacious when she put it to me			0
i have never attended any such ceremony in @entity43 , @entity143 or @entity144			0
' it is simply and categorically untrue			0
' the @entity21 issued a robust statement in response to mr @entity0 's denial			2
a spokeswoman said : ' it is notable that @entity0 does not deny being a @entity11 convert - and he did not deny it when it was put to him at the time of the interview , which is on tape			1
' contrary to his press release , nor did he deny that the ceremony took place when it was put to him during the interview			0
this is also on tape			0
' furthermore , he failed to clarify how , by his own admission , he had a ' nikah ' ( a @entity11 marriage ceremony ) , despite the fact that a @entity163 man can not marry a @entity11 woman under @entity4 law			0
' confusion : @entity0 , pictured outside the @entity167 with his new wife @entity168 , has denied taking part in a @entity11 conversion ceremony - but apparently not denied being a @entity11			1

@entity0 denies taking part in the ceremony - but does n't deny being a @entity11
he says article written by @entity3 is littered with ' schoolgirl howlers '
*politician* has always been referred to as @entity61
interview carried out as mr @entity0 ate a halal meal
