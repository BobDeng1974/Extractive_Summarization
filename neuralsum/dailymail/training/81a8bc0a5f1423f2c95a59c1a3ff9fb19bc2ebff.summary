the fantastical shots , which appear on two posters promoting the 2014 @entity6 for @entity7 and @entity8 , see ms @entity1 , 28 , re-enact a utopian scene , in which she appears in two versions ; one as @entity12 and the other as @entity14 - both identical but for the genitalia , which are computer generated , leaving the question of whether she has male or female private parts in real life unanswered			1
' i 'm @entity12 , i 've eve , i 'm me ' , the caption reads , a celebration of inclusion ahead of the may 31 annual @entity6 in @entity26 , which is a the biggest charity event in @entity28 to support people with @entity7			2
blurred lines : transgender model @entity1 ( pictured as @entity14 , censored ) appears in photographer @entity0 's @entity32 inspired posters , which see her completely nude in a surreal , floral setting ' your gender should not matter in your heart or in the way you express your personality , ' she says of the posters			1
' there are so many types of diverse people on this planet			2
my message is : beauty has no gender			2
at the end of the day beauty is beauty			2
' the poster was inspired by this year 's @entity6 motto , ' @entity50 ' and borrows from 15th century artist @entity54 's most iconic work of the same name ; a chaotic tangle of nude bodies and scenes of @entity59			1
double vision : the twin posters , which promote the 2014 @entity6 , an annual @entity8 event , show ms @entity1 as @entity14 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) , both are identical but for the computer generated genitalia inspiration : the whimsical photo artwork will be auctioned off for charity , and borrows from 15th century artist @entity54 's painting ' @entity50 ' ( pictured ) - which is this year 's @entity6 motto mr @entity0 , 51 , went with a whimsical scene , his @entity32 landscape punctured with foliage and phallic symbolism - ms @entity1 posing with her long golden locks falling over her bare shoulders , her breasts exposed in both the @entity12 and the eve portraits , and gazing at the nude male body before her , whose head is encased in an eerie sphere			1
' for me the body is more than something to be looked at as an object of sexual gratification , ' explains mr @entity0 , discussing his blurring of gender lines			0
' the body is a beautiful housing for the soul that we are celebrating in this picture			0
' stunner : ms @entity1 , seen in february at @entity94 , has made quite the name for herself as a successful transgender model , and says her message is that ' beauty has no gender ' and it 's a beautiful body indeed			1
ms @entity1 first shot to fame on the 2010 season of @entity104 's @entity103 but was eliminated halfway through the season , later to be snapped up by @entity106			1

the body is a beautiful housing for the soul that we are celebrating in this picture ' in a 2012 @entity123 post , she wrote : ' i live my life as a female but i have not gotten my gender reassignment surgery			1
to be honest , i 'm still thinking about that part			0
me and my husband want to be able to have kids one day and once i get the surgery , i will not be able to produce @entity132 to create an offspring with a genetic females @entity132			2
[ sic ] ' she has since separated from long - term partner @entity136			0
change : ms @entity1 originally shot to fame as a man in 2010 when she appeared in @entity104 's @entity103 , before being snapped up by @entity106 and having surgery to become a woman in 2012 mystery : she has remained tight - lipped as to whether she has had the full gender re-assignment surgery on her genitalia , but admitted in 2012 that she was torn because she wanted the chance to have children ms @entity1 is now keen to work on breaking down the barriers between the ' normal ' modelling industry and that of transgender modelling			1
speaking about models such as @entity151 and @entity152 , she said : ' i want to be like those girls			0
' i do n't want to just be labelled as a transgender model			2
why do i have to be separated ? it 's the modelling industry - one industry			0

mr @entity0 's two photograph artworks will be auctioned at the @entity177 2014 in @entity26 , just ahead of the @entity6			0
' @entity0 ’s picture does not deal with sexuality as one might think at first glance , it ’s about identity and expresses that human dignity and tolerance have no limits , ' says @entity6 , founder of @entity6			0
' we are very honored to be able to transport one of @entity6 ’s central issues with these outstanding pictures			0

her genitalia is computer generated in the images , and it remains *unclear* whether the model has male or female private parts in real life
