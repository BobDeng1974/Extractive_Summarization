a study led by professor @entity9 at the @entity10 says a diet rich in @entity12 could be the key to beating the disease because it makes it more treatable			2
the researchers have discovered that retenoic acid , a chemical made from @entity12 , can reduce the ability of the cancer to invade surrounding tissue			1
@entity12 can be found in foods such as carrots , sweet potatoes and leafy green vegetables such as kale			2
prof @entity9 said : ' if the cancer is confined to the prostate it ’s much more treatable with conventional medicine			0
this is about prevention rather than cure but it can stop the spread of cancer			2
' we have found that specific twin genes are turned off in malignant prostate cancer stem cells			0
when we turn them back on using retenoic acid , the cancer becomes less aggressive			0
' it has been known for many years that low vitamin a in samples of men ’s blood is associated with prostate cancer , but nobody knew the mechanisms involved			0
' this is an exciting new development which links an element from our diet to prostate cancer stem cells			1
' each year 41,000 men in the @entity55 are diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 10,000 die of the disease			0
carrots contain @entity12 , which scientists believe could make the disease more treatable			1
