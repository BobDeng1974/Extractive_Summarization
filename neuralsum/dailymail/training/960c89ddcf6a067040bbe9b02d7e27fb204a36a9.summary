@entity0 play their first @entity2 warm - up friendly on friday against @entity3 , a team famous for the sash in their kit , here @entity7 have ranked the best ten kits with a sash			1
it is not uncommon for teams to introduce brand new kits ahead of big tournaments or in tournament years and despite not being in the @entity2 @entity3 have released a new home and away kit			1
the home kit is a classic representation of their white shirt with red sash whilst the new away kit is an interesting red kit with red sash			2
new : @entity3 unveil their new home and away kits for this year 10			1
@entity27 1887 - 8 home a far cry from their claret kit of today , @entity27 started with a white and blue combo when they were formed in the late 1800s			2
this edition sees white shorts with a singular dark blue sash going across the chest			2
different : one of @entity27 's earliest kits does n't look much like what they currently turn out in 9			2
@entity39 1885 - 89 home and 2010 - 11 home sometimes it is best to go back to your roots and in the 2010 - 11 season @entity39 did exactly that			0
the club were celebrating their 125th anniversary and decided to go back to the first kit the club had ever worn			1
simple and effective , it is a shame it is n't in use now			0
spot the difference : @entity39 's kit from 1885 ( left ) and @entity55 ( right ) wearing the 2010 - 11 version 8			1
@entity57 2013 - 14 away a late entry into the contest , @entity57 ditched their traditional stripes this season and opted for a sash on both kits			0
the home kit is unchanged otherwise but this white and gold number looks very sophisticated			0
regal : @entity66 ( second right ) of @entity57 sporting their kit for the 2013 - 14 season 7			0
@entity70 1993 -- 94 away this kit coincided with @entity73 's first season at @entity70 and the club winning the @entity75 but that is n't why it was selected			1
this kit emboldens the famous black and blue of @entity70 in one sash without looking too big and looks impressive			0
@entity81 : @entity84 sporting @entity70 's away kit in the season they won the @entity75 6			1
@entity86 2009 home one of the most recognisable kits in the world , @entity89 's white with red sash is one kit that nearly every football fan would be able to identify			1
the @entity97 giants ' kit is so similar year on year that it is difficult to pick one out			0
we 've gone for the 2009 home kit which embodies everything that is great about this particular shirt			0
famous : the @entity86 team in 2009 , sporting their famous white strip with red sash 5			0
@entity3 2014 home and away the cause of this piece finding itself at number five is simple			1
the home kit is truly excellent , capturing the white with red sash perfectly however the away kit is a little more of a problem and that is the reason this kit is n't higher			0
surely the logical thing here would have been to have had a red kit with a white sash ? @entity121 on red just does n't look right			0
good and bad : the @entity3 home kit ( left ) is let down by the away kit ( right ) 4			1
@entity126 @entity125 away the traditional yellow is in the sash and we think that it works really well against the darker section of the kit			0
international kits have the advantage of no sponsorship and if this had been a club kit there is no doubt it would n't have been anywhere near as good			1
dynamic : @entity126 's @entity139 sports @entity126 's away kit in @entity125 against @entity141 3			1
@entity142 1980 - 83 home few clubs embrace the sash quite like @entity142 , throughout the club 's history there are some excellent examples and narrowing them down was tricky			1
this effort from the early 1980s is one of their finest and although it may not have been a successful period for the club , the kit was of the highest quality			1
simple : @entity158 of @entity142 in action for his team in 1980 2			0
@entity142 2013 - 14 away this kit is very unlucky not to be at the top of this list but it remains a fantastic shirt			1
@entity142 are famous for their red and blue but on the black the colours seem enhanced			0
@entity142 's support gained plenty of plaudits this season , their kit also deserves a lot of recognition			2
sleek : @entity177 in action in @entity142 's black away kit 1			2
@entity181 @entity2 2014 away @entity181 's football team have shot to world fame in the past couple of years with a talented young squad and a number of @entity188 players in their first team			0
however their kits for the @entity2 are also worth talking about , with the black away kit in particular standing out			0
the winner : @entity181 's black kit for the @entity195 is one of the best kits around at the moment			2

@entity3 's new kit with sashes will be worn against @entity0
