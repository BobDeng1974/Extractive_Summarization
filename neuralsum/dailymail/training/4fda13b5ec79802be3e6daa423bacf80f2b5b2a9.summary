by @entity0 last updated at 10:05 am on 3rd february 2012 a restaurant owned by @entity3 's parents has been panned by a top critic who branded the food ' unspeakably fatty ' and the waiters ' clueless '			1
@entity9 eatery ' @entity7 ' was savaged by the @entity11 's @entity10 for serving up ' calamari like leather ' and ' shellfish pasta similar to airplane food '			1

' you do n't expect a brand - new eatery to be running on all cylinders , ' he wrote			1
' but @entity7 , owned by the pop superstar 's parents , last night was running mainly on acrid - smelling burnt vinegar wafting intermittently through the raucous dining room			1
' @entity10 complained about the the ' unspeakably fatty veal osso bucco , ' which he said was overpriced at $ 38 ( Â£ 24 ) , and he criticised the appetizers that took 50 minutes to arrive			1
despite boasting the highly rated tv chef @entity55 as it food chief , the @entity54 tabloid goes on to describe the service as ' plucked from the ' burbs ' and ' clueless '			1
the 25 - year old singer 's parents @entity27 and @entity61 will be hoping the review does n't have a negative effect on bookings			1
named after @entity3 's aunt , @entity7 , who died of lupus aged 19 , the @entity65 winning pop star has often said the late painter was an inspiration to her			2
with traditional @entity30 home - style wooden furnishings which the @entity11 found to be ' plain cramped ' and ' loud as an avalanche ' , the restaurant is a far cry from @entity3 's crazy style			2

the family are unlikely to be pleased by the review and during last nights ill fated service it seemed that @entity3 's father @entity27 himself was walking around the front of house			2
this is the first time that he and his wife have dabbled in the restaurant business and @entity27 , a former internet entrepreneur , is excited by the prospect			2

' everything from the menu to the decor has a bit of their family in it			0
it 's why everything is so warm and approachable			0
' the decor inside the establishment is the complete polar opposite to the singer 's eccentric style			0
the eatery features wooden tables , leather booths , open brick walls , and warm - coloured painted walls			0
