the blobfish , described as ' hideous ' by @entity8 from the @entity9 , is a jelly - like fish that resembles a bald , grumpy old man			1
measuring up to a foot in length , it lives between 600 and 1,200 metres below the ocean surface off the coasts of @entity17 and @entity18			1
it lives between 600 and 1,200 metres below the ocean surface off the coasts of @entity17 and @entity18 despite being completely inedible , it has a habit of being hauled up in trawler nets			1
experts believe the blobfish is under serious threat , although there are no reliable estimates of its numbers			1
' we 've needed an ugly face for endangered animals for a long time , ' said mr @entity8 , speaking at the @entity35 at the @entity36			2
the @entity37 , a freaky cross between @entity39 and the @entity40 , is endangered because of urbanisation in @entity42 and polluted waters ' for too long the cute and fluffy animals have taken the limelight but now the blobfish will be a voice for the mingers who always get forgotten			1
' the blobfish topped a shortlist of five ugly animals voted for online by members of the public			1
in second place was the @entity56 , a critically endangered giant parrot from @entity58 , and number three was the @entity37 , a weird type of salamander from @entity42 that is the equivalent of a giant tadpole			2
next on the list was the @entity65 water frog , aka the ' scrotum frog ' , which is only found in @entity65 on the border of @entity68 and @entity69			1

the last ugly animal is the proboscis monkey , from @entity91 , whose enormous nose is literally its hooter			1
the nose provides a resonating echo chamber for the monkey 's deafening mating calls			1
the @entity9 was set up to champion the cause of endangered creatures with no friends			1
it is backed by a number of celebrity scientists , presenters and comedians , and organises road shows and school visits			2
particle physicist and broadcaster professor @entity109 said : ' i support the ugly animal campaign			2
there are too many people trying to save cute animals			2
they get all the press , and all the attention			2
' ugly animals are more deserving than cute animals			0
' describing the blobfish , mr @entity8 said : ' indeed this is an ugly hideous thing			1
it looks sad and so it should , because it 's suffering from severe problems			0
' they 've got a really gelatinous flesh that is slightly more buoyant than the water			0
so they float around and they can be right lazy			0
' they 've got no muscle tone whatsoever because they do n't have to move			0
they just sit there looking unhappy , grabbing any food that comes by			0

@entity175 ( comedian and actor ) thinks the slug deserves far more recognition than it currently gets ... ' it 's a slug , with a hump on its back , that can jump ! where 's its @entity183 movie ? ? you 've got the @entity185 ... where 's the dromedary jumping slug and the princess ?

the greater short - horned lizard is identified by its toad - like appearance			2
when scared , it builds its blood pressure near its eyes , and forces blood through its tear ducts , squirting it at predators			0
combined with a noxious smell , the blood is a surprisingly effective method of repelling predators such as foxes , coyotes and dogs			0

the most unique feature is the elongated , pig - like snout , which acts like a snorkel , allowing the turtle to breathe while the rest of the body remains underwater ( perhaps so it never has to show the world its ugly face ? )			2
@entity227 ( daredevil scientist and @entity230 's ' resident scientist ' ) says : ' forget your big cuddly attention grabbing pandas			0
it 's time for something else to step up into the limelight , well , i guess something to swim up in this case ! yes , it is the pig - nosed turtle ... so there you go - the pig - nosed turtle			1

@entity265 ( producer , presenter and from @entity268 ) explains why he has sympathy for these particularly unattractive beasts ...

seventeen of these are currently known to be breeding , the eighteenth is actually just one lone male who appears to have come over from the continent and lives in a cave in @entity295 on his own			2
bats make up over a quarter of the mammal species that live in the @entity282 and can often be found near railway lines , as they like to use the tunnels as roosting areas , and short cuts to other hunting grounds			0
@entity8 sympathises with these species : ' bats are brilliant , if you can not see all the reasons @entity282 bats are fantastic , you must be as blind as a , well , as a bat actually !
