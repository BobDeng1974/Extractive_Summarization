@entity1 boss @entity0 is not looking to sign a replacement for @entity3 during the january transfer window			1
the veteran striker 's move to @entity7 was confirmed on tuesday and @entity0 sees @entity8 , who is fit again after a long - term knee injury , as the player to step into the breach			1
@entity1 are enduring a difficult season and have failed to win any of their last eight games , but @entity0 is in no hurry to bring in reinforcements			1
@entity8 can fill the striker 's void at @entity1 after recovering from long - term injury @entity0 is wary of trying to find a replacement for @entity3 in the january transfer window the @entity22 legend holds aloft a scarf after completing his move to serie a side @entity7 he told the club 's official website : ' january is not the place to find solutions ( in the transfer market )			1
our moment of form , we want to change , but the solutions are in the squad			0
' with @entity8 being fully fit , i see him as a replacement for @entity3 's position and it is more about trying to get the players back from injury			1
' @entity40 and @entity41 have been two players missing throughout the season , which has been disappointing because they are important in the way we want to play			0
@entity48 ' o stands with his hands on his hips during his first training session with @entity7 @entity40 ( left ) and @entity41 are back in contention after returning to full fitness ' @entity41 played in every single game last season and we miss what he brings			2
so i am looking around that			0
' we are always working and if we can do something to help the players we have got at the club then we will do something			0
but what 's clear is that january is not very straightforward			2
' you never get value for money , first and foremost , and you will not get players you have been following for a long time			0
and if you want to rely on january to find solutions for your season , then it is a big gamble			0
