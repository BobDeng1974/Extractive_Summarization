by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 neatly summed up the challenge of @entity4 after a rollercoaster third round in the @entity6			1
@entity1 made the halfway cut with just a shot to spare after rounds of 70 and 73 , but in a packed field was just seven off the overnight lead shared by fellow @entity13 @entity12 , @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity17 's @entity16			1
early leader : @entity12 is currently topping the @entity6 leaderboard concentration : @entity12 focuses on the ball during the third round of the @entity6 when he raced to the turn in 31 with five birdies in eight holes the @entity24 - based 31 - year - old was just two off the pace , but a back nine of 39 meant he had to settle for a 70 and level - par total of 213			1
' it was a tale of two nines , ' said @entity1 , who claimed his third @entity33 title in the @entity34 last year , a closing 63 holding off the challenge of @entity36			2
' i finally took advantage of the front nine with the best golf i have played in a long time , but the back nine is very , very hard			2
i made one bad swing and picked one bad club and it cost me four shots			0
' even if i had shot one over and got in at three or four under i would be in a good position to try and win the tournament tomorrow			0
' @entity36 had taken 40 shots to cover the back nine in his second round of 78 and with the wind blowing in the same direction , @entity1 added : ' i 'm not going to be the only one			2
everyone is making birdies on the front nine and struggling on the back			0
' half of the tee times had been delayed by 20 minutes due to mist rolling in from the @entity59 , meaning overnight leaders @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity12 were just beginning their third rounds			1
the trio had been joined at the top of the leaderboard when @entity15 's @entity65 also went to the turn in 31 , but the former @entity68 number one then ran up a double - bogey six on the 13th			0
playing partner @entity36 , whose run of poor friday performances after excellent opening rounds continues to be a mystery , had recovered from a three - putt bogey on the first with four birdies to lie just three off the lead on three under			0
and defending champion @entity78 was also three under after following a bogey on the fourth with a birdie on the next and eagle on the par - five sixth			0
tee off : @entity36 on the fourth hole during the @entity83 heavy mist : @entity1 believes he has regained his best form despite having to play in tricky conditions			1

@entity12 tops @entity6 leaderboard *ahead* of @entity14
@entity1 believes he is playing his ' best golf in a long time '
heavy mist from @entity59 delays proceedings at @entity6
