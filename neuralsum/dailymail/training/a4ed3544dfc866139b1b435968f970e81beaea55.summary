by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 16 january 2013 this baby red deer appears to be in the middle of an identity crisis , as he has convinced himself he is a lamb and has joined a flock of sheep			1
@entity7 was shocked when he was counting his animals and noticed the male fawn had joined his 100 livestock on @entity11 in @entity12			1
mr @entity7 , who looks after the sheep which help maintain the @entity14 land by grazing on it , said the lost deer became separated from its herd and attached itself to the flock			1
the sheep do not seem to mind their new guest and have adopted him into the flock , giving him a warm welcome			2
' i was counting the sheep when i spotted this little deer amongst the flock , ' said mr @entity7			1
' i think what 's happened is that the main herd of deer have come through the field , jumped over the fence and then jumped out again and he 's not gone with them			2
' he seems to have adopted the flock and stayed with them and the flock have taken to him really well			2
' there 's a bit of a pecking order in the flock so he 's finding his place within it			0
he sees to be the bottom of the ladder			0
' he does seem to miss the sheep if he 's too far away from them and does go looking for them			0
' cunfused : @entity7 says that the deer seems convinced he is a lamb after a fortnight with them bonding : the deer has spent two weeks eating , drinking and sleeping with the 100 sheep is fully integrated sad : when the sheep move on to new pastures later this year , sadly the deer will be left behind @entity14 had only recently moved the 100 sheep north from @entity78 , where the fields become flooded with shallow water in the winter and so are too wet for the sheep to graze			1
the deer now spends his day grazing with the sheep and does not seem to have noticed his lack of woolly coat or inability to bleat			0
he even sleeps in the field with the flock at night			0
' i 've never known of this happening before , ' added mr @entity7			0
' the big deer spend a lot of time in the field when the sheep are away in the summer and two winters ago we had a yearling in the field for two days but that did not hang around with the sheep			0
' surprise ! ' i was counting the sheep when i spotted this little deer amongst the flock , ' said shepherd mr @entity7 but sadly the young animal will not be able to stay a ' sheep deer ' forever			1
at the end of the winter the sheep will be taken back to their summer home , but the deer will have to stay behind on @entity11			0
a spokesman for the @entity14 added : ' it is hoped the young deer will rejoin his herd if they roam past the flock over the coming weeks			1

the confused deer has joined a flock on @entity14 land in @entity12
a shepherd came to tend his livestock and found the male fawn among them
it has been with them for two weeks and has been accepted by the group
