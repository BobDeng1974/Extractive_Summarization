it has long been an integral part of school chemistry lessons - and a revision nightmare for students the world over			2
now there is one more element to add to the periodic table - and a ' super-heavy ' one at that			1
scientists in @entity11 have confirmed the existence of a new chemical element , but its name may need some work			2
the ' super-heavy ' man - made element has been temporarily named ' ununpentium ' and refers to the element 's 115th place in the periodic table			1
scientists in @entity11 have confirmed the existence of a new chemical element			0
the ' super-heavy ' man - made element has been temporarily named ' ununpentium ' and refers to its 115th place in the periodic table @entity23 will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally approved by experts from the @entity27 and @entity28			1
it presently has an atomic symbol of @entity23 and is approximately 289 times heavier than hydrogen , which is the lightest element			2
researchers at @entity33 in @entity11 lead the research and said their find backs up claims by teams in @entity38 and the @entity39 a decade ago that had remained unverified until now			0
the @entity11 scientists say they conducted experiments which allowed them to detect the ` fingerprint ' of the short - lived but heavy element			2
the experiment was conducted at the @entity46 research facility in @entity47			0
' this was a very successful experiment and is one of the most important in the field in recent years ' , said @entity52 , professor at the @entity53 at @entity33			0
@entity23 will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally approved by experts from the @entity27 and @entity28			1
it presently has an atomic symbol of @entity23 and is approximately 289 times heavier than hydrogen - the lightest element besides the observations of the new chemical element , the researchers have also gained access to data that gives them a deeper insight into the structure and properties of super-heavy atomic nuclei			1
by bombarding a thin film of americium with calcium ions , the research team was able to measure photons in connection with the new element ’s alpha decay			0
certain energies of the photons agreed with the expected energies for x-ray radiation , which is a ‘ fingerprint ’ of a given element			0
some people have claimed ununpentium is used by @entity83 as a component in gravity wave generators , @entity86 reported			0
the new element also makes an appearance in computer games including @entity90 and @entity91 , where it is an energy source for weapons and teleporters			1
however , due to its unstable nature , its uses in the real world are likely to be few and far between			0
@entity99 , which has the atomic number of 116 , is the most recent element to be approved and win a spot on the periodic table in may 2012 .			1

' @entity23 ' is a heavy man - made element and is currently 115th in the periodic table
the element will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally approved by experts
@entity23 makes an appearance in computer games including @entity91 and is *thought* to be used by *aliens* , according to *believers*
