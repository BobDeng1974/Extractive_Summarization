by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 05:40 est , 6 january 2014 jailed : @entity3 from @entity4 , @entity2 has been sentenced to two years and eight months a young mother who left her boyfriend fighting for his life after she stabbed him for not calling her while on a night out has been jailed			1
@entity3 , 21 , punched bricklayer @entity8 , 23 , then knifed him in the shoulder when he returned from a night out with friends			1
she then casually lit up a cigarette while standing over his blood - soaked body			2
despite the wound , which severed a major artery and caused significant blood loss , mr @entity8 survived - but has suffered memory loss and has nightmares of being stabbed again			1
@entity3 who had a reprimand and a caution for battery on her criminal record admitted wounding and was jailed for two years and eight months			1
sentencing , @entity23 told @entity3 : ' you sometimes deliberately set out to be confrontational with him			1
' throughout all of this , mr @entity8 never used violence against you , which in the circumstances was extraordinarily restrained , given the provocation			1
' i am satisfied you were well aware you had caused him serious injury			2
' rather than offer him help or call an ambulance , you lit and smoked a cigarette			2
it ’s clear @entity8 was close to death and only the skill of the medical team which operated on him saved his life			1
' ' he continues to suffer physical and psychological effects from what you did and is likely to do so for some considerable time			2
' @entity4 @entity43 was told the couple had been in a relationship for a year and initially were ' happy and healthy ' yet a ' darker , more sinister side ' of @entity3 's character emerged			1
@entity3 had on two previous occasions turned on him with a knife with mr @entity8 having to wrestle it off her			1
mr @entity8 lied at work about a black eye @entity3 had given him , but never thought she was capable of using a knife and would often leave the house to let her cool down			1
she had also smashed doors and furniture during heated arguments and had revealed she had been advised to attend anger management courses			2
happier times : @entity8 with partner @entity3 , who stabbed him with a knife after he failed to call her every two hours while on a night out @entity64 , prosecuting , added : ' she revealed a different side of her character , a volatile side , an aggressive side , an unpredictable side where she would lose her temper and damage the property and furniture , doors , in a fit of rage			1
' no sooner would she blow up she would calm down			2
in flashes of temper the knife would come out and then matters would calm down - mr @entity8 had little realisation what lay ahead			1
' mr @entity8 saw the previous threats as empty and never thought she was capable of using a knife			1
he would often leave the house to let her cool down			0
miss @entity87 added : ' it is quite apparent that she was very keen to know exactly what he was up to that evening			0
she had run out of credit on her own mobile phone and so she kept his so that they could continue contact throughout the evening			0
violent : @entity3 and her partner had been happy in their relationship , but a ' darker side ' of the young mother emerged ' he telephoned her and spoke to her before he went to the party , not causing any difficulty at that stage			1
he made the error of not keeping in contact with the defendant			0
' the court heard mr @entity8 arrived at @entity3 's home in @entity4 after the function and she was said to be ' not best pleased '			1
she was so annoyed she punched him in the face fracturing his nose and leaving him with a black eye			1
she then went to the pub and continued drinking at a friend 's house before returning home at around 3am			0
on arriving back she taunted mr @entity8 , telling him that she had been with another man			1
he got up and dressed before making an attempt to leave			0
but as he did so @entity3 took the kitchen knife and attacked him in a ' fit of rage , or jealousy , or control , ' added miss @entity87			1
mr @entity8 staggered into the backyard where he was found in the backyard with a blood soaked shirt			1
police arrested @entity3 but she initially claimed her boyfriend had come home injured , before suggesting there must have been an intruder at the house			1
she also refused ' point blank ' to tell officers mr @entity8 's name , instead giving a false , foreign name despite police needing to call a next of kin			1
she then claimed she had n't realised how serious his injuries were and only sought help when she looked out of a back window and saw him turning grey and eyes rolling			2
miss @entity87 said : ' she claims that she was unaware that he had a serious injury and thought about turning the lights off and going to bed			2
she told the police she had a cigarette and she mopped up the blood in the kitchen			0
' ' the defendant did later accept that when she got back she was still annoyed and cross that he had left her alone whilst he was enjoying himself			0
' she accepts that she had gone upstairs to the bedroom where he was sleeping and taunted him and tried to get a reaction out of him claiming she had just been with another man			0
' there was a row in which she claims she was pinned down on the bed by him by her wrists , because he was angry and shouted			0
she accepted he did n't hit or hurt her			0
' in a videotaped interview mr @entity8 said : ' i went to the engagement do with all my mates and i forgot to ring her			1
i remember just coming round in hospital			0
i think my brain shut down			0
' previous : @entity3 had threatened mr @entity8 - who is now living back with his parents - with a knife twice before he said of the relationship : ' it was good up until eight months			1
she just started going loopy like screaming and shouting all the time and throwing stuff about in the house , breaking stuff then i would have to fix it			0
' we 'd argue when rough , after we 'd been out , then it started happening when we were out and then it was getting worse and worse , we 'd argue about little things			0
' she would throw anything , like a plate , i thought ' what a nutcase ' but she always calmed down			2
we would be arguing and she would go to hit me , she thought i had been looking at her mates if we were out			2
if i could n't calm her down i used to go for a walk			0
victim : @entity8 told the court : ' she just started going loopy like screaming and shouting all the time and throwing stuff about in the house ' ' she picked up a knife before but i never felt threatened			1
i thought she might have slashed me , i never took much notice because i never felt threatened			2
' she got a knife and started waving it around , i said ' what are you doing ' , she started pointing it about			2
i was a bit paranoid			0
this is when it was getting ropey and i was thinking ' this is n't going to work '			0
' he said he had repaired the bedroom door four times after she broke it by kicking and pushing it through			0
he said : ' every time we had an argument she would do that so i would have to repair it			0
i just think she needs to sort her anger problems out			0
she used to say people told her to go for anger management , she never really went into it			0
' ' i have the odd nightmare about being stabbed , not by her , by other people , someone comes and sits on me and stabs me in the chest			2
i 've had it more than once , it makes me wake up			0
i just try and block it out			0
' mr @entity8 is now said to be back living with his parents			1
@entity3 was cleared of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm			1
in mitigation her lawyer @entity236 said she was ' truly remorseful ' and extremely ashamed of what she had done			0
she had been in abusive relationships before the relationship with mr @entity8 but he had not given her any trouble			1
the barrister continued : ' it may be that became a mechanism she got used to and got used to responding to that by picking up a knife			2
' ' she did n’t realise he was so badly injured and did not callously sit there waiting for him to expire or sustain serious , long - standing injury			0
she regrets this may have put his life at risk			0
she was n’t thinking straight at the time			0
' after the case @entity256 @entity255 from @entity257 said : ' this attack was unprovoked and it was only the skill and expertise of paramedics and medical staff that saved the victim ’s life			1
' the physical and psychological effects of the attack will remain with him but i hope that this sentence gives him some closure as he wishes to now move forward with his life			2
' comparisons have been made between the case and a @entity275 storyline featuring @entity276 .			0
