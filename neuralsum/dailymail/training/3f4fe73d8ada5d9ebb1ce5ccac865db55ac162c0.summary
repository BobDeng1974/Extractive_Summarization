lesbian and gay couples were married in @entity1 on monday by the same judge who said she saw no reason why they could n't immediately get their licenses ahead of @entity7 's coming - out party as the nation 's 36th state where same - sex marriages are legal statewide			1
the addition of @entity7 's 19.9 million people means 70 percent of @entity14 now live in states where gay marriage is legal			1
it also reflects how much the nation 's third - largest state has changed since the days of @entity20 , the former beauty pageant queen and orange juice spokeswoman who started her national campaign against gay rights in @entity1 in the 1970s			1
the courtroom erupted in cheers when @entity38 circuit judge @entity34 cleared the way for the licenses issued to @entity69 and @entity32 , and @entity71 and @entity70			2
then she presided over their weddings in a dual ceremony			0
the first same - sex marriage license officially issued in @entity7 went to another pair of women -- @entity78 and @entity79 -- who attended the hearing , and later discovered they were first in line at the clerk 's desk			1
' we 're just happy for everyone here , ' said @entity79 , who plans a low - key wedding on tuesday			2
@entity78 , 66 , left , hugs her partner @entity79 , 60 , as they wait to apply for a marriage license at the @entity38 @entity92 office couples , left to right ; @entity69 with @entity32 , @entity94 , and @entity95 and @entity96 , celebrate as circuit judge @entity34 lifts a stay on her july ruling that @entity7 's same - sex marriage ban violates equal protections under the @entity102 other same - sex marriages were expected to happen around the state after midnight tuesday , when @entity14 district judge @entity104 's ruling , covering all 67 counties , was set to take effect			1
both judges found that the same - sex wedding ban in @entity7 's constitution violates the guarantees of equal treatment and due process enshrined in the 14th amendment to the @entity102			1
large - scale ceremonies in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 were planned for tuesday			0
others planned to take their time			0
' we want to do it right , ' said @entity60 , who is 48 , and is planning a march 2016 wedding with his 55 - year - old partner , @entity126			0
' we do n't want to rush to get it done			0
we 're planning it just like any normal couple would			0
' but while the news was largely met with cheers or even shrugs from @entity7 's more liberal enclaves such as @entity7 and @entity133 , signs of opposition to the rulings were evident farther north , where more conservative @entity138 live			1
in @entity141 , @entity140 clerk @entity139 shut down the courthouse chapel , saying no marriage ceremonies -- either gay or straight -- would be allowed there			2
at least two other counties in northeast @entity7 did the same			2
@entity145 , 53 , left , touches the face of his partner of 15 years @entity148 , 46 , right , as they wait to apply for a marriage license ' mr. @entity139 said some of his people felt a little uncomfortable doing it , ' said @entity154 , a spokesman for the clerk			2
' it could cause discriminations down there ( in the marriage license department ) with those who are uncomfortable			0
we wanted to eliminate any unfairness			0
' @entity7 's northern counties may see an influx of license applications by same - sex couples from other southern states where marriage bans remain in place			1
@entity170 , a spokesman for the state clerks ' association , said he was unaware of any clerk that did n't plan to issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples seeking them , although several have said they wo n't do any more weddings for anyone			1
' that 's not a statutory duty of theirs , ' said @entity170 , referring to the ceremonies			0
' the clerks are going to do what their duty is			0
' @entity7 's constitution was amended to ban same - sex marriages in 2008 by voters who approved it by a 60 percent margin			1
but judges in @entity7 found it discriminatory , mirroring decisions in many other states			1
and even as gays and lesbians get marriage licenses , @entity7 attorney general @entity194 has appeals pending in state and federal courts , seeking to uphold the state 's ban			1
@entity194 's position — one shared by former @entity7 gov. @entity204 , now considering a run for president — is that marriage should be defined by each state			1
opponents of same - sex marriage in @entity7 were n't giving up without a fight			1
@entity212 , a conservative legal group based in the @entity117 area , planned to file complaints in several counties monday in an effort to block clerks from issuing licenses to same - sex couples , said the group 's lawyer , @entity220			1
the group already tried to block @entity224 's clerk in a complaint filed on behalf of @entity226 , but that advocacy group 's case was dismissed last week			0
a similar case is pending in @entity230			0
@entity220 still hopes for success in the courts , and said ' the fact that some clerks may issue licenses against the law does n't obviate any of the appeals			2
' the state 's first weddings were set to happen in the same county where , 38 years ago , @entity241 successfully campaigned to overturn a @entity38 ordinance banning discrimination against gays			2
the county commission reinstated those protections two decades later			0
@entity241 's career suffered — as did @entity7 orange juice sales — and she blamed the ' ultra-liberal press			1
' ' they 're saying i 'm a bigot and have hatred for the homosexuals , ' she told the @entity256 in 1977			0
' i do n't hate homosexuals			0
i love them enough to tell them the truth : that @entity261 puts them in the category with other sinners			0
' the state 's catholic bishops issued a joint statement monday expressing disappointment , saying implications of gay marriages are n't fully understood and will upend millennia of tradition			1
' how society understands marriage has great public significance , ' they said			0
' because of this , redefining civil ' marriage ' to include two persons of the same sex will have far - reaching consequences in society			2
such a change advances the notion that marriage is only about the effective gratification of consenting adults			0

lesbian and gay couples were married in @entity1 on monday
@entity293 said she saw no reason why they could n't immediately get their licenses ahead of @entity7 's coming - out party
@entity7 is the nation 's 36th state where same - sex marriages are legal statewide
the addition of @entity7 's 19.9 million people means 70 percent of @entity14 now live in states where gay marriage is legal
