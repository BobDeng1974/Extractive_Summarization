by @entity0 published : 08:58 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 20:56 est , 20 march 2013 when they moved into their purpose - built £ 50million offices , the council staff of @entity2 had high hopes for the lavatories			1
instead , the new facilities caused a revolt – because they are unisex			2
some workers at the new headquarters were aggrieved at the idea of men and women using the same cubicles			1
now , the gender ratio on each floor of the building will be analysed before individual toilets are allocated proportionately as either male or female			0
@entity20 : but @entity2 council 's new building is only equipped with unisex bathrooms , leading to staff anger it all adds up to the town ’s biggest toilet fiasco since its shopping mall introduced squat loos in the name of cultural sensitivity three years ago			1
the new offices , named @entity34 @entity33 , were built to accommodate 2,000 council staff			0
boss : @entity2 council 's new building was overseen by chief executive @entity38 however , the first batch of workers to transfer to the new building were shocked to find it lacked separate toilet facilities			1
@entity44 , @entity45 ’s @entity2 branch secretary , said council staff have raised concerns			1
‘ people do have different views on it but there are a number of people who are upset about the unisex issue , ’ she said			0
‘ i think what the council is looking at doing now is tallying up the ratio of male and female workers on each floor and will split up the toilets that way			2
’ each floor of the building has around eight toilet cubicles opening off a corridor , all currently with male and female symbols on the door			0
' they are fully enclosed with their own washing and drying facilities , rather than communal ones			0
nevertheless some staff have apparently baulked at the idea of using cubicles frequented by members of the opposite sex			2
last night @entity78 , chief executive of the @entity79 ’ @entity80 , said : ‘ it ’s bizarre that council bosses pressed ahead with unisex loos despite a clear lack of demand for them			0
‘ this is a perfect example of politically correct thinking trumping common sense at the expense of everyone else			0
’ unisex toilets first entered the public consciousness in the 1990s @entity94 tv series @entity95 where they were the setting for gossip and romantic encounters between her lawyer colleagues			0
as a compromise , cubicles at @entity2 council ’s building will now be allocated as male or female			1
operational services director @entity108 said : ‘ the building was intended to have unisex toilets on the office floors , as is the norm in many modern buildings			2
controversy : the building was only equipped with unisex toilets rather than men 's and women 's ‘ however , based on staff feedback who have been based in the building for several weeks and discussions with the unions , we ’ve decided to review these facilities			0
’ the building also houses the town ’s new library and has space for private firms			0
the council says it will save £ 1million a year by having workers in one modern location as well as giving a better service to local people			1
in 2010 there was amazement when @entity2 ’s @entity137 mall installed two squat toilets after bosses were told some of the town ’s @entity142 and @entity143 communities preferred them			1
@entity2 is far from the only council to have wasted taxpayers ' money on perks which turned out to be useless			1
last month , @entity150 council came under fire for spending £ 10,000 on a replica of the mayor 's ceremonial gold chain			0
eight months ago , @entity156 council in @entity157 paid £ 630 to translate its newsletter into @entity159 for the benefit of just one resident who complained about not understanding the promotional document			2
and in 2011 , workers at @entity165 council were treated to a day out at a high - wire adventure course , with taxpayers shouldering the £ 750 bill			1

*employees* have just started working at modern complex in @entity2
workers complained to union reps over mixed - sex bathrooms
