by @entity0 published : 03:32 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 03:32 est , 25 january 2013 family feud : @entity2 is attempting to claim part of his actor father 's film royalties sir @entity7 's son says he is ' close to bankruptcy ' after losing the latest round of a long - running court battle over his father 's estate			1
@entity2 claims the renowned actor intended to leave him the royalties to his work , and is fighting to claim the money from sir @entity7 's third wife			1
but yesterday a high court judge ruled that there was not enough evidence to launch a case in the @entity24 , and said she was ' appalled ' at the money wasted on the family feud			1
the 56 - year - old sculptor faces a bill of £ 114,000 in legal costs after his bid to get his hands on his father 's riches failed			1
mr @entity2 , the actor 's son by his second wife , has been fighting his stepmother @entity37 in the @entity39 courts since sir @entity7 's death in 2004 , arguing that a will he wrote in 1968 should be honoured			1
although that case is still ongoing , he launched a parallel action in @entity24 aiming to capture the rights to the actor 's intellectual property and royalties			1
his lawyer @entity47 argued in court that ' overarching ' lifetime trusts set up by sir @entity7 had put the rights to his work out of reach of his widow , leaving his assets in the hands of his children			1
the whereabouts of those rights and royalties - which were said to have been put into an offshore structure by sir @entity7 decades before his death - have not been confirmed			2
the barrister argued that mr @entity2 's research indicated that two @entity39 lawyers control the alleged trusts - something which they vigorously deny			2
mr @entity47 asked the judge to transfer the part of the legal row concerning the trusts to the jurisdiction of the @entity73 courts			2
inheritance : sir @entity7 died near his home in @entity39 in 2004 , aged 82 mrs @entity76 accepted that sir @entity7 had set up ' tax efficient structures under which he could receive royalties for his creative endeavours , namely writing and acting '			0
but she said that there was ' no evidence of any actual trust ' , ruling that mr @entity2 was unable to prove that his father 's money was intended from him			1
' mr von @entity2 ca n't say who are its beneficiaries and what are its terms , ' she said			2
' his claim is the most fragile claim imaginable			1
nor is there any evidence of any trust governed by @entity73 law			2
' the judge suggested that the sculptor 's intention was to use the legal process to obtain documents which could prove his claim			1
she concluded that to hear part of the case in the @entity24 would lead to ' risks of inconsistent findings and irreconcilable judgements '			0
highlight : sir @entity7 in @entity105 , one of the biggest hits of his glittering decades - long career speaking outside court , mr @entity2 said that the costs of the long - running case had exhausted his funds , and insisted that his father intended him to receive his inheritance			1
' i was very close to my father - when he died i was holding his hand and i felt like he had asked me to put some order into his affairs , but it has been very hard , ' he said			2
' now i 'm close to bankruptcy and i do n't know what to do			0
nine years i 've been fighting and i did n't inherit a penny yet			0
' he added : ' this action was not really against my stepmother or my sisters , it was about the fact that my father saved up money and rights for years and now they are not available to the family			0
' these trusts contained the rights and royalties to everything he wrote , his film rights and everything			0
it 's a very sad story because the family have no way of getting hands on them			0
' relatives : sir @entity7 's daughter @entity145 , left , and her husband @entity146 , right , lamented the cost of the case his half - sister @entity145 said : ' it 's one of those funny situations which arise in families sometimes			0
i ca n't begin to imagine what it has cost			0
' her husband @entity156 added : ' @entity7 was a wonderful man and i loved him very much as a son - in - law , but being successful at such a high level as he was , everybody wanted a piece of him			0
' i would be surprised if there is anything left in the estate - it has probably all gone to the lawyers			0
' sir @entity7 , a double @entity166 winner , was born in @entity73 but moved to @entity39 in 1960 and lived there until his death .			0
