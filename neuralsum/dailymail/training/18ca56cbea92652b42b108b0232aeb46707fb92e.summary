the beast is thought to have weighed up to six tons and was sold to a private buyer £ 150,000 ( $ 236,000 ) @entity8 was found after spending around 100,000 years under the ice in @entity13 , and was put up for auction by @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
the beast is thought to have weighed up to six tonnes			1
curator @entity22 said it was unusual for a nearly complete skeleton to come on the market for sale			0
the skeleton had been part of a private collection in @entity29 , but had not been assembled and mounted until it was prepared for auction			1

the inside curve of the tusks is approximately 8ft ( 2.4 metres ) and the specimen is thought to be a male @entity8 was expected to sell for up to for £ 250,000 ( $ 409,000 )			1
' imagine the mammoth covered in fur - long fur on top with a shorter undercoat - and although quite similar to today 's elephant , it had smaller ears and a shorter tail to minimise frostbite and heat loss , so it was well adapted for the ice age , ' said mr @entity22			2
' its habitat was the mammoth steppe , stretching across northern @entity59 and @entity60 , so its diet was mainly grass and sedges , which explains why it only had four molar teeth , and also stunning long , curved tusks			2
' the woolly mammoth is thought to be a male			1
@entity68 , of @entity15 , said : ' what 's exceptional about this one is it 's more or less complete with two magnificent tusks			2
there are one or two toes missing			0
the woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans , who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art. ' to the best of my knowledge , i do n't think there has been one sold at auction , certainly not in the @entity88 and i do n't think in @entity29 , so it 's a first in that respect , ' said auctioneer @entity68 back from the dead ? scientists hope to bring woolly mammoths back from extinction woolly mammoths could be brought back from extinction after a preserved body of one of the ancient animals was found frozen in the snowy wastes of @entity13 , scientists hope			2
the mammoth , which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago , is in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature			0
an autopsy of the @entity5 beast , which has been nicknamed @entity108 by scientists , will be shown in a documentary later this month			0
the @entity112 programme will also examine pioneering work on cloning the woolly mammoth , which is taking place in @entity116 and the @entity117			0
scientists hope that , eventually , they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild , tens of thousands of years after they became extinct			0
@entity122 , a @entity116 geneticist , told the @entity123 : ' bringing back the mammoth either through cloning or genetic engineering would be an extremely long process			2
we 're trying hard to make this possible within our generation			0
' that 's why we have to start discussing the implications now			0
some of our colleagues are still working on analysing the genome from @entity108 's specimen			0
this is a long and complicated process that is unlikely to be finished anytime in the near future			0
' ' it looks very impressive , the inside curve of the tusks is about 8ft ( 2.4 metres )			0
it 's bigger than an elephant			0
