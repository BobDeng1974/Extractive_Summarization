by @entity0 a grandmother has been awarded more than £ 20,000 in compensation after a botched tummy tuck operation caused her belly button to ‘ explode ’ on a plane			1
@entity6 , 68 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was flying home from a week ’s holiday in @entity11 when her belly button ‘ erupted ’			1
this caused foul smelling stomach contents to leak from her abdomen , causing other passengers to complain about the smell			1
@entity6 , 68 , had a botched tummy tuck after which her belly button ' exploded ' on a plane mrs @entity6 , the manager of a residential care home , decided to have a tummy tuck when she was 60 because she was unhappy with her appearance			1
she had lost weight but was self - conscious about the saggy skin and fat left on her stomach			2
as a result , she underwent surgery at a private hospital in 2005			2
during the operation , surgeons removed extra skin and fat as well as tightening the muscles in the abdominal wall			0
but , they did not create a new belly button for mrs @entity6 because she was told there was not enough material left over , which is a common occurrence in this type of surgery			1
however , they had left parts of the old one inside her			0
mrs @entity6 said : ‘ for the first year after the operation , everything was fine and i went to work as normal			2
‘ however , i was due for a yearly check - up and it was during this time that the surgeon was concerned about the scarring because it looked quite bad			0
during the operation mrs @entity6 's belly button was left inside her where it started to break down ( file picture ) ‘ it did n’t really bother me but he admitted me to hospital overnight			1
’ an ultrasound scan revealed an infection under the scar , which was treated with antibiotics			0
the wound was dressed and drained and mrs @entity6 was then discharged from hospital			0
after returning home , mrs @entity6 started to experience pain and an unexplained foul smelling discharge leaking from her abdomen , which made her feel embarrassed and self - conscious			1
mrs @entity6 became increasingly worried about the recurring leaking and was referred to several specialists			0
the medical teams failed to determine the actual cause of the discharge which was that her old belly button had been left inside her			1
instead , doctors blamed the discharge on an infected stitch			0
the foul smelling contents of mrs @entity6 's stomach started to leak from her abdomen in 2011 , mrs @entity6 felt confident enough to go on holiday to @entity11			1
however , before she caught the return flight , she noticed that there were blisters around where her old belly button should have been			2
once she had boarded the plane , her belly button unexpectedly burst and the area started to leak , causing the passenger next to her to complain about the smell			1
luckily , the air stewardess was able to help her to dress the wound as best she could			0
despite the help from the on - board staff , mrs @entity6 says she felt tearful and embarrassed			0
she had to sit on the aisle seat and keep re-dressing the leaking wound in the toilets			0
mrs @entity6 had to have surgery to reconstruct her belly button ( file picture ) when the plane finally landed , she called her brother to take her immediately to @entity98 in @entity99 , where the wound was cleaned and dressed properly			1
no longer trusting her original surgeon , mrs @entity6 declined the offer of returning to the first hospital , instead choosing @entity104 in @entity105			2
there , it was discovered that her old belly button was still inside her and this had broken down , causing the pain and leaking			1
after undergoing reconstructive surgery , mrs @entity6 was given a new belly button and now experiences no leaking problems			1
mrs @entity6 has now been awarded £ 22,500 in compensation from the surgeon who conducted the operation after the case was settled out of court			1
@entity120 , head of medical negligence at @entity122 , who helped with the case , said : ‘ this case highlights how easy it is for an everyday cosmetic surgery procedure , like a tummy tuck , to go wrong , both with the surgery itself and if the proper after care is not administered			2
‘ mrs @entity6 had the operation to gain confidence , and instead was subjected to years of pain and embarrassment			2
‘ while mrs @entity6 is happy with the final result of the case after years of anger , she is now understandably fearful of undergoing any further surgery , should she need it in the future			0
‘ she is now keen to put this incident behind her and highlight to others the problems of not receiving the proper after care after cosmetic surgery			0
’ mrs @entity6 added : ‘ i was angry when i first contacted @entity149 because i felt that i had been neglected by @entity150 and the surgeon , and it was n’t fair			0
‘ i was extremely pleased with the compensation – @entity149 got me the amount that they could			0
‘ the result of my case means that awareness has been raised and it can hopefully change patient care in the future			0

@entity6 , 68 , had a tummy tuck in a private hospital in 2005
a year later , she started to get pain and discharge from her stomach

then , in 2011 her belly button *suddenly* ' exploded ' on a plane
stomach contents leaked out and a passenger complained about the smell
has now been awarded more than £ 20,000 compensation from the surgeon
