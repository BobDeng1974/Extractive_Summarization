a lamb advertisement aimed at celebrating @entity1 has come under fire for its lack of @entity5 faces			1
the new campaign by @entity7 which features cricket legend @entity8 was released earlier this month but some have criticised the ad for excluding other ethnic minorities			1
in the ad @entity8 , the voice of @entity5 cricket , calls on the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 to join him for a knees up at his waterfront home			1
social commentator @entity33 criticised the advertisement ' to be honest it accurately reflects @entity39 day and all that 's completely wrong with it , ' she said			1
' by that i mean we 've got a bunch of white men who are completely ignoring the fact that there is history in this country that pertains to @entity5 people and our experiences , ' ms @entity33 continued			2
however @entity7 have defended their position saying they extended the invitation for many others to join the campaign , and the ad should be taken lightly			2
' this chapter of the @entity1 lamb campaign was created to capture the spirit of our national day , ' they told @entity64 in a statement			2
' the bringing together of a group of @entity5 legends allowed us to honour some of the people who have helped defined @entity39 , in the most @entity71 way possible – by sharing a lamb barbecue together			0
' @entity73 approached numerous people from a variety of cultural backgrounds to be involved in the @entity1 lamb campaign however on this occasion some politely declined or were unavailable			0
' this @entity1 lamb campaign is not intended to offend ; rather it is a humorous celebration of some of the legendary figures who have made @entity39 great			0
' @entity8 calls captain cook ( left ) and @entity83 star @entity82 ( right ) round to his place for a lamb bbq @entity8 later looks worried when legendary outlaw @entity17 ( left ) offers to ' round up the guys ' for the barbie , while @entity88 ( right ) hinted for an invite but was told there was no barbecue by @entity8 - the cricket legend clearly still bitter about @entity93 's portrayal of him as character , @entity95 journalist and businesswoman @entity96 ( left ) was more than happy to accept the invite from the back of her limousine , and explorers @entity102 ( pictured bottom , in right side image ) and @entity105 ( pictured top , in right side image ) agreed to attend from what looks like the @entity71 outback social media users have had mixed reviews to the advertisement , many branding it entertaining while others have pointed out the obvious lack of multicultural faces			1
released earlier in january , the ad sees @entity119 take on a new role in the annual @entity1 lamb campaign - capturing the spirits by doing what we believe every @entity71 should be doing - organising a big lamb bbq and a game of backyard cricket			1
the @entity5 icon has joined with ' @entity129 ' @entity82 as well as a host of national and historical icons to join him in bringing everyone together to share the most - loved chops and cutlets			1
the advertisement opens on an open sea , with @entity16 aboard his ship as he approaches the @entity5 shore line			0
his steely focus on the path ahead is interrupted by a phone call from @entity8 inviting him to a ' barbie ' at his place on @entity1			0
' cooky ' agrees , and asks if fellow explorers @entity102 and @entity105 are also on the guest list – they 're keen , despite their death - bed - dire situation in a baking hot desert			0
@entity8 captures the spirit by doing what every @entity71 should be doing - organising a big lamb bbq @entity8 captures the spirit of our national day by doing what we believe every @entity71 should be doing on @entity1 ; organising a big lamb bbq and a game of backyard cricket @entity8 later looks worried when legendary outlaw @entity17 offers to ' round up the guys ' for the occasion , although this is less worrying than the rumour that @entity17 has gone ' veggo ' ( in fact he is just gluten intolerant )			1
other iconic @entity71 invited to @entity8 's barbie include iconic cricketer @entity18 , media giant @entity96 , and of course @entity82			2
but when @entity88 – famous for impersonating @entity8 as the 12th man – gets wind of the lamb feast , he 's bluntly told by @entity8 that there 's nothing on			0
@entity8 said : ' in addition to my love of cricket on @entity1 , i wanted to be involved in another key part of our national day , the iconic lamb campaign			1
the @entity182 posted a photograph this month , with a caption : ' never too many @entity185 ! ' a general view of spectators dressed as @entity8 during day two of the fourth test match between @entity39 and @entity189 at @entity190 on wednesday ' for me , this year 's campaign encapsulates what @entity1 is all about ; @entity71 getting together for a lamb bbq			1
' general manager @entity194 at @entity197 @entity196 said : ' as a nation we love our lamb , and it 's our belief that you never lamb alone			0
' that goes double on @entity1			0
@entity8 might not be at the cricket surrounded by his army of fans this year , but he 's still making the most of the day and spending it with this pantheon of notable @entity71			0
