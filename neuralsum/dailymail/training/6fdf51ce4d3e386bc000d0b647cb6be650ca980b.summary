as delicious as they taste , every diner knows that chicken nuggets and hotdogs are n't exactly made from prime cuts of meat			2
indeed , most of us try and push the image of trotter or carcass to the back of our minds when eating processed food			2
now , one photographer has laid bare the grisly reality of where our favourite foods come from - and it 's probably enough to deter you at least temporarily , if not for life			1
while nuggets are chicken feet , a ham sandwich is a pig 's trotter and a hot dog is an unappetising - looking piece of intestine			0
mr @entity20 says the project - inspired by his move to @entity48 - ' is not meant to be repulsive , but to raise awareness ' of where popular dishes actually come from			1
he said : ' arriving in @entity48 for the first time , a city overloaded with visual stimulation , one of the most impactful scenes for me was the meat shops found in my neighbourhood of @entity60			1
' as a foreigner from a major city in the @entity65 , most of us seldom see anything that even closely represents what kind of animal we are eating when we purchase it – it is always pre-packaged , nice and neat , showcased in an air - conditioned supermarket			1
' being forced to pass by these meat shops on a daily basis with their pig heads , intestines , eyeballs and hearts hung on hooks out in the open lead me to challenge myself to view these shops as a normal place where actual food was being sourced every day , that ended up in my meal at a local restaurant			0
' mr @entity20 - who is not vegetarian - says his work , ' a personal therapeutic process ' , explores the relationship that most @entity89 societies have with the meat that they eat			1
' it 's a disconnect between what it actually is they are eating and what it was before it was prepared for consumption			2
' he added : ' shot using a white background with lighting meant to evoke an @entity104 diner or cafeteria , i take out the clean cuts and replace them with a real representation of the animal the meat comes from			2
' by doing this , i hope to cause the viewer to take into account what the natural form of their food looks like			0
' authentic : he hopes the project will help diners think about the natural form their food takes transformed : mr @entity20 admits the project has changed his eating habits			1
' i now make an effort to know where and how the animal i am eating was raised - and the results do dictate if i end up eating it ' mr @entity20 believes his work ' highlights a number of important debates ' - such as the longstanding debate of the quality of chicken and meat products and ' the use of unnatural fillers and hormones in the animal products we eat daily			1
' the project itself was a labour of love - an involved traipsing around until he found a friendly bucher who could speak sufficient @entity143			0
' she thought it was funny , as she could tell i was a little bit uncomfortable being surrounded all the raw meat , ' he recalls			0
in fact , her main focus was food handling and preparation			0
' she did n't understand why a white person wanted all of these things to photograph and was very concerned if i knew how to handle it properly			0
' she also told me how to cook and eat it , which i did not			0
' however he admits the project has changed his eating habits			1
' i now make an effort to know where and how the animal i am eating was raised - and the results do dictate if i end up eating it			2
' not to sound preachy , but i think if more meat eaters did that , i think there would be less animosity from overly passionate vegans			0

@entity20 , who lives in @entity48 , photographed popular dishes alongside the real , raw part of the animal they come from
wanted to raise awareness of what our favourite foods are made from
' few of us see anything that even closely represents the animal we are eating when we purchase it – it is always pre-packaged and neat '
the *non-vegetarian* says the project has changed his own eating habits
