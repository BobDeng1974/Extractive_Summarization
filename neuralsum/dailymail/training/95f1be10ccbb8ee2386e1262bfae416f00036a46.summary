experience has made a wise old bird out of @entity2 – and he plans to take his charges under his wing in his new role as @entity7 ’s batting coach			1
to those who fear for @entity10 being tutored by a man whose introspective tendencies contributed to a scandalously below - par test batting average of 27 , @entity2 himself has an honest riposte : ‘ if i ’d known then what i know now , it would have been great			1
’ eight years after being ditched for good by the selectors following a tricky tour of @entity18 in early 2002 , @entity2 was still churning out the hundreds for @entity20			1
the elegant cover - drive remained intact			2
but he had learned a thing or two about mental strength			0
@entity2 in his part - time role as @entity7 batting coach during the @entity27 test series last summer the 45 - year - old chats to @entity29 during a session at @entity31 in 2012 now , named as @entity33 ’s successor until next september , he has the chance to pass it on : here , the @entity35 are hoping , beginneth the lesson			1
@entity2 offers @entity7 captain @entity10 advice during the @entity39 last summer ‘ people ask me whether i should n’t have done better in my international career , ’ he told @entity40			1
‘ i tell them i can sleep at night because i tried my hardest			0
‘ could i have been more self - aware ? yes , definitely			2
did i learn more after i passed 30 ? yes , definitely			0
if i ’d known then what i know now , it would have been great			0
‘ i ’ve had 25 years in the game , so there ’s a lot of experience to draw on – both good and bad			0
it ’s very important to understand the stresses and strains that go on at international level , the importance of confidence and self - belief , and how fragile they can be			2
‘ i ’ll try to empathise with the players			1
if i see someone struggling or withdrawing or over-thinking – that ’s when i can help			0
’ @entity2 , 45 , observed the process at first hand over the summer as @entity10 appeared at times to be doing battle as much with himself as with the @entity65 and @entity67 bowlers			1
‘ i was struck by the relentless , sustained criticism of the @entity7 captain , ’ said @entity2 , who took on a more hands - on role after @entity7 ’s batsmen surrendered to @entity72 ’s bouncers during the second test against @entity27 at @entity74			1
‘ the demands are huge on a captain these days			0
@entity10 has to do three interviews after the toss , then 10 minutes later he ’s strapping on his pads to open the batting for @entity7			1
‘ if you start to struggle with your game in those circumstances , it can be hugely challenging			0
he showed tremendous strength of character to make that 95 at @entity89			0
’ it was the kind of knock you suspect @entity2 wishes he had been able to summon up more often during his own international career : gritty , unself - conscious , indifferent to whether he had just been beaten outside off			1
and it is the mental side of the game he will be working on now			0
@entity2 plays his favourite shot , a cover drive , for @entity7 against @entity18 in 1999 a dejected @entity2 walks off after being out for 25 against @entity96 in 1991 ‘ when people talk about me as a player , they often think of the technical side , ’ he said			1
‘ but at this level you hope the techniques of the players are pretty good already			2
it ’s more a question of what ’s going on between the ears			0
it ’s helping players to feel confident , reinforcing their beliefs , evolving their game , provoking thought			2
’ @entity2 already has one foot in the door			1
even before he worked part - time with the @entity7 team over the summer , he had coached his old club @entity116 and worked with the @entity117			1
batsmen such as @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 are used to his methods : ‘ they ’re a very talented group			0
’ but his first full - time role will be to help prepare @entity7 for next year ’s @entity125			1
it ’s been nearly 23 years since they last mounted a credible tilt at the title , and expectations are not high			0
@entity2 is congratulated by @entity131 after scoring his 100th first - class hundred in 2008 ‘ it ’s fair to say @entity7 are a wildcard , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ we want to try to take pressure off the players , and if they feel they ’re underdogs , that ’s fine			2
i ’ve seen when playing against teams with nothing to lose that it can really free you up			0
i think that no - fear attitude is the way to go			0
‘ someone like @entity148 looks comfortable and clear with his @entity150 shirt on			0
i want to encourage him to find that clarity whenever he has an @entity7 shirt on too			2
’ and no one can say @entity2 has n’t reached his own clarity the hard way .			2

@entity2 succeeds @entity33 as @entity7 batting coach
' i *'ll* try to empathise with players , ' says 45 - year - old @entity163 batsman
