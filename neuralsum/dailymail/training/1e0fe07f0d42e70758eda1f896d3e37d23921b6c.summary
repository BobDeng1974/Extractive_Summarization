cosmetic cowboys with no medical training will remain free to inject women with ‘ backstreet botox ’ because health ministers have bowed to pressure to leave the industry largely unregulated			1
the @entity7 has learnt that the government is to reject a crucial recommendation in a hard - hitting review of the booming sector , to the outrage of leading doctors			1
this newspaper has been campaigning since march for far tougher regulation of the industry			1
the @entity7 has called for measures including a minimum standard for surgeons ; proper regulation for all those practising cosmetic surgery ; and an end to the hard - sell tactics that see special offers and glossy advertising undermine the seriousness of the procedures involved			1
ministers have bowed to pressure and will leave the industry largely unregulated ministers are worried that regulating the £ 3 billion industry will constrain it in the run - up to the @entity33 – a period during which they want unfettered economic growth			1
but doctors and campaigners believe people ’s health could be put seriously at risk			2
when the review was published in april , health minister dr @entity41 said he agreed entirely with the principles behind its recommendations			2
a key proposal was the creation of a compulsory register for everyone carrying out cosmetic treatments – including @entity3 injections , use of wrinkle - smoothing dermal fillers , and laser hair - removal treatments			1
a crackdown on so - called ' backstreet @entity3 ' is to be shelved over fears that it could harm the economy at the moment these can be carried out by anyone – sometimes with horrifying results			2
but this newspaper has been told that the @entity64 has insisted that any register should be voluntary – meaning ‘ cosmetic cowboys ’ will be able to operate as normal			1
‘ non-surgical cosmetic interventions ’ account for three - quarters of the value of the cosmetics industry and the vast majority of growth in the sector , which will be worth £ 3.6 billion by 2015 having grown five-fold in a decade			1
science writer and broadcaster @entity74 , who sat on the cosmetics review panel , said the lack of a mandatory register was ‘ outrageous ’			2
describing the government ’s expected response as ‘ utterly appalling ’ , ms @entity74 said : ‘ it means people ’s lives will continue to be put at risk			0
‘ we are heading for a public health disaster , just because it fits in with the government ’s growth agenda			0
i believe there ’s an element of chauvinism here , a mindset that ‘ ‘ these are stupid people having these treatments and it ’s their own fault if things go wrong ’ ’			0
’ @entity99 medical director professor sir @entity98 was asked to lead the cosmetics review in the wake of the @entity103 breast implants scandal , which led to thousands of @entity105 women having them taken out			0
last night sir @entity98 said he would be dismayed if the government decided against firm regulation			1
and @entity109 , president of the @entity110 , said a mandatory register was essential			0
@entity112 , 58 , is one of those who has suffered from ‘ @entity3 ’			0
she ended up in casualty after being injected with what she believes was fake botox by a man purporting to be a plastic surgeon			0
the ‘ treatment ’ took place in a friend ’s kitchen			0
mrs @entity112 , a dog trainer from @entity126 in @entity127 , suffered a severe allergic reaction and said : ‘ i could have died			0
the police still do n’t know what i was injected with – it could have been knocked up in someone ’s bathtub			0
‘ i will be very disappointed if the government fails to regulate – it ’s all about money is n’t it ? has someone got to die before they do anything serious about it ? ’ critics claim the cosmetics industry has determinedly lobbied ministers to stop short of a mandatory register			1
firms have funded a body called @entity145 , which launched a voluntary register of ‘ qualified cosmetic injectable providers ’ in 2010 .			2

ministers have bowed to pressure and will leave industry largely unregulated
