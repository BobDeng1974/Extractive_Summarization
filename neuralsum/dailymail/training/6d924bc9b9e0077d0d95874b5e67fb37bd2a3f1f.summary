it 's not only soldiers who need to train for life - threatening situations on the battlefield			1
experts have created a learning tool for army medics so they , too , can practice treating the wounded before putting themselves in the line of fire			1
a 360 - degree virtual training programme has been created using the @entity11 headset to prepare the medical teams for the realities of war			1

this is a view of the scene from the ' controller 's ' point - of - view but medics could get close - ups of wounds in future as well as learn how to look out for enemy fire a terminally ill grandmother with cancer is using an @entity11 virtual reality headset to experience life outside a virtual @entity33 villa , from her armchair in @entity35			1
the idea to use virtual reality to give @entity38 an outdoor experience without leaving her home came from her granddaughter , @entity41 , who works as an artist designing video games			2
she emailed @entity44 about her idea and they sent her a headset , for free , for @entity38 to use			0
before long , @entity38 was walking through a virtual @entity48 villa , trying to catch butterflies and admiring the sunshine			0
' her favorite part was just being able to walk up and down the stairs again of the villa in the @entity55 demo , ' said @entity41			0
' i guess we take a lot of things for granted			0
' the technology uses ‘ head tracking ’ to enable the user to look around the virtual world they have entered , just as they can in real life			0
@entity69 - based developers @entity67 and @entity70 created the virtual simulation using the @entity73 - owned technology , so trainee medics can assist injured soldiers in life - like battle scenarios			1
the simulation emulates pre-hospital care on the battlefield and allows trainees to negotiate and prioritise clinical needs			0
this is designed to teach teamwork and decision - making skills within high - stress ‘ under - fire ’ scenarios , a spokesman explained			2
the prototype , which was funded by the @entity90 's @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , has been ‘ well received ’ and virtual reality training could become common practice in few years			1
a 360 - degree virtual reality training programme for medics working on the battlefield has been created using @entity11 ( pictured ) , which is a headset originally developed for gamers that covers the eyes with two screens presenting a 3d view that looks as though users have entered the world they are playing in the technology uses ' head tracking ' to enable the user to look around the virtual world they have entered , just as they can in real life			1
medics could face frightening scenes of gruesome injuries ( pictured ) in their training one day the simulation technology also has the potential to be applied to other scenarios , such as people training to help with natural disasters or medical training for paramedics			2
‘ our work with @entity89 is enabling us to revolutionise the way medical treatment can be applied in the battlefield , while creating a multitude of opportunities for advanced health training applications across a breadth of industries , ’ said @entity118 , medical business manager at @entity67			0
‘ the innovative technology used in immersive reality solutions enables such a real - life perception that the education and response level of the trainee can be greatly heightened			1
‘ any negative psychological effects could also be improved , by preparing the trainees better with a more accurate vision of what they could experience during military conflict			0

the virtual reality training ground has been created using @entity11
the headset was originally developed to provide immersive gaming
an @entity69 - based firm used the technology to build the life - like battlefield
it was designed to help medics treat soldiers in ' under fire ' scenarios
the technology could be *widely* used to train experts ' within a few years '
