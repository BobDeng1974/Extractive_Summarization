so much has been made of @entity0 and @entity1 this week that we are in danger of missing the main point			1
people have hardly spoken about the fact that he came off the bench , won a free - kick with his ability and helped to change the game and win the three points for @entity1 in their @entity13 against @entity14			1
i know that when you are @entity1 manager you can be distracted by the side - shows away from football			1
perhaps that is inevitable in this tournament , with its new qualification format , which means that @entity1 are already almost certain to qualify			1
the main story is unlikely to be about the game — or at least , let ’s hope not , as it will mean that @entity1 have lost			1
it is tangential issues that will dominate			1
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity0 ( second from left ) watches @entity1 take on @entity14 from the bench in @entity30 the @entity32 star had complained of leg weariness to manager @entity34 the day before the game but , from @entity34 ’s point of view , he has to ensure that he stays focused on the main thing — the match			1
whether @entity0 said he was tired or not and however upset or not @entity32 manager @entity39 is about his player being discussed , @entity1 still won the game			1
and they won it because @entity0 came off the bench and won the free - kick that created the goal at a stage when it looked as though @entity1 might not score from open play			1
you could easily spin the situation on its head and say it was good management			1
the manager kept him hungry , brought him on , he showed a great attitude and changed the game			1
part of the challenge of being the @entity1 manager is that there is a feeling that you are leasing someone ’s car			2
it is not yours and you always have that at the back of your mind as you sometimes have to tread carefully			2
but when a player is on international duty , he is an @entity1 player and the manager has to have the authority to do what he wants			2
essentially , there was nothing wrong with the way @entity77 dealt with the situation			2
whatever the reason for leaving him out — whether it was @entity0 saying he was tired or @entity77 wanting to play a different way — it produced a result			1
i know that off - field issues can overshadow what you do with @entity1			2
i had a similar situation with @entity89 , who was always a focal point for the media , like @entity0 is now			1
@entity89 ( pictured with @entity93 's @entity92 in 1998 ) was a focal point under @entity95 @entity32 manager @entity39 has been pushing the issue with @entity34 over the last week @entity0 came on in the second half and won the free - kick which led to @entity101 's winning goal @entity0 , pictured celebrating a goal against @entity103 , began the season in fine form for @entity32 there is one tournament i do n’t especially want to see @entity0 in — and that ’s the @entity109 in the @entity110 next summer			1
i know it would be lovely to give it our best shot to win it but my feeling is that established senior @entity1 internationals should be resting in the summer			2
it is different for players who have won only a few caps in the senior team			2
@entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 still have things to prove in an @entity1 shirt			2
they should certainly be part of the squad for @entity130			2
but @entity0 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 can justifiably sit it out without anyone questioning their desire or their clubs ’ motives			1
they are established members of @entity1 ’s first @entity142 remember what the development teams are there to do — to develop established players for the senior team			2
and those who have already achieved that goal do n’t need another summer commitment			2
they would be better off resting and focusing on @entity152			1
but you have to keep drawing people back to what is happening on the pitch and i would have focused on that after the game			2
the kid has come on and affected the game — my word , he affected it — and that is all you can ask of your subs			0
what i like about @entity0 is his bravery			1
people might not associate that description with him			0
but bravery is not all about flying tackles and cut heads ; there is bravery on the ball and that counts as well			0
@entity0 has courage to take players on , to try something different and beat people			1
that is what helped change the game			0
he will win plenty of free - kicks and penalties because he has quick feet and pace to get in and around the penalty area			0
it is not like he just does it out wide — he does it in areas that hurt you			0
of course , at @entity194 we have to come up with a plan for stopping him , which is much easier said than done			1
it is very difficult to pin down someone like @entity0 because the laws of the game have changed in favour of the more skilful players , which is one of the reasons why he will be such an asset for club and country			1
the only way to contain such a player is to work hard collectively in all areas of the pitch to minimise the space he has			0
but it is hard to pin him down because he is so comfortable in a variety of positions , something unusual in such a young player			0
whether you play him out wide , just off a front man , at the tip of a diamond or on the edge of the diamond			0
in the modern game , there ’s no need to limit his strengths by defining just one position for him			0
he can play in a variety of roles and that flexibility marks out a good player			0
@entity39 has been critical of @entity1 's treatment of his star players already this season even more encouraging for @entity1 is that @entity131 and @entity124 will push him ; and @entity240 and @entity241 can challenge him in wide positions			0
at 19 , @entity0 is far from his peak			1
he needs to add consistency but , having become a key member of the @entity32 and @entity1 teams , he will come on leaps and bounds			1
we should be celebrating his talent and , at the end of his career , events of the past week will be long forgotten , no doubt seen as something unimportant			0
nurture him and support him and @entity257 football has a talent to enjoy			0
let ’s hope we see much more from him — after the match at @entity261 , of course			0
@entity263 won the @entity264 but even he might be feeling the pressure if @entity266 do not win at @entity267 on tuesday night			0
it is a massive game for them			0
the club clearly want to do well in the @entity271 and at least see some progress , which would mean a quarter - final or the semis this season			0
that is what the @entity266 fans would be expecting			0
if they went out early again , i do n’t think @entity263 would lose his job but he would probably feel he had to win the @entity264 to be safe			0
city have to be aggressive and get six points from this game and the return leg , when @entity267 come to the @entity286 two weeks later			0
that would put them back in the frame to qualify and give @entity263 a chance to do something about @entity266 ’s poor reputation in @entity293			0
@entity266 boss @entity263 will feel the heat should they fail to beat @entity267 on tuesday if there ’s one place i would like to be this week it ’s the @entity299 on wednesday night for the visit of @entity301			0
@entity271 football came back to @entity303 last month but this feels like the kind of fixture @entity32 fans have been waiting for over the last four years			1
there is n’t a stadium in the world that will top the atmosphere that night			0
this @entity301 side remind me of their famous @entity314 team with all their amazing attacking talent — and this time they have better balance to it , with @entity318 and @entity319			0
but @entity32 ought to be inspired for this game			1
maybe the passion of the @entity299 can help them get the result they need to stay in the mix to qualify			0
there wo n't be a stadium in @entity293 to rival @entity303 when @entity32 face @entity301 on wednesday night			1

@entity0 told @entity34 he was too tired to start in @entity14
the @entity32 winger started from the bench in the @entity152 qualifier
@entity0 should start when the @entity332 travel to @entity194 on *sunday*
