by @entity0 and @entity1 once , a certain senior @entity3 figure responded in pugilistic fashion to an egg - throwing protester			1
but @entity6 clearly is n’t cut from the same pugnacious cloth as @entity8			2
when the @entity3 leader was hit on the back of the head yesterday , he simply laughed it off , saying he was ‘ always looking for new ways to connect with voters ’			1
a contrast indeed to the moment in 2001 when then deputy prime minister mr @entity8 lashed out with a left hook after being egged by a countryside campaigner			0
yesterday ’s sticky moment came as mr @entity6 attempted to use a walkabout at a market to attack the government over the rising cost of living			1
it is not the first time mr @entity6 has been hit by an egg - he was struck in a similar protest in may 2012 while on the campaign trail in @entity51			1
the @entity3 leader has been stung by criticism that his party has been silent for the last three weeks , while the coalition has set the political agenda			1
his visit to the south @entity37 's @entity36 was his first return to the frontline since his summer holiday in @entity61			2
but as he tried to convince shoppers he had a plan to help people who are feeling the pinch , he was struck by several eggs			0
he later wrote on @entity41 : ' thanks to all at @entity68 for the warm welcome today			0
can recommend it for easy availability of eggs			0
' @entity72 said mr @entity6 did not want police to take the matter further			2
setback : mr @entity6 had hoped to focus on a claim that the government is ' out of touch ' instead of wiping egg out of his hair message : @entity3 hoped to turn the tables on the government , with wage increases outstripped by the rising cost of living the man who threw the six eggs was 38 - year - old @entity89 , who was homeless for five years and said he had travelled to the street specifically to target mr @entity6			1
as he threw the eggs he joked that he would only have voted for mr @entity6 's brother , @entity92			1
speaking to reporters after the incident , mr @entity89 said : ' they do n't care about the poor , they just care about the banks , they should stop giving favouritism to the banks			0
' the government do nothing , the shadow government do nothing			0
if you 're poor you 're considered a burden			0
' after the incident he was led away from the scene by market security			0
protest : @entity89 , pictured throwing the eggs , said he was protesting at the way the poor are treated by both the government and the opposition two jabs : @entity8 lands a left hook on a countryside campaigner who egged him during 2001 mr @entity6 said : ' this is not the first time it 's happened to me , i 'm sure it 's not the last , " he said			2
" i 'm always looking for new ways to connect with the voters			0
' a surprise new poll this week showed @entity127 and @entity128 have almost doubled their lead over @entity3 for stewardship of the economy			1
according to the @entity135 / @entity134 survey , 40 per cent believe the prime minister and @entity137 are more capable of managing the economy than @entity6 and @entity139			1
just 24 per cent said the @entity3 leader and @entity137 have the right answers – giving the @entity142 a 16 per cent lead			1
it is a dramatic increase from a lead of just nine points last month , and sent shockwaves through the @entity3 as mr @entity6 prepares for another relaunch			1
mr @entity6 has faced calls to beef up his team to take on a resurgent @entity151 party			2
@entity152 called on him to recall @entity3 ’s ‘ grown - ups ’ to frontline politics as he was accused of lacking a ‘ coherent ’ economic policy			1
former minister @entity156 said the @entity3 leader should recall big beasts such as former cabinet ministers @entity159 and @entity161 to help rescue the party			1
he said mr @entity6 needs ‘ a strong , coherent case ’ and ‘ a credible message ’			2
grownups : many in the @entity3 would like to see @entity159 ( left ) and @entity161 return to the frontbench describing them as ‘ grown - ups ’ he said on @entity174 that mr @entity159 was ‘ a very good chancellor and still is a very credible witness on the economy ’ and mr @entity161 was ‘ an immensely credible figure ’			1
mr @entity156 said @entity3 needed to counter the ‘ vast lie ’ that @entity178 ’s economic problems were primarily caused by the previous government			1
he said the ‘ only thing ’ the party had to apologise for was not ‘ regulating the banks sufficiently ’			0
former spin doctor @entity183 also demanded that mr @entity6 get on the front foot over the economy			1
in a blog on his website , mr @entity183 wrote : ‘ the very good record of the last @entity3 government has been blunted if not lost as a political weapon			1
@entity3 must be more robust in defending the record , including the @entity192 , @entity159 handling of the global financial crisis			1
’ former minister @entity195 also said : ‘ if we have little confidence defending [ our ] record , why should anyone believe our forward offer ? ’ mr @entity6 has spent the last three weeks on holiday , sparking unease in @entity3 ranks about the deafening silence of his frontbench			1
with signs the economy is recovering , a growing list of mps and advisers have warned @entity3 needs to up its game			2
@entity192 's former pollster @entity211 warned that @entity3 was ‘ slightly lurching from one announcement to the next , or complete silence ’			2
‘ what voters need to hear is some real clarity about what @entity3 stands for , what @entity3 believes , how @entity3 now would be different from how @entity3 has been before			2
and that needs to be set out with absolute clarity in a language that people understand			0
' it comes after shadow health secretary @entity224 complained that @entity3 must ' shout louder and speak in a way that captures how people are feeling and thinking '			2
economic competence : the @entity151 lead over @entity3 for running the economy has soared from nine points in june to 16 points in august pm @entity127 , left , and chancellor @entity128 , right , have seen a sharp rise in their economic credibility , according to the survey veteran backbenchers @entity236 and @entity238 have also warned mr @entity6 ; s policies are ' confused '			1
however @entity240 , who stood down from the @entity3 frontbench this year , likened mr @entity6 to @entity242 and insisted he was a ' ruthless b * * * * * * ' with the grit to win			1
' the kind of steel within @entity6 is what the @entity142 needed nearly 40 years ago and it 's what our party needed in 2010			1
we still need it today			0
and by 2015 we ’ll need it more than ever , ' he wrote in an article for the @entity254			0
from april to june the economy grew by 0.6 per cent , double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013			0
new @entity258 governor @entity257 last week raised growth forecasts for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent			0
@entity142 have been careful not to declare they can see ‘ green shoots ’ of recovery , with mr @entity128 insisting the economy has moved only from ‘ repair to recovery ’			2
with growth up and unemployment down , @entity3 has been forced to re-rite its attacks on the government , having previously accused ministers of cutting ‘ too far , too fast ’			0
pressure : after three weeks of almost complete silence from the @entity3 leadership , the poll will be another blow for @entity6 and @entity139 ( right ) mr @entity6 's frontbench have instead claimed that the recovery is only being enjoyed by the wealthy			1
but the new message has done nothing to stop voters swinging in behind the @entity151 leadership ’s economic strategy			0
according to the latest @entity135 survey for the @entity134 , the @entity151 lead for ‘ competence ’ on the economy is at its highest level since december 2012			0
to make things worse for @entity3 , the same survey shows that while the party is ahead overall , it is only just			2
on voting intentions mr @entity6 ’s party leads by just 3 per cent , with 35 per cent saying they will vote @entity3 compared with 32 per cent for the conservatives			1
factoring in the margin of error – of plus or minus 3 per cent – shows that the lead may in fact be non-existent			0
the @entity142 have fallen four points over the last month and @entity3 has gone down 1 per cent			0
the poll is the latest blow for mr @entity6 , who is expected to return to the political fray this week with an attack on the government for falling wages in real terms			2
he has faced criticism for three weeks of all but total silence from his frontbench , leaving the coalition to set the political agenda			0
a much - hyped speech on immigration by frontbencher @entity316 turned into a fiasco when large sections attacking @entity319 and @entity320 had to be rewritten after the retail giants hit back at errors in pre-briefed extracts			0
the @entity135 poll shows @entity325 has seen its rating rise from 7 to 10 per cent			0
the poll also shows 17 per cent of people think their personal financial circumstances have improved in the last year , compared to 43 per cent who say it has become worse			0
a quarter believed their situation would improve in the next year .			0
