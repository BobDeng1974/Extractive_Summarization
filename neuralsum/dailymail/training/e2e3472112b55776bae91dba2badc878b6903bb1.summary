by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:32 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 17:48 est , 21 august 2013 @entity3 ’s nuclear crisis escalated yesterday , with fears that more tanks at the wrecked @entity7 plant are leaking contaminated water			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) plans to upgrade the severity of the release from a level 1 ‘ anomaly ’ to a level three ‘ serious incident ’			0
the tanks were hastily built to store water washed over melted reactors at the station to keep them cool in the wake of the 2011 tsunami			0
@entity25 says it has not reached the sea the plant ’s operator , @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , said on tuesday that water with dangerously high levels of radiation is leaking from one tank , but the @entity9 is worried about other tanks of the same type			1
a person standing near the leak would receive five times the annual radiation limit for nuclear workers			1
@entity45 said it was ‘ shocked ’ to hear about the leak and urged @entity3 to provide information ‘ in a timely , thorough and relevant way ’			0
about 300 tonnes of water has breached a storage tank at the plant			2
experts say that after 10 hours , a worker in that proximity to the leak would develop radiation sickness with symptoms including nausea and a drop in white blood cells			1
nuclear chemist and professor emeritus at @entity63 , @entity62 , said : ' that is a huge amount of radiation - the situation is getting worse			2
' it is the latest leak to beset the troubled plant in recent weeks , according to operator @entity25			1
the embattled utility firm @entity25 has struggled to keep the @entity7 site under control since the 2011 natural disaster hit the plant			2
a @entity25 official said that workers who were monitoring storage tanks appeared to have failed to detect the leak of water which pooled up around the tank			1
@entity78 : the operator of @entity3 's crippled @entity7 nuclear plant said about 300 tonnes of contaminated water seeped out of a storage tank he said : ' we failed to discover the leak at an early stage and we need to review not only the tanks but also our monitoring system			1
' the @entity9 's impending assessment upgrade came in a document posted on the agency 's website today			0
the upgrade is set to follow a meeting held by the authority 's commissioners , the @entity9 spokesman said			0
' judging from the amount and the density of the radiation in the contaminated water that leaked ... a level 3 assessment is appropriate , ' the document said			1
following the earthquake and tsunami , @entity7 was assigned the highest rating of @entity107 , when it was hit by explosions after a loss of power and cooling			0
continued contaminated water leaks from @entity7 have alarmed @entity3 's neighbours @entity113 and @entity45			2
@entity25 , also known as @entity25 , has been criticised for its failure to prepare for the disaster and been accused of covering up the extent of the problems at the plant			2
massive amounts of radioactive fluids are accumulating at the @entity7 plant as @entity25 floods reactor cores via a jerry - rigged system to keep melted uranium fuel rods cool and stable			2
the water in the improvised cooling system then flows into basements and trenches that have been leaking since the disaster			0
highly contaminated excess water is pumped out and stored in steel tanks on elevated ground away from the reactors , which lie adjacent to the coast			1
monitor : a group of staff monitor progress at the site of reactor four at the @entity143 nuclear plant about 400 tonnes of radioactive water per day has been pooling and kept in storage at @entity7			1
in order to keep up with the pace of the contaminated water flow , @entity25 has mostly relied on tanks that are bolted together with plastic sealing around the joints			1
those tanks are less robust , but quicker to assemble , than the welded tanks that the utility has recently started installing			0
the latest leak came from the more fragile type of tank , which @entity25 plans to keep using , although it is looking at ways to improve their strength , said @entity25 official @entity160			0
@entity25 said it did not believe that water from the latest leak had reached the ocean , which is only about 500 metres away			0
a puddle that formed near the leaking tank is emitting a radiation dose of 100 millisieverts an hour about 50 centimetres above the water surface , @entity160 told reporters at a press briefing			1
in recent months the plant has been beset with power outages and other problems that have led outside experts to question whether @entity25 is qualified to handle the cleanup , which is unprecedented due to the amount of radioactive material on the site and its coastal location			0
carnage : this is how @entity7 looked after the explosions at the nuclear power plant , caused by a tsunami in 2011 the government said this month it will step up its involvement in the plant 's cleanup , following @entity25 's admission - after months of denial - that leaked contaminated water had reached the ocean			1
@entity25 has also struggled with worker safety			0
this month , 12 workers decommissioning the plant were found to have been contaminated by radiation			2
the utility has not yet identified what caused those incidents , which only came to its notice when alarms sounded as the workers prepared to leave the job site			0
a @entity113 @entity203 spokesman confirmed on tuesday media reports that @entity205 had asked @entity3 officials to publicly explain what they were doing to stop contaminated water reaching the @entity208 and valuable fishing grounds			2
@entity62 said : ' @entity25 and the government must come up with ways to stop the leaks as well as to monitor and analyze how much and what sort of radiation is entering the ocean , as well as the affect it is having on fish and sea plants			0
' they also need to make the information available to the public , all over the world , given this is the first case in history where contaminated water from a nuclear plant is flowing into the ocean at this magnitude			1
' devastating : the nuclear reactor exploded with serious consequences when it was struck by a tsunami that had in turn been caused by an earthquake			0

workers failed to spot highly contaminated water leaking from tank
within one hour workers are exposed to five times annual dose of radiation
exposure for 10 hours would cause sickness and drop in white blood cells
