by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 the forensic dissecting of @entity5 ’s @entity4 hopes by @entity6 and @entity7 looked anything but harsh on wednesday as @entity10 ’s ‘ retro ’ side were comprehensively dismantled by the defending champions			2
@entity14 , such a rabble in the last three tests , came alive once the red ball was swapped for two white ones and provided a lesson to @entity5 on how to play modern 50 - over cricket in conditions that should have suited the hosts perfectly			1
it was @entity6 who said during monday ’s washed - out game at @entity23 that @entity5 ‘ have n’t got a cat in hell ’s chance ’ of winning their first @entity4 next year and , on this evidence , he was being kind to them			2
‘ it was n’t that helpful , especially from a so - called friend and after the summer i ’ve had , ’ said @entity10 after @entity5 ’s thumping 133 - run @entity52 defeat at the @entity55			1
‘ yes i am disappointed because he is a good friend of mine and has been a supporter			0
but it is what it is			0
i am going to be captain in this @entity4 and we have a good chance but if we play like that we ’re not going to win many games			0
’ everything was in @entity5 ’s favour when @entity10 won the toss and @entity72 took two wickets in an over to leave @entity14 on 19 for two in what was effectively the first one - day international of a four - match @entity77 series			1
yet , under grey @entity44 skies and with the ball nipping around , the back - up seam bowlers blew their big chance to maintain the pressure on @entity14 and silence the old players who believe @entity5 are stuck in the one - day dark ages			1
knock : @entity86 and captain @entity10 ( right ) raised hopes in a solid opening stand of 54 slip and slide : @entity89 survives a run out attempt before eventually being caught for 28 @entity92 , in particular , had a nightmare , bowling 12 wides in 10 expensive , wicketless overs and later departing second ball as @entity5 capitulated to a miserable 161 in reply to @entity14 ’s formidable 304 for six			1
those @entity99 riches owed much to a 74 - ball century from @entity36 , not good enough for @entity101 but a formidable proposition in the shorter game , but also to old - fashioned application that is meant to be @entity5 ’s preserve			1
firstly @entity105 and @entity106 rebuilt @entity14 ’s innings as @entity92 and @entity108 , preferred to @entity109 and @entity110 , bowled woefully and then @entity36 ran wild in company with his rejuvenated captain @entity35			2
@entity35 looked uninterested and tired as @entity5 ultimately thrashed @entity14 in the test series but here he was bristling and imaginative , a perfect summation of the modern priorities of the most powerful nation in cricket			1
as , too , was the presence in @entity119 of a large number of @entity99 supporters , as many as 40 per cent of the 14,000 crowd , who were conspicuous by their absence during the five tests , a worry for the health of the ultimate game			0
@entity5 , in contrast , have always paid lip service to limited - overs cricket but have perennially struggled to find a winning formula and look as far away as ever as they embark on their extensive six - month one - day @entity4 build - up			2
@entity134 : @entity14 's @entity36 celebrates getting 100 runs against @entity5 as he inspired his side to victory @entity138 down : @entity38 walks off back to the pavillion after being dismissed in @entity44 one of their enduring problems is a lack of penetration in the middle overs and that was exposed here as @entity36 and @entity35 added 144 off just 16.5 overs to change the complexion of what looked likely to be a low - scoring game			1
there was one huge slice of luck for @entity14 when @entity36 should have been given out lbw sweeping @entity153 on 17 but , after that carnage ensued , with only @entity72 and @entity153 able to limit the damage on @entity5			1
much of the criticism from @entity6 and @entity7 centred on a perceived lack of power in the @entity5 line - up and certainly there was considerable expectations on the shoulders of @entity38 on his 50 - over debut			2
yet @entity38 acquitted himself well and showed he has a solid technique as well as power in top scoring with 40 but becoming bogged down while everyone around him floundered on a pitch that had been spiced up by showers			0
out : @entity14 's @entity170 ( left ) congratulates team - mate @entity40 after the dismissal of @entity38 i 'll take that : @entity38 ( left ) hits the ball back to @entity14 's @entity175 during the second odi in @entity44 @entity10 could at least point to an unlucky dismissal as the ball from @entity179 that trapped him lbw was shown to have pitched fractionally outside leg - stump but there was little to excuse the bulk of his under - performing side			1
the @entity5 captain had added 54 with @entity86 but after he fell his ship quickly sank , all 10 @entity5 wickets falling for 107 in just 28.1 overs			0
a thrashing by any standards			0
‘ we were n’t at the races and i do n’t know why , ’ added @entity10			0
‘ it ’s frustrating but it ’s one game and we will now dust ourselves off and try to play better next time			0
we ’ve got a lot of improving to do			0
’ when @entity5 were thrashed by @entity195 in @entity196 earlier this season they immediately came back with a convincing victory at @entity198			0
time will tell whether they can do the same against @entity14 at @entity200 on saturday			0
jubilation : the @entity14 team celebrate after beating @entity5 by 133 run on wednesday			1
