the terrorist organisation released shocking footage at the end of february purportedly showing jihadis destroying 3,000 - year - old artworks with sledgehammers in their northern @entity2 stronghold			1
but now @entity19 museum director @entity18 has ridiculed @entity21 ' propaganda exercise , claiming the genuine priceless @entity23 and @entity24 statues and sculptures are still safely in his possession in the @entity2 capital , adding that those in @entity6 were plaster cast replicas			1
sick : the terrorist organisation released shocking footage at the end of february purportedly showing jihadis destroying 3,000 - year - old artworks with sledgehammers in their northern @entity2 stronghold speaking to @entity34 news programme @entity32 , @entity31 said : ' none of the artifacts are originals ... they were copies			1
the originals are all here			0
' the museum director 's claims appear to back - up those made by experts on the @entity2 statues			1
within hours of the original @entity21 propaganda video being released , analysts questioned why the statues appeared to crumble so easily			1
others stated that they could n't possibly be 3,000 years old as some of the are clearly held together by iron poles - a considerably more modern practice			2
@entity52 , an expert at the @entity53 at @entity54 , @entity55 , told @entity56 at the time : ' you can see iron bars inside ... the originals do n't have iron bars			1
' propaganda : @entity19 museum director @entity18 ridiculed @entity21 ' video , claiming the genuine @entity23 and @entity24 statues are safely in @entity19 and that those in @entity6 were plaster cast replicas following the february video release , @entity6 's exiled governor @entity68 also stated that the vast majority of the statues were fakes , but added that at least two of those destroyed were originals			1
' there were two items that were real and which the militants destroyed			0
one is a @entity82 and the other was the @entity84 of @entity85 , ' the @entity81 - based @entity80 news organisation quoted him as saying			0
the @entity82 , which is seen being smashed with sledgehammers in the video , is probably one which stood at the gates of @entity90 in the 7th century @entity91 , claimed the @entity92			0
' i think the @entity82 is very important locally , because it 's one of the few objects that has n't left the country or gone to @entity19 , ' @entity93 , chair of the @entity94 , told the news organisation			2
@entity99 : an @entity21 militant uses a power tool to destroy a 7th century winged - bull @entity23 protective deity			2
the statue is thought to have been one of only two genuine artifacts destroyed by @entity21 in the video until 2003 , @entity6 museum had the second biggest collection of ancient relics in @entity2 , including thousands of items from @entity90 and other ancient centers of @entity112			1
amid the @entity115 military operation against @entity116 that year , looters ransacked the building			0
employees managed to save the majority of the items , and then moved most to @entity19			2
@entity21 militants began destroying ancient statues and monuments shortly after they first seized control of @entity6 last summer , describing them as ' worthless idols '			2
a man shown in the video said the items were being destroyed because they promoted idolatry			0
' @entity131 ordered us to get rid of statues and relics , and his companions did the same when they conquered countries after him , ' the unidentified man said			0
historic loss : large segments of the priceless winged - bull @entity23 protective deity are hurled to the ground as militants smash it to pieces @entity6 , the biggest city in the @entity4 group 's self - declared caliphate , boasts a relatively educated , diverse population that seeks to preserve its heritage sites and libraries			0
in the chaos that followed the @entity153 - led invasion of 2003 that toppled @entity116 , residents near the @entity150 hid some of its centuries - old manuscripts in their own homes to prevent their theft or destruction by looters			0
but this time , the @entity4 group has made the penalty for such actions death			0
a @entity164 history professor , who spoke on condition he not be named because of his fear of the @entity4 group , said the extremists started wrecking the collections of other public libraries in december			0
he reported particularly heavy damage to the archives of a @entity173 library , the library of the 265 - year - old @entity175 and @entity176 of the @entity178 fathers and the @entity179 with works dating back to 5000 bc.			1

@entity21 jihadis released video showing the destruction of ' ancient ' sculptures
but the ancient artifacts destroyed were mostly fake , art expert claims
director of @entity19 museum says he is looking after *authentic* *versions*
sculptures seen in film were almost all plaster cast replicas , which *explains* why they crumbled so easily and were held together by iron bars
but two genuine 3,000 - year - old statues were destroyed by the terrorists
