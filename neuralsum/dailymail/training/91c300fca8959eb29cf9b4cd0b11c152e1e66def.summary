by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 18:07 est , 27 october 2013 in his map , a history of @entity3 in the @entity4 , scientist @entity1 has tracked the building of houses around the country from pre- 1930s to now			1
the maps uses shades of purple and yellow to show when the most houses were built in a given county			2
the map shows that vast swathes of the country 's homes in the @entity20 and @entity21 were built in the 1900s , and even more in the @entity23 and @entity24 were built in the 1930s or before			1
visual statistics : in the pale yellow counties , more homes were built pre- 1930s than in any other period , and the darker counties have mostly modern structures there are only two counties in the whole country in which houses from the 1940 predominate , @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36 , @entity37			1
three counties have predominantly homes built from 2005 to 2013 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity41 and @entity43 , @entity44			2
@entity42 was one of three @entity41 towns most heavily hit by @entity47 , which explains its plurality of new homes			2
@entity43 was also severely struck			0
@entity40 was similarly decimated by @entity50 in 2005 and @entity51 in 2008			0
home school : this graph shows the distribution of construction in another way @entity1 says that according to his map , the typical county would have mostly houses built in the 1970s , then an even distribution of pre- 1940 , 1980s , and 1990s houses , then an even distribution of 1950s , 1960s , and post- 2000 houses , and the smallest number of houses from the 1940s			1
@entity1 said he became interested in the distribution of construction eras after he and his wife moved to @entity70 into a house built in 2006			0
previously , the couple had lived in a 1930s condo in @entity74 , @entity75			0
@entity1 's blog @entity77 is an outlet for his ' passion for data visualization			0

it shows that three towns hit by *hurricanes* have the most new homes and many parts of the @entity23 and @entity24 have *primarily* homes built in the 1930s or before
