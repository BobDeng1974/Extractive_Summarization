by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:58 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 20:50 est , 5 december 2012 @entity4 ’s @entity3 dream looks to have come to an abrupt halt			1
@entity7 ’s biggest retailer says its chain of 200 @entity10 stores will either be sold or closed			1
the supermarket ’s failure to crack the cut - throat @entity3 market is a major blow to the group which has been battling to turn around its @entity7 business following a shock profit warning at the beginning of the year			1
the supermarket giant , which failed to make a dent in established @entity3 brands such as @entity38 , is due to give a third - quarter trading update to the @entity40 this morning			0
the brand was launched in 2007 but has never made a profit , losing £ 74 million in the first half of this year , which was itself 1.4 per cent improvement on the same period in 2011			2
@entity45 admitted the non-food performance was ' not good enough ' @entity20 , who ran the @entity3 business and has been with @entity4 for 30 years , has announced he will leave the company			1
mr @entity45 said his priority was to deliver long - term value for shareholders and said @entity10 could not make a profit in an acceptable time frame			2
' whilst the business has many positives , its journey to scale and acceptable returns will take too long , ' he said			0
the supermarket giant had anticipated spreading their huge wings across the @entity60 and making their @entity10 stores as successful as their @entity7 operation			1
the first @entity10 store opened in november 2007 , and was joined by shops in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
but despite vigorous planning - including testing stores and studying how @entity3 families ate and what their buying habits were - the chain failed to compete with established big chains like @entity38			0
the business said it had been approached in recent months from parties interested in @entity10			2
@entity4 was unavailable for comment on the report last night , ahead of today 's announcement , but will report back on the @entity10 review when it posts full - year results in april			1
it came as they also admitted a key part of its performance in the @entity7 was still not good enough			0
the high street giant posted its first fall in profits since 1994 - a 12 per cent drop to £ 1.7 billion - in october			0
after six consecutive quarters of falling like - for - like sales , the @entity7 's biggest supermarket chain managed just 0.1 per cent growth in the second quarter of its financial year as its £ 1 billion turnaround revamp launched			1
despite the news that @entity4 's @entity3 operation has not been a success , the supermarket chain 's shares rose today by four per cent @entity10 failed to make a dent on the big brands such as @entity38 , popular with @entity3 shoppers but the significant investment - spent on a range of initiatives from 8,000 extra staff to launching its everyday value range - took a chunk out of its @entity7 profits			1
in the @entity7 , @entity4 said its sales fell back into the red in its third quarter after a poor non-food performance held back improvements in its grocery arm			1
chief executive @entity45 admitted the non-food performance was ' not good enough ' as the group reported a 0.6 per cent fall in like - for - like sales excluding vat and fuel in the 13 weeks to november 24			0
today , however , the group 's shares rose four per cent today to 340p			0
to compound its woes , @entity4 ’s international arm , once the driving force behind the group , saw profits fall 17 per cent to £ 378 million as shopping restrictions in @entity126 and the eurozone crisis hit @entity128 and @entity129 respectively			2
at the time , chief executive @entity45 said : ' i would n’t say we ’ve turned a corner , but we ’re definitely on the road			0
' mr @entity45 , who started his career stacking shelves in a @entity4 store , took over from sir @entity137 in 2011 , having previously been international and it director .			0
