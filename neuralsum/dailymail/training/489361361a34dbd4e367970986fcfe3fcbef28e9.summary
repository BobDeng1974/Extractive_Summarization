@entity3 , 49 , from @entity17 in @entity4 , was told she was liable to pay a spare room subsidy , because the local authority said her twin sons ' home was on their base			1
@entity23 is a member of the @entity24 while @entity25 is in the 2nd @entity26			1
the row broke out after the council said that ms @entity3 would be liable to pay £ 25 a week for her sons ' rooms , despite the government announcing last march that families with children in the armed forces would be exempt			1
but ms @entity3 disagreed and , threatened by the prospect of losing £ 1,000 a year , took the council to tribunal			1
she won her case along with a refund of around £ 700 , a decision which could open the floodgates to other military families affected by the reforms			1
ms @entity3 said : ' it was overwhelming seeing the decision in writing although i was very confident going in			2
' miss @entity3 , who started fighting against the scheme in november 2012 , said : ' we challenged the @entity31 and we were overwhelmed in april when they said the armed forces were exempt			1
' but then i hit another brick wall			0
' in my head it was morally wrong			0
i could n't believe that the government would announce that the armed forces would be exempt when in effect they were not			0
' when i read the amendment myself it was as plain as the nose on my face that we should be exempt			0
' despite winning her case , ms @entity3 has now chosen to move into a smaller home as @entity23 has just got married			1
twin soldiers : her son @entity25 is in the 2nd @entity66 and @entity23 is a member of the @entity24 victory : the mother of the two soldiers took her case to a tribunal and won			1
she was also handed a £ 700 refund the @entity74 criminology graduate said : ' i 'm happy i 've won			1
i am moving to a smaller property but i wanted to carry this through			0
' it was not just about me but other families too			0
' mrs @entity3 is one of the tens of thousands of tenants wrongly hit by the reforms			2
she confronted the prime minister with her plight in february last year and @entity85 leader @entity84 said the first decision was ' unfair '			0
tragic case : the parents of @entity89 ( pictured ) were told they would have to pay more than £ 600 a year to keep her room untouched after she died of cancer in january 2012 in april 2013 the so - called ' bedroom tax ' was introduced , reducing the amount of housing benefits people can receive if they have a spare room			1
it saw social housing tenants with an extra room docked an average of £ 14 a week in benefits			2
around 660,000 lost some of their housing benefit from the change , which the @entity31 said would save £ 465million a year			1
under the guidelines two children under 16 of same gender are expected to share while two children under 10 expected to share regardless of their gender			0
@entity112 carers are allowed an additional room so long as they have fostered a child			0
the rules also state the adult children in the @entity117 should be treated as continuing to live at home when deployed on operations			0
the charge was aimed at reducing over-crowding in social housing and directing benefits towards those who are most in need			0
it impacted separated parents who shared the care of their children and parents whose children visit but are not part of the household			0
the reforms have tipped nearly one in three affected council tenants into rent arrears and many have faced eviction because they can not afford to pay			2
since the reform was introduced in , 50,000 households in 114 local council areas can no longer afford to pay for their accommodation			2
government rules decree a child aged under 16 in a home receiving housing benefit has to share a room with a sibling of the same gender			2
last year , the parents of a young cancer victim were told they would have to pay more than £ 650 a year to keep her untouched bedroom when charges for under - occupied homes came into force			2
the ashes of seven - year - old @entity89 were been kept in her bedroom at the family home in @entity160 , which was left exactly as it was when she lost her battle with brain cancer in january 2012 .			0
