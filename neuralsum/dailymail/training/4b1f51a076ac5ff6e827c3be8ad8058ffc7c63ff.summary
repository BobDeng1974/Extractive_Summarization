alcoholics and junkies are getting almost half a billion pounds a year in sickness benefits , shock figures reveal			1
an investigation by @entity5 has uncovered the true scale of welfare payouts to addicts , despite repeated attempts by ministers to crack down on @entity12 ’s benefits culture			2
it can be revealed today that : wasted cash : alcoholics and drug abusers are receiving welfare payments worth almost half a billion pounds a year ( picture posed by model ) last night , @entity21 mp @entity20 , who sits on the @entity22 , said : ‘ we should be helping them get off their addictions and get into work , not leaving them to be stuck at home , which is not good for them			1
the better way to spend public money is to help people get past their addictions and get them fit to work rather than paying benefits while they stay addicted			2
’ @entity21 mp @entity35 , until recently chairwoman of the @entity37 on @entity38 , said : ‘ if addicts are simply given cash with no link to proper treatment and recovery , then nothing will ever change			0
’ figures uncovered by this newspaper show there were 1,921,340 people across @entity12 on sickness benefits – now known as @entity50 ( @entity50 ) – in 2013 - 14 , receiving annual payments totalling £ 10.4billion			1
of these , 46,810 received the payment mainly because of their alcohol misuse and a further 28,440 had a ‘ primary disabling condition ’ of drug addiction			0
the alcoholics received £ 249.8million in @entity50 and the drug addicts £ 156.7 million			2
on top of this , substance abusers still getting the old @entity61 last year received £ 26.3million , and a further £ 2.2million went on @entity62			0
it means addicts received £ 435million in sickness benefits in one year			1
most will also be entitled to @entity66 – up to £ 400 a week for large families – and a discount on @entity69			2
but even this underestimates the true number of addicts receiving sickness benefits , as many will qualify for @entity50 as a result of having other problems such as mental illness or physical disabilities			1
more than 75,000 people are signed off work and being paid up to £ 108 a week in sickness pay – more than jobseekers get – because of conditions related to drink or drug abuse ( picture posed by model ) thousands of other addicts who are unemployed but deemed fit to work receive @entity88 of £ 72.40 a week			1
shockingly , the statistics obtained under freedom of information laws reveal that some of the addicts are teenagers			0
there were 1,030 alcoholics aged between 18 and 24 receiving @entity50 , along with 930 drug addicts of the same ages – and 20 aged under 18			2
the greatest number of alcoholics on sickness benefit live in @entity99 ( 400 ) , followed by @entity100 ( 290 ) , @entity101 ( 250 ) , @entity102 ( 200 ) and @entity103 ( 190 )			1
most drug addicts on @entity50 lived in @entity103 ( 340 ) , followed by @entity101 ( 270 ) , @entity99 ( 200 ) , @entity105 ( 150 ) and @entity106 ( 140 )			0
junkies and alcoholics are also entitled to help with housing and council tax bills , as well as @entity112 rehab and detox treatment the number of addicts claiming sickness benefit has barely changed despite attempts by @entity119 @entity118 to get people back into work			1
a @entity123 document admits the proportion of alcoholics getting @entity50 ‘ has remained largely unchanged ’ while the number of drug addicts in the system has fallen by just 0.5 percentage points			0
this is despite the supposedly tough @entity131 , introduced to find out what activities claimants can take part in , as well as to weed out undeserving claimants			0
the assessments are only meant to help people who have serious conditions that leave them unable to work			0
one recent case , however , shows that a drinker originally deemed to be simply lazy has been allowed to claim @entity50			2
court papers seen by @entity5 show that the 30 - year - old lives with his mother in @entity99 and had been paid sickness benefit for eight years when he was told to apply again under the new system			1
he admitted he had no trouble with physical functions but had ‘ no motivation to … get up , get dressed , get washed etc ’ and that ‘ my mother does almost everything for me ’			0
a nurse who interviewed the unnamed man said he ‘ would drink ten to 12 cans of lager daily ’ and had ‘ anxiety and depression ’ as well as ‘ alcohol misuse ’ for a decade – but added that his minimal activity ‘ appears to be through choice rather than illness ’			1
he was initially refused @entity50 but appealed			0
in january 2013 a three - judge panel ruled that alcohol dependency did count as a ‘ specific disease or bodily or mental disablement ’ even if it was ‘ self - inflicted ’			0
@entity169 confirmed last night that the man has since won a fresh hearing and is now receiving sickness benefit			1
a spokesman for the @entity123 said : ‘ this government has set out to change the way drug treatment is perceived and delivered - above all prioritising full recovery rather than short - term fixes			0
‘ there is an increasing rate of people coming out of rehab who have successfully completed treatment and left entirely drug - free - with the latest statistics showing a rise of 15,000 people in @entity188 compared to 5 years earlier			1
’ the @entity123 added : ‘ having a drug or alcohol addiction does not entitle someone to sickness benefits , but the associated long - term health effects may			1
‘ we are reforming disability benefits by introducing a new face - to - face assessment and more regular reviews - something missing under the old system			0
‘ but , ultimately , if a person ’s health conditions render them genuinely unable to work , they need to be supported			0

man lay in bed drinking 12 cans of lager a day was paid sickness benefit - even though **experts** said he was just lazy
