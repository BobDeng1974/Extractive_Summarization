a common viral infection could increase a person 's risk of developing diabetes later in life - and they may not even realise they have contracted it			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) is part of the herpes family and can be sexually - transmitted			1
it can also be spread via coughs and sneezes and it is estimated around half of all adults have been infected			1
the virus tends to remain dormant and most people do n't exhibit any symptoms , but if they do they are similar to flu			1
around half of people in the @entity22 are thought to be infected with the @entity8 however , new research from @entity24 and the @entity25 in @entity26 suggests it is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes in the elderly			1
they found adults aged 85 and over who were infected with cytomegalovirus were about twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes compared with those not infected			2
the team analysed information from more than 500 elderly adults in the @entity39			2
around 80 per cent were infected with cytomegalovirus and 15 per cent had type 2 diabetes			2
while 17 percent of those infected with cytomegalovirus had type 2 diabetes , only 7.9 per cent of those without the virus had the condition			0
people with type 2 diabetes tend to have their blood glucose levels checked every two to six months obesity and aging are known to be associated with insulin resistance , one of the first signs of type 2 diabetes			0
however , only a third of these people go on to develop the condition			0
those who develop type 2 diabetes usually have raised levels of biological markers for inflammation such as larger numbers of active white blood cells			0
the researchers found chronic infections including @entity8 can ' stress ' the immune system			1
they suggested the virus could be acting directly on pancreatic cells or indirectly by causing the immune system to attack the pancreas			0
the study appears in @entity75 's open access journal @entity76 .			0

the @entity8 is part of the herpes family and tends to remain dormant
