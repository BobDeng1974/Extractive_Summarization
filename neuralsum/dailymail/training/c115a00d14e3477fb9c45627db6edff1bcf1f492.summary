devastated : @entity0 claimed to have suffered a stress disorder after the death of his partner @entity3 one of @entity5 ’s most senior doctors has hit out at colleagues who diagnose rape victims and ex-servicemen with post-traumatic stress disorder at the ‘ drop of a hat ’			1
professor @entity12 , a former president of the @entity13 , suggests the condition is not a true mental illness but instead is being diagnosed as a result of the influence of ‘ insurance firms and drug manufacturers ’			1
he claims labelling patients with the term could delay recovery and worsen the problems			1
famous sufferers are said to include singer @entity25 , who developed symptoms including panic attacks and social anxiety after forgetting the words to one of her songs while performing in @entity32 in the 1960s			1
more recently , @entity33 star @entity0 was claimed to have suffered a ‘ traumatic stress disorder ’ as a result of the suicide of his partner @entity3 , leading to him postponing several tour dates			1
@entity38 comprises a number of psychological symptoms resulting from a distressing , life - threatening event			0
they must occur for more than one month and include anxiety , insomnia , flashbacks , nightmares , sudden angry or irrational outbursts , an ability to remember parts of the traumatic event , and an avoidance of anything that reminds the sufferer of what happened			2
the term was coined in 1978 by the @entity56 , and is a more modern version of what was dubbed shell shock after the @entity60			2
the new label is included in the latest edition the @entity63 , published by the @entity64 – the most influential and widely used reference tool in psychiatry			0
rather than being a cohesive , well - defined and meaningful condition such as depression , prof @entity12 says that @entity38 is merely a ‘ cultural construct that is a reflection of the @entity70 healthcare system , which is dictated by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies ’			1
he adds : ‘ in @entity70 , which gave birth both to the term ptsd and the @entity63 , psychiatrists can not be paid unless there is a diagnosis in the book , leading to a tendency to medicalise every condition			1
’ the vast array of triggers and degrees of severity are what has led prof @entity12 – current president of the @entity85 – to doubt the diagnosis			1
‘ the term ptsd is being over-used			1
it is being applied loosely , and doctors are diagnosing it much more readily than they should – at the drop of a hat			0
people assume now that if you have a traumatic event you will get ptsd			0
people are looking for it			0
i think it is quite possible that giving a diagnosis like that would hinder recovery			2
professor @entity12 ( pictured ) suggests condition is not a true mental illness and believes it is being diagnosed due to the influence of ‘ insurance firms and drug manufacturers ’ ‘ it may send the clinician in the wrong direction because it might be clinical depression or anxiety			1
the patient then gets given the wrong treatments , like psychotherapy , rather than antidepressants			0
’ many argue that talking treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity115 ) help speed up recovery from @entity38			1
but prof @entity12 , awarded a cbe in 2012 for services to psychiatry , is unconvinced			1
‘ is @entity115 working because it ’s tackling underlying depression ? or because it is the appropriate treatment for @entity38 ? we do n’t know , ’ he says			2
‘ inevitably if you give people a label they behave according to the label			2
receiving this diagnosis can reaffirm for the patient the idea that he or she remains traumatised and may therefore struggle to believe they will recover , which could become self - fulfilling			0
’ prof @entity12 says he has never given a patient a diagnosis of @entity38 , but does accept the distress and the existence of mental - health problems following trauma			1
‘ there ’s no doubt some people become anxious and experience some of the symptoms described after a traumatic event , but @entity38 is a ragbag of experiences , and the only symptom not otherwise described or included in other psychiatric diagnoses is flashbacks , ’ he adds			2
the condition is most commonly associated with soldiers returning from conflict , but it has also been linked with victims of violent crime and even women who have extremely painful experiences while giving birth			0
dr @entity156 , director of medical services at @entity158 , the organisation devoted to the mental health of returning troops , said : ‘ as a diagnostic category , @entity38 is useful as it determines the evidence - based treatment the patient will receive			2
these may not be delivered otherwise			0
however , labelling an individual with @entity38 when it is not present can harm the patient			0
‘ at @entity158 we are currently supporting more than 5,600 veterans seeking our help – of these three - quarters have a primary diagnosis of @entity38			0
most have been exposed to multiple military - related psychological traumas , mainly involving combat			0
the diagnosis of ptsd at @entity158 is made by a senior psychiatrist and psychologist using clinical assessment , as well as psychometric measurement			0
‘ treatments are geared towards trauma - focused therapies , which are evidence - based and can reduce or altogether stop symptoms of ptsd and improve function			0

professor @entity12 suggests condition is not a true mental illness
instead , he believes it is being diagnosed due to the influence of ‘ insurance firms and drug manufacturers ’
says labelling patients with term could delay recovery and worsen issues
