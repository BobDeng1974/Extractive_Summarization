by @entity0 @entity1 suffers from a rare condition which means she has never felt pain or cried for most children , a grazed knee - and the tears that follow - are a normal part of childhood			1
but @entity1 has never had such an experience - because she is unable to feel pain			1
the nine - year - old suffers from a rare condition which means the two sides of her brain are not connected as they should be			1
called agenesis of the corpus callosum ( @entity18 ) , the disorder means even when @entity19 touches a hot stove that burns her , she will not react			1
the schoolgirl ’s condition - which has given her an extremely high pain threshold - is so rare only around 50 cases have been recorded worldwide			1
it also means she is unable to describe pain - and has never cried - despite battling bugs , colds , chicken pox , tonsillitis			1
her mother @entity31 , 37 , said : ' like all children do , @entity19 will fall down and graze herself - but she does n’t react to it			2
' she has never once cried - and i began to wonder if she had any tear ducts			2
' when she gets ill and is admitted to hospital , i can see she is confused because she ca n’t feel anything is wrong			0
' ' she once put her finger on the hot stove - but carried on playing as though nothing had happened , while i rushed around trying to get water for the burn			2
' another time her forehead was green with bruises - but she was n’t phased at all			2
@entity19 was diagnosed with @entity18 when she was 19 months old			0
the condition is defined as complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum - the structure that connects the two hemispheres of the brain			1
@entity19 with her mother , @entity31			0
her condition - where the two sides of her brain are not connected as they should be - means she is unable to even describe pain even after cutting her knee during a @entity58 lesson , @entity19 felt no pain - and when admitted to hospital to treat her various other ailments , she struggles to understand why she is there the condition occurs when the nerve fibres that make up the corpus callosum do not form - meaning signals can not be passed back and forth between the hemispheres of the brain			1
the rare genetic chromosome disorder also causes underdevelopment in parts of the brain , so @entity19 struggles to understand social cues			0
ms @entity1 , from @entity73 , @entity74 , added : ' i always have to make sure @entity19 is in a safe space so she ca n’t hurt herself - and do n’t take her too situations which may trigger any confusion for her			1
