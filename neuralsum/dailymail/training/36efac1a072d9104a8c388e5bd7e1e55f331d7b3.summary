@entity0 snorts in derision and dismisses with a smile the suggestion that it is the first cup he won as a manager			1
and @entity5 says he can not even remember scoring the winning goal			0
but @entity8 's 3 - 0 win over @entity9 in the @entity11 final of 2000 in the modest @entity12 of @entity13 , nonetheless , remains a match of great significance for today 's @entity17 and @entity18 managers			1
though @entity0 has gone on to win more precious silverware , it was the first time he won something in charge of a team and he did so under the tutorship of his mentor and sunday 's opponent @entity26			1
@entity26 ( left ) talks with @entity0 ( right ) during their spell together at @entity8 @entity0 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) have gone on to become two of @entity32 's most successful managers the pair , pictured at @entity8 , will be reunited when @entity17 host @entity18 at @entity34 on sunday the relationship between @entity29 and @entity0 has been much discussed , not least since @entity29 paid a fulsome tribute to @entity0 last january at the @entity38 tribute night			1
@entity0 was expecting the sack when @entity29 was appointed as the new coach of @entity8 in 1999 , with his previous mentor , @entity41 , being ushered into an upstairs role			1
perhaps that explains why the 36 - year - old @entity0 angrily took @entity8 directors to task in a swish restaurant where the arrangements were being discussed with @entity29 , @entity41 and @entity0			1
after all , he alone would be unemployed at the end of it all			0
back then he was a mere appendage to @entity41 , dismissed internally as ' the translator '			0
' i liked his loyalty and anger , ' he said			0
' and here was a man who already knew the club and could be useful			0
' when the call came , @entity0 was preparing to leave the club			2
' he had expected the sack at that time and was astonished when @entity29 offered him a role , ' said a friend of @entity0			1
' i remember him ringing me up to say he had been offered the job and was absolutely stunned			0
' he was to become @entity29 's most favoured assistant , even though a @entity65 , @entity66 — still with @entity29 at @entity17 as his goalkeeping coach — and @entity68 as well as @entity8 favourite , @entity69 , were on his staff			1
' soon it was clear that he was the assistant @entity29 trusted most , even though he had n't previously known him , ' said @entity0 's friend			1
' for one thing , he had been there for years and knew the club and the players			0
and the players really liked him			0
' how @entity17 and @entity18 could line - up at @entity34 on sunday afternoon @entity0 greets @entity29 before the 2010 @entity77 final between @entity78 and @entity79 @entity29 ( left ) made @entity0 ( right ) in charge of opposition scouting reports during their time at @entity8 @entity0 and @entity29 share a joke prior to a friendly between @entity86 and @entity79 in 2010 there was an unwitting role for former @entity90 winger @entity89 , too			1
@entity91 der @entity68 prepared scouting reports for @entity29 and , when @entity8 drew @entity90 in the @entity77 , @entity91 der @entity68 was dismissive of @entity89 , telling @entity29 and left - back @entity93 they had nothing to fear from him			1
yet on the night @entity89 was unstoppable , setting up two goals as @entity98 's hat - trick saw @entity90 win the game 3 - 2			2
to be fair to @entity101 , @entity89 's performance was exceptional and hardly typical of his career			0
but it was enough to give @entity0 a break			2
' after that @entity91 der @entity68 was out and @entity0 was in , ' said a member of the club 's staff at the time			1
@entity101 was still an important part of the staff but was no longer in charge of the scouting reports ; instead @entity0 's meticulous dossiers became the norm for @entity8 players			1
further signs that @entity0 was @entity29 's star pupil came when he handed over the reins of the first team for the @entity120 tournament			1
@entity121 the date : march 25 , 1998			0
@entity0 took charge of a first - class football team for the first time			1
the @entity11 is clearly a secondary affair for a club chasing @entity129 glory but nevertheless , given the sensibilities of the club 's status in @entity133 , it can not be ignored and the manager of the day usually takes charge			2
in that first year , @entity0 took the team and won the semi-final against @entity138 , though in a serendipitous note , the late @entity140 , whose eye @entity0 would later gouge during a @entity8 - real clash , scored for @entity138			1
@entity29 took charge for the final , which @entity8 lost but @entity0 was back in charge again in 1999 , when they lost the semi-final to @entity138			1
@entity146 ( centre ) and his team - mates appear dejected during their 2 -- 2 draw with @entity151 @entity0 celebrates @entity18 's 2 - 1 victory against @entity153 at @entity154 @entity155 ( third from left ) is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring against @entity158 the reason why @entity0 does not count the 2000 triumph as his first trophy is because , in his eyes , he was just the assistant			1
but that is not strictly true			0
there was an expectation that @entity29 would again take charge of the team for the final , as he had in 1998			2
but instead he allowed @entity0 to stay in control			2
@entity0 said : ' i took the team but he was in the stands			2
he was there to support			0
he came down at half - time to the dressing room to listen to my team talk			0
he did n't want to interfere , because probably he thought that was right			0
he did with me what i do with my assistants , give them not just responsibility , but also give them the tools for evolution , support an evolution and make them ready for a possible next step , if one day they decide to do it			0
' and though these games were not quite the star - studded first xi , there were some world - renowned stars in his team			0
when @entity0 won the cup , his team contained @entity5 , @entity198 , @entity93 and @entity199			2
and he is grateful for the opportunity : ' i accepted it as a gift for somebody that was giving everything and was working hard			0
' @entity208 ( centre ) celebrates scoring a late equaliser for @entity17 at the @entity211 on monday evening @entity0 's charisma was key to him winning over players at the time			1
' you saw it with @entity0 from the beginning , ' said @entity5			2
' though he had n't played , he was n't a big name , he had charisma towards the group			0
the things he said really communicated			0
that was the most important thing			0
he knows how to talk to people as an individual and that was the difference with him			0
everyone is different so you need to deal with them individually and he did that			0
sure , he helped me			0
' @entity41 gave @entity0 his chance but it was @entity29 who gave him his head and , in doing so , helped create the iconic manager of today			1
@entity29 always talks positively about his time with @entity0 but you can not help but wonder whether , privately , he has the odd doubt			1
@entity0 beat @entity29 at the @entity241 final and today at @entity34 his @entity18 team look much better set up than @entity29 's			1
like @entity243 , perhaps @entity29 did not quite anticipate just what he was creating			2
like our @entity17 facebook page here .			2

@entity0 worked under @entity26 at @entity8
the @entity250 expected to be sacked but became a key member of staff
he prepared opposition scouting reports for the @entity256 as his no 2
@entity29 even left @entity0 take charge of @entity8 in certain games
the pair will meet when @entity17 take on @entity18 on sunday
