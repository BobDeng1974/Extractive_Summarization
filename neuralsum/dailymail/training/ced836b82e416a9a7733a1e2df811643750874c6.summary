a @entity1 host has drawn the ire of the internet after speculating on air what could have caused the disappearance of @entity7			0
the flight from @entity9 , @entity10 to @entity11 went missing early this morning over the @entity12 , shortly after the pilot asked for a change in altitude due to severe weather			1
@entity1 co-host @entity17 interviewed former @entity19 spokesperson @entity18 about the search for the missing flight sunday morning , asking the airline industry insider whether foreign pilots were at a disadvantage since they were trained using the metric system			1
' even when we think about temperature , it 's @entity29 or @entity30 , ' @entity17 said			2
' it 's kilometers or miles			0
you know , everything about their training could be similar , but different			0
' controversial : @entity1 co-host @entity17 ( center ) sparked criticism on @entity38 for wondering whether foreign pilots ' use of the metric system could have contributed to the disappearance of @entity44 flight @entity7 while the @entity45 may provide a conversion challenge for metric users , it likely was not a problem since the vast majority of the world excluding the @entity51 uses the metric system			1
@entity18 pointed out that the bigger difference was foreign pilots ' reliance on auto - pilot , which he says they are often required to switch over to after take - off			1
this requirement is due to the fact that most crashes are due to pilot error			2
he added that he believes ' our @entity51 pilots are very well trained ' for ' situations like this ' because ' they actually fly the aircraft when they 're in the cockpit '			0
lost : an @entity44 flight from @entity10 to @entity11 went missing this morning over the @entity12			1
a search for the plane was suspended due to bad weather			2
there were 162 people on board , including 17 children but @entity17 continued to ask @entity18 if the difference in measurements were to blame , and if that makes international travel riskier			2
' it 's not just a difference in the way that we measure things ? ' @entity17 asked			1
' is it not as safe in that part of the world ? because our viewers may be thinking , " international travel , is it safe ? is it not safe ? " ' @entity18 reassured @entity17 that air travel is the safest mode of transportation in the world , and there 's nothing to fear about international travel specifically			0
this line of questioning earned kooiman some flack on @entity38 , where users critiqued her questioning the metric system 's relevance in the disappearance			0
' most all media speculation right after an air crash is ludicrous but @entity17 takes the cake , ' one user wrote .			0
