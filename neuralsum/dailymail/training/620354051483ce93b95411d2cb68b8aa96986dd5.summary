by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 3 june 2013 horse racing pundit @entity1 at @entity3 is suing @entity4 for age discrimination and they ’re off ! the two front - runners in a high - profile legal derby left the starting gate yesterday on the first leg of a £ 3million compensation dispute			1
out of the trap came flamboyant horse - racing pundit @entity1 , wind in his whiskers , sun glinting off the horse - brass round his neck			1
the trademark deerstalker hat was in place , of course , and his colours for this off - the - track event were royal blue ( his suit ) and scarlet ( his pocket handkerchief )			0
coming rapidly up the outside were representatives of @entity4 and @entity30 , whom the @entity32 presenter and former celebrity big brother contestant is suing for alleged age discrimination in what could become the latest in a series of milestone cases			2
@entity1 , 73 , claims he was sacked without explanation from @entity40 because they wanted to hire someone younger			1
the widely - known tipster maintains the decision to put him out to pasture , so to speak , was based on his age as opposed to his ability to do the job			1
@entity4 and @entity30 , which took over production of the broadcaster ’s racing coverage from the start of this year , robustly reject allegations of ageism and say they will ‘ vigorously ’ refute the claim			1
thus , in the unlikely setting of a central @entity58 employment tribunal , @entity1 sat @entity59 – or neck and neck , as an observer described it – with some of the keenest legal minds in the land			1
@entity1 is seeking £ 2.5million in punitive damages and another £ 500,000 compensation for what he calculates is a loss of future earnings , career damage , public humiliation , stress and mental anguish			1
claims : @entity1 and his wife @entity76 at @entity3 today yesterday the @entity78 - educated tipster , sporting a triple - horseshoe buckle on his belt and a selection of gold jewellery , insisted he had launched the case not just for himself , but for oldies everywhere			1
‘ i am so angry , ’ he said outside court			0
‘ i am saying i was sacked because i was old – i was 72 at the time			2
but this is a far bigger issue that just me			0
‘ there are people in their 40s , 50s , and 60s who dread that a younger person will come in and take them out of a job			2
they are in fear of it			0
‘ that is why i am claiming £ 3million in total , so that no - one will ever be sacked because they are trying to get a younger person			2
on merit and ability – fine ; but not because they are younger			2
’ the ‘ suits and skirts ’ , as he called his ex-bosses , were ‘ never answerable to anybody ’			0
he added : ‘ they make their decisions , they can destroy people ’s lives and careers , and they are never made answerable			0
now they are going to be answerable ... ’ @entity1 arrived at the tribunal with his wife @entity76 at his side , his partner for more than 40 years			1
he affectionately calls her ‘ @entity118 ’ , a reference to a gannet - like seabird , apparently			0
in contrast to her husband ’s outlandish appearance , she blended easily into the busy @entity58 street as he spoke to reporters			0
mr @entity1 was originally a racing journalist with @entity127 and also sub-editor for grandstand @entity1 is reported to have engaged lawyers on a no win no fee basis , and to have pledged part of any damages to charities fighting prejudice in the workplace			1
the @entity139 journalist made his debut as @entity4 ’s reporter in the betting ring three decades ago and went on to achieve so - called celebrity on reality tv shows , including @entity145 , in which he was partnered with ex-cabinet minister @entity146			0
his legal battle is one of a growing number of such cases to reach employment tribunals since age discrimination was added to the list of eligible claims in 2006			1
two years ago @entity156 front - woman @entity155 won a widely - publicised case against the corporation after she was replaced by younger presenters			0
former newsreader and broadcaster @entity160 reached a settlement with @entity163 over an ageism claim in 2008 , when she was 57			0
last night the @entity1 dispute still had the potential to fall at the first fence , however			2
the tribunal has yet to decide whether a full hearing should take place			0

horse racing pundit appeared at @entity3
he claims he was sacked because of his age rather than ability to do job
broadcaster *denies* @entity1 was discriminated against because of age
