@entity8 and @entity10 's title decider on saturday will clash with the @entity12 final between @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity15 and @entity16 have the broadcast rights to the @entity19 match but @entity20 will be hoping to snatch away viewers as @entity22 goes down to a winner - takes - all meeting at the @entity25			0
facing the media : @entity13 manager @entity27 speaks to the assembled press earlier this week going for glory : @entity30 takes a swing at a water bottle as @entity33 prepare for their showdown with @entity13 @entity10 have a three - point lead over second - placed @entity8 but @entity37 will become champions with a victory because of their superior head - to - head record			1
a draw and @entity10 would win their first title in 18 years and break the @entity8 - @entity45 stranglehold for the first time since 2005			1
the @entity12 final is beamed round the world and usually pulls in millions of viewers			2
traditionalists who have campaigned for the return of the 3pm saturday afternoon kick - off have been told that early evening is a ratings winner			2
battle : @entity37 vies for the ball with @entity57 in their @entity59 clash last month glory : @entity10 are bidding for their first @entity61 in 18 years when they face @entity8 on saturday leading the pack : @entity63 and his @entity13 team - mates are put through their paces on thursday unfortunately the same thinking applies in @entity68 this weekend , which means neutrals must decide between the magic of the @entity12 or the glamour of the @entity22			1
while @entity14 's progress to the final is a fairytale for the city , the club do not have a world - wide fan base which makes it less appealing on a global @entity80 's pulling power is greater as @entity27 bids to end his nine - year trophy drought			0
