by @entity0 @entity1 has been jailed for five years after returning to a life of burglary having admitted to 178 burglaries , and with a previous spell in jail for the same offence to his name , @entity1 must have been expecting another stint in prison			1
instead , the judge gave him another chance and ordered him to take part in a rehabilitation course			0
@entity1 , 24 , began in a positive fashion by starring in a crime prevention video for police , in which he advised families to keep lights on , install alarms and @entity24 and keep valuables in safes			1
but barely a month later he was ransacking people ’s homes again			0
he has now been jailed for five years for the crime spree , which netted around £ 400,000 of valuables – none of which has been recovered			0
and the @entity35 can reveal the initial reprieve was granted despite @entity1 previously receiving a 42 - month jail term for burglary , the proceeds of which paid for an @entity39 and an apartment in a luxury development where he rubbed shoulders with pop stars , actors and @entity47 footballers			1
one of his victims , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ he was n’t a drug addict who arguably could n’t help himself – he was just plain greedy			2
why did they give him the chance to offend again ? ’ @entity1 ’s life of crime began when he was 16			1
by 2007 , he was ransacking homes throughout @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
he targeted @entity61 families , believing they would be more likely to have valuable gold and jewellery			0
last september , he entered a house in @entity65 and took £ 30,000 of valuables			0
on december 16 a neighbour alerted police to a raid on a @entity71 address and @entity1 was found hiding in a wheelie bin			1
at court on april 23 , he admitted to three offences and asked for 175 more to be taken into consideration			1
judge @entity76 , @entity77 , deferred sentence and put him on the ‘ @entity79 ’ rehabilitation programme , under which he had to wear an electronic tag and obey a 9pm to 6am curfew			0
chance : judge @entity84 told @entity1 that he had wasted an opportunity to change his life when he jailed him yesterday at @entity87 but as soon as may 28 , @entity59 - born @entity1 was back to his old ways , when he and another man broke into a house in @entity91 , @entity57			1
more jewellery was taken from a house in @entity94 on june 5			0
@entity1 , of @entity91 , was arrested after his electronic tag showed he had been in both areas at the time			1
appearing at @entity87 yesterday , he admitted attempted burglary and burglary			2
he was also dealt with for the offences he admitted earlier this year			0
prosecutor @entity101 described the defendant as a ‘ burglar of considerable professionalism ’ whom other criminals paid to act as a ‘ burglary consultant ’ by identifying the best properties to target			2
@entity109 , defending , claimed her client broke into homes to prove he was n’t in league with police after other criminals saw the anti-crime video and assumed he was informing on them			2
jailing @entity1 yesterday , judge @entity76 said he had ‘ seemed to be trying ’ to leave his life of crime behind but added : ‘ your commitment was shortlived			1
’ a @entity122 spokesman yesterday defended the rehabilitation programme , saying : ‘ @entity1 was addicted to a lavish lifestyle , which is quite difficult to get away from			1
he liked living the high life			0
‘ he could n’t be helped but admitted 170 - odd offences which might never have been solved otherwise			2

' professional ' burglar @entity1 *pleaded* *guilty* to three burglaries and two attempted break - ins
asked for a further 175 burglaries to be taken into consideration
defence counsel said making police break - in videos had actually led to him *re-offending*
