by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 02:35 est , 18 july 2013 a pregnant mother who was told her rash was a harmless insect bite , passed on a virus which led to her unborn baby developing meningitis and later cerebral palsy			1
when @entity9 , 38 , from @entity10 near @entity11 , noticed itchy bumps on her abdomen and hips , she presumed they were insect bites			1
she visited her gp and obstetrician to make sure they were not signs of a more serious problem , but they too believed that she was simply exhibiting the symptoms of a nasty cluster of stings			2
it was not until her son @entity24 , now six , was born that she discovered she had caught the cold sore virus and and passed it on to her unborn baby			1
when expectant mother @entity9 , 38 , noticed itchy bumps on her stomach and thighs she and doctors presumed they were insect bites			1
it would not be until several weeks later that she would discover she had caught the cold core virus and passed it on to her unborn son , @entity31 , now six ' when i first saw the rash they looked like horsefly bites and i was just given cream for them , ' said ms @entity9 , who developed the strange blisters when she was 35 - weeks pregnant			1
' i did n't have any other symptoms			0
i suppose i felt quite tired but i was heavily pregnant and i had developed high blood pressure so it seemed natural i would n't feel great			0
' ms @entity41 , who works for @entity42 , applied ointment and carried on as normal			1
but when she gave birth by caesarian section at @entity47 in @entity11 , a seemingly unrelated health emergency occurred			0
' when @entity24 was delivered he was whisked away because he did n't take his first breath properly - he was totally silent			2
that moment felt like the longest few minutes of my life , ' she said			0
@entity24 eventually started breathing normally and his @entity59 score - a measure of a new baby 's vital statistics to work out how healthy it is - came out as being very healthy			2
but that evening @entity24 let out an unusual bloodcurdling wail			2
' i ca n't describe how shrill it was - it was like nothing i 'd heard before			0
he sounded as if he was in incredible pain and started to go blue , ' ms @entity9 said			0
ms @entity9 and her family called for help , but by the time they arrived @entity31 had returned to normal - he seemed quite happy and was bright pink again			0
ms @entity41 first noticed there was a problem when @entity24 let out a blood - curdling scream and turned blue			1
he did this several time before doctors realised he was suffering with seizures			2
it was not until later that they would find it had developed meningitis @entity24 suffered with seizures for many months after he caught the cold sore virus and developed meningitis			1
the repeated fits have left him cerebral palsy and brain damage a nurse told ms @entity9 that this was common , particularly with babies that had been delivered by c - section			1
she said that they often had mucous on their lungs and they 'd soon stop making the noise and breathe normally			0
but the shrill scream returned and soon became routine over the next few days			0
each time a doctor was a called , staff reassured the new mother that her baby was healthy - especially as he seemed fine by the time they arrived			2
it was not until @entity24 screamed while a doctor was in the room that action was taken			2
' the doctor said " is that the scream he is making each time ? " and i said it was			0
at that point he said my baby needed to be taken to intensive care , ' remembered mr @entity113			0
until recently @entity31 walked with a specially - made frame which helped to support his weight			0
he can now walk by himself but is still unable to run or jump what ms @entity9 did n't know was that the sudden shrieks were a sign of infant seizure			2
@entity24 was transferred to @entity120 where would spend the following 10 weeks			2
his health deteriorated rapidly and the number of seizures had increased			0
over the following few days he experienced between 20 and 30 seizures a day			0
as a cautionary measure he was put on a cocktail of antibiotics to kill off any infection that might be triggering the seizures , as well a number of anti-epilepsy drugs to stop the fits in the short - term			0
doctors carried out a raft of tests on newborn @entity24 , but results kept coming back normal			1
eventually they carried out a lumbar puncture which showed that he had traces of the @entity143 virus - or cold sore virus - in his body			1
despite his ongoing health problems , @entity24 loves school ( pictured in his uniform )			2
his mother said that his favourite thing to do when at home is to watch people sing - particularly on the x factor , @entity152 or on @entity153 ms @entity9 said : ' i was totally shocked			2
how could a newborn have caught the cold sore virus within hours of birth ? not only that , but i 'd never had a cold sore in my life			1
' but the doctor 's diagnosis prompted ms @entity9 to remember the strange rash that had developed several weeks previously			0
doctors then concluded that the small red blisters that had spread across the lower half of ms @entity9 's body was almost certainly a rare manifestation of the virus			1
@entity24 is pictured here with his scaffolder father @entity170 , 34			0
doctors said the chances of mother @entity9 passing on the virus to her unborn son @entity24 were just one in 100,000 the doctors explained that ms @entity41 must have caught the infection for the first time during her pregnancy and it must have manifested itself in the strange rash			1
they explained that there was a one in 100,000 chance that she could have passed the virus on to her son			0
this had in turn caused him to develop meningoencephalitis - a swelling on the parts of the brain called the meninges and the cephalus			0
it is thought that this swelling or the initial infection that damaged @entity24 ' brain and caused him to develop cerebral palsy			1
cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain , which normally occurs before , during or soon after birth			1
causes of cerebral palsy include infection in early pregnancy , a difficult or premature birth , bleeding in the baby â€™s brain and abnormal brain development			1
children with cerebral palsy often have other related conditions including epilepsy , learning difficulties and sensory problems such as blindness			2
ms @entity41 said son @entity24 is a very happy boy but that he exhibits slightly obsessive tendencies			1
he is particularly fond of his school 's headteacher , mr @entity216 , who he likes because he uses a megaphone at playtime @entity24 was put on a strong dose of acyclovir - the active compound in many over the counter cold sore remedies - to fight the infection			1
soon after his diagnosis , doctors discovered that @entity24 had also developed cerebral palsy when he was unable to clench his fist			1
since then @entity24 has made slow but steady progress			0
he has managed to hit his milestones although he did n't crawl until he was 18 - months - old and he did n't learn to walk until he was three			0
but he is happy , ms @entity9 said : ' he 's never going to be like other kids his age but he 's such a cheerful child and that 's all that matters			0
' one charity that has made life much easier for ms @entity41 is @entity239 , a charity that specialises in helping children with disabilities and developmental delays			1
' i do n't know what i 'd have done if i did n't access to them , said ms @entity41			1
' they are so supportive and helped make feel like i know i 'm moving in the right direction with @entity24			0

ms @entity41 , 38 , developed small blisters in the late stages of pregnancy
she and doctors believed that they were harmless insect bites as there were no other symptoms accompanying the itchy bumps on her hips
but as soon as baby @entity24 , now 6 , was born he suffered seizures
raft of tests eventually showed he had contracted the @entity266 cold sore virus from his mother which had caused him to develop meningitis
rare *complication* has left @entity24 with cerebral palsy but he is *thriving* at school and is now able to walk without the help of a frame
