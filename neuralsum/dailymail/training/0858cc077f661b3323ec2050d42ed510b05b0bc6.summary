a thatched roof is normally made out of straw , rushes or heather , but when inland vegetation was nowhere to be found , the @entity15 team behind the eco-home turned to a nearby lake			1
in the weeds : over eight tons of eelgrass seaweed was harvested to cover the roof and walls of the house , located on a @entity15 island must sea : the roof of the eco-friendly house , as well as some of the walls , is made out of seaweed the seaweed is harvested , washed and dried before it is packed into bales and used to build walls and cover the roof this specific type of seaweed , called eelgrass , is harvested from the water with an excavator and left on the nearby marsh to be washed by rain			1
once washed , the seaweed is left to dry in the sunshine before being pressed into round bales , just like hay			2
@entity42 , a @entity43 architect , designed the unique house that is located on the @entity46 island in @entity15			1
' the objective was to demonstrate how a natural resource like seaweed can be integrated in contemporary construction , ' the 52 - year - old said			2
‘ the idea was to re-introduce overlooked or disregarded organic materials to a modern industrialised technology at a time where low - carbon solutions are much called for			0
’ in order to build the roof on the eco-home , a staggering eight tons of seaweed had to be collected from the nearby water before it was prepared and stacked 3ft 3in high in order to keep the rain out			1
the one - of - a - kind home took four months to construct and is now expected to fetch around £ 350,000			0
