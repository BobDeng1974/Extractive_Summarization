divorce can be a turbulent time , so why not do it in extreme comfort ? that 's the big sell behind @entity4 , a luxury resort in @entity7 's , latest venture			1
previously renowned for putting on lavish weddings the hotel and spa has turned it 's attention to quick splits with $ 5,000 ( £ 3,000 ) weekend divorce packages			1
for that amount you and your soon - to - be ex husband can make a weekend of it with access to the baths and spa , tennis , hiking , swimming , golf courses and ice skating , in between trips to your attorney			1
excess baggage ? @entity4 and @entity29 in @entity30 in @entity7 will take care of it sound like a nice way to break - up ? the ' @entity35 ' has only two criteria : you must be a @entity37 citizen and agree to use the attorneys and mediators provided by the hotel			1
a jolly on the golf course this ai n't - you have to be fully committed to your forthcoming divorce			2
over the weekend guests work with mediators to finalise the sticky details into a signed agreement and , if they choose , the whole process can be filmed as part of a new reality show made by @entity51 , the production company behind @entity54 ’s ' @entity53 '			1
visit the hotel 's @entity55 for sanctuary from your other half before you make the break program founder @entity60 told the @entity61 , ' practically , they are divorced after signing on sunday			0
' ' after signing , all work is done and we send it to a judge who only puts a stamp on it to make it official			0
' @entity60 , who already runs similar projects in his native @entity70 , expects to start up his services at the end of september			0
@entity73 , a hotel representative , stated , ' they want people to get into an environment that minimizes the stress of the situation and that 's exactly what we offer			0
' couples check into separate rooms and use a shared suite for ' mediation ' talks he added , ' we welcome all kinds of guests			2
' problems could arise when weddings and divorces are held at the same time but @entity73 says the hotel will keep the milestones separate			0
' we would be sensitive to having them in different parts of the hotel , ' he said .			0
