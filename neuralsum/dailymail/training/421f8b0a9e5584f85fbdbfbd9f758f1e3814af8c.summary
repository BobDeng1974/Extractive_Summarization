by @entity1 reporter published : 14:13 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 14:13 est , 12 november 2013 just when you thought parking inspectors were the most - hated profession around , in come the ' odor investigators '			0
pot smokers in @entity7 , @entity8 - where the limited sale , possession and growth of recreational marijuana is legal - have had their noses put out of joint recently by @entity16 agents dubbed the ' @entity17 ' , whose job is to sniff them out			1
@entity20 of environmental health officer @entity21 uses his ' smellescrope ' - proper name @entity25 - to detect marijuana odor and then investigate whether the law has been broken based on the strength of the smell			1
@entity21 acts on complaints that are filed by people who report strong smells of the drug			2
complaints about pot smells doubled in @entity7 from 2010 to 2012			1
take a big wiff : ' @entity37 ' have become an increased presence in @entity7 since the decriminalization of recreational marijuana , which has seen complaints of ' pot smells ' double but backers of @entity45 - the monumental @entity8 bill that legalized the use of marijuana in the state - say it is unconstitutional			1
@entity21 , who has been investigating odor complaints ( not restricted to marijuana ) for 26 years , told @entity51 that his job is primarily to call out businesses that grow marijuana and are affecting neighbors and passers - by with the plant 's stench			1
his job , he says , is not to track down smokers enjoying legal weed in the privacy of their homes			1
according to the @entity63 , the odor has to reach a level of 8:1 in order to receive a fine of $ 2000			0
such a violation has not been reported since 1994			0
' it has to be a very strong odor , ' @entity21 said			0
field of grass : the primary focus of ' @entity37 ' is to use their smellescope to find growth plants , such as this one , and determine if any laws have been broken the @entity77 is a portable odor detecting and measuring instrument that can quantify odor strength in ambient air , according to device developers @entity83			1
they cost about $ 1,500 and are used to detect the strength of other smells also , such a wood fire pizza shop that is creating too much smoke			0
a major issue in @entity7 at the moment is a proposal to make the very smell of marijuana a public crime			1
the city council have considered a ban to stop the odor drifting over fences into neighbors homes or being smelt in popular areas , such as the @entity100			0
' odor can be subject ' said @entity102 , council president			0
' it 's hard to legislate odor			0
' the strength that is required to register on the @entity77 is something we need to look at			0
' i also wonder if people will get used to the smell ( now it 's legal ) and the dislike of it now may change over time			2
' the first recreational marijuana shops are expected to open in @entity8 on jan. 1 , 2014			2
while it means weed will be available in the retail sphere , the law will still only permit it to be smoked in private @entity120 states that adults can possess up to an ounce of pot , can grow as many as six marijuana plants at home ( with only three flowering at any given time ) , but home - grown marijuana can only be for personal use and can not be sold			1
however , adults can gift one another up to an ounce of pot. the first recreational marijuana shops are expected to open on jan. 1 , 2014			0
another spike in complaints of the smell of marijuana is expected around that time .			2

@entity8 has seen a rise in ' @entity37 ' ever since *voters* legalized marijuana last november
the passing of @entity45 meant investigating ' pot smells ' was no *longer* a police matter but one for the @entity146
the officers use a ' nasal *ranger* ' device , which straps onto their nose , to determine if a smell is beyond the *acceptable* legal *parameters*
the @entity37 say there job is to *locate* pot growers breaking the law and not bust people smoking in the privacy of their home
@entity7 council *continues* to debate making the smell of marijuana a public crime
