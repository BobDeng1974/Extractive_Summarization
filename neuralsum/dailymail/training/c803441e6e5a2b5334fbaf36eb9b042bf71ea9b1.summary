a debt - ridden @entity1 man proved to be unlucky in love after trying to sell his virginity for £ 700 - and failing to receive a single offer			1
@entity6 was left baffled by the lack of interest having described himself in a local newspaper as ' @entity10 , toned and dark - haired '			1
the 29 - year - old virgin conceded that he was ' no @entity12 ' after his money - making plan flopped - but expressed surprise that nobody wanted to ' try out ' his ' great body '			1
@entity17 : @entity6 was left baffled by the lack of interest having described himself in a local newspaper as ' @entity10 , toned and dark - haired ' mr @entity6 had announced his intentions to sell his virginity to any takers in @entity23 , a city in central @entity1 - making it clear that transport was ' not included '			1
keen to secure an early sale , he did not specify whether buyers should be male or female			0
he wrote : ' man , 29 , @entity23			2
athletic and toned , dark haired			1
i 'm selling my virginity			2
' but weeks after placing the advert , aimed at clearing mounting debts , mr @entity6 was still no closer to abandoning his virtue - and had not had even one response from a potential buyer			1
he said : ' i do n't understand it			0
i 'm a good looking guy with a good physique			2
i thought someone might even offer me more			0
disappointed : the 29 - year - old virgin conceded that he was ' no @entity12 ' after his money - making plan flopped - but expressed surprise that nobody wanted to ' try out ' his ' great body ' ' i 'm healthy , i 'm no @entity12 but i 'm not ugly either			1
i forgot to specify male or female in the ad and i did n't even get any gay takers			0
' it does n't do much for your self - esteem to be rejected by absolutely everybody in the world			0
' @entity6 took out the ad to pay off debts he has run up through unemployment and having to care for his diabetic brother			2
he said : ' i 've worked hard in the fields and in farms all my life			0
it 's tough work but it has given me a great body			0
i thought people would be keen to try it out			0
