@entity2 may stop making its super-jumbo , the @entity4 , because sales figures have been so poor , the company 's finance director revealed			1
making its first commercial flight in 2007 to great fanfare , the @entity4 is the world 's largest and most glamorous passenger airliner , with two decks that run the entire length of the fuselage			1
the @entity4 has entered service in the fleets of several major airlines , including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , but the future of the plane was thrown into doubt amid a slump in orders			1
the unusually frank remark reflected an internal debate over the future of the world 's largest airliner but is the first time @entity2 has publicly contemplated winding down the project , according to @entity40			1
it 's one of several scenarios that it 's contemplating , the agency said			0
others include slowing production or investing together with @entity47 in an improved engine			0
the only new @entity4 customer @entity2 has managed to win this year is lease firm @entity52 shares in @entity2 suffered their worst drubbing in more than six years on wednesday after the planemaker predicted flat profits in 2016			1
industry sources said it is in talks to try to shift a handful of planes no longer destined for @entity62 's troubled @entity61 to larger @entity62 carrier @entity63			0
@entity2 said it would not comment on specific discussions			1
at the moment @entity2 has 318 firm orders for the aircraft lined up , with 147 having been delivered			1
the biggest customer is @entity16 , which is flying 55 @entity68 , with another 85 additions to the fleet planned , according to @entity71			0
the site 's managing editor , @entity72 , told @entity74 that @entity2 is facing several issues , including the limit to how many carriers can afford them			1
he said : ' the @entity79 and @entity80 are coming close to the @entity4 in unit costs so there is little incentive to buy a larger aircraft from the cost perspective			2
airlines also shy away from the risk of having to fill another 150 seats per flight			0
excess capacity by definition leads to lower fares and often to below - cost fares which airlines obviously seek to avoid			2
' the @entity4 was launched in 2000 and planned in the late 1990s so it is one generation older than the new aircraft			1
it has four engines , which makes it more expensive to operate and maintain			0
' @entity99 has become so dominant that a good part of the @entity103 - @entity102 market is shifting via @entity104 so there is less left for the rest - smaller aircraft are sufficient			2
' finally , it 's a huge investment that not many can afford and there 's only a limited number of routes that are big enough to justify the aircraft - unless you happen to be @entity99 with a huge number of connecting passengers			2
' the head of @entity104 - based @entity99 reacted angrily to the suggestion that @entity2 might stop making the @entity4 , which took 15 years to develop at a cost of $ 25billion			1
@entity118 told @entity40 it could double its investment if the planemaker agreed to upgrade the @entity4 instead			2
the @entity4 has entered service in the fleets of several major airlines , including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 cost : Â£ 270million ( $ 400m ) length : 72.7m ( 238 feet 8 inches ) @entity125 : 79.8m ( 261 feet 10 inches ) height : 24.1m ( 79 feet ) top speed : 587mph seats : 469 seats ( @entity130 , 97 business , 55 premium economy , 303 economy ) range : 9,755 miles @entity136 take - off weight : 560 tonnes pilots : two to four ( depending on length of flight ) cabin crew : 22 number in @entity18 fleet : first of 12 on order ( three arrive this year and five more in 2014 )			1
legroom : - 31 inches in economy - 38 inches in premium economy - 6ft long bed in business class ( @entity18 ) - 6ft 6 inch long bed in @entity148 manufacturer : @entity2 , @entity150 : four @entity152 900 engines built in @entity153			1
wings : built at @entity2 factory in @entity156 , @entity157			2
' i am not particularly happy as you can imagine , ' @entity118 said			0
' we are on the hook for this plane			0
i get pretty miffed when we have put so much at stake			0
' @entity118 said that if @entity47 and @entity2 went ahead with upgrading the engines on the @entity99 would eventually replace all the 140 superjumbos it has ordered with the newly upgraded version , as fuel consumption would be lowered by 12 to 15 per cent from 2020			2
but he suggested @entity99 would hold @entity2 to delivering the @entity68 it has sold if it decides to halt the programme			0
@entity2 would in that case probably ask @entity99 to forego some of its future deliveries , he said , adding , ' that is not a conversation i would like to have '			0
@entity118 said he was worried about the effect @entity2 's sombre message would have on future @entity4 purchases by other airlines , as well as the supply chain and the @entity103 aerospace industry which has been a darling of politicians by creating jobs			1
he also said the stance would not help the future second - hand value of @entity4 aircraft			1
@entity118 called on @entity2 to step up its @entity4 marketing efforts , saying it was flying ' full to the gunwales ' and making good profits if configured correctly			1
the aircraft was designed to help airlines cope with airport congestion			0
' this is where @entity2 needs to be going , to persuade airlines in the long haul business that this definitely has a place , ' he said			2
@entity2 immediately sought to defuse the row			0
' the entire @entity2 top management continues to believe strongly in the market prospects of the @entity4 , but any investment by @entity2 requires a sound business case , which we will continue to study , ' head of corporate communications @entity198 said			1
however , @entity118 raised broader questions about @entity2 's strategy for wide - body jets , citing poor sales of the smallest type of @entity79 and its replacement by an upgraded version of the older @entity213			1
@entity2 says this has extended a successful product			0
' what is happening over there ? i would like a first - hand understanding on where they are going , ' @entity118 said , suggesting that @entity2 risked being over-dependent on its smaller @entity222			2
the sweeping criticism from one of the airline industry 's most influential figures will ring further alarm bells in @entity228 , after @entity16 recently cancelled an order for @entity230			0
however @entity118 ruled out a broader decline in the relationship and said @entity99 would soon consider making an order for 50 - 70 mid-sized @entity2 or @entity235 wide - body jets			2
he said @entity16 wanted to look at in - service performance data on the @entity79 before deciding whether to place a new order			0
in january 2012 @entity239 aircraft engineers called for @entity68 to be grounded , after @entity17 and @entity19 found cracks in the wings of their super-jumbos			0
both airlines , and @entity2 , admitted that they had discovered cracks , but maintained that the aircraft were safe			1
luxury : a passenger relaxes on a @entity4			0
because of their size , the aircraft can be configured with very spacious seating			0
