police have arrested three suspected members of @entity2 in @entity3 who had amassed enough explosives to blow up a bus			1
the trio - two of whom had practiced flying light aircraft - may have been plotting attacks in @entity3 or elsewhere in @entity10 according to @entity3 's interior minister			1
the three - a @entity12 , a @entity12 of @entity14 descent , and a @entity15 , were arrested after being watched by @entity17 authorities for ' some time '			1
in custody : three unnamed suspected members of @entity2 , pictured , have been arrested in @entity3 police operation : vehicles and personnel from the @entity17 police are seen outside an apartment at @entity26 district in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity3 pictures of the suspects were released by @entity17 authorities but they were identified only by their initials : @entity32 for the @entity15 and @entity33 and @entity34 for the other two			1
the mug shots showed three men who appeared to be in their 30s , two with crew cuts and one with hair down to his shoulders			2
the @entity15 was arrested in the southern city of @entity27 bordering the @entity43 colony of @entity44 , while the other two were picked up near the central city of @entity46 as they traveled toward a northern @entity17 town near the border with @entity50			2
@entity17 minister of interior @entity51 , pictured , said enough explosives were found to blow up a bus enough explosive material was found in the house in @entity27 where the @entity15 lived to blow up a bus , interior minister @entity51 said			0
he added that investigators found no indications that the three were targeting @entity44 but added that ' there are clear indications they could have been planning an attack in @entity3 and / or another country '			1
he continued : ' this is one of the most important operations carried out against @entity2 ' before calling one of those arrested as a ' very important member '			0
he said the operation involved close collaboration with intelligence services from ' @entity3 's allies ' without identifying any of the countries			1
the arrests came as the @entity76 were being held in @entity43 under tight security against possible terrorist attacks , including military aircraft and ground - to - air missiles			1
@entity17 authorities had been watching the suspects for ' some time ' and the minister added the decision to arrest them was made after the @entity12 and the @entity12 of @entity14 descent took a bus towards @entity50			1
the two arrested in the bus were traveling from southern @entity28 to the northern town of @entity90 , possibly intending to cross into @entity50 , the minister said			0
the pair had been in @entity3 for about two months			1
@entity28 is near the large @entity93 military base in @entity94 alongside the @entity95			0
' police moved to arrest them when it became known that they planned to leave @entity3 ' he said			2
@entity51 did not disclose the suspects ' names , but said two were suspected @entity2 operatives while the @entity15 was a facilitator			0
lethal : police found enough explosives to blow up a bus at the property in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity3 @entity109 : it is not known if the trio were attempting to target the @entity76 in @entity112 the minister described one operative as a key member of the terror network and said both operatives had practiced flying in light aircraft			1
one was also an expert in explosives and poisonous substances , said @entity51			0
@entity17 police have arrested dozens of @entity2 suspects since the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks in the @entity93 , and more after the 2004 train bombings in @entity126			2
most @entity128 - based terror arrests in @entity3 over the last several years have been of lower - level players and people trying to recruit jihadists , but the detention of the @entity12 and the @entity15 was significant because of their apparent high level of training and capability , said @entity136 , a terror expert at the @entity137			1
on alert : police have arrested dozens of @entity2 suspects following the @entity126 train bombings captured in @entity142 footage above ' what jumps out is that they have had aircraft training , ' he said			0
' it 's always a worry that someone could get a hold of a private plane and try to do a ( terror ) operation against an event , ' @entity136 said			2
but getting to @entity43 during the @entity76 probably would have been a challenge for the three , even if they had not been under surveillance			0
passport - free ground travel in much of the 27 - nation @entity159 meant they could have gone to countries on the continent without facing document checks , but getting to @entity43 is more difficult because passport checks for visitors are mandatory			2
@entity43 ' has the tougher border control			0
they are almost like the @entity93 in some sense			0
they triple check your name in databases , ' @entity136 said			0
the three will appear soon before an investigating magistrate at the @entity175 in @entity126 and remain under detention while a judge studies the case and decides on possible charges .			0

authorities had been watching the three men - none of whom have been named - for some time
the trio may have been plotting terror attacks in @entity3 or elsewhere in @entity10
