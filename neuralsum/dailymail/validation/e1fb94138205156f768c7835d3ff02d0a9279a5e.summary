@entity2 hospitals are becoming ‘ dangerously ’ overcrowded and staff do not have enough time to clean - up between patients , experts warn			1
some wards are more than 95 per cent full - well over the 85 per cent considered safe – placing patients at far higher risk of infections and neglect			1
a report by the @entity12 today also warns that standards across the @entity2 including hitting waiting times and financial targets have slipped for the first time in 20 years			1
@entity2 hospitals are becoming ‘ dangerously ’ overcrowded and targets for waiting times are slipping , experts warn the think - tank predicts there is a ‘ real risk ’ patient care will worsen next year because the health service is running out of money			1
its experts are particularly concerned that many hospitals are becoming so overcrowded their wards are unsafe			1
figures show that the average @entity2 hospital is 90 per cent full but in the last three months to december almost a fifth were more than 95 per cent occupied			1
this is partly because many hospitals have lost beds and closed wards as part of a long - term drive to treat more patients at home			2
@entity40 , chief economist at the @entity12 , called the report ' worrying ' the numbers of beds has halved in 26 years from around 300,000 in 1987/8 to 150,000 last year			2
but over that time , the numbers of frail patients being admitted to hospital from @entity47 has increased and they are being packed onto crowded wards where there is a high turnover			0
@entity40 , chief economist at the @entity12 said : ‘ that is very worrying			2
’ ‘ there is clearly pressure in the system to use beds more intensively as the money is tighter , but patients keep turning up at the front door			2
‘ if they are used too intensively you have n’t got time to clean up between patients			0
‘ the pressure is building and bubbling out in terms of bed occupancy levels which are getting dangerously high			2
’ ‘ there are potential dangers with infections and not having enough time to clean beds			2
’ the report also warns that targets for waiting times in @entity47 , cancer treatment and other operations and procedures have been repeatedly missed over the last year			1
and it predicts the waits may well get even longer next year as hospitals just do not have enough money to ensure patients are treated promptly			0
the @entity2 will have overspent its budget by more than £ 800 million by the end of this financial year and half of hospitals will be in the red			1
mr @entity40 added : ‘ the next government will inherit a health service that has run out of money and is operating at the very edge of its limits			0
‘ while the @entity2 has performed well in the face of huge challenges , there is now a real risk that patient care will deteriorate as service and financial pressures become overwhelming			1
@entity99 mp , @entity100 's @entity99 , said the report was proof that @entity102 had ‘ broken ’ his promise to protect the @entity2 ‘ our assessment is it 's going to be very difficult indeed next year			1
‘ my speculation would be that once the system is under pressure financially next year as well , we 're going to see some real problems with waiting times and that 's going to have to be addressed , and patients will really feel that			1
@entity99 mp , @entity100 's @entity99 , said the report was proof that @entity102 had ‘ broken ’ his promise to protect the @entity2			1
‘ what this report reveals , is that he is on course to create a large deficit in the @entity2			1
‘ hospitals are now trapped in a financial vicious circle with bills for agency staff running out of control and staff failing to keep pace with demand			1
’ @entity127 , 74 died last year after waiting five hours for an ambulance only to be misdiagnosed at hospital @entity130 , 95 , died after waiting four hours in a queue of ambulances at @entity133 , @entity134			2
a coroners hearing was told miss @entity130 ’s cleaner dialled 999 on september 1 last year when she found her on the floor after a fall			0
she had a cut on her head but was still conscious			0
paramedics arrived soon after and she was transported to hospital in an ambulance two hours later			0
but coroner @entity143 said , there was evidence to suggest 11 ambulances were queuing outside @entity47 waiting to discharge patients			0
‘ over the course of the next few hours she began to decline and paramedics were becoming concerned at the delay in admission , ’ he said			0
by the time she was finally admitted to the @entity157 hospital , four hours later , her family said it was too late			0
a post-mortem examination found she died of pneumonia due to bleeding on the brain , caused by the head injury			0
the coroner also referred to the death of @entity127 , 73			0
in march 2014 , retired engineer mr @entity127 called an ambulance after suffering internal bleeding			0
but it was five hours before he was admitted to hospital where he was then misdiagnosed			0
he died the following day .			0

@entity12 warned waiting times and financial targets have also slipped
