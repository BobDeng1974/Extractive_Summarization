former defence secretary dr @entity7 claims @entity3 would be appalled by conservatives defecting to the @entity6 @entity5 the @entity24 flagbearer spoke out after @entity5 leader @entity25 claimed earlier this week that if @entity3 were entering politics today she would join his party			1
dr @entity7 said : ‘ @entity3 used to say that she was born a @entity17 , would die a @entity17 and would fight for her beliefs inside the @entity17			2
‘ i think she would be disappointed , if not appalled , to see conservatives switching to @entity5 rather than argue their case inside the @entity17			2
‘ but worse , she would be horrified to think that such switching could open the door to power locally and nationally to her mortal enemy , the @entity13			0
’ dr @entity7 spoke out as @entity5 faced embarrassment as it was revealed that one of its local election candidates was a member of the far - right @entity39 and another blamed @entity40 for the @entity41			1
@entity5 candidate @entity42 is alleged to have said @entity43 was engineered by @entity44 and bankers to create the state of @entity47 @entity42 the @entity5 candidate in @entity49 , @entity50 , was suspended after it was revealed that she has claimed the @entity43 was financed by @entity40 bankers to help create the state of @entity47			1
she said : ‘ it was thanks to them that six million @entity40 were murdered in the war ’			0
@entity42 also encouraged followers to read the @entity58 , a forged anti-semitic hoax that claims the world is run by a worldwide @entity40 conspiracy			2
@entity61 , from @entity62 in @entity63 , was earlier thrown out of the party when it emerged she was in the @entity39			1
mr @entity25 yesterday admitted that ‘ one or two ’ of his party ’s candidates in the local elections could be members of the @entity39 or have criminal records and conceded that candidates that he would ‘ rather not have had ’ standing in the elections may have ‘ slipped through the net ’			1
dr @entity7 used a speech to business leaders in @entity77 to argue the @entity17 party can win an overall majority in 2015 provided it shows ‘ political courage ’ and ‘ intellectual creativity ’			2
but he warned the @entity17 had lost touch with many of the people who had voted for @entity3			2
‘ many people in this country will also have been reminded why they were drawn to the @entity17 cause under @entity3 's leadership , ’ he will said			2
‘ their values have not changed and neither have ours but we are currently lacking the language to reconnect with them			0
we are their natural home and they are our natural supporters regardless of what background or part of the country they come			0
’ although he does not directly criticise @entity100 , his speech will be seen as offering the party a radical alternative vision for the next election			0
despite the reforms of the coalition , he said the country remained ‘ over-taxed , over-regulated ’ and still spent too much and borrowed too much			0
the conservatives now need to come forward with a programme which rewarded risk - takers and fostered a climate where wealth creation was encouraged			0
he calls for a public spending freeze for at least three years , and a ‘ systematic switching ’ of universal benefits into tax cuts			0

‘ we must end the iniquitous multi-taxing of the same money , ’ dr @entity7 added			0

’ @entity42 pictured left with @entity5 leader @entity25 at a rally in @entity141 , @entity142			1
mr @entity25 admitted that not all candidates have been properly vetted to ensure they do not hold extreme views assets sales he suggests could include @entity146 , @entity147 , and the @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 water industries , as well as the government 's stakes in @entity154 and @entity155			1
there should also be a rethink of the size and structure of @entity160 and the @entity161 , as well as a radical programme of deregulation			0
‘ i believe it is entirely possible for the conservative party to win an overall majority at the next general election if we show political courage , intellectual creativity and party unity , ’ he added ‘ those of us who were drawn to the @entity17 by @entity3 's desire to free people from the pigeon holes that they had historically been put into , able to exploit their own talents in a country that valued opportunity , creativity and hard work , have a duty to make that message heard in the next generation as well			1
’ in an apparent side - swipe at mr @entity100 's @entity187 background , he emphasised @entity3 's appeal across the class divide , saying that , as the grandson of a miner , it was ‘ unimaginable ’ that he could have been attracted to the party before she became leader			1
