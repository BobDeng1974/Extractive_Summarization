animal protection activists are planning to become ' human shields ' for a wild boar population which they say is facing the biggest government cull in its history			1
campaigners in @entity7 claim the @entity8 wants to kill up to 500 of the animals using four trained marksmen , after numbers allegedly leaped from 535 to 819 in just one year			1
but they insist no one knows exactly how many boar live in the wild - and other government figures estimate there are fewer than 1,000 in the whole of @entity17			1
@entity18 : government marksmen will descend in the next few weeks on the @entity7 , where a population of wild boar ( pictured ) has been living for several years			1
activists are planning to sabotage the cull idyllic : but campaigner @entity25 , who plans to sabotage the cull , admitted boar were ' a @entity28 animal '			1
he added : ' people either love them or hate them - and when they hate them , they really hate them ' ( file photo ) that means the @entity38 forest could lose its entire population or the remaining boar could become inbred and diseased , the activists claim			1
wild boar were extinct in @entity17 for around 300 years , but reappeared in the @entity7 in the 1990s after a herd escaped			1
more were later released into the wild and there are also herds in @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			2
they divide residents , some of whom welcome their return while others raise safety fears and complain their gardens have been turned upside down			2
@entity58 will descend on the historic forest in the next few weeks and could remain until the breeding season begins next spring			2
the culls have happened most years since boar were reintroduced into the forest , but campaigners say this year 's actions are going further than ever before			1
spread : there are established wild boar populations in four locations in the south , according to @entity17 a forestry commission ' census ' claims the boar population in the @entity7 has soared to 819 , a huge increase from the 535 recorded last year			1
but 46 - year - old @entity25 , one of 30 activists living in the forest who are preparing to sabotage the marksmen , said there was huge doubt over the figures			1
mr @entity25 has been to district council meetings where he claims the number of boar to be culled has been put as high as 500			1
that is despite figures by @entity17 , another government agency , suggesting there are ' probably ' no more than 500 boar in the three main established populations in @entity17 and certainly fewer than 1,000			1
he said : ' it sounds incredibly heroic , standing between them and the guns , but these guys are trained marksmen and they ca n't shoot us			1
we just stand there and they ca n't do anything			0
' there are only four marksmen and we know what they look like , so we do n't need fancy tracking devices			2
we 've got a lot of supporters in the forest who ring us and tell us where they are			0
' and in a stroke of absolute genius they 've picked september which is the same time as the badger cull			0
that means there are likely to be more activists around who support our cause			0
' beauty spot : @entity115 became a common sight in the @entity38 forest in the 1990s after a long absence wild boar are the ancestors of modern - day farming pigs , which began being domesticated thousands of years ago			1
feasting on roots , fruits and nuts along with small animals , they can grow up to 7ft long from head to tail tip and weigh up to 200kg			0
females and youngsters form herds of up to 50 which stay safe in the wild with thick bristly bodies and large tusks , while males often roam solo looking for a mate			0
the animals reach sexual maturity at around 18 months and live for 15 to 20 years , sleeping in dens in the forest			1
although they shy away from human contact , they often wallow for hours in mud baths to remove parasites and are most active at dawn and dusk when they forage for food			0
source : @entity151 for the environment the pledge puts the activists on the warpath with forest officials , despite them insisting they will only use legal means			2
deputy surveyor @entity158 recently claimed some activists had launched ' psychological intimidation ' against his staff with a ' threat of physical attacks '			0
it is believed hostile comments began gathering online under a photograph which had been circulated of one of the marksmen cradling a gun			0
mr @entity25 said the photograph was deleted when the comments emerged			0
the boar , meanwhile , have come into conflict with dogs , with council bosses saying a number of pets have been ' seriously injured ' and advising owners to keep dogs on a short lead			2
residents are also told not to leave out food for the boar and to avoid walking through dense undergrowth where they might encounter them at close quarters			0
mr @entity25 dismissed many safety concerns about the animals , saying neighbours who objected to them were mostly worried about their gardens being dug up			2
' they 're a @entity28 animal ' , he said			0
' people either love them or hate them - and when they hate them , they really hate them			0
' i 've never heard of anyone saying " they 're going to attack a child in the end " - it 's always " have you seen what they did to the verges , they dug up so - and - so 's garden or field "			0
' at the end of the day this is a forest			0
if people want to live in a garden they should go to suburbia			1
' forest of @entity7 resident @entity217 , 36 , who runs the campaign group @entity218 with animals , added forestry bosses should be using non-lethal methods like contraception			1
' there are claims that we have 800 or 900 boar but if you speak to anybody who walks in the forest they 're seeing fewer and fewer , ' he said			2
majesty : the animals were extinct in @entity17 for around 300 years but have been reintroduced in forest areas			1
they also thrive in parts of @entity236 including the @entity237 in @entity238 ( pictured ) ' there are a couple of years where they 've had to suspend the cull because they over-culled the year before , which shows the danger we 're looking at			1
' a couple of the boar have got into people 's gardens - yeah , it 's not nice , but i 'm not sure that it warrants a mass slaughter			1
' if you live in a forest you should expect wildlife and you 've had ten years to put up a fence			1
' there are three well - established feral boar populations in the country , according to the government body @entity17			0
the largest , in the woodlands of @entity46 and @entity47 , was estimated in 2004 at having around 200 animals			0
the @entity7 and @entity263 on @entity265 area was the second - largest while west @entity48 had fewer than 50			0
there are also thought to be around 50 on the fringes of @entity268 , @entity49 , after escapes and releases between 2005 and 2007			0
despite the resurgence @entity17 says there are ' probably no more than around 500 in the established populations , and almost certainly fewer than 1000 in total '			0
the cull is supported by the @entity275			0
a spokesman said : ' as a council we acknowledge that this is an issue of much community interest			0
' at a @entity278 meeting in february , the democratically elected members debated and agreed for the @entity278 to support the @entity8 in adopting effective management methods			2
' adorable : wild boar piglets in the @entity7 - but the adult animals can come into conflict with dogs but mr @entity217 said : ' boars are very good for the forest because they constantly turn the earth which allows wildflowers to grow			1
' i think it 's brilliant that they 're back			0
they 're the truest wild boars you 'll find anywhere in @entity236 and people come from all around the @entity300 and pay a lot of money to try and spot one			2
' a @entity8 spokesman told @entity306 figures for the 2014/15 cull have not yet been confirmed , but 135 were culled last season			1
on the alleged ' threats ' , she said : ' @entity310 are aware of the threats made to @entity8 staff and we will not be commenting further on this			2
' she added : ' wildlife rangers will work around individuals , always ensuring safety considerations are the highest priority			0
