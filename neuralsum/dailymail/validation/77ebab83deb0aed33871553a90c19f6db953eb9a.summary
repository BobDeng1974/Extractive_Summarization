this is the excruciating moment a woman appears to snap a bone in her leg while using gym equipment			1
the unidentified woman cries in pain as her bone apparently snaps , moments after she lifts a heavy weight using a leg press			1
a leg press is a machine used in strength or resistance training			1
it requires a person to push weight away therefore engaging their leg muscles			1
but when the woman she is halfway through her second repetition , having already lifted the weight , she relaxes her leg while it is extended , rather than keeping her knee bent to support the weight			1
the unidentified woman screams in agony as her leg bone snaps			1
she was using a leg press machine at the gym , in which she was pushing away weights with her leg muscles but the weight is too heavy and bears down on her leg , forcing it to bend the wrong way			1
the force causes a painful injury to her leg			2
while the woman writhes in agony , a man standing nearby in a suit watching her workout rushes to help			1
while it is unclear what exactly injury she sustained , an expert told @entity47 she could have fractured the tibia ( the bone between the knee and ankle ) or the femur ( bone that extends from the pelvis to the knee )			1
it is also possible she sustained an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament , the strongest ligament in the knee			0
@entity61 , a chartered physiotherapist said : ‘ on the second repetition , her leg went into hyperextension , which means the ligaments go beyond themselves and the knee has bent back on itself			2
‘ she could have torn her posterior cruciate ligament , ' she said			0
' the ligament prevents the knee joint from what physios call " posterior instability "			0
' this means it prevents the tibia from moving too much and going behind the femur - the knee buckling back on itself			0
‘ it ’s also possible she pulled the ligament off the leg bones and they fractured			2
she would have dislocated her knee			0
’ fitness experts today warned of the dangers of carrying out exercises such as a leg press without the proper training or supervision			1
sit on the machine with the back and head against the padded support			2
place feet on the foot plate about hip width apart , ensuring the heels are flat against the platform			0
the legs should form a 90 degree angle at the knee and the knees should be in line with the feet			2
brace the abdominal muscles and push the platform away with heels			0
do n't lock the knees or relax when the leg is extended			2
slowly allow the platform to lower back to its starting position by bending the knees in a controlled manner			2
make sure heels are always touching the plate , the knees are not bowing outwards or inwards and ensure the head is steady			0
start with a modest weight and progress to a higher weight if comfortable			2
some said that resistance machines such as the leg press are dangerous because they isolate muscles in a way that does not mimic ' real life ' movement , while others warned a person should always concentrate when carrying out such exercise			1
@entity129 , fitness manager at @entity130 , @entity131 , said : ' this video is an extreme example of what could happen during exercise when not performed correctly , however that is a underlying point that should be addressed			0
' a number of people visit the gym with little or no experience of how to use the equipment effectively and more importantly safely			0
' often gym - goers will lift weights that are too heavy or use machines with poor technique as highlighted in the video			2
' if it is your first time in the gym or you are starting out with a new routine you should try , where possible , to consult a fitness professional or coach who will be able to show you the how the machine or equipment should be used properly			0
' personal trainers are an invaluable source of expertise and to make a positive start to somebody ’s experience of gyms it is worth using a good personal trainer to teach all the basics in the gym			0
' there are countless exercises that can be performed in the gym but they do all generally revolve around similar movement patterns , such as the push , pull , hip hinge or squat			0
' a good understanding of these moves basic moves with good technique , posture and body alignment will assist every gym - goer with most of the beginner and intermediate exercises			0
' by having the understanding of what good technique looks and feels like , gym goers will be able to perform their exercises in a safe manner and make progress quickly to more advanced exercises			0
' @entity188 , founder of @entity189 , @entity131 , said machines such as a leg press can be dangerous as they isolate muscles in a way that does not mimic how a person would normally move			1
after lifting the weight for the second time , the woman relaxed her legs instead of keeping them bent			1
this meant the weight bore down on her legs , forcing them to bend the wrong way and snapping her bone she said : ‘ the problem with leg press machines and many other weight machines is that they create a way of moving weights whilst isolating certain muscles and joints			1
‘ the body is not supposed to move like this			0
instead when the human body moves an object we tend to use a whole bunch of different muscles and joints to get the job done			0
‘ these weight machines create an unreal environment , using inappropriately heavy weights and incorrect form can , as the video shows , cause problems			1
‘ i have seen many injuries to people 's lower backs from leg press machines in particular , as they lift weights that are too heavy			1
‘ through research the fitness industry has now moved away from sending clients on this kind of machine and i would recommend people use free weights to do exercise such as a squat , spilt lunge or a waking lunge			1
’ @entity244 , a trainer for @entity245 and body retreat , added that concentrating while lifting weights is key			1
he said : ' you should never relax your legs in a fully extended position due to the risk of hyperextension			2
' if she is using a heavy load , she should be mentally focused at the task in hand , this would ensure her muscles are switched on and functioning properly			0
' she could also be new to strength training and as a result her joints might not be used to being under heavy stress			0
' if she is hypermobile she might be at even greater risk of injury as these peoples muscles do not know when to stop movements and can have serious injuries as a result			0
' golden rules for the leg press or any other strength based exercises would be : focus , brace then contract			1
