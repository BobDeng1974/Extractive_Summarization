the compare and contrast makes miserable reading for @entity3 supporters			1
going into the @entity5 back in december the team was on a run of 21 straight wins			1
they had scored 79 goals in the process and conceded just ten			2
@entity11 had scored 25 goals in the first 15 games of the season with @entity15 trailing in his wake 12 goals behind			1
with new signings @entity18 and @entity20 a huge success @entity23 ’s only problem was keeping everyone happy as he tried to fit all his stars into the starting @entity26 when they beat @entity29 to win in @entity30 they were crowned @entity5 champions and there were few who contested their status as the best team on the planet			0
@entity11 looks dejected after @entity3 fell embarrassingly to local rivals @entity37 the @entity39 giants celebrate their @entity5 win over @entity29 back in december @entity40 said @entity3 were ' humiliated ' against @entity37 fast forward to the return of @entity43 football and they are no longer the favourites to win the competition having been overtaken by @entity46			1
the team @entity23 will field in the @entity48 against @entity49 on wednesday will be much weaker than the side he was able to pick in december and leading scorer @entity11 has found the net just three times since the turn of the year			1
even before christmas @entity3 ’s coaching staff were concerned about a possible dip at the start of the new year			1
they knew that the @entity57 meant two extra fixtures ( made three by a winter break friendly against @entity60 )			1
@entity23 and his assistants also knew that there were certain players who were running close to empty having had big @entity65 tournaments in the summer and played too many games since			0
and the fixture calendar had not been kind pairing them with @entity69 and three times against @entity37 – twice in the @entity65 and once away in the league			0
@entity3 lost three of those four games			2
stats courtesy of @entity74 real goalkeeper @entity75 is back in the supporters ' bad books after his slip in the 4 - 0 defeat by @entity37 in goal @entity75 ’ mistake for the first goal in 4 - 0 league defeat to @entity37 means he is being whistled again by his own supporters			0
in front of him the defence is creaking			0
without the hamstrung @entity89 there is no one to bring the ball out from the back and with @entity94 missing there has been a lack of defensive organisation too			0
@entity23 might have to repeat the inexperienced pairing of @entity98 and @entity99 on tuesday against @entity49 although @entity94 is racing to get back in time to play the game			2
the midfield trio of @entity18 , @entity20 and @entity102 has been hit by injury with the latter two both missing			0
at first the absence of the @entity107 former @entity106 midfielder was not felt too much but with @entity18 tiring from having to play every game he has been missed more than ever in the last few games			0
summer arrival @entity18 ( centre ) has had to hold the fort for the injured @entity20 and @entity113 @entity11 ( right ) was criticised after he was pictured celebrating his 30th birthday after the loss to @entity37 @entity23 has little faith in @entity117 who the club signed for € 30m two years ago from @entity120 so winter signing @entity121 might have to be pitched in against @entity49			1
up - front @entity11 ’s misfiring has been the biggest cause for concern			2
he gave @entity15 an ‘ i ’m coming for you ’ message at the @entity128 ceremony at the start of the year but he has only scored four goals in his last 10 games and @entity15 is now just two goals behind him in the goalscoring charts			2
so much for the theory that having scored 25 goals in 15 games @entity11 could finish the season with 70 goals			1
on the plus side @entity3 are in the capable hands of @entity23 who has steered many a big team through this mid-season crisis			2
not that there is much love for him from the @entity148 where he was booed when his name was read out at the weekend			0
there is also the plus of the form of @entity154 who was again outstanding at the weekend in the unconvincing win over @entity157			0
@entity158 , @entity159 and @entity94 ( left to right ) celebrate their @entity161 romping of @entity49 last season and perhaps most encouragingly for their supporters the precedents from last year in terms of matches between @entity49 and @entity3 are very positive			1
in february 2014 @entity3 beat @entity49 6 - 1 in @entity168 with the @entity169 – @entity159 , @entity158 and @entity170 – all scoring twice			1
@entity3 are on a run of 19 straight wins in the @entity43 so another victory will take them to 20			1
and if it 's a big win like last season they will feel a little more comfortable wearing that @entity5 champions crest on their shirts			0
the one that seems to have cursed them since the turn of the year .			0

@entity3 were in *scintillating* form before going into the winter break
@entity11 has scored just three goals since the start of 2015
however , @entity3 are on a run of 19 straight wins in the @entity43
the @entity192 giants face @entity49 in the last 16 first *leg* on wednesday night
