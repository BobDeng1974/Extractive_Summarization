boss : @entity1 , pictured by secret services , was too fat to run around with a gun at a terrorist training camp in @entity5 so learned how to make bombs instead the ' four lions ' gang that planned the biggest terrorist atrocity the @entity10 has faced in a generation was led by a 23 - stone chemist deemed too fat to be a suicide bomber			1
nicknamed ' @entity15 ' and ' @entity16 ' by his fellow plotters , it was @entity19 's bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb - making skills while at training camps in @entity5			1
the 31 - year - old was too overweight to go on physical training exercises , and admitted he was mixing chemicals rather than ' running up and down the mountains with weapons '			2
@entity19 gained an a at a level chemistry , and honed his skills during a four year pharmaceuticals course at @entity31 in @entity32 , coming out with a 2:2 degree in 2003			1
he barely worked afterwards and spent his time showing his fellow terrorists how to make a bomb out of sports injury treatments			2
his fascination for science first began during experiments at school while studying for @entity43 chemistry classes , when the teacher showed him how to distil chemicals with a @entity48 burner			0
' when i was doing my gcses , one of the teachers did an experiment where he had a @entity48 burner and he threw a chemical on to the fire ' , he told the court			0
' it caused a massive flame which blackened the roof , and that kind of got me into it			0
' after a raid on the group 's headquarters in @entity32 , @entity19 had chemistry textbooks left over from his university days on his book shelves in his bedroom , mixed in with a @entity70 flag and terrorist handbooks			1
training camps : ' @entity73 ( right ) and ' @entity74 were caught on @entity75 going back and forth to @entity5 to receive instruction on plotting their attack on @entity10 arrest : @entity19 , right , who weighs 23 stone , was picked up by police as he drove the rest of the gang to get a takeaway in 2011 headquarters : the group 's safe house in @entity32 was filled with @entity16 's chemistry books , mixed with terrorist handbooks and a computer used to search for the @entity90 he had also searched repeatedly online for bomb making tips and details of how to concoct homemade explosives			1
among his @entity96 search history was a website containing the @entity90			0
@entity16 admitted in court he had spent eight - and - a - half years memorising the @entity99 , from the age of 19			2
he wanted to treat himself to a quad bike in the run up to his martyrdom and was overheard telling his fellow plotters : ' it 's good fun , yeah , but i would n't do it on the road - that 's not befitting , bro			1
a guy with a beard and that sitting on top of that does n't look good			0
' the chemist : @entity19 gained an a at a level chemistry , and honed his skills during a four year pharmaceuticals course at @entity31 in @entity32 , coming out with a 2:2 degree in 2003 jihadist : @entity119 was bent on killing himself and many others in a terror attack on @entity10 but refused to give evidence in court so his motives are unclear his blood - thirsty lieutenant was @entity119 , 27 , who has steadfastly refused to reveal anything about his terrorist activities or intentions , and did not give evidence in court			1
dubbed ' @entity74 ' to distinguish him from the heftier @entity19 , he had previously worked as a security guard in march 2010			1
@entity74 , also nicknamed @entity132 , is only recorded as completing two shifts , and this was his only known job			1
@entity74 joined @entity19 on their two journeys to @entity5 , recording suicide videos while they were out there and boasting about the contents on their return			1
he was recorded by police chillingly predicting he would be dead by june 2011 , but how he was propelled to this deadly aim remains largely a mystery			0
born march 1 , 1985 , he was born and raised in @entity32 in the same @entity145 - dominated community as his fellow plotters			2
records show he was an erstwhile student at @entity148 between 2001 and 2003 , and emerged with a handful of qualifications			0
he achieved a @entity152 key skills qualification in information technology during his time at the college , as well as completing a course in @entity157 to @entity158			0
but this did not lead to a full time job , and there are no records of @entity74 paying tax in the intervening period			1
@entity74 , like @entity165 , also suffered from vision problems and needed contacts lenses after suffering a head injury at some point in his past			1
@entity19 left and @entity119 holding buckets undertaking bogus charity collections in @entity32 @entity165 , 27 , who joked that the band of terrorists were like the cell depicted in @entity177 comedy film ' @entity178 ' , and aped the main character by distancing himself from his wife to protect her finally there was @entity165 , 27 , who joked that the band of terrorists were like the cell depicted in @entity177 comedy film ' @entity178 ' , and aped the main character by distancing himself from his wife to protect her			1
prosecutors showed he was secretly recorded telling @entity183 that he was planning to head abroad for @entity184 , and later confessed the split from his wife was to insulate her from the terrorist intentions			0
he referenced @entity178 directly in the calls , and prosecutors argued successfully that although he was half - joking , @entity165 was taking his role as a terrorist very seriously			1
@entity165 's own defence offered up another alternative explanation , however			2
that @entity165 was propelled towards suicide martyrdom because of despair at the break - up of his marriage			1
he told the court he split from @entity198 in the summer of 2010 after she moved in with her parents while they looked for somewhere to live together			0
the newly - married couple slept on a mattress in the living room in cramped conditions for a while before she finally put an end to the relationship			0
texts from @entity165 show him begging for a second chance to make the marriage work , but he was apparently spurned time and time again			1
he claimed that he knew what it would be like to kill others because his own life had been shattered by their divorce			0
he wrote : ' i would know how it feels because you destroyed mine , when i begged you that night not to leave me but you did			0
' that was the day when both of our lives were destroyed			0
' @entity165 is severely visually impaired and was forced to read documents in court on a large screen			2
his vision is so bad that he struggles to make out the facial expressions of people he is talking to and requires large print to read anything			0
joker : @entity165 ( right ) , pictured street collecting with @entity236 , compared the group to the gang in the film @entity178 and wanted to die a martyr after his marriage break - up he also suffers hearing difficulties because of a botched attempt to syringe wax out of his own @entity247 detectives raided his home , they found he had downloaded nearly 150 @entity250 lectures from the @entity96 , including extremist rants , and passed them on to @entity19			1
among the hoard of videos were lectures by radical preacher @entity256 , an @entity257 cleric killed by a @entity259 drone attack in @entity260 in 2010 just 12 days after the trio were arrested			0
@entity165 converted his home in @entity262 , @entity32 into a fledgling bomb factory , where chemicals could be distilled by the terrorist crew			1
he had only recently moved to the address after the breakdown of his marriage to @entity183			0
[ caption @entity165 's defence barristers tried to paint him as merely a ' chai wallah ' who provided refreshments to his friends but was only joking when taped discussing suicide bombing plans			2
but @entity165 was also the one who scouted out a possible loan from @entity277 to set up the @entity279 shop cover			2
his cv contained a tissue of lies , included inflated exam grades and claims he was a gym instructor when in fact he worked as a receptionist			0
he claimed to have @entity288 or d grades for subjects such as @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 , when in reality , he had achieved no higher than an @entity295 his cv also falsely stated that he had been regional manager for the @entity297 charity , when he had just been a collector			0
prior to his arrest , @entity165 was running a legitimate business repairing bicycles for Â£ 25 a time , but his disabilities meant he sometimes took two days on just one repair and it was not a business he could live off .			2

@entity19 learned bomb - making abroad because he was too unfit to run
his blood - thirsty lieutenant ' @entity74 was desperate to die in jihad
near - blind joker @entity165 , 27 , became an extremist after a marriage break - up
