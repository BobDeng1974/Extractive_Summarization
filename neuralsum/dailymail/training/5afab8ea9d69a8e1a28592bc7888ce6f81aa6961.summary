former bishop of rochester @entity0 urged @entity2 to continue to fight plans to scrap the promise to ' love my @entity5 ' a @entity7 yesterday urged @entity2 leaders to continue to fight plans to scrap the promise to ‘ love my @entity5 ’			1
@entity0 , formerly @entity11 , said they should follow the example of ‘ rogue ’ leaders who are defying their national @entity16 ’s controversial orders			1
from next month youngsters will instead promise to ‘ be true to myself and develop my beliefs ’ after it was decreed the old promise could discourage new members from joining			2
however , a group of guide leaders in @entity26 , @entity27 , are resisting adopting the new promise , saying the organisation has ‘ @entity5 at its core ’			1
@entity31 said : ‘ if there are others like this group – indeed i would hope that there are many others like it – why should they not be allowed to continue to have a reference to @entity5 ? if these people really believe in diversity they would allow them to do that			1
why should they face expulsion from the @entity2 movement which is rooted in the @entity2 faith ? ’ warning the row could lead to a split in the guides as a whole , he added : ‘ ultimately if there is not going to be any diversity permitted , these people may need to group together in a way that they can support one another			0
’ @entity55 , who runs @entity51 in @entity26 , @entity57 leader @entity56 and @entity58 , who runs the rainbows for younger girls , criticised the change in a letter to a local newspaper			0
a decision was made in june to replace the allegiance to @entity5 with the words ' be true to myself and develop my beliefs ' ( file picture ) they said : ‘ @entity71 has @entity5 at its core and anyone who has issue with this is free to start their own organisation			1
’ their stance prompted an atheist leader who recently joined their group to enlist the @entity83 to help her ensure the new , secular pledge is adopted , arguing she is acting in the interests of ‘ feminism ’			0
@entity87 , 28 , who was a guide as a teenager and calls herself a ‘ post-punk , feminist poet ’ , joined the @entity26 group in june after hearing about the secular promise			1
but she claims other leaders ’ ‘ insistence on keeping the old promise ’ excludes her and atheist girls from joining the troop ‘ or asks us to lie when making the promise ’			1
she added : ‘ it is just unfortunate that there are little bastions of people who are actually wrong about the @entity107 movement – they think it is based on @entity5 but actually it is based on girls			2
a mention of vowing to love or serve @entity5 has been included in the promise since the @entity2 began in 1910			1
this picture shows a hail for the @entity116 from some of the 4,000 @entity2 at the @entity118 in @entity119 in august 1957 ‘ my motivation is feminism and community based			0
this is a clash between the old promise and the new			2
’ the @entity83 , has written to @entity71 seeking clarification that all groups will be required to use the new promise			2
yesterday mrs @entity55 , who has been a guide leader for more than 20 years , met with other senior leaders in a bid to ease tensions			2
she said : ‘ i ’m part of this fantastic organisation which changes girls ’ lives			0
‘ but this is turning into something very destructive and i ’ve no desire to get into a shouting match with the @entity83			0
’ chief guide @entity140 said : ‘ when members make their promise after september 1 the new promise must be used			0
‘ whilst all leaders will need to accept this change as we go forward , we will be talking with leaders who are anxious to help them resolve any difficulties			0
‘ we sincerely hope it wo n’t be necessary for anyone to leave the organisation			0

decision made in june to *abandon* the old promise to ' love my @entity5 '
@entity0 urged @entity158 leaders to fight to keep it
' @entity162 leaders have vowed they will stick with allegiance
@entity7 said leaders should follow ' rogue ' example and fight plans
