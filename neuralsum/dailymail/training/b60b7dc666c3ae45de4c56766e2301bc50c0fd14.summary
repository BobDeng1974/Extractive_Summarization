by @entity0 @entity1 talks from a position of authority when he discusses the @entity4			1
he is , after all , a member of an exclusive club — those who know how it feels to score in the final			0
only 56 players have scored in a @entity4 final and @entity1 belongs to the elite collection who know the elation of scoring the winner			1
he is admirably modest for someone who has seen , done and won so much			0
but his shy eyes sparkle when asked to recount the proudest moment of his glittering career four years ago , a glimpse of beauty in an otherwise ugly final with @entity22 at @entity23 in @entity24			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity27 players training ... same please ! @entity1 believes @entity27 can repeat their 2010 triumph by winning the @entity4 again commeth the man : @entity1 scored the winning goal in @entity27 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity22 in 2010 everybody loves @entity35 fighting ! @entity22 tried to unsettle @entity27 by using destructive tactics in the final ‘ it was the best thing that ’s ever happened to me , ’ @entity1 recalls			1
‘ not only for me on a personal level but also for the @entity41 team			0
‘ there are not many other moments in life when you can feel any more overjoyed than that			0
’ only two of the @entity49 outfield players were not booked by @entity51 referee @entity50 , with playmaker @entity1 seemingly the no 1 target in their brutal masterplan			2
@entity22 ’s strategy of aggressive containment worked for 116 minutes			0
then , with penalties looming , @entity56 released @entity1 inside the box			2
a touch with his outstretched right boot sent it invitingly forward at the perfect height to smash into the far corner			0
‘ when i scored , what was in my mind was that there was n’t a lot of time left and i just really wanted the referee to blow the whistle ! ’ but if the goal was the mark of @entity1 as a player , his celebration was the measure of him as a man			1
after checking for an offside flag , @entity1 whipped off his shirt to reveal a hand - scribbled message dedicated to his @entity27 youth teammate @entity80 , who had died of a heart attack 11 months earlier			1
tribute : @entity27 midfielder celebrated by showing a message in honour of a former teammate who passed away ever present : @entity1 was also part of @entity27 's team that won the @entity89 in 2008 ( @entity90 ) and 2012 ( r ) thirsty work : @entity1 is the official ambassador for drinks company @entity92 at the @entity4 a few seconds of reflection in the ultimate moment of glory			1
the @entity4 triumph in @entity97 is the highest of @entity41 football ’s three peaks — they also won back - to - back @entity100 in 2008 and 2012 — and @entity1 has scaled them all			1
in all three , he was named in the @entity102			0
in 2010 and 2012 , he was chosen @entity103 in the final			2
it is an unprecedented spell of domination but surely it can not continue in @entity107 this summer ? ‘ we hope it will , ’ @entity1 says			1
‘ we have managed an unprecedented feat but there are always challenges			0
this is going to be a new , big challenge going to @entity107 in the position of defending champions			2
’ the core of @entity119 ’s side , featuring @entity1 ’s @entity121 teammates @entity120 , @entity56 and @entity122 , plus @entity123 of @entity124 , remains intact while exciting new additions such as @entity127 ’s @entity126 prove the talent pool has n’t dried up			1
on target : the @entity121 playmaker ( c ) celebrates after scoring in a warm up friendly against @entity132 rare loss : @entity134 ( @entity90 ) celebrates scoring the opening goal as @entity107 beat @entity27 3 - 0 in the @entity137 final but faced with the vibrancy and fluidity of hosts @entity107 in the @entity137 final last summer , @entity27 were starved of possession , off the pace and jaded , losing 3 - 0			1
that was only the third defeat suffered by @entity119 in competitive matches since he took the reins nearly six years ago and @entity1 does not believe their dominance is about to end soon			2
‘ i do n’t believe we are hugely different from last time , ’ he says			0
‘ we ’ve had our moments but we have to keep in mind that @entity27 has one @entity4 and @entity107 has five			1
’ @entity27 have been paired with @entity22 , @entity152 and @entity153 in an awkward looking @entity154 , rivalling @entity156 ’s tricky assignment as the ‘ @entity157 ’			1
‘ i think they will all bring different styles but ultimately football is a leveller , ’ he predicts			0
‘ they are all difficult but we are confident we can get out of the group			0
’ @entity157 : @entity27 must get past @entity164 's @entity22 ( @entity90 ) and @entity165 's @entity152 ( r ) do you believe ? @entity156 should always be considered among the favourites to win , claims @entity1 @entity156 could find themselves on a collision course with the defending champions at the quarter - final stage and @entity1 is characteristically diplomatic on the chances of @entity173 ’s team			1
‘ @entity156 has always got to be a candidate , it has always got to be considered one of the favourites because of the history , because of the players , because they have a particularly defined style , ’ he says			2
‘ they ’ve got really good players , talented players , but apart from that what will really drive them is the desire to improve on the performance they had in 2010			0
’ @entity1 and @entity27 , of course , ca n’t improve on 2010			1
but they would settle for more of the same			0
@entity1 is an ambassador for @entity92 , the official sports drink of the 2014 @entity4 ™			2
