now @entity10 has been told the former prime minister has won permission to expand his ever - growing personal empire known as @entity2 to @entity4			1
diplomatic sources say he has been helped by his growing contacts with the @entity17 , the global commercial wing of the @entity20 regime – although mr @entity2 ’s office last night played this down			0
close ties : @entity2 meet @entity6 during his visit to @entity4 last year it is the latest stage in mr @entity2 ’s remarkable career since leaving @entity27 in 2007 that has seen him maintain his influence and build a fortune estimated at £ 20 million in his dual role as international statesman and entrepreneur			1
his success in winning permission to extend his activities to @entity4 is a major diplomatic and business coup			1

days earlier , when mr @entity2 visited @entity59 , @entity62 ’s government - run news agency @entity60 was more forthcoming			0
it said he wanted to ‘ share his experiences in restructuring economy and attracting investment ’ , among other things			0
it seems likely mr @entity2 will be willing to offer the same advice to the @entity4			1
in addition to his standing as a statesman , he had another major advantage in securing a foothold in @entity4 : his close links with @entity17 , responsible for investing @entity20 ’s £ 300 billion reserves abroad			2
mr @entity2 has made more than ten trips to @entity62 in two - and - a - half years , meeting representatives of @entity17 , and has developed close links with its chairman , @entity82			0
