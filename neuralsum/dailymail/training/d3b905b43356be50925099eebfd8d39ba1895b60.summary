the @entity0 is said to be taking steps to try and make using @entity2 while driving illegal in the @entity3 - a year before the head - mounted device is expected to officially launch			1
stuff magazine exclusively revealed that the government is concerned about how the device , which is worn on a person 's head and shows images on an built - in display , will distract drivers			2
it is said to be taking ' pre-emptive ' steps to get legislation in place before the gadget arrives in the @entity3 next year , by working with police to extend the scope of existing offences			1
@entity22 launched its @entity2 , pictured , device in 2012 and only select customers , known as @entity25 , have been able to get their hands on the technology			1
rumours suggest the glasses will go on general sale later this year @entity31 recently added eyes - free technology to its latest @entity34 software			0
named @entity35 in the car , @entity31 plans to integrate phones with @entity34 into the dashboards of cars			0
if a car is equipped with this technology , a user can connect their handset to the system and use their car 's built - in display and controls			0
the @entity51 - free tool also lets users control this system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road			0
@entity57 added eye tracking to its @entity60 handset with the @entity62 feature that can tell when a user is looking at the display			0
its @entity65 then continued this trend by adding @entity67 , which pauses video when the user 's eyes wander from the screen			0
a spokesman from the @entity73 told stuff : ' we are aware of the impending rollout of @entity2 and are in discussion with the police to ensure that individuals do not use this technology while driving			1
' using a hand - held mobile phone while driving was banned in the @entity3 in december 2003			1
it is already an offence to make phone calls and send text messages while driving , but hands - free devices are allowed			2
under the plans being discussed by the government , the ban could see drivers incurring a £ 60 fine as well as three points on their licence if they use @entity2 while driving			1
this is the same penalty given to people who use a mobile phone while driving , and the ban is likely to equally come under the @entity99			2
according to @entity74 , if the plans are approved it would mean developers would not be allowed to make apps for the device that can be used in cars either			2
a @entity22 spokesperson told stuff : ' we are thinking very carefully about how we design @entity2 because new technology always raises new issues			1
' commenting on the news , @entity110 , technical director at the @entity111 , said : ' usually , common sense is the best benchmark for making a decision about whether technology can make driving safer and easier and it seems the government has taken the right course by being cautious when it comes to the use of @entity2			1
' existing technology already provides distraction enough			2
' ultimately , however , we must not forget the most common distractions in this modern age are talking to passengers , adjusting basic car controls and eating or drinking and this is unlikely to change for some time			0
' the news also comes as @entity22 begins extending the rollout of the gadgets to the friends and family of people already on its @entity132			1
according to reports from technology site @entity135 , @entity22 has started emailing owners invitations with a form that lets them share @entity2 with a friend			1
the email states that anyone using the device must be at least 18 years old and be able to collect the device from @entity145 , @entity146 or @entity147			0
@entity22 's @entity149 programme was launched in february			2
applicants had to post a message on @entity152 or @entity153 with the hashtag ' # ifihadglass ' and , if successful , were given the option to buy @entity156 of the headwear for $ 1,500 ( £ 990 )			0
these editions can be connected to @entity159 or tethered to @entity161 and @entity34 devices			0
the device is activated using the voice command ' @entity164 ' , or it can be activated by running a finger across the side of the glasses .			0
