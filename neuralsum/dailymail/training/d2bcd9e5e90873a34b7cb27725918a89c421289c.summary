by @entity0 so the council for the city of 7,000 residents has agreed to seek entry to a state financial oversight program dating from 1987 that facilitates access to credit and permits the levying of certain taxes			1
now , though , some lawmakers say the program is more like a trap than a benefit : municipalities get into it , and few get out			1
just seven of the 27 local governments to enter state oversight under the program , known as @entity21 , have ever been released from it			1
as a result , legislators want to cap how long cities can stay under state oversight and , in the hardest cases , impose a municipal death penalty that amounts to disincorporation and a state takeover			1
the law was passed in a bid to help @entity33 cities battered by the decline of the @entity36 steel industry in the 1970s and ' 80s			1
@entity37 , 73 , the owner of @entity40 odds and ends shop who was born and raised in @entity43 , @entity33 a public bench in disrepair is seen in @entity43 , @entity33 a woman walks down @entity47 in @entity43 ' we want to hopefully prevent them from going in , but if they do , there needs to be an exit strategy , ' said senator @entity53 , a @entity54 who represents the state capital of @entity56 , which last year sold some of its assets and restructured debt			1
he 's one of the sponsors of a bill that would cap the amount of time a municipality can stay in the program			2
a handful of high - profile failings , such as @entity68 's bankruptcy filing last july , has focused attention on the role states should play in helping their struggling cities			2
about half of @entity36 states have some kind of intervention program , according to @entity77 , a partner at the law firm @entity79 and @entity80 in @entity81			1
state oversight in @entity33 , 20 local governments are operating under state oversight , and six have been in the program for a quarter century or more , according to the state @entity87 , which administers the program			1
the bill now moving through the legislature would codify the state 's early - intervention options and improve financial reporting to allow the state to spot and help troubled municipalities earlier			1
local resident @entity96 , 55 , landscapes his front yard @entity98 , 31 , and his four - year - old daughter , @entity99 , knock on the door of his landlord to pay his rent in @entity43 @entity43 's residents ( l to @entity106 ) @entity107 , 33 , @entity108 , 34 , @entity109 , 27 , @entity110 , 5 , and @entity103 , 22 state oversight under the amended @entity21 would be capped initially at five years , and the absolute limit , with extensions , would be eight			1
imposing a hard deadline could force elected officials to make unpopular decisions such raising taxes , cutting jobs or eliminating services to balance budgets , said @entity121 , a @entity122 state senator from @entity123 and a prime sponsor of the bill			1
he hopes to have legislation ready for governor @entity127 by june			2
under the ' death penalty , ' municipalities would be disincorporated and converted into ' municipal service districts ' run indefinitely by court - appointed administrators , not local elected officials			0
' this would almost never happen , ' @entity121 said			0
' but if something must happen , this is an option			0
' opponents of the bill include @entity140 councilman @entity139 , who pushed for his city for file for bankruptcy in 2011			0
the filing was thrown out later that year after state lawmakers temporarily banned it			2
@entity139 said the eight - year deadline is ' onerous ' given the magnitude of the problems some cities face			0
a woman sits on the street in a wheelchair eating a donut in @entity43 a man walks down @entity47 with darkening clouds forming above the bluff in the distance in @entity43 but weaning these towns from assistance while their local economies still languish has proven to be too tall an order for most of them			0
one of those cities , @entity164 , the @entity166 suburb where former @entity168 tight end and coach @entity167 grew up , entered @entity21 47 the same year the law was implemented			0
since taking office in 2012 , @entity164 mayor @entity171 has focused on getting the city off what he called the ' crutch ' of @entity21			0
the city hired a software management company to improve accounting systems , for example			0
this year marked the first budget in ten years that @entity164 did not have to take out a tax anticipation loan			0
the city typically borrowed between $ 250,000 and $ 350,000 a year , @entity171 said			0
but after decades of distress , there 's no set date for the city to exit the program , which @entity171 called ' a stigma			2
' ' it took forty years to drive this bus into the ditch , ' he said .			0

*shamokin* , @entity33 ca *n't* get loans from banks and is seeking entry into a state financial oversight program
@entity199 hit hard by decline of @entity36 steel industry
state oversight could mean raising taxes , cutting jobs and eliminating services
