by @entity0 a man who blindly jumped off a cliff with a bucket on his head has admitted it was one of the most ridiculous things he has ' ever done '			1
@entity7 , who goes by the name @entity9 , had no idea how close he came to smashing into the ground at @entity13 's @entity12 , until he watched the shocking video back			1
the 33 - year - old from a small town near @entity17 , @entity18 , performed the stunt seven years ago			1
' @entity28 had absolute control of how fast i went , ' mr @entity7 told the @entity33			0
' there is no one else in the world i would have trusted with that , ' he added			0
trusting : his friend ' @entity39 ' was in charge of the rope which saved him from hitting the floor plummeting : the daredevil feel head first down the jagged cliff with the blue bucket on his head before he jumps , the reckless daredevil does a dance , with the blue bucket concealing his sight , and shouts ' watch me fall down '			1
he then leaps off the edge and begins to scream as he plummets down the cliff face			1
his feet run down the first part of the cliff but then he starts to tip head first			2
an almighty crunch can be heard as he reaches the bottom and narrowly avoids crashing into the floor by just a couple of feet			2
the 33 - year - old performed the stunt seven years ago dangerous : he banged his shoulder and received a bruise but did not break any bones he dangles at the bottom and tries to turn himself the right way up again			1
mr @entity7 said the crunching sound was not that of his bones breaking but the bucket hitting the rocks			2
' the bucket saved me , ' he laughed			0
he explained that he actually survived the stunt with just a very large bruise to his shoulder which stuck around for about a month			0
' lucky to be here ' : mr @entity7 said the bucket saved him when he hit the rock mr @entity7 , who is a keen abseiler , admitted : ' i 'm lucky still to be here			0
' despite taking part in numerous dangerous stunts he said the worst pain he has ever felt was when he had his tooth taken out and that he has never broken any bones			0
' i 've done a lot of silly things in my life , ' he confessed .			0
