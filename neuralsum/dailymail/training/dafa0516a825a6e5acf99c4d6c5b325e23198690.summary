@entity1 manager @entity0 has rejected suggestions made by @entity4 manager @entity3 that @entity7 football 's work permit rule should be scrapped			1
@entity3 pointed to the money going out of the country to overseas clubs to sign players like @entity12 , claiming he had wanted to sign the @entity14 winger as a 17 - year - old , and also suggested that opening up the restrictions would help develop young @entity7 players			1
the @entity18 said on thursday : ' if you want to be the best league in the world then you have to accept that you have to produce the best players in the world , so the question is how can you produce the best players ? ' if you put a young player with top - level players , he has more chance to develop			2
if you put him with average players he has more chance to remain average			0
' i do n't agree with that at all , ' he said			0
' there 's already a massive influx of foreign youth coming to academies and us losing the opportunities for young @entity49 players to take up those places			1
' that ( abolishing the work permit rule ) for me , as an @entity7 , is a real no - no. i 'm sure @entity3 , if he was working in @entity18 , would have a similar opinion to me			1
we very rarely do it in this country and have n't done it up until now			0
' we 've got to do it somewhere along the line and get more @entity49 players through			0
' if we open up the doors , the floodgates would open and there would be very , very few @entity49 players who would even get the chance at a football club			2
' @entity0 feels that more should be done to ensure more clubs ' academy players progress to the first - team @entity1 's @entity71 graduated from the club 's academy and has made 201 senior appearances the rules state a player must have featured in 75 per cent of his country 's international matches over the last two years - with his country in the top 70 of @entity81 's rankings - to qualify for a ' @entity82 '			2
should a player fail to meet those criteria , a club can request an appeal hearing to ' consider whether the player is able to contribute significantly to the development of the game at the top level in @entity7 '			2
@entity1 's signing of @entity93 @entity92 star @entity91 required an appeal , as did @entity96 's recent acquisition of @entity98 @entity97			0
@entity3 and @entity4 would also need to succeed in an appeal should they agree a deal for @entity104 's uncapped @entity103 centre - back @entity102			0
' i think the rules are fine at the moment , ' @entity0 added			0
' you can get a work permit if there is an exceptional talent and it can be proven			1
' some of @entity1 's foreign players , like @entity91 , required a work permit to play in @entity7			1

@entity0 says @entity7 football needs the work permit rule
he believes club academies should protect homegrown players
@entity3 believes scrapping it could help youth development
the @entity18 points to the *advantage* of exposure to foreign talent
