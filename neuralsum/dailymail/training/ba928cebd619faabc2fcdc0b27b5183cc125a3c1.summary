by @entity1 reporter from @entity4 to @entity5 , @entity3 's fashionistas are famous for their love of colour , quirky sense of style and penchant for dressing up the frilliest ensembles they can lay their hands on			2
now @entity15 's famously eccentric style scene is the subject of a new book , @entity18 , which shows off the wonderfully girly @entity20 style in all its colourful glory			1
one of the most creative @entity15 style tribes , @entity20 girls dress to show off their individuality with takes on the look ranging from the @entity26 ( sweet and girly ) to @entity27 ( @entity28 )			1
pastel explosion : @entity15 women take sweet and girly dressing to the extreme and it seems they have no fear of over accessorising think pink : kawaii girls love the colour and covert pale skin and clothes with frills , bows and lace living dolls : @entity18 reveals how many of the looks emulate the porcelain toys ' there ’s this aspiration to be cute , and they find that to be incredibly empowering and strong , ' explained author and photographer , @entity49 , in an interview with the @entity51			1
' for these girls , it ’s this process of dressing that allows you to see them for who they are			0
they 're constantly changing themselves ... if you were to go tomorrow , they would be different again			0
' the antithesis of fake - tanned hair - extensioned @entity73 chic , @entity20 girls like pink , kitsch , tutus , delicate dabs of glitter , enormous false lashes and ultra pale skin			2
the most common @entity20 style is named the ' classic @entity26 ' , which despite referencing the @entity76 novel in the name , has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute , girlish and pretty as possible			1
based on frilled and furbelowed @entity84 styles combined with a hint of goth , girls hope to achieve a porcelain - doll look using lashings of lace , ribbon , bows , ruffles , bloomers , aprons , and ruffled petticoats			0
dare to scare : @entity28 is another of the favoured looks , known as @entity95 too cute : the women think such an appearance is empowering and looking girly and pretty is known as the ' classic @entity26 ' , right style fusion : some women combine the pastels with the gothic while others create looks of their own like this military inspired outfit with hints of @entity105 , right @entity84 homage : the girls are fond of lashings of lace , ribbon , bows , ruffles , bloomers , aprons , and ruffled petticoats then there 's the ' @entity26 ' look			1
featuring even more ribbons , bows , and lace , than the ' @entity26 ' , it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels			2
@entity124 is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets , teamed with lighter , less extreme make - up			0
unsurprisingly , the look has also proved a hit with @entity131 teens , some of whom take part in the annual @entity20 fashion show at @entity3 , an annual celebration of all things @entity137 held at @entity140 's @entity139 each july			0
turning back the clock : the ' @entity26 ' look goes overboard on pastels and kitsch with false eyelashes and childish accessories constantly changing : one day the women could go for a vintage ladylike style , while the next , a gas mask is on trend one girl who took part in last year 's show is @entity153 , a fan of the ' @entity26 ' style of @entity20 dressing , which includes piling on the lace , bows and frills in order to appear as sweet and girly as possible			1
but while she loves wearing the look , she does admit it can cause the odd raised eyebrow while out and about in @entity140			0
' sometimes being a @entity20 girl can be hard as a lot of people do n't understand the fashion , and will shout at you in the street , ' she reveals			0
' but i do get a lot of people coming up to me and telling me how much they like my style too			0
i went from loving @entity20 things to being a bit of a kawaii - aholic ! ' @entity174 , the first book from acclaimed @entity177 - based photographer and director @entity178 is out now via @entity179 , distributed in the @entity180 through @entity181 and is available from @entity182 in the @entity131			1
