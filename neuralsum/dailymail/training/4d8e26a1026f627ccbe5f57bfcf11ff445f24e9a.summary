by @entity0 last updated at 11:37 pm on 10th october 2011 a junior football league has stopped publishing the results of its matches in case the scores embarrass the young players			1
@entity7 – made up of 20 divisions ranging from under - 10s to under - 16s – now records all games as either 1 - 0 wins or 1 - 1 draws			1
bosses at the league have defended the decision to withhold the number of goals scored which they claim will spare the youngsters the humiliation of losing badly			2
barmy : the @entity22 have stopped publishing the true results and record all scores as either 1 - 0 , 1 - 1 or 0 - 0 to avoid embarrassing young players but campaigners and parents say the policy teaches children that competition is a bad thing and risks creating a generation of bad losers			1
unrepentant league bosses have defended the policy , saying it is in line with @entity40 guidelines , which the @entity40 disputes			1
the @entity40 says it has no rules relating to results above the age of eight			1
and the league , which was founded in 1984 and has more than 2,000 players from clubs in @entity48 , north @entity49 and @entity50 , will also stop recording results for under - 11 teams altogether from next season			1
one parent , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ this is because they do n’t want kids embarrassed if their team has lost heavily			2
‘ if that ’s the case what ’s the point of having a league table up on the website at all ? ’ another parent , who also did not want to be named for fear of turning officials against his son ’s team , said : ‘ i think it ’s crazy - kids need to learn about winning and losing from an early age			2
they are n’t recognising the boys ’ achievements			0
‘ they might not want to embarrass the losing team but if one of the lads scores six or seven goals and that is n’t recorded what kind of message does that send to them ? ‘ the lads might as well not turn up			0
’ assistant secretary @entity85 said the league had introduced the results policy on its official website this year			2
' still 1 - 0 ... despite 7 goals ' : the @entity90 have stopped recording thrashings - and will get rid of all scores from next season for under - 11s ( file photo ) he said : ‘ @entity40 have said it is a guideline and we chose to go with it			1
if someone else wins , the children do not need to be embarrassed			2
‘ there are mixed feelings about it and it ’s up to each league			0
from next season under - 11s wo n’t even have their results recorded			1
’ he said goal difference did not play a part in determining final league positions and teams finishing on equal points would share their position			0
‘ sometimes there is a 16 - 1 or 16 - 0 goal difference but it ’s not a determining factor in junior football because the league will be shared , ’ he added			1
@entity122 , manager of the under - 11s @entity124 team , backed the move			0
he said : ‘ the children ’s welfare is paramount			0
the winners have three points on the website if they win and the children who lose 20 - 0 would feel very disheartened if it was on the website			1
‘ they might think of not playing			0
i think it ’s a very good idea			0
’ but mr @entity122 added there must come a point when players had to accept defeat			0
he said : ‘ i think probably by the age of 15 then they have an understanding that life is a bit of a competition and we are competing with other people			0
’ @entity148 , the double @entity149 champion , has spoken out in the past about the decline of competitive sports for children			0
she said it risked spawning a generation of bad losers and blamed a culture of political correctness for making ‘ competitiveness ’ a dirty word			0
a spokesman for the @entity40 commented : ' there ’s an @entity40 rule that prohibits the publishing of results and league tables across all media for @entity169 and @entity170 age - groups where the focus of the game is about learning to play without the pressure of full - time scores			1
' for older age groups , there are no rules or @entity40 guidelines which indicate that the final score should be changed			2

all results recorded as 1 - 0 , 1 - 1 or 0 - 0 as league refuses to record thrashings
' @entity40 have said it is a guideline and we chose to go with it . if someone else wins , the children do not need to be embarrassed '
