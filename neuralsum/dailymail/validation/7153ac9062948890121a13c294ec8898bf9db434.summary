@entity1 motorsport boss @entity0 has conceded to being a worried man in the wake of @entity7 's @entity6 @entity5 victory			1
suggestions of another season of @entity1 domination in the wake of a comfortable one - two in the season - opening race in @entity13 were blown apart by @entity14 and @entity7 in @entity6			1
as @entity7 himself noted , his triumph was achieved ' fair and square ' as he beat reigning champion @entity17 by 8.5 seconds , with team - mate @entity18 a further four seconds adrift in third			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 ( right ) was surprised by @entity7 's @entity6 @entity5 victory despite searing heat of more than 30 degrees , @entity7 's @entity14 was kinder on its tyres , stopping just twice compared to three for both @entity17 and @entity18			1
it has left @entity0 concerned , as he said : ' we were pretty sure the three - stop strategy would work for us			2
' we probably went a bit too aggressive on set - up , which pushed us into a direction of a three - stop			0
@entity0 admitted that the @entity28 driver deserved to win and @entity14 got their tactics spot - on in the soaring heat @entity7 celebrates after winning his first race of the season and opening up the @entity34 ' but in the circumstances , with the high temperatures , they were able to go at a faster pace over long runs than us			1
' we need to analyse why that was the case , and it clearly shows it 's not going to be an easy one			2
' it is clear they won the race , which is worrying			0
it would n't be right to say we lost it			0
' @entity50 stats provided by @entity51 @entity7 finished 8.5 seconds ahead of @entity17 ( left ) and 12.5 seconds ahead of @entity18 @entity0 at least gave credit where it is due to @entity14 , although has also admitted to surprise at how quickly his team have been reeled in given their margin of victory in @entity13			1
' @entity14 deserved to win , ' @entity0 added			1
' from a racing perspective , you have to acknowledge they have done a great development over the winter			0
' for @entity50 it ( their win ) is a positive , particularly after all the talk we had in @entity67 of a boring race and @entity1 running away with the championship			2
@entity17 had to pit three times in the race compared to @entity7 's two and that was a major blow for him ' it is what @entity50 needed , but we did n't expect them to catch us this quickly			1
' we were pretty dominant in @entity67 - we were a little bit sceptical about our own advantage			0
' that we 've been caught up by a @entity14 in two weeks , that they beat us fair and square on the track , is a bit of a surprise , but equally a bit of a wake up call , which is good for us			2
' we just need to analyse in the next couple of days where we went wrong , what we need to improve , whether we need to bring any developments forward and put them on the car quicker			0
@entity18 ( 6 ) finished in third and continued his solid start to the @entity50 season in @entity6 ' definitely we need to increase the pace of our development			1
' @entity0 insists , though , @entity1 will not over-react to the situation , particularly as the cooler conditions at the next race in @entity98 in a fortnight are expected to favour his cars			2
' there is no panic , but we are in a new situation , ' he said			0
' we were not in control of things			0
we had new information which was different to what we had assessed over the weekend			0
' things did n't pan out in the way we expected them to pan out , but it was clear the winning streak would not go on forever			0
' the @entity28 celebrates with his @entity14 team after winning the second @entity50 race of the season suggested to @entity0 the loss was the end of an era , he said : ' we must not be extreme in our assessment			1
' in @entity67 there was extreme thinking we would win all season , and here we are two weeks later and we say is this the end of an era ? ' it is not the end of an era - maybe the start of a new era , of a good battle , a battle we would like to take on			2
' it 's about staying calm , assessing , trying to return with confidence and with the speed we have had in the last couple of races			0
