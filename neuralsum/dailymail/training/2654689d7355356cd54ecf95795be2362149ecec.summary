however , the 84 - year - old was taken straight to the softer @entity17 in @entity7 after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults - prompting speculation he had been given special treatment			1

a source told @entity45 newspaper that @entity1 starting his jail stretch at @entity17 was unusual , as prisoners were usually moved their later on in their sentences as a reward for good behaviour			1

' currently around 1,000 prisoners are held at @entity17 , which opened in 1995 , compared with the 1,900 at @entity5 , which was built during the @entity73 era and once held inmates including @entity75 , @entity77 @entity76 , and @entity78			1
it is also where former energy secretary @entity80 started his sentence for perverting the course of justice , having been sent there from @entity86 , before he was moved to @entity87 in @entity88			0
the source suggested @entity1 was sent to the smaller institution to make it easier for guards to observe him , and potentially prevent attacks from other inmates			1

a @entity112 spokesman told @entity113 that the department does not comment on the whereabouts of individual prisoners , and could not comment on where prisoners are usually sent after they have been sentenced at @entity3			0
@entity1 was sentenced earlier this month , after travelling part of the way to @entity3 from his home in @entity122 , @entity123 by boat - where he was seen kissing and joking with friends			1
he showed no emotion as mr @entity127 said the shamed star was a committed sex offender who had taken advantage of his celebrity status to assault four women aged between eight and 19 in plain sight between 1969 and 1986			0

' you took advantage of the trust placed in you because of your celebrity status to commit the offences , ' the judge told @entity1			2
' you clearly got a thrill from committing the offences whilst others were present or nearby			0
‘ you have shown no remorse for your crimes at all			0
' your reputation now lies in ruins , you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself			0
’ it alleged that @entity1 had not revealed a collection of child pornography on his home computer showing children under the age of 13 naked from the waist down posing suggestively beside teddy bears			2
