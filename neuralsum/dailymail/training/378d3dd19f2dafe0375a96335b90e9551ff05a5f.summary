@entity1 ’s quest for the dynamism that just might take them far in the @entity4 began in the best possible way when they amassed the kind of batting riches they will desperately need when the serious business begins in @entity10			0
five players hit 50s and @entity13 contributed an unbeaten 45 as @entity1 smashed 364 for six in their tour opener before wrapping up an emphatic 216 - run victory against an @entity16 it was a satisfying start to a tough assignment for @entity1 but it should be pointed out they could not have begun against more accommodating opposition			1
@entity21 hits out on his way to a score of 51 as @entity1 emphatically beat an @entity24 fellow @entity1 opener @entity25 struck 50 - one of five @entity1 batsmen to hit a half - century @entity25 was out stumped by @entity28 of the @entity16 after hitting his 50 off just 38 balls the hosts boasted just one full - time professional supplemented by a motley collection of part - timers that included four students , a teacher , a @entity36 financier and a bricklayer of @entity39 origin in @entity40			1
still , @entity1 will be encouraged that so many of their probable @entity4 top six hit the ground running in this first of two warm - up games at the @entity44 before their tri-series against @entity10 and @entity46 begins on friday			1
the bad news is that new captain @entity48 again looked out of touch while @entity21 was unconvincing on his return to the opener ’s role in place of the jettisoned @entity54 - even though he was one of the half - centurions			1
@entity1 will prefer to reflect on how @entity25 , at the beginning , and @entity58 , at the end , gave their innings a big - hitting flourish while @entity61 impressed again and @entity62 emphasised once more his increasing importance			1
@entity61 joined in the run fest , hitting 55 as @entity1 posted a massive total of 364 @entity61 plays another nice shot as @entity1 posted an insurmountable total in @entity68 @entity62 smashes the ball away during his innings of 56 off 47 balls at the @entity44 in @entity68 @entity25 , in particular , provides hope for an @entity1 side that could not be going into the premier one - day tournament with expectations any lower			1
the man who proved an all - round success in his first summer of test cricket has taken to his new role as one - day opener like a duck to water and here he hit two sixes and seven fours in a 38 - ball 50 in a partnership of 75 with @entity21			0
it is @entity21 who looks almost certain to line - up alongside @entity25 in next month ’s @entity4 ahead of the more expansive @entity90 but he will need to do more , starting against the @entity91 on wednesday , to justify @entity1 ’s faith			2
here he was dropped in the first over immediately after hitting his first boundary and @entity21 then took another 14 overs before adding his second and final four in an innings ended , sadly predictably , when he holed out to mid-on			0
captain @entity48 is bowled by @entity99 after posting a score of 32 off 37 balls @entity58 hits a six during his innings of 56 from just 27 balls as @entity1 finished with a flourish @entity105 took two wickets for 25 runs as the @entity16 were bowled out for 148 - 216 runs short @entity48 is more of a worry because he is such a key figure for an @entity1 side who hope his elevation to the captaincy will have the same galvanising effect evident in his previous leadership excursions			1
he did hit four fours here but could only manage 32 from 37 balls while all around him cashed in on below par bowling that had only the impressive left - arm spin of teacher @entity99 to commend it			0
at least @entity48 ’s departure cleared the way for the best hitting of the game , @entity58 and @entity126 adding 105 off 50 balls as @entity1 at last managed to add three figures from the last 10 overs of a 50 - over innings			2
@entity58 smashed five sixes in his unbeaten 56 from 27 balls while @entity13 added three of his own in the 27 balls he faced			0
@entity1 celebrate after @entity133 ( third left ) dismissed @entity40 @entity134 celebrates with @entity135 after taking the wicket of @entity137 it was always likely to be far too many for @entity16 and their thankless task was made virtually impossible when @entity133 took three wickets in his first two overs without conceding a run			2
there was also an encouraging return after injury for @entity105 while @entity134 looked short of fitness on his own return to the side and may need to do more against a strong looking prime minister ’s side if he is play against @entity10 in @entity36 on friday			0
not that @entity1 needed to exert themselves to dismiss the hosts for 148 within 33 overs to complete a good day ’s work			0
they know , though , that it is going to get a lot harder than this .			0

@entity1 beat @entity24 by 216 runs in @entity68
five players struck half - centuries as @entity1 posted big total of 364 - 6
@entity21 , @entity25 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity58 all hit 50s
@entity13 hit an unbeaten 45 but @entity48 was out of touch
@entity133 took three wickets as @entity16 were bowled out for 148
@entity25 and @entity105 took two wickets apiece in easy victory
@entity1 have one more warm - up match before start of tri-series
