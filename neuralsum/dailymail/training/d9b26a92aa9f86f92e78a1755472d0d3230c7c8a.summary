@entity0 admits he ’d rather avoid @entity1 if @entity3 ’s side join @entity4 in the @entity6 semi-finals			1
in the first game of the @entity11 era , the @entity8 side claimed their place in the last four of the competition with a one - goal victory over @entity16 courtesy of @entity18 ’s header four minutes from time			1
provided @entity1 see off @entity20 on wednesday night , there ’s a one in three chance of a first @entity23 game in almost three years			1
@entity4 manager @entity24 ca n't hide his delight as @entity18 's header proves to be the winner @entity18 celebrates his fine header with just four minutes to go to secure @entity4 ' win at @entity8 but @entity0 admitted he ’d rather be paired with any side other than their old rivals			1
‘ when you get to the semis , you ca n’t really pick and choose , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ we all know who would be favourites to pick up the domestic trophies before the season starts			1
‘ i do n’t think that would change , so in that respect i would probably take anyone else other than @entity1			1
‘ i do n’t think it is rocket science to work out it would maybe give you a better chance of reaching the final , although it would n’t guarantee it			1
‘ it would be a very , very tough game ( against @entity1 )			2
stating the obvious , we would very much be the underdogs			2
but underdogs can sometimes win			2
’ speaking after his manager , however , match - winner @entity18 said he ’d relish the prospect of facing @entity1 in three months ’ time if fate decreed it			1
‘ it goes without saying that it would be one of the most hyped up games for a wee while , ’ said the 20 - year - old			2
‘ but we will see how the draw goes at the weekend and we will look forward to the semi-final no matter who we play against			2
’ former @entity65 director @entity64 ( left ) was in the stands after becoming a @entity4 consultant @entity4 captain @entity68 rises above the @entity16 defence as he attempts to head his side in front just 13,023 turned up at @entity8 for the first game since it was confirmed that @entity65 owner @entity11 ’s £ 2million loan would give him control over the boardroom			1
@entity11 ’s right - hand man @entity64 — who has initially been employed as a consultant — watched proceedings from the main stand amid an air of expectation that significant change is in the air			1
it was later confirmed that communications director @entity86 , who was brought in by former chief executive @entity87 , is leaving the club with immediate effect			2
asked if he believed he ’d be reporting directly to @entity64 , @entity0 replied : ‘ i do n’t know			1
i have n’t been told anything and i have n’t met anyone yet			2
i don ’ t have any doubt that time will come			2
but right now it ’s about getting the boys brushed down and ready for another tough tie on saturday ( against @entity97 in the @entity98 )			2
‘ i spoke to the chairman ( @entity100 ) and @entity101 ( @entity102 ) on monday and as i see it just now , i ’ll have discussions with anyone - board members or shareholders			0
anyone who wants to talk , i ’ll talk			0
’ asked if he ’d spoken with @entity64 yet , @entity0 said : ‘ i have n’t , no. i obviously was preparing totally for the game saturday but i ’m looking forward to meeting him			1
‘ we are in tomorrow morning and the boys will do their cool down			0
i am available to meet anyone at any time but there are no plans as such			0
’ @entity115 ( left ) is challenged by @entity116 as @entity4 managed to prevail in the @entity117 @entity118 loses possession on tuesday but helped @entity4 reach the @entity6 semi-final @entity0 admitted he was surprised at the low attendance			1
‘ it ’s not the norm , i accept that , ’ he said			0
‘ but as i said before the game , whether there are 500 or 50,000 in the ground , the job is still the same and you have to be professional in the manner you go about your job			0
i felt we did that tonight			0
it was a tough , stubborn first half but we lifted it in the second half and deserved to go through			0
’ @entity0 also heaped praise on @entity18 for his part in extending his side ’s run to five straight wins			1
‘ he ’s a top player , ’ he added			0
‘ i have to say , it was a very important goal but equally the delivery in was from another young lad ( @entity141 ) who has been doing really well for us last year and this year so it was very positive that the two young lads linked up to get us into the semi-final			0
‘ we asked @entity18 at the start of the season to contribute a bit more in terms of his assists and his finishing and he ’s certainly doing that			1
‘ i thought particularly in the first half it was pretty tough and stubborn			0
in the second half , i thought we were a lot better , the better team , and deserved to win the game			0
it was a goal worthy of winning any game			0
’ @entity0 revealed that goalkeeper @entity158 required hospital treatment after colliding with the post while saving @entity162 ’s second - half header			1
‘ i am concerned because he ’s off to hospital for a wee check - up , ’ he went on			0
‘ the doc said it ’s hopefully more precautionary than anything else but would n’t be qualified to give you a comment on it until he ’s been looked at in the hospital			0
fingers crossed he will be all right			0
‘ i have n’t seen it but the boys told me that straight away that was pretty clear			0
you can always tell by the players ’ reaction when another player goes down injured , normally the severity of it , and our lads were wanting the doc on and there was a substitution straight away so it was worrying — very worrying			0
’ @entity4 keeper @entity158 clatters into the post during @entity4 ' @entity6 clash with @entity16 the @entity4 squad celebrate the late winner for @entity0 's side to go into the @entity6 semi-final			1

the @entity8 side are the first to reach the @entity117 last four
@entity4 boss @entity0 has guided his side to five consecutive wins
