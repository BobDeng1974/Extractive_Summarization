one of princess @entity1 's oldest friends has spoken of her joy at becoming @entity4 's godmother			1
@entity5 told @entity6 that she was delighted at the honour and saw her role as an ' important responsibility '			1
the inclusion of mrs @entity5 , 54 , in yesterday 's list of seven godparents was a poignant acknowledgement of @entity15 ’s late mother			1
she met and became friends with @entity1 in 1987 when the two were seated next to each other at a dinner and , according to mrs @entity5 , ' saw something in each other '			1
@entity15 is now royal patron of the charity child @entity41 , of which she is founder patron and trustee			2
the charity does remarkable work in supporting families and professionals when a child dies or when a child suffers a bereavement themselves			0
in her statement @entity53 @entity52 - as she was referred to by @entity51 yesterday - said : ' i am delighted to have been invited to become godmother to @entity57 prince george of cambridge			0
' it is both a joyful and an important responsibility which i am incredibly proud to accept			1
' happy occasion : the proud parents are walked from the chapel by @entity64 , the archbishop of @entity65 who had just baptised @entity4 delight : the @entity67 holds his son @entity4 ( left ) , while the baby is held by @entity29 ( right ) who stands next to the @entity72 , @entity73 quiet : @entity4 appeared contented as he was held by his mother on only his second public appearance since he was carried from the @entity76 in july many will have been hoping for a recognition of @entity1 on such an historic day and mrs @entity5 's presence was just that			1
@entity1 was also very much present not just in the engagement band that glints on the @entity83 ’s finger but in the very choice of the @entity85 itself , where her body lay before the altar so her family and friends could pay their respects in private , before her formal funeral in @entity92 in 1997			1
that link was also one of the reasons that @entity29 chose the chapel to be formally confirmed into the @entity97 before her marriage to prince @entity15 in april 2011			0
mrs @entity5 is herself a bereavement counsellor in the @entity101 paediatrics department of @entity102 , @entity103 , where @entity4 was born			1
softly - spoken and a good listener , @entity104 , has her own private practice , and has ' been a source of strength for @entity15 '			2
born @entity108 and part of the famous brewing dynasty , one of her sisters — @entity113 — went out with prince @entity114			0
she married the @entity115 , of the @entity117 banking family , and had the first of her four children at just 21			0
after the excitement of yesterday 's family christening at the @entity85 in @entity122 , the @entity26 and @entity29 were this morning sitting down with aides as they poured over the formal family photographs taken after the ceremony at neighbouring @entity126 by celebrity photographer @entity127			1
three will be released to the media later today including one historic shot that will , for the first time in more than a century , feature a monarch and three living heirs : the @entity134 , prince @entity114 , 64 , prince @entity15 , 31 and @entity4			1
the last occasion such picture was taken was in 1894 when @entity134 @entity137 was photographed with her son @entity138 , grandson @entity139 and great grandson @entity138 brother : the @entity26 and @entity29 asked their siblings to do the readings during the 45 - minute ceremony , with @entity145 reading @entity146 ( 15 : 1 - 5 ) , which begins ' i am the true vine , and my father is the gardener ' @entity151 : perfection : the @entity134 wore a sky blue cashmere coat with mother of pearl buttons over a paisley dress by @entity158 couturier @entity157 , with a ( warm ! ) cashmere hat made by her redoubtable dresser , @entity161			2
the brooch is a ruby and diamond basket of flowers given to her by @entity139 to mark the birth of prince @entity114 in 1948 siblings : @entity169 and @entity170 walk out of the chapel with the small congregation , including their smiling mother @entity173 yesterday afternoon in an historic ceremony which brought together four generations of the @entity177 , the three - month - old future king was christened by the @entity178 in the @entity85 at @entity122 yesterday			1
dressed in a handmade replica of @entity134 @entity137 ’s daughter ’s christening robe , @entity4 bore a striking resemblance to his father at a similar age			2
he was on his best behaviour			0
with the eyes of the world on him , @entity57 prince george alexander louis of @entity67 put on a perfect display of royal etiquette			0
according to aides , there was n’t ‘ even a peep ’ out of the three - month - old future king as he was baptised by the archbishop of @entity65 , the @entity195 @entity64 , at the @entity85 in @entity122			1
‘ he went in smiling , came out smiling and , as far as we are aware , smiled throughout , ’ said one			0
@entity15 , however , could not resist confiding : ‘ it ’s the first time he ’s been quiet all day			2
’ the archbishop of @entity65 told the congregation in the @entity202 - painted chapel that @entity4 ’s parents and godparents had a ‘ simple task ’ – to ‘ make sure he knows who this @entity207 is ’			1
joyous : @entity134 and the @entity210 followed by the @entity114 ( background ) leave the @entity85 holding programmes from the event colourful : the @entity122 detachment of @entity216 turns out in @entity217 , @entity122 , for the arrival of @entity134 , ahead of the christening still smiling : @entity29 's sister @entity220 leaves @entity51 after the christening of @entity4 at the @entity85 in @entity122 the simplicity of the half - hour ceremony contrasted with the historic grandeur of the surroundings			1
the heart of @entity227 is buried beneath the choir - stalls and @entity229 prayed there for the defence of the realm against the @entity234 armada in 1588			0
@entity4 ’s life too , is already steeped in history			2
the archbishop made the sign of the cross on his head with water taken from the @entity242 , in a royal tradition that dates back to the 12th century			0
the water was poured into the silver @entity245 which was commissioned by @entity137 and @entity246 in 1840 and has been used at every royal christening since			0
his parents ’ guest list for the christening – which left out senior members of the family including prince @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 – was a surprise to some			0
it did , however , result in the ‘ intimacy ’ the @entity26 and @entity29 craved			0
indeed , there were just 23 guests present , giving the christening a feel of a family gathering rather than the moment a future @entity265 was presented to his @entity97			0
for the @entity134 it was very much business as usual			0
she broke away from her schedule for only an hour – and was last night busy hosting a charity reception at the @entity51			0
happy day : @entity269 and husband @entity270 arrive at @entity85 in @entity122 , central @entity271 for the christening of @entity4 of @entity67 out and in : the @entity114 and @entity210 ( right ) leave the chapel			1

@entity280 and his wife ( right ) are also seen departing invited : @entity282 ( centre in left photo ) with partner @entity285 and @entity276 ( right in left ) arrive at @entity85 , where prince @entity287 was also seen ( right ) enthusiasts : @entity289 , many of whom have slept outside overnight , have returned to @entity271 three months after @entity4 's birth so they can celebrate his christening waking up on the big day : royal fan @entity294 and friends waits outside @entity122 hours before the is third in line to the throne will be christened earlier , @entity51 unveiled the long awaited list of godparents			1
among the seven , there was no royalty , just a smattering of close friends , relatives and advisers			0
they are @entity282 , @entity29 and @entity15 ’s flatmate at @entity308 ’s , interior decorator @entity269 , @entity15 ’s cousin @entity274 and his childhood friend @entity278 , one of @entity15 ’s most trusted confidantes			1
at just 22 , @entity25 , @entity26 , was the youngest			0
he is the son of one of the country ’s richest men , the @entity26 , whose wife , @entity315 , is one of @entity15 ’s godmothers			2
adding some gravitas to the group is @entity280 , one of @entity15 ’s longest serving , loyal and most trusted aides , who now works for the royal household on a part - time basis			1
it was in the @entity85 that @entity1 ’s body lay before her funeral in @entity92 in 1997			2
@entity29 also chose the chapel to be confirmed into the @entity97 before her marriage to prince @entity15 in april 2011 .			0

@entity5 being made one of seven god - parents was a poignant acknowledgement of @entity15 ’s late mother

' it is both a joyful and an important responsibility which i am incredibly proud to accept , ' mrs @entity5 said
