@entity0 might just have made the most important pencil mark of his entire career to put himself in contention at @entity4 this weekend			1
the 2013 @entity6 champion ended the day on seven under , sharing third place and is one of a handful of players hanging on to the coat tails of runaway leader @entity12			2
but it took a neat bit of psychology to rescue his round after a disastrous start as he tried to build on his opening - day 67			1
@entity19 bogeyed three of the first four holes , finding himself playing from the trees as he recovered from wayward tee shots			1
and that was where the magic pencil line came to his rescue			1
he revealed : ‘ i was feeling really uncomfortable with my game , so i drew a line on my scorecard at that point , like you draw a line in the sand			2
@entity0 battled back from a nightmare start and is in contention at @entity4 @entity19 tees off at the 18th as he now sits joint third , seven shots behind runaway leader @entity12 @entity19 flips his club after hitting from a trap on the 13th during a decent round for the @entity44 ‘ i told myself to move on and take one shot at a time			1
i made a great birdie at the 5th and that rallied me , and after that i played with the same rhythm as the first day			2
’ the dramatic transformation was then followed by a spectacular back nine with birdies at both par threes , putting tee shots to within a few feet of the hole both times			0
and 34 - year - old @entity19 believes the change of fortune can continue into the weekend			1
he said : ‘ i ’m starting seven back and @entity12 has played beautifully so far , but we all know a lot can happen			0
there ’s magic out there on this course and it ’s up to me to make something special happen			2
’ maybe @entity66 could borrow @entity19 ’s pencil after a disappointing day in which his putter could n’t get going			1
he was par for the round after bogeying the 18th and sits at one over for the tournament			0
he said on @entity72 : ‘ really disappointed			0
it ’s simply unacceptable and disgraceful putting — 34 putts for level par is pathetic			0
’ earlier , 19 - year - old @entity76 had a tough day , shooting a 79 and finishing 13 over			0
he has ben tipped for big things by @entity79 but admitted : ‘ i ’d prepared well for this , but it shows my game is not good enough yet , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i need to work hard on it if i want to get back here			0
