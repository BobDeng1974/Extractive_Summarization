@entity1 boss @entity0 has stressed there has been no decision yet and that the ' right ' one will be made with regard to @entity6 's possible participation for @entity7 at the @entity8 in june			1
earlier this week it was reported that @entity0 would rather 21 - year - old @entity1 midfielder took this summer off to recharge his batteries than be part of @entity15 's @entity14 squad for the tournament in the @entity17			2
@entity0 in january said he did not think @entity6 , given he has already featured for @entity7 's senior side at the @entity19 , then being involved in tournaments like @entity21 could be ' positive for him or the rest of the ( under - 21 ) squad '			0
@entity0 has said he will work with the @entity24 to ensure the ' right ' call is made for @entity6 but the @entity26 was also not ruling anything out , emphasising @entity1 's close relationship with the @entity24 and @entity15			1
and when asked about the matter on wednesday , @entity0 said once again : ' our relationship with the @entity24 is very good			0
@entity6 could be part of the @entity14 squad that will travel to the @entity17 in the summer @entity0 has previously said he is not sure whether @entity6 moving to the @entity33 would be a positive move ' at the end of the matter it is going to be ( about ) what 's best for the player and for the under - 21s in general			0
' we are facing the most important period of the season for the team and for the player , so you can imagine that there is no decision that can be taken now			0
' but our relationship with the @entity24 and @entity15 in this case is very close , and we are going to make the right decision based on what is going to happen between now and the end of the season and the needs that there are from the @entity7 team			1

@entity6 could play for the @entity7 in june
