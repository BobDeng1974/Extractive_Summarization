the @entity7 are without the injured @entity8 and the suspended @entity9 , while @entity11 's men are missing @entity12 who is still at the @entity13			1
here , @entity15 's @entity14 picks the strongest possible @entity16 available for both sides and gives his verdict on which team is better ... the clash between @entity21 and @entity11 's sides could potentially decide the league title @entity1 are sweating on the fitness of star midfielder @entity8 ahead of the clash @entity0 midfielder @entity12 ( left ) is currently on international duty at the @entity13 @entity9 will be absent from the @entity1 starting @entity27 after being banned for three matches @entity1 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity29 9 the best keeper in the league			1

his concentration is so good and he makes saves when needed			2

he has become an absolute warrior			2
@entity42 is one of the best right backs the @entity5 has ever seen @entity48 8 a young man with a big future			1
prone to a mistake but has incredible pace , a good leap and can be a powerhouse with more confidence and experience			2
@entity48 is prone to a mistake but has incredible pace , a good leap and is a powerhouse @entity61 9 having one of his best seasons for @entity1			1
new signings have breathed life into him and his understanding of the game is still exceptional			2
@entity1 skipper @entity61 ( left ) is having one of his best seasons after gaining a new lease of life @entity73 8 does a good job defensively but playing a right - footer at left back means you lose a bit going forward			1
his battle with @entity80 should be a great contest			2
@entity73 ( right ) does a good job defensively for @entity1 but struggles going forward from left back @entity83 8 something of a bit - part player this season but plays at great pace and loves getting after people			1
big role in stopping @entity90			2
@entity83 ( left ) has been a bit - part player this season but has great pace that can be utilised @entity92 9 has become vital in that ‘ @entity94 ’ role , but there is more to his game			2
he has a cultured left foot and with no @entity8 he can help keep up the tempo			0
@entity92 has become vital in defensive midfield for @entity1 but can also dictate the game 's tempo oscar 8.5 a bit disappointing against @entity39 but he works hard and is the first to go and press to win the ball			1
he ’s a real goal threat , too			0
@entity108 works hard , is the first to press the ball for @entity1 and is a real threat in front of goal for the @entity7 @entity113 hazard 9 @entity114 can decide this game but because we know what he can do i would like to see more from him , certainly in terms of variety			1
@entity114 ( left ) can be the player to decide this game due to his pace , trickery and finishing prowess @entity124 8 has great skill and a fine work ethic @entity21 has helped instil , but with the way he can go past players i would like to see more end product			0
@entity124 has a fine work ethic that @entity21 has instilled in him and will run tirelessly for his side didier drogba 8 was a 10/10 player but time has ticked on			0
he can provide a focal point at set - pieces but can he still score in the big games ? just ask @entity139			0
total : @entity140 @entity141 can provide a focal point at set pieces for @entity1 and could turn back the clock on saturday manager : jose mourinho 9 his record speaks for itself , though he has not won a trophy for two years			1
that will change this season			0
he gets the best out of people and his team are in a great position to win the title			0
now they just have to do it			0
@entity21 's record speaks for itself - he gets the best out of players and wins big matches @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) @entity164 8.5 recovered well after a tough spell last year and up there with the best , though not quite at @entity29 ’ level			1
will be keen to atone for a mistake here last season			0
@entity164 ( left ) endured a tough spell last year but is still up there with the best keepers in the league @entity174 9 i love him			0
he ’s the sort of player every youngster in the country should watch as he gives 100 per cent in every game			0
his will be a great battle with @entity114			0
@entity174 ( centre ) is an almost ever - present starter in the @entity0 first xi @entity183 9 if we were doing this last year he is a 9.5 , but at the moment he is struggling for form and fitness			1
he ’ll be pleased to see @entity9 is not playing			0
@entity183 ( left ) is struggling for form and fitness at the moment but is a class act @entity190 8 when he arrived here everyone , including myself , questioned him			0
but he has adapted and has been @entity0 ’s most consistent defender this season			1
@entity190 endured a tough start to his @entity0 career but is their most consistent defender this season @entity199 7.5 faced one of his most difficult periods a few months ago when he was short of confidence			1
but has come through it and provides a good contest out wide			0
@entity199 ( left ) faced a difficult period a few months ago when he was short of confidence @entity80 8 seems to be a @entity11 favourite but does n’t do enough for me			0
can catch pigeons with his pace but will need it to help out @entity174 against @entity114			0
@entity80 ( centre ) seems to be a @entity11 favourite but he does n't offer enough around the park @entity214 8 plays a similar role to @entity216 , but neither are in @entity92 ’s league			0
in some games he will run through brick walls for you but in others he has less impact			0
@entity214 is inconsistent - sometimes in runs through brick walls but other games he has less impact @entity216 8 brilliant last year and one reason why @entity0 won the title			1
@entity214 ’s arrival unsettled him and they have not clicked			0
but without @entity12 , options are limited			0
@entity216 ( right ) was brilliant last year as @entity0 won the title but has been unsettled this campaign @entity234 8 enjoying one of his best seasons			1
when everyone is fit , he might not make @entity0 ’s best side but has a top work ethic and is now a go - to player for @entity11			1
@entity234 ( left ) has a top work ethic and he is now a go - to player for @entity11 @entity90 9.5 my favourite player on the pitch			1
might not grab the headlines but i would pay to watch him every day			0
@entity1 will fret over him more than anyone else			1
@entity90 ( left ) may not grab the headlines but he is the player who makes @entity0 tick @entity251 9.5 when fit , @entity251 is a 10/10 player			1
he struggles coming back from injuries but has two games under his belt and can decide this game in an instant			0
total : @entity140 @entity251 is a 10/10 player when he is fit but he is struggling to return to top form after injury manager @entity11 8.5 won the title last season but that was more down to his squad - and i still feel there are more questions around him than answers			2
his players love him but there will be no love lost with @entity21 on saturday			2
@entity11 's side will fall eight points behind @entity1 if they lose at @entity3 on saturday			1

@entity1 host @entity0 at @entity3 on saturday ( *5.30pm* )
@entity7 can extend lead at the top of the @entity5 to eight points
*visitors* can reduce *deficit* to just two points with *victory* at the bridge
