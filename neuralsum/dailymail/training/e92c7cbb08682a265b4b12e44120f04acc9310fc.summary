the pitch may have been artificial but there was nothing plastic about the performance			0
this was a show of real character by @entity7 , fighting back from a goal down to plant one foot firmly in the last 16 of the @entity9			1
they even played the last half hour a man down after @entity12 was sent off			1
@entity13 led magnificently from the front with a hat - trick			1
the big @entity17 striker has struggled to justify his £ 28million price tag from @entity19 last summer , but here he was almost unplayable			0
it was the perfect hat - trick — header , right foot , left foot — and his first since gatecrashing sir @entity25 ’s farewell game , a potty 5 - 5 draw between @entity27 and @entity28 at @entity29 two years ago			2
@entity13 looks to the sky after netting his first goal of the match to level the scores against @entity34 in @entity35 the @entity17 striker celebrates with @entity7 team - mate @entity37 after scoring his second of the night in the @entity9 last 32 @entity39 ( right ) watches on as @entity13 heads the ball past @entity41 and into the back of the @entity34 net @entity34 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity44 6.5 ; @entity45 5 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 , lecjaks 5.5 ; @entity48 6.5 ( @entity49 90 ) , @entity50 5 ( @entity51 70 , 6 ) ; @entity52 6 ( @entity53 79 , 6 ) , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6.5 ; @entity56 6.5 subs not used : @entity58 , @entity49 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 goal : @entity56 10 booked : @entity63 , @entity45 @entity7 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity64 6.5 ; @entity65 7 , stones 6 , @entity66 7 , @entity67 6 ( @entity68 58 , 6 ) ; @entity69 6.5 ( @entity70 70 , 6 ) , @entity71 7 ; @entity72 6.5 , @entity39 7 , @entity37 6.5 ; @entity13 8 ( @entity73 85 ) subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 scorers : @entity13 24 , 39 , 58 , @entity65 28 booked : @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity13 , @entity80 sent off : stones referee : @entity83 ( @entity84 ) 7 ‘ when you want to describe @entity87 , he ticks every box as a striker , ’ said manager @entity85			1
‘ he has the power , the control and the technical ability , it ’s not normal for a big man like him			0
he ’s a complete striker who can play with his back to the play or get in behind			0
’ the @entity7 boss was at pains to point out that this was a team performance , however , and he was right ; one arguably even better than the victories home and away against @entity103			1
@entity34 had won all seven @entity105 ties at the @entity106 since reverting to an artificial surface after a 5 - 3 loss to @entity109 three years ago			2
but they came up against an @entity7 team whose form in @entity113 has been in stark contrast to their struggles in the @entity116			2
since qualifying for the knockout stage back in november , they had won only two of their 16 games in all competitions			0
‘ when you see us play we get back to the memories of last season — a real enjoyment , bravery and energy to what we do , ’ added @entity85			1
‘ there ’s no expectation or weight on our shoulders			0
i do feel that in the league this season we ’ve felt a little bit cagey at times and we have n’t been able to express ourselves			0
the @entity9 is completely different			0
it feels like a fresh competition , a fresh challenge			0
‘ it was a team performance			0
to come away and concede the first goal , it becomes a big mountain to climb , a real test of character			0
’ @entity34 went ahead in the 10th minute when top - scorer @entity56 , once coveted by former @entity7 boss @entity146 , scooped a shot just inside the post with @entity64 well beaten			1
@entity7 continued to press , however , and stunned the @entity35 with two goals in four minutes			1
both were the result of crosses from the left			0
@entity71 sent over the first , picking out @entity13 who made no mistake as he guided a header past goalkeeper @entity41			2
then in the 28th minute , @entity37 drifted back from what looked like an offside position and drilled the ball to the far post where @entity65 was waiting to poke in			2
and @entity7 took a real grip on the tie when @entity13 claimed his second goal and their third six minutes before half - time			1
@entity34 took an unexpected lead , when @entity56 curled a wonderful effort past @entity64 and into the bottom corner @entity12 ( left ) and @entity66 ( second right ) can only watch on as @entity56 strikes home to give @entity34 a 1 - 0 lead @entity56 celebrated by sprinting to the bench and jumping on his @entity34 team - mates , who were covered in blankets to keep warm again it was fashioned on the left , and again it came from @entity71 , whose low cross was deflected into the path of the @entity17 who could hardly miss from a couple of yards out			1
there was still plenty of work left to do , however , and @entity182 rifled a shot against the foot of the post before @entity13 completed his hat - trick			2
the striker showed great pace to race away on to @entity39 ’s through ball , and then real class to dink the ball over @entity44 as he raced out to try to smother			0
@entity7 were reduced to 10 men two minutes later when @entity80 was shown a straight red card for bringing down @entity56 , who spooned the resulting penalty horribly over the bar			1
it might have made little difference , but @entity7 ’s passage should be even more comfortable when the two teams meet again at @entity200 next week			2
@entity7 striker @entity13 ( right ) beats @entity34 defender @entity201 ( centre ) to the ball , heading in to level the scores at 1 - 1 @entity39 ( right ) joins @entity65 and @entity13 after the latter scored to make it 3 - 1 to @entity7 in the @entity9 last 32 first leg in @entity208 @entity13 wheels away in celebration after heading in to equalise for @entity7 , after @entity85 's side went a goal down early on four minutes after @entity13 's leveller , @entity65 scored a goal of his own to flip the tie in @entity7 's favour and give them a 2 - 1 lead @entity13 ( right ) watches on as @entity65 ( left ) , wrapped around the post , scores @entity7 's second goal of the night against @entity34 @entity65 ( right ) screams in celebration as @entity39 joins him in celebration after his all - important goal in @entity35 on thursday night @entity56 ( right ) is felled by the challenge of stones , who received a red card and missed the last 25 minutes of the game stones ( second right ) watches on as the referee brandishes a straight red card , leaving @entity7 to play out the rest of the match with 10 men @entity80 is guarded by a steward 's umbrella as he receives abuse from the @entity34 fans while making his way off the pitch the ensuing penalty was blazed over the bar by @entity56 ( left ) , formerly of @entity242 , who could not add to his first goal of the match @entity34 ' @entity246 goalkeeper @entity41 stretches to his left , but is unable to stop @entity13 netting his second - and @entity7 's third @entity13 ( left ) , despite calls of offside from the @entity34 defence , had a simple finish for his second goal of the evening @entity34 fans gave their side a memorable welcome as the teams entered the pitch before the @entity9 last 32 match @entity85 watches on ahead of the @entity9 last 32 tie between @entity7 and @entity34 ; he guided his side to an impressive victory			1

@entity85 's side conceded early , as @entity56 curled a wonderful effort into the bottom corner
it did *n't* take long for @entity7 to get back into the game , as @entity13 headed home from inside the box
@entity7 took the lead through @entity65 four minutes later , before @entity13 *grabbed* his second of the night
3 - 1 became 4 - 1 in the second half , with @entity13 topping off his impressive performance with a third goal
@entity12 gave away a penalty and was sent off with 25 minutes remaining , but @entity56 missed from 12 yards
