sickle cell trait means someone is carrying a gene for a serious condition called sickle cell disease , which can cause red blood cells to change their shapes , potentially causing pain and infections			1
if someone has sickle cell trait , it does not mean they have sickle cell disease			2
instead , they are a carrier of the trait and can pass it on to their children			0
if they were to have children with someone else carrying the trait , that child has a 25 per cent chance of being born with sickle cell disease			2
people with sickle cell trait have red blood cells with abnormal hemoglobin ( a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs and returns carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs ) but they have enough normal hemoglobin for red cells to successfully carry oxygen around the body			1
while it is extremely rare for sickle cell trait to cause any complications , there can be problems in conditions of severe physical stress , including low oxygen conditions , severe dehydration , severe physical exercise or very high altitude			1
in these situations , cells can change their shapes , causing pain and further complications			0
sickle cell trait , which is more commonly found in african - americans than other races , is diagnosed with a simple blood test			1
