host commentator thanks for joining @entity38 's coverage of this pre season friendly			2
keep an eye on the site for more of the same as @entity15 and the rest of the big clubs prepare for the big @entity44 kick off next month			1
' it was pretty physical because they 've started the season already so we had to work even harder			0
' today i think i was good and i got a goal			0
i started near the half time and played a good one - two with @entity52 ( @entity17 ) and it 's a decent finish			1
' ' to play 90 minutes for the first time is demanding but i 've been working hard towards fitness			0
' the shoulder is good - if we did n't know that i 'm safe to play i would n't but we made the decision to go ahead			1
' it ends 1 - 1 in @entity60			2
@entity35 superb equaliser cancels out @entity63 's opener that may or not have crossed the line			1
three minutes of added time			0
looks like this is going to end a draw			0
89 mins : pellets make two substitutes with a minute left ... is this time wasting in a pre season friendly ? ! here 's a @entity72 of @entity35 's equaliser : 85 mins : @entity35 looks on fire			2
this time he hits a free kick which skims off the top of the small and out for a corner			0
he 's only 17 , you know			2
83 mins : wonderful play from @entity35 - he goes on a great run through and even despite losing balance he finishes brilliantly into the bottom left hand corner			2
80 mins : another substitute from @entity85 , @entity83 replaces @entity24 deep in midfield			0
78 mins : talk of the devil ... @entity17 has gone up front			0
also , a sub : @entity31 comes on for @entity30			0
77 mins : @entity15 threw @entity17 up front at the weekend and now it 's @entity19 's turn to make some advancing runs			1
the @entity95 skipper wins a corner after finding his way into the penalty area , but the dead ball is wasted			2
69 mins : @entity16 wo n't be giving up his no 1 shirt for @entity101 without a fight - here he makes a good reaction save and tips the ball over the bar from a close range header from @entity63 to keep the score at 1 - 0			1
67 mins : @entity15 have won a series of corners but they 're still not creating a huge amount and @entity16 has to beat away a strike from range as pellets try to counter			1
59 mins : @entity32 , @entity20 and @entity22 come off for @entity33 , @entity23 and @entity21 55 mins : a cross gets knocked back across the box and it comes to @entity116 whose shot comes off @entity16 and hits the bar			1
it 's deemed to be over the line by the linesman after some protests and the @entity124 lead			1
49 mins : @entity18 shows off his reckless side			2
he gave away a penalty against @entity127 at the weekend and now he goes in for a big challenge on the right hand touchline but takes all of the man and none of the ball			2
off we go again in @entity60 as the referee gets us underway			0
@entity35 is coming on for @entity28			0
good news : @entity136 has looked excellent in midfield for @entity15 - sharp passing , snappy challenges and generally looking very impressive			1
a quick screenshot of one of those big tackles is on show below ... bad news : this game is fairly dire			0
@entity15 have n't created any clear cut chances and when they have had a sight of goal it 's been wasted with @entity150 ' keeper @entity149 only having to make easy saves so far			1
where are @entity153 and @entity154 when you need them ? half time whistle goes in @entity60 and it 's 0 - 0			1
@entity85 will no doubt ring the changes at the break			0
34 mins : @entity32 does really well to hold off a defender and puts @entity30 , but the 17 - year - old ca n't convert and his shot hits the ' keeper			2
27 mins : @entity26 goes down in the area looking for a penalty under @entity3 's challenge but he went down easily and it 's certainly not a spot kick			2
easy decision for the referee			0
' crowd bored here already at the @entity172			0
the @entity174 waves have begun			0
' 22 mins : best chance of the half			0
@entity30 's ball comes to @entity26 on the edge of the box and he goes for it first time - does n't connect well enough though			1
it 's tame and well saved			0
21 mins : pellets try to launch a counter attack down their right hand side but @entity20 shows he 'll be a solid option for @entity15 on the left by dealing with it well			1
it 's not the most exciting game so far - the crowd in @entity60 are already onto the @entity174 waves ... 15 mins : @entity32 runs onto a ball from @entity24 but he 's too far wide really to shoot , but he gambles from a tight angle and hits the side netting			1
12 min : @entity26 dinks a ball over the top for @entity28 but it 's slightly too long for him and he ca n't wrap his boot around it to knock it across the box			1
11 mins : @entity136 is keen to impress ... he 's threw himself into a few big tackles so far			0
no holding back which is perhaps surprisingly for someone who spent most of last season out with injury			0
@entity26 , by the way , has changed shirt number			0
he 's switched from sporting the no 15 shirt to @entity207			0
that former , of course , was @entity211 's number when he first joined @entity15			1
is @entity26 leaving it open for the legendary centre forward 's return ? 8 mins : good chance for @entity15 as @entity28 makes a run down the right flank and plays the ball to @entity32 - he slips it through for @entity26 but the @entity219 ( now not off to join the military ) gets tackled as he hesitates on the edge of the area			1
6 mins : bit of a slow start here with no real chances but @entity28 has the first shot on target with a free kick - well struck but easily saved by the goalkeeper			0
and we 're off , @entity15 are in all blue tonight with white socks after sporting their yellow strip against @entity234 and @entity127			1
strong starting line - up from @entity15 there - even if @entity85 is yet to trust his @entity237 players with the chance to come back into the side			1
@entity154 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity153 all crashed out of the group stage and are all left out			0
@entity20 does get a start though - he had the summer off after not being picked by @entity244 , so it will be the first chance to see him in a @entity15 shirt			1
hopefully we 'll be seeing something like this : @entity15 subs : @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity21 , @entity23 , @entity83 , @entity31 , @entity27 , @entity35 , @entity33			2
here 's tonight 's starting line up for @entity15 : starting xi : @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity255 , @entity136 , @entity24 , @entity26 , @entity28 , @entity30 , @entity32			1
so , @entity16 returns to the side after recovering from the dislocated shoulder he suffered in last season 's @entity259 semi final against @entity261			1
@entity20 makes his debut on the left hand side while youngsters @entity28 , @entity32 and @entity30 all get a chance to impress			1
expecting team news soon from @entity60 where @entity15 take on @entity267			2
the @entity269 opponents finished seventh in the @entity124 top flight this season and have already started their new campaign			0
they won 4 - 1 at the weekend so it should be a decent test for @entity85 's side tonight			1
returning from the @entity237 , @entity15 are back in action with their new recruits in tow and you can follow their first game of their @entity282 pre season tour live with @entity38			2
the @entity269 are in action in @entity60 , @entity124 to kick - off their preparations for the 2014/15 season , and @entity154 , @entity153 and @entity20 could all make their debuts			1
@entity85 will continue to give some of his squad 's youngsters a chance too - with @entity32 , @entity28 and more joining the senior players on tour .			2

@entity15 youngster 's brilliant finish *denied* the home side
he ran from his own half via a one - two to score
@entity15 went behind in *controversial* *circumstances* as ball may not have crossed the line
@entity20 made his debut in drab first half
@entity16 made his return from his dislocated shoulder injury
