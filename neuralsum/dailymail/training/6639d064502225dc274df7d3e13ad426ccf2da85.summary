by @entity0 , education correspondent schools are resorting to having kitchen ‘ pods ’ dropped in by crane as the fiasco surrounding @entity7 ’s free meals pledge deepens			1
more than 1,700 primaries have no cooking facilities , it emerged – as research revealed just how ill - equipped they are to meet the promise to four to seven - year - olds from september			1
some plan to hire or buy self - contained mini-kitchenettes which can be lowered into the playground , as they have no permanent kitchen			2
@entity19 , fully self - contained kitchens that can be delivered to schools and can be up and running within a matter of hours others will be forced to provide cold packed lunches to be eaten at classroom desks			2
figures compiled by the @entity27 found that 1,749 schools have no kitchen at all			1
many more need improvements to their kitchens before they can deliver the promise			0
the research emerged as a former adviser to education secretary @entity35 said that the @entity36 gave his department ‘ just a few hours ’ notice of the £ 1billion policy			1
@entity40 said the sudden announcement at last year ’s @entity36 conference meant the ‘ hard graft ’ needed to develop the details of the policy could not be done			0
this had led to problems with implementation and ‘ changes in position ’ , he said			0
the developments came as headteachers questioned the ‘ ethics ’ of handing free meals to well - off children rather than targeting those who are judged most in need			1
leading children 's food expert and @entity60 parenting author , @entity59 , has given traditional school food a radical overhaul , with new child - approved menus for schools that will be launched this coming september ministers have launched a range of initiatives aimed at helping schools meet the september deadline to deliver the policy			2
these include setting up a ‘ small schools taskforce ’ – a coalition of caterers , kitchen designers and others – to assist those with less than 150 pupils			2
it is preparing to launch a pilot next term , which will involve providing up to 30 schools with kitchen pods – small kitchenettes that can handle up to 80 meals			1
they cost between £ 26,000 and £ 38,000 to buy or about £ 10,000 a year to hire			2
schools can order bespoke pods based on their pupil numbers and existing equipment			0
@entity59 , the chef and author , has designed a range of menus that can be easily prepared in the pods , including familiar dishes such as spaghetti bolognese			0
under deputy prime minister mr @entity7 ’s policy , schools will be required by law to provide a nutritious meal – whether it is hot or cold			0
one headteacher yesterday told how he could not afford the staff needed to supervise pupils at lunchtime			0
despite a call , and subsequent promise for free school meals , more than 1,700 primary schools have no cooking facilities and are too ill - equipped to meet the pledge @entity112 , of @entity113 in @entity114 , told the @entity27 ’s @entity116 show : ‘ we are talking about children as young as four walking round with trays of food			1
they need supervision and that costs money			0
’ mr @entity112 said the free packed lunches already delivered to eligible pupils by outside caterers were ‘ the sort of stuff you get on a train , where it ’s been left to sweat ’			0
he questioned whether spending tens of thousands on giving free meals to pupils in ‘ leafy @entity114 ’ was the best use of the funds			1
@entity134 , chairman of the @entity136 group , raised ‘ ethical issues ’ with the policy			0
mr @entity134 , who is also head of @entity140 ’s @entity139 in @entity141 , said some families could easily afford to spend £ 400 a year on packed lunches , cash that could be better spent on those in real need			0
a spokesman for the @entity148 said : ‘ schools are receiving a huge amount of support to provide free school meals			1
‘ we are providing £ 150million to improve kitchens and dining facilities , as well as £ 22.5million specifically to help smaller schools to provide these meals			1

despite free meals by september pledge , 1,749 schools have no kitchen
*reports* emerged @entity35 gave his department ' few hours notice '
the scheme is *reported* to have cost around £ 1 billion to implement
