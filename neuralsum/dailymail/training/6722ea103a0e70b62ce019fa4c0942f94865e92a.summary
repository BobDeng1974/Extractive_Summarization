she might have been ' exquisitely beautiful ' but according to former @entity3 star @entity2 , 86 , @entity1 was a little broad in the beam			1
this observation , along with many others , appears in the @entity9 veteran 's new memoir , @entity10 : tales from @entity9			1
here @entity2 reveals what he really thinks about his leading ladies , among them @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 - and not all of it 's good			1
dapper gent : @entity2 , who has played @entity3 more times than any other , has written a new memoir @entity1 @entity1 is perhaps better known for the number of her marriages rather than anything else , and i was once coupled with her by @entity25 - albeit platonically			1
it was the studio 's habit of partnering their contract artists with each other to attend events , premieres and dinners , purely for publicity purposes			1
i accompanied @entity34 to one such premier and on to dinner afterwards			1
she was exquisitely beautiful , if a little large in the lower rear region i felt - well , not literally felt , you understand			1
at one point , @entity34 was married to @entity42 , he was husband number three of nine i think , but she was also having an affair with @entity44 ( aka mr ever ready )			1
exquisitely beautiful but a little large in the rear area : @entity2 's verdict on actress @entity1 caught out : one of @entity2 's favourite stories is the tale of @entity1 being caught with @entity44 ( pictured ) @entity50 was a @entity51 diplomat whose reputation as a playboy far exceeded any political accomplishments and was only matched by stories of his sexual prowess			1
@entity42 was obviously aware of something going on between his wife and the playboy and returned home one day , just before @entity60 , propped a ladder against the bedroom window and caught the pair mid-service			2
the ensuing flash of a camera bulb quite put @entity44 off his stroke and there was a mad scramble out of bed as @entity42 gently descended the ladder , and let himself in through the front door to wait at the foot of the stairs			2
@entity34 and @entity44 sheepishly descended			2
' @entity74 ... and to you @entity50 , ' he said in his deliciously wonderful sardonic voice before leaving			2
they divorced the following april and @entity44 continued his womanising ways elsewhere			2
good friend : @entity15 is remembered for her witty conversation and remained a friend after her marriage @entity83 i found myself seated next to @entity15 at dinner one evening at @entity9 hairdresser @entity87 's house			1
the conversation started turning to politics , of which , as a young @entity90 , i knew very little , and @entity15 said to me , ' you know @entity93 sold us down the river '			2
i 'm afraid i had no idea what she was talking about and for some time after that , often kicked myself for being unable to continue the conversation			2
some years later , when i became a regular visitor to the @entity102 and she had become princess @entity15 , she invited me up to the @entity104 's farm retreat , @entity105 , in the hills high above @entity107 and that 's where i first met @entity109 who i guess was 11 or 12			2
family friend : @entity2 first met @entity109 when he was aged 11 or 12 at the @entity104 family farm he struck me as being a very quiet and shy young man , who took great pleasure in showing me the many animals around the farm			1
@entity15 was n't at all stuffy as her royal status would have entitled her to be had she wished			1
far from it , she had a mischievous sense of humour , a glint of naughtiness in her eye - especially saucy ones			2
@entity15 was a very precious gift to @entity127 , albeit for too short a time			2
@entity128 @entity128 was a very funny and pithy lady , though was , perhaps , equally well known for her sexual conquests and husbands as much as her films			2
she was married three times in all , to @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 ; and her high profile affairs included those with @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			2
scandalous : actress @entity128 and @entity135 's scandalous marriage was the source of much gossip in fact , legend has it that while filming @entity149 in 1951 , that she was first attracted to co-star @entity141 , who was himself under contract to @entity152 , with whom @entity128 had been romantically linked			0
' do you mind if i go to bed with @entity128 ? ' he asked			0
' if you do n't , ' @entity152 replied , ' they 'll think you 're a pansy '			1
@entity14 towards the end of my tenure as @entity161 at @entity162 in @entity163 in 1968 , @entity158 moved in on an adjacent stage with a film version of the hit @entity168 play , @entity169			1
it starred @entity9 grande dame @entity14 along with @entity172 and @entity173 in support			1
a very talented , award - winning young director named @entity176 was signed to helm this new @entity158 production , and the @entity179 cast were told that @entity180 was to command their utmost respect , but they were not to approach her directly on set			0
challenging : @entity14 liked to get her own way and had those who annoyed her sacked from their jobs diva : @entity14 ( pictured right ) with @entity172 was a director 's nightmare on the set of @entity169 furthermore , on her first day , they were given instructions to gather round and applaud the star as she made her entrance			1
within a few days it was clear that @entity14 was not only standoffish with her co-stars but was even unwilling to engage in any form of dialogue with @entity176 , ' she was above taking or talking about direction of any kind , ' he said			1
she had the producers fire @entity176 , very unceremoniously , after a week and hired in @entity206 to replace him			0
shortly after , the director of photography was fired after @entity180 accused him of not lighting her properly , and she subsequently gave her own specific instructions on where lights should be placed			0
@entity172 had the dressing room next door to @entity180 ' and she was able to hear the conversations through the radiator pipes and - almost on a daily basis - heard whom @entity180 demanded to be sacked next			0
@entity215 another wonderful actress and feisty lady was @entity215			0
i wrote about @entity215 in my autobiography , about the time in the early 1950s when she taught me how to kiss on the set of the movie @entity223			0
i actually thought my technique was pretty good - i had already been married twice and had n't had many complaints in that department - but @entity215 taught me a new technique of ' passion without pressure ' - what a lady she was ! of course , when she came to make @entity223 , @entity215 was already a huge @entity9 star with lots of classic films to her name - not to mention several husbands and lovers			1
lesson : according to @entity2 , ' real lady ' @entity215 taught him how to kiss on the set of @entity223 in 1956 however , i will also remember her for the day she told our producer on the film , @entity246 , to ' fuck off ' , after a seemingly trivial difference of opinion on set			1
in fact , @entity250 was so upset , he stormed directly off stage and into my trailer , where he was sitting , pink - eyed , when i returned a short while later			0
' i 've known @entity215 since she first walked onto this lot as a young girl , ' he said to me			0
' and now she speaks to me like that , in front of the whole cast and crew ! ' i returned to the set and asked @entity215 why she 'd been so rotten to @entity250 who was , as everyone who knew him will attest , a lovely guy			0
he 'd also overcome disability , leaving him with only one arm , which endeared him to everyone even more			0
' sweetheart , ' she replied matter - of - factly			0
' when i first came on this set , all the producers fucked me			0
so now i 'm fucking them			0
' good friends : @entity2 , his ex-wife @entity2 and @entity16 ( centre ) enjoy a day at the races @entity16 one night , @entity16 was late for a ball in @entity9 which she was attending with @entity277 [ @entity278 ]			1
@entity277 had been brooding about her punctuality for some time , and this time , he snapped , ' you are f * * * ing boring '			0
' and you are a boring f * * * , ' snapped @entity16 , without a blink			0
@entity16 has a lovely turn of phrase , as does her sister @entity284			0
their father , @entity289 , was a big theatrical agent in the 1950s and was , in fact , my wife @entity286 ' agent , and i got to know him well			0
@entity291 : @entity16 has a way with words and refused to let anything stand in the way of her marriages he was a very dashing , handsome man - about - town and @entity301 , his wife , was a very graceful , classically beautiful woman who believed implicitly in @entity16 's innocence			0
when @entity16 announced to @entity301 that she wanted to marry @entity303 , the man to whom she 'd lost her virginity , @entity301 said , ' @entity305 , he 's an actor - and a spivvy sort of actor at that			0
but @entity310 wo n't allow that			1
' ' then i will live with him , ' @entity16 replied , with a flourish			0
@entity301 told me she never doubted it and that 's why they agreed to the marriage			0
@entity10 : tales from @entity9 , Â£ 20 , is published by @entity320			1

@entity2 , 86 , says @entity1 was n't quite as perfect as she seemed
@entity14 was a true diva who thought herself ' above direction '
