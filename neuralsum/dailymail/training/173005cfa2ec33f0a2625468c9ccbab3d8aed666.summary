@entity11 , the @entity18 ’s only professional astrologer for cats and dogs , says it is understandable that owners become upset when beloved pets disappear , but argues it is a case of nature over nurture			1
well - starred : astrologer @entity11 ( with her @entity28 dog @entity29 ) says star signs say a lot about character important : @entity11 says that astrology can help you to better understand the family pets the 55 - year - old mystic and mother of three , said : ' it can be in an animal ’s nature to explore			1
the position of the planets when a pet was born really influences their characteristics			1
' some are always going to be very adventurous , others are naturally incredibly homely			2
for example , @entity47 pets are very impulsive and like to assert their control			0
' it ’s especially important to keep these dogs on a lead to guard against their nature , and stop them making a run for it			0
' pet owners who have n't quite managed to pull of the trick include @entity60 star @entity61 who was devastated when her long - haired tabby cat , @entity63 , went missing from her @entity65 home last august			1
luckily for @entity67 , she and her pet were reunited a week later , after the 27 - year - old launched an appeal on @entity70			1
other celebrities have also taken to @entity70 with appeals to find their missing pets , including @entity74 whose chocolate @entity76 ran off during a walk in february			1
' gemini pets are incredibly fast moving and love meeting other people and animals , so could also be quite prone to zipping off down the street for a while , ' adds @entity11			1
' by contrast , @entity85 pets are usually much slower and have a very placid nature so do n’t tend to go missing so much			0
' if your pet is a cancer , they ’ll be a homebird too			1
they like to have their home comforts nearby			0
you can really unlock a lot about your dog or cat ’s personality by looking to the skies when they were born			0
' if your pet does make a bid for freedom , @entity11 says that making the most of astrological know - how can help to bring them home			1
@entity70 : @entity61 and @entity74 both used social media to ask people to help them find their lost pets insight : according to @entity11 , astrology can help shed light on your pet 's character - and stop it from wandering ' most pets are likely to find their own way home sooner or later , but there can be things you can do to help , ' she explains			1
' for example , you should never scold a @entity126 pet			1
they have big egos and it would break their heart			0
so if you ’re out hunting for a missing @entity126 make sure you do n’t sound too cross			0
' geminis are known for being very vocal			0
so if a @entity132 has gone off on an adventure keep an ear out to track them down			0
' and with an @entity47 , it ’s especially important to show them who ’s boss			0
take them to puppy training classes to make sure they know your commands if they do ever try to disappear on an adventure			0
' she added : ' when i see missing pet posters in the street i often wonder what sign the animal is			1
fortunately @entity29 , my @entity28 , has never made a run for it			0
' @entity11 says her keen interest in the zodiac is the legacy of her mother , @entity155 , who would regularly remark on how people ’s personalities were influenced by their star sign			1
' she would even do the same for our pets , ' remembers @entity11			1
' our lovely little @entity161 was , in my mum ’s words , a typical @entity164			0
clients : most of @entity11 's work involves cats like @entity169 ( pictured ) whose horoscope can be found below @entity11 says : ' @entity169 's an explorer			1
she loves playing and chasing , and she 's very curious			1
it 's probably a good idea to keep her stocked up with toys to keep her entertained			1
' as an @entity47 , @entity169 needs to feel as if she 's number one at at all times			1
she likes being in charge , which allows her to act on impulse			0
she 's likely to behave mischievously if she does n't get her way			1
' she 's definitely a loveable rogue and extremely active			2
she 's intrepid , and likes to experience new things			2
she 's usually the first to initiate play			2
' the name @entity169 suits her personality			0
she 's a born entertainer and loves to see people smiling			2
' it 's likely that she 'll want to satisfy her curiosity with the occasional adventure			2
she 's the daredevil of cats at heart			2
' she has the moon , the sun and the @entity193			0
she needs adventure for her emotional , spiritual and physical wellbeing			0
' her @entity196 is in @entity164 which , like @entity47 , is also a fire sign			0
this suggests she has a fiery personality and prone to act on impulse			0
' owner 's verdict : ' i 'm impressed that @entity11 has got so much spot on , particularly her love of people and her liking for getting out and about			1
' she is an old cat though , so she 's doing it a lot less than she used to and is confining her adventures to the house ! ' ' @entity161 had bags of confidence and loved her freedom , and i grew up believing my mum really did have a point			2
' but it was only after giving up her career as an air stewardess to have her children @entity221 , 18 , @entity222 , 17 , and @entity223 , 14 , that @entity224 found the time to truly indulge her passion			0
initially she focused on reading horoscopes for family and friends , but always knew there was a gap in the market to help people to get to know their pets			1
' at first i dismissed the idea , thinking it was far too crazy , ' explains @entity11			1
' but after my mother died in 2007 i started taking the idea more seriously			0
life seemed too short not to give new things a try			2
' so in 2008 i set up my @entity242 business , and started accepting clients for readings in 2009			0
now i ’ve produced horoscopes for well over 100 pets			2
' it gives me a great sense of satisfaction to bring people even closer with their animals			0
knowing your pet ’s star sign can also be an invaluable aid when starting behaviour training too			1
' owners send @entity224 a description or photograph of their prized pet and its birth details , and for £ 30 will receive a 7,000 word detailed reading based on the position of the sun when the animal was born			2
although the bulk of her business is for dogs and cats , @entity224 will happily produce horoscopes for any species , whether horse , cow or reptile			2
she said : ' it is mostly cats and dogs , as the owners need to have the precise date their pet was born			2
that tends to be missing with other animals			0
' but she admits not everyone is convinced , especially her husband @entity287 , 50			0
' although he is really supportive , @entity287 still chalks a lot of horoscopes as down to coincidence , ' reveals @entity11			1
' i ca n’t persuade him			0
i think my kids find it embarrassing too			2
it ’s a bit quirky i suppose			0
' @entity11 has also written a dog owner ’s guide to animal star signs - @entity299 for @entity300 - with a proportion of profits donated to the @entity303 .			1

@entity11 , 55 , is the @entity18 's only professional pet astrologer
says stars can give insight into to your pet 's character and behaviour
horoscopes can even help you find *furry* friends who have wandered
