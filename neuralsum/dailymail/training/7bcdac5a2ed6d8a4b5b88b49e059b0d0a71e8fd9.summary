by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 10:06 est , 11 september 2012 @entity1 : the drill bit on the @entity3 was screwed in to place in an unsterile environment - sparking fears we may end up ' seeding @entity8 with life ' when the curiosity finally extends its drill and bites into the dusty surface of the @entity8 , @entity11 scientists will be quietly hoping that the @entity8 rover will not find ice beneath the surface			1
for if it does , it will blow open a scandal that has been ' simmering ' inside @entity11 for the last year : the fact that the drill bits may well be infected with @entity23 bacteria - bacteria which could survive on @entity8			1
the possible contamination occurred six months ago , when engineers peeked inside the drill mechanism without permission in order to attach one more piece			0
if the drill touches water , there is every chance the bacteria could live			1
this would be a crisis for @entity11 : to meddle with the biological make - up of planet which , for all we know so far , may still have native microbes of its own kind			0
according to the @entity43 , @entity11 does not expect to find water - the space agency chose the dry equatorial landing site in @entity8 ' @entity46 to study the planet 's geology , not in a bid to find water or ice			1
but , the paper adds : ' if by chance the rover curiosity does find @entity55 , a controversy that has simmered at @entity11 for nearly a year will burst into the open			0
' the potential contamination occurred on november 26 last year , after the drill bits had been sterilised and placed in a box , which would not be opened again until a successful touchdown on @entity8			2
but engineers were worried that a rough landing could damage the drill bits - and opened the box to add one more drill bit and increase their chances of success			2
according to the @entity43 , the engineers screwed the drill bit directly into the drill - so that if the loading mechanism failed , curiosity at least had one shot of a successful dig. untampered with : curiosity is returning stunning images of an untouched @entity8 landscape - unless we have sent microbes to the planet the paper adds that under @entity11 's procedures , the box should not have been opened without ' the knowledge of a @entity11 scientist who is responsible for guarding @entity8 against contamination from @entity23 ' but planetary protection officer @entity89 told the paper : ' they should n't have done it without telling me - it is not responsible for us not to follow our own rules			1
' the blunder was apparently spotted before launch , but - as it was too close to launch - @entity11 officials took a ' calculated risk ' to send @entity3 onwards			2
@entity99 , program executive for solar system exploration , said : ' water or ice near the surface in @entity46 was not a significant probability			0
' we weighed that against the risks of not having a bit mounted in the drill prior to launch , and the specter of not being able to drill any holes at all on @entity8			2
' of course , there is always a possibility that @entity8 will surprise us			0
' he added that the box was unsealed in a near - sterile environment , and @entity11 later altered the mission scenario to say that @entity3 could interact with the surface of @entity8 ' as long as there is no ice or water '			1
lastly , the @entity43 spoke to @entity121 , a professor of biology at @entity123 , who said : ' it will be a sad day for @entity11 if they do detect ice or water			0
' that 's because the @entity3 project will most likely be told , " @entity130 , that 's nice			0
' many microbes have proven - both through controlled tests and accidental exposure - that they can survive the vacuum and cosmic radiation of space , and at least one species has survived @entity8 - like conditions in the laboratory			0
with dust cover : the curiosity rover used a camera located on its arm to obtain this self portrait , taken before engineers removed its dust cover @entity11 today revealed stunning new images of @entity3 's wheel on the martian surface taken using the high resolution @entity152 camera , which had its dustcover removed for the first time open : the reclosable dust cover on @entity3 's @entity152 ( @entity152 ) was opened for the first time during the 33rd @entity8 day , or sol , of the rover 's mission on @entity8			1

engineers *decided* to add one last drill to curiosity - and ended up doing it in an *un-sterile* environment
if @entity3 's drill touches water , we may end up ' seeding @entity8 with life '
