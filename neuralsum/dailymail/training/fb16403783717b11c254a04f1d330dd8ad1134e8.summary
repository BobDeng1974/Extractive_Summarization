in what ’s been dubbed a cross between a @entity3 and a quadcopter , physics researchers have designed the world 's first wearable drone			1
called @entity8 , the drone folds up and attaches to a wrist strap			1
when the wearer wants it to start filming , they press a button and the drone unfolds and flies overhead , tracking their movements using motion sensors			1
@entity8 is a drone , worn on the wrist ( concept illustrated ) and expands at the touch of a button			1
the team has created a prototype version and recently received $ 50,000 ( £ 30,700 ) in funding last week , @entity35 and @entity36 both released details about handheld devices set to rival @entity3			1
the former is planning to release the @entity40 - a tiny action camera with a square design			0
and a teaser video and leaked images reveal that @entity36 is planning to release a similar device of its own , in the shape of a toy periscope			0
the @entity40 will be available for £ 89 ( $ 99.99 ) from 1 october			2
@entity36 's camera is due to launch next month			0
the drone then returns to the wearer ’s wrist , which could be controlled using a timer , or summoned using gestures			2
it was developed by dr @entity55 , a physics researcher at @entity22 , with colleagues @entity56 and @entity58			2
and the concept is a finalist in @entity25 ’s annual make it wearable competition			1
as a result , the team has been awarded $ 50,000 ( £ 30,700 ) to help make it a reality			1
in addition to the prize money , all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the @entity72 - based tech giant			0
dr @entity55 has also created an early prototype , which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year			2
the winner of @entity25 ’s competition will be announced on 3 november			1
it is unknown when the @entity8 will go on sale , and how much it will retail for , but @entity80 has contacted the company for more information			0
when the wearer wants it to start filming , they press a button and the drone unfolds ( illustrated ) and flies overhead , tracking their movements using motion sensors			1
the drone then returns to the wearer ’s wrist , which could be controlled using a timer , or summoned using gestures the @entity98 drone is a cross between a @entity3 action camera ( @entity101 pictured left ) and a traditional quadcopter ( stock image pictured right ) other finalists include the @entity106 sports and activity necklace , a wrist - worn air conditioning unit , and a production glove			1
make it wearable is a year - long contest , open to students over the age of 13 , designers , engineers , and makers			0
earlier this year , @entity117 unveiled the first ' pet ' drone that automatically follows its owner - and could change the way sports are filmed			2
@entity22 and physics researcher dr @entity55 has also created an early prototype , ( pictured ) which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year			2
it is unknown when the @entity8 will go on sale , and how much it will retail for , but @entity80 has contacted the firm for more information in addition to the prize money , all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the @entity72 - based tech giant			0
the winner of @entity25 ’s competition will be announced on 3 november			1
this illustration reveals where the camera on the @entity98 drone is positioned it is not wearable , like @entity8 , but the @entity144 drone can be fitted with a @entity3 camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports , tracking everything from skateboarders to @entity151 riders			1
@entity152 tracks and follow users and their trajectory , and has a flight time of up to 15 minutes			0
it can also reach speeds of 40mph ( 64km/h )			0
to use @entity152 , a programmable remote is strapped to the wrist or helmet , and it is likely to retail for $ 995 ( £ 612 )			2
earlier today , @entity3 unveiled its latest models			0
the @entity101 models are available in black for £ 369 ( $ 499 ) , and silver for £ 289 ( $ 399 ) the black model includes 1080p120 video capture , and the silver model has a built - in touchscreen			0
@entity3 also introduced an entry - level model , called hero , for £ 99.99 ( $ 129 )			0
the new line go on sale 5 october .			0

the @entity176 wearable drone was created by researchers at @entity22
it is a finalist in @entity25 ’s annual make it wearable competition
@entity8 is a drone , worn on the wrist and expands at the touch of a button
it flies off , filming its owner using a camera , and tracking their movements
