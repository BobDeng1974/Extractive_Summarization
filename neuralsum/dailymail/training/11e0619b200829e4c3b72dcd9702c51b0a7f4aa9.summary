@entity6 , the seven - stone @entity7 , vanished as owner @entity8 took her for a walk in @entity10 , @entity11			1
he frantically searched bushes and undergrowth in vain unaware she had fallen into the disused shaft			1
seven stone @entity6 was rescued from a 25 - metre mine shaft after treading water for 24 hours @entity8 , a pub landlord , spent a sleepless night worrying and returned to the scene the following morning			1
when he heard @entity6 's faint whimpering from the hole he realised that the exhausted dog had been swimming in the water for 24 hours			1
he raised the alarm and a 19 - strong rescue team of firefighters swung into action and lowered a cargo net to reach her			1
it took two men to lift the hefty 45kg dog and the crew were amazed she had managed to keep herself afloat for an entire day			2
@entity6 fell down the mineshaft after she went into the undergrowth while out walking it took a team of 19 firemen to rescue @entity6 using a cargo net that was lowered into the shaft @entity8 , 67 , who runs the nearby @entity41 , said : ' she just went into the undergrowth , as she normally does , and did not come back			1
' i searched the area but could n't find her			2
it was so windy i could n't really hear anything			0
' i set out early the following morning , i had n't really slept because i was so worried			0
' i was calling her name for ages and eventually i head @entity6 's whimper in the distance			2
' i kept calling her and eventually came across an open mine shaft			2
it was too far down to see , but i heard her respond to my call			0
' @entity6 seen here in the cargo net after spending the night treading water @entity8 has praised the firemen after the ordeal , saying that they had worked quickly and efficiently @entity6 was cold and numb after her ordeal but otherwise unscathed and was taken home to the pub after her 45 - minute rescue to warm up in front of the fire			1
@entity8 added : ' all of the firefighters had a role , they were very efficient			0
i can not praise them enough			0
they gathered quickly , analysed the situation and cracked on			0
' i urge dog owners just to be aware of the mine shafts			0
i am going to speak to various people to try and get some barriers put up to stop this happening again			0
