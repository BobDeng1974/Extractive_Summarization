disincentivising jargon in official dialogue : the kind of language used by sir @entity4 in yes minister , the archetypal civil service technocrat it looks like the end of the road for ‘ facilitating ’ policies , ‘ engaging with stakeholders ’ and ‘ disincentivising ’ waste			1
civil servants have been told to stop using meaningless jargon that confuses people about what the government is doing			1
instead of peppering policy announcements with buzzwords , @entity19 officials have been told they must address the public in ‘ plain @entity23 ’ , according to new guidance			1
it is accompanied by a list of more than 30 banned words and phrases which recall the worst of @entity4 in yes minister			2
among the banned words and phrases are ‘ slimming down ’ ; ‘ strengthen ’ unless referring to a bridge or other structure ; ‘ drive ’ a policy ; or hold a ‘ dialogue ’ when they mean speaking to people			1
also unacceptable are ‘ foster ’ unless it refers to children , ‘ deploy ’ unless it ’s a lethal weapon , and ‘ deliver ’ - the guidance says ‘ pizzas , post and services are delivered - not abstract concepts like ‘ improvements or priorities ’			1
the online style guide is published on the government ’s new website www.gov.uk which has replaced those for individual departments , so all the information the public need is one place			1
however it is not to be referred to a ‘ one stop shop ’ - that term is firmly on the banned list , accompanied by the advice ‘ we are government , not a retail outlet ’			1
civil servants are told announcements will be wasted if no - one can understand them			1
‘ we lose trust from our users if we write government ‘ buzzwords ’ and jargon			1
often , these words are too general and vague and can lead to misinterpretation or empty , meaningless text			2
’ instead they should use ‘ buy ’ instead of ‘ purchase ’ , ‘ help ’ instead of ‘ assist ’ , ‘ about ’ instead of ‘ approximately ’ and ‘ like ’ instead of ‘ such as ’ , it says			2
‘ this is n’t " dumbing down " ' , they are told			2
‘ be open and specific			0
all audiences should understand our content ... this is opening up government information to all			0
’ although recent announcements suggest some departments still have a way to go			2
one from the @entity88 about improvements to the visa system says it will give ‘ the option for key businesses to complete the biometric enrolment part of applications for their staff from within their own offices , a significant service development that has facilitated the investment of nearly £ 2bn into the @entity101			0
’ not a ' one stop shop ' : the online style guide is published on the government website www.gov.uk which has replaced those for individual departments , so all the information the public need is one place another recent announcement from the @entity111 reads : ‘ the government is establishing a @entity113 on impact investment			1
impact investment provides capital to deliver both social and financial results			0
‘ this multi-stakeholder exchange will focus on sharing best practice on ‘ what works ’ in impact investing			0
it will provide a shared platform to debate and create ideas as well as inviting new voices to the field			0
’ but there seems to have some been some improvement since environment department attracted ridicule last year for press notice when began : ‘ the @entity134 on the ‘ @entity135 for implementing the @entity136 for @entity137 ’ released its first findings at ‘ @entity133 ’ of the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) today			0
’ @entity139 , from the @entity138 , said the new rules were welcome after officials have spent years announcing government policies in ‘ departmental gobbledygook ’			0
he said : ‘ the fact that much of this is unintentionally hilarious suggests how bad things had become			0
@entity138 applauds this attempt to encourage clarity , though , and would be happy to assist any government department in this			0

new style guide attempts to slim down jargon in @entity19 announcements
it is deployed on @entity158 *'s* new one - stop - shop website @entity159
guidance should facilitate the delivery of better dialogue with stakeholders
