a snake catcher has shared hilarious images of some of the most bizarre places he has discovered the world 's deadliest creatures			1
for 13 years @entity6 has been removing serpents from unexpected spots such as gyms , wine racks , brothels and even under pillows			1
@entity13 mr @entity6 has relocated around 600 snakes across @entity15 , @entity16 , since founding his company @entity17 24/7 , which operates 24 hours and seven days a week , in february 2014			1
but despite his daring job , mr @entity6 anticipates turning it into a family business with his five - year - old daughter , @entity41 , showing an interest			1
' my family have a healthy respect for venomous snakes and while they would n't touch them , they certainly do not fear them , ' he said			2
' my two eldest girls , @entity52 and @entity41 , absolutely love hearing about my day and will hold non-venomous snakes any chance they get			2
' a red - bellied black snake curled up under a pillow : mr @entity6 anticipates turning it into a family business a 1.5m python loose in @entity61 car ( left ) and a 2.7m long coastal carpet python lifting some weights ( right ) a 1.6m carpet python made itself at home near a toilet : mr @entity6 caught his first snake at five years old mr @entity6 deals with creatures varying from carpet snakes to highly venomous @entity70 , the second-most venomous in the world			1
he added : ' my mum says i was chasing lizards as soon as i could walk			0
' she tells people i caught my first snake , a highly - venomous copperhead , when i was five			2
' we were camping in @entity79 and a friend and i came out of the bush with it in a bucket			0
a snake cuddled up on a wine rack : ' most people think a snake will chase you and bite but that could n't be further from the truth , ' mr @entity6 said a large python helps out in the office ( left ) and a carpet python pictured coming through a door after chasing a cat ( right ) knock , knock : a carpet python waits outside a door ' most people think a snake will chase you and bite but that could n't be further from the truth			1
' they also think they are slimy but they really just feel like finger nails			0
' but that close encounter with disaster did n't deter the boy from the @entity107 from turning his backyard hobby into a career as a qualified snake catcher			1
' a lot of people think it 's a dangerous job but to me , i feel like it 's not dangerous at all , ' mr @entity6 told @entity114			2
mr @entity6 was called to a home this season where he found the large carpet python had devoured chickens ' there are people risking their lives everyday - like electricians or people parachuting and jumping out of planes - to me that 's dangerous but its all relative to risk management			1
' but i 've been doing it for a long time and i ca n't put my finger on what attracted me to them but i have always loved chasing snakes since i was little			2
' and i love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when i catch them			2
' mr @entity6 , who owns the @entity17 24/7 , has been catching snakes since the age of five @entity6 's colleague @entity140 recently removed an eastern brown snake on a job			1
mr @entity6 added : ' it 's the most beautiful one i 've ever seen - it 's orange incase you did n't notice ! ' ' it 's been quite busy during the summer season and i 've been getting a lot of phone calls and text messages for identification or to attend homes to locate and remove snakes if necessary ' , he said			1
despite many years of experience , mr @entity6 said he has never had any training			1
' a lot of people ask me how i 've learnt to catch snakes but i ca n't remember a day where i 'm not catching them – i 've been doing it for a long time and i guess it was just self - taught			1
' growing up , @entity164 played a passion that i had			0
i remember watching his shows and thinking ' that 's what i do too ! ' and it stirred me on from there			0
' he was called to this home in the @entity107 to save a pet cat from this python which was waiting to pounce mr @entity6 has been quite busy during the summer season , with number phone calls and texts daily snake catcher @entity6 came to the rescue when he was called to a home on the @entity107 while mr @entity6 makes his job sound too easy , he said he has had some of the scariest moments			1
' just recently , i did something really stupid – i crawled underneath a home and it was just two foot off the ground to catch an eastern brown snake			2
' crawling on my tummy , trying to locate it which in hind sight – i should n't have done – but when i looked up , it was right above my head , looking at me like ' what are you doing ? ' so i slowly backed out			0
' the owner passed me a pool stick to try and get it out and it dropped to the ground just two metres from my face and looked straight at me in a defence position – it 's what they do when they feel threatened and vulnerable			0
despite many years of experience , mr @entity6 said he has never had any training and was self - taught the family @entity206 alerted the owners when it found a carpet python in its kennel			1
the owners taped up the door to trap it inside the kennel until mr @entity6 arrived to remove it ' it was stupid and dumb – i managed to catch it safely but it was n't the end of it			2
the owner 's @entity206 was coming at me so i had the snake in one hand and trying to scare the dog with my leg – it was crazy			0
' after mr @entity6 catches the reptiles , he releases them back into the wild			1
' we try to release them in the same geographical area and i do n't like to take them too far away from where they were found			0
but it has to be a far distance away so they do n't come back , ' he said			0
' but if it 's a venomous snake , a lot more thought goes into them and we try to release them far away as possible from residential areas			0
' when it doubt about spotting a snake , mr @entity6 suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance the avid snake catcher has been catching snakes at a very young age and has n't stopped since mr @entity6 said the most venomous snakes @entity16 should be aware of at the moment is the eastern brown snakes , which are the second most venomous snakes in the world			1
when it doubt about spotting a snake , @entity6 suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance			2
' send it to us and we can identify it for you and if it 's venomous or not and whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them , ' he said			0
' if the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms , it 's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us			0
' be smart about it because 90 percent of the time , people who are bitten are often trying to kill it or scare it away			0
' all snakes want to do is get away but if it does n't feel it can escape , it 'll strike – so be sensible when you spot them			0
