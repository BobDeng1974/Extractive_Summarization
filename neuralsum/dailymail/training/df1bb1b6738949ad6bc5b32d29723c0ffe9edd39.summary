the prime minister said he wanted to make the ‘ dream of home ownership a reality ’ as lenders braced themselves for a flood of interest in the £ 12 billion help to buy scheme			1
but as the doors opened for homebuyers to get 95 per cent mortgages , there were fresh warnings that it risked causing an uncontrollable housing bubble			0
state - backed banks @entity28 and @entity29 have announced plans to open 740 of its branches for extended hours for two weeks to cope with expected demand			1
in a major boost to the government , @entity33 today became the latest lender to sign up to the scheme			1
@entity38 and @entity28 , owned by the state - backed @entity39 , will start offering loans under the scheme on friday			1
@entity43 and the start - up @entity44 will take part from january , with some estimates suggesting 180,000 loans could eventually be taken out			2
under the scheme the house buyer must find five per cent of the property value as a deposit , the bank will provide a mortgage worth 80 per cent and the government will guarantee the remaining 15 per cent			1
new or old properties worth up to £ 600,000 are eligible , with both first - time buyers and people looking to move up the property ladder able to apply			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ too many hardworking people are finding it impossible to buy their own home - people who can afford the monthly mortgage payments but have n’t got rich parents and ca n’t pay the deposit up front			2
‘ there is a need for @entity68 to act			0
buying your first home is about far more than four walls to sleep at night			0
‘ it ’s somewhere to put down roots and raise a family			0
it ’s an investment for the future			0
above all , it ’s a sign that everything you ’ve put in has been worth it			0
‘ @entity80 is going to make the dream of home ownership a reality for many who would otherwise have been shut out			1
this goes right to the heart of my vision for @entity91 - a country where everyone who works hard can get on in life			0
’ first time buyers have struggled to find a deposit of at least 20 per cent more than 25,000 people bought their first home in july this year , the highest level since november 2007 ministers hope the scheme will trigger a new wave of housebuilding			1
an earlier phase of the scheme , offering 20 per cent loans on new - build properties , has already helped more than 15,000 people buy a new home since it was launched six months ago			2
@entity33 said is planning to offer help to buy mortgages between 90 per cent and 95 per cent loan - to - value ( @entity112 ) later this year through its branch network			1
@entity115 , head of @entity116 , said it promises to beat or match rates from high street competitors at 90 per cent @entity112			0
' by participating in help to buy , we will go further and offer mortgages up to 95 per cent @entity112 , ' he said			0
latest figures show on average first time buyers are offered only 80 per cent mortgages , requiring a deposit of more than £ 30,000			2
but as the new scheme went live , the treasury select committee issued a fresh warning about the impact on the housing market			1
@entity28 , which owns @entity29 , unveils details of its new help to buy mortgages today , although it expects to help only 8,500 a year for the next three years @entity135 chairman @entity134 warned ministers had failed to ‘ allay our concerns ’ about the scheme			1
the @entity140 mp added : ‘ given the chequered history of @entity68 interventions in residential property , great care will need to be taken in both the construction and running of this scheme			0
‘ mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability			1
’ criticism : treasury select committee chairman @entity134 said help to buy could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability ' the committee 's report concludes : ‘ the primary effect of the guarantee scheme , at least in the short to medium - term , could be to raise house prices rather than stimulate new supply			1
‘ furthermore , we continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme , with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the @entity91 mortgage market			2
’ deputy prime minister @entity171 insisted he did not think the scheme would worsen the problem of the ' overheated ' property market in the capital			1
but he suggested the scheme could be ' turned off ' if problems emerged			2
speaking at an event in east @entity179 , he said : ' i do n't believe that this second part of the help to buy scheme is suddenly going to make that escalation in @entity179 prices qualitatively worse , that 's already happening			2
' but - a big but - of course we need to be vigilant , of course we need to moderate it , even turn it off if we think that it is not appropriate and is providing inappropriate stimulation to the housing market ' the guarantees will be available for both new and existing homes worth up to £ 600,000 , and the @entity195 said there would be tough checks to ensure people could afford repayments			0
customers can get information from @entity29 and @entity28 from today and start applying at those banks from tomorrow			1
they are offering two - and five - year fixed rate deals at 4.99 per cent and 5.49 per cent interest rates with no fee			0
the brands together expect to sign up 25,500 first and next time buyers over three years			0
@entity208 , @entity209 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ if ministers are serious about helping first - time buyers , they should bring forward investment to build more affordable homes			0
‘ rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply , but under this government house - building is at its lowest level since the 1920s			0
