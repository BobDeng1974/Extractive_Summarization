by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:04 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:26 est , 27 december 2013 when a father has a hearing aid fitted after years of being deaf , it should be a reason for his son to celebrate			1
but it seems @entity9 was left frustrated by the fact his old man can hear again - so he wrote a song to express his feelings			1
during the ' affectionate ' track , which he wrote for his father as a @entity18 gift , the musician complains he can no longer listen to loud music and is forced to maintain a conversation			1
he then posted a video of the song on his @entity35 page , and has already received more than 700,000 views			2
at one point , the cameraman struggles to hold the camera steady after being overcome by laughter			2
and towards the end of the video , the father says : ' that is going to be an internet classic			1
' underneath the video , mr @entity9 wrote : ' my @entity47 , who has been hard of hearing for about as long as i can remember , recently invested in hearing aids			1
so i wrote him a little song for @entity18 to celebrate his newfound sense , affectionately entitled , " i liked @entity53			1
" the song goes : ' there used to be a time , it was rather recently			2
when i ’d play something on the stereo and mother would say “ @entity9 turn that down ” and you ’d say , “ it ’s already very low ”			1
' it seemed that i could always count on you to come and take my side when i ’d set the volume up at 62 and someone else wanted it at 35			2
' but since you found out that your ears are micable i have to say it ’s made you just a touch less likeable			1
' you never used to know the difference ‘ tween the bass and treble clef , and it is n’t hard to tell you that i like you better deaf			0
' it used to be if i ’d run out of anything to say , i could just mumble and you ’d usually go away			0
' it used to be what i was bringing to the conversation , was subject to a wider range of your interpretation			0
' but now i see that i must be living in a nightmare , why it ’s every son ’s worst fear to have a dad forever clad with supersonic ears			1
and i do n’t mean to tell you that i love you any less but there ’s no doubt about it that i liked you better deaf			0
' if i had once forgot to tell you something , say a chord i had n’t struck like , “ the mail ’s arrived ” “ i owe you five ” “ @entity94 ” or “ @entity95 ! ” follow @entity9 online here making peace : when the song finished , the musician closed his laptop and went over to his father laughing : at the end of the video , @entity9 's father said it would be an ' internet classic ' ' once i could have played it off without blood sweat or tears “ i told you that , ” i ’d tell you , and you ’d blame it on your ears			1
' it once was undetectable but now it ’s ineffectual the odds are insurmountable and i am held accountable			0
' and you never would ’ve noticed if i swore under my breath , now i do n’t have to shout to say i liked you better deaf			0
' see now i ’ve reached a point where it ’s hard to make a rhyme , but the song needs another verse to reach a fitting time			0
' and if i had been writing it for old deaf dad			2
i might have left a phrase or two … unfinished			0
' but only the best for you and your new hearing , you will find that every rhyme is aurally endearing			0
' and i ’m afraid that now you ’ve left me lyrically bereft but i only need five words to say i liked you better deaf			0
