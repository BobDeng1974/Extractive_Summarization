' i was at my darkest point when i got pregnant with @entity20			0
i was the thinnest i had ever been , i was the illest ( sic ) i had ever been			0
' i had this massive guilt every time i ate because the anorexia still had a massive grip on me			0
and then i had massive guilt for not feeding , or not considering feeding my child			0
@entity3 , 21 , has battled anorexia since she was a child			2

she is trying to put weight on to ensure that baby @entity49 is born at a healthy weight when she is induced on monday 5ft 7in @entity3 was eight when she started battling with her weight			1
she blames her condition on the pressure to look skinny in a leotard while taking ballet classes			0

@entity20 weighed 5lb 10oz and , to her relief , was healthy			1
‘ i was so lucky he was ok , ’ she said			0
‘ i felt so guilty i had put his life at risk			0
' miss @entity3 admits that when she was told that she was pregnant with her first child @entity20 she was terrified			1
she said she should have been over the moon but was upset she would not longer be able to control her weight miss @entity3 ( pictured with fiance @entity70 after the birth of @entity20 ) was so small that when @entity20 was in her womb he cracked her rib and started to crush her lungs			1
because of this she was induced at 37 weeks miss @entity3 is pictured looking a slightly healthier weight while on holiday with her partner @entity76			1
miss @entity3 goes into periods of remission but is prone to relapses			0
now , at 34 weeks pregnant , she has been battling to gain weight before she gives birth to her daughter , who she will name @entity43 , despite the severe morning sickness that saw her lose 18lb in the earlier stages			1
normally , pregnant women are expected to consume about 2,000 calories a day but @entity3 , who is engaged to the child 's father , gym manager @entity87 , 24 , makes do with between 800 and 1,200 , eating one slice of toast for breakfast , salad for lunch , and plain pasta for dinner			2
@entity3 , from @entity96 , @entity97 said : ‘ i suffered terrible morning sickness which caused my weight to drop , triggering my anorexia			1
' i had thoughts of purging but did n’t need to , my body was reacting in its own way			0
this made eating a lot easier , because i would just vomit it up anyway			0
’ ' i lost a massive amount of weight and then got put on a strict eating plan - nothing rich , spicy or creamy , i needed very simple , basic foods to stop me being sick			0
' miss @entity3 ( pictured , left , age six ) developed anorexia when she was eight after ballet classes put pressure on her to lose weight			2
she has fought the condition for years and has gained a healthy weight for short periods of time			0
in summer last year she relapsed ( right ) and plummeted to seven stone despite being 5 ' 7 " psychologist @entity28 who appeared on the show with @entity3 and hosts @entity123 and @entity124 said : ' the natural inclination to wish to starve oneself is always present in the mentality of any anorexic			2
' but what @entity3 's situation shows is that with intensive therapy and treatment and a belief system that becomes a positive one i.e. i have got to feed this child , the pregnancy can continue and you can have a healthy baby			2
also the learning experience in that is that if you put your mind to it you can continue that behaviour and then in the long - term overcome this disorder			0
' @entity3 is carrying a girl that she has named @entity146 ( pictured here in her 20 - week scan )			2
doctors says the baby is doing well and is healthy despite her mother 's low weight @entity3 has had to see a high - risk maternity doctor , throughout her pregnancy and a 4d scan of the child shows she currently looks healthy			1
@entity3 said : ' i 'm not better yet but having @entity20 kept me eating three meals a day and kept me from really relapsing or regressing			0
in the future i 'm going back to treatment and i hope to kick it for good , it 's really important for me to be able to be something that my kids want to emulate			0
' i ’m desperate to recover so i can teach my kids a healthy way to approach food			0
' i could n’t bear it if they had body issues like me , so i ’m continuing to fight the voices in my head and get better for them			0
