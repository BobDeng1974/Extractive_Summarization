by @entity0 last updated at 8:56 am on 30th december 2011 on @entity5 the first of two @entity3 moon probes , @entity4 , will go into orbit around the moon			0
its twin , @entity4 , will follow on @entity10			0
the $ 496 million mission has taken three months to reach the moon - travelling two million miles			1
the @entity3 team said they will not celebrate @entity5 's are both in orbit			0
' we 're on our way there , ' said @entity19 of the @entity20			0
the washing - machine - sized grail craft are to ' map ' the interior of the moon by scanning its gravity field - measured by its effects on the flight paths of the the two craft			1
@entity30 published this year suggested that @entity31 once had dual moons that collided and formed the moon people gaze at today			2
@entity3 's grail spacecraft will fire their engines to move into orbit on @entity5 and @entity10 - the twin probes will eventually orbit at just 35 miles up and will ' map ' the moon 's gravity by measuring its effects on their flight paths the pair will fly in formation at an altitude of 34 miles ( 54.72 kilometers ) above the surface , 124 miles apart			1
the effects of the moon 's uneven gravity on the probes will allow @entity3 to form a picture of what is under the surface			1
it 's a mission that @entity3 described as a ' journey to the centre of the moon ' , and will map the moon 's interior 100 to 1000 times more accurately than any previous moon mission			1
@entity64 probes - short for @entity4 - will spend the next two months tweaking their positions before they start collecting data in march			0
the mission ’s chief scientist , @entity67 of the @entity69 , said ' we actually know more about @entity71 - than we do about our own moon			1
' one puzzle scientists hope to solve is why the moon ’s far side is more hilly than the side that always faces @entity31			0
@entity3 aims to ' map ' the interior of the moon to understand its past - research published earlier this year suggested that @entity31 once had dual moons that collided and formed the moon that people gaze at today the twin spacecraft have been travelling to the moon since launching from the @entity88 coast in september - a leisurely journey over a distance that took the @entity92 astronauts just three days			1
' both spacecraft have performed essentially flawlessly since launch , but one can never take anything for granted in this business , ' said mission chief scientist @entity67 of the @entity69			1
engineers said the chances of the probes overshooting are slim since their trajectories have been precise			0
but things could still go wrong			0
cosmic rays might interfere with the probes ' engine burn and they wo n’t get boosted into the right orbit			0
' i know i ’m going to be nervous , ' said project manager @entity19 of @entity3 ’s @entity20 , which manages the $ 496 million , three - month mission			0
the twin grail probes have been travelling to the moon since september - a journey that took the @entity92 astronauts just three days			2
the probes launched on a smaller rocket to keep costs down once in orbit , the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles			2
data collection will begin in march			0
previous missions have attempted to measure lunar gravity with mixed success			2
grail is the first mission dedicated to this goal			0
as the probes circle the moon , regional changes in the lunar gravity field will cause them to speed up or slow down			2
this in turn will change the distance between them			0
radio signals transmitted by the spacecraft will measure the slight distance gaps , allowing researchers to map the underlying gravity field			2
once in orbit , the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles using the gravity information , scientists can deduce what ’s below or at the lunar surface such as mountains and craters and may help explain why the far side of the moon is more rugged than the side that faces @entity31			1
spectators on the north coast of @entity161 observing in awe as the @entity164 rocket launches towards space the probes are officially known as grail - a and @entity168 months ago , @entity3 hosted a contest inviting schools and students to submit new names			0
the probes will be christened with the winning names after the second orbit insertion , @entity67 said			0
' grail , simply put , is a journey to the centre of the moon ' said @entity178 , head of @entity3 's science mission			2
spectacular : a huge moon - shaped ball of smoke is produced as the @entity164 rocket lifts off lead scientist , @entity67 said of the mission , ' it will probe the interior of the moon and map its gravity field 100 to 1,000 times better than ever before			1
we will learn more about the interior of the moon with @entity4 than all previous lunar missions combined , ' @entity178 said			1
@entity67 , the grail mission 's principal investigator and a planetary scientist at the @entity69 , said the precise lunar gravity measurements will help her and other planetary scientists better understand how the moon evolved over the past 4 billion years			1
the findings also should help identify the composition of the moon 's core : whether it 's made of solid iron or possibly titanium oxide			1
another puzzle that @entity4 may help solve , @entity67 said , is whether @entity31 once had a smaller second moon			0
astronomers have speculated that some of the ' landmarks ' on the moon 's surface are a result of a collision with a second , smaller moon			1
knowing where the moon 's gravity is stronger will enable the @entity220 and other countries to better pinpoint landing locations for future explorers , whether robot or human			1
the gravity on the moon is uneven and about one - sixth @entity31 's pull			1
' if you want to land right next to a particular outcrop ( of rock ) , you 're going to be able to do it			0
there will be no reason to do another gravity experiment of the moon in any of our lifetimes			2
' sparks fly as the @entity164 begins its take - off ( left ) before catapulting into the sky ahead of its four - month journey @entity67 said the grail findings should eliminate cliffhangers like the @entity244 landing in 1969 by @entity245 and @entity246			0
they overshot their touchdown site in part because of the subtle gravity changes in the moon 's surface below ; they almost ran out of fuel before safely touching down on the @entity255 .			1

' we actually know more about @entity71 than we do about our own moon , ' says chief scientist
window into moon 's 4 - billion - year *history* - was there once a second moon ?
will map interior of moon by *sensing* its gravity
could help future missions land on surface
