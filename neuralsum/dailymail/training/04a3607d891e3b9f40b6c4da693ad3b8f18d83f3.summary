by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 13:11 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 11 july 2013 the president and ceo of the railway 's parent company says an employee failed to properly set the brakes of the train that crashed into a town in @entity11 , killing at least 15 people while another 45 remain missing			1
@entity13 made the comments during a visit wednesday to the town that was devastated by the runaway oil train four days ago			1
' it was questionable whether hand brakes were put i place at this time , ' @entity13 said			2
' i do n't think any employees removed brakes			2
they failed to set the brakes			2
' ' i think he did something wrong ... we think he applied some hand brakes but the question is did he apply enough of them			2
' he said he applied 11 hand brakes we think that 's not true			2
initially we believed him but now we do n't			0
the company president made the announcement about the brakes today as well in memory : a makeshift memorial is set up , as much of the town is still struggling with the possibility that 60 people died in the crash			1
the lack of bodies hints that they may have vaporized in the heat he said a train engineer has been suspended without pay			1
all told , 15 bodies have been found but they are so badly burned that they are unidentifiable			1
that number does not include the 15 people whose bodies were burnt so badly that they are unidentifiable , bringing the total number up to 60			1
@entity13 said that he had stayed in @entity76 to deal with the crisis in his office , where he was better able to communicate with insurers and officials in different places during what he described as 20 - hour work days			0
at a press conference , shortly before @entity13 was due to arrive in @entity84 , @entity11 premier @entity85 faulted the company 's response in the wake of the disaster			1
' we have realized there are serious gaps from the railway company from not having been there and not communicating with the public , ' @entity85 said			0
she also announced a $ 60million fund to help victims in @entity84 and to rebuild the town			1
@entity13 visited the devastated town a day after police announced they were pursuing a painstaking , wide - ranging criminal investigation of the inferno ignited by the derailment of the oil train that demolished the center of this lakeside town of 6,000			1
flanked by reporters at @entity110 's @entity109 airport tuesday evening , @entity13 suggested firefighters who extinguished an earlier fire on the same train shared some of the blame			1
long road ahead : rescue workers comb the debris for evidence of survivors following the huge train crash on saturday which devastated the small town of @entity84 in @entity11 ' we have responsibility for this incident			1
we do n't have total responsibility but we have partial responsibility , ' @entity13 said in remarks broadcast on @entity129			0
@entity11 police inspector @entity130 announced wednesday morning that the number of missing had risen to 60 , a number that included the 15 bodies recovered so far that have been burnt beyond recognition			1
police had earlier put the number of missing at 50			1
mr @entity130 said the numbers remained in flux as reports of missing people trickled in or people believed to be missing turned out to be alive			1
mr @entity130 had earlier ruled out terrorism as a cause , but said that an array of other possibilities remain under investigation , including criminal negligence			0
other officials have raised the possibility that the train was tampered with before the crash early saturday			1
debris : terrorism has been ruled out as a possible cause but there is still a criminal investigation underway shells : @entity160 cars are seen near the train wreckage which was traveling far too fast when it went off the rails , investigators told reporters on tuesday ' we 're not at the stage of arrests			2
' the heart of the town 's central business district is being treated as a crime scene and remained cordoned off by police tape - not only the 30 buildings razed by the fire but also many adjacent blocks			2
on downtown 's main street - rue de laval - police positioned a truck near the perimeter of the no - go zone , which prevented news crews from getting direct photo and video views of the search operations being conducted by some 200 officers			0
police officials left no doubt that the hunt for the missing people was taxing - they said two officers were withdrawn from the sector because of worries about their physical condition			1
' this is a very risky environment , ' said @entity196 sgt. @entity195			0
' we have to secure the safety of those working there			0
we have some hotspots on the scene			0
' the @entity207 train broke loose early saturday and hurtled downhill through the darkness nearly seven miles ( 11 kilometers ) before jumping the tracks at 63 mph ( 101 kph ) in @entity84 , in eastern @entity11 near the @entity211 border , investigators said			1
all but one of the 73 cars were carrying oil			1
still standing : the @entity215 stands unscathed next to the derailment and blast site vast devastation : a police officer walks amongst axle gear and the battered tankers which careered downhill desolate : burnt down houses and cars are seen near the train wreckage where 40 people remain unaccounted for amid fears that their bodies may have vaporized in the extreme heat @entity230 : @entity160 cars are seen near the train wreckage in @entity84 on saturday			1
the crude oil freight train derailed and blew up causing residents to run for their lives rail dispatchers had no chance to warn anyone during the runaway train 's 18 - minute journey because they did n't know it was happening themselves , @entity237 officials said			1
such warning systems are in place on busier lines but not on secondary lines , said tsb manager @entity248			0
at the center of the destruction is the @entity251 , a popular bar that was filled at the time of the explosion , which also forced about 2,000 of the town 's 6,000 residents from their homes			2
by tuesday , only about 800 were still barred from returning to their houses , though residents were cautioned to boil tap water before drinking it			0
efforts continued to stop waves of crude oil spilled in the disaster from reaching the @entity267 , the backbone of the province 's water supply			1
investigators searching for a cause of the accident are looking closely at the fire that happened on the train less than an hour before it got loose while parked in the nearby town of @entity277			1
carnage : emergency workers are seen at the site of the train wreckage in the small @entity284 - @entity283 town close to @entity110 smouldering : a single column of a building still stands as the rest of the structure has been reduced to rubble around it the train 's engine was shut down - standard operating procedure dictated by the train 's owners , @entity277 fire chief @entity291 said			1
@entity13 suggested that shutting off the locomotive to put out the fire might have disabled the brakes			0
' the train had the engine shut down by the firemen , they did n't do that for malicious purposes by it 's what happens , ' @entity13 told reporters at the @entity110 airport			2
' the firemen should have roused the locomotive engineer who was in his hotel and taken him to the scene with them			0
but it 's easy to say what should have happened			0
we 're dealing with what happened			0
' @entity291 defended the fire department , saying that the blaze was extinguished within about 45 minutes and that 's when firefighters ' involvement ended			2
the accident has thrown a spotlight on @entity207 's safety record : over the past decade , the company has consistently recorded a much higher accident rate than the national average in the @entity327 , according to data from the @entity329			0
last year , for instance , the railroad had 36.1 accidents per million miles traveled by its trains			0
the national average for 2012 was 14.6			0
crushed : the tankers may have been tampered with , transport officials said on tuesday fearing the worst : exhausted firefighters take a much - needed break on a set of train wheels as they worked to recover the now 45 suspected missing residents before the @entity84 accident , the company had 34 derailments since 2003 , according to the federal agency			1
over that period , the company was involved in five accidents that had reportable damage of more than $ 100,000			0
the severity of those incidents , however , is difficult to determine from the federal agency 's 10 - year data overviews on railroad safety			0
but before the weekend accident , incidents involving the company 's trains had resulted in just one death			0
that 2006 accident involved a vehicle that struck a moving train at a highway crossing			2
@entity13 said the figures were misleading			0
' this is the only significant mainline derailment this company has had in the last 10 years			0
we 've had , like most railroads , a number of smallish incidents , usually involving accidents in yard trackage and industry trackage , ' he told the @entity375			0
hard choices : emergency personnel look over the debris from a runaway train as a crane removes some of the destruction melded : piles of destroyed cars are heaped together showing the force of the explosion nonetheless , @entity13 predicted the accident would lead to changes in the way railways operate , and indicated that @entity207 would no longer leave loaded trains unattended , a practice he said was standard in the industry			2
the tanker cars involved in the crash were the @entity395 - a staple of the @entity327 freight rail fleet whose flaws have been noted as far back as a 1991 safety study			0
experts say the @entity403 's steel shell is so thin that it is prone to puncture in an accident , potentially spilling cargo that can catch fire , explode or contaminate the environment .			2

15 dead but unidentified because of bad burns after train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded on saturday after several tankers came loose
town of @entity84 in @entity11 was *engulfed* in a *massive* inferno
45 people missing as experts say they may have been vaporized in blast
