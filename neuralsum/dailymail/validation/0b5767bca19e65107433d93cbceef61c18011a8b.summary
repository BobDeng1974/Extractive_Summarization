@entity0 and @entity1 have been making headlines for rocking latex this year but they 're not the first - and the wo n't be the last - to show off the risque look			1
once the sartorial statement of choice in sex clubs , latex , pvc and wet - look leather has been treated to a high fashion makeover but can real women pull off the skin - tight look ? or do you need the body - and the confidence - of an a-lister to wear it ? @entity19 called on the designer behind @entity0 and @entity1 's famous looks to custom design a latex dress from scratch for one of our writers - who says she 's never felt more confident			1
@entity51 , judging by the catwalks at fashion week , it will be filling our wardrobes in months to come , so @entity30 , our 26 - year - old writer , was in safe hands			2
@entity30 , who is a size 12 , visited @entity33 's studio in @entity58 , north @entity59 , for a fitting - as while her designs can be bought off the rack ( something @entity1 does ) , @entity33 recommends that she fits all of her clients either in person or online			1
after being measured , @entity30 tried on a variety of colours - from peach to black - and differing styles , to see which she felt most comfortable in			0
' it 's a really personal experience , ' explains the brand 's managing director , @entity71			0
' latex is perfect for a special moment and it 's all about feeling and looking great in it			0
you have to commit to putting in the time to get a fitting so that the final outfit looks like it 's painted on			0
' @entity30 and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch and had to use lubricant to slip into the dress for the final shoot @entity30 said that maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket , she could reduce the focus of her top half for a night out on the town @entity30 and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch			1
the process involves gluing the latex together to the customer 's precise measurements and requirements			2
explaining the experience , @entity30 said : ' at the fitting , @entity33 and the team brought out a few options for me to try , but at first they did n’t take my measurements rather took a look at me and gauged which size would fit			1
' clearly they have a good eye for it as the dresses actually fitted very well on the body , though they had to make my bust size and cup bigger ( just like @entity0 ! )			2
' i definitely needed a hand putting on the dress , and the stylist put talc on the inside of the dress so it could slip on better			0
i say slip , but that was n’t the case as there was a lot of pulling and squeezing to make sure the seams were lined up and there was n’t any ridges in the latex			0
' once i stepped out and saw myself i had to admit , it was a pretty " wow " moment			0
i do have some lumps and bumps but the dress really streamlined it and i really get why @entity0 is such a fan			1
i actually really liked the black dress with the plunging neckline , because as a woman with a bust , it ’s hard to wear that sort of cut without accidentally suffering a nipple slip ! thanks to the tight latex there was no danger of that			2
' it ’s amazing how 15 minutes in the dress can become rather hot work and after trying on three , i did feel thoroughly flushed			0
hats off to @entity151 who rocked an @entity33 latex dress for her energetic concert recently ! '			1
@entity33 takes @entity30 's measurements in her @entity58 boutique is that @entity0 ? writer @entity30 is proof that you do n't have to be a reality star or celebrity to look sensational - and super stylish - in skintight latex and a few days later , @entity30 received her bespoke design			1
' finally putting on the custom - made dress was amazing , ' said @entity30 , of the final shoot			1
' it fitted perfectly to my shape and bust size but i would probably need a hand to get it on in the first place - and maybe when i visit the ladies ' room			0
' the great thing about the latex is that once it 's in position , it does streamline your figure			0
' @entity0 probably has more confidence to wear such a cleavage - enhancing dress on the town than me , but maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket i could reduce the focus of my top half for a night out			1
' i probably would n't wear it to go dancing in			0
it does get a little hot under the latex and i doubt @entity0 would be seen with a sweat on			2
' while @entity30 opted for a copy @entity0 look , @entity33 emphasises that you do n't necessarily have to wear head - to - toe latex			1
she said : ' i make accessories , millinery , shorts and skirts so you can mix and match			0
' @entity33 first discovered the fabric when she was at fashion college in @entity198 20 years ago			2
she was tasked with finding a quirky material on the high street and ventured into a sex shop and from that day made it her mission to create clothes using latex			2
@entity30 , 26 , tries out a skintight latex cocktail dress with cap sleeves and plunging v - neck in @entity33 's shop @entity30 is measured for her bespoke , strappy , cleavage - enhancing latex dress , which is just like @entity0 's after moving to @entity59 , she started brand her eponymous brand in 2000 and was credited with being the first designer to offer a feminine take on latex			1
her work quickly got picked up by @entity42 and iconic photographer @entity218 used four pages of @entity220 wearing the fabric in @entity222 in 2007			0
' that was such a moment , ' recalled @entity71			0
' it looked so great and sexy on her ; that was the real turning point			0
' other stars were quickly recognising the brand and @entity33 was dressing @entity229 non-stop from 2008			1
@entity33 dressed her when she was supporting @entity231 on tour , as well as for most of her music videos , including telephone with @entity235 , who she also dressed			2
@entity0 and @entity1 showed up to a party earlier this year in near - identical latex dresses by @entity33 ... and they 're just two of the stars jumping on the bandwagon @entity30 tried on @entity1 and @entity0 's favourite blush - coloured latex shade too at the shop before finally settling on the black option , which better suited her skin tone and hair colour another major moment came when for the brand when @entity229 asked @entity33 to dress her for her meeting with the @entity250 , who the designer cites as her ' dream client '			1
' i would love to dress the queen in a latex suit , a colourful one - with a hat			1
' on a standard week day , @entity41 and @entity1 may ' rock up ' at the brand 's shop in @entity58 , and @entity0 may well be unveiling more looks in the coming months			1
@entity71 said : ' she tends to save her latex looks for special moments			0
it divides opinion but , overall , because @entity0 is so curvy , it has made a lot of curvier women think " if she is wearing it , then i am going to give it a go "			2
' she is the first iconic figure for some time in fashion who has had real curves			0
and @entity276 certainly likes her in it			0
' @entity0 has long championed the material and made headlines when she wore a look by same the designer back in november for a fragrance launch in @entity283 , left , and to watch husband @entity276 perform , right mrs @entity276 is n't the only celebrity to wear @entity286 designs : the elaborate red dress @entity229 wore to meet @entity288 in 2009 was created by the designer @entity151 wore one of the designs on stage at her recent gig - and proved you can jump around in it @entity296 , @entity297 , left , @entity41 , centre , and singer @entity299 , right , have all trailed the trend ( although some looks are more daring than others )			1

@entity1 , @entity229 and @entity41 love designs by @entity33
@entity33 custom - made a latex dress for our writer , just like she did for @entity0
involves a detailed fitting and lots of lubricant
@entity33 has her sights set on dressing the @entity250 in rubber suit
