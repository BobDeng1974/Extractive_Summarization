by @entity0 last updated at 6:49 pm on 25th january 2012 brain cells damaged by @entity2 's have been created for the first time , offering hope to dementia patients			1
it is believe that the breakthrough could help scientists better understand how the degenerative condition affects the the nervous system , prompting more effective treatment			2
@entity2 's is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses , leading to gradual memory loss and difficulties with language and emotions			1
brain cells damaged by @entity2 's have been created for the first time and until now investigations have been limited to ' non-neuronal human cells ' or ' animal models '			1
however a team from the @entity23 have developed a way of growing human cells			1
currently there is no cure for @entity2 ’s disease , but medication is available that can slow down its development			1
during the research skin cells from two patients with a rare inherited form of @entity2 's were taken and used to create neurons displaying biochemical hallmarks of the disease			1
lead researcher professor @entity37 , said : ' creating highly purified and functional human @entity2 's neurons in a dish - this has never been done before			1
' it 's a first step			2
these are n't perfect models			2
they 're proof of concept			0
but now we know how to make them			0
' it requires extraordinary care and diligence , really rigorous quality controls to induce consistent behaviour , but we can do it			0
' prof @entity37 highlighted in the paper , published in the journal nature , that differences between a healthy neuron and an @entity2 's neuron are subtle			1
but being able to grow @entity2 's neurons will help scientists to better understand how the nervous system is impacted and which drugs would be most effective			1
he added : ' we need to do everything we can because the cost of this disease is just too heavy and horrible to contemplate			0
' without solutions , it will bankrupt us - emotionally and financially			0
' further research is now underway			0
he said : ' we 're dealing with the human brain			0
you ca n't just do a biopsy on living patients			0
' instead , researchers have had to work around , mimicking some aspects of the disease in			0
neither approach is really satisfactory			0
' alzheimer 's disease is the most common form of dementia , which is a group of symptoms associated with a decline in mental abilities , such as memory and reasoning and is most common in people aged over 65			1
it attacks nerves , brain cells and neurotransmitters ( chemicals that carry messages to and from the brain )			2
dementia affects around 570,000 people in @entity98 , with alzheimer ’s disease responsible for around 60 per cent of all cases .			2

cells damaged by @entity2 's created for first time
hoped discovery will enable better understanding of dementia
