the pair , who a year ago had never even met , were doing only their third competitive downhill run together and marked the occasion by claiming silver			2
it got @entity13 's @entity22 off to a flying start and ensured that less than an hour into day one they had already exceeded their medal haul from four years ago in @entity26			1
the pair became the first @entity29 women ever to win a @entity12 skiing medal , their rise all the more remarkable given how little time they had to build a partnership			2
it was only last april that they first got to know each other , august they first skied competitively together and january this year they first competed as a pair in a downhill			0
the duo did not even get a training run on friday because the session was cancelled , but @entity6 said : ' i actually was really happy there was no training run , because personally i feel if you 're going to be scared for your life you might as well get a result at the end of it			2
' and the @entity53 athlete did just that , finishing in one minute 34.28 seconds , 2.73secs behind @entity56 winner @entity55			0
she crashed as she crossed the line , but was unhurt , with the medal joy more than making up for the bruises			1
' we had a good run despite my crash at the end			0
i think i was just so happy to go through the line that i could n't stop in time			2
i was aiming for the finish line , saying " go , go , go " and listening to @entity7			1
i hope i have done @entity67 proud , ' she told @entity68			1
ouch : @entity6 crashed at the finishing line but was ok shocking : but fearless @entity6 was n't worried about any potential penalties sliding : @entity6 's ski pops off as she crashes into the barrier at the finish ok : people rush to help the skier , who was unharmed after the crash flying star : @entity6 was back on her feet and on the podium with guide @entity7 ( left ) ' i was so happy i 'd finished and then could n't stop i was going that fast , ' she said			1
her achievement drew praise from prime minister @entity88 , who tweeted : ' proud of @entity6 , who won silver in the women 's visually impaired downhill in @entity15			1
' @entity6 , who celebrates her 23rd birthday on sunday , is visually impaired and communicates with @entity95 down the course via radio			1
she admitted she was surprised by how quickly the duo had flourished			0
@entity95 , who is 19 , added : ' it 's basically a friendship so you have to build a friendship and that can take years			2
' in our case we had to build it within a short space of time , but we were really honest with each other from the beginning			2
' she taught me so much about guiding , i just went with what she said and it 's worked			0
it 's come together now and we 're so happy			0
' and things should only get better over the coming week , with four more events to come , including the super-g , in which @entity6 won bronze at last year 's @entity121 , with a different guide			1
high praise : prime minister @entity88 congratulated @entity6 on twitter ace : @entity6 , along with her guide @entity7 , managed a silver medal in @entity15 birthday girl : the silver medallist will celebrate on sunday job done : @entity6 was delighted with her triumph and hoped she 'd done @entity13 proud team - mate @entity135 and guide @entity136 were also grateful for four more chances after they could only manage sixth place			1
@entity140 , who was in tears , said : ' i am the blubbering wreck , but our communication was awesome and we have no excuse			0
you can see my disappointment , but we will come back fighting			0
' gutted : @entity135 was devastated after finishing in sixth disappointment : @entity67 sit - skier @entity149 crashed out on the ' bumpy course ' @entity13 have not won a @entity22 medal on since the @entity152 in 1994			1
@entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 won individual bronze medals in alpine skiing categories			0
sit - skier @entity149 also suffered disappointment after crashing out on the ' bumpy course '			1
' i think i got the line slightly wrong , it was so bumpy and i just popped out , " said @entity149 , who was unhurt			1
' i wanted to win , it just was n't my day			0
it is challenging snow and it is bumpy in places , certainly where i crashed that was bumpy			2
spectacular : @entity172 @entity171 crashed on the run later in the day and had to be airlifted to hospital ouch : @entity171 is carried down the slope by medical staff in @entity15 ' i do n't think it was unsafe , but it was definitely challenging			0
this is an extreme downhill			0
' ' everyone was like , ' it 's so dangerous ' , but it 's a downhill			0
' the course , which has come in for criticism in the build - up for its " slushy snow " , did appear to deteriorate as the day went on , though			0
@entity172 @entity171 crashed spectacularly in the final event of the morning , the men 's sitting , and had to be airlifted from the slopes			2
