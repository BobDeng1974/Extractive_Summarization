smokers will no longer be allowed to spark up in the playgrounds of one @entity3 park after a trial smoking ban was introduced for a year			1
the initiative , which is likely to now be extended to other outdoor public spaces , was introduced over the weekend as part of an official campaign cut smoking deaths in @entity10			1
smoking is already technically banned in all inside public places in @entity10 , including cafes , restaurants , stations and museums			1
now the three playgrounds in the @entity35 , southern @entity3 , are off limits to smokers for the next 12 months			0
@entity3 deputy mayor @entity37 said breaches would be punished with a yet to be introduced system of formal warnings and fines			2
' for now , we 're focussing more on persuading people than on punishing them , ' she was quoted as saying by the @entity44			0
after the trial , the city authorities ' will determine whether the measure should be made permanent and extended to other @entity3 parks , ' ms @entity45 said			0
the decision to begin the process of banning smoking in the public parks of @entity3 comes after the mayor of @entity56 capital @entity55 , a rival metropolis which competes with @entity3 in standards wealth , culture and opportunity , called similar proposals ' bossy and nannying '			1
@entity63 set himself at odds with a health panel he set up after it recommended thousands of acres of @entity55 parkland and landmarks including @entity69 should go smoke free			1
' this idea in my view , as a libertarian conservative , comes down too much on the side of bossiness and nannying , ' said mr @entity63			0
' one feature of life in @entity55 is that we are a city that allows people to get on with their lives within the law provided they are not harming anyone else			1
' i think smoking is a scourge and it 's right to discourage it ( but ) i am very sceptical at the moment			2
' ' @entity90 and nannying ' : @entity55 mayor @entity63 , left , said he opposed bringing in a similar ban , which was first announced by @entity3 mayor @entity93 , right , as a way of ' teaching people about cigarette addiction ' @entity3 's outdoor smoking ban was first announced in july by @entity93 , the city 's @entity99 mayor , who said the move would be an experiment aimed at ' teaching people about cigarette addiction '			1
perhaps mindful of the massive opposition that there will be to the move in a country where some 30 per cent of the country still smoke , ms @entity93 insisted that her ' experiment ' would not be strictly enforced			2
' we are not into banning , we are experimenting , ' said ms @entity93 , who said parks in the unfashionable 14th arrondissement , where @entity35 is located , would act as ' guinea pigs in this experiment '			0
the move follows a new @entity99 directive which allows bosses to ban wine in the work place – leading to accusations that the very heart of @entity124 culture is under attack			0
traditionally liberal @entity126 are renowned the world over for sitting outside smoking and drinking as they discuss the arts and philosophy			0
tobacco - related illnesses are a leading cause of death in @entity10 , with an estimated 73,000 deaths annually			2
despite massive taxes on cigarette sales , health warnings , and every more stringent bans , the country still has some 16million smokers .			0

smoking is already banned inside cafés , restaurants and stations in @entity10
but terraces and outdoor places are not included in the smoking ban
officials head off *backlash* by insisting *rules* will not be enforced too strictly
@entity55 's mayor has already *binned* a ban , calling it ' bossy and nannying '
