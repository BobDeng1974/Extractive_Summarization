a man who has hiccuped constantly has received the devastating news there is probably no cure and he could have them for life			1
@entity6 , 38 , spoke out last year to appeal for help in finding the cause of his chronic hiccups			1
now , he has been diagnosed with the neurological condition multiple sclerosis and believes the illness could be responsible for his hiccups			1
he has to sleep in a separate room to his wife , is embarrassed about going anywhere in public and struggles to eat normally			0
he said : ‘ they ’ve taken over my life and i do n’t know if i ’ll ever get rid of them			2
‘ now i ’ve been diagnosed with @entity27 i think that ’s the reason for them			1
‘ they are not a common symptom of @entity27 but @entity27 can affect your brain in lots of different ways			1
‘ i ’m told i ’ve got a high burden of the disease and this is the only symptom so far , so i ca n’t complain			0
mr @entity6 has tried every trick that could possibly stop his hiccups but nothing has worked mr @entity6 ( pictured eating sugar and vinegar in a bid to stop his hiccups ) has recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis			1
he believes the neurological condition is responsible for his hiccups ‘ but @entity27 is a progressive disease so i do n’t know if i ’ll ever be cured of them			1
’ mr @entity6 ’s hiccups began in july 2011 after he went on a stag do			1
he said : ‘ i just woke up with them and i ’ve no idea why they started			0
what is @entity27 ? @entity27 is a neurological condition that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord			1
it causes a wide range of symptoms including problems with muscle movement , balance and vision			0
each nerve fibre in the brain is surrounded by a layer of protein called myelin which protects the nerve and helps signal from the brain travel to the body			0
in @entity27 this fibre becomes damaged disrupting these nerve signals			1
usually , people with @entity27 have flare - ups of symptoms for a few days to a few months followed by periods of few symptoms			1
after about 15 years , half of patients then develop secondary progressive @entity27 in which symptoms gradually worsen over time			1
there is currently no cure but treatments can help control the symptoms			2
@entity27 is an autoimmune condition which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the myelin covering of nerves			1
@entity27 is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 and life expectancy is five to 10 years less than in the population as a whole			1
source : @entity96 ms and hiccups : some experts believe the damage that occurs to the central nervous system as a result of @entity27 can result in the body losing its ability to control hiccups			1
but , it is a rare way for @entity27 to present - one study suggested about eight per cent of @entity27 patients struggle with hiccups			1
‘ i ’m not a big drinker and i ’d had more than i ’d for some time but it was nothing out of the ordinary			0
‘ since then i ’ve tried just about everything - all the old wives ’ cures - but i ca n’t stop			2
‘ some days are bad and i ’ll have difficulty eating and keeping my food down			0
‘ other times they lock up my diaphragm and i wo n’t be able to breathe for 30 seconds			0
‘ i spend most nights in a different room from @entity15 so she is not disturbed but that ’s not ideal and it puts a strain on things			0
‘ i can be lying there for hours , hiccupping every three seconds			0
’ mr @entity6 is currently seeing a neurologist who has prescribed chlorpromazine , a drug normally used to treat schizophrenics			1
that has failed to stop the hiccups - but appears to have reduced them to a regular on - off pattern			1
he said : ‘ i ’ll have them for seven or eight days and then they ’ll suddenly stop and i ’ll be without them for five or six days and i ’ll be perfectly fine			2
‘ it ’s been like that for several months now and i do n’t know if it ’s because of the drug			0
‘ i ’ve got another appointment with the neurologist in a couple of weeks when he says he ’s going to put me on an anti-epilepsy drug to see how i react to that			0
‘ there ’s also the possibility of having a pacemaker fitted in my diaphragm which would interrupt the signal from my brain and hopefully stop them			2
’ despite the problem , mr @entity6 says he has been able to keep his job as a software worker with @entity159			1
he spends a couple of days a week in their @entity162 office and the rest of the time at home in @entity166 , @entity167			0
he said : ‘ my work colleagues are very good and very tolerant and i do everything i can to keep the hiccups quiet			2
‘ i find i can control them best and hold my breath if i ’m not talking so i try to keep quiet			0
‘ people find it quite funny when they first meet me but then it becomes quite annoying for someone to have to listen to			0
‘ i to try to keep cheerful but the medical community does n’t seem to know what to do for me			0
mr @entity6 ( pictured with his wife , @entity15 , and children , @entity181 and @entity182 ) believes that as there is no cure for @entity27 he could have his hiccups for the rest of his life ‘ i ’m told there ’s only a handful of people in the world at this moment who will have hiccups as bad			1
’ mr @entity6 - father to @entity181 , four , and 20 - month - old @entity182 - has seen a number of experts , had two endoscopies , a ct scan , changed his diet , taken tranquilisers and consulted a chiropractor but all in vain			2
his wife , @entity15 , 39 , said : ‘ it ’s a big struggle			0
‘ i try to block it out but i ca n’t sleep with it - the sound and the constant twitching of the bed			0
‘ even when he ’s having a good week it ’s hard having him back in the bed because i ’ve got used to sleeping by myself			0
‘ it is very tough on him and day to day he ’s not very happy , although he tries to remain positive			0
‘ it ’s difficult for anyone to concentrate on anything else when he ’s around			0
‘ we are still desperate to find someone who can help him because the hiccups are ruining our lives			2
’ @entity222 , information resources manager , at the @entity224 said : ' people with @entity27 can experience chronic hiccups , which may be caused by having @entity27 , but this link is n’t proven			1
' no two cases of @entity27 are the same and the condition can present itself with a wide range of different symptoms			2
' we wish @entity6 and his family all the best for the future and would encourage him to get in touch if he would like and support or further information about the condition			2
