a professor at the @entity1 has sparked outrage by claiming black students are failing academically because they have been raised in single parent homes usually by females			1
law professor @entity6 was talking to the @entity7 when he said he could ' hardly imagine a less beneficial or more deleterious experience than to be raised by a single parent , usually female , uneducated and without a lot of money			1
' he said the average black performance on sat test is 200 points lower than that for the average white student and that among the black population almost three quarters of children are now born outside of marriage			1
race row : professor @entity6 suggested that being raised in single parent families is affecting the academic performance of @entity24 and @entity25 students the outspoken professor appeared slightly flustered when the @entity7 interviewer pointed out that he was black and raised in a single parent family himself			1
but he continued : ' how well do these kids do in maths and reading is basically it and they do less well			0
' and race or segregation or history would n't matter one bit if that was not the case			0
' no doubt the race and segregation may have a lot to do why that 's the case , but it is the case and what to do about it now ? ' and admitting them into selective schools with large gaps in qualification is not the answer			0
' @entity6 is no stranger to controversy and was accused of racism in 1997 after telling a conservative student group that black and @entity51 - @entity50 cultures ' set children up for failure '			1
he said : ' they have a culture that seems not to encourage achievement			2
' failure is not looked upon with disgrace			2
' in response the @entity60 demanded he resign issuing a resolution which stated : ' @entity6 believes that minority students come from a culture of failure			1
' he knows nothing of our culture and has never crawled down from his ivory tower to find out			2
@entity6 , who lectures at the @entity1 was accused of racism in 1997 after telling a conservative student group that black and @entity51 - @entity50 cultures ' set children up for failure ' ' his lack of respect for the students who sit in his classes is unacceptable			1
his contempt for our leaders is intolerable			0
' the @entity1 is currently fighting a legal battle in the @entity84 with a white student who claims she was forced to go to a second - rate college as a result of the @entity89 's affirmative action program			0
despite graduating in the top 11 per cent of her class in 2008 , @entity90 was rejected from @entity1 and ' forced to attend ' @entity92 instead			0
she has now taken her claim to the @entity94 claiming that she was denied entrance into @entity1 because she is white , and was n't afforded the same career opportunities she 'd have had otherwise			0
she told the @entity97 : ' i probably would have gotten a better job offer had i gone to @entity1 '			0
