@entity6 at the @entity5 launch in @entity20 earlier this week @entity6 , 29 , said : ' he clocked it immediately - i 'm very similar to @entity2 in the sense that it really does n't take much to wind me up			1
' he loves to joke around			2
' that 's the reason he goes for her too - it does n't take much to get a reaction			0
' my funniest point so far has been when he was pressing my buttons by telling me that even his two dogs @entity32 and @entity34 were more popular than me with the general public			0
' he did a test by putting a shout out to me on @entity38 to all of his followers			0
' then he immediately put a photo of his two dogs on there and said we 'd judge how popular we both were by how many responses they got			0
' after a couple of hours when i next bumped into him , he was like , ' so my dogs got this many thousands of favourites and re-tweets , and you got just this many , hmmmmm			0
' ' it 's all good fun though , he has got a great sense of humour and he does n't mind you joking around back			0
' i also get teased over my boyfriend because i 'm punching above my weight , the rest of the crew enjoy that one			0
running the show : @entity12 at the launch of his latest @entity5 show at @entity20 's @entity64 hotel on wednesday ' @entity66 ( @entity67 ) has come down onto set a few times and they love him on there , they like to try and wind me up by saying that he 's way too good looking for me			1
' it 's just like a big family there , everyone teases each other and just messes around , but at the same time they are incredibly professional , it 's amazing how hard everyone works			0
' @entity6 has a busy few days ahead of her - as well as preparing for the first @entity5 show this weekend , she has to record her @entity79 show			2

and despite having barely enough time to breathe right now , @entity6 signed up to front the event because the cause is close to her heart after being on the end of a breast cancer scare earlier this year when she found a lump in her breast			1
fortunately , it turned out to be benign and after an operation to remove it , she is in good health			0
@entity6 with her long - term boyfriend @entity110 at the @entity111 in july but it gave her a scare and made her realise the importance of regular breast checks			1
she said : ' i would never have even noticed it if i had n't been asked to pose up checking my boobs for the @entity82 campaign 's check em tuesday - i did that and then i found the lump			2
' after tests and an operation , i am now fine and very lucky that it was n't something more serious , but i want to show girls how important this issue is			0
@entity6 taking part in the @entity130 in aid of @entity82 ! in @entity20 's @entity92 today ' the week i found that lump was one of the most emotionally strained ever because in the same three days i found it , i also went to go and see @entity12 to have my first chat about this @entity5 job			1
' my mum and i were just talking last night about how crazy it is that all happened only a few months ago , now that everything has worked out ok			0
' but it just goes to show how important it is to check for lumps - i would never have done it otherwise and if it had been more serious , it could have been much worse for me right now			0
