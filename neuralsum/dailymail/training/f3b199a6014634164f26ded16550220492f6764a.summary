by @entity0 published : 04:02 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 04:34 est , 21 august 2012 exposure to a common parasite hosted by cats could make people more likely to attempt suicide , according to new research			1
@entity7 - which can cause toxoplasmosis - is easily transmitted to humans and has already been linked to a series of personality and behavioural changes			1
a recent study found that people who tested positive for exposure to toxoplasmosis were seven times more likely to have a history of suicide attempts			1
hidden threat ? scientists have linked toxoplasmosis gondii , the parasite hosted by cats and easily transmitted to humans , to a series of behavioural changes around a third of people carry toxoplasma gondii , with most catching it by consuming undercooked meat or anything contaminated with cat faeces			1
exposure to the parasite can lead to toxoplasmosis , which scientists have already linked to behavioural changes and even the development of schizophrenia			0
a report in the @entity41 said people infected become more ' expedient , suspicious , jealous and dogmatic '			0
a study carried out in a @entity45 hospital indicated that testing positive for exposure to toxoplasmosis correlated strongly with suicide attempts			1
a group of 54 patients of both sexes - all with a history of attempting suicide - were assessed for the study , along with 30 control subjects			2
scientists used blood tests to determine their history of exposure to toxoplasmosis			0
the study concluded that both men and women who tested positive for immune responses to the infection were seven times more likely to have a history of ' non-fatal suicidal self - directed violence '			1
toxoplasma gondii : around a third of people carry the parasite , with most catching it through consuming undercooked meat , or anything contaminated with cat faeces the report in the @entity41 said that identifying toxoplasmosis as a risk factor for suicide could be of benefit in suicide prevention			2
however it said the evidence of correlation between exposure to the infection and suicide attempts did not mean the relationship was causal , adding : ' ... by no means do you need to live with cats in order to contract toxo			2
' it increases your risk of exposure , but there are ways that even high - risk immune - compromised people can live safely with cats			0
' earlier this year @entity101 scientist @entity100 claimed to be a living example of toxoplasma gondii causing schizophrenia			0
the 63 - year - old said he had contracted the parasite , and that it had led him to behave in strange , self - destructive ways			0
signs of toxoplasmosis can include mild flu - like symptoms such as a high temperature , sore throat or aching muscles - although the common infection often causes no symptoms at all			1
it can cause serious complications in people with weakened immune systems			0
the full study is due to be published in a forthcoming issue of the @entity122 .			0

@entity7 is easily transmitted to humans and can cause the common infection toxoplasmosis
study shows people who have had the infection seven times more likely to attempt suicide
