by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 is hoping to attract the attention of clubs such as @entity4 again once he sorts out his form at @entity7 club @entity6			1
the 20 - year - old playmaker was continually linked with a big money move to the @entity10 in january but the switch fell through after @entity4 refused to meet his hefty £ 37million buy - out clause			1
and the speculation looked to have affected @entity1 's form as he went on to score just twice in the @entity15 last season - leading to little interest being declared this summer			2
' i did not play like 20 clubs were ready to pay this sum for me last season			2
i have to become attractive to big clubs again			0
' and the @entity21 midfielder is now hoping to match his achievements that first attracted @entity4 's interest with 10 goals during the 2012 - 13 campaign			1
' this season , 10 goals should be possible for me			0
if our squad stays together , we can compete for the top three places			0
we can compete with @entity43 and @entity44			0
' quality : @entity4 were potential suitors but after a poor season £ 37million would be too high a price big money : @entity49 has already added @entity50 to his squad this summer			1

@entity6 midfielder *admits* he has *n't* played well enough to attract attention
@entity4 *wanted* to make a move for playmaker in january
but his £ 37m *release* clause put the @entity10 off the *transfer*
@entity1 had a poor season , scoring just twice at club level
he now wants to hit double figures to attract @entity4 's attention again
