by @entity0 @entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football ... with relief in @entity6 and a look through the leagues , too			1
this week includes @entity10 's contract situation , @entity12 's important ( if short ) role at @entity13 and @entity15 's first call at @entity16 may be his best			1
1 ) @entity10 ’s short - term contract at @entity18 runs out this month and @entity18 are talking to him about a new deal			1
but if the 30 - year - old chooses not to play second fiddle to @entity23 now the £ 17million man is close to being fit he ’s done a good job of putting himself in the shop window for other clubs			1
his goal at @entity28 meant he has scored on both of his @entity29 starts – and his four goals in all have come at a rate of one every 99 minutes			2
come and get me : @entity10 may find himself out of favour at @entity18 when @entity23 fully returns @entity12 gets the job done 2 ) @entity12 has become the go - to man for @entity13 when you need to hang on to a lead			1
@entity37 turned to him for the final 11 minutes at @entity38 , and he kept the ball superbly with 11 of 12 passes finding a team - mate – including the one that set up @entity45 ’s goal that clinched the 2 - 0 win			2
his pass completion rate has been better than 90 per cent in eight of the 13 times he ’s come off the bench this season			2
solid : @entity12 has been @entity13 's mr @entity52 this season in all competitions 3 ) in the days of extravagant squad numbers , @entity55 might be heading to the @entity29 with a delightfully traditional look about them			1
@entity60 ’s side which won 2 - 1 at @entity61 were the only one of the 90 clubs to play so far this weekend fielding a goalkeeper and back four wearing shirts from one to five			2
for good measure prolific front pair @entity66 and @entity68 are nine and 10 , and for a few minutes after substitute @entity70 replaced @entity71 , only two of their outfield players were wearing numbers higher than 11			0
number game : @entity55 might be heading to the @entity29 with a delightfully traditional look about them @entity78 is making @entity16 tick 4 ) one of the first things @entity15 did when he was promoted to take charge of @entity16 was push teenager @entity78 into the first team			0
the @entity83 - born 19 - year - old , who has spent three years at @entity16 ’s academy after being let go by @entity86 , has grabbed the chance			1
he made @entity16 tick against @entity89 , and his 99 accurate passes from 106 attempts has only been bettered by six midfield men in the @entity29 all season			0
@entity94 : @entity78 was a handful against @entity89 on saturday and is getting attention in the top flight 5 ) if the @entity29 is supposed to be no place for old men , then @entity98 must be in even more danger of relegation than their 4 - 1 thumping at home by @entity105 would suggest			1
of @entity108 ’s starting line - up at @entity109 , only @entity106 was under 28 – and the average age was 30 years and two months			1
experienced or ageing ? only one player in @entity108 's starting xi was under 28 - @entity106 @entity113 helps @entity114 ? 6 ) @entity114 is constantly worried about how few of his potential @entity116 stars get regular @entity29 football			1
so @entity113 ’s decision to move @entity119 into @entity121 ’s midfield in the 2 - 0 win at @entity123 looks like good news for the @entity126 manager			1
it means his first choice centre half @entity129 , on the bench for a third of his club ’s games this season when the @entity137 has partnered @entity138 , now looks to have made his own the place alongside the former @entity126 skipper			1
cemented : @entity129 seemingly now has his own place in the @entity121 defence , which can only be good for @entity126 7 ) not the least of @entity144 ’s achievements since taking temporary control of @entity146 has been to help one - time @entity126 starlet @entity147 to rediscover his form			1
the 20 - year - old , whose career has stalled since his £ 8million move to @entity105 in june 2011 , got his eighth goal in ten games on loan at @entity155 to contribute to the 6 - 0 annihilation of hapless @entity157			0
six of them have been since @entity144 took charge , but he will have to make the most of it			0
@entity147 ’s extended loan deal must end on january 29			0
loanee : eight goals in ten games has made every sit up and take notice of @entity147 again @entity166 will test @entity167 8 ) @entity168 ’s young manager @entity167 is getting some good lessons on managing a maverick talent , thanks to the club ’s decision to give a chance to former @entity38 striker @entity166			2
the robins were ready to kick him out after the troubled 22 - year - old went awol from training			0
@entity167 got his players to vote on whether they would accept an apology - and the ‘ yes ’ decision was rewarded when he scored the first in a 2 - 1 win over promotion rivals @entity184			0
@entity167 said : ‘ the players decided we were a better team with him than without			0
’ tricky one : @entity166 has a troubled past , and is sure to test @entity167 's management skills 9 ) @entity190 , two points off the play - off places in @entity193 , have been punching above their weight and that ’s mainly because of a never - say - die spirit			2
@entity198 ’s team rescued a point against @entity200 with a late goal by @entity202 – meaning they have now rescued 21 of their 37 points this season from games in which they were losing			0
10 ) the last thing either second placed @entity208 or leaders @entity210 need in the race to earn automatic promotion from the @entity213 is extra games			0
neither manager would have been too happy , then , when second half goals from @entity217 and @entity218 forced a replay in the @entity221 clash between the clubs after @entity210 had led 2 - 0			0
the game drew a crowd of 3,194 incidentally – bigger than four of the 12 gates in @entity193			0
build up : @entity210 will have to play an extra game having drawn 2 - 2 with @entity208 in the @entity221			0

@entity18 striker @entity10 is putting himself in the shop window
@entity98 's average age on saturday was 30 years and two months
@entity129 has now cemented his position in central defence at @entity121
