@entity0 could force his way out of @entity2 this summer , costing the club up to £ 25million while saving potential suitors such as @entity5 and @entity6 the same amount			1
under @entity10 regulations the 20 - year - old is entitled to ' buy - out ' the last year of his current contract which runs out in 2017			1
the effect of that would see the fee @entity2 could command for the forward dramatically reduce			2
@entity0 has rejected a new £ 100,000 - a - week contract with @entity2 and could leave this summer the 20 year - old could lower his value by buying - out the last year of his current deal for £ 1.7million @entity2 insist they will hold firm and not be forced into selling @entity0 in the close season			1
however , the @entity23 would have to reconsider their stance if @entity0 and his advisers go down the route of buying out a chunk of his contract			0
it is understood @entity2 value @entity0 as high as £ 50million given his age , talent and potential			2
however , if @entity0 effectively only had one year left on his contract that fee would be reduced considerably - perhaps even in half to £ 25 million			2
with @entity0 currently on a £ 35,000 a week , it would cost the @entity37 international £ 1.7m to buy out the last year of his contract			2
that sum could swiftly be recouped in the form of a signing on fee with a new club and , of course , in wages			0
@entity5 and @entity6 are both keen on @entity0 , pictured racing against @entity46 @entity0 's value could plummet by up to £ 25million is he chooses to buy - out the final year of his contract @entity2 have remained steadfast that their current offer of £ 100,000 - a - week , with potential increments , is more than fair			1
but the player and his advisers believe he is now worthy of earning in the region of £ 150,000 - a - week			0
that is the sum the @entity0 camp believe they can get elsewhere with clubs they feel are more likely to play @entity58 football			0
thus far , the stalemate between @entity0 and @entity2 does not seem to have affected his performances too much			2
however , there are those close to the club who feel the situation can not continue to rumble on for too long for fear of upsetting the mood of the camp			0
the situation also has the potential to affect @entity2 's moves in the transfer market this summer			2
@entity73 remains the name that keeps bouncing back from @entity76 sources as the most likely to replace @entity77 this summer			1
@entity73 , a @entity76 hero as a player , has an impressive managerial cv having coached @entity80 and also has @entity58 experience with current club @entity82			2
@entity82 manager @entity73 is in the frame to replace @entity77 at @entity76 this summer however , @entity73 has not managed in the @entity10 and the @entity76 hierarchy are nervous about who comes in to take over from @entity77 given how crucial staying in the top - flight is next season with the club moving into the @entity89 in 2017			1
while @entity92 's @entity91 last week dismissed stories linking him to a move to @entity95 , the 36 - year - old has been added to @entity76 's ' long list ' along with @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
@entity101 are set to make a move for @entity104 striker @entity103 when the transfer window opens			1
the @entity101 believe they could pip @entity76 in a move for the @entity108 forward , currently on loan at @entity110 , by offering @entity111 to @entity104 for a reduced fee of £ 20m			1
@entity101 could offer @entity111 ( right ) to @entity104 in order to sign @entity103 ( left ) @entity115 's decision to quit @entity116 caused immediate reports that he could take over at @entity5 or @entity118 this summer			1
the speculation in each case was not without foundation			0
although @entity5 retain the stance they will remain loyal to @entity125 , there is bound to be a review of the @entity128 's position at the end of what has become a disappointing season			0
while it would seem @entity118 's revival will see @entity136 remain in the @entity138 ' hotseat for another season , the sudden and rare availability of a coach with a cv and reputation such as @entity115 's could focus minds at the north @entity142 club and raise questions about long term planning and an improvement of the clubs @entity10 and @entity58 challenges			0
meanwhile , @entity149 club @entity148 remain interested in @entity151 's unsettled striker @entity150			0
@entity115 could move to the @entity10 after announcing that he will leave @entity116 @entity152 could make a move for @entity154 forward @entity155 this summer			1
despite the rise of @entity158 , @entity156 still want to bolster their strike force			0
however , @entity76 , with big ambitions in the build up to their move to @entity89 , may take on rivals @entity156 in a £ 20m - plus battle for the @entity165 international with the @entity76 in the market for a new marksman			1
@entity154 's in - form striker @entity155 is a summer transfer target for @entity156 and @entity76 i am hearing @entity172 boss @entity171 has attracted the attention of several clubs given that he has yet to be offered a long term deal by the @entity176			1
despite taking @entity172 to the brink of the @entity10 , the 46 - year - old @entity177 - who has revived the club since taking over in october - still has no idea whether he will be given a long - term deal			1
that will surely be the case should @entity172 gain promotion			0
however , if they miss out , @entity171 could be on the market			0
there would be plenty of @entity191 clubs interested and some possible suitors in the @entity10 such as @entity193			0
@entity172 boss @entity171 is still not sure whether he will be in charge of the @entity176 long - term i am also hearing @entity76 insist they will not be listening to offers for left back @entity198			2
the defender has attracted the attention of several top clubs including @entity6			0
however , an offer of £ 20m could turn their head			0
the @entity76 would then return to @entity205 , having signed @entity198 from the @entity205 for £ 5m last summer , and offer a similar sum for 22 - year - old @entity207			1
@entity207 , who replaced @entity198 at left back , is also on @entity118 's radar			0
@entity76 want to keep hold of defender @entity198 , who is a target for @entity10 leaders @entity6 the @entity76 could make a move for @entity205 's @entity207 if they do cash in on @entity213 this summer			1

@entity0 's contract with @entity2 expires in the summer of 2017
the forward could buy - out the final year of his deal for £ 1.7million
@entity2 may be forced to accept a much lower bid for the 20 - year - old
@entity73 is in the frame to replace @entity77 at @entity76
@entity101 set to make summer bid for @entity104 's @entity103
@entity156 still interested in move for @entity154 's @entity155
@entity76 determined to keep hold of @entity6 target @entity198
