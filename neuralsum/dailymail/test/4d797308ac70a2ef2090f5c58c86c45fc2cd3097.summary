@entity1 chief sir @entity0 launched a bid to keep @entity4 ' receipts private all @entity4 ' expenses receipts will have to be published after a court threw out a bid to keep them private			1
the commons expenses watchdog , the @entity1 , had launched a bid to keep @entity4 ' original claims secret			1
but the @entity11 ruled today that it must release all the copies of receipts and invoices which have been submitted by politicians			1
the legal action centred on whether copies of original documents should be published - rather than a summary of the claim put in by @entity4			1
the case stems from a @entity23 request to @entity1 in 2010 - just a year after the @entity4 ' expenses scandal erupted - asking for three specific receipts submitted by politicians in support of their claims			1
but instead of providing the original receipts , @entity1 sent back a typed - up summary of the claims			1
the information commissioner later ruled that the receipts themselves should have been published - but @entity1 continued to fight the case			2
today 's ruling comes six years after the mps expenses scandal broke - triggering the most explosive @entity39 political scandal in a generation			2
voters reacted with fury at the list of extraordinary claims submitted by @entity4 - with jaw - dropping details of fraud , fake receipts and payouts for ornamental duck houses and moat cleaning			1
yet , today 's latest court ruling shows the the scandal has refused to die , six years and almost two general elections later			0
after dismissing the privacy appeal today , @entity54 said the receipts could still not be published in full - to give @entity1 time to appeal again to the @entity57			2
an @entity1 spokesman said after the ruling : ' we need to study the judgement carefully			0
the court made clear that this is an important test case with implications not just for @entity1 but for all other public bodies			0
' we were right to test the point of law through an appeal to see whether images of receipts add anything additional to all the information about @entity4 ' expenditure that we already release			1
' the spokesman added : ' we remain completely committed to openness and transparency and already publish a detailed breakdown of every claim made by every mp			0
' @entity54 said that although the appeal was concerned with three specific invoices or receipts ' it is a test case and has important implications for @entity1 and , no doubt , for other public authorities '			2
he said @entity1 publishes details of claims on its website but does not publish copies of the supporting invoices or receipts			1
in 2010 @entity94 , then a @entity96 reporter , made a request to @entity1 for the information contained in three such documents to be sent to him			0
@entity102 's expenses watchdog has fought plans to keep @entity4 ' original receipts secret - arguing that it should only have to publish a summary of their claims the @entity4 expenses revealed a series of extravagant claims - including for the repair of a ' @entity113 ' duck house by @entity115 mp sir @entity114 the judge said @entity1 responded ' with a transcript of information contained in the documents , including information additional to that published on its website , but refused to provide copies of the documents themselves '			1
@entity1 was set up to restore public confidence following the 2009 expenses scandal , which led to some mps being jailed			2
in that same year , parliamentary authorities published more than a million receipts online - with details such as addresses and account numbers hidden			0
however , @entity1 decided in 2010 not to publish receipts routinely , restricting its regular releases to a summary of each claim			0
it said there were a number of factors which had led it to decide that there was '' insufficient public benefit '' in publishing receipts and invoices			0
in a letter to the information commissioner , it said : ' primarily , a trial of extracting and redacting receipts and invoices for the purposes of publication showed that the cost would be in excess of £ 1 million for additional staffing and it costs alone , compared to the approximate £ 250,000 cost under the chosen model			0
' it said ' on balance ' it took the view that providing images of receipts or invoices would be ' disproportionate in terms of costs , insufficiently beneficial in terms of transparency and represented a higher risk in terms of data protection ' .			0

commons expenses watchdog launched bid to keep @entity4 ' claims private
@entity11 ruled it must release all the copies of receipts submitted
it means voters will be able to check over @entity4 ' original expenses claims
