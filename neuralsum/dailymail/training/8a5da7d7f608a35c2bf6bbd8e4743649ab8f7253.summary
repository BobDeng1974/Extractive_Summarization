@entity0 has fuelled doubt over @entity3 ’s future after providing a bizarre response to questions regarding the goalkeeper ’s omission on sunday			1
@entity8 understands the @entity10 goalkeeper arrived at the @entity11 expecting to start in the 3 - 0 win over @entity13 , despite being reprimanded for smoking in the showers following the @entity17 defeat at @entity18			1
however , the goalkeeper found that he had been dropped and replaced with @entity19 , a decision that is said to have stunned and bewildered the 24 - year - old			1
after a long pause , @entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t know , but how can you take a decision ? you know how you can take a decision			2
’ and then , when asked about why he dropped @entity3 , @entity0 added : ‘ look , i do n’t want to talk too much about that because the more i talk , the less i inform you			1
was the smoking incident the reason ? no. honestly , no. ’ nevertheless , @entity3 ’s future at the club seems more uncertain than ever			2
@entity8 revealed two weeks ago that @entity0 had instructed his scouts to identify a new no 1 ahead of the summer transfer window due to @entity3 ’s indifferent performances			1
and the keeper ’s smoking antics at @entity50 ’s merely reinforced @entity0 ’s view that he needs a new shot - stopper in place for next season			2
following his clean sheet in the @entity55 win over @entity56 last week , @entity19 was handed his first @entity57 start on sunday			2
and after a second consecutive clean sheet , @entity3 will find it difficult to regain his place against @entity61 next weekend			0
‘ will @entity19 keep his place ? i do n’t know , i have n’t made a decision yet , ’ insisted @entity0			1
‘ i made a decision for today ’s game			0
@entity3 is our no 1 , he is competing with @entity68 and ( @entity69 ) @entity70 and that ’s our job , we have to accept that			0
’ meanwhile , @entity73 is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after dislocating a shoulder following a collision with @entity78			0
the @entity79 international , who has only recently returned from a long - term lay - off due to an ankle injury , needed lengthy treatment after being pushed towards the advertising hoardings by the @entity13 forward in the 12th minute			0
@entity73 had an x-ray but will see a specialist today to establish how long he will be unavailable , though he will definitely miss the clash against @entity90 ’s men			0
with @entity92 still suffering with an ankle problem and @entity94 missing sunday 's clash through illness , @entity73 ’s injury has highlighted @entity26 ’s need to sign another defender this month			0
@entity0 said : ‘ it does n’t change my plans for the market because i was in the market anyway			0
’ @entity103 will replace @entity3 between the sticks as @entity26 take on @entity13 at the @entity11			1

@entity3 was found smoking after @entity26 's @entity18 loss
@entity19 replaces him in goal for @entity57 game with @entity13
@entity0 *adamant* the decision is down to form , not discipline
