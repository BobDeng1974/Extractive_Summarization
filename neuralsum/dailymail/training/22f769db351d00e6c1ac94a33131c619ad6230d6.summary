by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 9 september 2013 police are to be investigated over claims that a man who died after being shot with a @entity4 was mistaken for a wanted criminal with the same name			1
@entity7 , 23 , who had a suspected heart defect , was hit with a charge from the 50,000 - volt stun gun after officers were called to deal with a row at his home last month			1
yesterday it emerged that the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) is looking into claims of a tragic mix - up			0
@entity7 , pictured at his workplace , was tasered by greater @entity20 officers and later died in hospital namesake : @entity7 , who was wanted by the police at the time the watchdog said mistaken identity was one line of inquiry , but said mr @entity7 ’s family had not made the claim to investigators			1
‘ we will look at all relevant information , including call handling and radio transmissions between officers responding to mr @entity7 ’s address to see if any mistake occurred , and if it did , if that mistake had any inappropriate influence on any officer ’s decisions to use force , ’ said an @entity15 spokesman			1
police also insist there is no evidence to support the claim and say they were initially told that mr @entity7 had a knife			1
officers were called to the ice cream factory worker ’s home in @entity54 , @entity55 , by his mother dot on july 10 to deal with a row between him and a neighbour			1
loss : a picture of a five - year - old mr @entity7 with his younger brother @entity62 , now 17 mr @entity7 's mother @entity63 says @entity62 ( left ) is inconsolable about his brother 's death			1
the picture on the right shows @entity7 as a two - year - old minutes after officers from @entity20 arrived , mr @entity7 was shot using a taser and died less than two hours later			1
grief and anger : @entity63 wants answers about the day her son died mrs @entity63 , a 46 - year - old café worker , said yesterday that officers had repeatedly asked if she was from sale – the nearby home town of a 25 - year - old wanted burglar who had the same name as her son and who had breached the terms of his prison licence			2
‘ it did n’t make sense at the time but then when i found out about the other @entity7 it clicked , ’ she said			1
she claimed her son was unarmed and ‘ calm and compliant ’ before he was shot , which left him ‘ battered and bruised ’ and with ‘ his eyes flickering ’			0
‘ the response was so heavy - handed – @entity7 was nine stone and they ’d been called out to deal with a domestic argument , ’ she added			2
‘ he was calm and compliant , he was n’t armed and they could have cuffed him if they wanted to			0
i ca n’t believe they ’ve followed protocol and there ’s no way that @entity4 should ever have been used			0
’ mr @entity7 is the tenth person to die after being shot with a taser since they were introduced in 2004			2
six weeks before the incident he had collapsed from an irregular heartbeat and was undergoing tests to diagnose a suspected heart condition when he died			2
a @entity107 post-mortem examination has so far failed to establish mr @entity7 ’s cause of death , but independent tests carried out on behalf of the family found he had marks that suggest he had been handcuffed			2
the family have also launched a civil claim against police over his death			2
assistant chief constable @entity116 confirmed the mistaken identity claims but said she was ‘ not aware ’ of any evidence to support it			0
‘ we will of course continue to work with the @entity15 to assist their investigation , ’ she added			0
the other @entity7 was eventually rearrested by police a week after the @entity4 incident and returned to prison			1
@entity125 in @entity55 , where the incident took place mrs @entity63 was stunned when armed officers arrived at her house and stormed inside the small terraced @entity129 says she was forced to wait outside her home as around 10 officers spoke to her son inside			1
for the first time she has spoken publicly about the night she says left her life ‘ in ruins ’			0
she said : ' not long after he got back from work there was an argument with a neighbour but it was something or nothing			0
@entity7 had been threatened and he wanted to go back outside and sort it out but i locked the door and phoned the police			1
' two officers arrived at first and everything was very calm , they were on the doorstep chatting but then loads of vans turned up with armed officers and they forced him inside			0
he was calm and compliant and doing everything they told him and for that reason i thought everything was going to be okay			0
' i was outside looking in through the front door and i could see they had a @entity4 pointed at him , he had his arms by his side and was still following instructions			0
' one of the officers kept saying " step back , step back " but he was against the dining room table and could n’t step back any further			0
at that point one of the officers closed the front door on me			0
' the first time mrs @entity63 realised @entity7 had been tasered was when an ambulance arrived at the house and he was carried out on a stretcher			1
she described her son as ‘ battered and bruised ’ and with ‘ his eyes flickering ’ .			0
