the prominent recruitment drive , which has been plastered across billboards and posters around the country , uses the phrase ' be cool and join the navy ' to entice would - be sailors into joining the @entity12 , the official name for the @entity0 navy			1
the defence minister behind the campaign said the language would appeal to the younger generation , who have grown up communicating over the internet			1
but a wave of right - wing mps and commentators have blasted the campaign , claiming it has ' wounded patriotism ' and sparked ' anger and disgust '			2
controversial : @entity0 have reacted angrily after the country 's @entity12 - the navy - launched a recruitment campaign using the slogan ' be cool and join the navy ' in @entity2 they are incensed not only by the use of @entity2 on the posters , but also by the use of the word ' navy ' as opposed to the official @entity12			1
others are outraged by the phrase ' be cool ' , with one chiding : ' are we an @entity43 colony now ? ' @entity44 , an mp with the right - wing @entity45 , told parliament the slogan was ' unacceptable ' and that defence minister @entity48 should be suspended for ' wounding patriotism '			1
