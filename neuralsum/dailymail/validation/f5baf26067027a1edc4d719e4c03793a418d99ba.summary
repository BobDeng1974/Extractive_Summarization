@entity4 , attempting to quiet concerns about the security of her private email system , said tuesday she never discussed classified information over email			1
and if hackers tried to obtain copies of her communications , they could n't have , @entity12 said , because she had ' numerous safeguards ' in place to protect her home - brewed server			1
' it was on property guarded by the @entity18 , and there were no security breaches , ' @entity12 said at a press conference			1
security experts remain doubtful , however , that @entity12 's emails contained only unclassified information and warn that her email or server could have been hacked without her knowledge - possibly exposing sensitive communications between the former secretary of state and the president			1
' it would be pretty easy for a nation - state to compromise that account , and pretty easy to hide the fact that they had compromised that account , ' he said			0
the @entity54 acknowledged on monday that @entity12 and @entity55 did email each other from time to time			1
' i would not describe the number of emails as large , but they did have the occasion to email each other , ' @entity54 spokesman @entity57 told reporters			0
the @entity66 technician who was in charge of the team that built president @entity55 ’s specialized @entity69 , @entity70 , said it 's unlikely the president ever said anything to @entity12 over email that could be seen as damaging if exposed			1
' he ’s actually very security conscious … there ’s no , absolutely no , chance that he put anything sensitive in those emails , ' @entity70 told @entity46			0
still , @entity80 , a former chief information security officer at the @entity81 who is now oversee secuirty at @entity83 , cautioned that even the most innocent of conversations between @entity12 and @entity55 could be dangerous if they fell into the wrong hands			2
' there ’s more intelligence in casual conversation than you might think , just because he ’s the president of the damned @entity91 , ' @entity42 told the publication			0
a q and a document sent to reporters by @entity12 's staff after the former @entity36 official 's tuesday afternoon briefing with the press asserted that ' robust protections were put in place ' by the secretary and updated as needed			1
yet it did not say what those were , citing concerns that ' people with ill - intentions ' would attempt to break into her security system , which @entity12 says was set up her husband , @entity111 , a former president , and guards the private communications of both him and his aides			2
the nine - page document disclosed , however , that third - party experts were consulted			0
it did not name names			0
@entity118 , principal technologist at the @entity119 told @entity46 that unless @entity12 ' was paying a team of people to keep her personal email secure , it ’s likely it was less secure , ' however			0
the @entity36 , he pointed out , has a full - time security team and the @entity66 at its disposal			0
' it was on property guarded by the @entity18 , and there were no security breaches , ' @entity12 said at a press conference @entity134 @entity133 @entity132 , head of the task force that ' s investigating the 2012 @entity137 terrorist attack to determine what knowledge the @entity36 possessed - if any - that could have prevented the assault , said tuesday afternoon that @entity12 should be required to turn over the server for inspection			1
she also needs to answer lingering , ' serious questions ' about the security of the system she employed , ' he said in a statement , and ' who had access to the server from the time secretary @entity12 left office until the time – almost two years later – the @entity36 asked for these public records back			1
' @entity132 also wants access to the server to determine if any of the more than 30,000 personal emails @entity12 says she got rid of because they were not related to her work at the @entity36 can be retrieved			2
@entity12 says gave the @entity36 copies of all her work - related emails , yet ' without access to secretary @entity12 's personal server , there is no way for the @entity36 to know it has acquired all documents that should be made public , ' @entity132 said			1
the former @entity55 administration official said tuesday the server will remain out of the government 's grasp , however			2
' no one wants their personal email made public , and i think most people understand that and respect that privacy , ' she told reporters while explaining her decision to toss emails she did n't think were pertinent to national security			0
should @entity12 change her mind and give the government unfettered access to her private property @entity186 , senior security adviser at @entity188 computer company @entity187 , says its possible that anything she tried to destroy may still be on the server			2
' if the emails were on a server in her house and she deleted them , there ’s a chance the emails could still be on the server ’s hard drive if you forensically examine it , ' he told the @entity204			0
' to make sure the emails are really destroyed , you would have to physically destroy the hard drive , which many companies and places like the @entity210 often do			0
' reporters flooded the @entity213 's headquarters on tuesday to listen to former secretary of state @entity4 answer questions about her use of a private email system while serving in president @entity55 's cabinet			1
a q and a document sent to reporters after the briefing asserted that ' robust protections were put in place ' by @entity12 and updated as needed another concern of government officials is that @entity12 deliberated classified information via her personal email address , which is against the law			1
she says she did n't			0
' classified information was viewed in hard copy by the secretary while in the office , ' the statement from her office distributed on tuesday said			1
but a former senior @entity36 official who worked in the diplomatic core of the government before her told the @entity204 that @entity12 's claim is dubious			2
' i would assume that more than 50 percent of what the secretary of state dealt with was classified , ' he said			0
' was every single email of the secretary of state completely unclassified ? maybe , but it ’s hard to imagine			2
' even if @entity12 did confer with her colleagues about classified topics over email , ' there ’s zero chance that she ’ll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information , because she decides what ’s classified , ' @entity247 , director of the @entity248 at the @entity249 , told the @entity204			1
the secretary of state , he said , has the highest classification authority at the department and the power to dictate what is and is n't restricted .			0

' it was on property guarded by the @entity18 , and there were no security breaches , ' @entity12 said at a press conference on tuesday
a document passed out by @entity12 's staff says ' robust protections were put in place ' by the secretary and updated as needed
email or server could have been hacked without her knowledge , though - possibly exposing communications between she and the president
@entity54 acknowledged on monday that @entity12 and @entity55 did email each other from time to time
@entity12 's office says she viewed classified information via hard copy ; a former state official from before @entity12 's time says that 's ' hard to imagine '
@entity133 want to inspect @entity12 's server to determine if any of the emails she deleted can be retrieved
