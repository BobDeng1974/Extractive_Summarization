click here for your brilliant @entity1 inlcuding @entity4 's heat map the nation that departed the last @entity6 amid calamity is quietly making its case as one of the prime contenders at this one			1
@entity11 , who left @entity13 in chaos , shame and recriminations after the squad mutinied against the manager , progressed to the quarter - finals yesterday against a spirited @entity21 team			1
and while never sparkling , they were unfussily efficient , benefiting greatly from the 62nd - minute replacement of @entity24 with @entity25 , which changed the attacking dynamic of the match			2
and @entity4 , who has been under a degree of pressure , with some urging @entity30 to drop him , demonstrated some of the reasons why @entity33 will demand £ 60million for him should he be sold			1
he has n’t yet managed to be the midfield fulcrum for which the team yearn , but his headed goal after 79 minutes yesterday might yet make him the toast of @entity11			1

‘ @entity4 is young and i think it ’s normal that he ’s been criticised , ’ said the manager			1
‘ it ’s part of a high - level footballer ’s life			2
sometimes it ’s painful , sometimes it ’s unfair but it will toughen him up			0
and he stood up today and showed his potential			0
' maybe he played more simply than usually and all credit to him			0
i did n’t doubt his ability			0
’ @entity21 , who had initially looked the more vibrant and incisive of the teams , could count themselves a little unlucky , not least their impressive goalkeeper , @entity56			1
he has been one of the outstanding players and characters of this tournament and his excellent form continued here at the @entity138 up until the 79th minute , when his handling error allowed @entity4 to open the scoring			1
‘ i do n’t know why he padded the ball from the corner , ’ said his coach @entity106			2
‘ his decision is final and what happened , happened			0
’ even @entity11 ’s second — a @entity149 own goal from close range , under pressure from @entity25 on 90 minutes — could have been dealt with better by @entity56			1
skills : @entity4 turns on the ball during @entity11 's last 16 tie against @entity21 at the @entity155 in @entity112 fall to the floor : @entity67 is left grounded as @entity93 marauds forward with ball back of the net : @entity11 defender @entity63 is assisted by @entity62 after hurting his head midfield battle : @entity11 midfielder @entity67 challenges @entity21 's @entity93 on monday evening turn of pace : @entity11 forward @entity70 spins past @entity21 's @entity163 centre back @entity85 @entity30 is unbeaten in 10 games hehas taken part in at the @entity6 as playerand manager ( @entity168 )			1
still , though @entity11 weathered difficult periods , they were in control from the moment @entity24 was withdrawn and @entity25 restored their attacking balance , with @entity70 moving into the centre			1
in fact it proved an inglorious afternoon for the @entity177 striker , who was fortunate that the referee appeared not to see his elbow aimed at @entity90			0
there was no mistaking who the locals wanted to win , with the stadium echoing to chants of ‘ @entity21 ! @entity21 ! ’ and the small knots of @entity188 fans who tried to make their voice heard invariably provoking whistles			1
the @entity191 had insisted before the game that the dispute over £ 2.25million in bonus payments had been quickly forgotten and so it seemed as they started at a pace and with a degree of incision which suggested they expected to win			0
video @entity106 steps down in wake of defeat caught in the middle : @entity67 attempts to move forward but is surrounded by three @entity191 players strength : @entity11 striker @entity24 holds off the challenge of @entity21 midfielder @entity88 lost cause : @entity62 fails in his attempts to control the ball @entity93 — the two - goal star against @entity210 — @entity91 and @entity94 all worried the @entity188 defence			1
and it appeared the early pressure had paid dividends when @entity93 curled in a excellent near - post cross which @entity94 slid in to convert past @entity61			2
however , referee @entity108 correctly ruled it out for a very tight offside			0
@entity21 were dominant in midfield , with @entity90 and @entity219 establishing control , and were quick going forward			2
@entity88 in particular was targeted , first by @entity4 and later by @entity67 , whose challenge ended his match			2
@entity106 said : ‘ on two occasions @entity88 had very bad tackles and nothing was done			0
the referee was bad and this is the first time i speak about the referee as a coach			0
’ committed : @entity67 comes in late to win the ball from @entity88 and catches the @entity21 midfielder painful : @entity21 midfielder @entity88 ( c ) is taken off on a stretcher following a challenge from @entity67 on the run : @entity236 charges past @entity11 left back @entity65 as the winger starts an attack for @entity21 that said , @entity106 ’s displeasure had partly been incurred by the disallowed goal , a correct decision			1
though they were suffering , @entity11 had the best chance of the first half , @entity4 exchanging passes with @entity68 and hitting a superb volley that flew straight at @entity56			1
@entity62 should have done better on 40 minutes and @entity61 was forced into a sharp save from @entity94 ’s strike as the half ended			0
the pace waned after the break , yet @entity21 still made most of the running , with @entity91 and @entity94 keen to test @entity61 from long range			2
but @entity25 brought fresh verve			0
with 20 minutes left , he exchanged passes with @entity70 , who shot at @entity56			0
the goalkeeper saved but the ball rebounded off the striker and headed goalwards until @entity236 scrambled back to hook it off the line			0
@entity11 suddenly looked the more dangerous side			2
@entity66 hit a delightful strike from 25 yards that rebounded off the bar			0
then came the @entity265 corner , which saw @entity56 flap and @entity4 head home			2
@entity11 were in the ascendant and when @entity68 played in his cross and @entity25 pressured @entity47 into turning into his own net , the game was already done			1
the @entity6 has lost another @entity272 nation but @entity11 , in undemonstrative style , make steady progress .			1

@entity11 defeat @entity21 2 - 0 to progress to the @entity6 quarter - finals
former @entity280 midfielder @entity4 gave @entity11 the lead twelve minutes from time
@entity283 was *sealed* as @entity21 's former @entity284 defender @entity149 put the ball into his own net
@entity11 will face the winners of @entity289 vs @entity290 in the next round
