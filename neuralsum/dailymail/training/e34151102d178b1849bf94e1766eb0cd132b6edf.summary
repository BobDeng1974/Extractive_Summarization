by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 11:52 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 25 october 2013 campaigners are calling for a rationing ban to be lifted on a drug that gives an extra nine months of life to women with ovarian cancer			1
the drug , @entity10 , slows the advance of the disease , meaning that sufferers can experience extra months of quality life with their families , according to new trial data			1
doctors claim it is the first major advance for almost 20 years in tackling the disease , known as the ‘ silent killer ’ because women are often diagnosed too late for a cure			2
@entity10 , slows the advance of the disease , meaning that sufferers can experience extra months of quality life with their families , according to new trial data ovarian cancer affects almost 7,000 women a year and kills more than 4,000 women - the disease claims the lives of over 85 per cent of patients if found at a late stage when it has spread to other parts of the body			1
around 2,000 women a year could benefit from @entity10 , but earlier this year it was rejected for routine @entity36 use for ovarian cancer by the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) on cost grounds			1
the drug which costs around £ 25,000 for an average patient , has been made available in @entity42 through the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , although funding is due to run out in two years ’ time			1
the fund does not serve women in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			2
the new data found when women at highest risk of their cancer recurring received @entity10 in combination with chemotherapy , and then continued maintenance @entity10 , they lived on average 9.4 months longer			0
the survival average was 39.7 months compared with 30.3 months for women on chemotherapy alone			0
@entity10 is the first drug that has been shown to improve outcomes for women with advanced ovarian cancer in recent years and can halt the progression of first - line disease for an average of an additional six months , compared to chemotherapy alone			1
@entity69 was presented at the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) meeting in @entity72 from the international phase @entity75 study of 1,528 ovarian cancer patients , which included 46 trial centres in the @entity78			2
ovarian cancer affects almost 7,000 women a year and kills more than 4,000 women - the disease claims the lives of over 85 per cent of patients if found at a late stage study leader oncologist dr @entity84 , from @entity85 , said : ‘ the improvements in overall survival for women with high risk advanced ovarian cancer treated with @entity10 are a real breakthrough			1
‘ we already knew avastin delays the time to disease progression for women with this disease			0
‘ we now know @entity10 also significantly extends some patient ’s lives			0
@entity10 is well tolerated and although treatment has to continue for a total of 12 months this is acceptable to most patients			0
‘ ovarian cancer currently has the worst outcomes of all gynaecological cancers and halting disease progression for six months is an important step forward in treating this condition			0
’ @entity108 , chief executive of @entity110 charity said : ‘ this new survival data for women treated with @entity10 , who have the highest risk of their ovarian cancer recurring , is extremely positive			0
‘ @entity10 is the first new life - extending drug in 20 years , and could potentially benefit up to 2,000 women a year in the @entity78			1
we hope that @entity120 and @entity121 and the @entity122 will now reconsider their earlier negative decisions on the drug and work with the manufacturer to secure @entity36 access for all those who could benefit			0
‘ women in @entity42 are given access to the drug currently through the @entity43 , but those living in @entity49 , @entity48 and @entity50 have no such guarantees			1
‘ we believe women should get the drug according to clinical need and not their postcode , and we hope this new data will help strengthen equality of access			0
’ @entity10 , made by @entity139 which is also known as bevacizumab , is already widely used in patients with colon cancer , and doctors believe it will become a standard treatment for ovarian cancer			2
@entity10 is a ‘ targeted ’ cancer therapy that works by blocking the development of new blood vessels and interfering with the tumour ’s ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body .			0

@entity10 can give ovarian cancer patients an extra nine months of life
doctors call drug first *big* advance in treatment of the disease in 20 years
around 2,000 women a year could benefit from @entity10 in the @entity78
earlier this year it was rejected for routine use on the @entity36 due to cost
it costs about £ 25,000 for an average patient and is available in @entity42 but not in @entity48 , @entity49 or @entity50
