it found the extent of her vulnerabilities ' was not understood by professionals working with her ' and a found a wealth of ways agencies care of her was ' weak '			1
@entity18 , 17 , suffered an horrific death last may at the hands of her sadistic boyfriend @entity21 , who pleaded guilty to murder , two charges of assault , burglary , and arson at his trial last year and denied two charges of rape			1
he was ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years in jail when he appeared at @entity34			0
@entity18 , who was tortured and killed by her sadistic boyfriend , @entity21 , was ' not understood ' by agencies caring for her mr @entity36 had told @entity21 : ' this was a prolonged , merciless and terrible attack which must have been agonisingly painful for @entity18 before she died			1
' the case review was ordered immediately following the hearing			0
the report , which is anonymised - referring to @entity18 as ' @entity42 ' - contains 111 separate recommendations for changes to procedures , training and issuing extra guidance to staff			2
it found that although her murder at the hands of @entity21 could not reasonably have been forseen , service provision by the professional agencies that were supposed to look after her was ' diffuse and lacked co-ordination '			2
in the days before @entity18 ’s death , @entity21 had been sleeping rough hiding out on @entity58 after a warrant was issued for his arrest for burglary and arson			2
the report describes how @entity18 was helping police find him but had been warned about approaching the killer by a policewoman			0
however she ignored the advice			0
@entity69 pictures released after the trial showed the teenager walking along a leafy pathway at the hill as she went to meet him			0
she was dead a matter of hours later and her body discovered under twigs and leaves			0
the vulnerable teenager was murdered near @entity80 at @entity58 in @entity81 , @entity83 @entity82 the review charts how @entity18 had a difficult childhood and discloses that over the years , the youngster had contact with a large number of agencies and organisations			1
representative of health , education , social care , police , youth offending and housing services were all involved			0
but no multi-agency ' holistic ' assessment of her needs , characteristics and behaviour took place			0
the review found : in february 2012 , she was provided with accommodation as a homeless young person			1
an assessment should have taken place at this point to consider whether she was ' in need ' and required local authority accommodation			1
the report found that although @entity18 was found to have been neglected , there was almost no challenge to those responsible about the care they provided for her			1
the report says a such a plan is the basic requirement of child protection work and each member of the core group had individual , as well as collective , responsibility to @entity18 to ensure that this requirement was met			1
@entity18 was helping police find her boyfriend but had been warned about approaching the killer by a policewoman local @entity129 procedures and good practice guides were not systematically consulted and were not always applied as they were intended to be			2
a press release from @entity132 states : ' the review found that agencies working with [ @entity18 ] could not have foreseen what happened to her			1
' it continues : ' the overview report makes recommendations , all of which are now part of an action plan which will be reviewed and updated regularly by the @entity143			0
@entity144 , independent chairman of the board , said : ' i would like , on behalf of all members of the @entity143 , to extend our deepest condolences to @entity42 ’s family and anyone who knew her			0
' i know that a number of people who work for agencies associated with @entity42 ’s care knew her personally , and were greatly affected and saddened by her death			0
' the board have accepted the findings and recommendations of the review which was commissioned by the @entity143 following @entity42 ’s death			0
' we are already working on a number of areas which have been identified , where assessments , multi-agency work and information sharing were not of a sufficient standard to provide a framework for co-ordinated actions and interventions			2
' progress on these recommendations will be monitored and updated regularly by the @entity143 , and the results will contribute to child protection practice in @entity81 and will be used to inform further action and training .			1

@entity18 was tied to a tree , tortured and killed by her boyfriend
@entity1 found that care was ' weak ' for teenager
no child protection plan was formulated for vulnerable 17 - year - old
no assessment took account of her *developmental* progress and information contained in key records was not ***adequately*** appraised
@entity196 was made to family members , friends and *specialist* housing provision - but there was no accurate *evaluation* to ensure that safe care was being provided for her .
warning signs of *tension* in the systems that surrounded @entity18 were not always *heeded*
not recognising the extent of her vulnerabilities had a number of consequences ' which were *significant* . '
@entity18 *'s* relationships and behaviours were not always understood in the context of both her learning difficulties and of the *adversity* she had suffered in life .
the review found @entity18 ' was not ***adequately*** *diverted* from *harmful* activities . '
the local authority ' did not ***adequately*** consider its responsibilities under the @entity227 to provide accommodation to her . '
if @entity18 had been accommodated **properly** , a core assessment could have been *completed* and more thorough understanding of what needed to happen next could have been developed .
*promotion* of her *welfare* was ' generally weak '
no child protection plan was ever **properly** formulated .
