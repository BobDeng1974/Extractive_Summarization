by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 04:49 est , 2 january 2013 welfare handouts to those languishing on the dole have risen almost twice as fast as average wages over the past five years			2
out - of - work benefits have jumped in value by an astonishing 20 per cent since 2007 while wages have crept up by just 12 per cent , official figures released last night reveal			1
work and pensions secretary @entity9 said the figures proved that automatically increasing benefits by the rate of inflation , as has previously been the case , was ‘ not fair ’ on working people whose taxes fund the handouts			2
no work pays off : @entity19 has risen by 20 per cent , from £ 59.15 a week in 2007 to £ 71 ministers are now battling to reform the system and impose a 1 per cent cap on out - of - work benefit increases for the next three years , but face opposition from @entity25			1
mr @entity9 said yesterday : ‘ working people across the country have been tightening their belts after years of pay restraint while at the same time watching benefits increase			0
‘ the welfare state under @entity25 effectively trapped thousands of families into dependency as it made no sense to give up the certainty of a benefit payment in order to go back to work			0
’ the disparity between those in work and those on welfare is laid bare by the figures from the @entity45			0
while working families have faced a greater squeeze on their income from inflation , benefit claimants have been cushioned from the soaring cost of living by automatic inflation - linked rises in their payments			2
' not fair ' : work and pensions secretary @entity9 said the new 1 per cent cap on jobseekers ' handout increases was necessary to make the system fair towards taxpayers over the past five years , @entity19 rose by 20 per cent from £ 59.15 a week in 2007/08 to £ 71 in 2012/13			1
last year alone , out - of - work benefits rose by 5.2 per cent , while average earnings increased by 1.7 per cent – just one - third the rate			1
meanwhile , across the whole economy , weekly earnings went up from £ 392 in 2007 to £ 441 in 2012			2
ministers argue that the figures underline their case that @entity25 ’s welfare system provided a disincentive to claimants to take a job			2
a new @entity73 scheme , to be introduced in stages from april , will replace most existing out - of - work benefits and is designed to ensure that it always pays to work			0
unifying taxes and benefits into one system , it will also prevent total benefits from exceeding the average wage			0
the new figures will also strengthen the case for the government ’s decision to cap benefit increases to 1 per cent			0
unfair increase : whilst state handouts for jobless have risen by 20 per cent , wages are only up by 12 per cent since 2007 chancellor @entity92 faced criticism from @entity25 and the unions for the decision , announced in his @entity96 last month			1
@entity25 has vowed to vote against the 1 per cent rise when the measure is debated in @entity99 early this year			1
but ministers insist it would be unaffordable to allow benefits to continue to outstrip wages , as well as unfair			0
private sector pay has stagnated during the recession , while the public sector has been subject to a three - year pay freeze			1
@entity25 argues that the new benefits cap will hit millions of working families on low incomes whose tax credits will also be capped			0
the party ’s work and pensions spokesman , @entity111 , said the move would mean some part - time workers would be better off on benefits			1
mr @entity9 said the new @entity73 system would ensure fairness , adding : ‘ this government is restoring fairness to the system and @entity73 will ensure it always pays to be in work			0
’ mr @entity92 is determined to shave a further £ 10billion from the welfare bill , on top of an £ 18billion reduction in benefits already in place , after a more downbeat than expected economic forecast			0
the cost of increasing benefits in line with inflation since the 2008 recession has been £ 6.3billion			0
in 2009 alone , the @entity25 government raised means - tested benefits – not pensions – by 6.3 per cent			1
overall , more than £ 90billion is spent on working age welfare every year , the same as the entire education budget .			1

@entity19 up 20 per cent from £ 59.15 a week in 2007/08 to £ 71
in the same five - year period wages only rose by 12 per cent
