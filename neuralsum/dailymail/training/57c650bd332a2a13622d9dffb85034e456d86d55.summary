by @entity0 deadly : men are usually much more affected than women by coronaries countless lives could be saved by a blood test which costs just £ 10 by detecting a heart attack in 30 minutes			1
the groundbreaking test , developed by @entity9 scientists , could provide relief to those suffering with chest pains by quickly checking for coronaries			1
it works by detecting a small protein which is released after a heart attack called @entity17 and could dramatically cut down on wait times and free hospital beds			1
at present , the blood test to detect a heart attack takes over six hours and the long wait time can lead to the patient suffering from cardiac damage and even death			1
dr @entity26 , consultant in emergency medicine has carried out successful trials of the test at @entity30			1
dr @entity26 told @entity32 : ' many patients with chest pain are admitted for hours , even days , for further tests but most do n't have a heart problem			2
‘ with this new test we could bring instant peace of mind to those not suffering a heart attack and prioritise those who are			1
' according to the @entity46 , coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the @entity9 and worldwide			0
it 's responsible for around 74,000 deaths in the @entity9 each year and about 1 in 5 men and 1 in 8 women die from the disease			0
however , while coronaries can be spotted on an @entity55 , a blood test to measure a protein called troponin is needed			2
in the @entity9 , an estimated 2.7 million people live with the condition and 2 million people are affected by angina , which is the most common symptom of coronary heart disease			0
coronaries affect men more than women but things change by the age of 50 when the chances of developing the disease become similar for both			0
hospital : the test could dramatically cut down on hospital wait times and free hospital beds sooner when patients visit @entity78 with chest pains , doctors often recommend that they are admitted to hospital for tests to rule out a heart attack			1
yet , while this is the most common reason for hospital admission , most do not actually have a heart attack			2
it can also go undetected , leaving some patients unwittingly missing vital treatment			0
but a good indicator of a problem is the protein @entity17 , which shows up when the heart cells are actually being damaged			0
the new test has been developed by @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96			0
medical director @entity97 said that cardiac tests are not currently as sensitive as clinicians would like them to be , leaving many patients in hospital , using valuable resources .			0

the ground breaking test has been developed by @entity9 scientists
it can detect a heart attack in just 30 minutes and help *diagnose* patients
successful trials have already been carried out on patients in the @entity9
at present , a blood test to detect heart attacks , takes over six hours
