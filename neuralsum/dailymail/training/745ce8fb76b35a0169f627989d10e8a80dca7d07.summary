by @entity0 after @entity2 sealed a permanent deal for a club record £ 28million , lifelong fan @entity0 of @entity1 looks back on a successful summer ... and looks forward to a bright future			1
in this era of soaring transfer fees , the £ 28million deal that @entity2 negotiated with @entity7 for @entity8 almost appears modest			2
at close to double the fee paid for @entity13 in 2008 , it represents a quantum leap from the last four transfer windows , during which @entity2 did not spend a penny on a first - team acquisition			0
in shattering the club ’s record transfer fee for an incoming player , @entity2 have delivered a statement of intent to the @entity23			2
@entity24 : @entity8 joined @entity2 on a permanent deal after a successful loan at @entity27 @entity29 return marks significant day in @entity2 history it presents further signs that one of @entity37 football ’s sleeping giants may finally be awakening from its slumbers			1
and this in the same week as its brightest hope , @entity42 , followed @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 in putting pen to paper on a long - term contract extension			1
but how much is left in the @entity27 coffers to bring in further reinforcements remains to be seen			0
the @entity2 ’ capture of @entity8 and @entity53 , another of last season ’s impressive temporary signings , illustrates the power of the much - maligned loan market and the effective way in which @entity44 has used it			1
the leader of the pack : signing @entity53 ( centre ) was a blinding bit of business by @entity44 together with the £ 4m paid for midfielder @entity66 , @entity2 have committed £ 34m this summer just to bring senior squad numbers back to where they were when the 2013 - 14 campaign finished in may			1
but they are yet to replace the mercurial talents of another loanee , @entity72			0
by his own admission , @entity44 needs at least 27 players at his disposal in order to cope with the extra demands that will be placed on his squad by @entity2 ’s involvement in @entity81			0
he hit his target of signing a genuine no 9 in the form of @entity8 , and nailed down his options in the vital defensive midfield anchor role that is central to his team ’s attacking style			0
new addition : @entity90 international @entity66 ( right ) will add all - action performances to @entity2 the @entity92 has the core of his first - choice side settled before the season has kicked off , instead of having to wait until the last minute in the transfer window to acquire key components			2
importantly , he now has the leeway to round out his squad with a mix of affordable permanent signings and targeted loan acquisitions that will add more talent in forward areas - without putting excessive strain on the bank balance			0
it is a necessarily prudent transfer strategy , one that has n’t always been popular among supporters but which has helped @entity2 avoid the boom - and - bust approach that has been so damaging to the likes of @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 in recent years			0
if , in combination with @entity44 ’s enterprising management , it results in a long - awaited top - four finish and vaulting the club back to its former place among @entity37 ’s elite , it would be rich reward for years of patience and frustration at looking through what once seemed like an impenetrable glass ceiling			1
making his point : @entity44 enjoyed a glorious first season at @entity27 , just missing out on a top - four finish			2

the @entity8 deal sends out a statement to the @entity23
he joins the likes of @entity42 , @entity45 and @entity46 in committing to the club
@entity53 also signed a permanent deal , *highlighting* @entity44 *'s* *excellent* use of the loan *system*
@entity66 joined for £ 4m from @entity144 to *strengthen* the midfield
the summer has left some @entity2 fans *dreaming* of a top - four finish , which was *unimaginable* in the not - too *distant* past
