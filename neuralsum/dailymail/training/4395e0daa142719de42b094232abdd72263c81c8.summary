by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 04:52 est , 9 january 2014 being told a pill will help makes it work better			0
a study found that migraine tablets are better at easing pain if patients believe they are effective			2
even dummy drugs provide more benefit if expectations are raised			1
the researchers behind the @entity13 study of @entity15 pills said that information is as important as medication in reducing migraine pain			1
@entity19 : the researchers said the patient receiving information is as important as the medication itself they said : ‘ one of the many implications for our findings is that when doctors set patient ’s ’ expectations high , @entity15 – or potentially other migraine drugs – becomes more effective			1
‘ increased effectiveness means shorter migraine attacks and shorter migraine attacks mean that less medication is needed			2
’ the research team looked at how much headache pain 66 migraine patients suffered during an attack			2
they then gave them envelopes with pills to be taken during each of their next six attacks			1
three of the envelopes contained @entity15 , a migraine drug used in the @entity49 as well as the @entity50			0
these were either labelled correctly , in an attempt to raise expectations , wrongly labelled as placebo , to avoid raising hope , or marked neutrally as ‘ maxalt or placebo ’			0
the same labelling system was used on a second three envelopes which contained placebo pills			0
experiment : the patients in the survey were given six envelopes , some containing medication and other containing a placebo this effect was especially strong if the patients thought they were taking proper pills – but even those knowingly taking a dummy pill felt better than when they took nothing			1
and , to the researchers ’ surprise , when @entity15 was labelled as a placebo it worked no better than a dummy drug marked as being the real thing the findings , published in the journal @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , add to evidence that the placebo effect – the idea that having faith in a medication increases the chances of it working - is real			1
researcher professor @entity88 said : ‘ our discovery showing that patients ’ reports of pain were nearly identical when they were told that an active drug was a placebo as when they were told that a placebo was an active drug demonstrates that the placebo effect is an unacknowledged partner for powerful pain expectations			2
’ with the @entity15 working less well if the patients believed it was a dummy drug , the researchers said that doctors might want to avoid stressing the possibility of side effects and other negatives to patients			1
however , they acknowledged that withholding information is fraught with ethical issues			0
it could lead to an erosion of trust between patient and doctor			0
the research team expect similar results would be obtained for other migraine treatments			0
however , the pattern may be different for conditions that appear symptomless to the patient , such as high cholesterol .			0

researchers gave patients a *mixture* of medication and placebos
@entity19 had an *affect* when sufferers thought they took stronger pills
dummy drugs were even beneficial when expectations were raised
