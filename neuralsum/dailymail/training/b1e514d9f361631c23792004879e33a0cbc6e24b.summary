click here to follow @ ralphellis56 @entity1 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from the international weekend and also the programme of matches in the @entity7			0
@entity8 won his 18th cap when @entity10 brought him on in @entity11 but has still never played 90 minutes in an @entity13 shirt			1
that has to change at some time because the @entity17 winger ’s ability to run at people is becoming more and more valuable at international level			0
he changed the game at @entity21 in the second half against @entity23 , and in the 29 minutes he played in @entity24 he created three chances for team mates – more than anybody except @entity28 ( five ) and @entity29 ( three ) managed in the entire game			0
@entity8 energised a lacklustre @entity13 when he came on against @entity11 on sunday 2			1
even @entity31 can muck up from the penalty spot when he changes his technique			2
of the 40 goals that the @entity37 great had tucked away from 12 yards for @entity38 up until march this year , 27 of them went to the goalkeeper ’s left			0
but his miss for his country in the 2 - 0 friendly defeat against @entity44 was the second recent failure when he has gone for the opposite side of the goal			0
this one was saved by @entity44 keeper @entity49 diving low to his right – and in september @entity31 missed altogether for @entity38 against @entity51 when he aimed for the top corner on that side			0
@entity31 paid the price for changing his penalty - taking technique in @entity57 's friendly loss to @entity44 3			1
@entity58 is far too good to be sat on the bench every week – but that has been his fate at club level for the last two seasons			2
the 27 - year - old @entity65 goalkeeper was brilliant for @entity66 against @entity67 on friday night , making eight saves including a couple that were genuine world class			1
since a loan spell at @entity71 that was designed to get him fit after cruciate knee ligament injuries ended a year ago he ’s played just one @entity7 game – @entity65 ’s last of the season at @entity76 - following his £ 3m january move to @entity78 from @entity79			2
@entity58 makes a save during @entity66 ' 0 - 0 draw with @entity67 at @entity82 on friday night 4			1
@entity83 took a month after arriving at @entity84 to get on the score sheet for the first time with the winner against @entity88			2
his next goal has n’t taken so long , though – the @entity90 scored for his country in a 3 - 0 friendly against @entity92 in @entity93			1
top strikers tend to get their goals in bursts , so @entity97 will be keeping his fingers crossed that ’s true of the man on loan from @entity102			0
@entity83 celebrates his goal for @entity104 in their friendly win over @entity92 in @entity93 5			1
@entity107 defender @entity106 is another whose career has stalled at club level – he ’s yet to be picked for a @entity111 game since new boss @entity112 took over			2
the 34 - year - old can win headers in both boxes , though , as he proved with one of the @entity118 goals from an @entity120 corner that put @entity122 ’s team top of @entity123 @entity112 knows that already , though			1
@entity106 also scored from a corner for his club against @entity127 in one of the two @entity129 matches he has started			0
@entity106 celebrates after opening the scoring for @entity118 against the @entity131 6			2
@entity132 is best known for rugged defending but the @entity133 and former @entity84 star can play a bit as well			0
the 33 - year - old was the @entity137 ’s best passer with every one of the 64 balls he played finding a team mate during the 7 - 0 romp over @entity142			1
it is n’t only against the minnows of international football that @entity132 can use the ball , though			0
his average for @entity133 this campaign is 44 passes a game , with a near 90 per cent completion rate			0
@entity151 was flawless with his passing in the @entity154 's 7 - 0 win over @entity142 7			1
@entity156 - born @entity155 is emerging as the scoring sensation of the season with @entity159 already for @entity160 in @entity161			1
@entity155 , 26 , got both his side ’s goals in the 3 - 2 defeat at leaders @entity166 and already has two more than he got all of last campaign , following his move to play for @entity170 following a spell with @entity172			2
@entity173 has n’t got too many worries in the goal getting department following the 7 - 0 win over @entity142 , but it sounds like six footer doyle could be another to put on his radar			0
@entity160 's @entity155 celebrates one of his two goals in saturday 's 3 - 2 defeat at @entity166 8			1
@entity184 might be bottom of the table at the moment , but the club ’s reputation for finding and developing young talent shows no signs of waning			0
@entity194 ’s team registered only their second win of the season against @entity197 thanks to a brilliant free kick by 17 - year - old midfielder @entity199			1
the @entity201 - born starlet signed a three - year contract at @entity203 in april and is rated as one of the best of the current crop of youngsters emerging through the club ’s @entity208			2
@entity199 ( left ) celebrates after scoring with a brilliant free - kick in @entity184 's win over @entity197 9			1
the first act of new @entity214 chairman @entity213 when he took over in july was to sack manager @entity215 and bring in @entity216 , the choice of his chief executive @entity218			2
former @entity219 chief exec @entity218 wanted the 38 - year - old because they had worked together before that at @entity107 and according to @entity213 he ‘ needed his own man ’			1
that relationship is coming under increasing strain with the side still in the @entity228 relegation zone following a 5 - 1 hammering at @entity229			1
@entity213 , who took over @entity214 shortly after ending 11 years running the private equity arm of @entity231 , has made it clear he wants the club in the promotion hunt this season			0
@entity236 manager @entity216 is feeling the strain after saturday 's 5 - 1 loss at @entity229 10			1
@entity239 is just 34 but earning a reputation in @entity243 as one of the game ’s bright young bosses – and the way his @entity241 team won at @entity248 to open a nine point gap at the top of the @entity251 tells you why			1
promotion rivals @entity254 and @entity172 have both failed to win at the @entity256 this season and @entity258 blasted the plastic surface as being ‘ horrible ’			0
@entity260 spotted that @entity248 make extra cash by renting out their stadium to the public – and so persuaded his bosses to fork out £ 320 to hire it for a whole day ’s training on wednesday			0
three days later they returned , with no fear of the plastic , and took three points thanks to @entity272 ’s 87th minute goal			0
@entity241 boss @entity239 gives out instructions during their win at @entity248 on saturday			0

@entity8 *deserves* more game time for @entity13
@entity31 *messed* up his penalty after changing his technique
@entity66 hero @entity58 is far too good to be *warming* the bench
@entity83 scored again in @entity104 's friendly with @entity92
@entity106 showed his *aerial* ability for @entity118
@entity151 's passing was *absolutely* flawless for the @entity137
@entity160 's @entity155 already has 15 goals for the season
@entity184 have another young star in 17 - year - old @entity199
@entity216 feeling the heat at @entity214 after 5 - 1 *humbling*
hearts were *fantastic* on plastic was they won at @entity248
