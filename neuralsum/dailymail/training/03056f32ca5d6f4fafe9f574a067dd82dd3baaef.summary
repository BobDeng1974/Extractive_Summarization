by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 21:55 est , 28 october 2013 nestled in a wooded valley which is home to rabbits , deer and even a holy well , @entity1 seems the ideal location for a holistic retreat			2
but the peace and quiet of the sleepy @entity10 village has been shattered by a war of words between a band of well - heeled residents – led by a millionaire author – and the couple behind the ‘ alternative campsite ’ and adjoining ‘ house of healing ’			1
@entity20 , 67 , and his wife @entity21 , 63 , opened @entity22 on the edge of the south @entity25 community a decade ago			1
objection : @entity0 and @entity27 deny their @entity28 hosts rowdy raves and drunken revellers claims : site owners @entity20 , and his wife @entity21 say @entity22 attracts people looking for a quiet setting the centre , which boasts its own stone circle , plays host to yoga teachers , pilates instructors , meditation groups and song and dance sessions			1
but their closest neighbour , author @entity45 , 73 , who wrote a best - selling memoir , against my @entity47 , and novel @entity49 , is taking legal action against the couple after they were granted retrospective planning permission for the 30 - pitch campsite earlier this month			1
some of the village ’s 320 residents are even threatening to boycott donations to the local 12th century church , @entity56 ’s , after mr @entity20 suggested his centre enjoyed a ‘ symbiotic relationship ’ with the church			1
mr @entity45 , whose £ 1million home lies 400 yards from the campsite , is attempting to get a judicial review to overturn the council ’s decision			1
the former chairman of defunct bookseller @entity70 has lived in the village with wife @entity73 for 30 years			2
he said : ‘ i have been friends with @entity0 and @entity21 for many , many years and i even persuaded him to buy the land			2
‘ everything was fine , and we had no opposition to the holistic centre but the campsite is causing noise which is very intrusive to us			1
complaints : author and publisher @entity45 , pictured , claims his tranquility is being ruined by the neighbouring holistic peace retreat permission : the @entity22 overlooking the rolling @entity10 hills was granted permission to hold weddings in its grounds ‘ if we sit on our terrace , and with a prevailing wind , we can hear conversations from the campsite quite clearly as well as children playing			1
‘ it does not fit with the atmosphere of a quiet village in the @entity10			0
’ mrs @entity98 , 70 , added : ‘ the @entity99 were good friends of ours and we are sad that it ’s come to this			0
‘ it ’s been a spoiler in the village , there ’s no friendship any more			0
’ another resident , @entity108 solicitor @entity107 , 55 , complained of ‘ terrible noise pollution ’ over the years from ‘ rowdy campers , chanting and singing ’			0
she added : ‘ one of the worst things is that people come into the village and park all over the place			0
‘ it got particularly bad in 2011 which was what prompted us all to complain			0
’ the retreat is situated where a @entity123 castle once stood , although now only a shallow moat remains			0
idyllic : @entity22 has been run from this site in the @entity10 village of @entity1 by @entity20 , 67 , and his wife @entity21 , 63 , for the past 10 years @entity130 : @entity22 is set in the middle of picturesque countryside mr @entity20 said initially , only a handful of people camped each year – within rules which allowed camping on the site for less than 28 days a year without planning permission			1
but the popularity of the site took off in 2011 after it was featured in a national newspaper article on ‘ cool campsites ’ and neighbours began to complain about noise caused by groups of guests drinking late into the night and playing loud music			1
the @entity146 said they rebranded the site as a ‘ quiet ’ destination , where radios and instruments of any kind were banned – except , of course , the acoustic guitar			1
the couple , who have six children , also introduced a policy only to admit singles , couples or families – barring large groups			0
tensions : the red circle shows where @entity22 sits in relation to the @entity164 and campsite ( blue ) , the home of author @entity168 ( green ) , the local parish church ( yellow ) and the home of solicitor @entity107 ( orange ) they denied guests parked in the village and said vehicles were left alongside the tents			1
their retrospective planning application for a 30 - pitch campsite – including four furnished bell tents – was approved by @entity179			2
mr @entity20 , who runs a water purifying company , said : ‘ we took full responsibility for the noisy guests we had in 2011			0
' the problem was we were getting lots of couples booking who turned out to be part of larger groups			0
‘ since then we have imposed an 11pm noise curfew and banned virtually all forms of music			0
the council have had no complaints about noise from our site since			2
conversion : @entity22 had been a junk yard , pictured in 1995 , before it was taken over by @entity20 and his wife @entity21 ‘ our holistic retreat attracts the sort of people who want to be quiet			1
the only noise now is the sound of children playing during summer weekends			0
’ mrs @entity27 said the retreat was used mostly by middle - aged couples and walkers wanting to ‘ enjoy the countryside in peace and quiet ’			0
@entity213 , which is responding to the seven claims for a judicial review , refused to comment			2
a spokesman said : ‘ it would be inappropriate for us to comment while legal proceedings are continuing			0

owners deny @entity22 is a disturbance
author @entity45 , 73 , claims the centre spoils his tranquility
he has called for planning permission for the site to be overturned
