by @entity0 there is no doubt that older women are now living dramatically different and more exciting lives			2
and perhaps no one illustrates this point better than @entity7 , who earlier this week opened up about the inner workings of her relationship with a man 23 years younger than her			1
she has been with @entity11 , 47 , for more than a decade , and seems to suggest that this success is partly due to the fact they are in an open relationship			1
for 70 - year - old @entity16 confesses that she 's not that fussed about fidelity			2
' at my age , loyalty and trust are more important than monogamy			1
while women are fertile , i think sexual loyalty is crucial			1
but as time goes on you shrug a bit			2
' @entity7 , 70 , with 47 - year - old lover @entity11 well , i did n't shrug when i read this			1
i do n't see many of my friends shrugging either , when they 're unfortunate enough to find incriminating evidence of ' playing away ' in their partner 's phone or pockets			2
i say this as a single woman in her 60s , who has been thus since my partner , architect @entity39 , died more than a decade ago			1
i admit i 've no idea if i shall have a relationship again , but one thing is certain : i most certainly would n't settle for a relationship which was deceitful and uncommitted			1
for even though @entity39 and i never got as far as living together , we were partners on and off for about 10 years			2
we split up twice and i loathed seeing him with other women , even when i was dating someone else			2
happily , very happily , in the last few years it became a monogamous relationship and we finally reached a plateau of understanding and trust			1
for the brutal fact of the matter is that infidelity and open relationships never work if you are emotionally attached to someone , no matter how old you are			1
the laid - back attitude to fidelity shown by @entity7 , and also by 60 - year - old @entity61 , who has written a new confessional book about a wild year spent sleeping around with 15 much younger men , shows a strange lack of self - esteem and principle			1
it is not a sign of emancipation to accept your partner having other girlfriends , but a faustian pact of the flesh			2
@entity7 with her estranged husband television dramatist @entity74 i admit when you hear it discussed by @entity78 , it sounds like a clever and thoroughly pragmatic way of keeping a man interested			1
and also a way of keeping the tap flowing for lots of enthusiastic sex at an age when many women are happily resigned to celibacy			0
there must be an immense price to pay , however , for these cougars			0
open relationships are emotionally draining and painful - not for nothing are they one of the great theatrical themes of all time			1
any woman with children would surely find such an arrangement too painful as she and their father have so much shared experience invested in their partnership			0
and even with no children , the experience of an ' open relationship ' would be utterly brutal			1
it takes a supremely confident woman not to have her esteem battered by the inevitable imaginings of where you fall in your lover 's pecking order and your body being compared to other , younger bodies			0
it can only end in tears			0
perhaps it really is miss @entity7 who is setting the ground rules			1
maybe her pragmatism in allowing him freedom - they do not live together - works very well for her , an independent woman reported to be worth Â £ 15â € ‰ million			0
she has two marriages and two children under her belt			0
she looks like she ' has it all '			0
but what if @entity7 wanted more ? what if she wanted @entity11 to move in ? where would the power balance shift then ? not in @entity7 's favour , i would guess			1
the novelist suggests that the secret to a long and happy relationship could be infidelity as we age , intimacy and companionship become even more vital than in our youth			1
i can see why many women - and men - of a certain age would consider tolerating countless humiliations just in order to have someone in their lives			0
when i asked a friend of mine , who is around my age , what she thought of miss @entity7 's arrangement she said : ' does she wrap his @entity157 presents ? ' - code in ' @entity159 ' for a proper relationship			1
women like @entity7 and @entity61 may have lost sight of such minor but telling acts of love			1
they are so busy being sexy and independent i wonder what they do on sunday nights			0
for it is on this night of the week that i miss my deceased partner most			0
it was n't so much the nights we were out at parties - i can manage those on my own perfectly well , thank you - but the companionable evenings in , when we would cook supper and watch an undemanding tv programme together			0
it was very cosy and comforting			0
companionship is the name of the game as we age and all my friends who have lost partners tell me that it is this they miss most			0
could i enjoy such intimacy with someone if i knew he had other options the following night ? i do n't think so			0
there have been such dramatic changes in the lives of older women recently			0
a decade ago , women in their 60s and 70s spent their time at the bridge table and on the golf course			2
now a great number of us continue to work			0
attitudes to sex have also changed beyond all recognition : the bedroom is not just a place to sleep , but just as much of a playground as it was before children came along			0
but equally we lose sight of the important things in life at our peril			2
what baby boomers like @entity209 and @entity7 have not worked out is how they want to spend their fourth age			1
when they become frail , will they still be content with no - strings relationships ? the final leg of our journey still needs to be travelled			0
but who with ? the young man from the gym or the contemporary who shares the same jokes , the same language and who will pick you up when you fall ?			0

@entity7 has been with toy *boy* @entity11 for over a decade
the novelist *implies* that this is down to an open relationship
she says loyalty and trust are more important than monogamy
