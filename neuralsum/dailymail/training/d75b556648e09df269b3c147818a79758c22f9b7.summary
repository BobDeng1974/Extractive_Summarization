by @entity0 published : 04:56 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 15 april 2013 it could be the next big revolution in electronics - gadgets you can simply fold up to put in your pocket			0
manufacturers have already given us a glimpse of the technology , with @entity10 showing off a ' foldable ' phone			1
experts say the technology , which could lead to virtually unbreakable gadgets , could soon be seen in everything from @entity17 's much - rumoured @entity16 to larger tablets			1
experts say the technology could soon become commonplace flexible displays are made by depositing organic light emitting diodes on a flexible plastic surface			1
regular led displays are usually made on a glass surface , but substituting that for a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate makes it possible to manufacture screens that are both flexible and lightweight			1
one possible mass - production method might use a technique similar to inkjet printing			0
the touted arrival this year of wearable gadgets such as computer displays strapped to wrists and in wrap - around glasses is just a step towards a bigger revolution in screens — those that can be bent , folded and rolled up , experts say			1
once freed from today 's relatively heavy , breakable and fixed glass displays , tomorrow 's devices may look very different , with screens that can be rolled out , attached to uneven surfaces , or even stretched			1
but there 's still some way to go			0
' it becomes a product designer 's paradise — once the technology is sorted out , ' says @entity60 , who analyzes display technology for @entity62			0
there is no shortage of prototypes			0
@entity66 's @entity10 this year showed off a display screen that extends from the side of a device — but obstacles remain : overcoming technical issues , figuring out how to mass produce parts cheaply , and coming up with devices compelling enough for gadget buyers			1
screen technology — with the global small display market expected to more than double to around $ 72 billion by 2016 , according to @entity78 — is still dominated by liquid crystal displays ( lcds ) , which require a backlight and sit between two sheets of glass , making the screen a major contributor to the weight of a device , from laptops to tablets			1
' most of the weight in a tablet is the glass structure in the display and the support structure around it to prevent it from cracking , ' said @entity95 , a former engineer at @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
@entity80 's dominance is already under threat from lighter @entity101 ( @entity101 ) that do n't need backlighting , are brighter , offer a wider viewing angle and better color contrast — and can be printed onto a few layers			0
@entity108 's @entity107 , which can be as thin as a sheet of paper and is flexible enough to be wrapped around a device or structure			2
initially , @entity107 will be used as a coating for products like solar panels , but it is eventually expected to create curved products			2
however , some manufacturers are already creating lighter and more flexible glass			1
@entity108 , whose toughened gorilla glass became the screen of choice for many smartphones , will provide phones with curved glass edges as soon as this year			1
it is also now promoting @entity107 , which can be as thin as a sheet of paper and is flexible enough to be wrapped around a device or structure			2
initially , @entity107 will be used as a coating for products like solar panels , but it is eventually expected to create curved products			2
a concept for @entity17 's @entity137 shows a design based on the @entity139 a key selling point for @entity107 is more efficient production which involves so - called roll - to - roll manufacturing , like a printing press , rather than today 's more costly batch manufacturing			1
but the commercialization of @entity107 as a flexible product is some way off , @entity145 , who heads @entity108 's glass technology group , told @entity150 - and glass has its limits			1
' you can bend it , but you ca n't keep flexing it , ' said @entity156 , a @entity157 consultant who has worked on several start - ups related to display technology , and holds patents in the field			0
this means that while glass is likely to continue to play a leading role in devices with curved displays , screens that users can bend , fold and roll will likely be plastic			2
but plastic is not as robust as glass			2
' as soon as you introduce plastic substrates you have all kinds of issues with sensitivity to the environment , ' says @entity156			0
so while oled and plastic would seem to be companion technologies they create an extra problem when laid together : they need so - called barrier films to prevent the various layers from leaking oxygen and moisture			0
a @entity10 concept shows off a tablet - sized screen that can be rolled up even after the success of @entity187 , popularized by the @entity188 , @entity108 is having to work hard to prepare customers for @entity191 displays			1
@entity145 said customers want thinner devices and easier to produce glass , but @entity107 requires a completely different manufacturing set - up			1
' when we talk about commercializing @entity107 a big part of our development activity is enabling the ecosystem to handle what is essentially a brand new material , ' @entity145 added			0
' nobody 's accustomed to working with glass that bends and moves			2
it 's a new material			0
the ecosystem needs to be trained to handle it			0
' he sees demand , particularly from video gamers , for @entity191 - based curved screens , but remains less convinced about rollable or foldable screens			0
' @entity213 is in the near future			0
' as far as flexible , bendable , fold - upable goes , i see that further out and i 'm not even sure that 's a viable product , ' he said			2
@entity10 's ' skin ' a concept for a bendable mobile for companies with deep pockets , like @entity10 , this can mean building prototypes such as those displayed at international technology shows			1
but that does n't guarantee success in selling products			0
@entity232 , for example , promoted flexible oled displays back in 2007			2
' six years later they 've not come up with anything , ' says @entity236 , senior scientist at @entity238 's @entity237			0
' if @entity10 's going to really drive this the application really needs to drive people and make them want it			1
' this slows down the process			0
in late 2011 , @entity10 told analysts it planned to introduce flexible displays into handsets ' some time in 2012 , hopefully the earlier part than later , ' but a year later the company said the technology was still " under development			1
" in an investment note last month @entity252 said that while @entity10 may introduce " unbreakable " screens this year , it did n't expect to see flexible displays in @entity10 devices until 2014 - 15			1
ultimately , teasing out the technical problems may be only half the battle			0
' this is the eternal question of the speciality materials industry , ' says @entity262 , @entity263 - based head of marketing for @entity268 glass maker @entity267 's @entity266 glass			0
' you have something , a material , and you 're looking for an application			0

@entity10 and @entity17 both *believed* to be *experimenting* with ' flexible glass '
projects expected to produce screen that can be rolled or folded up when not in use
