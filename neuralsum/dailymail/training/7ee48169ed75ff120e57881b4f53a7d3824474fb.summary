seemingly aware that potential customers may want to spend various lengths of time with his partner , @entity9 's offer is broken into various pricing categories : £ 1 an hour , £ 5 per day and £ 50 per month			1
according to posters on @entity50 , he claimed his girlfriend was a willing participant in the scheme , which was advertised online under the slogan : ' sharing girlfriend for pocket money			1
' happy : @entity9 claims his 21 - year - old girlfriend @entity20 ( pictured ) is a willing participant in the scheme sales pitch : @entity9 was photographed outside @entity10 as crowds of interested men gathered around			2
he told them ' no funny business ' could take place on dates he suggested focused on dinner or studying information : @entity9 invited passers - by to log on to a nearby wifi network in order to check out images of his girlfriend and read a short biography on her ( right )			1
he is hoping to raising funds to buy the new @entity7 6 ( left ) alongside the new keyboards , messaging tools and photo features of @entity75 , @entity33 has also updated the software 's security features			0
in an open letter to customers , @entity33 ’s chief executive @entity78 announced the firm has changed the way encryption works in @entity75			0
as a result the company can no longer bypass a user ’s passcode , making it impossible for it to hand over data to law enforcement officers and governments			2
this is the case , even if a search warrant is served on the firm or customer			0
these new rules , however , only apply to data stored on the device , locked by a passcode , and @entity33 will be able to access data stored on @entity100 if presented with a warrant for it			0
