by @entity0 published : 19:02 est , 11 november 2012 updated : 13:21 est , 12 november 2012 most of the @entity3 high command would like to see @entity4 skinned alive for her temerity in abandoning @entity6 for the thrills of reality tv			1
so , no doubt many will have been delighted last night at the look of horror across her face as she discovered what she had let herself in for on i 'm a celebrity ... @entity15 ! the @entity3 mp appeared shocked on finding out that contestants would be forced to empty their own toilet in the @entity19 jungle			1
@entity20 camp instructions she said : ' oh my @entity22 ! we have to empty the toilet out with our hands			2
the former nurse took charge of the camp and later said she was ' worn out ' after delegating tasks to her team mates			1
viewers saw mrs @entity4 justify her appearance in the jungle to fellow camper @entity31 from tv show made in @entity32			1
she said : ' sixteen million people watching this show			2
that 's how politics should be			2
sixteen million people do not watch prime minister 's @entity51 or @entity51			2
' her publicity point was rammed home when former @entity57 star @entity56 wasted no time stripping to her bikini to get in the camp shower – a scene that has become customary among the fame - hungry in the tv jungle			1
tired : mrs @entity4 looks shattered despite the show only just getting started order ! the @entity3 mp told her fellow contestants she is ' worn out ' back with mrs @entity4 , mr @entity31 asked the politician if she would ever like to be prime minister			1
' @entity22 no , ' she said			0
' never in a million years			0
' later she asked former darts champion @entity70 how he had voted in the last election			0
he responded : ' i do n't vote			0
' yesterday a blog that mrs @entity4 wrote before going into the jungle revealed she fully knew her appearance on the show was likely to cause trouble			1
published yesterday , it began with the words : ' g'day			0
is it outrage back home ? ' she then added : ' i think many may have guessed that i am a bit of an anti-politics politician			0
' the @entity85 mp caused fury last week when she left for the @entity88 show without telling her local association or getting permission from the chief whip			2

shocked : mrs @entity4 also appeared upset when she found out they would be sleeping on the ground day job : mrs @entity4 could face the wrath of her constituents for ditching @entity98 for the jungle however , mrs @entity4 remains defiant , claiming that she had informed the @entity100 that she would be away for a month			1
she also said she will be donating her parliamentary salary for the period she is away to children 's charities			0
