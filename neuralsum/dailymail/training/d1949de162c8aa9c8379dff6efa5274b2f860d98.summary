text that was hidden on a damaged copy of the 1215 @entity2 for more than 250 years has been uncovered			1
the near - invisible words were revealed using groundbreaking multispectral imaging work at the @entity5 in @entity6			1
this work has been completed by library 's conservators and scientists in preparation for next year ’s 800th anniversary of the sealing of the ancient charter			1
the manuscript appears a sandy colour in natural light ( pictured ) , but the text ' appears ' under special light conditions ( shown in black and white ) the burnt copy of the @entity2 is one of four original manuscripts from 1215 which survive			1
the @entity2 was the first document imposed upon a @entity29 of @entity30 by a group of his subjects , the feudal barons , in an attempt to limit his powers by law and protect their rights			1
the scanned copy of the @entity2 was damaged in the @entity40 fire in 1731			1
staff at the library attempted to preserve it using 19th century techniques , by flattening it out and mounting it , which left some text almost impossible to see , @entity41 , an imaging scientist at the @entity5 explained in a blog post			1
now , multispectral imaging of the burnt copy – a non-destructive imaging technique - has been conducted and has revealed text that has not been visible for 250 years			1
a @entity5 curator told @entity57 that some of the words of the @entity2 's ' security clause ' can be seen using the @entity62 image			1
once the charters were removed from the frames , near - infrared spectroscopy and high - resolution digital microscopy was used to investigate the condition of the ink and parchment			0
multispectral imaging was used to ' virtually peel away the layers of damage ' and reveal obscured words using a high resolution camera and different wavelengths of light			1
the variations in the chemical composition of the material in the charter was varied and included ink and parchment which reacts differently to the lights			2
this means that experts could see extra information – including text – which is undetectable by the human eye			1
an @entity30 translation reads : ' since we have granted all these things for @entity91 , for the better ordering of our kingdom , and to allay the discord that has arisen between us and our barons , and since we desire that they shall be enjoyed in their entirety , with lasting strength , for ever , we give and grant to the barons the following security : the barons shall elect twenty - five of their number to keep , and cause to be observed with all their might , the peace and liberties granted and confirmed to them by this charter			0
' if we , our chief justice , our officials or any of our servants offend in any respect against any man , or transgress any of the articles of the peace or of this security , and the offence is made known to four of the twenty - five barons , they shall come to us ... to declare it and claim immediate redress ... the twenty - five barons shall swear to obey all the above articles faithfully , and shall cause them to be obeyed by others to the best of their power			0
' the clause is so important because it was the only means by which @entity2 was to be enforced			1
if @entity129 was judged to have transgressed its terms , an elected committee of twenty - five barons were given authority to seek redress from him			0

' the ‘ burnt ’ @entity2 ( pictrured ) was damaged in the @entity40 fore in 1731 and staff at the library attempted to preserve it using 19th century techniques , by flattening it out and mounting it , which left some text almost impossible to see multispectral imaging ( pictured left ) – a non-destructive imaging technique - of the burnt copy has been conducted and has revealed text that has not been visible for 250 years			1
an image of the historical manuscript can be seen , right , under cyan lighting conditions the scanned copy of the @entity2 was damaged in the @entity40 fire in 1731			1
the contents of the @entity40 was assembled by @entity188 and presented to the @entity190 nation by his grandson in 1700			0
it contains some of the most well - known treasures of the @entity5 , including the @entity194 , @entity2 and @entity195			2
on october 23 , 1731 , a fire broke out where the manuscripts were being temporarily held , at @entity199 , @entity200			2
a quarter of the collection was affected and the librarian is said to have leapt from a window to escape the blaze , rescuing an early manuscript of the @entity207 at the same time			2
a total of 13 manuscripts were completely destroyed and many only survived as charred fragments , or with significant damage			0
lots of the parchments were coated in gelatine , which is the end product of sudden degradation of the parchment collagen			0
when cooled , it becomes brittle and obscures text			0
@entity221 used to extinguish the fire , also played a role in damaging the literary treasures			0
the content of the hidden text is n't new , because the four manuscripts have the same content , but the discovery is important nonetheless			0
to clarify the contents of the damaged parchment , a team of experts first examined the original frames to determine their structure and composition			2
all original mounting materials in contact with the charters were tested using different methods , such as infrared spectroscopy and ph tests , to determine their stability and compatibility with the new materials			0
once the charters were removed from the frames , near - infrared spectroscopy and high - resolution digital microscopy was used to investigate the condition of the ink and parchment to assess the overall condition of the historical document			0
‘ with the frames and glass removed , there was a rare opportunity to employ the cutting - edge technique of multispectral imaging enabling us to virtually peel away the layers of damage currently affecting the manuscript , ’ dr @entity41 wrote			1
multispectral imaging is a non-destructive , non-invasive imaging technique using different colour lights , including ultra-violet and infrared , to recover faded and lost text			1

this is the result when used on the manuscript			0
text invisible to the human eye can be seen and analysed by experts in february 2015 , the four copies of the @entity2 will be brought together for the first time in history for a three - day event , which will allow further academic study of them side by side			1
an easily legible copy usually housed at @entity285 is shown uncovering the text was a painstaking process			0
temporary housing was prepared to store the charter ( top left ) and the original wooden frames carefully removed to get access to the manuscript ( top right )			2
the charter was removed from the mounting ( bottom left ) and then underwent tests to determine its condition ( bottom right ) a high - resolution camera was securely mounted directly over the charter , which was then illuminated with led lights ranging from the ultraviolet at wavelengths invisible to humans , to the visible			2
the chemical composition of the material in the charter was varied and included ink and parchment which reacts differently to the lights			0
this means that experts could see extra information – including text – which is undetectable by the human eye			2
this technique will allow scientists to preserve the @entity2 for the next 800 years			1
in february 2015 , the four manuscripts will be brought together for the first time in history for a three - day event , which will allow further academic study of them side by side			0
the date is 800 years after the issue of the charter by @entity129 in 1215			1
a total of 1,215 members of the public will also be able to see them			0
people interested in the historic opportunity can enter a ballot to be in with a chance of taking part in the event , sponsored by law firm @entity338			0
the @entity5 is home to two of the original @entity2 manuscripts , while the other two are held at @entity343 and @entity344			2
@entity345 , @entity346 of @entity347 and earlier manuscripts at the @entity5 , says : ' @entity2 is the most popular item in the @entity350 , and is venerated around the world as marking the starting point for government under the law			2
' bringing the four surviving manuscripts together for the first time will create a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for researchers and members of the public to see them in one place			0
' the @entity5 ( pictuerd ) is home to two of the original @entity2 manuscripts , while the other two are held at @entity343 and @entity364			2

burnt @entity2 text has been made visible for the first time in 250 years
experts used multispectral imaging work to reveal the *illegible* words
manuscript was said to have been damaged in a fire in @entity6 in 1731
it 's one of four that have survived since 1215 when the charter was created
the four documents will come together for the first time next year
