the owner of @entity1 today launched a £ 1billion takeover bid for @entity3 in an attempt to secure valuable take - off and landing slots at @entity7			1
@entity8 , which currently owns @entity1 and @entity9 , has offered a deal worth € 2.55 a share , or € 1.36billion in total , to buy @entity14 's national airline			1
the company is keen to secure more space at the @entity18 's biggest airport , which is almost full to capacity - meaning that landing slots are now worth millions of pounds			2
but the deal could be scuppered by the @entity14 government , which may block the move for political reasons , or by @entity25 , whose combative boss @entity26 has long been trying to buy @entity3			1
bid : @entity1 owner @entity8 has offered to buy @entity3 for a price of around £ 1billion full : the company is keen to expand at @entity7 , pictured , even though the airport is near capacity already the @entity35 - based airline confirmed this morning that its board was considering a new offer from @entity8 , having previously rejected two lower bids out of hand			1
@entity8 warned that this offer could be the last throw of the dice for the proposed deal , saying : ' there can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming			0
' the company 's chief executive , @entity47 , was previously in charge at @entity3 before moving across the @entity50 and joining @entity1			0
as well as the potential for efficiency savings by bringing @entity3 into a larger group , @entity8 is keen to expand its grip on @entity7 , where it is already by far the largest operator			1
@entity1 controls more than half the landing slots at the airport , according to the latest available figures , and if it were combined with @entity3 and @entity9 , @entity8 would have 56 per cent of all flights coming into and going out of @entity7			1
showdown : @entity8 , whose chief executive is @entity47 , left , could see its bid scuppered by controversial @entity25 boss @entity26 , right if the three airlines joined forces , they would account for 51.6 per cent of passengers passing through the airport			2
because @entity7 is running at almost full capacity , the only ways for an airline to expand its offerings at the airport are to trade in landing slots - worth several millions of pounds each - or to buy up a rival			1
@entity3 is currently the fourth busiest operator at the airport , behind @entity1 , @entity76 and @entity77 , running up to 22 flights a day between @entity7 and @entity35			2
@entity7 could expand if a third runway is built , but the issue is politically controversial and no decision will be made on the matter until after the general election in may			0
analysts suggested today that the @entity8 bid was likely to be accepted - but the @entity14 government could still step in to veto any deal			2
grip : @entity1 is already the largest airline at @entity7 , controlling more than half of landing slots @entity3 is 25 per cent state - owned , despite the @entity14 government 's promise to privatise it fully as part of the @entity95 bailout deal struck in 2010			1
politicians are keen to safeguard the airline 's 3,900 workers , most based in @entity35 , as well as ensuring that there is no decrease in the number of flights between @entity14 and @entity103			0
deputy prime minister @entity104 said yesterday : ' what we will want to do as a government , and what 's absolutely important , is to protect these slots and the connections of direct flights in and out of @entity14			0
' the country 's opposition has called on the government to rule out any sale , while trade union impact warned that a takeover would pose ' significant risk ' to the @entity14 economy as a whole			0
another potential hurdle is @entity25 , @entity14 's budget short - haul carrier , which owns a 30 per cent stake in @entity3 following a series of unsuccessful attempts to buy the airline outright			0
chief executive @entity26 , known for his outspoken manner and aggressive attitude towards his customers , said last week he was open to considering a bid for @entity25 's stake			0
@entity3 shares rose by 3.8 per cent this morning , peaking at € 2.44 , while shares in @entity8 were up by 3.5 per cent .			0

@entity8 has offered € 2.55 a share for @entity3 , valuing the firm at £ 1billion
