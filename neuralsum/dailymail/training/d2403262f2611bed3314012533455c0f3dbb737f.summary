by @entity0 it is no mystery that men are given a boost by the effects a push - up bra has on the cleavage			1
but what is more surprising is the effect a boosted cleavage can have on the woman herself			0
for the first time , scientists have measured the effect an enhanced cleavage has on confidence - and found there is a direct link			2
the unique study , led by scientists at @entity21 proves for the first time the clear connection between a cleavage - enhancing bra and increased confidence - prompting the study lead , professor @entity26 , to call for a stop to ' unnecessary boob jobs ' boost : scientists at @entity21 found that women wearing the push - up bra demonstrated confidence levels 75 per cent higher than normal a total of 60 video recordings were made of female participants aged 20 to 55 , filmed in three different everyday interactions			1
footage was compared of them wearing a push - up bra and wearing their own normal , everyday bra			1
professor @entity26 and his team analysed the three key micro-behaviours associated with confidence and observed their frequency within the recordings			2
smiling - which represents positive emotion and signals confidence increased dramatically by 73 per cent when the women were wearing a push up bra			1
averting gaze and breaking eye contact - normally associated with low confidence - decreased by 41 per cent			2
and self - comforting hand movements such as stroking of the chin or wiping the forehand , which is a signpost to low self confidence , decreased by 64 per cent during the trial			2
professor of psychology at the @entity21 @entity26 called the results ' striking '			1
the scientists found women with an enhanced cleavage were more likely to maintain eye contact and showed fewer physical signs of low confidence ' the differences are much more pronounced than expected , ' he said			0
' the study showed emphatically that wearing the cleavage - enhancing bra had a significant effect on nonverbal behaviours that are crucially associated with levels of self - confidence			1
' and we know that confidence impacts on performance , both at work and in our personal lives			0
' society places a huge amount of pressure to look a certain way and this impacts on women ’s perceptions of their own body image , ultimately affecting their confidence			0
' for this study , i was n’t interested in what women reported about how they felt wearing the different bras – this study was about the actual behaviours they displayed , subconscious indicators that can be much more revealing			0
' my hope is that this research might deter women from seeking more drastic solutions to improve their confidence , such as breast augmentation , because it proves for the first time that what women wear can positively affect their behaviour			0
' this is the first academic study to demonstrate a clear link between confidence and cleavage			0
the research was independently commissioned by @entity116 for its launch of the @entity119 push - up bra , which has been two years in development and was used in the trial			1
@entity122 who is responsible for the design of the @entity119 bra explains : ' we hope this research will prevent more women from having unnecessary plastic surgery to enhance their breasts , especially in light of the recent @entity132 implant scares			0
' it just shows that you do n’t have to go under the knife to achieve confidence - boosting killer cleavage			0
' ' @entity116 has been making lingerie for 110 years and we recognise that stunning cleavage in a well designed , well - made bra can boost confidence and give our customers the feelgood factor - but it ’s amazing to actually have the scientific seal of approval			1

@entity21 study proves push - up bra alone significantly boosts confidence
