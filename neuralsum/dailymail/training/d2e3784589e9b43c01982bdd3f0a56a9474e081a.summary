by @entity0 published : 20:17 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 7 march 2013 the ‘ blight ’ of giant windfarms spreading across @entity4 is the ‘ most widespread and persistent threat ’ to our countryside , the @entity1 has warned			1
chairman sir @entity8 yesterday singled out the proliferation of wind turbines as he highlighted concerns about the government ’s planning reforms , which he said would cause ‘ warfare ’ in local communities if not delayed			1
his comment come just weeks after its new director - general , dame @entity17 , described wind turbines as ‘ beautiful ’ , but agreed that land near historic buildings or sensitive landscapes was not the right place for the giant windmills			2
blight on the landscape : @entity1 claims @entity26 , such as this one in @entity27 , @entity28 , are today the most ' widespread and persistent threat ' to the @entity4 countryside speaking yesterday sir @entity8 spoke of how the trust was fighting wind farm applications on an increasingly frequent basis			1
he said : ‘ there ’s clearly a major battle taking place almost everywhere on wind farms			0
wind turbines are very intrusive forms of renewable energy			0
‘ @entity1 policy is perfectly clear			1
we ’re not against renewable energy or wind turbines in the right place , we do oppose wind turbines that blight the landscape			0
‘ we ’re sceptical over wind in the wrong place			0
at the moment there are threats of wind turbines the breadth of the country , ’ he said			1
‘ in almost every region of @entity4 there are proposals on wind farms which local people are fighting brilliantly			1
@entity1 has to be conversant with this battle			2
’ @entity1 chairman sir @entity8 raised the issue as he highlighted concerns over the government 's planning reforms asked if the @entity1 would consider buying areas of outstanding beauty to prevent them from the giant windmills , sir @entity8 said it would not be possible due to the scale of applications			1
‘ we are always in the market for property			0
but to be honest , the threat is so widespread , you ca n’t even think about it			0
if you started buying land in @entity82 and @entity83 to protect it , you would buy the whole of @entity82 and @entity83 , ’ he said			0
but the @entity1 would consider buying easements – a right over the land - to prevent the building of wind farms in sensitive landscapes			1
sir @entity8 warned that planning reforms intended to stimulate the economy ‘ will produce not more housing , but more conflict ’			1
the charity is calling for a delay in the introduction of the rules set to come into force later this month , in order to prevent local communities becoming entrenched in costly battles with building and wind farm developers			1
it said councils need more time to adopt local plans which specify where building can take place , to prevent the ‘ risk of unwanted speculative development ’			0
so far , only half of local authorities have created plans for their area , according to research carried out by the @entity1			2
campaigners fear those without their own guidelines will be forced to follow national rules that favour indiscriminate construction			0
following what was a ‘ difficult year ’ for the trust , sir @entity8 warned of an unprecedented number of threats to @entity4 ’s countryside , including the spread of wind farms , as well as the proposed route of the @entity131 high - speed rail line and the prospect of shale gas exploration			1
asked about the growing number of planning disputes , he said : ‘ i ca n’t remember anything like it ...			2
we can spend our entire time in court			0
this i because @entity4 is not being planned			2
if you do not have plans , you have battles			0
’ a year ago , councils were given until the end of this month to adopt local plans spelling out where development can take place in their area , or be subject to national guidelines which state a ‘ presumption in favour of sustainable development ’			0
but just over half will miss the deadline , making it much easier for developers to build on unprotected parts of the countryside , sir @entity8 warned			1
he said the @entity1 was ‘ not against development - we ’re against inappropriate development ’ , and said local plans would ensure building happened in the right places			2
the charity is ‘ pleading ’ with the government to extend the deadline for another year , otherwise ‘ it will just mean everyone will spend their time fighting , fighting , fighting - and that will not be the best way to plan @entity4			1
’ the government ’s current approach to planning would produce less development , sir @entity8 said			1
‘ these are difficult times and the government is desperate to find means of growth , and thinks somehow allowing development to rip will give them growth			0
we disagree , ’ he said			0
‘ it will produce not more housing , but more conflict			0
you start trying to build houses where people do n’t want them , anyone who knows anything about local @entity4 knows it will be a warfare area			2

chairman of the @entity1 , sir @entity8 , made the claim as he raised concerns over @entity178 's planning reforms
he said the @entity1 is fighting wind farm applications on a frequent basis
sir @entity8 added @entity4 countryside faces unprecedented number of threats
