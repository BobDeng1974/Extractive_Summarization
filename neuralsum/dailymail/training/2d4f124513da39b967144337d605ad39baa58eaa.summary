@entity1 boss @entity0 has often said that his former manager @entity2 is always at the other end of a telephone if he ever wants a catch - up or chat about the pitfalls of management			1
but rookie manager @entity0 admits there has been no time to talk this week ahead of @entity11 's visit to the @entity12 in the third round of the @entity14 on tuesday night			1
@entity11 's busy schedule of domestic and @entity17 commitments , @entity0 says , has put paid to the usual conversations between two men who shared the same remarkable journey as @entity1 rose through the divisions of @entity24 football			1
@entity0 often looks to @entity2 for advice , but the @entity26 has been too busy of late ' i 've not had any contact with @entity2 this week as he has been very busy with lots of games , ' @entity0 said ahead of their third reunion since the 35 - year - old took over at @entity1 last february			1
' it 's always great to see him			0
i know him very well and i know he will want to win the game like i will want to win the game			0
' it will be a good cup tie - it will be an interesting one			0
' we are at home , i am sure the fans will be right up for it and hopefully we can get the right result			0
' @entity1 suffered a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity45 on saturday after record signing @entity46 was sent off @entity11 also lost at the weekend , going down 3 - 2 against @entity48 at @entity49 on sunday the two men were team - mates when @entity0 joined @entity1 in 2004 and three years later the centre - back was @entity2 's captain when the @entity26 took his first steps in management in south @entity55			1
@entity2 later moved on to @entity56 and then @entity11 , where he has enjoyed notable success by taking the @entity59 club back into @entity60 following last season 's fifth - placed finish in the @entity63			2
he also managed two @entity49 victories over @entity65 last season while his friend was in caretaker control at @entity1 , 3 - 1 in a fifth - round @entity70 tie in february and 3 - 2 in a @entity63 game the following month			1
@entity0 would love to redress the balance on tuesday and admits he would also enjoy another cup run after @entity1 won the @entity14 two seasons ago			2
@entity0 played for @entity1 between 2004 and 2014 , and was a team - mate of @entity2 's until he left in 2006 @entity2 and @entity65 will go head - to - head on tuesday when @entity1 host @entity11 at the @entity12 ' the cup always ranks high and it would be nice to go on a run , ' @entity0 said			1
' we also want to bounce back because we lost to @entity45 on saturday and it would be nice to try to make sure we do n't lose the next one			0
' @entity1 have actually never beaten @entity11 in their history , a total of 20 games which have brought 15 wins for the @entity11 and five draws			2
' we know how @entity2 sets up and he knows how we set up , ' said @entity1 defender @entity84			0
' we have played against them a lot of times now and they will always be good games , but hopefully we can come out on top this time because their record here is something we need to put right			0
' @entity11 are a good footballing side but we won the @entity14 a couple of years ago and know how good it can be			0

@entity0 played under @entity2 when the @entity26 managed @entity1 between 2007 and 2009
they were also team - mates at the @entity55 club between 2004 and 2006
