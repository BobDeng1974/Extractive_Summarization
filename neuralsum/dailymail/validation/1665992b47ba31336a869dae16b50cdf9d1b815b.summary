officers had claimed @entity0 who was nicknamed ' braveheart ' when he captain of @entity1 was almost twice the limit after failing a breathaylser test			1
former @entity1 captain @entity0 , pictured arriving at @entity18 , has admitted drink driving @entity0 goes in for a challenge on @entity21 at the @entity22 in 1998 while @entity23 looks on but on wednesday , widowed father of four @entity0 disputed the reading and asked @entity18 to have the case adjourned so his metabolism could be tested			1
the court heard that @entity0 admitted drinking before driving his blue @entity30 , but argued the amount of alcohol he drank over a certain period of time should not have put him over the limit			1
his lawyer @entity36 - who has previously represented a string of celebrities over his expertise in exploiting motoring legal loopholes - said : ' usually we go to sentence and it is inevitable he would have to be disqualified because he has entered a guilty plea because he accepts the facts			0
' but the instructions i have over the amount of alcohol consumed and the time period , when you do the calculations they do n't correlate with the figure he has given			0
' there are two possibilities - one is because of the fact that he has got some alcohol in his system he is unaware of and the other is quite rare is we have somebody whose metabolism is such they provide a specimen of breath which does not correlate with the reading of blood			2
' we have had a forensic scientist give us an indication that the figures provided by the defendant do n't correlate with the figures given by the sample			0
he was stopped by police and arrested near his home in @entity11 , @entity12 in the early hours of february 21 , and was found to be driving his blue @entity30 while almost double the legal alcohol limit ( stock picture ) @entity0 , pictured hear tackling @entity77 in 1997 , made more than 300 appearances for @entity8 ' we accept the prosecution 's case - the police followed him , he was n't driving erratically , nothing unusual about that , he accepts that - the question is why is this alcohol reading being given that is being investigated			1
' we can establish what he consumed and when it was because there are receipts			0
' mr @entity0 might have to be tested for his metabolism in the lab with a reconstruction of the whole evening 's events			2
the ratio between breath and blood is not the same for everyone			0
' if our investigations do n't have foundation in science we would bring it back to court and have it dealt with			0
mr @entity0 wants the matter to be dealt with as quickly as possible			2
' the court agreed to adjourn for a ' special reasons ' hearing in which @entity0 will call evidence from a forensic service scientist and two civilian witnesses who were with him on the night of the incident			2
@entity0 - who arrived for the hearing in sunglasses and a grey suit - had 63 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 milliltres of breath - the legal limit is 35mg			1
initial forensic tests conducted on behalf of @entity0 had shown the figures did not correlate and further investigation was needed , said mr @entity36			2
the 49 - year old former @entity7 defender has blamed his ' quite rare ' metabolism for being over the limit @entity0 playing for @entity7 against @entity126 side @entity125 in october 1998 the solicitor added that the later sentencing bench could have the option not to disqualify @entity0 from driving but the conviction would stand regardless			1
@entity0 , was granted unconditional bail until april 22 when the case will be heard in full before sentencing			0
