by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 10 august 2013 the other day , my two grandchildren , @entity3 and @entity4 , played in the garden all day			1
it was very hot , so the paddling pool was filled and they were soon joined by the children who live next door			1
soon @entity4 , still a gloriously uninhibited three - year - old , was running about in his birthday suit , as his sister , with all the sophistication of a five - year - old , pretended to be appalled and felt it her duty to tell on him			2
the following day was just as warm – but the children were taken to the cinema and , in the afternoon , watched tv , when normally they would be told to go outside and get some fresh air , instead of sitting in front of the box			1
troubling : parents with young children face difficult questions when they find out that a neighbour is a paedophile this picture is posed by models the reason was simple – adult fear			1
much to their bewilderment we just did n’t want to let them out of our sight , did n’t want them to go beyond their own driveway – and even then they had to be fully clothed			2
you see , that morning we found out that a very near neighbour had appeared in court , where he admitted making and distributing indecent images and videos of children			1
he had also engaged in sexual activity with underage girls and sent indecent communications to other children over the internet			1
at the age of 26 , this man that we waved to and greeted cheerily as we passed , has been placed on the @entity55 ’s @entity54 and awaits sentencing after the usual reports			2
cliches were all we could think of at first			2
that we were shocked , that we could n’t believe it was true , that it could n’t happen in a place like this – all the usual responses of the bewildered parent			0
everyone knows paedophiles exist across society but for some reason you do n’t expect to meet one on your own doorstep			0
then instinct kicked in , in the form of an almost overwhelming urge to be sick – followed by another to wrap the children in three layers of clothing from head to foot and to only pass this man ’s house with a very wide body swerve			1
close to home : paedophiles exist across society but people do not expect to meet one on their own doorstep			1
this picture is posed by models @entity3 and @entity4 live in a small street of about eight large upmarket houses , a quiet place with no through traffic so they are safe to run around – the kind of place where everyone really does know everyone else			0
they scamper in and out of each other ’s gardens as well as their own and all the children are welcome to play together in any of them without any qualms			1
directly in front is the sea , a great attraction not just for them but for the holidaymakers who flock to the beach every summer			1
to the left is a very good play park and , down in the bay , a mixed bird population where the children visit to throw bread and count the new chicks			1
there is , then , a good population of children at the best of times and even more so in the hot weather – and from this man ’s home he has clear views of our gardens , plus all the attractions that bring people here			1
he has the capacity and twisted interest to take pictures and videos of innocent children too , and one of the stomach - churning questions on every mind today is whether he has already filmed our own youngsters			1
at the moment , it is possible for women to check with the police in case a new partner is a paedophile , but not for parents in the community to know if one – or more – is living nearby , or even next door			1
to allow parents this knowledge could lead to possible vigilante action – so says the official @entity154 is enough that the police know , though everyone is aware that they can not monitor these people round the clock			0
and it is true that in the past , when communities have found out for themselves , they have forced paedophiles out of their areas			1
mob rule , say the authorities , but you have to wonder why the safety of vulnerable children comes second to those who have committed offences against children			2
there has to be a better system that puts protection of children before that of convicted paedophiles – but if there is one , there is clearly a reluctance to put it in place			2
but this man has been caught and convicted and we do know where he lives , a right most parents believe they should have , and one i have always supported			0
until today , i thought it was enough to be forearmed with that knowledge			0
but when i look out of my window i can see directly into this man ’s home			1
he is that close , and with a sickening suddenness i realised it is not enough just to know			0
in fact , all it does is throw up yet more questions and more anxieties			0
for the first time i now appreciate fully the way these offences spread out , the ripples gathering everyone in			0
for instance , what do we tell very young children like @entity3 and @entity4 ? concerns : parents would not want to let children out of their sight if they found out a paedophile was a neighbour			1
this is a file picture of children playing outside we will want them to stay away from his house , that is obvious			2
but how do we explain this to them when they have always had the freedom to roam about what was once a safe area ? @entity3 , at only five , would have no understanding of the issues involved and for the life of me i can think of no simple way of telling her			0
if we simply warn her to keep away from that house because a bad man lives there , we will plant not just fear , but possibly terror in her young mind that @entity4 would soon pick up on too			0
this is how childhood innocence is destroyed			0
clearly we can not let them be as free as they were just the other day			0
yet we know that withdrawing their usual freedom will unfairly restrict them and they are completely innocent – they have committed no crime			0
the house that i can see from my window is this man ’s family home , where he lives with his elderly parents , and to where he will eventually return			1
even if he does soon get a custodial sentence , i would bet anything it will be short			0
his parents have committed no crime either and can not be compelled to leave their home , something that could be considered if they lived in council housing			2
and how are we to treat them now that we are aware of their son ’s sick interests ? @entity263 alone knows what hell they must already be going through but , however much sympathy it is possible to have for their situation , expressing this and befriending them is out of the question – keeping our distance is our only realistic option			0
and if any one of us decides to sell our home , do we tell prospective buyers of this man ’s existence and crimes ? i would n’t consider living in a house near him – and if i unsuspectingly bought one then found out how close he was , i would pull out of the sale , regardless of the legal situation			1
so here we all sit , paralysed in a way , stunned by what we have just found out , the anger only now beginning to surface			2
it is not an exaggeration to say entire lives , existences and outlooks have been changed by the crimes of someone in our midst , whose perversion we never had any reason to suspect for even one minute			0
you do n’t , do you ? for this kind of thing always happens on someone else ’s doorstep , a horror story far away that we tut - tut over in the newspapers			0
but we are now asking questions for which i suspect no answers exist : what do we do , what happens now ? we are constantly told by those who profess to know that modern parents are over-protective of their children , that our entirely unjustified anxieties stifle them and deny them the kind of freedoms every child should have			2
there has been yet another report saying exactly that this week			0
not an argument that would be entertained in our quiet little backwater today i have to say – and , possibly , not one that ever will be again .			0
