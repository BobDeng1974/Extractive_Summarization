it was a question that plagued spooks for three decades - was @entity3 's great aunt a @entity5 agent ? countess @entity7 's life reads like it was right off the pages of an espionage thriller , with walk - on parts from @entity11 , @entity12 and notorious @entity15 spy ring traitors @entity13 and @entity16			1
but it was the @entity19 emigre 's relationship with famous agent @entity20 that first aroused the suspicions of @entity24 intelligence			1
intelligence officials speculated for three decades about whether @entity3 's great aunt , countess @entity7 , pictured above , was a soviet spy it had been well known that @entity20 had fallen for a woman named @entity7 when he was in @entity19 after the @entity29 - and that woman turned out to be @entity31			1
the pair had met in 1918 , when @entity20 was head of the @entity33 in @entity19 , and @entity34 was married to another man			0
their romance was later dramatised in the 1934 film @entity39			0
the countess was later cleared of being a spy and left @entity42			1
while living between @entity44 and @entity45 she applied to enter @entity24 to be with her niece , @entity46 , @entity43 reported			1
@entity24 authorities were not concerned about @entity48 , but in the 1950s one spy sent a memo to another , expressing doubts about ' @entity53 ' , who appeared to be closely linked to @entity31			1
countess @entity46 had changed her surname after marrying , @entity56			2
the couple were the grandparents of @entity3 , who has previously described his great aunt as an ' utterly terrifying ' woman			0
the newspaper searched the @entity62 and reports that @entity31 's name appeared in hundreds of documents , gathered by @entity24 intelligence officers over a 30 year period			1
whether the @entity46 was in fact a @entity5 spy was a question the @entity71 never answered			2
despite having contacts across @entity74 , including inside @entity11 's regime , they suspected she was probably the target of hostile gossip			2
the @entity78 , however , concluded she was a spy			2
the @entity24 secret service 's various informants were inconsistent in their observations about @entity31			1
her looks , intelligence and morality were debated			2
she was called an ' absolute devil ' , but it was also suggested that she could simply be the victim of spitefulness			1
despite having had several male lovers , at least one source thought she was a lesbian			2
@entity20 and @entity31 were arrested in the panic that followed an attempt on @entity93 's life in 1918			0
the @entity46 is thought to have later secured her freedom by seducing her investigating officer			1
@entity3 , pictured as a boy with his father @entity3 , described his great aunt as ' utterly terrifying ' whether the @entity46 was in fact a @entity5 spy was a question the @entity71 never answered			2
despite having contacts across @entity74 , including inside @entity11 's regime , they suspected she was probably the target of hostile gossip			2
the @entity78 , however , concluded she was a spy she then returned to @entity19 where she began working for writer @entity106 , before becoming his lover			0
a year later , in 1921 , @entity106 secured permission for her to move to @entity42 , after she had spent the night with @entity12 , who was staying with them			1
when she moved , documents noted that she the @entity111 had married another man , who she lived with for a year before they divorced			0
it was thought it was a marriage of convenience to secure the countess @entity42 citizenship			1
the @entity46 later reunited with @entity106 and they lived together in @entity119 for several years before the author returned to @entity19			0
the newspaper speculated that her move to @entity24 was perhaps motivated more by her fear of being without a lover , than to be with her niece			1
the @entity46 soon became well connected in the @entity24 and @entity24 authorities continued to keep her under surveillance			1
but because high profile people like wartime solicitor general @entity129 and the minister of information , lord @entity131 , vouched for her good character , the @entity46 simply remained a mystery			0
she had worked for lord @entity131 during the war			0
@entity3 's aunt , @entity31 , became a @entity24 citizen in 1947 ; her first vote was for @entity139 countess @entity34 remained in contact with @entity106 whose house remained under surveillance by @entity11 's police			1
she travelled in and out of @entity19 on four occasions , the last of which was in 1936 when @entity106 lay dying			0
she never required a visa and it is thought that is because @entity19 police may have wanted something from her			0
the trips ignited the suspicions of @entity153 , secretary of the @entity78 embassy , who went on to warn his @entity24 counterparts about her			1
it was also thought the @entity46 was being paid by the @entity44 , but this was later dismissed			0
in april 1942 , @entity159 's personal aide , sir @entity158 , wrote to the secret service about the @entity162 warning that she was a ' perfect terror at intrigue '			0
the service acknowledged they knew a great deal about her , but said they considered her to be anti-nazi			0
countess @entity7 became a @entity24 citizen in 1947			1
her first vote was for @entity139			0
she came under suspicion again in 1951 when the @entity71 were told that @entity173 's family had known for years that she was a spy			0
and when the @entity24 intelligence service was hit by one of the biggest spy scandals in history , in may 1951 , her name came up again			1
two agents , @entity13 and @entity180 , disappeared after the @entity181 learned that @entity182 was a spy			0
@entity13 had dined with the @entity46 on a number of occasions			0
but the @entity24 secret service never decided what to make of @entity187 who died in november 1974			2
