you probably have to go back to that unforgettable back nine meltdown at the masters in 2011 to find the last time @entity4 had a 30 minute collapse to rival the one he suffered at the @entity6 on saturday			1
one minute he was making birdies for fun to be tied for the lead with defending champion @entity11			1
this brilliant @entity13 season looked for all the world like it would get the sunday showdown between the pair it deserved			0
then came that half - hour of madness , as almost unbelievably the world number one followed one double bogey with another			2
in 30 minutes he had gone from co-leader to outside the top ten			1
seeing him get one double bogey – his first in 220 holes at the @entity26 – was shocking enough but two in a row was positively jaw - dropping			2
@entity44 to bounce back from those four dropped shots at the 12th and 13th with a birdie at the 14th and another at the 18th			2
but those costly lapses have left him with an awful lot to do if he is to end this amazing campaign with one more victory			0
the 25 - year - old had to settle for a 70 and , on another day of low scoring , that ’s left him four shots adrift of the co-leaders , @entity11 and @entity57			1
@entity4 made up seven strokes to win the @entity59 at @entity60 in may and spark his remarkable summer			1
but it will be some feat to make up such a sizable deficit against an opponent as formidable as the @entity65 on a course that suits him to a tee			0
@entity11 plays his second shot of the ninth hole from the bunker on day three @entity11 recovered from his troubles in the bunker to lead the course at the end of the third round ‘ i ’m obviously a bit frustrated at the minute about those double bogeys but at least the late birdies mean i ’m not out of it , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ the idea on sunday will be to play aggressively and go at the pins and try to post a low score			0
’ as for @entity11 , he said : ‘ at the end of the year we always look at trophies and it would mean an awful lot to me to defend this title for my first win this season			1
’ the one thing that will give @entity4 encouragement is there are only three players ahead of him			2
@entity11 and @entity57 are three shots ahead of @entity95 on eleven under – and then comes @entity4 on ten under , alongside three other players in @entity98 @entity97 , @entity99 and rising @entity101 rookie @entity100			1
@entity11 hits a shot on the 18th hole against the glorious backdrop of the @entity32 course @entity101 ’s @entity100 reacts following a missed putt on the 18th green @entity11 will start as clear favourite given he ’s ranked number four in the world and loves this @entity110 course			2
but @entity113 @entity57 deserves high credit for a stunning comeback from an opening round of 73 that appeared to rule out any chance of winning			1
how he has responded , following a 64 on friday with a 65 on saturday			0
similarly , @entity118 has bounced back from being four over par after 10 holes on thursday to give himself an opportunity to clinch his third victory of the year			0
@entity97 was third in this event last season and again showed his liking for the course with a 67			0
@entity129 ’s @entity128 plays a shot on the 17th hole and how about @entity100 ? the 23 year old @entity101 appears to have been pipped for the sir @entity134 prize by exciting @entity136 @entity135 , who won the @entity137 last week			0
but that could all change if he can piece together the best round of his career on sunday			0
‘ i think i would have to win the event to win the rookie race as well but who knows what might happen if i can hole a few putts on the back nine , ’ said @entity100			0
‘ it ’s still a bit weird for me seeing my name next to the likes of @entity4 and @entity11 , so i ’ll have to make sure i keep my emotions in check			1
’ scot @entity153 and @entity154 from @entity101 will start the final round five in arrears after rounds of 65 and 71 respectively .			0

@entity4 is four shots behind leaders @entity11 and @entity57 after third round of @entity161
@entity4 went from co-leader to outside the top ten in just 30 minutes of play
two double bogeys prove costly for @entity168
