by @entity0 published : 19:38 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 30 october 2013 @entity1 was accused of playing ‘ political games ’ over @entity3 by @entity4 yesterday			1
his intervention stepped up pressure on the @entity7 as his party appeared to change its stance to back the £ 50billion rail project			1
the deputy prime minister added that he would not compromise on @entity3 in any future talks with @entity7 about forming a government			1
under fire : @entity4 accused @entity7 leader @entity1 of ' playing political games ' with the @entity3 project mr @entity4 said the idea was inherited from @entity7 and it was ‘ pathetic ... that when it becomes politically convenient to play games with it , they start playing games with it ’			1
senior sources in the party said @entity7 would throw its support behind it as long as the incoming chairman , former @entity27 supremo sir @entity26 , is given a free rein to bring down the costs - particularly the £ 14billion earmarked as a contingency fund			2
both @entity31 and the new transport spokeswoman @entity32 have been notably lukewarm about the project , claiming they still support the principle but not ‘ at any cost ’ and attacked the government for ‘ mismanagement ’ after the budget rose by £ 10bn			2
ministers say the link is vital to @entity43 ’s future prosperity as @entity3 will allow trains to travel at 225mph , reducing journey times but also providing much - needed capacity on the overcrowded route			0
yesterday @entity48 , who has suggested the rail link from @entity50 to @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , will not go ahead without public support , accused mr @entity1 of ‘ flip flopping ’			1
non negotiable : deputy prime minister @entity4 said he would not compromise on the £ 50billion rail project in any future talks with @entity7 about forming a government at prime minister ’s questions , he accused @entity7 of putting the project at risk			1
he said : ‘ let us just examine what has happened with @entity3 this week			0
the shadow chancellor touring the radio studios telling everyone it wo n’t go ahead			0
‘ labour local authority leaders begging the leader of the opposition to stand up this infrastructure scheme			0
and what has he done ? cowered in his office too weak to make a decision			0
‘ we all know it needs cross party agreement to make this important infrastructure scheme go ahead and what a pathetic spectacle we ’ve seen this week - one minute they ’re for it then they ’re against it and the leader of the opposition too weak to make a decision			0
’ as the row escalated @entity31 , the shadow chancellor , was heard to shout across the chamber : ‘ i ’m just doing what the chancellor should be doing			0
’ no ' flip - flopping ' : @entity48 accused @entity7 of putting @entity3 at risk @entity4 then upped the pressure by indicating that support for the rail link would be a red line in any coalition discussions with @entity7 at the next election , if the final decision falls after 2015			1
last night a @entity7 sources said they would vote with the government today on a law which allocates the funds for the project , but does not give the green light to construction the project , on which around £ 1billion has already been spent , faces many more parliamentary hurdles before work can begin as planned in 2017			1
but a party insider said : ‘ we support @entity3 , we will support the bill tomorrow , but its right that we do n’t give the government a blank cheque			0
’ asked if he would ever compromise on @entity3 in a future government , mr @entity4 said ‘ no ’ , accused @entity7 of playing ‘ political games ’ , and said business leaders in his @entity117 constituency were ‘ absolutely appalled at the way in which @entity7 appears to be betraying the north			1
’ he said : ‘ it just beggars belief for a party that constantly parades itself as the authentic voice of the north of @entity124 is now prepared to turn its back on the businesses , the communities , the families which i think all the evidence shows will benefit disproportionately from an investment in a high speed north - south railway link			0
‘ i just think it is miserable , it ’s pathetic that an idea which we inherited from @entity7 and in all good faith took forward because we thought , given they were the architects of the idea they might support it , that when it becomes politically convenient to play games with it , they start playing games with it			1
’ mr @entity4 ’s spokesman later tried to play down his remarks , saying that the party was not setting out its red lines yet			0
@entity7 mp @entity151 accused the leadership had misjudged the party ’s enthusiasm for the project			2
he said : ‘ i think the leadership of the labour party misjudged the mood , not just of the @entity159 but the @entity154 in the whole of the country			0
rather than just trying to undermine the project , @entity1 and the rest of them should be out campaigning strongly for it			2
’ sir @entity166 , leader of @entity167 , writing on behalf of councils in @entity53 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity52 , warned of a ‘ protracted public conflict ’ if @entity7 failed to support it .			2
