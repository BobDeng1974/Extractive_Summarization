the old record , set in 2012 , was 60 peeps in two minutes			1
on friday , @entity2 , engaged in the gooey challenge , eating a combination of both yellow — the original — and pink colored of the marshsmallow candy that is shaped like a chick			1
the candy is specially popular around @entity9 , when the manufacturer , @entity10 , comes out with bunny @entity11			1
in a video posted on @entity27 , unwrapped packages of @entity11 can be seen before @entity28 dumps them onto a kitchen counter			2
he then stacks the @entity11 up neatly			2
when he starts eating , he put a row of five peeps in his mouth at a time			2
a counter in the upper left hand corner keeps count			0
dramatic music featuring drums plays in the background			0
in between eating rows , @entity2 takes a drink from a small cup			1
the 100 peeps are laid out on a kitchen counter before @entity2 devoured them			1
an estimated 700 millions @entity11 , made by @entity10 , are eaten every year in the @entity24 at one point , @entity2 spits up a @entity46 , but quickly puts it back in his mouth and keeps on eating			1
when the 100th @entity46 is eaten , a stopwatch reads two minutes and 10 seconds			0
however , @entity2 is not pleased			0
' damnit , i wanted two minutes , ' he says			0
' @entity2 is not an amateur competitive eater			2
he has participated in eating challenges involving tacos , @entity53 ( five in 60 seconds ) and the legendary @entity54 held every july 4th in @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59			0
@entity2 does n't have much time to rest up before his next contest either			0

the first one was held in @entity68 in 2004			0
and there are also @entity11 competitions where people use the candy as characters in dioramas .			0

@entity2 , who participates in other competitive eating contests , broke the old record of 60 peeps in two minutes
he ate a combination of yellow and pink @entity11 , which are shaped into chicks or bunnies and are popular around easter
@entity2 is *disappointed* at the *accomplishment* as he wanted to do it in under two minutes
he will compete in a fried asparagus eating competition on april 26
