by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 07:43 est , 28 december 2012 @entity2 's signing of the bill has angered @entity4 and @entity5 who argue it victimises children president @entity2 has signed a bill banning @entity4 from adopting @entity5 children , less than 24 hours after his office received it from @entity11			1
the bill has angered @entity4 and @entity5 who argue it victimises children to make a political point , cutting off a route out of frequently dismal orphanages for thousands of children			2
the measure is retaliation for an @entity4 law that calls for sanctions against @entity5 officials deemed human rights violators , after @entity5 imprisoned lawyer @entity25 , who later died , after uncovering a Â£ 143million fraud			1
the signing comes hours after a @entity29 court acquitted the only official charged with his death			0
the @entity5 - language hashtag ' @entity32 ' was trending on @entity34 just minutes after @entity2 signed it			0
@entity36 estimates that there are about 740,000 children not in parental custody in @entity5 while about 18,000 @entity5 are on the waiting list to adopt a child			0
the law also blocks dozens of @entity5 children now being adopted by @entity4 families from leaving the country			2
the @entity4 is the biggest destination for adopted @entity5 children - more than 60,000 of them have been taken in by @entity4 over the past two decades			2
the @entity48 says it regrets the @entity5 @entity11 's decision to pass the bill , saying it would prevent many children from growing up in families			0
@entity52 and @entity54 director @entity53 said : ' this bill is frankly a childish response to the @entity57			1
' the @entity58 should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen @entity5 civil society , not weaken it			0
' @entity2 said the @entity62 had ' poisoned relations ' between the two countries children 's rights ombudsman @entity65 says that 46 children who were about to be adopted in the @entity4 would remain in @entity5 if the bill comes into effect			1
mr @entity2 has said that @entity4 authorities routinely let @entity4 suspected of violence toward @entity5 adoptees go unpunished			2
the passage of the bill followed weeks of a hysterical media campaign on @entity77 - controlled television that lambasts @entity4 adoptive parents and adoption agencies that allegedly bribe their way into getting @entity5 children			1
a few mps claimed that some @entity5 children were adopted by @entity4 only to be used for organ transplants and become sex toys or cannon fodder for the @entity88			0
a spokesman with @entity5 's dominant @entity90 said that the children adopted by foreigners and raised outside the church will not ' enter @entity95 's kingdom			0
' loggerheads : @entity2 's actions are seen as a political move against the @entity4 for its recent law which allows sanctions against @entity5 accused of human right violations			1

it is seen as a tit - for - *tat* response to @entity4 bill that will freeze assets of @entity5 accused of human rights abuse
@entity52 *criticises* ' childish ' response
