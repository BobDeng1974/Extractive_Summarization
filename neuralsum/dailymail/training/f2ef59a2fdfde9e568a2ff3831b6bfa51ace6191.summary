by @entity0 from misspelled words to @entity3 characters used at random and @entity5 ' phrases ' that are really gibberish , not every inking turns out as expected			1
now it seems that getting rid of an unwanted tattoo has pitfalls of its own as @entity12 , a 29 - year - old sales manager discovered when she attempted to have hers removed			1
instead of erasing her unwanted etching , botched laser surgery left her skin badly burned while failing to make any difference to the tattoo itself			1
not happy : @entity12 was badly burned and left with terrible scarring after laser tattoo removal went wrong ' i imagine that for some people it would be a small problem but for me , it 's quite big , ' she explains			1
' i 'm trying to make it in my career and i constantly see people looking at it when i wear skirts and high heels			2
' @entity12 's tattoo trouble began at the age of 19 when , in a moment of teenage madness , she decided to get some permanent art etched on her ankle			1
days later , she realised she had made a catastrophic mistake and decided to get the offending tattoo removed			2
' i felt it was tacky , ' she explains , ' so i started to get it lasered but after a few sessions , it [ the tattoo ] got really , really bad			2
' botched : @entity12 's problems began after a bungling surgeon burned her leg while trying to remove her tattoo hidden : @entity12 has to use medical concealer to hide the tattoo - which has resisted all attempts to remove it getting better : @entity12 is embarking on a new course of laser surgery and hopes to be rid of it one day despite her concerns , the woman in charge reassured her that pain and scabbing were normal so @entity12 continued to attend appointments			1
but things were about to get worse			2
' it got infected , to the point that skin was dropping off , ' she reveals			2
' i really should have gone to the gp but i just trusted this woman			0
it became a horrible combination of scar , burn , tattoo , everything in one			2
' now @entity12 is to appear on @entity75 show @entity76 in a bid to finally remove the offending etching , which , thanks to the scarring , has so far resisted every subsequent attempt to remove it			1
so bad is the scarring left by the botched lasering , @entity12 has had to resort to cosmetic camouflage - a type of concealer originally created for burns victims - to hide it			1
speaking about the camouflage , @entity12 adds : ' i really love it			1
i feel like i 've gone back 10 years			0
it 's liberating to be able to stand without having to try and camouflage it			0
' camouflage took a while to master but i 'm very grateful they taught me to do it			0
i 've used it for weddings and business meetings			0
it 's given me a lot of confidence			0
' she has also embarked on a new course of laser therapy , this time with a reputable professional and hopes , one day , to be able to give up the body paint			0
' i 'm really excited to see the results , ' she adds			0
' in a few week 's time , i 'm sure i will see less and less ink			0
' i 'm looking forward to stopping the camouflage , as happy as i was with it			0
it 's too difficult to put on every day so i 'm hoping that at some point in the future , i 'll be able to go out again and just show off my legs			0
' @entity12 appears on @entity76 , thursday night at 8pm on @entity75			1
