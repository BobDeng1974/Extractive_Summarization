question : councillor and father @entity1 has told of his frustration at the deepening political fallout the father whose question led to lord @entity9 ’s remarks suggesting some disabled workers were ‘ not worth ’ the minimum wage told yesterday of his frustration at the deepening political fallout			1
@entity1 said his exchange with the welfare minister at the @entity15 conference last month had been taken out of context as he spoke movingly of the inspirational life of his severely disabled daughter @entity18 , who died six years ago			1
meanwhile @entity19 added to the criticism of lord @entity9 ’s comments , while @entity22 renewed calls for the minister to explain himself			1
mr @entity1 , 63 , a @entity15 councillor for @entity25 in @entity26 , asked @entity9 a question about getting the disabled into work during a fringe meeting at the @entity15 conference			1
in his response @entity9 said : ‘ there is a group , and i know exactly who you mean , where actually as you say they ’re not worth the full wage and actually i ’m going to go and think about that particular issue , whether there is something we can do nationally , and without distorting the whole thing , which actually if someone wants to work for £ 2 an hour , and it ’s working can we actually … ’ the minister ’s response was seized on by @entity49 on wednesday , when he read out a transcript of the exchange in prime minister ’s questions			1
mr @entity1 suggested he was more concerned with getting across his own message than the political row , saying : ‘ major politicians can look after themselves			1
’ he said he wanted to find ways of better integrating disabled people into society – including paying them for work in addition to the benefits they receive			1
‘ @entity72 means not just at home or in shops , but at the workplace and everywhere else			0
‘ what i ’m talking about is finding some way of bringing severely disabled people into the workplace because it can make them feel valued and enhance the lives of those they ’re working with			1
and that feeling of value has nothing to do with money			0
many disabled people are helped into work by a government organisation called @entity91 , which tries to match them with suitable jobs			1
it was set up in 1944 by the then minister for labour @entity94 , and two years later opened its first factory at @entity97 in @entity98			2
many of its workers , who made items such as furniture , were disabled ex-miners			2
but as the factory network grew it also employed soldiers returning from the @entity107			0
at its peak in the late 1980s , the factories employed more than 10,000 people			0
the government subsidised each job to the tune of £ 27,000 a year			0
but state funding was gradually withdrawn because of the growing view that disabled people should be helped to find mainstream jobs , and the factories were closed			2
employment minister @entity119 announced earlier this year that @entity91 – which now helps disabled people into work through placement schemes – was to be privatised			1
‘ when someone goes out to work , whether they are disabled or not , they benefit greatly from that			2
they benefit from doing something , from interacting with people			0
’ he added : ‘ i want severely learning disabled people to have their value recognised , which will include money over and above the benefits they need to live			2
’ mr @entity1 said @entity18 , who had brain damage , was blind , could not talk and used a wheelchair , was too severely disabled to work			1
but many of her other experiences had shown him disabled people should be given as many opportunities as possible			0
with the help of a charity , mr @entity1 and his wife @entity141 , also 63 , were able to arrange for @entity18 to live in a specially adapted house near their own home , where she lived with housemates as well as her carers			1
and in the last year of her life she had the chance to groom and feed horses at a nearby stables			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s about giving people a level of independence and involvement so they can say , “ i am living my life ” rather than life being done to them			1
‘ so many parents of the severely disabled feel that			1
they want their child to be treated as a valued human being			0
’ mr @entity19 said lord @entity9 ’s comments had ‘ caused huge offence ’			1
but he told @entity165 radio : ‘ that should n’t stop any of us having a discussion and , frankly , a difficult discussion , to get more people with disabilities and with other disadvantages in life into the workplace			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity19 ( left ) added to the criticism of the comments made by @entity9 ( right ) @entity178 , which has led criticism of @entity9 , once said the minimum wage had jeopardised jobs for 1,000 disabled people , it emerged yesterday			1
in 2000 , the charity said : ‘ the minimum wage has helped many people with learning disabilities			0
but people who have severe learning disabilities are also employed , even though they may have a productivity rate of 30 per cent of the average			0
‘ an employer may say that they will pay someone £ 15 a week for doing 15 hours work ... unfortunately , if employers have to pay the minimum wage , they may have to let these valuable members of their staff go			0
’ a @entity178 spokesman said : ‘ in the last 15 years , the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed and debate has moved on , as has our position on this issue			2
’ a father said his disabled son would be ‘ over the moon ’ to work for less than the minimum wage - because he would take ‘ three times as long ’ as another employee to do the job			2
@entity211 said his son @entity212 , 32 , who has learning difficulties caused by the genetic condition @entity216 syndrome , would be happy to be paid £ 2 an hour to stack shelves in a supermarket			0
on @entity219 yesterday , the retired engineer , 69 , said his son ‘ would need fairly constant supervision ’ as he struggles with concentration , but that he gets a ‘ profound sense of achievement ’ from working			0
rewarding : @entity211 and @entity226 , of @entity227 , with their daughter @entity228 ( left ) and son @entity212 ( right ) ‘ if @entity212 was receiving a wage packet ... of say , £ 2 an hour , he would just be over the moon , ’ he added			0
mr @entity211 , from @entity231 , @entity227 , said it would not be right to pay all disabled people less – but for those who require supervision it could be fair .			2
