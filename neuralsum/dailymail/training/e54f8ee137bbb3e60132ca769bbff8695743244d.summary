@entity1 mp @entity0 , who represents the @entity3 town , said she now thinks the figures in the @entity5 may be an underestimate sex gangs are continuing to prey on vulnerable young girls in @entity11 despite last year 's damning revelations of systemic and sustained abuse of more than 1,400 girls , the town 's mp has claimed			1
@entity0 , the town 's @entity1 mp since 2012 , has revealed recent publicity had prompted many women to come forward to speak to her about how they had been abused , with around 10 percent of them describing new incidents			1
it comes just weeks after a criminal investigation was launched into a damning new report that found @entity24 was ' not fit for purpose ' and still ' in denial ' about the 1,400 young girls who were abused in the town over 16 years			1
investigators concluded girls as young as 11 were left to be abused by mainly @entity32 men between 1997 and 2013 because the council 's staff and politicians feared being labelled racist			1
ms @entity0 told @entity37 : ' it is still going on , absolutely			1
' it 's usually young women who 've read about this and recognised that this is what happened to them , but it 's also young girls who are still involved			1
' they 're scared , they do n't know what to do and they 're asking for advice			0
' the mp has been vocal in her condemnation of @entity47 and the @entity24 's past conduct			1
this , she told the paper , had led to her becoming a target of intimidation within her own party , and she claimed there were people trying to bully and undermine her , as well as campaign against her			0
the abuse scandal in @entity11 is considered one of the worst in @entity60 's history with experts estimating that 1,400 girls fell into the clutches of paedophiles			1
the damning report , released earlier this month , was written by @entity66 , director - general for troubled families at the government 's @entity68			1
she found the council had a ' deep - rooted ' culture of sexism and bullying where it would ' shoot the messenger ' and sought to force whistleblowers into silence or pay them off			2
inspectors also found the council ' goes to some lengths to cover up information ' and said that children in the town were still at risk of abuse			1
a council researcher claimed files detailing failures in tackling abuse in the town were stolen from her office and never recovered			1
a report by professor @entity89 last august revealed how some 1,400 vulnerable girls had been subjected to rape , violence and trafficking by gangs of mainly @entity32 men in @entity11 ( pictured ) between 1997 and 2013 in october 2014 a @entity97 report called for an urgent investigation into the allegation			1
the committee added that the council and @entity47 ignored ' compelling evidence ' about the scale of the abuse			2
the report said @entity47 also failed in its role to protect victims , turning a blind eye to their plight and in many cases holding them responsible			2
police were said to be aware that a victim was ' raped with a broken bottle ' and some girls were ' ordered to kiss perpetrators ' feet at gun point ' but never took any action			2
in one case an officer told a victim : ' do n't worry - you are n't the first girl to be raped by @entity124 and you wo n't be the last '			0
@entity24 ( pictured ) faces new elections and new management after the damning report the shocking report , released on february 5 , found that @entity11 councillors demonstrated a ' resolute denial ' of what has happened - even after the damning @entity5 revealed the extent of the sex abuse scandal			1
@entity66 said her inspection team found ' a council in denial about serious and on - going safeguarding failures ' as well as a ' culture of covering up uncomfortable truths '			2
she also claimed the council attempted to ' silence whistleblowers and pay off staff ' rather than ' dealing with difficult issues '			2
the report reads : ' @entity144 goes to some length to cover up information and to silence whistleblowers			2
they ( councillors ) denied that there had been a problem , or if there had been , that it was as big as was said			0
' if there was a problem they certainly were not told - it was someone else 's job			2
they were no worse than anyone else			0
the media were out to get them			0
' the report described how there was an ' unhealthy climate ' of ' shoot the messenger ' where people ' feared to speak out because they had seen the consequences of doing so for others '			0
one whistleblower told the inspectors that no - one would ' dare ' use the whistleblowing policy because it ' would come back to bite them in the backside and they would be bullied out of the organisation '			0
another said they were ' proud ' to have blown the whistle , despite it costing ' my job and my career '			0
they said : ' i stepped forward on behalf of young people … it cost me my job and my career			0
i feel it was worth it			0
i am proud to have done so despite the cost to my health and financial situation … the machine at @entity144 does n’t care , wo n’t listen and simply exists to cover up and destroy			0
' one concerned member of staff said threats had been made towards staff who did not toe the line , while another ' feared for reprisals ' if they came forward with information			0
inspectors found that , in two cases involving whistleblowers , officers considered the risk of potential harm to children as secondary to hitting targets or avoiding uncomfortable press coverage			0
the report also highlighted how staff and councillors were dubious about the findings of the @entity5 itself , with some saying they were ' bruised ' by its publication			0
one councillor claimed the accusations were ' biased ' , ' exaggerated ' and motivated by politics			0
she said : ' when inspectors commenced work in @entity11 , we were struck by the overwhelming denial of what professor @entity89 set out in her report			1
she added : ' when asked , 70 per cent of the current @entity11 councillors we spoke to ( including those in the @entity232 ) disputed professor @entity89 's findings			1

girls are still being targeted in @entity11 despite abuse scandal revelation
@entity239 's @entity1 mp @entity0 claims she has spoken to new victims
it follows damning report which said town council is ' not fit for purpose '
last year it was revealed gangs of mostly @entity32 men abused 1,400 girls
abuse was systemic and *unfettered* , and ignored by *relevant* authorities
