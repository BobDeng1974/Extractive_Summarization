prosecutor @entity44 told @entity45 on monday that @entity5 ’s mobile phone internet history showed he logged on to a website offering tips on how to play @entity49 on his @entity31 at 2.22pm			1
the detail of the website , giving step - by - step instruction , meant there would have been little point accessing it unless the game was being played , she added			0
sentencing , mr @entity40 said : ' it ’s the @entity39 ’s case that thereafter , frustrated with the game and with @entity6 screaming , you lost your temper and you assaulted her , gripping her torso hard and violently shaking her			1
' ' whilst it ’s impossible to identify the precise detail of what you did , the injuries that you caused @entity6 speak for themselves			2
' her injuries included bruising to her face , chest , abdomen , hip and lower limbs			1
she also suffered a range of other injuries , including subdural haemorrhages in a number of locations			0
some 16 minutes after @entity5 logged on to the website giving tips on @entity49 , he dialled 999			1
playing games : @entity5 's mobile phone internet history showed he logged on to a website offering tips on how to play @entity49 shortly before calling an ambulance for his dying daughter mr @entity40 told @entity5 : ' whilst you have no recollection now of the fatal incident , it ’s obvious that at the time you appreciated what you had done and in consequence lied and sought to cover up what had actually happened			1
' ' you pretended on the phone that you had a fit			0
you turned off the television to cover up the fact that you had been on the @entity31			0
' ' thereafter you continued to lie and cover up to those who were trying to treat @entity6 , although i stress that they would n’t have done anything different if you had told the truth , and to the police			2
' the judge said there were a number of aggravating features , including the fact that @entity6 was a vulnerable child aged just five weeks old			0
in addition , he said @entity5 was in a position of trust , made repeated false accounts to cover up his actions , and had shown no real remorse			2
the judge accepted it was a ' momentary ' event lacking in premeditation and he sought emergency help , albeit giving a misleading account			0
mr @entity40 said @entity5 - who sobbed with his head down as he was sentenced - will serve half his jail sentence			2
on release , he will be on licence for the remainder of his sentence and if he breaks the terms , will be liable for recall			0
concealed his crime : @entity5 initially claimed he had suffered an epileptic fit and came round to find his daughter underneath him on the day of the fatal attack , @entity6 ’s mother was attending her first class for an applied social science degree at the @entity141 ’s @entity140 campus			1
during a break at around lunchtime , she sent @entity5 a text message asking after @entity6 , to which he replied : ' she has n’t shut up since about half an hour after you left			1

i had a fit and when i woke up the baby was underneath me			0
' @entity6 was admitted to the @entity157 in @entity14 unconscious , unresponsive and , although a heart - beat was re-established , she was unable to maintain respiratory effort without life support			2
she was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at @entity162 , @entity163 , but died on november 9 2012			0
miss @entity164 said the combination of the post-mortem findings of recent head injury , recent traumatic laceration of the liver and recent fracture of the left clavicle was consistent with inflicted injury of the ' shaking / impact type '			0
dr @entity174 , a consultant neurologist , found it was ' highly unlikely ' that a seizure was a substantial contributor to @entity6 ’s injuries			2
if he had suffered a seizure , dr @entity174 would have expected him to drop anything he was holding and remember later			0
miss @entity164 said : ' even if he had fallen on to @entity6 , her pattern of injuries is not consistent with a fall and crushing alone			2
dr @entity174 would have expected more disturbance to adjacent furniture than reported			0
' one expert found @entity6 sustained two episodes that had led to injury - one up to three weeks before she died and a second up to five days before death			2
when @entity5 was told he would be arrested , miss @entity164 said he became upset and he said : ' i suppose you are going to say that you know what it is like to be accused of killing your daughter			0
' in one police interview , he declined to answer most questions , except when he was asked if he had deliberately harmed her			0
he replied : ' no. ' miss @entity164 said @entity5 , who had an “ unconventional upbringing ” and was raised by his paternal grandparents , made suicide bids in 2006			0
two years later , he was diagnosed with @entity203 , a rare condition of the peripheral nervous system , following which he began experiencing seizures			0
but the court heard that no medical cause could be found to explain them and he was admitted to numerous hospitals between 2008 and 2012 .			0
