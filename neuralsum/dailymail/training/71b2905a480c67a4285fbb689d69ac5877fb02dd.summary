by @entity0 follow @ @ ralphellis56 @entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football			2
this week , 18 - year - old @entity7 full back @entity5 proves he still has things to improve on defensively in his game , why @entity11 goal poacher @entity10 is failing to find the back of the net and @entity15 's 5ft 6in midfielder is more than a match against bigger opposition ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... nominee : @entity15 striker @entity19 is on the shortlist for @entity21 after a stellar season 1			1
@entity19 is massive odds - on favourite to be the @entity21 ’s @entity25 as a reward not only for his @entity15 goals but his reformed disciplinary record , with @entity30 second favourite in recognition of the way he has led the team ’s title challenge			1
spare a thought , then , for @entity37 who is n’t even on the shortlist , even though @entity39 are still just in the title race and are also in the @entity42 semi-finals			2
aged 33 , the @entity44 skipper has played in 44 of his club ’s 51 matches , one more than @entity30 including the @entity15 captain ’s @entity48 games			1
@entity37 has also had just four yellow cards against his name , which is one less than @entity19 – and @entity39 have the best defensive record in the @entity53 despite saturday ’s shock defeat by @entity55			1
natural leader : @entity39 captain @entity37 did n't make the list despite playing in 44 of his club 's 51 games 2			1
@entity60 rightly gave praise to @entity7 ’s @entity5 for his attacking zest at @entity63 , but they glossed over the promising young @entity48 star ’s defensive stats			1
@entity66 gave the 18 - year - old a tough second half , which included @entity5 picking up only his third yellow card of the season for hauling down the @entity63 winger			1
@entity66 found space to put in 11 crosses in all – only @entity73 attempted more in saturday ’s games – and it was a relief for @entity7 that @entity63 had nobody to get on the end of them			1
raw talent : @entity7 's @entity5 ( left ) had a difficult afternoon against @entity63 's @entity66 ( right ) 3			1
it ’s a measure of @entity11 ’s problems that @entity10 , sent on to chase the game at @entity83 with half an hour left , managed just one shot – which was blocked – in that time			1
the 25 - year - old @entity85 is a natural goal poacher who needs people to make openings for him , which might explain his worst ever season at @entity92 with just seven goals			2
he ’s had 1,288 minutes on the pitch in all competitions making it a goal every 184 minutes under @entity99 – compared to one every 110 minutes as he helped sir @entity103 ’s title winning team with a total of 14 in 1,541 minutes last season			2
goal drought : @entity11 striker @entity10 ( left ) is having his worst season in @entity48 4			1
if any player typifies the way @entity111 has got the best from a group of players who were unproven at top level it is defender @entity117			0
the 24 - year - old , naturally a centre half when he made a £ 400,000 move to @entity121 from @entity122 two years ago , has played every minute of every game in three different positions since @entity111 took over			0
starting at right back , he then became a holding midfield man , and has now switched to left back during the club ’s record run of five straight @entity53 wins			1
he kept former @entity48 winger @entity128 quiet in the 1 - 0 success at @entity130 , as well as making more clearances than any other @entity121 defender			0
mr @entity133 : @entity117 ( centre ) has played in every minute for @entity121 since boss @entity111 took charge 5			0
@entity137 ’s @entity136 is paying a high price for the red card he collected for a lunging tackle on @entity142 midfielder @entity141 last month			0
the @entity144 international set up a club record for 103 consecutive @entity53 appearances earlier this season – but since returning from his three - match ban he ’s been relegated to the subs bench			1
@entity149 has given him just 18 minutes in three games – although he ’s doing his bit to win back a starting place			2
in the five minutes he did get on at @entity153 he hit the bar and created two chances for team mates			0
out in the cold : @entity137 's @entity136 has n't started for the club since returning from his three - match ban 6			1
@entity160 showed flashes of promise at @entity163 but is still struggling to live up to his record price tag despite @entity165 getting back on track to reach the @entity42			2
the @entity169 whose £ 42.5 million signing was supposed to bring world class creativity was involved in the build - up to @entity173 ’s early goal			0
but , by the time he was taken off after just over an hour , he had n’t directly created a chance for a team mate or had any sort of attempt on goal himself			2
value for money ? @entity165 's £ 42.5 million record signing @entity160 has had an up and down debut season 7			2
@entity183 at just 5ft 6ins tall is quite capable of looking after himself in the @entity53 ’s land of the giants			1
the @entity185 played a key role for @entity15 in the win at @entity142 that put the @entity188 within touching distance of the title			1
given the task of replacing suspended @entity192 in midfield , the £ 15million signing from manager @entity194 ’ old club @entity195 won ten tackles in his 81 minutes on the field , as well as getting forward to have a couple of attempts on goal			0
little gem : @entity15 's @entity183 ( left ) had an impressive game during their 3 - 2 win at @entity142 on sunday 8			1
@entity205 ’s capture of giant striker @entity206 , a flop in his first attempt to play in @entity210 football at @entity211 , has transformed @entity213 ’s season			0
the 6ft 6ins @entity215 , without a club when he signed on at the @entity218 in march after being released by @entity219 , scored twice at @entity220 for the win which lifted the @entity222 out of the relegation zone			0
@entity213 have won three and drawn one of the four games in which the 31 - year - old has started			0
giant impact : @entity206 ( far left ) has n't lost a game in a @entity213 shirt when he has started 9			2
@entity236 ’s strategy of playing musical footballers with the players from @entity239 and @entity240 , the other clubs belonging to their owners the @entity234 family , might not have brought them success this season but at least provides some bright spots for @entity245 fans by giving them players they could n’t otherwise afford			0
@entity249 winger @entity248 once cost @entity15 £ 8million , but is now waiting to link up with @entity240 after signing a pre-contract following his release from @entity252			1
meanwhile the 31 - year - old has been parked at @entity236 and gave a reminder of his talent with the first goal in a 3 - 1 win that dented @entity259 ’s play - off hopes			0
all smiles : ex-liverpool midfielder @entity261 ( centre ) scored on his @entity236 debut vs @entity259 on saturday 10			0
former @entity265 boss @entity264 once put a £ 1million price tag on striker @entity267 , who he signed on a free transfer from @entity269 in august 2011			0
the 23 - year - old is proving every bit as valuable for current boss @entity272 after his 14th goal of this season sparked a 3 - 0 win over @entity276 which all but guaranteed a place in the @entity279 play - offs			0
stockily built @entity267 , rejected by @entity280 at the start of his career , has now got 37 goals from 69 starts during his @entity265 career			0
invaluable : @entity288 striker @entity267 ( second right ) has scored 37 goals from 69 starts for the club			0

@entity7 full back had a tough time against @entity66
@entity10 's *goalscoring* struggles at @entity11 *continue*
@entity15 's @entity183 proves size does n't matter in the @entity53
