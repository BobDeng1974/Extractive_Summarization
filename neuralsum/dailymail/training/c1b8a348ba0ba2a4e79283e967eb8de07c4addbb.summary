a raging @entity1 making the roof fall in ; @entity3 coming in at breakfast time straight from a night out before playing his match ; a magical moment with @entity7 just after he won the title			1
these are just a few of the gems in the treasure chest of memories @entity13 took away with him from 44 years of looking after generations of stars in the locker rooms of @entity17			1
he left the @entity18 last summer after stumbling into the job during the summer of 1969 and feels ‘ privileged ’ to have seen close up the world ’s greatest players experience the private agony of defeat and the ecstasy of victory			2
raging : @entity1 , always a character , made the roof fall in , @entity13 says as a steward in the inner sanctum of @entity17 ’s main locker room , he bears unique witness to @entity17 history			1
@entity13 ( no relation ) spent the last 18 years as head steward and it ended in fairytale fashion on the last day of his last championships , with fellow @entity37 @entity7 ending the 77 - year wait for a @entity41 men ’s champion			1
while @entity13 ’s love for tennis and all its players shines through , it is clear @entity7 is among his favourites			1
one of his duties was to carry out the racket bags of the men ’s finalists onto court and supervise their removal at the end			2
so it was that he was the first person to encounter the new champion when he stepped off @entity57 on that heady afternoon 12 months ago			0
long service : @entity13 , pictured with one of the rackets @entity7 used in the 2013 final , was a locker room attendant at @entity17 for 44 years ‘ the first thing @entity64 said to me was “ do n’t i get a hug then ? ” so i gave him a hug			1
but i just could n’t speak , i was too choked up for him , ’ says @entity13			1
it tells you something about @entity7 ’s true character that the following friday , @entity13 ’s last day at work , the champion went back to the @entity18 to say goodbye , presenting him with a signed racket he used in the final			1
‘ it is my most treasured possession but that ’s the kind of bloke @entity64 is and maybe people do n’t always see , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ he is basically a very kind and thoughtful person , with a great sense of humour , too			2
’ not so happy : @entity1 smashed open a ceiling after a first round loss at @entity17 one year @entity13 also witnessed players at their most angry and frustrated and one afternoon in 1986 with @entity1 stands out			1
he says : ‘ @entity1 was an amazing competitor and character and he had lost in the first round			0
he came in afterwards and hurled his racket at the ceiling			0
‘ the problem was that at the time it was one of these false ceilings of thin panels held up by thin metal plates			0
somehow he completely dislodged a number of them and left a huge hole , with all the dust and debris that had accumulated on top crashing down			0
‘ he was so angry that he stripped off to his jockstrap and socks and stormed off down the corridor to the transport room , right by the entrance to the @entity105			2
‘ my colleague , @entity106 , had to run after him and cover him with a towel so there would n’t be any surprises for anyone coming out of the @entity105			2
he was driven off straight away			0
’ it is the hugely charismatic former world @entity113 — who was to die tragically young at 40 — who left the biggest imprint			0
gift : through all the years of experience at the @entity120 , @entity7 's parting present was special ‘ i never met anyone with such a sheer appetite for life , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ he came in one morning about eight o’clock in jeans and a smart jacket and told me that he had n’t been to bed yet			1
‘ so i found him a physio ’s couch in a quiet corner to lie down			2
i gave him a shake and a cup of coffee an hour later and he was straight up and about			0
then he went out a bit later and won his match			0
’ unthinkable now but it was a different age when @entity13 , an accountant by training , first arrived at @entity138			1
@entity139 was the big beast back then and was halfway through winning all four majors			0
‘ @entity139 was quite a shy , quiet man , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ what marked him and @entity143 out was that it was clear they were very much there for business			0
‘ there were still a lot of guys from the amateur days around but those two were extremely professional			0
’ the advent of @entity152 heralded the start of the great tennis boom of the @entity155 and @entity156 , with unprecedented scenes of adulation at the @entity18			1
‘ it was like @entity160 and caused quite a few problems , ’ @entity13 recalls			1
‘ for the first time security and protection was needed to get him from his car into the main building because he was getting mobbed , mainly by young girls			0
‘ some people at the club were very uncomfortable with it all			0
inside the locker room he had this @entity172 - like calm			1
the biggest challenge for us was finding somewhere to put his rackets			0
in those days players still might have only two or three but @entity152 would come in with 18 or 20 , sometimes we ’d just have to pile them on top of the lockers			1
’ and then came the incomparable @entity179 , another star @entity13 especially liked , along with @entity181			1
he says : ‘ i ’d talk a lot with @entity179 because i was into @entity184 sports			0
‘ he was just this @entity184 college kid when he first came in			0
he was very different off the court to on it			0
one thing he did was always keep a racket back in his locker at room temperature — when word came from the court that he wanted his spare racket you knew he was having a bad day			1
’ @entity13 rarely saw tempers fray between players in the locker room and , while he wants to keep such incidents private , he makes the interesting observation that the cause is often something said during matches by an opponent ’s entourage or over enthusiastic support			1
popular : @entity152 was the first player who needed security to get him from his car into the main building in the present era a calmer example is set by the top players			1
‘ @entity212 [ @entity213 ] was a bit hotheaded as a junior but you could quickly tell the others feared him because he was so good , ’ says @entity13			2
‘ he is very statesman - like and reminds me a bit of @entity139 because of the business - like way he goes about things			0
‘ the small thing i ’ll remember about @entity224 [ @entity225 ] was how brilliant he was at geography			2
‘ there was this computer game the players liked in which you had to pinpoint cities on a blank map of @entity233 , he was incredibly good at it , he is very intelligent			0
‘ he has become different from most in that he now spends hardly any time in the locker room , he ’ll plan it so he only comes in the minimal time before his matches			1
@entity239 [ @entity240 ] — you ca n’t help but like him , there is still this boy - next - door quality and he is incredibly nice with people			2
after a good win @entity239 likes to celebrate with an ice cream , so it was important to make sure that the freezer was stocked with them			0
’ these days the main locker room is open to the world ’s top 50 , the top four doubles pairings , plus players who are @entity18 members , regardless of their rankings , such as past champions			1
gone are the exposed pipes and communal baths , replaced by power showers , treatment rooms and private bathrooms — except they are never used for baths as most people would know them			0
‘ i have n’t run a hot bath for anyone for about 15 years , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ if anyone goes in the bath it ’s for an ice bath — or they go in there to have some privacy and maybe shed some tears in private			2
‘ it ’s important to know when to leave people alone and that ’s where they ’ll often go			2
‘ players have different ways of reacting to defeat			0
‘ @entity281 [ the @entity282 former top - 10 singles player ] had this ritual where he would come in after a loss and stare in silence at his locker for up to an hour			2
then he would physically rip the shirt off himself and move on , as if he had achieved closure			0
’ watchful eye : @entity225 's practice is watched over by coach @entity291 as he limbers up at @entity138 as tennis has evolved into a massive international business with huge prize money , the atmosphere has become more serious , although not without elements of fun			2
‘ the putting competition has become a big thing now , almost everyone joins in , ’ says @entity13			2
‘ it started with someone bringing in one of those cup - like golf holes that spit the ball out but now it ’s become almost like crazy golf			0
‘ the hole has become so long that they start it in the showers			0
‘ there is still a lot of banter			0
all tennis players seem to be football crazy and that ’s what a lot of it is about			0
‘ an important thing in the years of a big football championship is to make sure you get the right matches on the tvs along with the tennis			0
’ that will be the case this year but one of the most established fixtures in the locker room will not be there to supervise it , gone the same way as many of the traditional features at an institution which has ruthlessly renewed itself			1
there will be many players who miss the avuncular , reassuring presence of a familiar figure in his white steward ’s coat — and the feeling will be mutual			0
@entity13 's last day working during a @entity17 fortnight was quite special ... it was the day @entity7 ended @entity41 ’s 77 - year wait for a men ’s champion			1
and @entity7 made it even more special the following friday			2
it was @entity13 ’s last official day at work and @entity7 , now the proud @entity17 champion , returned to the @entity18 to say farewell and present his fellow @entity37 with one of the rackets he had used in the final			1
‘ it is my most treasured possession , ’ says @entity13 , ‘ but that ’s the kind of bloke @entity64 is			1
’ special day : @entity13 ( left ) carries the bags of @entity7 ( centre ) and @entity225 before the 2013 final			1

@entity362 talks to retired @entity17 locker room attendant @entity13
@entity7 the joker , @entity225 the geographer ... and why @entity17 *frowned* on @entity152 ’s screaming *female* fans
@entity13 on the late , great @entity3 : ' @entity3 came in one morning at about eight o’clock in jeans and told me he had n’t been to bed ! '
