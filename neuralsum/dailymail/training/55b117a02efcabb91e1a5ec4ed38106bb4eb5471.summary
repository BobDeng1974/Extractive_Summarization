it ’s been one of the most highly anticipated pc games of 2013 , yet with huge server issues following its launch in the @entity6 – the release of @entity8 in the @entity9 was overshadowed by its crippling servers			1
credit where it ’s due , however ; @entity13 have made a very good game			0
for those if you who have n’t been exposed to previous @entity8 titles – these series of games focus on city building as the player assumes the role of @entity24 and all the responsibilities that come with it from harvesting resources , ensuring your ‘ sims ’ have enough power and water to live , garbage is cleared , sewage is removed and that your city does n’t descend into a crime - filled , arson - loving metropolis			1
and it ’s in the control of all these aspects that the real fun is had			0
beautiful world : there is no escaping the fact that @entity8 is a wonderful - looking game when players first start the game they will be required to access one of a number of servers ( a lot more now than on the first day of launch )			1
one of the strange things about @entity8 is that each server is standalone ; meaning if you start a city of one server and then have to or want to access another server , your city will not move with you			1
players will then be taken through the tutorial that runs you through the key foundations of running a city			2
this gives @entity8 players of all experiences a good outline on how to begin running their own cities			2
potential mayors learn of city specialisation ; where you can focus on the production of oil , coal , tourism , casinos and trade			1
city specialisation is all part of @entity13 ’ aim of bringing a more social aspect to @entity8 unlike previous titles			1
players can choose to start their own region or pick a zone within another players ’ region – encouraging play with friends			0
each zone has its own resources , some with high quantities of water , oil or coal allowing for one friend to focus on the production of one resource and sharing it amongst neighbours whilst another friend does the same			0
this is one great asset of @entity8 ; playing in the same region as friends or other players allows for more focussed city building , not to mention @entity105 that multiple players can team up to research and build			2
each great works ; @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , has its own benefits to the region and is a key focus once your city of fully established			0
lighting up the night sky : how you build your city is entirely up to you whilst building your city players are given constant feedback on how the city is developing through the all - new @entity8			1
advisors will regularly pop up to offer advice whilst players can also zoom in to street level and see the happiness or complaints of its citizens			0
various data maps offer key insights on how well your city is performing and allow for players to experience an unrivalled level of constantly available detail and help their city blossom			0
old - school @entity8 players will be glad that roads can now be curvy allowing players to give their city a more unique feel instead of the usual grid by grid			1
however the constraints on city size can render curved roads obsolete as players will find themselves designing cities to pack in as much urbanism as possible			0
past @entity8 titles catered for a lot more expansion and larger city size whereas the focus on city specialisation , sharing resources and social play has been at the detriment of the dream of a sprawling city housing multiple hundreds of thousands of sims			1
@entity8 ’s always - online @entity161 gameplay , requiring players to be constantly online to play , has been hot topic since it was announced in 2012 and even more so after the server troubles the @entity6 experienced			1
sight for sore eyes : it 's very rewarding watching your city come together and the camera offers a great view however @entity170 and @entity13 rectified most , but not all issues prior to @entity9 launch			2
many users have had a few problems logging in or accessing their server of choice , so much so that @entity170 are offering a free game on @entity178 to all those who have played @entity8 up to the 18th march			2
a nice gesture , but one they should never have had to offer			0
@entity8 is a fantastic game , offering great replay value and an engaged social experience			1
it ’s been unfortunate that it ’s suffered server troubles yet this does n’t detract from the fact that this is a very well built game			0
a lot of fun can be had and there ’s nothing more satisfying than ‘ plopping ’ down building after building and watching your city grow			0
