' she said : ' it was as if @entity1 was put on this earth to do such wonderful things , to help anybody that needed him			1
' he touched everyone he knew and he had thousands of friends			0
i am so proud to have been @entity1 's mother			1
the world is a poorer place without him			0
' mr @entity1 had been tasked with dismantling machinery at the plant in @entity50 before @entity51 moved operations to their headquarters in @entity54 , @entity55			1
but as he removed a large metal overhead pipe it fell and landed on his head , causing extensive skull fractures and brain injuries			2

judge @entity89 said no risk assessment or detailed plans for removing the pipework had been produced after it was overlooked during initial work			2
on top of this the supervisor tasked with overseeing the final stages of the operation was unqualified for demolition projects and had never been given any health and safety training relevant to the task in hand			0
factory : mr @entity1 had an accident at this factory where the innocent smoothie brand was made in @entity6 the large pipe should have been removed using scaffolding but despite an agreement that it would be put in place there was no formal instruction given			1
instead , plans to pull down the pipe were made by removing bolts before pulling it away from its fixtures from below with ropes			0
judge @entity117 said there had been a breakdown in communication and the lack of detailed plans for the work meant @entity1 , as a keen , hard - working employee , took it upon himself to take down the last heavy metal pipe by himself			2

' but he recognised the firm had an otherwise untarnished health and safety record			0

he said : ' any demolition or dismantling work must be set down in writing and strictly monitored , as the law requires			0
