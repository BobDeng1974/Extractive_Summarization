the @entity0 has launched a major political drive for rule changes to ensure a minimum of four home - grown players in starting line - ups for every club match from the @entity8 down			1
@entity0 chief executive @entity9 met @entity10 , the mp leading the @entity12 's policy review , on monday to push the union 's position aimed at increasing the number of @entity17 players at the top of the professional game			1
@entity9 also plans to meet the government to argue the case for quotas of home - grown players , with each starting xi having four with at least one trained by the club			1
@entity27 was one of only four home - grown players on the pitch when @entity31 met @entity32 @entity9 says @entity27 's man of the match performance shows @entity17 players should get a chance it would need the agreement of the @entity38 , the @entity8 and the @entity39 to bring in the rules , but winning political support from the main parties would be a big boost to the @entity0			1
@entity9 said @entity38 chairman @entity45 's announcement of moves to reduce the number of @entity49 players in @entity17 football was welcome but ' a drop in the ocean ' and that radical action is needed			2
@entity9 told @entity54 : ' the key is starting on the field of play and to have at least four home - grown players of which one should be club - grown			1
with so much money going into youth development we need to see some return from that			0
' look at sunday , there were only four @entity17 players in the @entity31 v @entity32 teams and the best player on the pitch was one of them , @entity27			2
' we have a meeting with the head of the @entity12 's policy review about our concerns on youth development			0
the fall - out rate has been so high that if we were a university we would probably have been closed down			0
@entity0 chief executive @entity9 complained that the fall - out rate for @entity17 talent is much too high @entity45 has announce plans to limit the number of non-eu players but the @entity0 say it is n't enough ' unless we tweak the system with regards to quotas i do n't see how that 's going to improve			1
' earlier this month i saw @entity90 under - 19s draw with the @entity92 under - 19s who were the @entity94 champions - we were the best team and i was so impressed but you wonder what opportunities they are going to get in senior football			0
' we will also be approaching the current government on these issues as well			0
' @entity9 also wants political support for the @entity0 's backing of the ' @entity104 ' to encourage more black and ethnic minority coaches - there is only one black manager in the 92 league clubs , @entity106 at @entity108			1
the ' @entity104 ' , used in @entity109 , would oblige clubs to shortlist at least one black / ethnic minority candidate for each coaching position			0
@entity113 is one of very few young @entity17 players who have broken through to first team football @entity116 had to move clubs after finding his path to first team football blocked by expensive imports @entity9 is also pushing for the @entity38 board to include representatives from the @entity0 , fans and the @entity124			2
the @entity0 chief said the @entity38 's move to toughen up the work permit rules for @entity129 players was to be welcomed but would only have a very limited effect on the number of @entity17 players in the top flight			2
he added : ' the fact is there are so many countries that are either in the @entity49 , or have trade agreements that are permit - free , and then you have @entity140 players with passports from @entity142 and @entity143 , and @entity144 with @entity146 passports			0
' it 's just going to be a drop in the ocean			0
