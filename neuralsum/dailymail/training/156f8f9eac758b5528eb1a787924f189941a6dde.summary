and there are concerns for students currently carrying out charity expeditions around the world after trip organiser @entity24 , operating as @entity25 , ceased trading and cancelled all of its services			1

' the statement said the company is being placed into liquidation ‘ despite the best efforts ’ of its directors and stakeholders			0
@entity77 added : ‘ this is a great shock and extremely disappointing for many students who planned to fundraise for numerous charities			1

he said : ‘ i ’m really concerned that she ’s stuck in in @entity121 and she ca n’t get out , but we ’ll find out			0

’ a group of students was scheduled to trek along the @entity131 for two weeks in september despite all of the uncertainty , he is still hoping his daughter , who is pursuing a career as a volcanologist , will be able to scale the dormant volcanic mountain after raising £ 3,400 for the @entity107			1
she collected cash from family and friends , and held events in the community to collect donations from strangers			0

the 19 - year - old said she has spent up to £ 2,500 on the trip , including about £ 1,500 paid directly to @entity25 , while fundraising for the @entity107			1
she said : ‘ it ’s just so infuriating			0
so many people , my family , put so much into it			0
even if i get the money back it does n’t solve anything			0
’ @entity25 takes travellers to places such as the @entity176 base camp while supporting charities @entity178 , a recent graduate of the @entity104 who was supposed to depart for @entity18 on tuesday , said she is feeling frustrated because of the confusion			1
the 21 - year - old said : i ’m absolutely gutted			0
i ’m devastated because we ’ve all put in so much hard work , so much time and so much money			0
’ she managed to raise over £ 3,000 for @entity155			0
she added : ‘ i can only hope that the charities are going to get the full amount of money			2
’ @entity24 was atol bonded until the end of march but its licence was not renewed with the @entity193 , the @entity190 reported			1

@entity106 said : ‘ there is a lot of disappointment			0
a lot of them have worked extremely hard and we have sympathy for them			0

in a statement , @entity254 , @entity255 's director of business recovery , said : ' @entity24 ’s challenges were perfect for students due to the budget price and the high interest amongst students wanting to travel and try something new			1
' unfortunately budget prices often mean very small margins for companies and unfortunately , in the case of @entity24 , these small profit margins ultimately led to the liquidation of the company			1
' student adventures has not posted any information on its website as of friday afternoon , and the company ’s @entity274 and @entity275 accounts have been deleted			0
@entity24 ( @entity277 ) was founded in 2007 .			1
