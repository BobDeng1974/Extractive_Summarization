@entity0 is a midfield maestro			1
in what has been a stellar career , his highlights include unforgettable @entity4 wins with @entity5 and @entity6 and helping @entity7 conquer the world			1
he is now aiming to make history with @entity10 and , in his first interview with an @entity13 newspaper since moving to @entity14 , he outlined his ambitions to @entity17 ’s @entity16			1
here are the 10 best quotes from that brilliant interview			2
@entity0 ( left ) opens up to former @entity5 team - mate and @entity17 columnist @entity16 @entity0 and @entity16 enjoyed many jokes during a revealing and insightful interview @entity0 was in high spirits as he sat down to talk at @entity10 's training ground click here to read the brilliant full interview with @entity10 star @entity0 on leaving @entity6 : no. i only had this option			1
there were times i heard some @entity13 clubs said ' what would he think ' but my idea was to stay in @entity6			1
then when i heard of @entity37 ’s interest i said : ' @entity0 , think what you want and where you will be happy '			1
i needed a fresh start somewhere			1
this might be my last experience in football			2
i came from my hometown team , @entity45 , to the best team in @entity13 ( smiles ) ; to the best team in @entity7 to the best team in @entity14			1
i would say it is a beautiful career			2
i wanted a nice football script			1
i can not be a one club man like you ! on seeing @entity5 draw @entity6 in the @entity4 : ( puts hands over face ) oh my gosh ! i was actually in the middle of doing my medical here			1
i came out from the scan and saw it … on @entity13 teams struggling defensively in @entity61 : to be fighting at @entity64 level , you need players who know how to play in the big games			2
at this moment , @entity68 and @entity14 teams have that			2
@entity13 teams have changed so much			2
only now do @entity71 look solid			2
@entity5 did very well last year but this season they are struggling			1
@entity73 have won the league twice in three years but they can not find that mentality in @entity61			2
@entity78 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity73 when the teams met in september @entity81 was left helpless as @entity78 ( not pictured ) scored the only goal in @entity10 's 1 - 0 win over @entity73 on importance of adaptability : each team i see ( that is successful ) has to be comfortable playing three systems			1
they need to adapt to each game , depending on the circumstances			2
it is not about not being loyal to your identity			0
no , no , no. it is about knowing your strengths and showing your players what you need to do each game to prepare in the right way			0
in @entity5 , you know what it was like : we had a plan for each team			1
every game is totally different			0
let me give you an example			0
this season we have played with three defenders , sometimes four , sometimes five			1
you need to be able to manage at least three or four systems			0
it has nothing to do with betraying your principles of football			0
on @entity118 being the best player in world : for sure			1
i said recently if @entity122 or another @entity14 player won the @entity124 , it would be fair as they won the @entity125			1
but if @entity118 wins it again , it would also be fair for the season he had , winning the @entity4			1
he is the best player i have played			1
after you , of course ! @entity0 moved to @entity6 in the summer and says he is enjoying life under @entity133 @entity118 is the best player @entity0 has played with during his stellar career @entity0 and @entity118 ( right ) were once rivals playing for @entity5 and @entity136 on a lack of understanding rather than technique letting @entity13 players down : yes , for sure			1
when i was in @entity5 , i was reading the programme before a match one day			1
there was an interview with a 12 - year - old from the @entity147			1
he was asked what his main strengths were			0
his answer ? shooting and tackling			0
i said to myself ' ok but i do n’t think the main quality of player should be tackling '			1
it must be something else			0
on what type of player can play holding midfield : you need someone who thinks ' what is best : attack ? defence ? ' you have to know when to take two or three steps to make space , then you know you will be able to pass to someone between the lines			1
players do n’t have to move			0
@entity133 says this always to @entity170 ( jumps up and starts pointing )			0
' you – do n’t run ! stay there ! the ball will come to you			0
do n’t move ! ' he shows clips to the team of @entity170 standing still for 10 seconds			2
@entity133 works so much about the positional game			0
it is not about running everywhere			0
it is about you staying there and the others have to work to get it to you			0
on @entity16 's view that @entity7 would win nothing : i know ! i remember ! what did you say ? ( puts on fake @entity5 accent ) ' @entity7 ? @entity7 ! ca n’t run ! ca n’t run ! ' you got the gold medal for the loudest player i played with			1
i remember at @entity192 , in 2009			0
we are winning 2 - 0 , the game is won and ( @entity196 ) @entity195 tries to run the ball out of defence			2
next thing i hear : ( jumps up ) ' eh ! eh ! you ! @entity195 ! you ’re not @entity203 ! ' @entity0 enjoys scoring for @entity7 against @entity204 at @entity205 ( left ) and shielding the ball from @entity207 @entity16 ( left ) and @entity0 ( second right ) were part of @entity211 's ( centre ) successful @entity5 team @entity0 and @entity16 ( left ) team up to try to contain @entity214 in a @entity4 game in 2005 on @entity7 's success : when @entity217 ( @entity218 ) is on top of his game mentally , he ’s the best			1
in midfield we had ( @entity224 ) @entity223 , @entity225 , ( @entity226 ) @entity227 , myself			0
playing with so many midfielders was our strength			0
we did n’t have great players in one - against - one situations			2
it took a lot of short passes to create the last chance			0
then , when we did , we had @entity237 and @entity238 , who were on top form			0
on his future after retiring ( and the possibility of becoming a pundit ) : a pundit ( more laughter ) ! probably i will take my badges			0
i have lots of things in my mind			0
with the managers i have worked for , i have learned a lot			0
but there is another side			0
you can not take that step too quickly			0
would i walk away from football ? sometimes you think you need that break but you need something else .			0
