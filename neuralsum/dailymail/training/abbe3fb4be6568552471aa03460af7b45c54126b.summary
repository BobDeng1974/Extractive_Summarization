doctors listed on the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) website charge patients – many of whom are dying – up to £ 3,000 to administer high doses of intravenous @entity5 , despite it being clinically unproven against any form of cancer			1
yet a description on the website makes it sound like a virtual panacea , suggesting it can be used against all kinds of conditions			0
medical experts last night described the claims as ‘ quackery ’ and called for the @entity25 to investigate			1
one has already reported @entity8 to the @entity26			2
until last week , @entity8 ’s website carried a glowing endorsement from actress @entity29 , but when it was drawn to her attention by @entity31 she said she had no memory of the words ascribed to her			2

it also claims @entity5 therapy ‘ can be used in any stage of cancer ’			1
experts say the claims – accompanied by a list of doctors offering the therapy at more than £ 3,000 – could be in breach of @entity88 , which outlaws the promotion of false claims to cure cancer			1
