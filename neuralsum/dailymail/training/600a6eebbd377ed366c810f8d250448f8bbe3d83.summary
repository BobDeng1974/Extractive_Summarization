long before @entity0 announced he was mulling a third presidential run , his handlers scheduled a sit - down meeting in @entity4 for thursday with @entity5 – and the get - together is still on the calendar			1
@entity0 and @entity5 are now both engaged in the business of figuring out whether to campaign for the @entity10 , a process that involves currying favor with elected officials and buttering up donors			1
in some cases , they 're hitting up the same people just hours apart			0
an @entity18 producer caught up with @entity5 at @entity19 outside @entity20 , apparently about to board a flight for @entity22 , @entity4			0
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity23 confirmed that the meeting is scheduled to take place today			2
two prominent @entity44 members spoke to the paper on wednesday night			0
@entity0 shocked some observers two weeks ago by encouraging a small group of donors during a @entity52 meeting to tell their friends that he was considering a return to the campaign trail			2
@entity5 had already announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee in mid-december , and launched a political action committee this month			2
he proposed meeting with @entity0 in order to make a public show of respect – the kind of photo - op gesture that would signal his embrace of continuity among the @entity44 's moderate center			1
but now the two men will likely compete for the hearts , minds and wallets of that constituency			0
@entity44 insiders fear that a bruising and protracted battle between the two men could leave whichever of them survives compromised and bloodied headed into a november 2016 confrontation with @entity76 or another moneyed @entity77			1
or worse , according to one financier who says he has pledged to support @entity5 , ' the two could take each other down and open the door wide enough for a more divisive candidate to overtake them both			0
' she awaits : former secretary of state @entity76 has a cakewalk path to the @entity87 nomination in front of her , unlike the swuabbling @entity44 contenders all smiles ( in 2012 ! ) : @entity5 rode on @entity0 's campaigns plane for appearances in @entity37 a week before the last presidential election that 's a reference to the party 's conservative wing , populated by prospective candidates like sens. @entity99 and @entity100 , and the pugnacious @entity102 gov. @entity101			1
meanwhile the @entity39 notes that @entity5 was n't particularly helpful to @entity0 during his unsuccessful 2012 @entity10 run			1
some observers see the two politicians as subtly different flavors of the same dish , and worry that the party faithful wo n't have sufficient attention span to support two stock characters cast from such similar molds			0
some @entity0 loyalists , the @entity39 reports , have asked their friends and business associates to pull back from committing their support to @entity5 , for now , in case @entity0 takes the plunge			2
@entity0 insisted this week in @entity120 that he has n't given himself a deadline for deciding whether to enter the race .			0

the two @entity44 former governors had a sit - down on their calendars scheduled for thursday , and no one thought to cancel it
they are likely on a collision course in the @entity44 @entity10 *primary* process
potential political donors are getting phone calls from the two men just hours apart
@entity5 and @entity0 are clear polling front - runners as 2016 looms
