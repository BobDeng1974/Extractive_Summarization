the heroic story of a humble librarian who became an all - action commando and was executed after a daring mission behind enemy lines has come to light 70 years after his death			1
sergeant @entity6 was one of four commandos for the high - risk @entity8 ( @entity8 ) - a secret espionage and sabotage force - caught by the @entity12 following an attempt to block the @entity14 in the @entity15 by sinking a ship			2
the @entity17 forced the trained wireless operator to send false messages back to his @entity8 base in @entity21 , @entity22 , so they would send back information about future operations			1
but brave @entity25 inserted ' tell tale ' words into his messages so his superiors knew that he had been captured			1
sergeant @entity6 was part of the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) - a secret espionage and sabotage force known as @entity33 's @entity32 @entity25 was sent to @entity35 concentration camp when his @entity37 captors realised he was duping them by sending fake messages to his superiors ( file pic ) with this knowledge , the @entity40 sent back fake messages in order to hoodwink the @entity12 and supply them with misleading information that would have disrupted their movements of troops			1
it took two months for the enemy to realise what @entity25 was up to , at which point he was sent to @entity35 concentration camp in north - east @entity12			1
in early 1945 , just months before the end of the war , @entity25 and the three other commandos were rounded up and shot by the @entity55 @entity25 was awarded the @entity56 while he was a pow for his brave actions but because of the nature of the @entity8 , dubbed @entity33 's @entity32 , hardly anything was stated publicly about the award or what it was for			1
even his family did not know about the details until 2000 , when relatives started researching him and unearthed previously - sealed secret documents			0
an extract from the recommendation for the @entity56 reads : ' without consideration of his personal safety , he took a grave risk the whole time in deliberately hoodwinking the enemy in a manner which has in other cases resulted in the immediate shooting of the operator			0
' the medals , along with poignant telegrams sent from the @entity78 to @entity25 's parents which confirm his death , are now set to sell for £ 20,000 pounds at auction tomorrow			1
a year after the end of the war , a solider looks on as a scuttled @entity12 ship lies across the @entity14 @entity25 and three other commandos were captured when they were sent to the @entity14 , @entity89 , to attempt to blow up a ship and block the waterway a letter , sent from the @entity78 to @entity25 's family , confirms his date of death as april 10 , 1945 @entity96 , of @entity97 of @entity98 , @entity99 , said : ' it is the saddest of stories			1
what this man did and the bravery and sacrifice he made can not be understated			0
' if a soldier is killed in action then that is the nature of war but this was a crime			2
@entity25 was murdered by evil men			2
' his actions were beyond @entity114 and derring - do stuff			0
he was a true hero whose bravery has been hidden for 70 years			1
' for like many such bravery awards , it was requested that no details should be made public , nor communicated to the press - leaving @entity25 's family firmly in the dark for a lifetime			1
' they thought he was a lowly signaller and had no idea of his @entity8 activity , which was an incredibly risky organisation to be in considering @entity128 gave the infamous order that commandos should be summarily executed as spies if caught			0
' @entity25 , from @entity132 , @entity99 , worked in his local library until the outbreak of war in 1939 , when he joined the @entity136			2
he was one of the first volunteers for the @entity8 , a covert organisation that carried out espionage and sabotage missions behind enemy lines			0
along with the military medals and letter from the @entity78 , other records will be sold at auction tomorrow auctioneers estimate that the collection of fascinating artefacts will sell for around £ 20,000 in total tomorrow @entity25 underwent special training which included parachute training and is likely to have taken part in a number of secret operations before the raid on the @entity14 in 1943			2
the four - man operation , led by lieutenant commander @entity155 , involved the team landing in uniform by submarine near @entity159 , @entity89 , with over two tons of munitions and explosives			0
despite interventions by @entity165 and @entity12 forces , the team managed to deposit the mines on a ship in the canal , however the explosives failed to detonate			0
although they got away following fire - fight , the @entity12 recovered one of their radios , complete with secret code books			0
sgt @entity25 later received a radio message , almost certainly sent by the @entity12 using the captured wireless set , advising the team of a rendezvous with a @entity179 submarine			1
the meeting was a trap which finally led to the capture of the men			0
they were brutally treated during their time in captivity			0
following the war , an investigation was launched into the fate of the party and a former @entity40 inmate of the concentration camp revealed the men suffered poor health and were emaciated			1
they were last seen being transported out of the camp on april 10 , 1945 , to be shot			0
@entity25 was 30 years old at the time .			2
