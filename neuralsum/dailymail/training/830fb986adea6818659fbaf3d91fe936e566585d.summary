by @entity0 in a room in east @entity3 at 6.30am , 200 people are dancing to deep house club anthems , waving their arms about , whooping and cheering , and generally getting pretty excited			1
it 's a rave , yes , but not as you know them			0
this is not an after - party			2
these people have not dragged their weary selves from a club to an underground bunker in which to continue their slcohol - soaked merriment			1
these people are stone - cold sober , have just woken up and are about to go to work			2
welcome to the world of early morning raving			2
put your trainers on ...			0
head to @entity31 for a pre-breakfast rave before going to work the premise of the monthly event - whose subhead is ' rave your way into the day ' - is to turn clubbing on its head and allow music fiends to embrace beats and bass without alcohol , and to rev themselves up for the day through dancing			1
@entity45 @entity44 , who provided the soundtrack to the event at @entity48 as @entity25 with his @entity45 partner @entity49 , told @entity50 : ' we came straight from playing at @entity53 festival and the energy in the club was the same as it had been there			1
a lot of people were really getting their sweat on			0
' @entity44 , who also takes rave to the yoga generation when he @entity45 for outdoor yoga classes in @entity63 , added : ' most people there were about to go to work , and some of them looked a bit bewildered at first , but then everyone really started getting into the music			0
' it 's clubbing with a good , happy vibe , and none of that dark edge			2
' the view from behind the @entity45 booth at @entity20 held in east @entity3 organisers hope to make the event a weekly occurrence , and the @entity79 hope to be asked back			1
' it was free - form exercise			0
it came from the idea that people go to aerobics or the gym in the morning , and this is like that without it being structured			0
' it 's like clubbing , but instead of crawling out into the darkness afterwards feeling horrible , you go to work feeling great			0
and instead of having a beer you have coffee , a croissant and a massage			0
' the next drop - in event is scheduled for 4 september			1
is an early - morning rave exactly what you need to feel energised in the morning ?			1
