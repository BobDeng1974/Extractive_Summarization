we like to think of ourselves as the superior species			2
but robots are learning to cook like humans - by watching @entity5 videos			1
in a sign of the times , researchers have found a way to teach robots how to use cooking tools			1
their work is part of an impressive use of artificial intelligence called ' deep learning			1
' deep learning involves researchers using training systems called artificial neural networks on lots of information derived from audio , images , and other inputs			1
in order to train the robots , researchers selected data from 88 @entity5 videos of people cooking , according to @entity58			1
a ' special ' robot chef cuts noodles in a restaurant 's kitchen in @entity63 , @entity64 , the sight of a robot cooking a meal could soon become a common occurence from there , the researchers generated commands that a robot could then execute			1
the researchers employed ' convolutional neural networks ' which are now in use at @entity74 , among other companies			1
they used these networks to identify the way a hand is grasping an item , and to recognize specific objects			2
their system was also able to anticipate the action involving an object and a hand			0
according to technology experts , they presented the systems with new information and received inferences about it in response			0
the results from the study will be revealed later this month at the 29th annual conference of the @entity95			0
ultimately , researchers hope their results may signal the start of a training program which will allow robots to be able to seek their own sources of information			1
a spokesman for the researchers said : ' we believe this preliminary integrated system raises hope towards a fully intelligent robot for manipulation tasks that can automatically enrich its own knowledge resource by ' watching ' recordings from the @entity111			2
' @entity112 neural networks were introduced in a 1980 paper by @entity114			0
the design of convolutional neural networks follows the discovery of visual mechanisms in living organisms			0
in our brain , the visual cortex contains lots of cells and it is these cells which are responsible for detecting light in small , overlapping sub-regions of the visual field , called receptive fields			2
these cells act as local filters over the input space and the more complex cells have larger receptive fields			0
a convolution operator is created to mimic and perform the same function by all of these cells			0
the networks were inspired by biological processes and are widely used models for image and video recognition , being a power tool for different vision problems .			0

research was carried out by the @entity34 and @entity35
it used an impressive type of artificial intelligence called ' deep learning '
researchers selected data from 88 @entity5 videos to train the robots
