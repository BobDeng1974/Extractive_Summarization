by @entity0 published : 14:29 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 8 august 2013 more than 30 moms gathered together to breastfeed their babies as part of a ‘ @entity9 ’ protest in front of the @entity7 ticketing counter at @entity8 – @entity10 on wednesday morning			1
the protest was in reaction to the airline ’s treatment of a mom on a flight last month when she ‘ harassed ’ for breastfeeding her five - month - old child			1
while that woman wishes to remain anonymous , her friend @entity19 has taken up the cause and organized wednesday ’s protest			2
' @entity23 ' : more than 30 moms gathered together to breastfeed their babies at @entity24 on wednesday morning ‘ when @entity7 asked our friend to cover up while she was breast feeding we knew that legally she was already given that right , ’ @entity19 told @entity25 , while breastfeeding her son			1
‘ we just had to stand up for it because we knew it was wrong , ’ she , along with the other mothers , came together in support of their friend because they are very disappointed with how @entity7 has handled the situation			2
the unnamed woman , a resident of @entity38 , @entity39 , was on a flight home from @entity41 when her five month old became cranky and hungry			0
wednesday 's protest was organized by @entity19 , who identified herself as a ' dear friend ' of the mom on the flight she says she turned in her window seat and started to breast feed her child while her husband added extra protection in the middle seat			1
the problem started , she says , when a flight attendant asked her to cover her child with a blanket to not make any other passengers uncomfortable			0
they declined and felt that from that point on the attendant ‘ avoided looking at us ’ and did n’t offer them any drinks			0
the woman wrote the airline to voice her concerns that the flight attendant displayed ‘ inappropriate , harassment - style behavior			0
’ she received a reply in which the airline said that breast - feeding is allowed in flight , but ‘ because of the offense that may be taken by others within the close confines of commercial aircraft , we simply ask that breast - feeding be done with a certain discretion and a sense of modesty			0
’ @entity7 wrote to the mom and offered her a free travel voucher , but she says she just wanted to raise awareness and receive an apology this contradicts the airline ’s own manual which states : ‘ breast - feeding of infants is permitted during all phases of flight , @entity87 should not place restrictions or requirements on the mother of the infant			1
’ ‘ we believe it is reasonable that we ask the mother to cover up in an appropriate manner during the feeding and by your account it appears that you were sensitive to this need			0
’ @entity19 , who identified herself as a ' dear friend ' of the mom on the flight , posted the airline ’s letter on @entity104 and it has been shared more than 7,5000			2
the @entity7 @entity104 page has been inundated with comments from breastfeeding mothers around the world and the company has since apologized to the mom for her treatment by the ‘ well - intentioned ’ flight attendant			1
the woman was also offering a free travel voucher , but says she wanted to do was raise awareness and receive an apology			0
the letter the mom received from @entity7 was posted by @entity19 on @entity104 and has been shared more than 7,500 times since sunday			2

the protest was in support of a mom told to cover up while she breastfeed on a @entity7 flight last month
the woman refused and claims she felt harassed
protest organizer @entity19 says breastfeeding in a public place is a legal right
the airline has since apologized
