after specialist medical treatment at a clinic in @entity12 , vets deemed he was healthy enough to be rehomed in the @entity11			1
donations : he arrived in the @entity11 on december 21 after supporters raised hundreds of pounds to rescue him battle : @entity9 , who has paralysed legs and has to wear nappies , was deemed healthy enough to be rehomed by vets			1

he was then rehoused with @entity62 , an @entity31 manager with years of experience caring for sick dogs , in @entity65 , @entity66			2
the @entity19 has been on the receiving end of repeated criticism in recent years over its ‘ politically motivated ’ actions			2
the charity has pursued a number of expensive legal cases in its battle against activities such as foxhunting , leading some to suggest it has prioritised animal rights over animal welfare			0
it was heavily criticised last year after it was revealed to have spent £ 326,000 on legal action against @entity81 ’s hunt in @entity82			2
and despite the @entity19 relying solely on donations from the public , its boss @entity83 earns up to £ 160,000 a year			1
there have been calls to strip the charity – set up in 1824 – of its ability to bring prosecutions			0
yesterday the head of the @entity94 warned that the @entity19 has turned into a ‘ sinister and nasty ’ organisation			2
general sir @entity96 urged his members to stop donating to it			0
he told the @entity99 its inspectors had been given intrusive powers with no proper basis in law			0
he said : ‘ when their inspectors turn up in uniform it ’s as a private organisation			0
there is something rather sinister and nasty about it			0
‘ it ’s a sad story			0
it ’s got plenty of money but its membership has plummeted			0
’ however , on friday after just two hours at his new home , he was taken away by an officer from the @entity19			2
the officer said she would return @entity116 after some routine tests but mrs @entity62 says she received a phone call to say the dog would be put down the following day			0
the @entity19 told her a vet had decided that @entity9 was not fit enough to lead a happy life – a claim his new owner and @entity33 say is untrue			1
last night , as the @entity9 campaign gathered momentum , attracting support from around the world , the @entity19 said they would seek a second opinion from another vet before making a final decision on the dog ’s fate			1
that failed to placate @entity31 , which spent £ 510 to transport @entity9 from @entity12 and more than £ 1,300 on his treatment , including vaccinations and ct scans			1
the charity ’s founder , @entity138 , said last night that @entity9 had been deemed fit enough by @entity42 to enter the country			2
‘ that would not have been the case if he was as ill as they claim , ’ she said			0
‘ you can see in a video we took just days ago that he is a lively , active and happy boy			0
he deserves a chance to live , especially after everything he ’s gone through			0
’ action aid chairman @entity149 said : ‘ the @entity19 ’s answer to everything is to kill , rather than working with the animals to make them better			2
' this is the first time in the dog ’s life it has been given a chance for a better life and it has now been cruelly taken away			0
’ if the second vet decides @entity9 should live , @entity33 will use funds raised through the @entity9 campaign to buy a £ 200 doggie wheelchair and hydrotherapy , which costs about £ 35 per session			2
comments by signers of the petition , on website @entity168 , include claims the @entity19 is ‘ barbaric ’ , ‘ militant ’ and discriminates against disabled animals			1
the @entity19 last night denied it had taken the decision that @entity9 should be put down , saying it was on the recommendation of a vet			1
support : last night , the @entity9 campaign gathered momentum , attracting support from across the world ‘ we visited @entity9 at an address in @entity182 on friday after concerns had been raised with us about his welfare			1
we found him to be in a poor state of health and so took him to see a vet , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ as well as having disabled legs which were wrapped up in duct tape , he is incontinent , has pressure sores and possible internal injuries too			0
‘ the first vet recommended that the kindest thing to do was to put him to sleep as he has no quality of life			0
on the owner ’s request we have taken him to a specialist vet of the owner ’s choosing			0
‘ any decision about @entity9 ’s future will be made by vets and with @entity9 ’s best welfare in mind			2
’ @entity138 of @entity31 said @entity9 had only had a small amount of duct tape on his leg to hold together a bandage - as a temporary measure			1
it had been attached by the dog 's foster carer before he arrived at @entity62 ' home .			0
