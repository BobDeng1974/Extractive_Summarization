@entity0 may vote next year on changing its flag , scrubbing out the red , white and blue of the @entity3 to break its ties with @entity5			1
the country 's newly re-elected prime minister , @entity6 , made the revelation today as the country looks to assert an identity independent of its former colonial overlord			1
@entity6 's centre - right government was returned for a third three year term on saturday in a resounding win , promising to continue steady economic management and controls on spending , and possible tax cuts in three years			2
flag change ? the current flag was adopted at the start of the 20th century and features the @entity22 in the top - left corner with the four red stars of the @entity25 on a blue background asked about his promise of a referendum on a change of flag , @entity6 said he wanted it to be the subject of a referendum next year , including finding an alternative and then putting that up against the current flag			1
' i 'm obviously a big supporter of the change , i think there are a lot of strong arguments in favour of the change , ' he said on the @entity44 network			0
@entity6 has previously said he wants a flag uniquely @entity0 in character that would be recognisable around the world			1
changing history : @entity6 's centre - right government was returned for a third three year term on saturday in a resounding win			2
but @entity6 , who has backed a new flag with a silver fern on a black background , acknowledged there would be strong arguments to retain the current flag all black : @entity0 sports teams , notably the world champion @entity60 rugby team , often compete under a silver fern motif , and the national carrier @entity63 has put it on its aircraft tails compromise : people have come up with various suggestions for a new @entity0 flag over tthe years , like this by @entity70 in 2000 made as a ' compromise ' , but none have ever gained traction in 2009 , a flag was devised which incorporated both the @entity3 and @entity0 's national colours , black and white			1
the red is the colour of the @entity79 people of the country			2
eleven years earlier , something similar was designed with a silver fern ( right ) in 2005 , a red , white and blue flag was devised by @entity84 ( left )			2
the blue colour represents the ocean , the red represents the @entity79 and the blood of soldiers , and white is a reference to the ' @entity92 '			0
but some have suggested just getting rid of the @entity3 ( right ) the @entity94 ( left ) has been proposed as a secondary flag for @entity0 , designed by @entity96 in 1983			0
it has a black stripe on the left to represent the @entity79 and a green curling fern			0
then there is the @entity103 flag , the @entity79 national flag ( right ) the current flag was adopted at the start of the 20th century and features the @entity22 in the top - left corner with the four red stars of the @entity25 on a blue background			1
it is often confused with the similar looking @entity112 flag			0
@entity6 , who has backed a new flag with a silver fern on a black background , acknowledged there would be strong arguments to retain the current flag			1
the group representing returned soldiers has been a vocal opponent of change , saying the move would disrespect those who had fought and died defending it			0
@entity0 sports teams , notably the world champion @entity60 rugby team , often compete under a silver fern motif , and the national carrier @entity63 has put it on its aircraft tails			0
a survey in march showed 52 percent of respondents did not see any need to change the flag .			0

re-elected *pm* @entity6 said he wants referendum on getting a new flag
the move would signal an assertion of new identity independent of @entity5
current flag has @entity22 with four red stars of the @entity25
