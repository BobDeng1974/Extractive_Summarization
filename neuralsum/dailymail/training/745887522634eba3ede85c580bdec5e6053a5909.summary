four nuclear reactors are to be closed temporarily following a safety alert			1
the need to investigate a fault in a boiler system means that the reactors will be out of action for around eight weeks			2
two reactors at @entity8 , @entity9 , and two at @entity11 , @entity12 , will close tomorrow , according to @entity14 energy giant @entity13			1
two reactors at @entity8 , @entity9 will close tomorrow so a fault in a boiler system can be investigated , according to @entity14 energy giant @entity13 together the four units serve three million homes , supplying 10 per cent of @entity20 ’s nuclear power			1
the fault , detected in a metal support tube , was found at the @entity24 1 site in @entity25			1
the other three reactors will be closed as a precaution because they have the same design			2
the problems highlight concerns about @entity20 ’s ageing power stations – no reactors have been built since 1995			1
the power stations at @entity8 and @entity11 were built in 1983 and are set to be decommissioned in 2019			1
they were originally due to come out of service this year			0
the government is keen to kickstart a new generation of nuclear plants and last year ministers signed a deal with @entity13 and two @entity42 firms to start building a plant in @entity44 in @entity45			2
the power stations at @entity8 and @entity11 ( pictured ) were built in 1983 and are set to be decommissioned in 2019 but the project is on hold while the @entity48 decides whether the contract meets competition rules			1
the £ 16billion project will be funded by levies on household power bills for 35 years			0
the firms will receive a guaranteed price for the electricity they supply			0
officials in @entity58 are investigating whether the deal is overly generous to the firms			0
meanwhile , @entity13 has been seeking extensions to the life of its existing plants , most of which are scheduled to close by the end of 2023			0
its other plants are at @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 in @entity73 , and @entity74 in @entity75			0
@entity13 first found the fault at @entity8 last year			1
the boiler was returned to service early this year on a reduced load , but in june a defect was found and @entity24 1 was shut down			1
@entity13 has been seeking extensions to the life of its existing plants , including @entity72 in @entity73 , most of which are scheduled to close by the end of 2023 the firm said : ‘ until the results of the further inspections are known it is not possible to advise exact return to service dates for these four reactors , however an initial estimate is that these investigations will take around eight weeks			2
@entity13 ’s other nuclear power stations are not affected by this issue as they are of a different design			1
’ @entity96 , which runs the @entity20 power network , said there was plenty of surplus capacity during the summer months			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we have many generation sources to call on and demand is low at this time of the year			0
’ but if the problems continue into the winter , it may well create a problem as demand increases			0
the @entity110 said : ‘ onr is satisfied that @entity13 is taking appropriate and conservative action in the interests of continued nuclear safety , and that they are seeking to obtain positive confirmation of the condition of the boilers			0
‘ there has been no release of radioactive material and no persons have been injured			0
’ the @entity110 said the cracking at the @entity24 1 site was in the ‘ boiler spine ’ , the metal tube which supports the weight of boiler tubes coiled around it			1
it added : ‘ its failure could lead to water entering the reactor vessel			0
‘ the shutdowns will allow the company to undertake accelerated inspections of all of the boilers in each of the reactors which are a similar design , and to fit equipment that will enable monitoring of the condition of the boiler spines			0
’ @entity141 , the owner of @entity141 , which has a 20 per cent stake in @entity13 ’s nuclear operations , said the reduction in output would reduce the company ’s 2014 earnings			2
nuclear power contributes one - sixth of the country ’s electricity .			1

reactors at @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity11 , @entity12 will close
the four units supply a total of 10 per cent of @entity20 *'s* nuclear power
