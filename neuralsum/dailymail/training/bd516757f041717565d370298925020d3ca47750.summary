thousands of years before the advent of cds , ancient people were using disks to store information			0
now , one expert has described the @entity6 – a mysterious circular clay tablet with a spiral inscription – as the ‘ first @entity10 cd - rom ' , because of the way the pictorial markings are laid out			1
he claims the disk features a prayer to mother , which is recorded using an ancient language made up of signs , including what looks like a plumed head , a child and even a beehive			1
it measures 6 inches ( 15cm ) in diameter and is covered on both sides in a spiral of stamped signs			0
since it was found , experts have been trying to decipher the mysterious inscriptions and have come up with a number of interpretations			1
it is very hard to come up with a definitive reading of the disk , because it is made up of just 241 pictures , or ' tokens ' on both its sides based on 45 individual signs			1
most experts believe that the inscription should be read from the outside edge of the disk , inwards			1
dr @entity55 claims the disk features a prayer to mother , which is recorded using an obscure ancient language made up of signs , including what looks like a plumed head , a child and even a beehive			1
he worked this out by picking out a reoccurring keyword ( pictured ) which he used as a basis for his translation the @entity6 is a disk made of fired clay that was found in the @entity10 palace of @entity6 on @entity31			1
it is thought to date to the middle @entity28 in the second millennium @entity29 , but precise estimates vary			0
the disk measures 6 inches ( 15cm ) in diameter and is covered on both sides in a spiral of stamped signs			2
its purpose and meaning is disputed , and now one expert claims it is an ancient prayer to a mother			1
the disk was discovered in 1908 and features 241 ' tokens ' made up of 45 unique signs laid out in a spiralling clockwise sequence			1
many of these 45 signs represent easily identifiable every - day things			2
in addition to these , there is a small diagonal line that occurs underneath the final sign in a group a total of 18 times			0
the disc shows traces of corrections made by the scribe in several places			0
dr @entity55 of the @entity103 ( @entity104 ) of @entity31 believes the disk is dedicated to a mother , @entity102 reported			1
‘ the most stable word and value is “ mother ” and in particular the mother goddess of the @entity10 era , ’ he said in a public talk at the institute			0
he looked at groupings of signs found on three of parts of one side of the disk to come up with this theory			2
they spell out @entity123 - @entity122 and he said that i - @entity123 means ‘ great lady of importance ’			2
on the other side of the double - sided disk , he identified the word @entity130 , which he says means ‘ pregnant mother ’			2
therefore , he thinks that one side is dedicated to a pregnant woman and the other to a woman giving birth			0
speaking in a @entity138 talk in may , he explained how he worked with @entity139 at @entity140 for six years to crack the code			0
‘ it ’s the closest thing to a partial @entity10 @entity146 , ’ he said , stating that they can now read 90 per cent of ‘ @entity143 ’ of the disk			0
their next challenge is to work out exactly what the signs means , but dr @entity151 is sure it is a ‘ genuine @entity10 religious inscription ’			0
he light - heartedly likened the ancient disk to a cd - rom because it stores information			1
‘ it could stand for @entity158 , ’ he quipped			0
the disk is so important because it is from @entity161 – the first literate civilisation in @entity162			0
the disk is thought to date to the middle @entity28 , in the second @entity29 and was discovered in 1900 at the palace of @entity165 ( pictured ) , in the north eastern @entity31			2

ancient clay disk found in @entity31 ' stores ' a prayer to a mother
experts have been trying to read the pictorial signs for a century and this is the latest interpretation of the mysterious disk
@entity6 is made up of 241 ' tokens ' made up of 45 unique signs
dr @entity55 of the @entity103 ( @entity104 ) of @entity31 has identified keywords such as ' mother ' and ' woman of great importance '
the next step is to *unravel* the specific meaning and ancient use for the disk
