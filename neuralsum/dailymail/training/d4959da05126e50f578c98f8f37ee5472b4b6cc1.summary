by @entity0 published : 03:27 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 09:25 est , 31 may 2013 an amateur explorer from @entity3 has begun a 60 - day mission living on a remote island off the coast of @entity7 stuck inside a converted eight - foot water tank			1
@entity9 is hoping to set two endurance records by living on the 100ft island of @entity12 and raise £ 10,000 for the @entity14 charity			1
but as he started his mission , he admitted his wife @entity16 told him she and their 18 - month - old son , @entity17 , did n't want him to go			0
@entity12 is situated 225 miles west of the @entity20 chain and is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of @entity22 swell			1
@entity9 , a 38 - year - old chartered surveyor from @entity3 sets off on his 60 - day mission to live on the remote @entity7 islet of @entity12 inside the yellow , eight - foot converted water tank @entity9 used a diesel - powered winch to lift his homemade ' rockpod ' on to the @entity30 cruise boat			1
the journey to the @entity7 islet of @entity12 - 225 miles west from the @entity20 - took 12 hours			1
the eight - foot converted water bowser was fitted with hatches and fixing points so @entity9 can fix it island 's rocks explorer @entity9 will be taking nearly half a tonne of equipment with him during his 60 - day stint on the islet of @entity12 , including : 60 days ' food fishing kit and bait pants and socks x 10 comfy shoes insect collection kit @entity51 for news weather station @entity54 whisky and cask emergency water maker lip balm binoculars @entity60 rolls ( average of one per week ) ear plugs harmonicas and lesson book flags sunglasses satellite phone laptop the world 's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - 19 feet higher than @entity12 itself			1
because @entity12 is so remote only four people have ever slept on it and less than 100 people have ever landed on it			1
but mr @entity9 , 38 , a chartered surveyor , created a yellow living pod from an eight - foot water tank , and made it cosy with spray - on insulation foam in a bid to spend 60 days on @entity12			1
he recently won £ 3,500 from the @entity80 - following a presentation at the @entity81 in @entity82 - to help his bid			0
the current record for time spent on @entity12 is 40 days , back in 1985 - when ex-sas soldier @entity86 lived on the rock from 26 may to 4 july - to affirm @entity89 's claim to the islet			1
mr @entity9 , who previously stayed for a shorter expedition on the islet , hopes to break the record on the rock to raise money for @entity14			1
@entity9 said from his home town of @entity96 on thursday : ' decision made - we 're going for @entity12 today			1
he plans to spend 60 days on the island inside this eight foot water tank that he converted ' i am ready for what lies ahead - both mentally and physically , but it is more a mental challenge			1
' i am as prepared as i can be			0
i have enough rations and i am looking forward to it and setting new records for @entity12			2
yet mr @entity9 is n't planning to make a habit of these adventures : ' it may be the last ! who knows ? i 'm just concentrating on this one for now			2
landing on it is tricky			0
' the journey to the islet takes around 12 - hours and mr @entity9 , a climber and marathon runner , was ferried over there aboard a boat from local operator @entity116			1
@entity9 will live on the isolated 100ft island of @entity12 inside an eight foot water tank that he has converted to be inhabitable @entity9 used a diesel - powered winch to lift the ' rockpod ' onto the boat , he will then bolt it onto the islet to secure it in place			1
' it 's a converted water bowser which has been fitted with hatches and fixing points so i can fix it to the rock			2
' i have a daily routine of exercises and safety checks , and i 'm also going to be carrying out some sample collections for @entity133 and the @entity134			0
@entity9 admitted he did not want to be ' stuck ' inside his survival pod too much but the weather may force him to			2
he can only walk a few feet outside of the narrow ledge his home will be on			0
the isolated island of @entity12 in the @entity20 is a 100ft wide and can attract waves of up to 95 feet high @entity12 is a formidable opponent for any adventurer , located 225 miles west of the @entity20 and surrounded by choppy water ' i will exercise and i am taking an exercise band for resistance training , ' said mr @entity9			1
' i will also have a lot of ebooks on my laptop to read			0
' i feel confident that i am ready for this amazing adventure			0
' the majority of @entity9 's equipment and supplies were packed into plastic drums and were donated by @entity153 of @entity154			2
before the trip , @entity9 said : ' i fully expect that i will have to repack several times to ensure i know where everything is , but otherwise i feel confident that i will be ready in a month 's time for this amazing adventure			2
' the expedition is being sponsored by @entity161 which also provided a stove and the @entity163 needed to cook			0
@entity9 was ferried to the remote @entity7 islet during a 12 - hour journey aboard a boat from local operator @entity116			1
he is leaving his wife @entity16 and 18 - month - old son , @entity17 , for two months to raise £ 10,000 for @entity169			0
@entity9 plans to spend the time learning harmonica and said he hoped to become ' as good as @entity172 ' - the late @entity174 master , who collaborated with @entity175 and @entity176 - when he leaves @entity12			1
' at least i wo n't drive anybody else crazy with my playing , ' he said			0
mr @entity9 want to set both the longest solo occupation of @entity12 and the longest occupation in its history			1
' i will be surviving off less than 2500 calories a day and consuming military - style boil - in - the - bag rations			0
' i am looking forward to it and i am not nervous			0
i have done all the preparations i can			0
' in 2011 tv adventurer @entity186 said he wanted to lead an exhibition to ' reclaim ' @entity12 for @entity89			2
' i once tried to invade @entity12 , unsuccessfully , and have first - hand experience of the ridiculousness of @entity12 's size and the recklessness of attempting a landing			1
it is a realm of the sea , a kingdom governed only by the weather , ' he said			0
the majority of @entity9 's equipment and supplies were packed into plastic drums and were donated by @entity153 of @entity154			2
@entity9 plans to spend the time learning harmonica and said he hoped to become ' as good as @entity172 ' - the late @entity174 master , who collaborated with @entity175 and @entity176 - when he leaves @entity12 ' @entity9 's attempt to not only land , but stay for 60 days and raise money for a very worthy charity is an apt gesture for an island so immersed in eccentricity			1
' survival expert @entity213 added that it was ' an ambitious , exciting - and wonderfully mad - project , but in aid of a life - changing charity that needs our help			2
' @entity220 radio enthusiasts landed on the remote @entity22 islet - @entity89 's loneliest outpost - in october 2011 and transmitted for more than 15 hours			0
the island is the core of an eroded volcano that erupted around 55 million years ago			0
the rock is 100ft wide and 70ft high and in the past @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 have lain claim to @entity12 and to the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it			1
even tv adventurer @entity186 failed to land @entity12 and he has praised mr @entity9 for the attempt ownership is now being examined by the @entity237 in the light of competing claims from @entity227 , the @entity240 and @entity226			1
the earliest recorded landing on @entity12 was believed to be in 1810 , by an officer called @entity243 from the @entity244			2
in 2011 an adventurer dramatically cancelled his attempt to land on @entity12 to reaffirm the @entity89 's ownership of it - after half his team suddenly quit two days into the expedition			1
@entity250 wanted to put a new plaque on @entity12 to replace the one that was left in 1955 in what was the last territorial expansion of the @entity254			2
@entity255 mr @entity250 also had to cancel a bid in 2010 to reach @entity12 after there was a hold - up in getting the islet 's first planning permission from the @entity261 - the nearest local authority			1
the @entity263 annexed @entity12 in 1955 and the @entity264 declared it part of the @entity20			2
its exact position was first charted by @entity263 surveyor captain @entity267 in 1831			0
but it was on september 18 , 1955 , that the island was officially annexed by the @entity270 when three marines - lieutenant - commander @entity272 , sergeant @entity273 and corporal @entity274 - and civilian naturalist @entity275 were deposited on the island by a @entity263 helicopter			0
the team cemented in a brass plaque on @entity280 and hoisted the @entity281 to stake the @entity89 's claim			0
during his reconnaissance trip last june , mr @entity9 did unfurl a @entity281 and tweeted on @entity284 : ' @entity285 ' but did , however , lose some equipment during his brief stay			0
the occupiable area of @entity12 , named in 1955 as @entity280 after the first recorded person to land there , is just 11 feet x 4 feet , and is just 13 feet below the summit			0
there are no trees or bushes on the rock - just algae , seaweeds and one black lichen			0
just over 20 species of sea bird and only six species of animal have been recorded on or near @entity12 .			0
