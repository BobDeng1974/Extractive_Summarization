by @entity0 learning to read @entity1 - the tactile writing system used by people who are blind and visually impaired - is notoriously difficult			1
to make this a little easier , researchers have designed vibrating gloves that help people learn to read and write @entity1 with minimal effort			1
vibrating motors at the knuckle of each finger in the gloves buzz to tell a wearer to press a corresponding key , and the system tells them which letter they are typing			1
life could get a little easier for visually impaired people as scientists from @entity21 have created vibrating gloves ( pictured ) which have help them learn to read @entity1 more easily			1
the process is based on a technique known as passive haptic learning , and means wearers can learn @entity1 even if they 're not paying full attention and the gloves even teach the wearer when they are not paying attention			1
‘ the process is based on passive haptic learning ( @entity37 ) , ’ said @entity31 , a @entity21 professor who is also the technical lead on @entity34 ’s @entity33			1
‘ we ’ve learned that people can acquire motor skills through vibrations without devoting active attention to their hands			0
’ professor @entity31 and phd student @entity44 put the gloves to the test to examine how well this technique can be used to teach @entity1			2
each participant wore a pair of gloves with tiny vibrating motors stitched into the knuckles			2
the motors vibrated in a sequence that corresponded with the typing pattern of a pre-determined phrase in @entity1 , while audio cues let the users know the @entity1 letters produced by typing that sequence			2
nearly 40 million people worldwide are blind , but because @entity1 ( stock image pictured ) lessons are widely neglected in schools , only 10 per cent of those who are blind learn the language scientists at @entity21 stitched tiny vibrating motors into the knuckles of each finger in the gloves			1
when one of the motors vibrates , the wearer presses a corresponding key and the system tells them which letter they are typing			1
the gloves were tested on people who had never learned @entity1 before			2
after an initial lesson , participants were distracted for 30 minutes by playing a game and half of the participants ' gloves kept buzzing so they kept learning passively			1
this technique is called passive haptic learning			1
people wearing the gloves that kept buzzing made 30 per cent less errors than those who did not benefit from the passive haptic training			1
they could read 70 per cent of a @entity1 phrase when tested , compared to those whose training stopped during the game , who could only read 22 per cent			1
after the lesson , the participants tried to type the phrase without the cues or vibrations on a keyboard			0
the sequences were then repeated during a distraction task , when participants played a game for 30 minutes			2
half of the participants felt repeated vibrations and heard the cues , while the others only heard the audio cues			0
when the game was over , participants tried to type the phrase without wearing the gloves			0
‘ those in the control group ( without the repeated lesson from the gloves ) did about the same on their second attempt as they did in their pre-study baseline test , ’ said professor @entity31			0
‘ but participants who felt the vibrations during the game were a third more accurate			0
’ the researchers expected to see a wide disparity between the two groups , but they were surprised the passive learners picked up an additional skill			0
‘ remarkably , we found that people could transfer knowledge learned from typing @entity1 to reading @entity1 , ’ said @entity44			2
wearers of the buzzing gloves could read 70 per cent of a @entity1 phrase when tested and others were typing perfectly after four hours of lessons			1

the technology has previously been used to teach beginners how to play simple piano melodies in just 45 minutes passive @entity138 ( @entity37 ) allows people to learn ' muscle memory ' through vibrations without devoting attention to the stimulus			1
@entity37 can be used by wearable computers such as gloves with an embedded tactile interface			2
two years ago , @entity21 scientists used vibrating gloves to teach people how to play the piano while learning everyday tasks - an example of @entity37			1
in the ' mobile music touch ' glove set - up , users wore the vibrating gloves to learn a tune			0
the song being learned was loaded onto a user ’s mobile phone and was played as they went about their business			0
as each note was played , the glove tapped the finger corresponding to the appropriate key on a piano keyboard			0
in as little as 30 minutes , users of the gloves and the @entity37 technique learned the ' muscle memory ' of the first phrases of the song , even though their attention was devoted to another task			1
‘ after the typing test , passive learners were able to read and recognise more than 70 percent of the phrase ’s letters			2
’ no - one in the study had previously typed on a @entity1 keyboard or knew the language			0
the study also did n’t include screens or visual feedback , so participants never saw what they typed			0
they had no indication of their accuracy throughout the study			0
‘ the only learning they received was guided by the haptic interface , ’ she said			0
@entity44 said that six out of eight participants who have tried to learn the full @entity1 alphabet during four one - hour lessons since , have achieved perfect typing using the gloves			1
participants can also recognise and read more than 90 per cent of all the letters in the alphabet after just four hours			0
nearly 40 million people worldwide are blind , but because @entity1 lessons are widely neglected in schools , only 10 per cent of those who are blind learn the language			2
the @entity1 studies will be presented in @entity207 this september at the 18th @entity208 ( @entity208 )			0
scientists at the university have previously used the glove to teach beginners how to play simple piano melodies in just 45 minutes .			0

@entity21 scientist created the gloves fitted with motors in the knuckles
the gloves buzz to tell wearers to press a corresponding key , and the system tells them which letter they are typing
process is based on a technique known as passive haptic learning ( @entity37 )
this means wearers learn @entity1 even if they 're not paying full attention
in tests , wearers could read 70 per cent of a @entity1 phrase after 30 minutes
while others were typing perfectly after just four hours of lessons
