by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 17 october 2013 the earliest known complete nervous system preserved in the fossilised remains of a creature that crawled and swam in the ocean 520 million years ago has been discovered			1
scientists believe it shows the moment the ancestors of spiders and scorpions evolved from other insects and demonstrates how spiders ' biting mouth parts evolved from its ancestor 's appendages			1
the creature is an ancestor of chelicerates which branched off from the family tree of other arthropods , including insects , crustaceans and millipedes			1
this is a close - up of the head region of the @entity27 fossil specimen with the superimposed colours of a microscopy technique revealing the distribution of chemical elements in the fossil			2
copper shows up as blue , iron as magenta and the ct scans as green			2
the coincidence of iron and @entity39 denote nervous system chelicerates include horsehoe crabs , scorpions , spiders , mites and ticks			1
they originated as marine animals in the cambrian period and surviving species include four species of horsehoe crabs			0
there are over 77,000 modern species of air - breathing chelicerates , but there could be as many as 500,000 unidentified species			2
like all arthropods , chelicerates have segmented bodies with jointed limbs , all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins			1
the chelicerae , which give the group its name , are the only appendages that appear before the mouth			0
in most sub-groups , they are modest pincers used to feed but spiders ' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey			2
chelicerates were originally predators , but the group has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies			2
the fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans - @entity82 for large claws - and solves the long - standing mystery of where this group fits in the tree of life			1
professor @entity89 in the @entity91 's department of neuroscience said : ' we now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today 's horseshoe crabs and scorpions			1
' this means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the @entity105			1
' working together with @entity108 's @entity107 , the scientists identified the 3cm long creature unearthed from the famous @entity111 formation near @entity112 in southwest @entity113 , as a representative of the extinct genus @entity27			1
animals in this group had an elongated , segmented body equipped with about a dozen pairs of body appendages enabling them to swim and crawl , according to the study , published in @entity123			0
they all featured a pair of long , scissor - like appendages attached to the head , most likely for grasping or sensory purposes , which gave them their collective name , megacheirans			0
this is an illustration of the nervous systems of the @entity27 fossil ( left ) , a larval horseshoe crab ( middle ) and a scorpion ( right )			2
diagnostic features revealing the evolutionary relationships among these animals include the forward position of the gut opening in the brain and the arrangement of optic centres outside and inside the brain supplied by two pairs of eyes @entity149 , of @entity108 's @entity107 , said some palaeontologists had used the external appearance of the great appendage to infer that the megacheirans were related to chelicerates			0
this was based on the fact that the great appendage and the fangs of a spider or scorpion both have an ' elbow joint ' between their basal part and their pincer - like tip. ' however , this was n't rock solid because others lined up the great appendage either a segment in front of spider fangs or one segment behind them , ' he said			0
' we have now managed to add direct evidence from which segment the brain sends nerves into the great appendage			0
' it 's the second one , the same as in the fangs , or chelicerae			0
for the first time we can analyse how the segments of these fossil arthropods line up with each other the same way as we do with living species - using their nervous systems			1
' the team analysed the fossil by applying different imaging and image processing techniques , taking advantage of iron deposits that had selectively accumulated in the nervous system during fossilisation			0
the fossil shows the typical hallmarks of the brains found in scorpions and spiders - three clusters of nerve cells known as ganglia fused together as a brain also fused with some of the animal 's body ganglia			1
professor @entity89 in the @entity91 's department of neuroscience said : ' we now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today 's horseshoe crabs ( pictured ) and scorpions ' this differs from crustaceans where ganglia are further apart and connected by long nerves , like the rungs of a rope ladder			1
other diagnostic features include the forward position of the gut opening in the brain and the arrangement of optic centres outside and inside the brain supplied by two pairs of eyes , just like in horseshoe crabs			0
professor @entity89 said : ' @entity149 plugged these characteristics into a computer - based cladistic analysis to ask , " where does this fossil appear in a relational tree ? " ' our fossil of @entity27 came out with the modern chelicerates			1
based on their location , we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages			2
' less than a year ago , the same research team published the discovery of a fossilised brain in the 520 million year - old fossil @entity245 , showing unexpected similarity to the complex brain of a modern crustacean			0
' our new find is exciting because it shows that mandibulates - to which crustaceans belong - and chelicerates were already present as two distinct evolutionary trajectories 520 million years ago , which means their common ancestor must have existed much deeper in time , ' professor @entity89 said			1
' we expect to find fossils of animals that have persisted from more ancient times and i 'm hopeful we will one day find the ancestral type of both the mandibulate and chelicerate nervous system ground patterns			0
they had to come from somewhere			0
now the search is on			0

the fossil , discovered in @entity113 , shows the moment the ancestors of spiders and scorpions evolved from other insects
the creature is an ancestor of chelicerates which branched off from the family tree of other arthropods , including insects and crustaceans
professor @entity89 in the @entity91 said the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans
