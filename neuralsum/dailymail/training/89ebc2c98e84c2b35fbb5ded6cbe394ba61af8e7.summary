by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 19:25 est , 17 june 2013 feathered friend : the @entity2 circa 1935 , with @entity3 the macaw perched on his shoulder at a garden party at @entity7 he was one of the richest peers of the realm , a multi-millionaire with such a stash of inherited wealth he never needed to think about working			1
but @entity13 , @entity14 , was more than your average spoilt aristocrat — he was one of the most riotously outrageous and toxic eccentrics ever to emerge from the @entity19 upper classes			1
he studied for the priesthood , but practised black magic and befriended sinister occultist @entity22			1
even though he married an @entity19 actress and a @entity25 princess , he was a promiscuous homosexual			1
he wrote poetry and dressed like @entity27 , yet he was so juvenile that he trained his parrot @entity3 to climb the inside of his trouser - leg and pop its head out of his flies			1
the bizarre viscount even ran a homing - pigeon scheme for military intelligence during @entity36 , but was court - martialled for revealing its secrets to two @entity40			1
and all around him , as he made his wayward path through life , friends had the mysterious habit of dying			1
‘ his friendship was a kind of curse , ’ says @entity45 , author of a new biography of the @entity48 peer			1
@entity52 became a figure of horrified fascination to @entity55 in the @entity56 and @entity57 as he pursued his twin lusts — higher learning and sex			1
what else would you expect from a man whose mother believed herself to be a kingfisher and built bird ’s nests big enough to sit in ? the dystopian world that @entity70 , 2nd @entity14 , built for himself was only made possible by colossal wealth			1
when he came of age , the vast @entity48 estate his family had owned since the 14th century was bringing in the equivalent of £ 65,000 a day — or £ 24 million a year			1
early life : @entity78 pictured with his father , the then @entity14 , when he was a 2nd lieutenant in the @entity80 home was @entity7 , a ghostly , depressingly ugly pile near @entity84 in @entity85			1
@entity13 ’s father had made himself useful during the @entity87 by handing over his private yacht to the @entity89 — on condition that he was appointed its captain			1
money rather than service bought the gold braid with which he festooned himself — so while he was still a schoolboy , @entity13 learned that a title , and colossal wealth , could get you anything you wanted			1
at @entity99 , he forged the friendships that were to shape his screwball life			1
his best friend @entity102 , a cousin of @entity103 , spent part of his childhood in @entity106 and claimed to have sold sexual favours to men in return for pocket - money			2
@entity116 still at @entity99 the pair became pageboys to the royal court at @entity120 at a time when , author @entity45 claims , ‘ mothers of vulnerable sons were known to insist their cherished boys steer well clear of the well - known paedophiles at court ’			2
but it was too late — both boys had already acquired a preference for their own sex , and before long @entity13 was kicked out of @entity99 under the inevitable cloud			2
it further counted against him that while at school he had created a circle of black - magic enthusiasts			2
inspired by @entity102 ’s tales from @entity106 of temples , casbahs , souks and arcades where magicians and tricksters plied their trade , the boys dabbled in rites and rituals which were to become a central part of @entity13 ’s life			1
with no need to work , @entity13 settled on becoming a poet			2
the first timer : despite never hiding his homosexuality and having a constant string of illicit affairs , @entity14 married @entity151 in 1928 moving in the arty circle centred on the @entity153 in @entity154 , he became friends with the painter @entity156 and the writer @entity157 , a dandy with red - lacquered fingernails			1
during this period @entity13 developed a taste for partying and buying sex from working - class rent boys			2
the viscount was no looker — @entity164 described him as ‘ a little red absurdity with a beak of a nose , no chin , and with the general likeness of a callow but student bantam cock that has run to seed ’			2
and in the helter - skelter world of @entity173 after @entity87 , filled with flappers and cocktails and drug addicts , @entity13 was constantly in search of newer , darker , sensations			2
he was fatally attracted to dangerous people			2
the occultist @entity22 was known to society as ‘ the wickedest man in the world ’ and in the @entity56 people were genuinely terrified by the mention of his name — a byword for all that was mad , bad and dangerous to know			2
born the son of a brewer in @entity188 , @entity22 , who called himself ‘ @entity190 ’ , had built up a terrifying reputation as a disciple of the @entity193			2
his stated purpose was to destroy the country ’s religious and spiritual equilibrium			2
number two : princess @entity199 became @entity201 's second wife little wonder then that the vicious @entity2 , with his schoolboy dabblings in the occult , should hasten to @entity22 ’s side — the pair met for the first time in @entity208			2
later @entity22 went to stay at @entity7 where @entity13 proudly revealed his @entity210 room — ‘ far greater than i thought ! ’ marvelled @entity22			2
despite his ostentatiously weird life — in his garden he kept a boxing kangaroo , a honey bear and a baboon , while in his bed he kept rabbits — @entity78 was still considered by ambitious mothers to be one of the country ’s most eligible bachelors			1
only when girls got close to him did they realise how completely impossible life at @entity7 would be			1
however , @entity151 , daughter of the land - rich lord @entity225 , was not so choosy			0
she had some of the same madness that infected @entity52 and a whole swathe of the post-war @entity229			0
@entity230 , nervy , self - centred and eccentric , she was also pretty , sexy and willing to overlook @entity13 ’s @entity231 married when she was 28 and he 35			0
but it was doomed from the start			0
@entity151 had already developed an addiction to drugs which would kill her before long			0
when they married in @entity237 , the crowds had to be held back by police , but the high - society union between @entity151 and @entity13 was not what it seemed			0
each agreed the other could sleep with whom they pleased as long as it did n’t interfere with their life together			1
but @entity13 ’s relentless all - male promiscuity and his love of rent boys soon rattled @entity151 , and before long they parted			0
later he married the shapely princess @entity199 , a refugee scarred by her escape from the @entity250 , but otherwise an innocent abroad			0
the marriage was annulled , unsurprisingly , on the grounds of his non-consummation after three years			0
@entity13 showed far greater devotion to his menagerie at @entity256 than he did to either of his wives			0
easy life : lord @entity14 , pictured at @entity259 near @entity84 with writer @entity260 , could live comfortably off his estate which brought in £ 24million per year birds were a big part of his life			1
his @entity266 parrot , though described by @entity13 as ‘ witless and uncontrollable ’ , was nothing of the sort			0
after teaching it the trick of crawling up the inside of his trouser leg and poking its head out of his flies , the @entity2 promptly walked into the @entity274 and performed the routine in front of a packed house			0
one of the onlookers recorded that ‘ the effect on old ladies present can be imagined ’			0
periodically , @entity13 would decide that he must do something serious with his life			1
when war was declared in 1939 , he managed to get himself taken on by @entity283 , the secret service department detailed to handle carrier pigeons bringing back messages from frontline troops in @entity287			0
so unused was he to the discipline which goes with military work , that he let two @entity40 look at the map used to plan the 1942 @entity292 attack on @entity293 — which , coincidentally , turned out to be one of the war ’s greatest military disasters			0
such was the horror of superior officers when they learned that he had divulged highly secret troop deployment details — even though it was only to a couple of teenage girls — that @entity14 was court - martialled			1
story of a life : @entity78 , 2nd @entity14 , died in april 1949 , aged 55 , survived by his beloved parrot he was found guilty and banished to an honorary post in the @entity307 , but even that small responsibility proved too much for him			1
hopeless in war , the @entity2 remained equally rudderless in peace			0
throughout his life the ostensibly high - minded @entity13 described himself as a poet , modelling himself on @entity27 and even dressing as the romantic poet , but he failed to attract the praise of any but the most sycophantic critics			1
@entity317 though he was , @entity13 could not buy literary success — and rich though he remained , he could no longer buy friendship in the way he once had			0
indeed , his friendship was something of a curse			0
those who were close to @entity13 seemed to die in their droves — often tragically young			0
@entity327 was @entity328 , a fellow royal pageboy , who died aged 27			0
then @entity157 died of lung cancer at the age of 40			0
he was followed by fellow - drinker sir @entity331 , who succumbed to alcohol poisoning at 26			0
one of @entity334 ’s lovers , the @entity335 , keeled over from tuberculosis brought on by a dissipated life , while another lover , the @entity338 , was killed in a house fire			1
friends @entity341 , a wealthy art patron , and sir @entity343 both drowned in their baths			0
and another friend , the artist @entity345 , plunged out of a window , impaling herself on the railings 40ft beneath			0
there were suicides , too : the artist @entity354 , the composer @entity351 , fellow @entity352 @entity351 and writer @entity353			0
even his first wife ’s brother , the @entity355 , killed himself			0
his sister @entity357 succumbed to drug abuse and her body was found washed up on the @entity361 shore in 1924			0
and so the party — that gay , abandoned , reckless party of parrots , poetry and promiscuity — eventually ended			0
@entity78 , whose riches so completely detached him from life , finally parted company with it on april 27 , 1949 — a victim to cancer at the early age of 55			1
the trouser - climbing parrot survived him			0
not behind @entity377 — the @entity378 , @entity14 , by @entity45 ( @entity379 , £ 12 ) , is available on @entity380 .			1
