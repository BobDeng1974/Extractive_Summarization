by @entity0 last updated at 10:47 pm on 6th february 2012 pigs at one of @entity4 's pork suppliers are being cruelly mistreated , according to animal - rights campaigners			2
an undercover video filmed by the @entity7 appears to show pigs in cages so small they can barely move			1
the pigs are recorded squealing loudly , and several of them are bleeding or displaying other injuries			0
one particularly graphic moment comes when a newborn piglet has his tail and testicles cut off , apparently without any anaesthetic			0
in papers filed with the @entity41 , the charity claimed that @entity24 was ' misleading stakeholders through unlawful statements and omissions about @entity24 ' animal welfare practices '			1
a @entity32 spokesman condemned the company 's use of gestation crates , narrow cages which do not allow animals to turn around , calling the practice ' out of step with mainstream @entity31 values about the proper treatment of animals '			2
sows are kept in gestation crates when they are pregnant - which in many cases means spending nearly their whole lives in the cages			0
large scale : there are believed to be 2,700 caged sows at the @entity25 facility castration : piglets routinely have their tails and testicles removed - apparently , often without anaesthetic but @entity24 has defended its treatment of its animals , claiming in a statement that the company is determined to ' provide the most humane treatment for our animals			2
' the statement also said : ' we are proud of our employees for exemplifying best practices in their day - to - day work and truly being leaders within the industry			1
' the company claims that the use of stalls to house livestock is not necessarily less humane than housing them in group stalls , and points out that tail docking and castration are recommended by vets			0
a spokesman for @entity4 told the @entity95 that the retail giant was co-operating with @entity24 in a review of the situation			2
she said that @entity24 ' supply a very small percentage overall of pork products ' to @entity4 as one of around 100 pork suppliers			1
cuts : several of the animals in the @entity32 's undercover video appear to be injured however , the @entity32 claims there is a disconnect between the companies ' public statements and the standards they apply in practice , including to the 2,700 sows at the @entity25 facility			1
@entity115 , president and ceo of the organisation , said ' our findings are in stark contrast to claims @entity24 makes about animal welfare '			1
according to the @entity32 , @entity24 's advisor on animal welfare has told the company : i feel very strongly that we 've got to treat animals right , and the gestation stalls have got to go			1
' confining an animal for most of its life in a box in which it is not able to turn around does not provide a decent life			0
' this is not the first time @entity4 has faced criticism relating to its sale of pork			0
in october , the firm was forced to close several stores in @entity142 after pork was allegedly mislabelled as organic			0
watch the video ( warning : graphic content )			0

the @entity32 made an undercover video at @entity24
organisation is taking legal action against the pork *vendor*
but @entity24 says it is ' proud of exemplifying best practices '
