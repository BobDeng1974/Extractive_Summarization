by @entity0 higher education reminds many of gruelling hours in the library , re-heating @entity3 and grubby student pubs			0
additional culinary adventures are determined by what can be found in the supermarket ’s reduced section rather than by what you fancy for dinner			0
however , the students at @entity13 are having a rather different experience			2
studying hard : a student relaxes in a hammock on the @entity18 - style campus of @entity13 in @entity19 which boasts a cinema , a first - class restaurant and an arcade tough times : when exam pressure gets too tough on @entity27 students , they can relax by the swimming pool			1
or in the cinema university utopia : the college experience at @entity27 is worlds away compared to what most university students enjoy during their years in higher education the campus , located in @entity27 , @entity19 , has more resemblance to a theme park than a traditional university , and boasts amenities you are more likely to find at a high - end hotel than at a school			1
aside from the jaw - dropping buildings , a result of more than $ 700million worth of refurbishing , the campus also has swimming pools , top - end sports facilities and a first - class restaurant where students can enjoy one free five - course meal per week			1
the cinema , which shows features straight out of the high - street movie theatres , does not only screen for free , but also offer students complimentary popcorn , sweets and soft drinks			1
should students be so inclined , there is an arcade , a putting green , a sports bar and even an ice cream truck - all of this for no monies			1
@entity27 's ' @entity68 ' - a $ 19million fraternity and sorority complex , ensures that hard - working students can relax in outdoor hot tubs			2
however , when that is not enough to combat exam stress , @entity27 brings in masseuses and puppy therapy			0
shine on : the campus has been improved with the help of $ 700million in refurbishments not exactly noodles : at the on - campus restaurant @entity84 , @entity27 students enjoy a five - course meal once a week good game : the campus also has an arcade - but not even the machines in the gaming hall costs the students anything fore : students hoping to improve their short game need to look no further than the college 's putting green it is all thanks to the university ’s president , dr @entity98 , a millionaire entrepreneur who took over the campus eight years ago			1
after managing to raise millions to clean up the campus and build new facilities , he now dedicates his life to leading the university			2
in a @entity109 documentary about his journey , @entity107 - born dr @entity98 says : ‘ i 'm in the business of planting seeds of greatness in the minds and also in the hearts and souls of our students			2
’ ' all the lessons i have learned in my life , i now bring them to a university campus			0
’ his work has not been for nothing , although tuition and living costs has gone up by 60 per cent , enrolment is up by 50 per cent and the average @entity131 score of students at @entity27 is ten per cent higher than eight years ago			0
last year dr @entity98 told @entity133 he plans improvements costing $ 2.1billion by 2020 , including a new sports arena			0
