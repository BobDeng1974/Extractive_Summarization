@entity7 , 27 , targeted aircrafts coming in to land at @entity9 but claims he was ' was just mucking around ' and ' was n't thinking '			1
twice he aimed the beam at passenger planes , one of which was carrying 28 people - but despite risking lives with his reckless behaviour , @entity7 , of @entity17 , walked free from court today			1
spared jail : @entity7 said he ' was just mucking around ' when he shone a laser pen into the cockpits of passenger planes and was spared a prison sentence after a judge heard how he had mental health problems sparing him jail , a judge warned how his actions could have caused a crash and stated he ' could not think of anything more dangerous ' to do			1
recorder @entity30 made the decision after @entity33 heard how @entity7 had mental health problems			2
he shone a beam at a cockpit of a @entity39 plane on a flight from @entity41 that was preparing to land at @entity9 just before 9pm on september 9 last year , the court heard prosecutor @entity42 told the court co-pilot @entity43 was reaching a critical point in the landing stage when he saw a light reflecting off the plane 's window			1
dangerous : @entity7 aimed the laser beam at several aircrafts including a @entity52 plane , which was carrying 28 passengers , forcing the captain to switch off his external lights to land mr @entity42 said : ' fortunately the light was n't in his eyes			1
he recognised the potential danger but was able to land the plane safely			2
' a similar @entity52 plane behind , captained by @entity61 , was carrying 28 passengers and three other crew members and was coming in from @entity64 , @entity65			1
mr @entity42 said captain @entity61 had previously suffered temporary blindness and disorientation after a beam had been shone into his eyes so was considerably concerned when he spotted the light from @entity7 's pen			1
he made the decision to switch off his external lights , a call he would not usually make , but he considered it less of a risk than being blinded by the laser and was able to land safely			2
he shone a beam ( like the one pictured ) at a cockpit of a @entity39 plane on a flight from @entity41 that was preparing to land at @entity9 an image from a previous unrelated incident , in which a laser pen was shone at a helicopter , demonstrates the blinding effect the device can have on pilots mr @entity42 said the matter was reported to police , who launched the force helicopter and found the source of light was coming from a compound near the @entity96 in @entity97			1
the pen was discovered under a rock and @entity7 was arrested and taken to the police station where he admitted being responsible			2
@entity7 said he was ' just mucking around ' and ' was n't thinking ' and accepted shining it at four or five planes on coffee breaks			1
@entity7 , from @entity104 , @entity17 , admitted three charges of negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger aircraft			2
he received a six month suspended sentence with 12 months supervision			0
@entity110 , defending , said his autism and lack of understanding of consequences explains why he shone the light at planes			0
he said : ' a reasonable person would know the potential consequences of what he was doing			0
he did n't think through the consequences of his actions and carried on doing it			0
also targeted : a @entity123 ( like the one above ) was called out and officers traced the source of the light and were able to arrest @entity7 , who admitted responsibility ' one of his problems is that he gets bored very easily , lacks concentration and acts impulsively			2
' he fully understands the case against him			0
the difficulty is the lack of understanding of the implications of his actions			0
' urging the court to impose a suspended sentence , mr @entity110 said : ' he is vulnerable and would n't take well to a prison regime			0
he would be a fish out of water			0
' @entity142 said : ' they were flying over urban areas and if the planes had crash landed , there would have a likely high level number of injuries and damage			0
' i can not think of anything more dangerous in our modern world than shining a beam into the eyes of people flying aircraft			0
' i hope you have got it into your head the amount of damage you nearly did and you will never , never put yourself into this kind of situation again			0
