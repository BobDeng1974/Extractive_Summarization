by @entity0 for @entity1 astronomers have been scrutinising high - definition photos of @entity4 sent back by the @entity6 spacecraft			2
and now a shortlist of five possible sites that could become the location for the first - ever landing on a comet , have been drawn up by the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
in mid-november , @entity11 intends to send down a robot laboratory named @entity13 , which will harpoon itself to the comet 's surface and carry out a battery of scientific tests , the results of which astronomers hope will help them work out how planets formed			1
@entity11 has now identified five ‘ candidate ’ zones for landing , but has says that ‘ choosing the right landing site is a complex process ’			1
one final location will be selected , as well as a back - up			0
the topography must be relatively flat and clear and the surface stable			0
there also has to be sufficient sunlight to recharge the lander 's batteries beyond its initial 64 - hour lifetime - yet not so much as to cause overheating			0
at the same time , though , the site must offer the most potential to find scientific treasure			0
@entity29 comprises two lobes joined by a narrow neck , which make it look a little bit like a rubber duck in space			2
zoom in on the image below to find out where @entity6 is at the moment in mid-november , @entity11 intends to send down a robot laboratory , @entity13 , which will harpoon itself to the comet 's surface and carry out a battery of scientific tests			1
this is an artist 's impression of @entity13 on the surface of comet @entity71 the selection of five possible sites was informed by images of the rocky body , including this @entity77 , which can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with red – green / blue filters			1
it was created by merging two images taken last week by the @entity6 probe as it circled around the comet @entity6 also recently measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70 ° @entity90 )			1
although it may seem cold , that is actually 20 to @entity93 ( 36 to 54 ° f ) warmer than predicted for a comet at that distance , suggesting its surface will be quite dusty in addition to being icy			0
' this result is very interesting , since it gives us the first clues on the composition and physical properties of the comet ’s surface , ' says @entity108 principal investigator @entity107 from @entity109 , @entity110			0
this suggests that much of the surface must be dusty , because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice			0
three of the candidate sites are on the smaller lobe , or head of the ' duck , ' and two are on the larger lobe , or the body , @entity11 said			1
comets are believed by astrophysicists to be ancient ice and dust left from the building of the @entity34 around 4.6 billion years ago			0
this cosmic rubble is essentially a time capsule - the oldest , least - touched material in our stellar neighbourhood			0
it is hoped that understanding its chemical and physical composition will give experts insights into how the planets formed after the sun flared into light			0
@entity6 is equipped with an array of sensors to help answer the question , but the biggest discoveries could be made by the 10 instruments aboard the 220lb ( 100kg ) @entity13 lander			2
the 2.5 mile ( 4km ) comet is on a six - and - a - half - year orbit around the sun and is currently 324 million miles ( 522 million km ) from the star			0
for a sense of scale , it is about three times the size of @entity156 and @entity6 is the size of a car with 105ft ( 32 metre ) wings			0
at their closest approach on august 13 2015 , the comet and @entity6 will be 114 million miles ( 185 million km ) from the sun , meaning an eightfold increase in the light received from the sun compared with present levels , @entity11 said			1
it took @entity6 two weeks before the spacecraft sent back its first detailed images of the comet ’s rocky surface			2
one image revealed a deep gorge in the centre and the comet 's ‘ head ’ , with parallel lines that look like cliffs			1
it also showed a cluster of building - sized boulders on the ‘ neck ’ of the comet			1
this is an artist 's impression of the @entity6 orbiter deploying the @entity13 lander to comet @entity71			1
after an extensive mapping phase by the orbiter between now and september , a final landing site will be selected for @entity13 to conduct in situ measurements in november this image was taken on the 15 of august			1
it shows a cluster of building - sized boulders on the ‘ neck ’ region			1
in mid-november , @entity11 intends to send down a robot laboratory , @entity13 , which will harpoon itself to the comet 's surface and carry out a battery of scientific tests three of the candidate sites are on the smaller lobe , or head of the " duck , " and two are on the larger lobe , or the body , @entity11 said			1
this image shows the comet 's ‘ head ’ os smaller lobe , with parallel linear features that look like cliffs taken on the 14th august , this image was taken from a distance of about 62 miles ( 100km ) from the comet			1
comets are believed by astrophysicists to be ancient ice and dust left from the building of the @entity34 around 4.6 billion years ago the @entity224 has released a @entity77 version of the comet , which appears to jump out of the screen if you wear stereoscopic glasses			0
‘ i was impressed that on the neck that connects the two parts of the comet there is something like the side of a mountain , ' mission director , @entity230 , told @entity1			2
' it 's like looking at the @entity240 on a very high wall			0
it makes you feel like you want to climb it , and on one of the few areas that seem to be flat there are boulders 20 to 30 metres wide , they look like houses			0
’ described as ‘ the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever ’ , @entity6 will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on @entity256			2
the comet has been dubbed the ‘ rubber duck ’ in space and recent photos have revealed that its target , @entity71 is actually what is known as a ‘ contact binary ’			1
this means it is likely two comets stitched together , in what could turn out to be both a blessing and a curse			0
it could have been fractured in the past or it could be two different objects that very slowly came into contact at speeds of a few metres per second			0
this irregular structure makes it harder for scientists to calculate the comet 's gravitational pull , to help steer the probe			2
@entity6 recently measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70 ° @entity90 ) .			2

shortlist of five possible landing sites have been drawn up by @entity11
space agency will send a robot laboratory called @entity13 to the surface of comet @entity71 in november
@entity13 will harpoon itself on the comet 's surface and conduct tests
images taken by @entity6 show rubber - duck shape of the comet
three proposed landing sites are on the ' duck 's head '
recent *3d* image shows a cluster of building - sized boulders on the ‘ neck ’
