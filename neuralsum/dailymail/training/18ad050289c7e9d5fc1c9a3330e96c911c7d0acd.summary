by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 22:54 est , 23 april 2012 updated : 10:46 est , 24 april 2012 the iconic @entity4 @entity3 sports car that brought affordable sports car motoring to the masses is to be reborn in the 21st century – designed by @entity4 but built in @entity7			1
the new @entity8 was unveiled as one of the undoubted stars of the @entity11 and is a modern take on a much loved classic which is still seen widely on the road today			2
it was unveiled by the @entity8 company which is now part of the giant @entity17 ( @entity17 ) which also owns @entity18 following the collapse of @entity18 under the controversial stewardship of the ‘ @entity21 ’ led by @entity22			2
back on the road : @entity8 's @entity7 owners showed off the company 's new sports car , the @entity8 , at the 2012 @entity28 motor show the modern - day take on the classic @entity4 sports car is expected to be launched in 2014 its @entity4 design team said they had taken cues from the original @entity3 to create a modern take on the sports car			1
although the show model is a coupe , a soft - top roadster is also set to follow			1
but the @entity7 love of @entity4 sports cars carried through to the @entity8 stand itself which proudly bore the company badge			1
alongside mini-skirted @entity7 girls were references to ‘ @entity47 ’ from which the letters are said to derive , pictures of the company ’s founder @entity42 and a giant map of the @entity4 painted as a patriotic @entity49 in red white and blue			1
there were even photographs of @entity53 on the walls			2
insiders say the car is likely to go on sale around 2014 at a price of around £ 16,000			1
although it will be manufactured in @entity7 , it is possible that some could be sent to the @entity4 in kit form for final assembly at @entity8 ’s @entity65 factory in @entity66			1
@entity67 : although the model on show was a coupe , a soft - top roadster is also set to follow @entity72 view : according to the car 's @entity4 designer the rear haunches were inspired by the firm 's 1955 model the @entity79 pledge : although it will be manufactured in @entity7 , it is possible that some cars could be sent to the @entity4 in kit form for final assembly at @entity8 's @entity65 factory in @entity66 the @entity8 project ’s chief designer , @entity66 born @entity84 , 53 , who started as an @entity86 apprentice and also worked on the @entity88 and @entity89 sports car during his 35 year career , said : ’ @entity8 in @entity7 is seen as a young person ’s brand			1
it ’s also a global brand			2
' we did n’t want to create a retro car			2
but we wanted to show how the @entity3 would have developed had its production not been ended in 1980			2
it ’s sporty , small but practical			0
' there are two seats in the back if you need to take the kids			0
we ’re showing a coupe			0
but why not a roadster ? ’ and @entity108 - @entity107 , 37 , who is global director of design for all of the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) said : ’ we set out to create a modern car , not a retro car			0
@entity113 - born father of two mr @entity107 , who studied automotive design at @entity115 and worked himself for seven years for the @entity18 at @entity65 , added : ’ since we took the covers off we ’ve had so many people from around the world come up to us and say " we used to have an @entity3 "			0
it ’s struck a chord ' , he said			0
head turner : the car was one of the undeniable stars of the @entity11 sleek : an artist 's impression of what the interior of the new roadster version will look like unlike the original the roadster will offer ample space for four and a generous boot the original @entity3 was launched as a soft - top roadster in 1962 , with a fixed - head coupe following three years later in 1965			1
it was built until october 1980 at @entity8 ’s factory at @entity138 in under the umbrella of @entity8 , the @entity140 and its successors , @entity142 and @entity143			0
more than half a million were built altogether over the 18 year lifespan , of which more than 125,000 are the hard - topped @entity3 coupes			0
work on a successor for the @entity3 had been undertaken as long ago as 1968 , but @entity143 had pulled the plug on that project by the end of 1970			0
when the @entity138 factory finally closed in the autumn of 1980 , @entity143 did not replace it			0
but second hand versions of both the @entity3 and roaster versions of the @entity3 continue to provide affordable sporty motoring for many and sell for between £ 1,500 and more than £ 9,000 depending on condition			1
@entity8 cars were the creation of @entity42 , general manager of @entity47 in @entity160 , who , in 1923 , fitted special sports bodies onto standard @entity47 chassis			0
after years as part of @entity143 and its many incarnations , it has undergone a tumultuous few years - having been sold to @entity166 's @entity165 ; who then offloaded it with the blessing of the last @entity169 ' to the infamous ' @entity21 ' directors led by @entity22 , before it went bust , sparking a major scandal inquiry			0
it was then snapped up for a song by the @entity7 and is now owned by the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) which also owns @entity18 , which it has renamed ‘ @entity175 ’ for the @entity7 market , and runs the @entity8 factory at @entity65 in @entity66 which assembles some cars such as the @entity178 from kits supplied from @entity7			1
heyday : the original @entity3 was launched as a soft - top roadster in 1962 , with a fixed - head coupe following three years later in 1965			0
production ended in 1980 cool customer : an advert for the @entity3 sports car taken from a @entity4 @entity188 brochure in the 1970s @entity8 and @entity18 were bought for just £ 10 after @entity165 , which bought it in 1994 , decided to off - load the loss - making company in 2000 following six years of controversy and rising costs and after a potential sale to venture capital company @entity196 - opposed by unions and many @entity198 - fell through			2
ministers were pleased by the rival @entity21 consortium deal because it kept @entity18 alive in the run up to he 2001 @entity203 at a time when its failure would have been acutely damaging in key @entity207 marginal seats			0
when the firm finally went bust with a loss of 6,300 jobs in april 2005 just before that year 's general election - and with dozens of marginal seats at risk - the then prime minister @entity215 and his chancellor @entity216 rushed to @entity66 to appear hands - on during the crisis which saw the @entity7 picking up the company for a song from the receivers			1
@entity8 was initially bought from the administrators in 2005 by @entity223 ( @entity224 ) which in turn was taken over by @entity17 in a merger ' encouraged ' by the @entity7 government			1
the @entity21 directors made around £ 40million from their stewardship of the car firm but have always denied charges of ' asset - stripping '			2
but one senior @entity165 boss described the ' @entity21 ' directors as ' the unacceptable face of capitalism '			0
the @entity65 factory sprang back to life under @entity7 ownership in august 2008 to re-start production of a two - seater @entity8 sports car , the two - seater @entity243 sports car .			1
