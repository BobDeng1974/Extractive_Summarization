researchers have discovered that the brain can remember ' neutral ' or boring events more easily when they are tied to an emotion from what we eat to what we see , we constantly take in details about our environment			1
and while there is no need to remember many of them , our brain has the remarkable ability to store information that seems inconsequential at the time in case it becomes useful later on			1
given new and relevant information , human beings have the capacity to strengthen weak memories using emotions - and researchers have said this points to the adaptive nature of human memory			1
psychologists at @entity27 have been trying to gain an understanding about how the brain stores memories for ' emotionally neutral events ' that gain significance through subsequent experience			1
' how does the brain store all of this information ? and how does emotion strengthen mundane memories ? ' post-doctoral fellows @entity37 and @entity38 wrote on @entity41			1
this study largely focused on how our brains remember emotionally arousing stimuli , such as evocative imagery or traumatic events			0
in particular , the study has looked into how the september 11 terrorist attacks in the the @entity49 affect memory retention			2
the researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events better than we remember neutral events , like a lunch date			1
emotion increases our ability to remember by affecting activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - particularly the amygdala and striatum - and also the regions involved in encoding new experiences , like the hippocampus			1
strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events , such as a surprise birthday party thrown by close friends , and for negative events , such as making an embarrassing faux pas at the office holiday party			2
researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events , like 9/11 , better than we remember neutral events , like a lunch date			1
this is because emotion affects activity in certain brain regions			0
a view over the @entity85 towards the september 11th memorial lights is shown a power nap of just 45 minutes can boost memory by five times , research has found			1
a short doze helps you to retain information you have learned and ' significantly ' improves recall , scientists said – meaning naps really could help students revising for exams			0
participants in the study learned 90 single words and 120 unconnected word pairs such as ' milk taxi '			0
some then watched a dvd while others slept			0
when they were then retested , those who had slept remembered more word pairs , the journal @entity109 and @entity110 reported last month			0
scientists from @entity112 in @entity113 , said that during sleep , bursts of brain activity known as sleep spindles play an important role in consolidating newly learned information			1
professor @entity120 said a nap of just 45 minutes to an hour ' produces a five-fold improvement in information retrieval from memory '			2
' the memory performance of the participants who had a power nap was just as good as it was before sleeping , that is , immediately after completing the learning phase			0
' while many details are not intrinsically emotionally arousing , they can gain emotional significance through our experiences			2
for example , the memory of a surprise birthday party includes details like what people were wearing and who was there			2
on the face of it , these details are not emotionally significant but we remember them because of the context in which they were experienced			2
dr @entity37 and dr @entity38 ’s research has shown that people have better memory for boring information when it ’s presented in an emotional context , regardless of if it is rewarding or negative			1
‘ in some of our earlier studies , we found that people selectively remember neutral pictures if the pictures had been associated with an electrical shock the previous day , even when the volunteers were unaware that we would later test their memory , they wrote			1
‘ we have also shown that people remember neutral pictures if they are warned that if they forget them , they will receive a shock the next day			0
‘ likewise , being rewarded with money for remembering certain pictures the next day can boost memory for those pictures as well			0
’ these experiments focus on emotional factors at the time the original memory is created and the findings show how seemingly trivial information associated with a meaningful event can be selectively preserved in memory			1
emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation			0
strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events , such as a surprise birthday party ( stock image ) , and for negative events , such as making an embarrassing faux pas at an office party emotion affects activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - such as the amygdala ( pictured ) and regions involved in encoding new experiences , like the hippocampus ( also marked ) but what happens when the emotional event happens after the original memories were formed ? ‘ in a recent study , we found that an emotional experience can enhance memory for neutral information encountered previously , ’ the researchers continued			1
volunteers viewed a series of trivial pictures from two categories , either animals or tools			0
after a delay , volunteers were presented with a new set of animal and tool pictures – only this time , when the volunteer saw the pictures they received an electrical shock to the wrist			0
‘ we already knew that memory would be strengthened for the pictures paired with the electrical shock			0
but here we found that if we paired shocks with pictures of animals , memory was strengthened for pictures of animals volunteers saw before any shocks were delivered			2
‘ if we shocked volunteers when they where shown pictures of tools , memory for the earlier pictures of tools was strengthened			0
’ the negative experience selectively increased memory for related information that was completely trivial when it was originally experienced			1
we use our memory not only to remember the past , but to guide our decisions in the future			0
emotion helps us remember relevant information to determine our choices , but without the ability to strengthen seemingly trivial past experiences with new important information , we might end up missing out on future rewards or repeating the same mistakes .			0

@entity27 psychologists studied how the brain stores memories
found boring details become more memorable with emotional context
emotional experience can enhance memory for old neutral information
