to be fair , @entity0 and @entity1 claimed that weekend first			1
the @entity3 couple chose sept. 26 for their wedding and then planned accordingly : they booked their venue , a former factory building in one of the city 's most historic neighborhoods			2
they hired a @entity13 purchased her dress			0
then @entity15 announced he was coming to town — the same day			1
' we ca n't compete with the pope , ' said @entity0			1
forced out : @entity0 and @entity1 are just one of the @entity3 couples who 've been forced to reschedule their late september wedding because of the pope 's visit to the city my bad ! @entity15 is making his first trip to the @entity27 and the anticipated crowd of some 1.5 million devotees has hotel rooms booked solid for miles around the couple 's story is a cautionary tale for anyone planning to do something in @entity3 during the last weekend of september , when the pontiff expects to make his first visit to the @entity27			1
organizers predict 1.5 million people will visit the city to see @entity15 as part of the @entity43			1
@entity0 and @entity1 found out about the conflict when his sister called to say she was hoping to see her little brother married and the @entity48 in one shot			1
at first , the couple was concerned but not frantic			0
they began checking for possible hotel blocks for their guests			2
they found nothing within 10 miles			2
' i had a moment of pure panic , about 20 minutes of hysterical crying when i was yelling at @entity1 for no apparent reason , ' said @entity0 , 35 , gallery manager for @entity61 furniture company @entity60			1
' he was like a deer in headlights			0
' @entity65 , 41 , an architect , ' i called the venue woman at 9 o'clock on a sunday night to see if we could change the date so she would stop crying			0
' they now plan to marry oct. 9			0
no choice : @entity71 and @entity72 are also competing with the pope on their wedding day			2
unlike other couples , @entity76 and @entity72 were unable to reschedule			1
they were forced to book hotel rooms a half - hour from their church tourism and hospitality officials said the impact of @entity15 ' appearance is unlike anything they 've experienced in recent memory			1
' his visit changes the whole paradigm , ' said @entity90 , chief executive of the @entity91			2
to illustrate how crowded things could get , @entity90 offered this : imagine if , on one weekend , the downtown convention center was hosting 30,000 people while @entity96 and @entity97 performed on a nearby public stage at the same time the area 's major sports clubs — @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , 76ers and even the @entity105 soccer team — were playing championship games at local venues			1
' that 's how you can get the magnitude of what 's happening , ' he said			0
@entity113 , sales and marketing director for @entity115 's @entity115 near @entity116 , said his team told a few couples who wanted to have their weddings there during the papal visit that it was not a good idea			1
' we 're a boutique - style hotel and we would n't be able to provide that memorable experience for them , ' he said			2
afloat : @entity127 and @entity128 were forced to reschedule their @entity129 inspired nuptials because of the papal visit the hotel has 268 rooms , and about 30 of them have already been booked by a @entity136 delegation from the @entity137			1
@entity115 is now figuring out its strategy for renting the other rooms			2
single - night reservations wo n't be accepted ; the hotel will most likely require guests stay for three nights			0
' it may look like a lot of hotels are sold out online , but what you 're finding is they 're not accepting that stay pattern of just friday and saturday , ' @entity113 said			0
even @entity151 , executive director of the @entity152 , said he may end up sleeping on an inflatable mattress on his office floor during the pope 's stay			0
' i have connections in the hotel business , obviously , and i could n't get myself a room , ' he said			0
@entity0 and @entity1 said they 've recovered from their initial shock and accepted their new wedding date — a friday instead of a saturday , as originally planned			1
not ideal , they said , but it 's the only date that allowed them to marry first and still go on their planned honeymoon later in october			0
the @entity169 was able to accommodate them as well			0
and while they may have lost a few years from their lives during that one panicky night , they lost no money			0
they 're joking about it now			0
that 's a good thing			0
' people are saying , ' you should have just gotten the pope to marry you , '' @entity0 said			1

the september papal visit to the city of brotherly love has many area couples *scrambling* to reschedule their nuptials
@entity0 and @entity1 could find no hotel rooms within 50 miles of the city on that weekend and were forced to reschedule
the fall visit , part of the @entity43 , will be pope @entity15 ' first visit to the @entity27
