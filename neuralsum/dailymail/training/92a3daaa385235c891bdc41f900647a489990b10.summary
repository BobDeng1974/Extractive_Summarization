by @entity1 medical correspondent three cuppas a day keep the doctor away : tea can help your heart , according to new research drinking three cups of tea a day can help to ward off heart disease by improving circulation , scientists claim			1
a reaearch team found that high levels of tea - drinking reduce the ‘ stiffness ’ in arteries , keeping them younger and more elastic and speeding up circulation			1
the results were the same for all types of tea , including black tea and green tea			0
high consumption was classified as more than 450ml daily , which is three large cups a day , over the course of a year			0
scientists in @entity30 measured the tea intake of 3,135 healthy people and compared it against the performance of their circulation system			1
the findings , published in the science journal @entity37 , showed that those who drank more tea had a 22 per cent cut in measurements of arterial stiffness			1
people drinking moderate amounts of tea did not have a reduction in risk			1
scientists say flavonoids found in tea are responsible for the benefits , as these compounds have been shown to improve arterial function , possibly by increasing nitric oxide production			1
the findings come from the first study to evaluate the link between tea consumption and abnormal arterial stiffness using a brachial ankle test			2
the test compares blood pressure measured at the ankle to blood pressure measured at the arm , using a pressure cuff wrapped around both arms and ankles			0
it is a good indicator of how well blood flows around the body			0
time for a brew : tea has health benefits , it is claimed - though the jury 's still out on the biscuit the researchers from universities in @entity30 took account of factors such as age , sex , current smoking , alcohol consumption , exercise and obesity which can influence study findings			1
the volunteers were drawn from a healthy population who did not have diagnosed heart problems			0
the researchers said : ‘ arterial stiffness is characterised by arterial wall thickening and loss of elasticity			0
‘ independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors , arterial stiffness is a predictor of total mortality and future disease , such as myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) , heart failure and stroke			0
’ the study added : ‘ tea , the most commonly consumed beverage after water , has attracted considerable attention for its potential cardioprotective effects			2
‘ the benefits of tea consumption in cardiovascular health are thought to be largely due to flavonoids , which may reduce arterial stiffness by augmenting nitric oxide production			2
’ this can help open up the blood vessels in the body , says the study			0
@entity120 institution : we are a nation of tea - drinkers , from @entity124 to @entity125 to @entity126 overall , flavonoids found in tea are thought to control inflammation , reduce excess blood clotting , promote blood vessel function and limit furring up of the arteries			1
one cup of tea provides 150 - 200mg of flavonoids and it is the best source in the @entity120 diet			2
in terms of the delivery of antioxidants , two cups of tea is equivalent to five portions of vegetables or two apples			2
other research shows tea drinkers have a lower risk of cancer , of around 30 per cent			0
dr @entity149 , spokesman for the industry body the @entity150 , said ‘ of note is that the study group was drawn from an apparently healthy population and as such is a good reflection of a normal group of tea consumers			1
‘ this is good news for @entity120 ’s tea drinkers as this study contributes to the growing evidence of tea ’s benefits for the health of the heart and vascular system			0

tea has plant materials called flavonoids which make arteries more elastic
people who drank more than three cups improved by 22 per cent
