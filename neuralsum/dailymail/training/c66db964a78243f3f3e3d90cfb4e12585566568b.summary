by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:41 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:53 est , 17 december 2013 an overweight barman who went on a diet to get a girlfriend is now fighting off the ladies after becoming a dead ringer for @entity9 's @entity8			2
@entity10 , 20 , tipped the scales at over 14 stone due to his habitual heavy drinking sessions and a love of takeaways			1
but @entity10 decided to get in shape to land a girlfriend , lost four stone - and developed an uncanny resemblance to the @entity20 heartthrob			1
heading in the right direction : @entity10 , 20 , after he turned his life around by losing four stone and restyling himself as a @entity8 lookalike and after slimming down to 10 stone , he is now is swamped with offers from girls - and modelling agencies			1
@entity10 is even juggling two girlfriends at the same time			1
he said : ' i was always the funny guy , the guy who made you laugh but who was always single			0
i was the token fat lad of the group			0
' all my mates were skinny and had girlfriends , and so i overcompensated by being arrogant and thinking i was cool			0
before and after : @entity10 , pictured ( left ) at fourteen stone , shed four stone to get a girlfriend and is now fighting off the ladies after becoming a dead ringer for @entity8 ( right ) spot the difference : after slimming down to 10 stone , he is now is swamped with offers from girls - and modelling agencies - and is currently looking for work as a @entity8 ( right ) lookalike ' in reality , i was just self - conscious and insecure			1
i did n't realise i looked anything like @entity8 until my friends told me i should start modelling			2
' i put some pictures up on @entity56 and i was inundated with messages from girls telling me how much i looked like him			2
' now , when i go to the pub or go out on a night out , girls just flock to me asking me for my number			2
' @entity10 , of @entity62 , @entity63 - the same county as @entity8 - piled on the pounds late in his teens , although he admits he was a chubby school kid			1
he said : ' i was always the fat one , but when i started drinking , that 's when it got worse			0
i hated being around my mates who were skinny and had girlfriends			0
that 's what makes him beautiful : he piled on the pounds with heavy drinking sessions and takeaways - before turning over a new leaf with the popular 5:2 diet ' i used to just laugh off my problems and i would drink five days of the week , and never do any exercise			1
' i tried to lose weight in the past , but with no girlfriend to notice , i gave up pretty quickly			0
' @entity10 , who works part - time as a barman , decided enough was enough , and after reading an article about the 5:2 diet , he decided to give it a go			1
fasting for two days a week , and eating healthily on the other five , @entity10 saw the difference almost immediately			2
as he was : @entity10 tipped the scales at more than 14 stone and described himself as the ' class clown ' who no one took seriously ' the first two weeks were the toughest because my body had to get used to being denied food , ' he said			1
' after that my stomach shrank and i was n't able to eat what i did before			0
' i started cycling four miles every day and the weight just fell off			0
' @entity10 lost four stone in total , and the transformation has turned his life around			1
he approached an agency and is now modelling part - time , but he says the best thing about looking like @entity8 is the attention he gets from girls			2
he said : ' it 's a massive compliment that girls even find me attractive at all , as i still see the same lad , just a bit skinnier			0
' my confidence has increased enormously , and i ca n't go to a pub without getting propositioned			0
and if they think i 'm really him , who am i to tell them otherwise ? ' i 'm not a huge fan of @entity9 , but after people told me i looked like one of them , i started listening to them			0
now , i 'm a total one @entity9			0
' back in the day : @entity10 , of @entity62 , @entity63 - the same county as @entity8 - piled on the pounds in his teens			1

@entity10 , 20 , from @entity62 , weighed 14 stone
piled on weight die to love of takeaways and heavy drinking sessions
slimmed to 10 stone on 5:2 diet
swamped with offers from girls and modelling agencies
