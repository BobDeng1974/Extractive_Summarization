the post , which reportedly received thousands of ' likes ' from her 230,000 followers , was deemed a ' hate speech ' by @entity2 ms @entity8 says , and she was locked out of her account as a result			1
miss @entity8 – who was accused of ‘ fat shaming ’ when she posted a portrait of herself in workout gear online last month along with the caption ‘ what ’s your excuse ? ’ - said she did not intend to upset people and was merely ' telling the truth			1
' ' we need to change this strange mentality we are breeding in the @entity43 and start celebrating people who are a result of hard work , dedication and discipline ' she says the online campaign launched by @entity51 , the owner of @entity9 plus - size shop @entity17 , ' normalizes being unhealthy			1
' however , ms @entity51 says her intention is show that ' women with rolls , bumps [ and ] lumps			2
can be stunning and beautiful ' too			0
unenthused by the photo project , ms @entity8 continued : ' we need to change this strange mentality we are breeding in the @entity43 and start celebrating people who are a result of hard work , dedication and discipline			1
' i ’m not bashing those who are proud and overweight , i am empowering those who are proud and healthy to come out and be the real role models in our society			0
' body confidence : in a bid to celebrate ' real beauty ' without the magic of @entity72 , ms @entity51 appealed to women who are @entity43 size 14 or up to post ' sexy ' selfies on her professional @entity2 page but ms @entity8 wrote on @entity2 last friday that she was ' annoyed ' by ' stories about how overweight should be proud of their bodies ' - referring directly to the @entity17 campaign ( above ) stirring trouble : ms @entity8 came to the public 's attention last month when she posted this photo of her toned post-baby body to @entity2 many of ms @entity8 's fans backed her up			1
one wrote : ' you got blocked because people ca n't handle the truth ! ' and another added : ' i do n't know how many of your comments you actually get to read when you have so many , but i will say this			1
as a former seriously obese woman i am behind you speaking the truth 100 %			2
' i 'm not bashing those who are proud and overweight , i am empowering those who are proud and healthy to come out ' ' loving your body is one thing , but when you are overweight you really do n't love yourself			0
it 's impossible when you are killing yourself with every bite you take			0
' but another was less impressed with miss @entity8 's views , writing : ' un-liking this girl now			2
she 's gotten so annoying			2
she is semi-rude to people who are overweight			0
posting stuff like this gives you the " oh poor you " " you 're the victim in all this " that you 're craving			0
' it makes her annoying and judgmental			2
i think i 'd rather be fat and happy than in shape and annoying like her			1
' and ms @entity51 who launched the @entity17 campaign told @entity115 : ' everyone is entitled to their opinion			0
venting her rage : ms @entity8 said that she received an email from @entity2 stating that her post referencing the @entity17 campaign violated community standards ' but my page is our little space in the cyber world			1
