by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 27 september 2013 jailed : @entity1 admitted common assault by beating a heroin dealer who subjected his battered wife to a year of ‘ hell ’ after he terrorised her into wearing a veil has been jailed but may go free - in just eight weeks			1
@entity1 , 21 - who in 2010 was sent to a young offenders institute for possessing heroin with intent to supply - had ordered his terrified spouse to wear a full niqab after she said she was going to college to study			1
initially he called her a ‘ slag and b * * * * ’ for wanting to better her education , then sneered : ‘ you are a married woman			2
you do n’t do this			2
’ the unnamed wife only agreed to wear the full face veil , with just eye holes after thinking he would stop him making her life a misery			2
but instead @entity1 began beating her - initially because she was not smiling during @entity27 celebrations with family			1
during a catalogue of violent and controlling behaviour , @entity1 from @entity29 , @entity30 , ripped her tongue , kicked and punched her , inflicted black eyes on her and battered her confidence			1
he also tracked her movements using his mobile phone , tried to stop her going to college , accused her of cheating and falsely claiming there were ‘ spies ’ in their loft			2
when the victim became pregnant she was found to have injuries to her body and eye when she went to hospital for a 16 - week check - up			1
and when she later went through a traumatic birth delivering a premature baby , @entity1 was so enraged that a male doctor was treating his wife afterwards , a female medic had to be brought			1
he was also very irate and threatening to people trying to help the family			2
the wife finally escaped from his clutches after he subjected her to a sustained attack in which he stabbed her with scissors and hit her with a dumbell			2
details of her ordeal emerged at @entity29 magistrates court as @entity1 was locked away for 16 weeks after admitting common assault by beating			1
he was also given an indefinite restraining order to keep him away from the victim			2
the sentence means @entity1 could be free in just two months for good behaviour			1
the maximum sentence he could have faced was six months			2
after the case @entity71 , head of the domestic violence division at law firm @entity73 , said : ‘ the sentence is an insult to the victim and people will view the punishment as a slap on the wrist			2
‘ there has been a prolonged 12 - month ordeal , so why was only one charge brought ? it ’s absolutely shocking and it makes me really angry			0
‘ if this was an attack by a stranger in the street , i can guarantee it would have been a different story			0
domestic violence is often under - sentenced and too much blame is given to the victims			0
’ earlier , prosecutor miss @entity95 said the beatings began after @entity1 ‘ interrogated ’ his wife about going to college and wearing the veil			1
he had qualified for the welfare support payments as he could not walk more than five - metres in a minute - but he should not have been able to claim the payments while living outside the @entity103 , @entity100 heard last november the couple had been at @entity27 celebrations with family , she was playing with some children and @entity1 demanded to know why she was not smiling			1
he slapped her face and pushed her against a wall and held her there			0
miss @entity95 said he apologised , the relationship continued but he then accused the victim of talking to men when she was out			0
the victim , then four months pregnant , said she was n’t , but was given a black eye			0
she pleaded with him to stop the abuse and in april the baby was born 10 weeks prematurely			1
it was kept in special care and every day when the victim returned home from visiting the infant , she was met with further insults			0
the couple separated but got back together and @entity1 accused neighbours of spying on her			1
he ordered her to sit down in silence , left his iphone on record and checked it on his return to make sure she had not spoken to anybody			0
he claimed there were people spying and people in the loft			0
miss @entity95 said on september 17 , the victim tried to pacify @entity1 when he believed people were in the house and was angry			1
he punched her repeatedly , told her he did n’t believe she was n’t cheating , rammed his fingers in her mouth , pulled her tongue and scratched it until it bled			1
he kicked and struck her thigh , picked up some scissors and threatened to stab her			1
the victim put up her right arm and @entity1 plunged the scissors into her hand , causing a deep gash			1
he then struck her on the back with a large dumbell			0
the victim escaped to her mother ’s , where her injuries were seen and she told of the abuse			0
the victim had a black eye , cuts to her face , hand and leg and her tongue was sore			1
miss @entity95 added : ‘ the defendant is not interested in showing any remorse in any way , shape or form , with regards to the hell he has put this lady through over the last 12 months			0
‘ if that does n’t warrant an immediate custodial sentence at the higher level , i do n’t know what does			0
’ in mitigation defence lawyer @entity180 said : ‘ it ’s not often that i am lost for words			0
’ he said what @entity1 had done would probably cause lasting scars to the victim and her family			1
his family was very upset with him			0
the solicitor continued : ‘ his actions have affected quite a number of people and i would say that quite a number of lives have , in effect , been destroyed			0
there is nothing that allows the defendant to behave in that manner			0
i feel sorry for the victim in this case			0
