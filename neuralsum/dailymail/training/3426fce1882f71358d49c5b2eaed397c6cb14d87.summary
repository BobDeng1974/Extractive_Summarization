the question of who may be buried in an enormous and mysterious tomb in northern @entity3 has titillated archaeologists for months			1
but now , at a well - known burial just 100 miles ( 161km ) away from the @entity8 site , experts have confirmed that a grave unearthed decades ago , belongs to @entity11 ’s father			1
a team of researchers have confirmed that bones found in a two - chambered royal tomb at @entity16 , belong to @entity18 king @entity17 ( shown on this coin ) a total of 350 bones and fragments found in two caskets in the tomb were examined , @entity27 reported			1
researchers found trauma on some of the bones , which helped them decide they belonged to the ancient king of @entity37			2
they also found bones belonging to a female warrior , thought to be the daughter of the @entity41			1
a collection of photographs , x-rays and other evidence is expected to be released on friday at the @entity46 of @entity47 , to settle the debate about the tomb ’s occupants once and for all			2
a total of 350 bones and fragments found in two caskets in the tomb ( pictured ) were examined			1
researchers found trauma on some of the bones , which helped them decide they belong to the ancient @entity18 king the two - chambered royal tomb at @entity16 ( marked on the map ) lies in the north of @entity3 , some 100 miles away from @entity8 ( also marked ) , which is the site of a mysterious ancient tomb			1
archaeologists are working hard to establish who it belongs to the bones were first recovered in 1977 by @entity69 archaeologist @entity68 when he was excavating the mound , known as the @entity71			2
debate over whether the tomb really belonged to @entity17 has raged ever since			2
three tombs were found in the mound			0
the first , known as @entity75 , had been looted , but a wall painting of the @entity77 remained , along with bones			0
@entity79 was found untouched and mr @entity68 found the cremated remains of a male skeleton in the main chamber , along with the cremated remains of a woman in the antechamber			1
@entity17 was king of the @entity69 kingdom of @entity37 from 359 bc until his assassination in 336 bc. he was the father of @entity11 and @entity88 he is reported to have come up with the maxim ' divide and conquer '			2
the warrior king gained control of @entity3 and other lands along the @entity95 peninsular using a mixture of warfare , diplomacy and marriage alliances			1
he laid the foundations for his son 's impressive military feats , who went on to conquer many more lands stretching east from @entity3 and @entity105 to @entity106			2
it has been popularly claimed for decades that the tomb in @entity16 belongs to @entity17 , but now the new research has settled the debate			1
analysis of the king 's cremated remains reveal that he sustained many injuries in battle , including a laceration to his hand and rode a horse frequently			1
gold wreaths , silver and bronze vessels , weapons , amour and gold caskets , hinted that the tomb belonged to a member of a royal family			0
experts were unsure , whether the remains in @entity79 were @entity17 and one of his wives , or @entity88 , who was @entity11 ’s half - brother			1
@entity132 took the throne after @entity11 's death and the female could have been his wife , @entity135			0
to come to their conclusion , the researchers , led by @entity139 , scoured the bones for peculiarities that might give them clues			0
they found that the man suffered from frontal and maxillary sinusitis - inflammation of the lining of the sinuses - which was probably caused by an injury to the face			0
this could have been the result of an arrow that hit @entity154 in the right eye and blinded him at the siege of @entity157 in 354 bc. experts found others signs of wear and tear consistent with a warrior , such as trauma to the ribs and a wound on his left hand , which was likely caused by a weapon			2
lesions also led them to conclude that the bones are of a middle - aged man who rode a horse			0
the female remains also helped to shed light on the remains of @entity175 female was between 30 and 34 when she died , meaning that she could not be @entity88 ’ , wife , who was under 25			1
by studying the bones , anthropologists discovered that the woman was also a keen rider , was cremated soon after her death and had a slightly shorter left leg			0
all eyes are on a mysterious tomb ( pictured ) some 100 miles from @entity16 , where archaeologists seem close to revealing another secret of the ancient royal family			1
‘ this leads to the conclusion that the pair of mismatched greaves [ shin armour ] - the left is shorter - the @entity195 gorytus and weaponry found in the antechamber belonged to her , ’ mr @entity139 said			2
the researchers believe that the remains and armour belong to an unknown daughter of the @entity203 , who was defeated by @entity17 in 339 bc. ‘ no @entity18 king other than @entity17 is known to have had " relations " with a @entity203 , ’ @entity139 said			1
his team picked through over 100 never - studied bone fragments from @entity79 i to find that it was where seven people were laid to rest – a man , woman , child , four babies and a foetus			0
the find disproves previous theories that the looted chamber contained the remains of @entity154 and his family			0
the largest antique tomb ever found in @entity3 was unearthed in august in @entity8 , not far from the newly confirmed tomb belonging to @entity223 since then , archaeologists have debated who it may belong to , with candidates including @entity11 , his mother @entity227 , his wife @entity224 or an important general			1
now an intricate mosaic has been uncovered in the tomb , which lies around 100 miles ( 161km ) from @entity16 and @entity17 's confirmed grave			1
the mosaic measures 15 feet ( 4.5 metres ) by 10 feet ( 3 metres ) and covers the whole floor of a room , which is thought to be the ante chamber to the main burial room at @entity8			0
it shows a chariot drawn by two white horses , driven by a bearded man wearing a crown of laurel leaves			0
@entity246 - the messenger of the gods in ancient greece - stands in front of the chariot , according to experts from the @entity252			0
a number of scholars believe that the presence of female figures , known as caryatids , show that the tomb belongs to a female			0
experts have previously suggested that the tomb belongs to one of the king ’s officials			1
a broken marble door and large sculptures such as caryatids made marble that support an inner entrance into the tomb , have been found			0
a pair of sphinxes guarding the grave 's main entrance beneath a large arch , a painted lintel and other frescoes have also been discovered			0
it was feared that the tomb was completely looted , but the discovery of the treasures has given experts hope that they may finally find remains and solve the mystery of the unknown tomb			0
an imposing mosaic of a man driving a chariot ( pictured ) has been uncovered in the largest antique tomb ever found in @entity3			2
the find in @entity8 in northern @entity291 adds weight to archaeologists ’ suspicions that the burial mound could hold the remains of a family member of @entity11 - perhaps his mother			0
