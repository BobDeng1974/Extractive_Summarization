by @entity0 , @entity1 former @entity3 captain @entity2 was not surprised ex-world number one @entity5 was left out of @entity7 's team but admits occasionally decisions are made as much on gut feelings as form			1
the latter was certainly an issue for @entity5 , who has registered only one top - 10 finish since april , and he lost out in a four - way race with @entity16 , @entity17 and in - form rookie @entity18 for the three wildcard spots			1
@entity16 was an almost automatic pick after his inspirational performance at @entity22 two years ago , @entity17 is playing in his ninth @entity3 while @entity18 's recent displays virtually demanded inclusion			1
left out : @entity5 was left out of the 2014 @entity7 @entity3 team by captain @entity26 big decision : @entity7 captain @entity26 announces his wildcards to face the @entity30 instinct : @entity2 ( pictured ) believes @entity26 will have made a ' gut decision ' to omit @entity5 on that basis - despite having never lost in four events - it was an easier decision for captain @entity26 to leave out @entity5			1
@entity2 had a trickier task in 2006 when he led @entity7 to victory at the @entity38 - but not before his captaincy was branded pathetic by @entity40 after he missed out on a wildcard			1
at a time when only two wildcards were available he opted for @entity44 and @entity17 at the expense of the @entity46 , who qualified for this year 's team on merit			1
he admitted that decision came more down to instinct than anything else			0
' it is a shame you have to leave out someone like @entity5 but that is how it goes , i do n't think he 's holed enough putts all year to warrant a pick , ' @entity2 said			1
demanded inclusion : @entity18 's blistering recent form has earned him a wildcard criticism : @entity46 @entity40 branded @entity2 pathetic in 2006 for failing to name his as a wildcard ' in my time i had three people in my mind : it came down to either @entity40 , @entity17 and @entity44 and i 'd already picked @entity44			1
' it was a hard decision but what persuaded me was i felt @entity17 would go better with @entity44 , especially in the time of grieving @entity44 was going through ( having lost wife @entity71 to cancer weeks earlier ) , and everything worked out			2
' @entity17 partnered @entity44 in two matches and @entity44 won all his points that week			2
' you have a gut feeling , you feel who is going to play well under pressure			0
only one celebrating now : @entity17 ( right ) and @entity5 drink to @entity3 success two years ago ' i think with @entity40 at the @entity38 he had a couple of issues with a hole there ( the previous year he drove into water at the 17th three times to run up an 11 to lose the @entity87 ) and that sometimes put bad memories in your head			1
' @entity2 , an ambassador for bookmaker @entity91 , said team captaincy was all about man - management			2
' when i picked the team on the first day i think i left out @entity96 and @entity5 and they were whingeing a little bit as to why they were left out , ' he added			0
' but i went up to them and told them they were playing in the ( afternoon ) foursomes and that cheered them up then			0
glory : former captain @entity2 led @entity7 to @entity3 victory in 2006 at the @entity38 decisions : @entity2 ( right ) picked @entity44 ( left ) as one of his wildcards , just week 's after his wife died ' a captain has to get it into their heads quickly that they are all there to win the @entity3			1
' all they are is team members , nothing else			0
you are all as equal as each other , it does n't matter who wins the points as long as we win as a team			0
' @entity2 believes the absence from the @entity30 team of 14 - time major winner @entity128 due to injury will be viewed as a greater boost by the @entity30 than their counterparts			2
' how many times has @entity128 been in a winning team ? ' he said			0
' i think @entity7 are fearing more that @entity128 is not in the team because the @entity30 might be without him			0
' the @entity7 will be looking at the @entity30 team and seeing how they are as unit and how they play together			0
' missing pieces of the jigsaw : the three wildcard names are added to a board displaying @entity7 's team @entity2 was speaking on behalf of sports bookmaker @entity91			2
