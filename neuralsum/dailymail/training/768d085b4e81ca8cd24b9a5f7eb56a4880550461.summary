@entity1 ’s search for a new head coach is narrowing			1
@entity3 revealed on monday that reports of eight - man shortlists were exaggerated and that a handful of potential successors to @entity8 were instead being considered			2
@entity9 is the prime domestic - based candidate but the club are also looking to @entity12 with former @entity14 boss @entity13 the leading contender			1
here , we take a closer look at the two frontrunners for the @entity20 hotseat … @entity9 , on the touchline with @entity22 , has guided the @entity23 to third in the championship @entity9 current position : @entity22 ( manager ) previous jobs : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ( twice ) , @entity31 , @entity32 @entity33 : @entity34 ( @entity28 ) , @entity36 title ( @entity30 ) reasons for : @entity9 has always had a reputation as a fine and respected coach , and that is what @entity1 want			1
he is level - headed and will not speak out against the regime , knowing how to handle the media			0
@entity9 is admired within @entity20 ’ for the manner in which he has rebuilt his reputation after his failure with @entity29 and his knowledge of the @entity48 and @entity49 leagues – he won the title in the former - is invaluable given @entity1 ’s continental scouting model			1
@entity9 has previously managed @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 reasons against : it would take a compensation payment to release him from @entity22 after he signed a new three - year deal in the summer			0
his somewhat dour demeanour would perhaps not appeal to some fans and his reputation within these shores remains a little tainted by his experience with @entity29			0
@entity1 would also have to convince @entity9 to quit promotion - chasing @entity22			1
@entity61 : his name has been fairly well received			0
one criticism of @entity8 from the terraces was that the team lacked identity and , quite often , a game - plan			0
they see @entity9 as more methodical with a greater emphasis on tactics			0
@entity13 quit as manager of @entity73 side @entity14 at the end of last season and is currently without a club @entity13 current position : unemployed previous jobs : @entity14 @entity33 : @entity79 ( @entity14 ) reasons for : there would be no severance payment for starters given his decision to quit @entity14 at the end of last season			1
his knowledge of @entity73 – @entity1 ’s preferred hunting ground for new talent – is a big plus and he has the experience of 10 years at a top club in the roles of coach , assistant and manager			2
there is also no pre-existing relationships with the press , something @entity1 are keen to control , and he is familiar with the @entity103 following three years as a player with @entity105			0
former @entity14 head coach @entity13 , who previously played for @entity105 , is in line for the @entity1 job reasons against : @entity13 cited family reasons and a lack of energy as the motivation behind his decision to stand down as @entity14 boss			1
has he had time to recharge his batteries ? there is also the unknown element in @entity117 having never managed or coached outside of @entity12			0
@entity61 : it appears that @entity13 is well respected in his homeland and the @entity1 have spoken positively about the link			2
he also fits the the bill of continental head coach and this new model is something the @entity1 appear to have accepted			1
@entity13 ( left ) , with @entity125 and @entity126 , has @entity103 experience playing for @entity105			2

@entity8 left @entity1 to become @entity130 *'s* new manager
derby manager @entity9 and former @entity14 boss @entity13 lead the way as @entity1 look to appoint a new head coach rather than a manager
*caretaker* boss @entity136 claims he wants the job *permanently*
