by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 allayed fears over @entity5 after the @entity7 target sustained a shoulder injury that has threatened to scupper his prospects of a move from @entity11			1
the @entity13 striker , who has been the subject of an accepted £ 14million bid from @entity7 , was hurt in the ninth minute of @entity3 ’s 1 - 0 defeat to @entity17 at @entity18 following a collision with @entity20 and immediately received treatment on the touchline			1
@entity5 tried to continue but , moments later , he gestured to the bench that he could no longer continue and was forced to make a slow trudge around the pitch accompanied by one of @entity3 ’s medical staff , ensuring that he did not allow his right arm to leave his side			1
' it 's not as bad as first thought , ' said @entity2 , speaking after the game			2
' he has only bruised it			2
he will miss a few days			2
he wo n't train for the rest of the trip but it wo n't be anything serious and he will be okay			0
' as for his future , we will see			0
we have had a significant bid from a @entity53 club and it is something he is thinking about			0
' @entity5 will undergo further medical tests to ascertain the full extent of the damage and he knows from experience how damaging these problems can be as he dislocated his left shoulder in february 2013 and spent eight weeks out of action			1
concern : @entity3 's @entity5 receives treatment after falling awkwardly against @entity17 earlier on wednesday , @entity7 boss @entity64 said he was determined to bring @entity5 back to the club			1
he told the @entity66 : ‘ it is not for me to explain but it is not just a question of @entity5 wanting to come or not			0
there are many , many things to look at and unfortunately , i can not comment on those			0
‘ we are involved in negotiations and you never know how long that can take			0
there ’s nothing new to report as things stand , but we are still hoping to close the deal completely			0
commitment : @entity3 's @entity83 ( left ) battles with @entity85 of @entity17 ‘ it ’s up to @entity5			1
we have been clear , everything is fine , there ’s no doubt about his connection with our club , and me and him get along fine , so there is no reason for it not to happen			0
‘ i would love to know how long it will take to sort out , but all i can tell you is that things are changing every day			0
‘ we have targets that we are looking for , we have other options , but we have an agreement with @entity3 and we will do everything possible to get @entity5 to the club first			1
‘ if @entity5 does not come , it does not set us back , we would move on - we are not a one - player team			2
