by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 15:37 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 17:16 est , 5 august 2013 families with children who suffer from @entity5 , a rare genetic disease characterized by premature aging , gathered at the weekend in @entity8 , @entity9 , to share experiences about a condition that can typically leave them feeling isolated			1
people with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes , are of short stature , their eyes appear sunken , and they have an ' aged ' look			2
they can suffer from a raft of health issues more often found in the elderly including : vision loss , hearing loss , @entity25 ’s type symptoms ( tremors ) , hair loss , liver and kidney problems and dementia			0
some may develop bits of gray hair , wrinkled skin or high blood pressure			0
those with severe cases often live only a few years , while less severe onsets can affect people into their 40s			1
scientists are still searching for answers about the disease , estimated to affect one in 500,000 children but difficult to diagnose			1
@entity55 said she knew something was n't right with her baby , @entity57 , shortly after she was born , even though doctors said everything was fine			2
soon they found @entity57 had cataracts			0
they later found a problem with her nerve endings that made her itchy all the time			0
experts say children with @entity39 syndrome are mostly happy and jovial , despite their conditions @entity5 ( @entity5 ) is very rare disease resulting in slow growth in babies as well as rapid aging ( a form of progeria )			1
persons with this syndrome have smaller than normal head sizes , are of short stature , their eyes appear sunken , and they have an ' aged ' look			2
it is estimated to affect one in 500,000 children but difficult to diagnose			1
for @entity5 patients who are affected at birth , life expectancy is 3 – 7 years			1
other patients only start to show symptoms in early childhood and their life expectancy tends to be under 20 years			1
however , some rare @entity5 patients live significantly longer			1
individuals with @entity5 are extremely sensitive to the sunlight and sunburn easily so they mostly stay indoors during normal daylight hours			1
@entity5 is often described as a ' progeria - like syndrome '			1
@entity95 is an extremely rare genetic disease wherein symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age			1
one of the earliest influences of progeria on popular culture occurred in the 1922 short story @entity105 by @entity106 ( and later released as a feature film in 2008 staring @entity108 )			2
the main character , @entity109 , is born as a seventy - year - old man and ages backwards ; a scenario inspired by progeria			1
‘ slowly everything started to unravel as we discovered that she could n't hear and she was n't developing right , ' @entity114 said			0
' it took us five years before we were able to figure out that she had @entity39 syndrome			2
at that point , she was already close to the end of her lifespan			0
she died four months later			0
' ’ now @entity114 leads the @entity125 and @entity126 and organizes the conference each year for families to meet			1
she said the gatherings help because the disease can be isolating			2
a total of 43 @entity5 families from around the country and other parts of the world came together at the weekend for the 14th annual @entity137			1
because of the sensitivity of those children suffering from @entity5 , a night time outing was arranged on the @entity144 river cruise on the @entity145 for a tour of the @entity139 monuments lit up at night			1
two @entity5 suffers celebrated their birthday ’s during the event : @entity149 from @entity150 who turned 13 years old and @entity151 from @entity152 will celebrated his milestone birthday of 21 years old			1
for parents it was an opportunity to share tips on caring for their children with a raft of health needs			2
other discussions focused on helping the well siblings of @entity5 patients to cope with the day to day issues			1
while for kids with @entity5 it was a rare opportunity to meet others like themselves			1
scientists and researchers joined them to observe their symptoms and to search for ways to provide treatment			0
dr. @entity174 , a leading researcher and pediatrician who has treated children with @entity39 at @entity178 , and a handful of other researchers often attend the conferences to help them search for answers in recognizing and treating the disease			1
‘ once you 've seen a condition , it takes on a personal , memorable aspect to you and becomes easier to recognize ’ he said			0
‘ but if you 've never seen it before and you 're only relying on textbooks , it 's very hard to recognize something that you 've never seen before			0
’ the event was an opportunity for @entity5 suffers and their siblings to play together with other kids in the same situation genetic testing can detect mutations that cause the disease , but to diagnose the condition in a child , a doctor would have to suspect @entity39 in order to test the patient 's cells , experts said			1
many patients develop a distinct facial appearance , and some families self - diagnose their children and seek help			1
dr. @entity212 , an adjunct investigator and rare disease researcher at the @entity214 , developed a hypothesis that the brain disease is caused by cells that are n't making proteins they need to function normally			2
then the cells are prone to dying			0
@entity212 said meeting affected children over the past eight years sparked his interest in the rare condition			1
he said it has n't received much research focus or public attention			0
' i had learned about it in textbooks and seen pictures , but that 's not the same thing as seeing it , ' he said			0
' that had a big impact on me and made me want to study this and to do something to help these people			0
' over the years , he said he has observed the progression of the disease and listened to the parents ' observations			2
scientists are still searching for answers about the disease , estimated to affect one in 500,000 children but difficult to diagnose at this year 's conference in @entity249 , dr. @entity250 , a biochemistry professor at the @entity252 , conducted a blood draw for research funded by the @entity214 to try to determine what causes @entity39 syndrome			1
he is testing whether the children 's ' cells have the same protein symptoms as laboratory cells			2
' if they do , it might suggest new remedies that could actually be tried now , ' he said			0
a small biopharmaceutical company recently tried to develop a treatment but ran out of money			0
the treatment was never fully developed , @entity174 said			0
parents are anxious to know more about the disease			0
@entity271 of @entity272 , @entity273 , had three children with the syndrome and two healthy children			0
her first two children were never fully diagnosed with the condition before they died			0
now her 3 - month - old baby , @entity279 , her fifth child , also shows signs of the disease			0
' we still have n't ever had a piece of paper that says they have this			0
that would be nice to have , ' she said			0
' we know that they have it , but it would be nice just to have ( confirmation )			0
' the @entity293 : @entity5 is often described as a ' progeria - like syndrome ' , which inspired the 2008 feature film staring @entity108			2

@entity5 is a rare genetic disease characterized by premature aging
it affects 1 in 500,000 children but is difficult to diagnose
life expectancy is short for suffers and those kids born with it unlikely to live past 7 years of age
every year families of suffers come together to learn from their shared experience
