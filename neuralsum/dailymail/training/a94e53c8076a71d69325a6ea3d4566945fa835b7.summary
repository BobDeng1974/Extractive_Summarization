the chief executive of @entity1 has claimed that ' control was taken of ' @entity3 before it vanished			1
sir @entity4 said it was very important that the airline industry does not accept that the fate of @entity3 is an ' unexplained mystery ' his airline , @entity1 , operates almost 130 @entity11 aircraft , similar to the doomed jet			1
@entity3 vanished in march with 239 passengers and crew on board			1
personally , i have the concern that we will treat it as such and move on			0
at the most , it might then make an appearance on @entity37 as one of aviation 's great mysteries			2
we must n't allow this to happen			0
we must know what caused that airplane to disappear			0
the flight , which was travelling from @entity45 to @entity46 , has been missing since march 8 after veering dramatically off course			2
@entity47 lost all contact with the aircraft soon after it took off			2
air accident investigators are trying to determine why the aircraft 's transponders - which provide accurate location , speed and heading information - were switched off			1
for sir @entity4 , there is only one logical conclusion as to what happened to the highly advanced and reliable passenger jet			1
' @entity3 was , in my opinion , under control , probably until the very end			1
' the current search is concentrating on an area off the coast of @entity69 the @entity71 search vessel , pictured will spend a further year searching for the aircraft 's wreckage he said : ' my own view is that probably control was taken of that airplane			1
it 's anybody 's guess who did what			2
we need to know who was on the plane in the detail that obviously some people do know			0
we need to know what was in the hold of the aircraft			2
and we need to continue to press all those who were involved in the analysis of what happened for more information			0
' i do not subscribe to the view that the @entity11 , which is one of the most advanced in the world and has the most advanced communication platforms , needs to be improved with the introduction of some kind of additional tracking system			0
@entity3 should never have been allowed to enter a non-trackable situation			1
' sir @entity4 said it would be unlikely that the aircraft 's pilots would have been able to disable all the jet 's tracking equipment			1
the aircraft was fitted with a highly advanced system called @entity111 and @entity112 - which provides constant real - time information to the airline 's engineering staff			1
this system monitors the aircraft 's engines and can notify engineers of possible faults even before the pilots are aware of the situation			1
@entity122 lost contact with this system when the jet vanished			2
but for sir @entity4 , one of the most baffling elements of the mystery is the complete lack of any physical evidence of where the aircraft landed			1
he said not even a ' seat cushion ' has been recovered			0
he said : ' there has n't been one overwater incident in the history of civil aviation -- apart from @entity136 in 1939 -- that has not been at least 5 or 10 percent trackable			0
but @entity3 has simply disappeared			2
for me , that raises a degree of suspicion			0
i 'm totally dissatisfied with what has been coming out of all of this			0
' the hunt for @entity3 has resumed in a remote area of the @entity145 – more than six months after the jet disappeared			1
a ship with specialised sonar equipment , the @entity149 , is one of three that will spend up to a year hunting for the wreckage			2
it recently arrived in the search area 1,100 miles west of @entity69			0
the other two ships will join the hunt later this month			0
@entity3 vanished on march 8 during a flight from @entity45 to @entity46 , with 239 passengers and crew aboard			1
the search has been on hold for four months so crews could map the seabed in the search zone			0
investigators analysed transmissions between the plane and a satellite to narrow down the search area			0
however , a search zone described as the ‘ priority area ’ is still huge – an arc covering 23,000 square miles , which is the size of @entity174 .			0

sir @entity4 questions current thinking about the fate of flight *mh370*
sir @entity4 said if the jet crashed into the ocean then wreckage would be found
he said the somebody took control of the aircraft before it vanished
the @entity1 ceo said the industry must not accept @entity3 's a ' mystery '
