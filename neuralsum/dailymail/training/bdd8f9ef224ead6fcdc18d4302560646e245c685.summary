" ' in spite of @entity13 's declarations of grandeur , the conditions of @entity45 have been under a microscope in recent months since the prison warden resigned after the despicable treatment of prisoners with mental illnesses			1
@entity85 stepped down in november - coincidentally the day after @entity13 was sentenced - following the results of an investigation that showed mentally ill inmates being left unattended for weeks at a time and found in cells covered with human feces			2
the conditions in @entity13 's cell seem much more luxurious , however , and he boasted about his free government health care in the letter			1

‘ i implore your great organization to pressure mr. @entity47 until he gives @entity143 her day in court in the interest of justice , ’ @entity13 ’s letter said			0
