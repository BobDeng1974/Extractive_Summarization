it may not be long before we see his arms wiggling in celebration again			0
@entity5 is on the cusp of a return for @entity8			1
@entity11 is understandably thrilled about the return from injury of his 25 - year - old striker , who has travelled to @entity15 with the squad for tuesday night ’s @entity17 semi-final against @entity19			1
the @entity8 manager is yet to reveal whether @entity5 is fit enough for a place on the bench , but if selected in the squad expect him to play some part			1
either way , the match against @entity25 on saturday will definitely see his presence , @entity11 has said			0
@entity5 is back in training after recovering from long - term thigh and calf injuries @entity11 ( centre ) hopes the striker 's return can push @entity8 towards a @entity36 finish the @entity38 striker speaks with captain @entity39 ( right ) during the training session @entity5 ( left ) could return for the @entity17 showdown with @entity19 after sitting out the first leg it is difficult to underestimate the impact he might have – even after nearly five months out with thigh and calf injuries			1
this , after all , is a player whose goals earned @entity8 more points last season than the strikes of @entity54			1
@entity5 scored 21 times in the @entity56 to secure his team 20 points			2
@entity54 found the net on 31 occasions to directly gain 16 points			2
those two stand top of last season ’s table highlighting that measurement			0
@entity68 ’s 15 @entity67 goals affected 12 points , @entity71 ’s 16 goals did likewise for @entity72 , while @entity73 scored 14 times to win @entity19 10 points			1
it really was a phenomenal contribution by @entity5			0
even this season , his solitary goal earned victory against @entity80 : two extra points			2
@entity5 's goals earned more points ( 20 ) than his @entity8 strike partner @entity54 ( 16 ) last season @entity5 also earned his team more points than ( @entity87 ) @entity68 , @entity71 and @entity73 @entity8 fans are excited , certainly , but also a little anxious			1
we have had false dawns before with @entity5 , who was in training on sunday			0
he has not appeared for his club since august 31 in the 3 - 0 win at @entity94			0
@entity95 played him for 89 minutes of @entity38 ’s friendly win over @entity97 three days later then had him in the training session which saw @entity5 suffer a thigh strain originally expected to keep him out for three weeks			2
@entity11 and @entity95 traded words over the circumstances of that training session and @entity5 ’s problems but whatever the root cause , he is only now ready to make a come back – and not before time			0
since he was initially ruled out @entity8 have stuttered , @entity11 has come under greater scrutiny than before , and @entity39 has announced his departure from the club			0
@entity5 has been sidelined for nearly five months after initially picking up a thigh injury on @entity38 duty @entity5 has not played since @entity8 beat @entity94 3 - 0 away on august 31 @entity8 ’s @entity36 campaign was utterly underwhelming and the lethargic style of play , coming after last season ’s swashbuckling approach , drew serious concern			1
@entity8 ’s season has shown flickers of life recently , though			2
unbeaten in 10 matches since defeat at @entity121 , tuesday night ’s match at @entity123 could provide a platform for the first silverware of the season			0
@entity5 ’s return may even provide a psychological lift from the sidelines			2
in the table , @entity8 are five points adrift of the @entity36 places , remarkable given their look of desperation at stages and largely down to lacklustre performances by teams above			2
could @entity5 provide the kickstart to ensure this season ends with a positive charge ? @entity8 earned an average of 2.2 points a game with @entity5 playing last season , but only 1.7 points without him in the side the 25 - year - old performs his trademark goal celebration during a pre-season friendly with @entity150 the statistics suggest so			1
in the 32 @entity56 games @entity5 has played since the start of last season , @entity8 have won 68.80 per cent , averaging 2.2 points per game , losing just four			1
in the same period @entity8 have won just 50 per cent of their 28 games without @entity5 , averaging 1.7 points per game and losing nine times			1
when @entity5 plays @entity8 score considerably more – 2.6 goals per game compared to 1.8 without him			1
clearly , this data is boosted by the @entity163 who headed to @entity165 last summer , but @entity5 more than played his part and will add a clinical element to @entity8 ’s game			1
too often , with @entity171 and @entity172 faltering , this has been lacking			0
@entity173 shouldered that responsibility before and since his mid-season break – and while his centre - forward role is an interesting development ( realised fully in that moment he tore @entity19 ’s defence apart to score at @entity179 ) you sense a deeper position would prove more damaging to opponents			0
@entity173 , scoring against @entity19 , has taken over striker responsibilities in @entity5 's absence ( @entity87 ) @entity185 , @entity172 and @entity171 have not weighed in with the goals with @entity54 gone , @entity5 injured , and @entity39 heading into the @entity188 sunset , @entity173 has been a lightening rod for @entity8 ’s expectations			1
@entity5 returning should remove some of that mental pressure and also allow the 20 - year - old to operate in his natural place on the pitch			0
imagine @entity173 picking up the ball consistently from advanced midfield and running at defenders – as he did when dropping deep in the first leg of this semi-final			0
@entity173 and @entity5 are on the same wavelength , quick feet and quick brains , and goals should flow			0
a new sas in the making ? with a fight on four fronts still , @entity11 will hope so .			0

@entity5 has been out for nearly five months through injury
@entity8 striker could return against @entity19 in the @entity17
@entity38 *international* 's goals last season earned more points than @entity54 , @entity68 , @entity71 and @entity73
