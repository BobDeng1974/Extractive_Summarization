@entity4 , whose fortune is estimated to be around $ 100milllion , was stripped of his seven @entity10 titles last year and banned for life after the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) ruled he had been at the heart of ' the most sophisticated , professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen '			1
but now a string of sporting bodies are lining up to demand he pay back millions of dollars he has won in prize and bonus money over his career in the wake of his sensational ' doping ' admission to be aired this week			1
' at the end of the day , i would be surprised if the damages - total amount - are n’t in the tens of millions of dollars , ' @entity23 , a @entity24 lawyer who has represented professional athletes in civil cases , told @entity32			1
scroll down for first look at the interview			1

already the organisation that runs the @entity10 has demanded that @entity4 pay back almost $ 4million it awarded him for his wins , while insurance firm @entity47 wants back $ 12million in bonus payouts it covered in 2002 , 2003 and 2005			1
the @entity51 - based @entity50 also is suing @entity4 to recover about $ 500,000 it paid him to settle a libel lawsuit			1

refunds : @entity4 's admission could now lead to a string of lawsuits demanding refunds of the millions he has won over his career in prize and bonus money , while potential defamation actions by critics he viciously attacked are also possible demands : the organisation that runs the @entity10 has demanded that @entity4 pay back almost $ 4 million it awarded him for his wins , while insurance firm , @entity47 , wants back $ 12 million in bonuses federal authorities have closed their 20 - month probe for possible criminal charges over the doping allegations after investigators unearthed no illegal practice			1
while taking performance - enhancing drugs is not a criminal offence , they may have been looking for evidence of trafficking , fraud and perjury , @entity32 reported			1
but experts suggest that that investigation could be re-opened in the wake of @entity4 's explosive interview on @entity5			1
@entity88 , a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in @entity90 , told @entity32 : ' mr. @entity4 is very well - advised by capable lawyers and i do n’t think he would be admitting on the @entity93 show something that would give rise to a criminal charge			1
' the @entity12 deposed 11 former teammates and accused @entity4 of masterminding a complex and brazen drug program that included steroids , blood boosters and a range of other performance - enhancers			2

if successful , the suit could force @entity4 , and others , to repay that money plus $ 60 million in damages , 30 per cent of which would go to @entity116			2
it comes after the @entity130 yesterday said that @entity4 must confess under oath to seek a reduction in his lifetime ban from sports for taking performance enhancing drugs during seven @entity10 victories			2
@entity130 says it ' read with interest media reports suggesting a television ' confession ' made by @entity4 ' to talk show host @entity93 on monday			2
@entity4 reportedly hopes to return to competition in recognised triathlon events			1
however , @entity130 says ' only when mr @entity4 makes a full confession under oath — and tells the anti-doping authorities all he knows about doping activities — can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence '			2
