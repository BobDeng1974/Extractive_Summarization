it took @entity1 two months to go from the nadir of her @entity4 embarrassment to @entity6 champion in two months , emphatically claiming her 18th @entity6 title on sunday night			1
the 32 year - old @entity8 equalled the @entity10 tally of @entity11 and @entity12 by overcoming an edgy @entity13 in the @entity15 final 6 - 3 6 - 3 in 75 minutes , reconfirming her position as the world 's number one player			1
after collapsing on the court in delight and trying , and failing , to surpress her emotion , she was presented by the two legends with an eighteen carat gold bracelet from @entity24 's marking the achievement			0
next stop is the total of 22 slam titles won by @entity29			1
it was the biggest single prize in tennis history			0
this was a far cry from her @entity4 departure , when a ' viral illness ' saw her having to default from the doubles after losing all co-ordination			0
she felt the key to recovery was the way she was able to re-dedicate herself after that by playing a heavy schedule leading in here : ' i think playing in all those tournaments really helped me , it gave me the calmness i needed as well , ' she said			0
' i practised so hard , in fact i 've been practising hard for six months and that has really showed today			0
i was really tight and nervous , getting to eighteen has been on my shoulders for a long time			0
that probably weighed more than winning a sixth @entity15			1
i never thought my name would be up with those legends , that 's why i 'm quite emotional			0
' finding form : @entity13 was in much - improved form as she blasted her way into the final going for broke : @entity1 shows her agility to return a forehand at full - stretch and off balance on a high : @entity1 has won her home major six time and the last three tournaments consecutively taking it all in : @entity1 lays on the court at the @entity98 after her emphatic win leveller : @entity1 has caught @entity11 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) on 18 @entity6 titles @entity13 could not rouse herself to end this highly testing personal summer on a triumphant note , unable to match the firepower of her opponent , who successfully put their friendship to one side			1
that was always going to be the case as these two have been trained from so young to be ruthless on court , so no quarter was given in an ultimately disappointing contest			0
' you 're an unbelievable friend and you owe me drinks later , ' said @entity13 afterwards , in a nice touch of old school			1
in truth perhaps their relationship may have marred the quality of the encounter , rather in the way many @entity1 versus @entity126 matches have also been flat			1
unless @entity1 suffered one of her @entity6 implosions the 24 year - old @entity127 probably needed a policy of all out aggression to come off , and by the time she started to execute a more attacking game it was too late			1
aside from three aces , @entity13 's first winner on her stronger backhand side did not come until the last game of the match , and by this time the defending champion was playing much better			2
it has still been a fine effort from the @entity127 to pick herself from the trauma of her cancelled engagement , and a reward will be a return to the top 10			0
close friends : @entity13 and @entity1 , pals off the court , embrace after the match standing on ceremony : @entity8 @entity153 hold a giant @entity8 flag ahead of the women 's singles final legends : @entity1 and @entity13 pose for a pre-match photo with @entity8 tennis legend @entity159 @entity1 was already the oldest ever women 's @entity15 champion coming into this , and even just short of her 33rd birthday she had still conceded only 26 games , an indication of her how strong her form has been			1
in the lead - in to this tournament she had twice beaten the resurgent @entity13 , who is yet to beat a number one player now in five attempts			1
@entity1 was attempting to ensure that this would not be the first season since 2001 that she finished up without a @entity6 when having entered all four of them - and that duly turned out to be the case			1
@entity176 had begun the morning by tweeting @entity177 ( seize the day ) , and while he might have been referring to himself playing in @entity178 the romantic in you would like to believe there could have been a coded message in there			0
unfortunately there was little sign of it initially as @entity1 saved an early break point with an ace , and then the @entity127 sent down two double faults to go behind an immediate break			2
clearly nervous , she struggled with her first serve throughout the first set , but it was the erratic nature of her forehand that was damaging her the most and , although @entity1 was not at her punishing best , it was quite enough			2
she broke three times to win the first set , despite having her own problems and being broken twice herself			2
an early break put distance between them in the second , and although the overall quality of the match picked up a @entity1 victory was never in doubt			2
the younger sibling is an extraordinary athlete			0
the most baffling thing is that she did not get past the fourth round in any other of this season ' s majors .			0

@entity1 beat @entity13 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in the @entity15 final
it took @entity1 just 75 minutes to overcome her close friend in @entity50
she has now won her home major six times : 1999 , 2002 , 2008 , 2012 - 2014
@entity1 has 18 career slams , level with @entity11 and @entity12
only @entity29 has more major trophies to her name with 22
