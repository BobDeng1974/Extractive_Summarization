by @entity0 the key to this series will be whether @entity4 ’s seamers manage to bowl as well as their @entity7 counterparts did in @entity8 recently			1
we all know what superb batsmen @entity4 have , but the problems they have had winning overseas tests in the past three years have stemmed from their inability to take 20 wickets			1
and that places a huge onus on the likes of @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			0
even when they lost here 4 - 0 three years ago , @entity33 enjoyed success by pitching the ball up			0
but if their frontline trio — plus @entity39 , if he plays — fails to fire this time , they could be in trouble			0
looking at this @entity8 batting line - up , there is an obvious approach @entity4 can take , because so many of the batsmen like to hang back — @entity24 , @entity27 and @entity46			1
even @entity47 , who tries to get forward , has been vulnerable to the fuller delivery			0
the days when you had four different styles in @entity24 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are gone			1
now , if you pitch the ball up in the right place — just outside off - stump — five times every over , you ’ll have a chance against all of these back - foot players			0
@entity4 could do worse than take a leaf out of @entity61 ’s book			1
the @entity7 arrived here with an unheralded seam attack of @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , but they ended up bowling better lengths than @entity8 ’s seamers , even at @entity70			1
while @entity4 ’s coach @entity72 may still have concerns about his bowling attack , he will not have any at all about the batsmen			1
when he first took the job three years ago , he was aware of the batting talent that was coming through — and @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 are a joy to watch			0
sometimes when you watch overseas players , you fear for their techniques in @entity86 conditions			0
but these guys seem to be the complete package			0
and the amazing thing is that they want to keep getting better			0
concerns : @entity4 coach @entity72 may be worried about his bowling attack for the series star : @entity80 is the new name of @entity96 cricket following the retirement of @entity98 since the retirement of @entity98 , @entity80 has probably passed @entity99 as the biggest name in @entity96 cricket , yet he has the demeanour of a player who wants to learn as much as he can			1
good is n’t good enough : he wants to be great			0
i ’m not expecting him or @entity79 to settle for any flashy 40s or 50s in this series : they will want to bat big			2
and that could hurt @entity8			2
the reality is , though , that both sides go into this series low on confidence			2
@entity4 have not won any of their past 14 away @entity114 and are not used to playing five - @entity114 series , while @entity8 have n’t won any of their past eight — either home or away			1
you would expect @entity8 to start as favourites , but then we said that against @entity61			2
the key for @entity8 will be for @entity24 to get all the individual performances we saw against the @entity7 to mould into a match - winning team effort			1
it ’s up to @entity4 ’s seamers to stop him .			2

@entity24 , @entity27 and @entity26 amongst those that need to perform with the bat for @entity8
@entity4 *'s* bowlers under *pressure* to take wickets away from home
@entity8 to face @entity4 in five @entity114 series this *summer*
