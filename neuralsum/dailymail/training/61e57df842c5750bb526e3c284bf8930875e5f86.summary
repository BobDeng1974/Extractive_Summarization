by @entity0 and @entity1 she normally shies away from even having the merest sip of wine in public			0
but there was something about being north of the border yesterday that put the @entity8 – using her @entity10 title the @entity11 – in the mood for a wee dram			2
@entity8 and her husband , also given the title @entity11 by the @entity16 on his marriage , were on a visit to the country ’s oldest distillery , @entity21 , home to the @entity23 , when they decided to enter into the , er , spirit of things with a little whisky tasting			1
@entity8 wisely declined , but had another sip of her glass of @entity88			0
‘ i ’ll stick with that girlie one , ’ she laughed , but also tried two of the other blends			0
it was the couple ’s first public engagement together since their successful tour of @entity96 and @entity97			0
@entity8 was wearing a long red coat by @entity99 – no risk of a bottom - bearing incident – a dress by @entity103 and a @entity105 brooch given to her as a wedding present			1
after the tasting at @entity111 - based @entity110 , the couple enjoyed a civic reception and lunch , but there was still more drinking to do			0
at their last engagement of the day , the @entity116 , @entity8 was asked to try a sip of gin from the @entity120			2
she gamely downed it , saying : ‘ it ’s delicious , ’ but added : ‘ i had better not drink too much because of all the whisky i drank at @entity21			0
’ the pair were then shown around the bunting - festooned stalls at the village fete by @entity54 , lord @entity53 , who is the scion of the @entity54 whiskey dynasty , and @entity129 , the founder of @entity130 and an artist in her own right			2

also at the fete was the glamorous lady @entity168 , the daughter of the @entity169 and who was once dubbed ' the most beautiful girl in @entity50 ' by society magazine , @entity173			0
but this time around , all eyes were on the @entity8 who looked chic in a crimson coat by @entity99 , which she teamed with a matching dress by @entity103			1
a-list favourite goat , which counts @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 among fans , has made a name for itself as a go - to label for understated luxury with a sophisticated aesthetic - all of which made it perfect for the @entity8 , who is still reeling after a @entity189 tabloid printed a photograph of her bottom earlier this week			2
clearly intent on putting the controversy behind her , the @entity8 played it safe with the rest of her ensemble which included a pair of her favourite @entity199 ' @entity198 ' court shoes and a delicate silver brooch in the shape of a @entity105 knot			1
earlier , the @entity8 , with husband @entity58 by her side , had beamed as she accepted a dram after being shown how @entity205 is made during a tour of the @entity31 in @entity207			1
giggling madly , the royal couple were asked to pour themselves a shot of whisky from one of the huge barrels before going on to a reception where they met local worthies			0

the @entity51 and @entity8 , who are known as the @entity11 and @entity266 north of the border , were making their first public appearance as a couple since returning from the hugely successful tour of @entity97 and @entity96			2
