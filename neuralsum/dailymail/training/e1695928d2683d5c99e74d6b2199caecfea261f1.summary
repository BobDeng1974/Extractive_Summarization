half of @entity3 's richest hedge - fund millionaires have given cash to the @entity5 , new figures have revealed			1
of the 59 wealthiest city managers , 27 have ploughed £ 19million into the @entity8 ' election war - chest - with £ 10million flowing into the party 's coffers since 2010 alone			1
the revelations come after @entity12 yesterday repeatedly challenged the prime minister over the @entity5 's links to the @entity6			1
@entity5 donors and hedge fund managers ( from left to right ) @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 the @entity21 leader accused mr @entity22 of failing to close tax loopholes because he was ' bankrolled by hedge funds '			1
he drew attention to the government 's decision in 2013 to abolish a little known tax on investment funds , which @entity21 has described as a £ 145m ' hedge fund tax cut '			1
the @entity21 leader claimed : ' this is a prime minister who wo n't tackle tax avoidance for the simple reason that too many of his friends would get caught in the net			1
' they are the party of @entity40 hedge funds and @entity42 tax avoiders and under him you will always know it 's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everyone else			1
' the wealthiest hedge fund manager last year , according to @entity51 , was @entity52 , 50 , of the @entity54 fund , with an estimated personal net worth of £ 1.6billion			1
mr @entity52 has contributed £ 116,000 to the @entity5 party			2
but the two biggest hedge funds donors were @entity17 of @entity58 , a metals trader , who has donated £ 6.5million to the @entity8 and sir @entity18 of @entity62 's biggest hedge fund , @entity61 , who has given £ 3.2m			1
other significant hedge fund donors were @entity65 , the party 's former co-treasurer , who has donated £ 3.2million to the @entity5 party and the secretive @entity68 , also of @entity54 , who has donated £ 1.3million			2
at prime minister 's questions , @entity22 and @entity12 clashed in the @entity71 over tax avoidance @entity17 , @entity58 worth : £ 150m donated : £ 6,556,092 sir @entity18 , @entity61 worth : £ 1.05bn donated : £ 3,221,027 lord @entity19 , @entity73 worth : £ 130m donated : £ 3,172,007 @entity68 , @entity54 worth : £ 230m donated : £ 1,344,850 @entity74 , @entity75 worth : £ 350m donated : £ 1,226,411 @entity76 , vice-chair of @entity21 's general election campaign , accused the prime minister of ' debasing political debate ' by refusing to answer questions over his hedge fund backers			1
she told the @entity82 : ' the @entity8 are standing up for those at the top rather than hardworking families , and @entity22 does n't want to admit it			1
' the conservatives later claimed that closing the stamp duty loophole would hurt pension funds , rather than penalise hedge funds			1
mr @entity22 accused the @entity21 of failing to act on tax avoidance during its 13 years in office			1
he told mr @entity12 : ' when we came to office foreigners did n't pay stamp duty on the properties they bought			2
foreigners did n't pay capital gains tax on the properties they bought			2
' and because of your tax rates @entity6 hedge fund managers were paying lower tax rates than the people who cleaned their offices			2
that 's what we had to sort out			0
' the row over accepting money from wealthy donors comes after the archbishop of @entity113 hit out at tax dodging companies looking to increase profits by not paying their fair share			2
the @entity119 @entity118 said companies and people should pay their ' fair share ' in the country where they had made their money , but part of the problem was an ' unbelievably complex ' tax system			2
the remarks will be seen as a highly political intervention after mr @entity22 and mr @entity12 clashed in the @entity71 over tax avoidance			1
dr @entity118 , a former oil executive , said business was important and should be supported but there was a temptation to misuse the power that came through wealth			0
he told the @entity136 : ' there has always been the principle that you pay tax where you earn the money			0
if you earn money in a particular country , the revenue service of that country needs to get a fair share of what you have earned			0
' highlighting the complexities of the international tax system , he said : ' someone said the other day that the tax system was of biblical proportions			0
well , the @entity154 's only a thousand pages - how many tax systems are only a thousand pages ? they are several hundred times that			0
' there needs to be simplification in tax so that people are responsible in the right place			0
' he added that there was a ' very basic principle ' that ' as a @entity166 we see that @entity167 spoke of , about the importance of people paying what is due '			0
' the @entity154 speaks of it endlessly , ' he said			0
the @entity119 @entity118 said companies and people should pay their ' fair share ' in the country where they had made their money it is the archbishop 's latest intervention on economic matters , having spoken out about inequality in recent weeks			0
he stressed that ' business is important ' , adding : ' we need to affirm the significance of those who generate and create wealth , but we also need to be realistic about the fact ... that with wealth comes power and with power comes a temptation to misuse power			0
' there 's a reality of the human condition , of what @entity166 call sin , what the @entity154 calls sin , which says do n't misuse the power you have got through wealth			0
' asked whether some people were doing that he said : ' there 's always elements where that happens , because people are people			0
' but the response to that was not to ' throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that business is bad ' - instead , ' solidarity ' and an improved regulatory framework were required .			0
