by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:56 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 06:09 est , 11 november 2013 @entity2 ' ' 60 minutes ' apologized for a second time on sunday 's broadcast for reporting a false version of the 2012 attack on the @entity8 mission in @entity9 , @entity10 , and for the untruthful source who claimed to have been at the event			1
@entity14 was the reporter responsible for the @entity15 on air story with uncredited source @entity17			2
after his interview with reporter @entity21 aired on the show , his account began being questioned publicly by the @entity23 and the @entity24			1
though ' 60 minutes ' initially stood by him - believing his claims that he was the subject of a slander attack by the @entity29 - they issued a public apology for their mistake on the following friday			2
@entity17 previously worked as a security contractor hired by the @entity29 and he told 60 minutes that he was not on the ground of the @entity36 when the attack began on the night of september 11 , 2012 , but he rushed over as soon as he heard			1
@entity21 on ' @entity38 ' on sunday where she recounts a false broadcast on @entity15 and issues an apology ' @entity38 ' correspondent @entity21 made a second apology on air for trusting an untruthful source ‘ the most important thing to every person at 60 minutes is the truth , and today the truth is we made a mistake			1
that 's very disappointing for any journalist , that 's very disappointing for me , ’ @entity14 said when she gave an on - air mea culpa during @entity46 on november 8			2
‘ nobody likes to admit that they made a mistake , but if you do , you have to stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong and in this case we were wrong			0
’ during the original interview , @entity17 - who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events , @entity63 - said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack			1
apology on nov.8 : @entity21 said that they were wrong to air her interview with a man called @entity17 who , it has since been revealed , lied about his role on the night of the attacks on the @entity8 mission to @entity9 multiple stories : @entity17 , who went by the pseudonym @entity63 during the interview , told his security company and the @entity84 something different than he told @entity2 during his interview that aired at the end of october he also said that he later saw the body of ambassador @entity88 when he went to a local hospital that evening			1
it was later revealed that in reports he made both to his company , @entity94 , and the @entity84 , he said that he never made it to the compound on the night of the attack			2
he said in those reports that he never made it to the @entity101 compound until the next morning on september 12			0
@entity14 said that they were aware of the discrepancy between the version of events that he was telling @entity2 and the @entity94 report , saying that before they aired the piece he told them that he lied in the company ’s report to go along with his boss ’ story which said that @entity17 tried going to the mission but there were roadblocks and he could n’t make it			1
lies : @entity17 told 60 minutes that he scaled a 12 - foot wall to get into the compound and then fought a terrorist to the ground once he got inside			1
he also said he saw the dead body of the @entity8 ambassador ‘ his boss is someone he cared about enormously			2
he cared about his @entity8 counterparts in the mission that night , and when his boss told him not to go , he could n't stay back			2
so that was always part of the record for us , ’ @entity14 said			0
she made it clear that what they did not know was that @entity17 had given that account to the @entity84 in their incident report			1
his involvement with the @entity84 report came via the @entity23 after the 60 minutes piece aired , and @entity14 said that when they confronted him over the claims , he denied it			2
@entity14 said that they have since tried contacting @entity17 about the situation and they have not been able to get in touch with him			0
‘ we were misled and we were wrong and that 's the important thing and that 's what we have to say here : we have to set the record straight and take responsibility , ’ she said			0
placing the blame : while she repeatedly said @entity38 was taking responsibility , she said that they were ' misled ' by @entity17 who did not tell them that he gave a different version of events to the @entity84 @entity17 motivation to lie presumably has something to do with the fact that he is coming out with a book about alleged warnings that he gave the @entity8 government about security flaws before the attack			1
the publisher of the book , @entity171 , has now said that they have retracted the book			0
pulled : the publisher announced on friday that it will stop selling @entity176 ' book it had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book			0
@entity182 announced that ' in light of information that has been brought to our attention ' they will no longer be selling the book			0
anyone who purchased the book in the past week since the story aired and it went on the market can now return it to the publisher , @entity188 reports			0
the book itself was another problem for ' @entity38 ' because while they did disclose that @entity17 had a book that was being published , they failed to mention that @entity198 is an imprint of @entity182 which is owned by @entity2			1
@entity200 said that they got a statement from @entity17 who said that his book is ' consistent ' with what he told @entity8 authorities and the @entity84 , but their own reporter said that there were discrepancies between his book and official reports			1
when asked about what steps they took to vet that @entity17 was telling the truth before they put him on air , @entity14 said that they did independent research and also used material that he provided			0
' we verified that he was who he said he was , that he was working for the @entity29 at the time , that he was in @entity9 at the @entity101 compound the night of the attack , ' she said on @entity2 ' morning news show			1
' he gave us access to communications that he had with government officials			0
we used @entity8 government reports and congressional testimony to verify many of the details of his story and everything checked out			0
he also showed us photographs that he had taken at the @entity101 compound the following morning			0
' watch the video here			0

@entity38 aired an interview with a security contractor who claimed to rush over to the @entity8 consulate after the attack began in 2012
after the interview with @entity17 aired , @entity2 learned that @entity17 told the @entity84 a different version of events
now @entity2 has apologized for being ' misled ' twice - once on nov. 8 and another time on sunday
publishing house that *planned* to publish @entity17 ' book has now cancelled
