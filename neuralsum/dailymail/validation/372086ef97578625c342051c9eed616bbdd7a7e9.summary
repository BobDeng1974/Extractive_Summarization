@entity0 could n’t understand what all the fuss was about			1
asked by a @entity6 journalist to explain the ‘ story ’ of his sledgehammer tackle on @entity9 , the @entity4 lock was non-plussed			1
‘ there ’s not much of a story really , ’ he said , in reference to the incident at @entity12 last saturday			1
‘ that ’s just what i do			1
’ @entity4 lock @entity0 made a trademark hit on @entity19 fly - half @entity9 @entity0 certainly made sure that ‘ @entity22 ’ lived up to its billing , but @entity19 were incensed			1
two days later , it emerged that they had cited the @entity26 player , but the match commissioner was satisfied that the officials , led by referee @entity29 , had been right to take no action			1
this episode generated enormous interest and debate , and served to highlight an issue that rugby is currently faced with ; how to find the balance between embracing its extreme physicality , or fretting about it			1
footage of @entity0 levelling his opponent – complete with countless replays – was prominently displayed on the @entity43 website and , as of thursday , it had received in excess of 963,000 ' hits ' ( an appropriate term in this case ) on @entity47			1
there is no doubt that monster collisions are part of the game ’s box - office appeal			1
the sight of huge men smashing each other and accepting the punishment with minimal complaint is one factor that sets the sport apart from most others			1
but officials are also wary about being seen to glorify brutality , even when it falls within the laws			1
concussion remains a hot topic			1
the threat of legal intervention hangs heavy			1
scrum sequences have been amended in the quest for greater safety			1
@entity72 – in terms of vigorous use of feet – has been outlawed			1
punch - ups are a fading phenomenon			1
a crusade against so - called dangerous tackling continues ; so aerial contests for the ball have become a grey area of unrest and confusion			2
the @entity6 players and public were incensed with the monster hit in @entity43 clash in the age of ‘ super slo - mo ’ replays , acts of aggression such as the one by @entity0 appear worse or more impressive than in real - time , depending on your viewpoint			1
frame by frame , the size and force of modern rugby is being laid bare , and the powers - that - be worry about parents of the next generation of players taking fright and directing their children towards other sports			2
as severe injuries occur with alarming frequency , the constant gaze of countless cameras means there is no hiding from the fact that this is a tough game , with inherent risks			1
but in different ways , it was ever thus			2
this is not an activity played in cotton wool			2
@entity123 can not be fully sanitised for mass consumption , or it will lose its warrior soul			2
@entity127 rugby has been rocked by a homophobia controversy , which could have profound ramifications			2
during a super 15 clash between the @entity131 and @entity132 in @entity133 last weekend , the visitors ’ vice-captain , @entity134 , twice complained to referee @entity136 about homophobic abuse by an opponent			2
days later , the @entity131 ’ flanker , @entity139 , was fined and apologised for using inappropriate language			2
@entity134 twice complained to referee @entity136 about homophobic abuse the episode has divided opinion @entity143 , with many acclaiming @entity134 – a staunch supporter of gay rights – for taking a stand , while others have complained that the issue should not have been so publicly exposed			2
the esteemed openside has captained his country before and could do so again at the @entity152 , but there is a suspicion that he may have removed himself from the running , with one commentator saying : ‘ he ’ll pay for it			2
it will mean that he never captain the @entity159 again			0
’ the man who will make that call , @entity159 coach @entity162 , also happens to be coach of the @entity131 , but he is adamant the saga will not harm @entity134 ’s leadership prospects			0
meanwhile , there are fears of a possible split between @entity131 and @entity132 contingents in the @entity159 camp			0
@entity131 flanker @entity139 ( centre ) apologised for using inappropriate language fresh from the success of their young team , led by the outstanding @entity4 prospect , @entity178 , in last sunday ’s @entity179 , @entity173 are hoping to mark the return of the @entity181 this weekend by beating their own world record for a club rugby attendance			0
advance ticket sales have passed the current record figure of 83,889 , for saturday 's showdown with @entity188 rivals harlequins at @entity189			0
however , while that fixture provides the glamorous backdrop , @entity191 ’s encounter with @entity192 at @entity193 has the most significance in terms of the league table			0
the @entity199 are second but sit just two points ahead of the fifth - placed @entity191 , and saturday 's match will be a fascinating test of the @entity205 club ’s credentials as genuine title challengers			0
saracens prepare for saturday 's @entity181 encounter against @entity209 at @entity189 there must be something about playing prop for @entity4 that unleashes the inner performing artist in otherwise quiet , even shy characters			0
after the victory over @entity19 at @entity12 , @entity191 ’s @entity215 delivered a stirring rendition of ‘ @entity218 ’ in front of a large audience , to mark his 50th @entity222 cap			0
a video of his animated efforts has become a sensation on the internet			0
@entity215 is following in a proud recent tradition			0
@entity228 is a much - lauded rapper , who is known for his improvised lyrics , to herald famous victories			0
@entity231 combined being @entity4 ’s scrum destroyer - in - chief for several years with producing country and western albums , while @entity235 appeared on celebrity x-factor , to showcase his crooning quality			0
last word six days on from ‘ @entity240 ’ , after taking stock , the conclusion is unchanged ; that it was the greatest day of drama in the long history of the championship , and the magnitude of the events was felt far beyond rugby ’s usual constituencies			0
at the peak , during @entity4 v @entity19 , the @entity249 reported viewing figures just shy of 10 million			0
this follows the revelation that the @entity43 board will consider switching to pay - tv after the current rights deal expires in 2017			1
such a move would be utter lunacy			0
tournament organisers and the unions must recognise that the wide exposure delivered by a terrestrial broadcaster is worth far more than whatever large sums are on offer			0
the likes of @entity267 and @entity268 provide superb coverage , but this annual surge of public interest is priceless for rugby			0
meanwhile , in the aftermath of the championship ’s epic finale , this column would recognise the merit of a bonus - point scheme , providing an extra five points were awarded for a @entity280			0
and as for a @entity282 nomination , look no further than @entity283 – colossal captain of triumphant @entity285 .			0
