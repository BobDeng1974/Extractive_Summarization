the @entity0 can be a daunting prospect at the best of times , even for a confident young driver			1
so it ’s perhaps not surprising that 82 - year - old @entity5 got rather lost amid its four - lane carriageways and busy junctions			1
however , he managed to disappear for an epic 30 hours behind the wheel			1
@entity5 was reported missing after failing to arrive at his destination 55 miles away			1
he was found 30 hours later boarded up : mr @entity5 's home in @entity12 yesterday he set off from his home in @entity12 on monday evening to visit his daughter @entity14 55 miles away in @entity15 in @entity16			1
it was a route he apparently knew well and had travelled several times before			1
a few hours later his worried family reported him missing			1
the next day at 11.20am his silver @entity21 estate was spotted on a police automatic recognition camera in @entity24 , @entity16 – six miles from his intended destination			2
the @entity0 celebrated its 25th birthday in october , despite first being proposed in 1905			2
it runs for 117 miles and almost encircles @entity28			2
when it was first built it was the world 's biggest ring road / city bypass but now it is second to the @entity32 which is 121 miles long			2
the @entity0 took more than 11 years to complete and cost around £ 1billion			2
if people were to drive at 70mph it would take an hour and 40 minutes to complete the route			1
however , those in need of refreshments would need to carefully plan their stops as there are only three service stations along the entire length of the motorway			2
despite being designed with a capacity of 100,000 vehicles per day , almost double that figure now use it daily			2
the motorway inspired @entity49 's 1989 hit road to @entity50 and is also the inspiration behind the name of electronic duo @entity53			0
it appeared the former carpenter was lost on the 117 - mile @entity28 orbital and going around in circles			1
@entity58 put out a missing person ’s appeal and called on other forces to help			0
then in the early hours of wednesday – more than 30 hours after going missing – a ‘ confused but grateful ’ mr @entity5 and his car were found safe in @entity63			1
@entity64 said he was in hospital last night , believed to be having treatment for hypothermia after his two nights out in the cold in his car			0
a @entity58 spokesman said : ‘ he had been driving around the south of the country , predominantly on the @entity0 but had also gone on to some a roads in the area			0
he had stopped to catch up on some much needed sleep – we think in a motorway service area , before setting off again			0
he is , after all , 82			1
’ mr @entity5 has lived alone at his semi-detached home since the death of his wife @entity81			0
milk bottles were outside his house yesterday and plywood had been used to board up the door after the police broke in during their search			0
one neighbour said it was not unusual for mr @entity5 to visit his daughter			0
she added : ‘ he goes down to his daughter ’s every so often , so nobody thought anything about it			0
he ’s a lovely man			0
he ’s got one daughter and a grandson born in june			0
’ @entity53 nightmare : mr @entity5 is believed to have spent nearly two days on the @entity0 mr @entity5 ’s adventure echoes that of @entity100 ’s three - day ordeal last @entity101			1
the grandfather hit the headlines when he fell victim to the airport snow chaos after taking his wife to catch a holiday flight at @entity108			0
the disorientated 72 - year - old spent three days and nights driving up and down the @entity110 trying to find his way home to @entity113 , @entity114			1
mr @entity100 set off from @entity113 on december 23 to drive his wife to @entity115 where she was due to catch a flight to @entity117			0
however , the snow and ice meant the flight was diverted to @entity108			0
he was eventually found on christmas day , still at the wheel of his @entity121 , when he triggered a police camera and was flagged down by officers in @entity124			1
police cameras had recorded him driving around numerous towns in @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity124 .			0

82 - year - old gets disorientated on journey which should have taken just one hour
he is found safe and well in @entity63 , still at the wheel of his @entity136
