an emaciated boxer dog - its bones clearly visible beneath its fur - stares sadly into the camera after being rescued			1
he is one of two boxers , two - year - old brothers , which were rushed to a veterinary centre run by the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) for life - saving treatment			1
they feature in a new episode of @entity13 - show @entity12 , which investigates the ' epidemic ' of unwanted and discarded dogs in @entity16			1
the horrifying state of the animals reflects the plight of a growing ' epidemic ' of discarded dogs that are dealt by the @entity8 's officers			1
the programme , which airs tomorrow at 7.30pm also features a small terrier named @entity36 which had been dumped over the eight foot - tall security fence at @entity16 's @entity39 charity - despite the building being open to the public at the time			2
ms @entity25 said : ' we went to the @entity8 centre in @entity45 and we got a call to say two boxer dogs had been brought in			0
they were among the most severely neglected dogs the inspector had seen			2
' they were completely anaemic and severely malnourished			2
it would have taken quite a lot of time to get them so starved			0
sad : inspectors said the two dogs , which are two - year - old brothers , were amongst the most malnourished they had seen ' they had sores on their body which showed their skin was a closed to the bone as it could get			1
' @entity8 inspector , @entity63 said ' irresponsible ' dog ownership is a ' major animal welfare issue in @entity16 with far too many owners not embracing concepts such as neutering and microchipping			0
' we produce far too many puppies in @entity16 , ' he said , ' and this is reflected in the cases of canine cruelty and neglect that we encounter on a daily basis and the numbers of dogs discarded in our pounds			1
' @entity78 , executive director of the @entity39 said : ' unfortunately , we are seeing over 1,200 stray and abandoned dogs coming through our doors every year			0
' people are still taking on the responsibility of dog ownership without enough consideration of what it entails , ' he said , ' a dog is for life			0
' we hope that by working with organisations such as @entity13 and the @entity8 we can highlight this issue and inform the public to really think about what is involved in owning a dog for life			0
' the two boxers featured on the show have recovered from their ordeal and are due to be re-homed .			0
