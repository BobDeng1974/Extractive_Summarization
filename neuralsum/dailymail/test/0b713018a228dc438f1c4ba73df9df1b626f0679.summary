@entity1 commuters faced traffic chaos this morning while thousands are still without power as firefighters battle to extinguish an underground blaze that has been raging for more than 24 hours			1
more than 2,000 office workers had to be evacuated yesterday due to the fire in @entity9 which apparently started in a tunnel carrying electrical cables , causing flames to erupt from the pavement and filling the area with smoke			1
although the blaze has now been brought under control it has not been put out entirely , and firefighters still do not know the cause of the fire			1
commuters were urged to avoid travelling through @entity9 if possible , and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal			1
tonight 35 firefighters and police officers remain at @entity48 , where flames were seen erupting from a manhole cover yesterday			1
@entity51 is closed , as is the @entity52 , while @entity53 is closed northbound			1
@entity54 said that 15 bus routes were being diverted , and witnesses described seeing dozens of buses backed up along @entity9 , but underground services have returned to normal			1
more than 1,000 buildings remain without power today , with businesses , government departments and tourist attractions forced to close ahead of the @entity64 weekend			1
firefighters and gas workers continue to tackle the flames in the @entity68 carnage : parts of the road had to be dug up in an attempt to extinguish the fire below the ground the underground fire has stopped power workers from accessing their equipment @entity79 : firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area exhausted : firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours blocked : roads were closed in the wake of the fire , whose cause is still unknown @entity93 said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area , but it is not known when buildings will regain power			1
a spokesman said : ' a major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we can not yet access our equipment			1
' our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible			2
' we had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today			0
' we are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated			0
the cause of the incident is being investigated			0
' fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer , and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses			2
@entity125 of @entity124 said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control			2
' this has been a technically difficult incident to tackle , ' he said			0
' the reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night , the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished			2
' however , the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close			2
' works : more than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central @entity1 disruption : the road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area @entity125 of @entity124 said the blaze was ' a technically difficult incident to tackle ' deserted : the @entity9 area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption closure : shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience one council boss warned that there was a ' worrying trend ' of pavements exploding in central @entity1 and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents			1
' we do not fully yet know what caused the fire in @entity9 on wednesday , ' said @entity177 of @entity178			1
' however , pavements have exploded in central @entity1 previously and it is a very worrying trend			0
' our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital 's infrastructure , as it benefits the whole @entity184			0
' we are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties , but the losses to big businesses in the @entity189 , due to poor infrastructure , is just not acceptable			2
we want to see action			0
' in july , @entity192 was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire			1
meanwhile , in february last year , 50 people were evacuated from a street in north @entity1 after a pavement burst into flames			0
and in april 2013 , a fireball burst from a pavement in @entity204 , central @entity1 , narrowly missing a passer - by standing yards away			0
