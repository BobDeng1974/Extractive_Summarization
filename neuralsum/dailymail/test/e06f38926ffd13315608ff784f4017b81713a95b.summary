they were taken at the age of 18 , when he was , in his own words , just ‘ a @entity24 kid from @entity25 , ’ and before he had transformed himself , in every sense , into the figure lampooned on @entity29 show ‘ @entity30 , ’ with such devastating consequences			1

hurtful parody : according to those closest to @entity16 , the doctor – who had been suffering from depression – had been left ‘ devastated ’ by recent rumors comparing him to the grotesque character of dr @entity43 in @entity45 ’s @entity29 show @entity45 takes a selfie with @entity210 and @entity211 last february			1
poignantly , given his own unhappy demise , dr @entity16 ’s ambition in his work had always been , he said , ‘ to restore a face to harmony , ’ and ‘ to keep people working and feeling vital and good about themselves			2

he is actually called @entity251 , rendering the veil of fiction between the character and @entity16 even more gossamer thin			2
at one point the character is seen drinking from a surgical bag and reinflating his face after being punched			0
for dr @entity16 , who had always prided himself on being ‘ a kind of pioneer in pushing the limits to see how things work and what the look would be , ’ the humor , viewed through the prism of his depression , cut deep			2
there have been many tributes since his death comedian and former @entity274 star , @entity269 , yesterday tweeted , ‘ dr @entity16 was one of the sweetest , nicest , most generous people i have had the good fortune to meet & work with			2
