@entity0 is ready to put himself in the firing line as the @entity3 attempt to derail @entity5 's charge for the @entity7 finals			1
the 23 - year - old @entity9 winger could yet be asked to fill in at left - back having slotted into that position to spectacular effect in november 's 4 - 1 friendly victory over the @entity14 , in which he scored twice			1
@entity0 could be required with @entity16 still battling to shake off the after - effects of a broken ankle , but he insists he will be happy to be cast in the role of emergency defender if manager @entity21 calls upon him			1
@entity0 acknowledges the crowd after @entity3 lost against @entity23 at @entity24 last year @entity0 scores from a free kick for @entity3 against @entity14 at the @entity26 last november he said : ' over the last couple of years , i have been a bit more accustomed to the role			1
i have played there quite a bit , so if he calls upon me on sunday and needs me to play left - back , i 'll play left - back and i 'll give 110 per cent , and hopefully we can come away with the result we need			1
' it 's definitely a change , but it 's just concentration more than anything else			2
it 's just work on the mind more than the body			2
you know how quick and how strong you are , it 's just getting your positioning right			0
' the more i play there , the more comfortable i feel			0
i have played there quite a bit and i will be ready to play there if that 's where he needs me to play			0
' indeed , @entity0 views the prospect of having to adapt his game to another position as one which can only benefit his career in the longer term			2
@entity0 ( front left ) holds off a challenge from @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity60 ( right ) last october he said : ' you need to learn new things if you are going to push on in the game , and hopefully that 's just another string to my bow			1
hopefully i can show that in the upcoming games and many years to come			0
' @entity0 has played only minutes of football in more than a month after damaging a calf muscle in training with his club , although he admits the prospect of pulling on the green shirt against the @entity74 was a major motivation in his quicker - than - expected recovery			1
he said : ' when it happened , one of the first things that popped into my head was this game			0
i was looking forward to getting ready for it and that just put a bit of a bump in the road			0
@entity9 's @entity0 ( right ) is tackled by @entity88 's @entity87 during a @entity90 match last month ' but i feel great , i have done everything i needed to do and i have got back for a game that i really wanted to be playing in			1
' it felt quite bad at the time , so i knew i 'd done something that was going to put me out of playing			0
i 'd just had a good run of games up to it , so it was just disappointing			0
' when i went in , i had to wait for two days for the blood to settle down and then go and get my scan , and i think they said four to six weeks and i got back in just under three , so that was good			2
