@entity1 striker @entity0 admits he has never experienced anything like the current circus surrounding the @entity5 side			1
six players - @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 - withdrew from the squad on the eve of saturday 's trip to @entity16 citing injuries , and this is just the latest incident in another turbulent period at @entity20			1
a ' freakish set of events ' was how beleaguered boss @entity23 described the sextet 's absence after the game but @entity0 , who scored @entity1 ' goal in the 2 - 1 defeat at @entity29 , told @entity30 : ' we 're around it every day			1
@entity1 striker @entity0 ( centre ) admits he is surprised by the chaos at @entity20 at the moment @entity8 and three other @entity36 were among those who withdrew form the @entity1 squad @entity11 was another player that withdrew as part of the latest drama at @entity20 ' people draw their own conclusions over what happened ( with the withdrawals )			1
it 's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value , but it 's been like it all season in one way or another			1
' when asked if there was a split in the camp , the 31 - year - old added : ' it 's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened			0
' i 've never known anything like it in football and i 've played for teams scrapping for their lives - @entity67 last year - and teams that have been promoted			0
i 've played in the @entity69 with a bunch of @entity5 players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit			2
' sometimes you can get away with being very , very average - i would class myself as an average footballer - but i 've had a team around me and it works			0
' former @entity1 captain @entity78 , meanwhile , branded the players who withdrew at short notice from saturday 's match a ' disgrace ' and called for them to be sacked by the club			1
@entity36 quartet @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity85 and @entity86 all told @entity23 they were injured and could not travel to @entity87			1
according to the manager , @entity10 had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover , while @entity7 and @entity12 declared themselves unfit after training on thursday with the rest pulling out following a ' light ' session on friday			2
but @entity78 was unimpressed and wants the players out of @entity20			2
' i would sack them and take the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) on , ' he said on @entity100 's @entity99			0
' i do n't think players can do that , it 's scandalous and it 's just another story for @entity1 that is disgraceful			1
' striker @entity7 used @entity105 to defend himself , as did goalkeeper @entity10 who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against @entity109 on tuesday night			0
however , @entity78 questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw			0
' in the old days you used to play with anything , cuts or one thing or another , ' he said			0
' the managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not			0
you did n't just come in and say ' i 've got a headache , i 'm going home '			0
i 'm sure with @entity122 or @entity123 , i ca n't imagine what would have happened if you 'd have done that			0
' the withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued @entity1			1
@entity7 was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by @entity16 @entity23 had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the @entity16 game @entity23 's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks , despite leading the club to championship safety after taking over from ill - fated predecessors @entity138 and @entity139			1
he saw assistant @entity140 lose his job without warning on april 2 and his own deal , which expires at the end of the season , looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club 's current regime			2
@entity148 president @entity147 has been banned since january after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in @entity36 , but is due to return in a fortnight 's time			0
@entity78 , who played for @entity1 between 1972 and 1982 , was left to lament the situation at his old club			1
' it 's a club that 's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years , ' the @entity156 defender said			2
' we just stutter from disaster to disaster , joke to joke			0
if it was n't sickening it would be funny			0
you could n't write a book about @entity1 and what 's happened			1
' personally , i do n't know the @entity36 guy but i do n't think he realises the size of the club , it 's just a little play thing and he 's making a mess of it in my opinion			2

@entity1 forward @entity178 is surprised by the drama at the club
six @entity1 players recently withdrew from the squad to face @entity16
manager @entity23 is facing increasing pressure in his role
