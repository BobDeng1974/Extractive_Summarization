it 's the age old debate : which day is best for booking flights to ensure you get the best deal ? and it may have just been settled			1
according to new research from @entity8 and the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , it 's best to buy tickets on a tuesday - and ideally , more than 21 days in advance - to take advantage of the best possible rates			1
to take advantage of the best prices , book your air travel on a tuesday and at least three weeks in advance travellers who are able to fly on a thursday and return on a monday will enjoy the greatest savings on a long weekend away			2
alternatively , those booking a saturday to tuesday short - haul weekend flight can save up to 25 per cent , particularly when compared to the more expensive sunday return			0
@entity8 recommends booking your flights at least seven weeks in advance			1
for domestic routes , the lowest fares are usually found 50 to 100 days before departure , with the absolute lowest fares found around 57 days prior			1
cheers to that ! according to @entity8 's research , it will be cheaper to fly premium in 2015 the report is predicting a general price drop across @entity36 and @entity37 when it comes to international flights , the lowest fares were found even farther in advance - between 150 and 225 days - with the lowest price around the 171 day mark			1
and package deals are another way to save cash			0
by booking the flight and hotel at the same time , you can save up to us $ 540 ( £ 344 ) across all destinations			0
in big resort destinations , like @entity52 or @entity53 , you can actually save a whopping us $ 1,100 ( £ 700 ) simply by bundling			0
for the best deal on a short - haul domestic flight , the lowest rates can be found about 57 days in advance the findings are contained in a report , preparing for takeoff : @entity61 for 2015 , which highlights all of the changes that passengers can expect in upcoming months			2
and there 's good news for travellers			0
@entity8 and the @entity9 predict that many ticket prices will decrease overall			1
this can be attributed to an increase in scheduled flights and a drop in fuel prices , which will mean a general price drop across @entity36 and @entity37			0
for international flights , booking anywhere between 150 - 225 days ahead will offer the best deal tuesday remains the best day to book a flight , with the lowest prices across the board in @entity36 , another major factor will be the rise of low - cost carriers , which ' unbundle ' amenities and force the big - name carriers to do the same to compete			1
not only that , but it 's going to be cheaper to fly in the premium cabins			0
the research indicates that the gap in fares between flying premium and coach will continue to narrow - and ultimately , could even get to a point where premium - class tickets are n't that much more expensive than tickets in coach			0
this may not hold true for all flights , but it wo n't hurt to check the price of first - and business - class seats before you book an economy ticket .			2

@entity8 and the @entity9 expect ticket prices to fall
tuesday remains ideal day to book flights , 50 to 100 days in advance
for international flights , booking 171 days in advance offers best rate
