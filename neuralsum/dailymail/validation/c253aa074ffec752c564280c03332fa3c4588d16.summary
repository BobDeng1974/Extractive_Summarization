it has baffled scientists for years - why the penguin waddles in such a distinctive manner			1
most other diving birds are able to simply fly on land - but not the penguin			1
now , researchers hope to unravel the mystery of the waddle - and find out how it evolved watch the penguins on their custom catwalk using a special motion detecting ' catwalk ' professor @entity14 and paleobiologist @entity16 have been measuring how the penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle			1
researchers set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it			1
the penguins walked over this to get their breakfast researchers also filmed the walk in slow motion , and are looking for the forces the birds excert , how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are			1
scientists from the @entity37 and @entity38 have visited @entity39 to study the way the animals walk			1
prof @entity14 from the @entity37 said : ' the upright posture and waddling gait of penguins is not often seen in other birds			2
' most wing - propelled diving birds move using flight when they are not in the water			2
' using a special motion detecting ' catwalk ' professor @entity14 and paleobiologist @entity16 have been measuring how the @entity52 penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle			2
' we 're trying to understand the minute detail of how waddling works with living penguins , and then taking that back in time , looking at the fossil record of penguins to understand how evolving for such a specialised underwater lifestyle has affected their ability to move on land , ' said @entity65			0
' we set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it			0
if they want to move quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain they may jump with both feet together			0
' the penguins walked over this to get their breakfast ' we were looking for the forces they exert , how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are			0
' ' zoos provide an opportunity for research scientists to look at organisms that otherwise would be very difficult to study in the wild			0
' @entity88 keeper @entity87 said : ' we know our penguins really well , we know what they eat , we know how they behave on a day to day basis , and we know how to breed them for conservation purposes			0
' but to know how they evolved to be like this is very important			2

researchers at @entity39 built *sensor* - laden area to *monitor* movement
hope it will give new *insight* into how the penguin evolved unique walk
