by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:47 est , 31 december 2013 updated : 04:31 est , 1 january 2014 it seems that whether you ’re an @entity4 fan or a @entity6 devotee is determined not by who you are – but by where you live			1
our viewing habits reveal strong regional allegiances , with those in the @entity13 tuning in to anything hosted by @entity16 stars @entity17 and those in the @entity19 preferring @entity22 export @entity20			1
research commissioned exclusively by the @entity24 has revealed our favourite television programmes of the past year , broken down for the first time into different regions of the country			2
while @entity31 reality show i ’m a celebrity … @entity32 ! was the @entity34 ’s most popular show of 2013 – drawing in an average of 12.4million viewers – it was not universally favoured			1
viewers in the north of the country and in @entity40 were gripped by the i ’m a celebrity showdown between contestants @entity42 and olympian @entity44			1
the @entity45 and @entity46 were the biggest fans of @entity47 , won by @entity49 ( pictured ) but in the @entity45 it failed to register among the top five shows of the year			2
instead , viewers in the @entity53 preferred period dramas such as @entity6 and @entity55			2
in @entity57 , the top - rated show of the year was the men ’s wimbledon tennis final , where @entity60 ended the nation ’s 77 - year wait for a trophy by defeating @entity64			1
but while the @entity67 ’s match transfixed 2.4million @entity68 – as well as another 1.3million viewers north of the @entity70 – it failed to make the top five anywhere else in the @entity34			2
instead , those in many regions preferred to watch home - grown dramas and presenters			0
in the @entity13 , any programme featuring presenting duo @entity77 and @entity78 was a hit			1
the region ’s top show of the year was @entity34 ’s @entity82 , with i ’m a celebrity and @entity84 close behind – all fronted by the pair			1
across the @entity87 , however , viewers preferred @entity20			0
the @entity31 soap is based in @entity89 , a fictional town located in @entity22			0
and the capital ’s favourite soap , perhaps unsurprisingly , was @entity93 ’s eastenders , set in @entity57 ’s @entity94			1
some of the regional differences are harder to explain , though			0
@entity31 ’s hit drama @entity6 has its most loyal fanbase in the @entity98 , where it beat @entity47 and @entity100 to the top spot			0
but in the @entity45 , the most popular drama was @entity93 ’s @entity55 , based in 1950s east @entity57			1
the figures were compiled for the @entity24 by official ratings analysts @entity104			0
using a sample of 5,000 homes , the researchers were also able to put together the favourite shows of 2013 among @entity24 readers			1
@entity111 of the list was @entity6 , with an average of 1.6million @entity24 readers per episode			0
it narrowly beat @entity55 , which typically had 1.4million readers tuning in , with @entity47 in third place			0
@entity34 's @entity82 proved most popular in the @entity13 , as did any programme hosted by @entity16 duo @entity17 a recent survey found one in four of us would rather watch television than take part in traditional hobbies such as visiting museums or playing sport			1
a quarter of people now list their favourite pastime as watching television , compared with just 5 per cent who say they enjoy playing a team sport			0
only 4 per cent said they spent their free time playing a musical instrument , while fishing was enjoyed by just 2 per cent			0
stamp and coin collecting , which had its heyday in the 1950s , is now only favoured by 2 per cent , while model making has a following of a mere 1 per cent			0
campaigners said the demise of these traditional hobbies was symptomatic of a society preoccupied with celebrity and reality tv			2
the survey , by @entity152 , also showed only 8 per cent spent time visiting museums while 9 per cent said they enjoyed the arts .			0

overall i *'m* a celebrity was the most viewed show in 2013
however it was only popular in the @entity19 and @entity40
in @entity57 @entity60 's @entity164 final was the *highest* rated
in the @entity13 anything hosted by @entity17 did well
