a decade ago , executives at @entity1 were informed that their bid to open a flagship store at @entity5 ’s famous @entity4 had been denied			2
at that point , the discount clothing chain was n’t deemed ' posh ' enough for such a prestigious location			2
five years later , though , @entity1 secured a prime position on @entity10 — and now the firm ’s executives must be patting themselves on their backs			2
for they have really hit marketing gold thanks to pictures of prince @entity16 leaving the store with his own bag of cut - price bargains , which included a hoodie , a t - shirt and a mobile phone cover			1
bargain hunter : prince @entity16 leaves the @entity25 branch of @entity1 with his discount haul and he ’s not the only one to give the cheap - as - chips chain the royal seal of approval — @entity30 has also been spotted in the @entity25 branch , as has @entity16 ’s ex @entity32			1
former model @entity33 and actress @entity34 have scouted for bargains there , too			1
on the surface , a @entity1 store looks a bit like a disorganised jumble sale , but for those in the know , it can be a style mecca			2
for the shopper with time , patience and a discerning eye , thousands of designer brands can be found crammed inside			1
savvy customers can snap up this season ’s styles at up to 60 per cent off the normal retail price , if they know what they are looking for and when to look for it			1
the stock is diverse , ranging from old pieces from two to three seasons ago ( a lifetime in the fashion world ) to up - to - the minute excess stock from designer boutiques , from labels such as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity67 favourites like @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 can also be picked up at knock - down prices			2
@entity1 also brokers deals to buy up excess factory stock — which , while including things that simply did n’t sell well in @entity10 or designer stores , also includes gorgeous must - have items in one - off sizes			1
new deliveries arrive at stores around the country every day , with one fifth of the total stock replaced each week			2
fan : @entity84 of @entity85 is known to shop at @entity1 discount : despite her rich family , @entity32 loves a bargain fan : polo player and former model @entity33 loves @entity1 there are no stock rooms — so what you see is what they ’ve got			1
the daily delivery goes straight out on the shop floor			2
this is why the smartest shoppers queue patiently outside each morning			2
and the randomness of what ’s delivered is half of the fun of shopping in these chaotic , brightly - lit warehouses			0
' the store managers never know what is coming in until they throw open the doors of the lorry , ' reveals the brand ’s press officer @entity110			0
' we lay our stores out very differently from other brands , organising everything by department , category and size — so a lady looking for a size 14 sundress should go to head for the dress rails and look through the selection of size 14s			0
' what she does n’t mention is the fact that in the scrum to find a designer bargain , lots of stock ends up scattered all over the place			1
you have to be tenacious to be a @entity1 shopper			0
the stores tend to be located in the less salubrious corners of town centres or on retail parks and have relatively spartan interiors , while separate departments all merge into one chaotic whole , and customer service can leave a lot to be desired			1
@entity1 languished near the bottom of a recent which survey on the best and worst customer service at the @entity147 ’s major retail stores			1
but it ’s the no - frills experience that helps keep its prices incredibly low			0
so how can you make the most of @entity1 ? turning up for a random rummage really is n’t going to cut it in @entity153			0
first , you have to choose your location wisely			0
the stock is tailored to the demographic of the local area — only 24 of the 260 @entity147 stores stock the much - coveted @entity160 line , for example			0
this includes high - priced designer brands such as @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			1
visit the store ’s website ( tkmaxx.com ) to find out if a store near you stocks it			0
second , be smart about what you buy			0
stylist magazine ’s fashion director @entity174 , who is a huge fan , snaps up designer denim like @entity177 , 7 for all @entity179 and @entity178 for £ 50 a pair — they cost around £ 150 in high - end department stores			1
@entity183 dress , £ 349.99 , ( saving £ 1,150 ) , pink and black @entity186 patent heels , £ 149.99 , ( saving £ 216 ) @entity188 and nude @entity65 jumpsuit , £ 399.99 , ( saving £ 1,525 ) , @entity186 nude patent heels , as before @entity190 , £ 349.99 , ( saving £ 449 ) , @entity192 jeans , £ 39.99 , ( saving £ 60 ) , red @entity186 shoes , £ 159.99 , ( saving £ 278 ) gold @entity195 gown , £ 169.99 , ( saving £ 730 ) , black patent @entity186 heels , £ 159.99 , ( saving £ 253 ) sunglasses are also a smart buy as they generally have a large array of different brands — from police to @entity203 — at a fraction of their original price			1
childrenswear — and the toys section — can be a gold mine			0
navigate your way past the gaudy fluorescent tutus and logo - heavy kidswear and you can pick up @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity218 pieces , as well as wooden toys from cult brand @entity220 , for around £ 10			0
the store also stocks niche hard - to - find @entity225 brands such as @entity226 and @entity227 — and as stock often arrives on its original hangers you can spot these treasures a mile off if you know what you are looking for			1
as a @entity1 devotee , i would advise shoppers to avoid the accessories , shoes and leather goods departments , which all seem to be at the cheaper end of the spectrum and offer few designer steals			1
but do make a beeline for the beauty department , where luxury shampoos and conditioners are a quarter of the price you ’ll pay in any @entity10 shop			1
the menswear departments have decent offerings , including good sportswear staples from @entity252 and @entity253 , and stacks of underwear from @entity166 , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258			0
but for many shoppers — myself included — it ’s the home department that delivers the bargains you ’ll love			0
here , it ’s easy to find fabulous named brands and classic design that will give friends the impression you ’ve lavished thousands on your home			0
these pieces do n’t date like clothes do , which makes it astonishing to find them so generously discounted			0
this week , in an impromptu visit to my local store in @entity276 , i found crystal wine glasses from @entity278 , stacks of @entity281 roasting dishes and @entity283 china — all at half their normal price			1
the store is great for designer bedlinen too			2
not all stores have brilliant homes departments but @entity1 has 26 separate @entity290 stores across the @entity147 , where home - loving bargain hunters can kit out their homes like an interiors magazine			0
but it ’s still the womenswear which creates the biggest buzz at @entity1			0
@entity297 , fashion director at @entity298 , says she was rewarded for her diligent shopping at @entity1 recently with coats from @entity301 and @entity302 , both discounted by up to £ 1,000			0
' you need to shop there regularly to discover the gems as stock changes so quickly , ' she says , adding that the store ’s online shop ( which also updates with new stock every day ) is one way of snapping up a bargain without the slog of shopping in - store — and is also handy if there ’s not a @entity309 near you			0
one thing all @entity1 fans agree on is that you must buy something when you see it : nothing hangs around for long			2
like sifting for gold , you need time and patience to rummage through the rails , but there are amazing bargains to be found — just ask prince @entity16			1
all clothes were picked up at the @entity25 branch of @entity1			1
