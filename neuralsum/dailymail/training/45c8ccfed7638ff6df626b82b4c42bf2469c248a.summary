by @entity0 published : 15:13 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 16:51 est , 29 august 2012 most typical five - month - old babies ca n't crawl , let alone drive , but an experimental buggy has given some lucky children the chance to steer their own robot			0
designed by researchers at @entity9 in @entity10 to assist babies with disabilities , the @entity7 encourages children to move around independently using the pint sized scooter			1
built from a motorised base , a booster seat and a @entity18 , the @entity7 was developed to stimulate the cognitive functions of children suffering from conditions such as cerebral palsy or @entity23			1
scroll down for @entity24 the baby at @entity9 in @entity10 takes the @entity7 through its paces intended for children who are unable to crawl because they suffer from a mental impairment , the @entity7 is supposed to grant independent mobility to infants and kick start their development			1
' in typically developing infants , the initiation of independent locomotion heralds concomitant development in aspects of communicative , emotional , perceptual , cognitive and social behaviour , ' states a study produced by the research team at @entity9			1
' typically developing children whose mobility has been restricted for even relatively short periods of time have been found to demonstrate apathetic behaviour and depressed motivation , ' states the study			2
at the moment though , the robots encourage children with disabilities to move around independently , at exactly the same time that other five - month - old infants have learned to crawl			2
however , one of the scientists in the research team which created the @entity7 has said that the device is in fact only a developmental aid for children and parents should always encourage their child to walk			1
' for children who are typically developing we would encourage parents to support their child 's ' natural ' development , because at each stage of motor development , children develop strength and skills that help them master the next developmental steps , ' said @entity71 associate professor , @entity72 at @entity9 ' that said , we do n't think that robot experience in and of itself would stunt development ( unless children were n't provided sufficient experiences for typical movement development )			2
' my colleagues ( @entity81 and @entity82 ) and i think that it might actually increase the motivation of children to move			0
one child leans to the left to grabs a paper bag they find interesting while another child is offered a firurative ' carrot ' to move towards the researcher it is movement which some childhood specialists believes encourages mental development , as children seek out new environments for their brain to make sense of			1
' we think that babies with disabilities are missing an opportunity for learning that typically developing babies have , ' said @entity71 to @entity105			0
previously , researchers had focused on providing babies with joysticks , however , the @entity7 relies on the baby simply leaning in the direction that it wants to travel			2
' what i think is exciting is that we 're pushing the age envelope much and much younger , ' said @entity114 , a professor of physical therapy at the @entity116 who was not part of the @entity7 research			2
the research team at @entity9 were driven on by findings of past research which indicate that developing children undergo dramatic mental changes when they start to move by themselves			1
however , some children with disabilities do not begin to learn to explore their environment until they are three - years - old			0
the @entity7 built by @entity9 to enable disabled children to experience movement and learning and therefore increase their development ' we know the brain is aching for exploration , ' said @entity134 , a physical therapist at the @entity136 who is an expert in robot maneuverability devices for infants			1
' it we treated a typically developing kid the way we treat these kids , it would be as it we put these kids in a closet of cage until they can take adult commands , ' said @entity150			0
to create the @entity7 , @entity151 teamed up with physical therapist @entity152 and computer programmer @entity81			0
the @entity154 board part registers shifts in weight to the left or right or forwards or backwards depending on how the child leans			0
a child is encouraged to lean forward thereby making the @entity7 move forward as trials for the @entity161 equipped device continued the @entity9 team added sonar - style instruments to the front and back of the @entity7 to halt the children running into obstacles			1
the team discovered after a little training , 90 percent of able bodied infants could successfully control the device			0
and then children with disabilities were given trial runs to see they would react			0
one , a seven - month - old boy with @entity23 only used the @entity7 satisfactorily nine - percent of the time , while a 15 - month old with cerebral palsy became 85 - percent proficient in use of the device			0
the @entity178 was the first self - balancing electric powered transportation machine and was introduced in 2002 researchers believe that the @entity7 needs more trialing before they can think about a cost - effective manufacture , especially in its safety features			0
however , the researchers believe that the @entity7 genuinely aids in the development of mentally disabled children and will push to see them put into production			1
' some parents of typically - developing infants that we have worked with have mentioned that their children seem to be a bit frustrated when they are n't in the @entity7 , because they ca n't move , ' said @entity71			1
' so the realization that there is a great world out there to explore might increase children 's desire to get moving ! '			0

developed for children who suffer a mental disability the @entity7 is supposed to grant independent mobility to infants and kick start their development
