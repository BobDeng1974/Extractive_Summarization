by @entity1 @entity0 and @entity2 for @entity3 updated : 17:09 est , 29 january 2015 @entity5 may have starred in hundreds of high - profile fashion shows over the course of her five - year modeling career , but she 's still rather prone to falling over			1
the 20 - year - old beauty posted a snap to her @entity13 account this morning of her bandaged ankle ; the result of ' walking off the end of the runway ' at the @entity18 show yesterday at @entity19			1
the fall was n't captured on camera , so it may have happened during a rehearsal , but miss @entity5 blamed the vision - obscuring ' bee - keepers ' headgear she was wearing for causing her to lose her footing			1
pictured , miss @entity5 ( upright ) at the show which caused her injury if the fall did happen during a rehearsal , it means that @entity38 would have walked the show regardless of her injury , only seeking medical attention afterwards			1
she accompanied the photo with an explanation , stating : ' the result after walking off the end of # jeanpaulgaultier runway from my bee - keepers mask yesterday			2
' fans from her 135,000 - strong @entity13 following have expressed their sympathies , with one commenting , ' speedy healing ! ' and another writing , ' get well soon gorgeous '			0
luckily for the model - hailing from @entity55 , @entity56 and famed for her rosebud - pout and gap - tooth - combo - @entity60 does n't start for another two weeks			0
miss @entity5 has already walked several shows in @entity62 this week ; including @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
buzz - worthy : miss @entity5 blamed the vision - obscuring ' bee - keepers ' headgear she was wearing ( left ) for causing her to lose her footing			2
pictured ( right ) - the model backstage at yesterday 's @entity66 show still smiling : miss @entity5 , pictured at @entity18 's show yesterday , sans - dangerous headgear and flashing a warm grin in demand : she has already walked several shows in @entity62 this week , including @entity63 ( left ) , @entity65 ( center ) and @entity66 ( right ) success ! miss @entity5 did manage to avoid falling at last sunday 's @entity79 ( pictured ) , having slipped over twice on the designer 's catwalk in the past , once in 2014 and once in 2012 this is not the first time the teenager , from @entity55 , @entity56 , has fallen at a high - profile show			1
in fact , it 's her fourth documented tumble			2
her bambi - legs last collapsed at @entity64 's 2014 @entity89 , and before that , at the same designers ' 2012 @entity90			2
and back in 2011 , miss @entity5 made headlines around the world when she fell numerous times on one catwalk at @entity97 's @entity98 in @entity99			1
the performance this time was so dramatic that many believed she had fallen on purpose for effect , but miss @entity5 insists this was not the case			2
repeat offender : miss @entity5 's bambi - legs last collapsed at @entity64 's @entity109 ( pictured ) over she goes : before that , she fell at @entity64 's 2012 @entity90 ( pictured ) while wearing some admittedly tricky - looking heels sense of humor : still , the industry favorite raised her arms in victory once she was back on her feet few girls could survive such a faux - pas , as a model agency insider once revealed to the @entity121			1
indeed , our source admitted that falling on the catwalk can in fact be career - threatening			0
' it 's quite common for girls to be quietly dropped by their agents after tripping or falling during a show , ' they said			0
' as far as the designers are concerned the model 's job is to make the clothes look fantastic			0
that 's compromised when she starts stumbling down the catwalk like a drunk			0
they added that many models lived in fear of falling on the runway , and often had tricks to avoid it happening			0
not again ! back in 2011 , miss @entity5 made headlines around the world when she fell numerous times on one catwalk at @entity97 's @entity98 in @entity99 ( pictured ) dramatic : the performance was so extreme that many believed she had fallen on purpose for effect ' i know girls who will do anything to avoid it , include asking for shoes a bone - crushing size too small to ensure there is no chance of their high heels coming loose half way down the catwalk , ' they revealed			1
' i came across one girl who carried sandpaper in her @entity169 handbag and used it to rough up the bottom of her show shoes to give her extra grip			0
' the source did admit , however , that the more well - known models were less likely to be affected			0
' if the model has an existing profile and clientele then she will probably survive a few stumbles - look at @entity97			2
' luckily for @entity38 , who was bullied at school for her unusual looks , her clients appear to be highly forgiving			0
since making her debut , she has appeared in campaigns for @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 , among many others			0
fall collection : a history of runway stumbles taking a tumble : a model went flying on the slippery runway at a @entity194 show in february 2010 slip - up : a @entity196 show in 2008 descended into farce when a last - minute decision to have the models wear little socks with their heels caused many of them to slip and fall across the runway @entity97 moment : schoolgirl model @entity206 , then 16 , made an impact in more ways than one when she tripped and fell as she closed the @entity210 catwalk show in 2010 helping hand : @entity212 is lifted to her feet by another model after falling during the @entity216 swimwear show at @entity217 fashion week in 2011 crash landing : a model took a dramatic tumble in @entity222 in february at the @entity224 show in 2010 the original : @entity97 's fall on the @entity228 catwalk in @entity62 in 1993 went down in history			1
