by @entity1 reporter published : 18:50 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 18:52 est , 20 october 2013 ' tip of the tongue ' lapses are more common in older people , but are not linked to dementia , a new study has revealed if those ‘ tip of the tongue ’ moments are becoming more frequent , fear not			2
they may be frustrating , but they do not indicate an increased risk of dementia , research has found			0
anecdotal evidence has long suggested that this type of memory lapse happens more often as we age – but its relationship to cognitive decline such as @entity23 ’s had never been established			1
so @entity25 researchers asked more than 700 participants , aged 18 to 99 , to give the names of famous places , common nouns or famous people , based on brief descriptions or pictures			1
the volunteers indicated which answers they knew , which they did not and which gave them a tip - of - the - tongue experience			0
several descriptions were particularly likely to induce such a moment like ' what is the name of the building where one can view images of celestial bodies on the inner surface of a dome ? ' and ' what is the name of the large waterfall in @entity50 that is one of the @entity52 ? ' of the pictures of the politicians and celebrities , @entity53 and @entity54 were most likely to induce a tip of the tongue moment			0
overall , older participants experienced more of these frustrating moments			0
but there was no association between the frequency of tip of the tongue occurrences and their performance on the types of memory tests often used in the detection of dementia			1
actor @entity54 , left , and former senator @entity53 , right , were most likely to induce a ' tip of the tongue ' moment , researchers at the @entity74 found psychologist dr @entity76 , of the @entity74 , said : ' we wondered whether these self reports are valid and , if they are , do they truly indicate age related failures of the type of memory used in the diagnosis of dementia ' ‘ even though increased age is associated with lower levels of episodic memory and with more frequent tip of the tongue experiences , the two phenomena seem to be largely independent of one another			2

anecdotal evidence has long suggested that ' tip of the tongue ' lapses occur more frequently with age
relationship to cognitive decline like @entity23 *'s* never been established
*scientists* at @entity74 studied 700 participants aged 18 to 99
found no link between frequency of tip of the tongue occurrences and performance on memory tests often used in dementia detection
