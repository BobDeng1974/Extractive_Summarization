@entity0 today refused to answer a maths question - in case he got it wrong			1
the prime minister backed plans for every child to be tested on their times table when they leave primary school			1
but he ducked a question on what is nine times eight , hours after education secretary @entity8 also insisted : ' i 'm not going to answer any maths questions			1
' prime minister @entity0 took part in a science lesson , during a visit to @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , but he ducked out of answering maths questions the @entity21 have declared ' war on illiteracy and innumeracy ' as part of a new @entity27 drive to improve standards			1
headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the @entity21 conservatives are returned to power			0
as well as demonstrating mathematical skills , pupils will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use ' accurate punctuation , spelling and grammar '			2
by the time they leave primary school all 11 year - olds will be able to read a novel , write a short story and recite their times tables up to 12			1
but mr @entity0 ducked a maths challenge when answering questions following a speech in north @entity18			1
asked by @entity49 political editor @entity48 to calculate nine times eight , mr @entity0 responded : ' i 'm going to plead the @entity8 defence , which is i do times tables only in the car with my children on the way to school			1
' i 'm going to stick to that just in case i get one wrong on your excellent television programme			0
' education secretary @entity8 insisted every 11 - year - old should know their times tables , but ducked a maths question on tv earlier mrs @entity65 insisted it was needed to prepare pupils for later life but turned bashful when put on the spot @entity70			1
laughing as she realised her times tables were about to be put to the test , she said : ' if it 's going to be a times table question then the answer is going to be the same as i have given all the other interviewers this morning , which is i think that actually children at home are going to want to say ' i know better than the education secretary '			1
' i 'm not going to answer any maths questions			2
i 've made that very clear			0
' she also dodged the question when appearing on @entity87 's @entity86 : ' no i 'm not going to be answering any because at the end of the day i know what it 's like with all these interviews , i will be doing lots of interviews this morning and there 'll be one where i get it [ the answer ] wrong and that 's the one that everyone is going to be focussing on			1
' we are going to have a number of years to make sure we get our young people ready and able to answer those questions			2
' questioned by presenter @entity103 , mrs @entity65 said : ' i 'm not going to answer any maths questions			2
i 've made that very clear ' in 1998 @entity107 's schools standards minister @entity106 was asked : what is seven times eight			1
he declared it ( wrongly ) to be 54 - having just called for pupils to learn their times tables back in 1998			1
last year chancellor @entity113 ducked exactly the same question when pressed on television by an inquisitive seven - year - old , saying that he had made it a rule in life ' not to answer a whole load of maths questions '			2
in 2013 sports minister @entity122 could not get a single right answer when she faced a series of on - air questions about football , rugby , tennis and the @entity129			2
asked who the @entity131 holders were			0
a slightly anxious - looking mrs @entity122 said : ' come on , help , ' before replying : ' @entity133 because it 's my favourite club			0
' the correct answer was @entity135			0
and @entity0 could not come up with the answer to one of the most basic question of all - what is the price of a loaf of bread - having to fall back on the excuse that he made his own using an electronic bread - maker			1
but she insisted that it was right to carry out tests on pupils before they leave primary school			1
she told @entity70 : ' we want every child to have the best start in life , and obviously that means getting it right from primary right the way through to secondary			0
' this is not about saying heads will automatically be replaced			0
this is about saying where a school does n't have the capacity to improve itself - and many do - or where they do n't have a plan to lead that school to being rated good or outstanding , which i think is what we want for all of our children , then yes ... one of the answers is to get new leadership in			2
' but there are some fantastic headteachers up and down this country who would be going and offering support to those schools and their heads			0
' she said the policy would foster ' collaboration ' between schools to produce the best results			0
' education can be life - transforming , and that means we have to give every child the best possible start in life to fulfil their potential			0
' mrs @entity65 said that ' just enough is not good enough ' for pupils , and insisted the policy would help @entity200 schools ' compete with the best in the world '			0
since replacing @entity203 as @entity204 last summer , mrs @entity65 has studiously avoided putting her academic abilities to the test on camera			0
last year she was asked by a 10 - year - old pupil a 10 - year - old pupil what the cube root of 125 is			0
but she laughed it of saying : ' i think it is probably better that politicians do n't do maths or spelling on air			0
