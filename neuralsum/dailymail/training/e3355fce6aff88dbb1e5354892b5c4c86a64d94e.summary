after weeks of fresh sea air , endless sunshine , and having every whim catered for , it ’s little wonder many cruise passengers return home with a sinking feeling			0
but it appears they ’re weighed down by more than simply post-holiday blues			0
most cruise passengers gain a pound a day in weight during a two - week holiday at sea , according to a poll – coming back a stone heavier than when they left			1
all - you - can - eat : passengers blame the high - class but often calorific dining facilities on board the ship for the extraordinary weight gain their broader waistlines are hardly a surprise – given the relaxing onboard lifestyle plus mountains of food available round the clock			1
many respondents reckoned they put on more weight cruising than they do at @entity33 , having enjoyed the high - class , but often high - calorie and ‘ all you can eat ’ dining facilities offered on most modern vessels			1
the findings of the study , by independent cruise travel agents @entity41 , are unlikely to encourage anyone watching their weight to sign up for a seaborne adventure			1
tempting : @entity47 dining often sees passengers indulge in bigger meals than they 're used to they surveyed 1,281 @entity50 who had been on a cruise and found 52 per cent said they put on up to a stone during a two - week holiday			1
one in 11 ( 9 per cent ) put on around 4lbs while a further 6 per cent were even worse and put on up to 18lbs			1
@entity55 : ' i 'll break it gently			0
some people might think you 've been on a cruise ' more than eight in ten ( 84 per cent ) admitted they ate a lot more than normal as they sailed the oceans and 31 per cent admitted they ate double their normal calories			2
and more than four in ten ( 41 per cent ) struggle to shift the extra weight once they got home			0
@entity67 , cruise development manager of @entity41 said : ‘ i am as guilty as these respondents when it comes to indulging when on a cruise holiday , as the delicious food and drink on offer can be difficult to say no to			1
‘ this is particularly the case when on an all - inclusive cruise , where you know that all of the tempting food on offer has already been paid for			1
’ most cruises contain a wide variety of eateries , from fine - dining restaurants to fish and chip - style takeaways			0
many provide ‘ midnight feasts ’ , while restaurants often stay open until the early hours to indulge guests			0
control : it can be hard to say no at the cruise ship buffet lines some ships have recognised the difficulties for passengers and have begun to offer healthier alternatives			0
passenger @entity97 , 27 , from @entity98 , joined a world cruise last year and was surprised to find a tailor on board whose main job was to adjust clothing that was becoming too tight			0
she said : ‘ the tailor said most people will leave the ship at least one dress size bigger			2
‘ one lady who is a regular cruise - goer said she brings larger - sized clothing to accommodate the inevitable weight gain			2
’ she added : ‘ the results do n’t surprise me – the food is constant and you ’ve got to be well restrained to resist it			2
’ celebrity chef : @entity117 has restaurants on board four of the @entity121 cruise fleet			0
