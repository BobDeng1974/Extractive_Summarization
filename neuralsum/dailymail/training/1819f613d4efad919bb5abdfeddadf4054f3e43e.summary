read @entity1 's match report from the @entity2 here @entity3 and @entity4 are the latest pundits to slam @entity7 's leaky defence after their 2 - 1 defeat by @entity9 on sunday , asking why the likes of experienced centre - half @entity11 could not organise the back line when they led at the @entity2			1
speaking on @entity15 , former @entity14 striker @entity3 blasted @entity17 's side for having so many men ahead of the ball with 16 minutes left while winning 1 - 0			1
pictures show eight yellow shirts ahead of the ball in @entity9 's half before the equaliser , with @entity25 breaking before @entity26 won a free - kick			1
the @entity29 midfielder scored the resulting set - piece before @entity25 ' winner			0
@entity3 and @entity4 believe @entity11 should have organised the defence better with @entity7 1 - 0 up , eight players were ahead of the ball as @entity9 moved forward in search of an equaliser @entity3 said : ' @entity7 have actually worked their socks off to get themselves in a winning position			1
' ten minutes later you 've got seven people ahead of the ball in the final third			2
per @entity11 should be screaming to at least two or three of them to " get back , give me some protection , we 're winning 1 - 0 , we do n't need another goal			1
' in midweek , @entity7 were 3 - 0 up against @entity47 at the @entity48 in the second half , but the @entity51 side fought back to earn a draw			1
with @entity7 leading 3 - 2 in the final moments , five of their players were ahead of the ball in the attacking final third , with the visitors going down the other end to score			1
@entity60 ( left ) ca n't hide his dismay after @entity9 's second goal as it meant @entity7 lost another lead @entity17 ( centre ) looks dejected as @entity9 take a 2 - 1 lead at the @entity2 @entity3 also admitted young defender @entity66 had an afternoon to forget in south @entity67 , tasked with marking man of the match @entity68 at right - back			1
' i am amazed @entity71 lasted so long on the pitch , ' @entity3 said			2
' he 's young , still learning , but from the first minute he struggled			0
i 'm amazed he was n't taken off			0
' former @entity7 defender @entity4 believes they should have learned from these mistakes , particularly @entity11			1
' [ @entity11 's ] in the team to organise it , get that shield in place and position people			2
' when you 're 1 - 0 up , to throw it away like they did , after what happened in midweek			1
' @entity26 ( no 23 ) brought the @entity83 back into the game with a beautiful free - kick into the top corner @entity25 ( 2nd left ) climbed highest in the @entity7 box to head home @entity9 's winner former @entity92 defender @entity91 was also scathing in his analysis of @entity17 's tactics , even referencing his summer business in the transfer market as a reason why the club are struggling			1
he added : ' @entity99 and @entity7 seem miles apart - and that 's just because [ @entity102 ] @entity101 identified what he needed			2
his team now look unstoppable as a result			0
' they let [ @entity108 ] @entity107 go and they did n't replace him , these small details always cost @entity7 at the top			0
' this stage last year they were top of the league with a healthy lead			0
the problem for @entity7 , and any team , is that you want to feel like you 're making progress			0
@entity66 ( left ) struggled to cope with @entity68 's pace ahead of @entity9 's winner @entity60 had fired @entity7 into the lead with his 12th goal of the season in all competitions ' they won the @entity124			2
the next level , having won a trophy , they should make two or three big signings			0
' but with @entity7 you never feel they 're going to make those big signings to take you there			0
' they had a better season than @entity99 , but now they feel miles apart			0
' @entity101 saw areas they needed to improve and signed in those areas			0
even from last season [ @entity7 ] look like they 've gone backwards			0
' @entity91 believes @entity7 failed to replace @entity107 in the summer video we did n't perform until the final whistle - @entity17			2

@entity7 were leading 1 - 0 with just over 15 minutes remaining at @entity9
they were ' naive ' to push for a second with eight players ahead of the ball
@entity3 and @entity4 believe @entity11 should have been more organised with the @entity7 defence late on at the @entity2
@entity7 lost 2 - 1 to fall 12 points behind @entity99
