@entity7 , was awoken by a noise outside his Â£ 165,000 semi-detached home in @entity11 , @entity12 at 1am on a night last month			1
the 58 - year - old then went to check his @entity6 monitor to see what was happening and was stunned to see two trespassers lurking outside his property , trying to break into the basement			1
but the chilling footage shows the yobs then try to break down the front door as mr @entity7 held on to the handle , as his shocked wife @entity35 , 58 , looked on in horror			1
he battled to keep the men out as they violently kicked and punched the front door causing it to splinter and glass to smash over their front hallway in an incident lasting nine minutes			1
the couple pleaded with them to leave during the ordeal while at the same time dialling 999 and eventually the pair walk off			2

yesterday mr @entity7 , who retired from @entity57 for a quieter life in the countryside in 2007 said the incident was a prime of example of @entity63			1
mr @entity7 was first alerted to the trespassers outside his home when he was awoken by a noise the retired software engineer went to check his cctv cameras , which showed the two men attempting to break into his property describing the moment he fought to keep out the intruders , mr @entity7 - who is the son of author @entity74 and brother of famous mathematician @entity71 - said : ' it was pretty brutal			1
' i have never seen anything like this happen			0
' this area has really deteriorated over the last year			2
i think people have tried to burgle us three or four times in the last year			2
' about a year ago thieves broke in and stole a @entity84 and lots of gadgets and laptops and things , and that 's when i decided to get the cctv installed			1
' it was quite terrifying and it all happened while i was completely naked			0
' i was holding the handle and leaning on the door with my full weight but they were still breaking though			1
' i told them i was recording them and you would think they would leave after that but they just got more irate			0
mr @entity7 , right and his wife @entity35 , pictured outside their home had to fight to keep out the intruders while they waited for the police to arrive ' we were so frightened and every time i moved away from the door a little bit it squeaked so i thought they were still there so i ended up hard against the door until the police arrived			1
' at one point they left and then came back and picked up a little black canister which i think was pepper spray			0
' i think they were wanting to break through the door , pepper spray my wife and i , then just rob the place anyway			1
' i was ok because i 'm quite fit for my age , but if it had just been my wife in it could have been so much worse			0
' this area is nice during the day with mums and pushchairs , you hear a lot of laughing			0
but it 's a different place after dark			2
it 's changed my view of humanity			2
' the 58 - year - old was forced to hold on the door handle of the front door , pictured , to stop the men from breaking in the footage shows the men at first loitering outside the property and talking on their phones			1
several times they come to the house and then walk away again - clearly showing their faces to the camera			2
after a while they return and open the gate at the basement of the house before repeatedly kicking the door			1
in the footage , after his wife says ' call the police @entity158 ' defiant mr @entity7 can be heard calmly saying : ' i 'm recording it			1
i want to catch his voice as well as his face			0
before he adds : ' i 'm recording you on a camera and i 'm recording you doing what you 're doing at the door and i 'm going to report you to the police			2
' the thug then replies : ' you f * * * ing , f * * * ing idiot			0
' the force of which the men tried to batter down the front door caused the door to splinter and caused glass to smash all over their hallway but mrs @entity25 , who used to teach for the @entity179 , said the incident would not scare them away from the area			1
she added : ' we were petrified			0
the whole incident was terrifying			0
but we will not allow them to drive us out of this house			0
' we moved here from @entity188 , when we semi-retired and it is paradise			0
the @entity6 does reassure me and we love living here			0
they will not make us leave			0
