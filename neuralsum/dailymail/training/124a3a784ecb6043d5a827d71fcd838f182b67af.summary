gamma rays are the most powerful form of radioactive waves known in the universe			1
but how these mysterious waves are made , and where exactly they come from have baffled scientists for years			0
now , for the first time , scientists have peered into the heart of an erupting star to uncover the origin of this stunning phenomenon			0
gamma rays , emitted when a star explodes , are the most powerful form of radioactive waves known in the universe			1
but how these mysterious waves were made and where exactly they come from have baffled scientists for years			0
pictured is an artist 's impression of gas ejected in the nova explosion astronomers , led by @entity23 and @entity24 , made an unexpected discovery when looking at an explosion on the surface of a star			0
' we not only found where the gamma rays came from , but also got a look at a previously - unseen scenario that may be common in other nova explosions , ' said @entity35 , of @entity23			1
a nova occurs in a star that is part of a binary system – two stars orbiting one another			2
one star , known as a dense white dwarf , steals matter from the other and the interaction triggers a thermonuclear explosion that flings debris into space			2
it was from this explosion from a system known as @entity53 , located some 5,000 light - years from @entity54 , that the researchers think the gamma rays were emitted			1

artist ’s impressions of the gas ejected in the nova explosion is pictured this activity was first detected two years ago by @entity68 's @entity67			1
at about that same time , similar activity was being picked up by land - based radio telescopes around the world , revealing two distinct knots of radio emission			1
these knots were then seen to move away from each other			0
astronomers have found the brightest ‘ dead star ’ ever recorded - but its very existence threatens to underpin our known laws of the universe			0
the pulsar - a dense and rapidly spinning remnant of a much larger star left over from a supernova explosion - has the energy of about 10 million suns and was previously thought to be a black hole			0
its discovery , however , breaks a theoretical limit for how bright such an object can get - and it may also mean many other black holes found to date are actually pulsars			0
the discovery , published in the journal nature , was made by scientists at @entity68 ’s @entity99 ( @entity99 ) using the @entity100 ( @entity100 )			0
this pulsar is the remnant of a once - in - a - century supernova dubbed @entity104 that was spotted in the @entity105 , also known as @entity105 ( @entity105 ) , 12 million light - years away			0
the rare event captured the attention of telescopes around the world but when astronomers looked at @entity100 ’s data they found that what they thought was a black hole was actually the brightest pulsar ever seen			0
scientists believe the white dwarf and its companion gave up some of their orbital energy to boost some of the explosion material , making the ejected material move outward faster in the plane of their orbit			2
later , the white dwarf blew off a faster wind of particles moving mostly outward along the poles of the orbital plane			1
when the faster - moving polar flow hit the slower - moving material , the shock accelerated particles to the speeds needed to produce the gamma rays , and the knots of radio emission			1
this artist 's impression is believed to be the exact replica of the moment a star explodes			0
when the faster - moving polar flow hits the slower - moving material , the shock accelerated particles to the speeds needed to produce the gamma rays , and the knots of radio emission ' by watching this system over time , and seeing how the pattern of radio emission changed , then tracing the movements of the knots , we saw the exact behaviour expected from this scenario , ' professor @entity35 said			1
since that initial detection by @entity67 , the spacecraft has detected gamma rays from three additional nova explosions in other star systems			1
' this mechanism may be common to such systems , ' said professor @entity35			0
' the reason the gamma rays were first seen in @entity53 is because it 's closer to us			1
' because the type of ejection detected in @entity53 also is seen in other binary star systems , the new insights might help astronomers understand how those systems develop			1
' we may be able to use novae as a ' testbed ' for improving our understanding of this critical stage of binary evolution , ' professor @entity35 said			0
gamma rays can be dangerous and are capable of killing living cells			2
the medical field uses gamma rays , along with x-rays and other forms of high - energy radiation , to treat cancer			2
fortunately , by the time gamma rays travel across the universe to us , they are absorbed by the @entity54 's atmosphere .			2

@entity68 's @entity190 detected gamma ray activity in 2012
other telescopes also revealed two knots of radio emission activity
@entity198 and @entity199 scientists looked at a binary star system known as @entity53
white dwarf blew off fast - moving particles , which hit slower - moving ones
