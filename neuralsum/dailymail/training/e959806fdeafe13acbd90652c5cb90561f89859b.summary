’ a handlebar mounted device ( pictured left ) gives cyclists the speed and distance of vehicles coming up behind them , while a rear - mounted smart light ( right ) warns drivers of a cyclist 's presence by flashing increasingly furiously the closer they get comprised of two gadgets that clip onto a bike , the system has been designed to allay fears of being hit from behind by a car			1

‘ @entity41 really serves as a sixth sense , giving you information so you can make the best decisions in a situation , ’ mr @entity98 added			2
a band of @entity39 computer scientists and engineers created @entity41 to give cyclists a ' sixth sense '			1

@entity39 engineers created the cycling radar , which gives riders the speed and distance of vehicles coming up behind them

*inventors* claim device gives cyclists a ' sixth sense ' and boosts their safety
@entity152 are raising money to put the device into production , which is expected to ship in december and can be *pre-ordered* from $ 199 ( *£* *116* )
