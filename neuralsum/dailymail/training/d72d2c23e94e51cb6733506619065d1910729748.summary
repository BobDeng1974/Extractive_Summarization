by @entity1 reporter swapping the lab for nightclubs has proved a smart career move for dr @entity5			2
the first class honours graduate and lecturer was top of her class at the @entity9 , spending her day in a white coat and sensible shoes			2
but now , she has reinvented herself as @entity12 , a pole dancer and burlesque performer who wears hot pants and towering heels			1
she took up the pole when looking for a new form of exercise to get her in shape while she was studying for her phd			2
and her inspiration came in the form of an @entity32 pole dancer			1
' she was brilliant , ' said @entity12 , a former gymnast who grew up in @entity33			1
' she was sexy and she had boobs and a bum ! she had a great figure without being stick thin			0
i learned a lot from her and eventually i took over her classes			0
' i finished my phd and took on a brief lectureship at @entity42 , but juggling my pole classes with a full - time job was hard work			1
@entity12 said she has n't looked back since leaving her job as a lecturer in medicinal chemistry to launch her own dance school ' i started off with four girls and , by the end of 2011 , i was teaching 40 girls on a regular basis			1
i knew i had to make a decision			0
i was starting to compete and i could n't do everything			0
' i decided to leave my job at the university and concentrate all of my efforts into @entity59			0
' i now teach around 150 people a week and it 's the best thing i 've ever done			1
' in the past three years , @entity12 has travelled the length and breadth of the @entity64 performing and competing in pole dancing competitions			1
in 2012 , she picked up the @entity64 @entity66 and is number one in teaching @entity69 pole dancing			1
she also has a permanent residency at @entity72 bar in @entity33			0
' @entity5 said : ' i started off with four girls and , by the end of 2011 , i was teaching 40 girls on a regular basis			2
i knew i had to make a decision			0
i was starting to compete and i could n't do everything			0
' she said : ' some people say i 've wasted a good education by becoming a professional pole dancer and teaching my classes , but they 're wrong			1
' i loved my job as a lecturer and i love science , but it began to feel a bit suffocating			0
' i 'm one of those people who likes being my own boss and using what i 've learned to help others			0
' i work with a lot of victims of domestic abuse and i do work with victims of rape			0
if dancing helps them and rehabilitates them in any way then i feel i 've done my job			2
' seeing my dance students develop and become healthier over time brings me so much satisfaction			1
