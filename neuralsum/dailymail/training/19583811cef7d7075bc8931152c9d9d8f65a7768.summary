@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7			2
1 ) @entity8 has his own way of answering the group of @entity12 fans who have booed him since he left in 2009			1
@entity15 ’s 3 - 0 success at @entity16 on saturday took his record against the club where he made 441 appearances in nearly 12 years to seven wins from nine @entity5 matches – with a goal difference of 19 - 4			1
the 33 - year - old rubbed it in with yet another man - of - the - match display , covering more miles than any player on the pitch and finding a team mate with 81 of his 86 passes			1
@entity8 rubbed it in the @entity12 fans ' faces with a man - of - the - match performance for @entity15 2 ) it ’s not a coincidence that @entity37 has saved three of the last five penalties he ’s faced – the @entity41 goalkeeper does his homework			1
@entity43 had put four of his last five successful penalties to the goalkeeper ’s bottom right hand corner – exactly where @entity48 no 1 @entity37 dived to keep out the @entity51 striker ’s effort on saturday			1
@entity37 had done his homework and that is why he saved @entity43 's penalty for @entity51 3 ) @entity54 has always prided himself on passing football but his current @entity57 side are even struggling on that score			1
for all the problems they caused @entity61 their accuracy rate of just 68.8 per cent was the lowest of any @entity5 team all weekend			2
maybe that ’s why they are struggling so badly to score – five of their six @entity5 goals this season have now come from set - pieces			1
@entity54 's @entity57 side are struggling in the @entity5 , and can not keep possession 4 ) @entity73 has four goals in five games for @entity76 now – as many as he scored in 41 appearances for @entity78 in the whole of last season			1
but it ’s not just putting the ball in the net where he looks a different player			0
against @entity85 he was a huge influence in midfield , winning nine tackles and involved in 22 duels for the ball – more than any other @entity5 player all weekend			0
@entity73 ( left ) celebrates his goal against @entity85 and has scored four in five games for @entity76 5 ) slightly built @entity51 youngster @entity93 , tiny in @entity5 terms at just 5ft 9in , could have picked an easier place than @entity96 to make his @entity5 debut for @entity98 after joining them on loan for the season			1
but the 22 - year - old rose well to the challenge , giving the ball away only five times during his 65 minutes			0
the 5.4 miles he ran was a fraction further than striker @entity108 managed in 90			0
boss @entity109 likens him to former @entity113 midfielder @entity112 , and the way he stood up to 6ft 4in opponent @entity115 shows promise for the future			0
@entity93 ( right ) stood up well to the giants of @entity96 for @entity98 and tackles @entity119 6 ) @entity120 is refusing to give up on staying at @entity121 – even though the club tried to sell him in the summer and his contract runs out in seven months time			1
the 29 - year - old defender , picked for the first time since a 0 - 0 draw at @entity12 in august , played a huge role in keeping @entity128 to only three attempts at goal			0
in four appearances including @entity134 ties this season , passionate @entity131 has finished on the winning side three times			0
@entity120 impressed against @entity128 and here he muscles out @entity139 7 ) new @entity142 manager @entity141 ’s biggest problem in the next week could be persuading @entity143 to extend the month ’s loan of @entity145 , which is due to run out			0
@entity141 had taken one point from three games before @entity145 turned up , now the 4 - 2 win over @entity150 means he ’s got 10 from the four matches in which the 33 - year - old has played			2
meanwhile , @entity143 boss @entity153 , who had n’t picked @entity145 for a championship game all season , has not won a single match of four with his team scoring only two goals			1
@entity141 's @entity142 are impressing , but he will struggle to keep @entity145 on loan 8 ) @entity161 ’s team selection during his time at @entity163 was constantly bizarre – the @entity164 never named an unchanged side in his 20 games in charge and fans started playing ‘ @entity170 ’ trying to guess the next line - up			2
that ’s all changed since @entity172 has taken over – bringing @entity173 into his defence in place of the injured @entity176 was only the fourth change he ’s made in six games as caretaker			2
small wonder that @entity172 , the popular choice to stay in charge at @entity182 , has overseen four wins in that time			0
@entity172 is keeping things simple at @entity163 - he has made just four changes in six games and it 's working 9 ) @entity188 signed 11 new players for @entity190 in the summer and has got another four on loan – but the wholesale changes are taking time to have an effect			2
a 5 - 3 thrashing at @entity195 meant the former @entity12 and @entity57 boss , who had n’t managed in @entity48 for six years before he took over the @entity198 club , has seen his side ship nine goals in two games			1
@entity188 called it ‘ embarrassing ’ and admitted his players got bullied			0
@entity190 are 15th in the table – exactly where they were when he took over last december			0
@entity206 ( right ) celebrates his hat - trick goal for @entity195 against ' embarrassing ' @entity190 10 ) @entity208 must have looked with envy at how @entity210 followed up collecting a manager of the month award			0
while @entity213 boss @entity210 celebrated the honour by watching his side spank @entity216 8 - 0 , @entity208 has seen his @entity218 side crash since he won the @entity220 prize for four wins out of five in september			0
since then the @entity222 have struggled – the 1 - 1 draw at @entity224 was their first point in three games and there ’s a tough trip to @entity229 to come on tuesday night .			2

@entity8 was man of the match for @entity15 against his former club
@entity37 knew exactly where @entity43 was going to put his penalty
@entity57 are struggling to put passes together under @entity54
@entity73 has scored four goals in five games for @entity76
