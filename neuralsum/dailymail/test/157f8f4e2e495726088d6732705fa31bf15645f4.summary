' there 's been a huge weight lifted off my shoulders since winning the world title			1
it 's what i always wanted to do and i 've been touted as a champion for years and if i never got it i would have been disappointed			2
now the monkey is off my back and i can just box and show people who i am			2
' we 've made physical and tactical improvements in the gym since the last fight and hopefully they 'll show up in the ring on saturday			2
' i think this could be a technical fight or it could be a bit of a fire fight			2
it 's going to be a little of both at times			2
there will be moments where we 're looking at each other , figuring each other out , but once we exchange it could be explosive			0
' @entity6 is sure of himself , but he has to be , i have the same mentality			1
you have to be to compete in this sport			0
' fighting at home like @entity6 is on saturday , brings a different kind of pressure to the table , it 's the pressure of expectations and people you know coming to the fights			1
that 's also pressure and i know all about that			0
@entity6 is a former champion but is yet to taste defeat as a professional and poses a tough challenge for @entity0 @entity6 says he has faced struggles his whole life and that this fight will just be the latest in a long line ' i have n't needed to build up my confidence for this fight			1
it 's not time to think			0
it 's time to do what i 've been doing every day in the gym			0
' @entity6 , meanwhile , believes the fight will just be another struggle he has to overcome			1
' i never trailed in a fight and came back and won like @entity0			1
i 've just won all the time right out of the gate			2

' it 's a big fight for him and a big fight for me			0
he 's a smart fighter when he 's in trouble so i have to watch out for that			0
most importantly i just need to be true to myself			0
' a lot of people had @entity0 as the underdog in his last fight but he came out and did great			1
that 's the thing about boxing ; one punch can change the fight			0
' i 'm getting paid for 12 rounds so i 'm preparing for 12 rounds but if i can get him out of there early i will			0
' my whole life has been struggles and i 've had to overcome every single one of those struggles			0
this is going to be no different from that			0
' being a father of course made me more inspired and watching my uncle pass has made me more motivated than ever to accomplish everything i want			0
