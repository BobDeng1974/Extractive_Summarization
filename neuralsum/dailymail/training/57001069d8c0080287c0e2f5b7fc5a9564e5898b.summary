the set and the name will also be changed , according to show insiders			2
revamp : @entity3 's @entity2 , currently presented by @entity16 and @entity17 pictured , could be renamed @entity4 in a bid to make the show more news focused and boost viewing figures the latest plans comes just 12 months after presenters @entity17 and @entity16 were brought in to boost the struggling show			1
it also follows reports that mr @entity16 faced the axe following disappointing viewing figures , and could be replaced by @entity29 ’ @entity30 on a £ 750,000 salary			2
staff were called into a meeting last week about the future of the programme , according to the @entity36			0
an @entity3 spokesperson said : ' our new director of daytime @entity39 is looking at the whole of the @entity40 schedule and @entity2 is part of this			2
axed ? reports in august suggested that @entity46 singer @entity16 , pictured , could face the axe following unimpressive viewing figures ' @entity16 and @entity17 are fantastic presenters and remain a key part of plans moving forward			1
' the new director has been conducting a review of the channel over the last month and allegedly told the meeting - which was attended by all the top presenters - about her plan to shake - up the show			1
she indicated she wanted presenters to sit on more formal chairs and the current bright , colourful set will be given a complete makeover			2
the possibility of changing the name of the show was also discussed - although no concrete date was set			0
the name @entity4 , regarded as the most likely replacement insiders , is expected to come within the next year			0
one insider told the people that bosses are desperate for the show to be a success and regain the viewing figures of @entity76			0
they said : ' every detail of the show is being looked at and they are willing to try anything to make the show more attractive to the viewer			0
' @entity76 started broadcasting in 1993 and was presented by @entity30 and @entity84			0
some of the country 's best loved presenters - including @entity87 and @entity88 - presented the show over its 17 - year run			1
after losing some of its best presenters and a slump in viewing figures , @entity3 announced a major overhaul , with @entity76 renamed @entity2			1
@entity2 debuted in september 2010 with presenters @entity95 and @entity97			1
the duo left the @entity10 ’s @entity99 for the morning slot for a sizable salary increase			0
@entity2 's predecessor , @entity76 , ran from 1993 until 2010			2
some of the country 's best loved presenters sat on the @entity76 sofa , including @entity87 and @entity88			0
@entity2 debuted in september 2010 with presenters @entity95 and @entity97 , who left the @entity10 's @entity99 for the morning slot			1
they were removed in 2011 due to poor ratings , with @entity108 and @entity109 taking over the sofa			0
in september 2012 , @entity17 and @entity16 were introduced with viewing figures increasing from 500,000 to around one million			1
however , ratings soon slumped , leaving rival @entity10 to double its viewers			1
eventually , @entity97 and @entity95 were removed from the show in november 2011 - with @entity108 and @entity109 taking over			0
within the year , @entity17 - who also presents her self - titled morning show - and former @entity46 singer @entity16 took over			1
it was hope that the move — instigated by former @entity10 chief @entity118 — would boost viewing figures from 500,000 to more than a million			2
figures have consistently peaked around the one million mark since the pair took over - 500,000 short of their @entity10 rivals			0
the new name will inevitably call comparisons to @entity126 , which was broadcaster @entity128 ’s flagship programme in the 1980s			0
it was famously presented by @entity130 .			0

channel bosses want @entity2 to be more ' newsy ' in bid to boost ratings
show currently has *1million* viewers , compared to @entity10 's 1.5million
change , thought to be brought in within the year , would include set revamp
comes just 12 months after presenters @entity17 and @entity16 were brought in to *salvage* show
