by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 15:39 est , 3 july 2012 @entity1 has released details of a telephone conversation between chief executive @entity4 and the @entity5 which @entity1 believes led to systematic falsifying of @entity8 submissions			2
an email account of the conversation is included in written evidence submitted to the @entity12 in advance of mr @entity4 's appearance before @entity15 tomorrow			1
@entity1 claims the dialogue between mr @entity4 and @entity17 , the deputy governor of the @entity5 , was the ultimate cause of @entity8 submissions being altered downwards			1
lost in translation : @entity4 ( left ) told @entity17 ( right ) that he thought other banks were posting @entity8 submissions that were too low			2
@entity4 told colleagues the @entity5 man told him @entity1 did not always appear as high as they did			2
the email is dated 30 october 2008 and was sent by mr @entity4 to then chairman @entity25 and @entity26 , who today stepped down from the position of chief operating officer			1
in it , mr @entity4 explains that mr @entity17 had told him that he had received calls from ' senior figures within @entity32 ' who had expressed concern about the high rates being reported by @entity1 and wanted them lowered			1
the email reports that mr @entity4 asked mr @entity17 to explain to the @entity32 figures his belief that other banks were submitting @entity8 rates lower than their actual transactions , which had the effect of making @entity1 appear out of step			1
' misunderstanding ' : @entity42 who resigned from @entity1 today , apparently took the email as an instruction to lower the libor rate the email from mr @entity4 concludes that ' while ( mr @entity17 ) was certain we did not need advice , that it did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as have recently '			1
this last sentence , it appears , was taken by mr @entity26 as an instruction from mr @entity4 to lower @entity8 submissions , and he then passed this instruction to the @entity8 submitters			1
the written evidence makes clear that mr @entity4 did not subsequently believe mr @entity17 had made such an instruction , or that he had intended to give such an instruction to mr @entity26			1
the evidence also outlines how in 2008 @entity1 repeatedly raised the issue of other banks posting @entity8 submissions that appeared too low			0
in the written evidence , the bank said : ' @entity1 was consistently raising concerns with the @entity63 ( trade body that compiles @entity8 ) , questioning why other banks â€™ libor submissions appeared to be so high compared to those of @entity1			0
many of these concerns were based upon @entity1 observations that other banks were making submissions which were lower than levels at which they appeared to be undertaking transactions			0
' that will raise question for the @entity63 to answer about how it responded to @entity1 's alerts of possible @entity8 errors			0
@entity1 boss @entity4 has released a memo documenting a phone call he had with the @entity5 's deputy governor about the bank 's submissions regarding @entity8			1
the memo was sent on october 30 , 2008 , to the then - chief executive @entity25 and @entity42 , who was president of @entity86			2
@entity87 is @entity4 and stands for @entity88			0
here is the memo in full : file note : call to red from @entity17 , @entity92 : 29th october 2008 further to our last call , mr @entity17 reiterated that he had received calls from a number of senior figures within @entity32 to question why @entity1 was always towards the top end of @entity8 pricing			1
his response was ' you have to pay what you have to pay '			0
i asked if he could relay the reality , that not all banks were providing quotes at the levels that represented real transactions , his response ' oh , that would be worse '			0
i explained again our market rate driven policy and that it had recently meant that we appeared in the top quartile and on occasion the top decile of the pricing			0
equally , i noted that we continued to see others in the market posting rates at levels that were not representative of where they would actually undertake business			0
this latter point has on occasion pushed us higher than would otherwise appear to be the case			0
in fact , we are not having to ' pay up ' for money at all			0
mr @entity17 stated the levels of calls he was receiving from @entity32 were ' senior ' and that while he was certain we did not need advice , that it did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as we have recently .			2

email sent in 2008 by @entity4 after his conversation with @entity135 deputy governor @entity17
@entity86 boss @entity137 received the email and ' misunderstood ' the instructions
he then told staff to artificially lower libor rates submissions
@entity26 followed @entity4 in quitting today
email *revealed* ahead of mr @entity4 's appearance at @entity12 tomorrow
memo from @entity17 points *finger* at @entity32
