by @entity0 published : 19:45 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:45 est , 17 february 2014 @entity3 sually avoided the scales , and was appalled to discover her weight had shot up to more than 11st @entity6 was in for a shock when the nurse at her asthma clinic asked her to step on to the scales			1
' my doctor had retired and i changed to a new surgery where they had an asthma clinic , ' says @entity3 , 45 , a hairdresser from @entity16 in @entity17			1
' they saw on my notes that i suffered from asthma , but this was the first time anyone in the medical profession had weighed me			1
' ' she took a sharp breath and made a face , so i knew it was n't good news , ' says @entity3			0
like many women , she usually avoided the scales , and was appalled to discover her weight had shot up to more than 11st			1
at only 5ft 2in tall this made her officially obese			0
' the problem was that i did n't feel fat because the weight had crept on so gradually during and after my pregnancies , ' says @entity3			1
' then when the children left things on their plates , i 'd pick at the leftovers			0
' @entity3 was also struggling increasingly to manage her asthma , making simple tasks such as walking up the stairs and looking after her children , @entity43 , now 12 , and @entity44 , nine , more difficult			1
the asthma clinic nurse advised her to lose weight and said it would reduce her asthma symptoms			1
it was a real wake - up call , says @entity3			0
' i knew that i had to do something about it or my asthma would just get worse because i would become more immobile and reluctant to exercise			1
' there is a clear link between obesity and asthma attacks , as @entity57 , clinical lead nurse at the charity asthma @entity58 , explains : ' obese people find their asthma much harder to control			1
' it seems they do n't respond as well to treatment as people who are a healthy weight			1
indeed , a recent study by @entity68 in @entity69 , involving more than 600 patients at severe asthma clinics across the @entity58 , found that patients with a @entity73 of more than 30 were more likely to need the steroid prednisolone - used to reduce inflammation in the airways - and to resort to their inhalers more often			1
but as dr @entity78 , a consultant in respiratory medicine at @entity68 , says : ' unfortunately , one of the side - effects of prednisolone is increased appetite and weight gain , so patients are more inclined to find activity difficult			1
' it 's a vicious circle , but if an asthma sufferer can break that cycle and lose weight , the benefits will be obvious			1
' @entity3 's asthma started when she was 19 , triggered by a severe bout of flu			1
upper respiratory infections are often caused by cold and flu viruses and are a common trigger of asthma			1
@entity3 lost a stone - and - a - half and it made a huge difference , bringing the asthma under control ' i had the flu jab when i was 19 , but i was one of the unlucky people who contracted the flu badly , ' she says			2
her asthma started to affect her daily life			2
' getting up the stairs was very scary because the wheezing was so loud			0
and it stayed at the same level in my 30s and into my 40s			0
i could n't run after the children at the park			0
' since being diagnosed with asthma , @entity3 has used a brown preventer inhaler each morning to build up a constant level of protection and a stronger , fast - acting @entity122 version when symptoms worsen			2
this would tend to happen in winter , and also if she was stressed or had been in contact with pet hair , particularly rabbits			0
as well as losing weight , @entity3 embarked on an exercise regimen - which can be a brave step for an asthma sufferer , as many worry that increased activity will spark an attack			1
the amount spent on treating and caring for people with asthma each year but , in fact , exercise is good for asthmatics because it improves their lung capacity			2
done carefully , it should n't be risky			0
and , for @entity3 , the regimen has been a life - changer			0
after seeking advice from the @entity148 website , she took up jogging			0
as well as running four miles three times a week , she started going to a weekly spinning class , while cycling short distances instead of using the car soon became part of her routine			0
' i lost a stone - and - a - half in eight months and it made a huge difference , ' says @entity3			0
' it really brought the asthma under control and made the attacks less frequent and less severe - i have just one a month instead of three a week			2
' she can now also run up the stairs			0
' when i was 11st , my body was struggling to cope with the weight , especially climbing stairs , but the fitter you are , the stronger your lungs become			2
' @entity3 's experience is backed up by @entity58			0
' if you can exercise , this will expand the airways , and improve your lung function , ' says @entity57			0
' following a low - fat , low - sugar diet and getting rid of weight , especially around the middle , will make a big difference			2
it 's all about changing your behaviour and lifestyle			0
' @entity78 suggests that people with asthma should look closely at their whole lifestyle , stop smoking , avoid pets which aggravate the condition , and take up exercise gradually , especially walking , swimming and cycling			2
when it comes to exercise , he recommends taking a friend with you when you first start , stopping your work - out to rest if wheezing starts and choosing gentle , age - appropriate exercises to begin			0
' weight loss and exercise are not a magic bullet for asthma , but they can help enormously , ' adds dr @entity78			1
as for @entity6 , she 's delighted that her asthma is now under control			1
but that day at the asthma clinic is so vivid and humiliating that she still steers clear of the scales			1
' i still do n't weigh myself very often , but now i have a pair of size 12 jeans and i try them on once a week			0
' i know that if they do n't fit then i have to try just that bit harder to keep the weight off , ' she says			2
