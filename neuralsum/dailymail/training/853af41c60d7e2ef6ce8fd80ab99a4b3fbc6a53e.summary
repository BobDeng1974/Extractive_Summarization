' i thought of myself as the one with the brains instead , and for years i was happy with putting myself in that box			2
then when i reached my late 20s i decided i wanted what every other girl does - a great wardrobe and an enviable figure			2
' i ’d started to transform myself by going to the gym and dieting , and was feeling much better about myself			2
' but then the accident happened , and instead of battling to drop the pounds i found myself fighting to even survive			2
' the van struck her with such force that she was catapulted more than 40 metres down the road			1

so as soon as i was able to , i started pushing myself			0
' the medical staff thought i would never be able to do it , but i remember willing myself on to prove them wrong			0
' at one point doctors had even considered amputating my damaged right calf			0
' thankfully they did n’t have to , but it shocked me to realise i did n’t just want to use my leg to walk , i wanted to run			0
' incredibly , in the months after the collision in september 2003 miss @entity6 started regular gym visits , and swapped the fast food of her previous life for healthier , more nutritious options			1

' but it ’s not all about the exterior , the most important thing to me is my health			0
' i ’m a total gym addict , and although i still suffer from after effects from the accident i do n’t let obstacles get in my way			0
for example , i ca n’t use the treadmill because my balance is off , so instead i use the cross trainer			0
' i believe the only reason i survived the accident is because i ’d started going to the gym so my heart was stronger			0
