@entity0 , from the @entity1 , says @entity3 's plans to soften spending cuts would add £ 170billion to the national debt by 2030 @entity3 's pledge to soften spending cuts in power would mean borrowing up to £ 50billion a year more by 2020 than the @entity10 , a respected think - tank said last night			1
@entity0 , director of the @entity1 , claimed @entity12 's plans would add £ 170billion to the national debt by 2030			1
this would mean greater risks for the economy and make it much harder for the @entity17 to withstand economic shocks in future years , he wrote in @entity19			1
the @entity1 also said families with children have been among the biggest losers since the @entity23 came to power			2
it found while pensioners have been protected by tax and benefit changes since 2010 , families with children ' have lost more on average than other household types '			1
the report questions @entity34 's promise to lead the most family - friendly government ever – and will cause alarm among @entity38 mps ahead of may 's poll			1
' the overall effect of tax and benefit changes implemented since january 2010 has been to hit the richest hardest , to take benefits away from the poorer half of the income distribution , and largely protect those on middle and upper middle incomes , ' said mr @entity0			0
' pensioners have also largely been protected while families with children have lost out			1
' lest there be any doubt , there is a big difference between £ 7 billion of cuts and £ 33 billion of cuts			0
' if you take the plans set out in the autumn statement at face value , spending cuts of more than £ 50 billion could be required after 2015/16			2
' he added : ' the problem is that another recession will strike one day			0
going into a new recession with debt still high - and it is higher now than at any time since the late 1960s - could leave less room for manoeuvre			0
' the sort of additional borrowing that we are able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed			0
' conservative plans will prove tough to deliver , mr @entity0 suggested			2
he wrote : ' under the autumn statement plans , conservatives could be cutting unprotected budgets by 26 % after 2015/16 or an extraordinary 41 % over the period from 2010			0
mr @entity0 said @entity12 's , left , plan to soften spending cuts would mean borrowing up to £ 50billion a year more by 2020 than the @entity10			1
he also questioned @entity34 's , right , promise to lead the most family - friendly government ever ' even just to meet their more modest fiscal target , these budgets would need to be cut by more than 15 % after 2015/16			1
' @entity3 would need to implement cuts of just 3 %			2
' he pointed out that conservatives would want to achieve a surplus on the overall budget and do not want to borrow to invest			0
' that means they would need to find spending cuts of around £ 33 billion after 2015/16 , ' he added			2
changes made by the @entity23 mean families where one parent is earning more than £ 50,000 a year are no longer able to claim the £ 20.50 a week for an eldest or only child and £ 13.55 a week for subsequent children			0
mr @entity0 said understanding the economic facts ' should be crucial to the choices people make ' on polling day			0
@entity100 won some backing for its claim that the deficit had halved under the @entity23 – but it was told it was still far bigger than planned			0
the @entity1 said annual borrowing is on course to fall from 10.2 per cent of national income in 2009 - 10 to 5 per cent this year – £ 90billion against a planned £ 45billion .			1

@entity1 say @entity3 plans would add £ 170billion of debt
