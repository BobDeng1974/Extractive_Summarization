@entity0 believes @entity3 's @entity2 victory over @entity4 can help ' reopen a few scars ' from last winter 's miserable @entity7 tour			1
@entity4 were whitewashed in the @entity9 series down under and also lost both limited - overs legs , leaving the country humiliated and downtrodden			1
a year later they are back for a three - way one - day contest , which also involves @entity15 , before the @entity16 in @entity3 and @entity17			1
@entity18 ( left ) was dismissed off the bowling of @entity0 ( centre ) in the first ball of the match @entity0 ( second left ) celebrates with his @entity24 team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity18 in the opening over their time away got off to a familiar start at the @entity29 , where the home side claimed a three - wicket victory with a massive 61 balls to spare			1
@entity0 may not have had a big part to play in @entity4 's previous woes , but he started the rot this time by dismissing @entity18 and @entity36 for ducks in the first over of the day			1
' hopefully we reopened a few scars tonight , ' said the left - arm paceman			2
' they 're going to have to be out here for a few months now with this tri-series and the @entity16 so there 's no better way to kick off our campaign than getting one above them			2
' i think we played really well with bat and ball , showed great intensity , and the only way to go is to try and improve on that			0
' @entity3 got off to the best possible start , and @entity0 ( centre ) hopes they can continue it through the series @entity18 leaves the @entity29 pitch after being dismissed off the first ball of the match @entity0 , who finished with four for 42 , took man - of - the - match honours off @entity66 and @entity67 , who made 121 and 127 respectively			1
his speed helped rout @entity4 's top order and with @entity72 and the rested @entity73 also capable of serious pace , @entity0 feels that could be a key difference between the sides			1
' i guess blokes bowling at 140 - 145kmph ( 87 - 90mph ) plus is handy			0
it has that intimidation factor towards some of the batsmen , ' he said			0
' it 's also about execution but having that pace is good			2
@entity72 bowled a few at 150kmph today and we obviously have @entity88 coming back in at some point bowling rapid as well			0
it 's a great combination			2
' @entity66 excelled with the bat on his bow as @entity4 's permanent one - day captain , his century lifting the tourists towards respectability after slumping to 33 for four			1
@entity0 ( right ) took four for 42 and was named man - of - the - match after his impressive performance @entity0 was all smiles at the end of the match , as @entity3 cruised to victory with 61 balls remaining but the comprehensive defeat , which saw @entity3 claim a bonus point , meant he struggled to enjoy the moment			1
' overall i 'm really disappointed , ' he said			0
' we came into the game with a lot of good preparation under our belt and within the side we would have had a lot of expectation on ourselves , so we have a lot of disappointed guys in the changing room			0
' we 're going to have to dust ourselves off and come back in four days ( against @entity15 )			0
' there are certain positives we can take from the game but ultimately being four down so early has cost us			0
' simply , we were n't good enough to adapt the wicket and play accordingly			0
' they bowled well up front , but nothing that we should n't be capable of dealing with			0
' @entity4 fly to @entity128 on saturday before taking on the @entity129 at the @entity130 on tuesday .			2
