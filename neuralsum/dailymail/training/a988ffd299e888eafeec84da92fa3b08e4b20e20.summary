by @entity0 more than a million people in the @entity2 now live with a condition that causes the heart to beat irregularly and can lead to strokes			1

more than a million people in the @entity2 now have atrial fibrillation - a condition which causes the heart to beat irregularly and too fast high blood pressure , heart valve disease and binge drinking are among the causes alongside the fact people are living longer			1
the heart condition causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate , frequently leading to dizziness and shortness of breath			1
sufferers may also feel palpitations and become very tired			0
however , some people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms and are completely unaware that their heart rate is irregular			1
if left untreated , atrial fibrillation can significantly increase the risk of a blood clot forming inside the heart , which increases the risk of stroke five-fold			1
the @entity7 said atrial fibrillation is responsible for 22,500 strokes a year in the @entity2			1
people who have atrial fibrillation are five times more likely to have a stroke than people who do not			1
image shows a scan of a brain with a stroke @entity50 , chief executive of the charity , said : ‘ the real danger with atrial fibrillation is that some people do n't realise they have it			1
you can be going about your daily routine oblivious to the fact you 're five times more likely to have a devastating stroke			2

but only through research can we tackle this dangerous disorder and prevent its devastating consequences			0

‘ i did n't tell my wife about the risk of stroke until i was on medication to help prevent it			2
‘ i did n't want to worry her and the children			0
but every tiny ache or twinge still makes me panic that something could be starting that could devastate my family			0
‘ i 'm currently waiting for further treatment , so i 'm not out of the woods yet			0
more research , funded by the @entity68 up the @entity93 campaign , could help find better ways of treating people like me and make sure my family stays together			2
‘ we 're all set to dig out our reddest outfits for the occasion and i hope thousands of other families will join in too			0
