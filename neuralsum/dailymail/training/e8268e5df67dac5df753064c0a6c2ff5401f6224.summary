more than 2,000 people have been tested for @entity1 and hepatitis amid concerns a dentist flouting infection control rules put them at risk of contracting blood - borne viruses			1
@entity9 's alleged refusal to follow @entity11 safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days			1
@entity14 said today 2,403 people have contacted a helpline established to offer advice to former patients			2
a spokeswoman confirmed 2,258 former patients have had blood tests to establish if they are at risk			1
but they face an anxious wait , with results not expected for 14 days , the spokeswoman told @entity27			2
a whistleblower has alleged mr @entity9 re-used dirty equipment and failed to change his gloves between patients			1
and it emerged the latest @entity34 report by health inspectors who examined the surgery in july found medical equipment was stored in a staff toilet , posing ' a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated '			2
dentist @entity9 is at the centre of a major public health scare amid allegations he flouted infection - control measures at his @entity49 practice over a 32 - year period			1
so far more than 2,000 of his former patients have sought help and advice it has emerged mr @entity9 raked in around £ 1,000 a day treated a huge number of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle			1
he sold his @entity59 mansion on the outskirts of @entity61 for £ 1.5 million earlier this year and moved to a luxury @entity61 flat , pictured six months earlier inspectors had given mr @entity9 a clean bill of health			1
a spokesman for @entity14 said all 166 patients filmed being treated by mr @entity9 have been contacted			1
he said an alert was sent to gps and dentists in the area with guidance on how to advise patients who might contact them			2
that alert was sent to all @entity77 surgeries and dentists across the @entity78 , to ensure patients who have moved away from the @entity61 area can still seek help			1
he added : ' @entity11 and the @entity82 have been briefed , as have @entity11 choices who have placed information on their website			2
' other @entity11 organisations , including @entity88 and acute trusts , have been notified in order to direct patients to the correct place should they present with concerns			1
' detectives are also investigating whether the death of 23 - year - old patient @entity96 is linked to dental treatments she received			2
last week it emerged mr @entity9 could have earned up to £ 1,000 a day , fuelled by a huge turnaround of patients to fund an extravagant lifestyle			1
the 60 - year - old lived in a lavishly furnished @entity59 mansion and drove a range of sports cars , including a @entity106 , a @entity107 and a @entity108 , with personalised number plates			2
the impressive @entity59 mansion stands in seven - acres of grounds			2
it features seven bedrooms , three reception rooms and a study , garages for three cars , a tennis court , pond , wood , meadow and secret garden			0
it is built on land formerly owned by the @entity126 family , renowned landowners in @entity49			0
he sold the £ 1.5million grade two listed property , @entity131 , on the outskirts of @entity133 , @entity49 , earlier this year and moved to a luxury flat in an upmarket area of @entity61			1
a dedicated advice line has been set up offering guidance on how to access additional support			0
anyone who is concerned can call the advice line on 03330 142479 from 8am to 8pm , seven days a week			2
@entity14 has also set up a temporary @entity140 for patients , to provide further advice , counselling , and where necessary blood testing			2
patients can visit the clinic from 8am to 8pm seven days a week , at the @entity147 , located at @entity148 on @entity149 in @entity133 , @entity61			1
anyone who lives outside the area , or is housebound should contact the advice line for information about how to access screening			0
dentists are paid per patient , earning a minimum of £ 18.50 for a basic check - up and polish on the @entity11			1
health bosses revealed mr @entity9 saw 166 patients in a three - day period when he was filmed by a whistleblower in june			1
at an average of 55 patients a day , mr @entity9 would have earned a minimum of £ 1,017 a day and around £ 3,071 if all patients were paying the minimum fee			1
if 55 patients a day was an average for mr @entity9 , it means the 60 - year - old would have earned in excess of £ 371,000 a year , before tax			1
it is not known how many of mr @entity9 's patients had their treatment fully funded by the @entity11			1
but it is unlikely that over the course of the three - day period in june mr @entity9 only treated those patients charged the minimum fee			1
dentists charge @entity11 patients according to three bands - a band two appointment costs £ 50.50 and a band three , for the most complex procedures including dentures and bridges , costs £ 219			1
it is therefore likely that mr @entity9 's earnings were in excess of £ , 3,071 across the three days , and £ 371,000 a year			1
@entity191 are making enquiries into the death of @entity96 , 23 , a patient of mr @entity9 who died unexpectedly last year dr @entity194 , a medical director for @entity14 in @entity49 , said : ' he saw 166 patients in a three - day period			1
' that is a lot of patients			2
the footage showed us there were serious lapses			0
' mr @entity9 , who studied at the @entity202 and qualified in 1977 , was suspended for just 18 months in august by the @entity203 , pending the start of the investigation			1
@entity11 dentists are paid according to three bands			2
band 1 : £ 18.50 covers an examination , diagnosis and advice			2
if necessary it will also cover x-rays , a scale and polish and planning for further treatment band 2 : £ 50.50 covers all treatment covered by band one , plus additional treatment including fillings , root canal and removing teeth			2
@entity224 : £ 219 covers all treatments covered in bands one and two , plus complex procedures including crowns , dentures and bridges miss @entity96 , 23 , visited her gp on august 18 , 2013 , suffering from palpitations , and was taken to @entity233 before being transferred to @entity234 , where she died on august 22 of viral acute myocarditis			0
now @entity49 coroner @entity236 , who was not made aware that she had visited mr @entity9 's surgery prior to her death , has asked police to investigate			1
miss @entity96 's death was attributed to natural causes and because she died in hospital no inquest was held			0
the coroner has to power to order an inquest if she feels there are any questions over her death			0
@entity14 has set aside £ 500,000 for a massive operation to recall the 22,000 patients he treated in a career spanning three decades			1
patients say their dentist 's fall from grace has sent shockwaves through their community			2
he was as a well - liked and popular man before he left his role at the surgery earlier this year			0
one former patient of mr @entity9 , @entity261 , told @entity27 he had only ever been impressed by his dentist of more than 20 years			1
mr @entity9 worked for 32 years at the @entity263 , pictured , in @entity264 , @entity61			1
@entity11 bosses stressed the practice is under new ownership inspectors from the @entity269 visited @entity270 on july 17			1
their inspection came a month after a whistleblower raised concerns with health bosses over alleged infection - control breaches			1
in august , a report into their findings , found the practice failing in three of the five areas assessed - cleanliness and infection control , safety , availability and suitability of equipment and assessing and monitoring the quality of service provision			1
the report highlighted a range of hygiene concerns			0
inspectors noted : ' we observed the staff toilet and the room next to the toilet were being used as store rooms for equipment			0
' this posed a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated			0
' this risk had not been identified by staff at the dental surgery and no action had been taken to minimise it			0
' we saw that mops and buckets for cleaning the practice were stored directly next to the staff toilet , in the same room , which again posed a risk of this cleaning equipment coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated			0
' the report noted the practice had an infection - control programme in place , and that it had been reviewed in february 2013			2
inspectors had visited the clinic just six months before , in november last year , and gave it a clean bill of health			0
he said : ' he is a brilliant dentist			0
professional , courteous and the same goes for the staff			0
' a very popular dentist as the large numbers involved prove			0
' the whole thing stinks			0
i hate to think what mr @entity9 is going through			1
' rumours of his suspension had spread through the community before this week 's report was released by the @entity203 , criticising his hygiene practices			0
@entity337 , 24 , a construction worker from @entity338 said : ' when my partner told me about it , i was speechless			0
i came straight down to the centre and registered to be tested			0
' i had three teeth out earlier this year and there were no problems but it makes you think			0
' it all makes me feel uneasy , worried and a little bit scared			0
i 've been going there all my life and if i 've got something in my blood and passed it on to my partner , she could have given it to my son when she was pregnant			0
' @entity354 , 27 , from @entity133 , said she was worried about the situation because she is eight months pregnant			0
she said : ' i 'm having to get my children to go and have blood tests because of this , and i 'm pregnant i should n't be having to worry about it			0
' i think it 's disgusting			0
it 's a small dentist so i know they kept files in the toilets , so it would n't surprise me if he kept equipment in there as well			0
' she said they had been given packs with advice in and now had to wait 14 days until they find out the results			0
her mother , @entity375 , 54 , also of @entity133 , said : ' it 's absolutely disgusting			0
to think that our whole family has been going to see him for so long and now we 're all having to get tested over this			0
