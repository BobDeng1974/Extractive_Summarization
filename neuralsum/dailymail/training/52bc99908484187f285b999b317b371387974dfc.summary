by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 09:00 est , 9 may 2012 picking out the heat against the blazing beams of a parent star is like picking out a single candle among 10,000 - but scientists have picked up infrared rays from a planet 40 light - years away			1
but human beings are unlikely to be moving to 55 cancri e - at 2,000 degrees centigrade , the surface of the planet is hot enough to liquefy steel			1
researchers at @entity15 and other institutions say the planet may lack reflective surfaces such as ice caps , instead absorbing most of the heat from its parent star — much as @entity23 ’s dark oceans trap heat from the sun. scientists on a planetary - heat - seeking mission have detected the first infrared light from a super-earth ¿ in this case , a planet some 40 light - years away from this data , scientists have now calculated 55 cancri e ¿ s radius ( twice that of @entity23 ¿ s ) and the duration of its orbit ( 18 hours , versus our leisurely 365 days ) using telescopes on the ground and in space , scientists examine light patterns from a star to determine the traits of any planets around it			1
periodic dips in starlight indicate that a planet has transited , or passed in front of , its star			2
from this data , scientists have now calculated 55 cancri e ’s radius ( twice that of @entity23 ’s ) and the duration of its orbit ( 18 hours , versus our leisurely 365 days )			1
while the stellar brilliance enables researchers to detect changes in starlight , it ’s much trickier to detect light of any wavelength — visible or infrared — from the planet itself ‘ this planet is so close to the star that it ’s very strongly irradiated , ’ says co-author @entity65 , a postdoc in @entity15 ’s @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
‘ it ’s like in the movie ‘ @entity73 , ’ where @entity74 orbits the gas giant @entity77 from @entity74 gives an idea of how big the star would look from 55 @entity80 e. ’ the group obtained observations from @entity84 ’s @entity83 , which monitors infrared radiation emitted by objects in the solar system and beyond			2
@entity65 and his colleagues trained the telescope on @entity90 , observing the star during a six - hour window during which the tiny exoplanet passed behind it — a phenomenon known as an occultation			2
@entity65 measured the starlight before and after the planet ’s occultation , discovering a minute dip when the star completely eclipsed the planet			0
to make sure the dip was n’t merely a fluke , the team obtained three more sets of data for the same orbital window , and analyzed all four datasets together			0
‘ when you stack all the data together , you see a beautiful dimming light that clearly shows the light from the planet that disappears , ’ says co-author @entity106 , principal investigator of the @entity108 telescope program			0
‘ this is the first time that we see light from a planet that is that small			2
’ ¿ it ¿ s like in the movie @entity73 , ¿ where @entity74 orbits the gas giant @entity77			0
seeing @entity77 from @entity74 gives an idea of how big the star would look from 55 @entity124 ' say the researchers from the planet ’s infrared light , the researchers precisely calculated its temperature — a scorching 2,360 degrees @entity129 , or 3,700 ° f. with such high temperatures , @entity65 posits that the planet is likely rather dark , having no reflective surfaces such as ice caps , and probably absorbs most of the heat given off by its star			1
the planet ’s temperature may also give researchers a clue about its atmosphere			0
55 cancri e orbits its star much like the moon circles @entity23 , always presenting the same face			1
@entity65 suspects that much of 55 cancri e ’s heat remains on the ‘ day side ’ of the planet , and that it would be difficult to circulate such high temperatures to the planet ’s dark side : in other words , it ’s unlikely that the super-hot planet harbors any strong winds			1
@entity155 , an associate professor of astrophysics at the @entity157 , says it ’s extremely difficult for any instrument — including the @entity108 telescope — to make a direct detection of an exoplanet			0
he sees the group ’s detection as ‘ a great example of really pushing an instrument to its limits			0
’ he adds that the planet ’s infrared light will help identify more characteristics from this particular super-earth			1
; super-earths are fascinating objects because they do n't have any analogs in the solar system , ’ @entity155 says			0
‘ we do n't have a clear idea how they formed or even what they ’re made of			0
it ’s a mystery that requires data beyond the planet ’s mass and radius to resolve			0

first time infrared light from planet this small has ever been detected
@entity190 is twice the size of ours
surface of 55 cancri e - 40 light years from @entity23 - is hot enough to melt steel
planet may lack reflective surfaces such as ice caps - and absorb all of star *'s* heat
