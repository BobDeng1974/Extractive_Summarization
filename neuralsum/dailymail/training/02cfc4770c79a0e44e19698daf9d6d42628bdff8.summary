a mysterious ' beam ' of static electricity has been caught on camera making a passer - by 's hair stand on end			1
in the clip , filmed outside @entity8 's headquarters in @entity9 , @entity5 is shown entering the field of electricity before his hair rises - silhouetted by a nearby street lamp			1
as the camera then pans towards the building , a large crack of static electricity is heard before the video cuts out			1
mr @entity5 and his friend , known only as @entity29 , were walking past the tech giant ’s office in @entity32 , when they said they felt a ‘ strong electric field ’ and decided to film the experience			2
in the clip , mr @entity5 passes his phone to @entity29 before saying : ‘ alright , so there ’s this static electricity beam , right next to the @entity8 building in @entity9			1
‘ i ’m going to go inside the beam , and my hair is going to go up			0
’ at which point he explains that he can feel the electricity on his forehead , and describes it as ‘ super strong , like a beam of static electricity			2
’ although the shot is dark , mr @entity5 ’s hair can be seen rising in front of a nearby street light			1
the strange field was first discovered by a @entity54 user earlier this year			0
this led to theories that there was a problem with wiring beneath the building ( pictured ) , or that electricity was being generated by the building 's metal poles rubbing together			1
@entity64 has contacted @entity8 for a comment static electricity occurs when there is an imbalance between the positive and negative charges in an object			2
these charges can build up on the surface of an object , until they find a way to be released or discharged			0
when certain materials rub against each other , it can transfer electrons and create this charge - although it is not known what caused the electrical build - up to occur around the @entity8 building			1
@entity64 has contacted @entity8 for a comment			2
as the camera pans towards the building , a crackle of static electricity is heard and @entity29 shouts : ‘ @entity88 , can you hear that ? ’ , before the video cuts out			1
‘ initially it did n't hurts us , just surprised us , ’ mr @entity5 wrote online			0
‘ then it seemed to intensify and my phone started crackling and the video cut			0
' my friend got a strong electric shock from holding my phone up high			0

the strange field was first discovered by @entity54 user master_poop earlier this year			0
he wrote that that since experiencing the phenomenon , he had suffered from toothache and nosebleeds			0
this led to theories that there was a problem with wiring buried beneath the spot at which the field had been felt , but @entity128 investigated the issue and announced the area was safe			2
it is also thought that the design of the building , and its network of metal poles that rub together , could be generating the static field .			1

@entity138 was filmed outside @entity8 ’s @entity9 offices in @entity32
in the clip , @entity5 is shown standing in front of the building
as he enters the ' beam ' , hair is shown rising , silhouetted by a street lamp
as the camera pans towards the building , a crackle of static is heard
it is not known what caused the electrical build - up to occur
theories *include* a problem with wiring beneath the building , and electricity being generated as the building 's metal poles rub together
