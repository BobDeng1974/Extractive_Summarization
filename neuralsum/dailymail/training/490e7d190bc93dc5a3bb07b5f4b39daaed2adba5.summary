@entity0 decided to cut their losses on two of sir @entity4 's worst flops on deadline day as @entity6 and @entity7 were both pushed through the @entity9 exit door			1
@entity6 , who sealed a £ 25.7million move to @entity0 back in 2007 , was allowed to leave @entity12 's side on a free transfer in order to complete a move back to his native @entity16			1
@entity17 was also allowed to return to familiar surroundings as he rejoined @entity19 for a fee around £ 6m			2
@entity0 midfielder @entity6 has left @entity9 after spending eight years at the club @entity6 , pictured with @entity22 , has joined @entity16 outfit @entity23 @entity7 completed a deadline - day switch back to @entity19 after failing to make the grade at @entity9 @entity17 sealed a permanent switch back to @entity27 by signing a five - and - a - half year deal to rejoin the @entity19 the 22 - year - old will go down in history as @entity4 's last signing at the @entity32 but he did not have the chance of working under the @entity34 before the former manager 's retirement in 2013			1
here , @entity37 provides a countdown of @entity4 's worst 10 signings during his outstanding 26 - year reign at @entity0			1
10 - @entity41 ( £ 7million ) january 2009 - june 2010 appearances : 4 goals : 0 @entity4 decided to fork out £ 7m on @entity44 winger @entity41 in january 2009 as he went in search of a long - term replacement for @entity47			0
the former @entity0 manager claimed he had been monitoring @entity41 for a number of years but the player , now 27 , failed to live up to expectations at @entity9			2
@entity41 was shipped out on loan to @entity53 before eventually completing a move to @entity55 for an undisclosed fee			0
former @entity0 winger @entity41 did not score a goal during his time at the club 9 - @entity61 ( £ 3m ) july 2003 - may 2006 appearances : 40 goals : 8 @entity61 was billed as the ' next @entity64 ' when he arrived at @entity9 as a 20 - year - old striker			1
@entity0 beat off fierce competition to sign the @entity67 from @entity68 back in july 2003 on a @entity69 before eventually having to pay £ 3m in compensation			2
however , @entity61 joined @entity71 after struggling to cope with the demands of life at @entity9			0
@entity61 scored just eight goals in 40 appearances at @entity0 8 - @entity76 ( £ 28.1m ) july 2001 - august 2003 appearances : 82 goals : 11 @entity76 failed to establish himself in @entity80 football after moving to @entity0 for just shy of £ 30m			2
@entity4 said @entity76 ' was a world - class footballer ' who would bring ' a personality to the team ' , however , the big - money signing disrupted the balance of @entity0 's midfield			1
the former @entity87 and @entity88 playmaker , who was sold to @entity89 in 2003 , was unable to form a successful partnership with then @entity0 stars @entity91 and @entity93			0
@entity76 ( centre ) failed to form a successful midfield partnership with @entity91 ( right ) 7 - @entity96 ( £ 6.5m ) august 2003 - august 2005 appearances : 30 goals : 2 @entity16 @entity99 winner @entity96 was unveiled as a @entity0 player on the same day as @entity101			2
the central midfielder was seen as the big - name signing along alongside the relatively unknown @entity101 - but we all know which player proved to be the better purchase			0
@entity96 was signed to replace @entity76 , but he proved to be just as bad			0
@entity96 joined @entity0 for £ 6.5m on the same day as a certain @entity101 6 - @entity7 ( £ 15m ) - january 2013 - february 2015 appearances : 4 goals : 0 @entity17 was afforded just 28 minutes of @entity110 football to show he was worthy of rubbing shoulders with the likes of @entity114 , @entity22 and co. the @entity116 international failed to impress both @entity118 and @entity119 during his brief stint at @entity0			1
@entity4 's last signing will be hoping to prove the doubters wrong at former club @entity19 after sealing a permanent move back to @entity125			1
@entity17 has returned to @entity19 after failing to hold down a regular spot at @entity9 5 - @entity127 ( £ 170,000 ) - november 1988 - june 1991 appearances : 23 goals : 2 @entity4 plucked @entity127 from @entity130 for a mere £ 170,000 but has openly stated that the @entity132 midfielder was one of his worst buys			1
speaking in november 2009 , @entity4 said : ' i only paid £ 170,000 but still get condemned for it			0
' @entity127 was unable to find another professional club after leaving @entity0 on a permanent basis			0
@entity4 brought fellow countryman @entity127 to @entity9 for £ 170,000 in november 1988 4 - @entity138 ( £ 3.5m ) - july 2003 - january 2005 appearances : 39 goals : 2 ' he 's so good they named him twice , ' was the phrase which was circling around @entity0 's messageboards when @entity4 signed the defensive midfielder from @entity146			1
@entity138 was seen as a potential long - term replacement for @entity91 but he spent the majority of his @entity9 career on the bench			0
the fact that @entity138 is now playing for @entity152 in @entity153 tells you all you need to know about his failure to establish himself in @entity157			0
@entity138 , pictured with @entity64 , is among @entity4 's worst purchases 3 - @entity159 ( £ 4.5m ) - august 1999 - july 2000 appearances : 4 @entity4 's biggest failure in the transfer market was being unable to find a suitable replacement for @entity164			1
@entity159 was by far the worst he signed in an attempt to fill the gigantic void following the @entity168 's departure			0
he is remembered for his appalling error against @entity170 in september 1999 and for conceding five goals against @entity89 in his final appearance for the @entity32			0
@entity173 goalkeeper @entity159 made several high - profile blunders during his brief stint at the @entity32 2 - @entity6 ( £ 26m ) - july 2007 - february 2015 appearances : 179 goals : 9 @entity4 launched a £ 26m move for @entity6 after his brother @entity179 said he was ' better than @entity114 '			1
the @entity16 's potential was clear to see with the midfielder putting in fine performances against the likes of @entity184 and @entity185 during the early stages of his @entity0 career			0
however @entity6 , who was billed as the next @entity93 , struggled with fitness during his time in @entity190 and has now returned to @entity16 after his contract was cancelled			0
@entity6 ( right ) struggled for form and fitness during his eight - year spell at @entity0 1 - @entity195 ( £ 7m ) - august 2010 - july 2014 appearances : 7 goals : 1 @entity4 reportedly beat off competition from @entity200 giants @entity199 to sign @entity195 - the first player he signed without watching extensive video footage of			1
a @entity0 scout was ' adamant ' that @entity4 had to move quickly to conclude a deal for the @entity204 forward due to @entity199 's interest			2
@entity195 recently said ' i thought @entity0 were joking ' when they made a move for him in august 2010 , which shows just how bizarre his transfer to the @entity9 proved to be			1
