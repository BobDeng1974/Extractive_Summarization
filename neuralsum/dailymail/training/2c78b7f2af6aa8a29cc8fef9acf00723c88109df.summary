despite having never canoed before , an adventurous student travelled a gruelling 3,000 miles across @entity1 with a friend in a two - man boat			1
@entity4 , 21 , and friend @entity5 , 22 , completed their epic 21 - week journey from @entity8 in @entity9 to @entity10 in @entity11			1
they believe they may be the first to ever cross @entity1 purely by water , travelling through ten countries in their £ 1,500 two - man canoe			1
conquering by canoe : two students have travelled almost 3,000 miles across @entity1 in their two - man canoe , passing landmarks such as the parliament building on the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 mr @entity4 , a law graduate from @entity26 , said : ‘ we did n't do much training			1
i had never been in a canoe until two weeks before the trip and had never camped until our first night			1
‘ it was such a long trip but a great experience			2
i really enjoyed it and i missed it straight away when we got back			2
the @entity33 graduates travelled a total of 2,954 miles in 146 gruelling days which included a run in with @entity38 police and travelling across a military firing range			2
intrepid travellers : ( right to left ) @entity5 and @entity4 , who had never canoed before , believe they could be the first to ever cross @entity1 purely by water in their gruelling 21 - week trip tough challenge : mr @entity5 ( pictured in front of a vineyard on the @entity46 in @entity47 ) said there was no easy passage across @entity1 and had to take many detours and routes to reach their destination mr @entity4 said : ‘ it was challenging every day and my favourite part was that we did such a variety of things and met a lot of funny and helpful people who helped us with directions			1
‘ we managed to stay friends throughout which surprised a lot of people			0
‘ i loved the @entity65 but my favourite country was @entity9 as the food was so good			1
i did not like @entity68 - the whole experience there just gave me a bad experience of the place			0
‘ i start a job in @entity73 soon so i do n't think we will be doing another trip unfortunately			0
’ serene seas : the young men canoed through the @entity77 in @entity68 at sunrise adventure of a lifetime : mr @entity4 had hardly done any canoeing before their trip and had never camped before which saw them travelling through the @entity86 in @entity9 ( pictured ) in @entity38 the pair accidentally walked across a naval firing range			1
mr @entity4 said : ‘ it is probably the funniest story of the trip but quite scary			1
‘ we went out to test the water to see if it was too stormy to paddle			2
it was bad and dangerous so we stopped and pulled over to get out the boat			0
‘ unfortunately we got out and walked across a military firing range			0
we got into a lot of trouble for that and had to get a local to bail us out			0
’ plenty of stories : the students accidentally walked across a military firing range in @entity38 where police caught up with them ( right mr @entity4 pictured ) and through many places where most travellers would not normally go such as entering a lock on the @entity110 in @entity9 ( left ) tricky navigating : the students met many interesting people along the way who gave them directions when their trusty map failed them ( pictured mr @entity5 on the @entity23 in @entity116 ) the young men travelled through @entity9 , @entity47 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity25 , @entity120 , @entity116 , @entity68 , @entity38 and @entity11			1
mr @entity5 , a philosophy graduate from @entity121 , said : ‘ i thought it would be an interesting challenge			0
it was incredibly tough but we loved it			0
‘ neither of us had much canoeing experience although i did a trip in @entity130 in 2010			0
‘ with few connecting rivers there is no easy passage across @entity1 by canoe so it made it a real challenge			1
we had to go out of direction so many times to stay on the water			2
the route we undertook is a network of rivers and canals with hundreds of miles to battle upstream as well as challenging coastlines and industrial locks to overcome			0
‘ i enjoyed it and would do it again			0
there are so many funny memories			0
’ the duo secured sponsorship from the @entity152 at @entity33 to pay for their trip , which cost more than £ 6,000			2
would do it again : despite the challenges , mr @entity5 said he would do the epic trip again if he could best buddies : mr @entity4 ( left having some lunch in @entity25 ) said he missed the adventure as soon as he returned home to @entity26 and the pair ( right en route ) managed to stay friends throughout their adventure he said intrepid travel : the duo set up camp along the way during their 146 - day trip such as this campsite on the @entity65 in @entity116			1

@entity174 , 22 , and @entity4 , 21 , canoed for 21 weeks
they travelled through 10 @entity1 countries from @entity9 to @entity10
