by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 18:28 est , 17 october 2013 eight areas to receive a fuel duty cut are @entity4 constituencies but treasury secretary @entity5 dismissed any claims of favouritism drivers living in remote or rural areas are to receive a 5p a litre discount on their petrol			1
three communities in @entity14 and seven in @entity16 have been judged to meet strict criteria to qualify , the government will announce today			0
they will receive the fuel discount already introduced in the remote @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity20			1
the move has still to be approved by the @entity25 but treasury chief secretary @entity5 told the @entity26 there was an overwhelming case for a cut in duty in far - flung areas of the country that have high prices at the pumps			1
critics pointed out , however , that eight of the ten areas to benefit are in constituencies with @entity4 mps – two of them in mr @entity5 ’s own seat			1
four are in the constituency of former @entity4 leader @entity43 and one in @entity46 foreign secretary @entity45 ’s seat			0
@entity47 suggested it showed the chief secretary was willing to cut the cost of living only in ‘ his own back yard ’			1
but mr @entity5 dismissed any claims of favouritism , insisting the areas qualify because they are similar to the islands eligible for the existing discount			1
‘ it ’s something that for people in these communities will make a real difference , ’ mr @entity5 said			1
‘ the @entity26 has rightly highlighted the fact that fuel costs matter to everybody , but particularly to those in rural communities where a car is a necessity not a luxury			0
’ the fuel discount can be introduced only if the government can persuade the @entity25 that it would not breach @entity72 competition laws			1
a decision is expected within six months			0
three communities in @entity14 and seven in @entity16 have met the strict criteria to qualify for the 5p fuel duty cut and will receive the same discount as the @entity79 and @entity22 @entity23 , and @entity20 four of the areas to benefit are in @entity43 's ( left ) constituency and one in @entity45 ’s ( right ) seat precedents have been set by @entity84 and the @entity86 and @entity87 islands , which already enjoy fuel tax discounts approved by @entity89			1
if the extension is approved , it will bring the number of people in the @entity94 to benefit from the rural fuel scheme to nearly 120,000			0
the new areas to qualify include towns in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
they are at least 100 miles from a refinery and have sparse populations and high petrol prices			2
@entity105 , @entity47 spokesman on the economy , said : ‘ eight out of ten of these areas have @entity4 mps – including two in @entity5 ’s own constituency			2
‘ the public will want to be reassured this is no more than a coincidence because nobody will thank a @entity4 treasury minister who refuses to tackle the cost of living crisis everywhere but his own back yard			0
’ but mr @entity5 said : ‘ this has been a completely objective process			2
the list has been drawn up with pretty strict criteria			0
’ he also backed @entity125 ’s attempt to hold prices down for motorists across the country by keeping fuel duty frozen until the 2015 election			2
it means that by then petrol will be 20p a litre cheaper than it would have been under the previous @entity47 government ’s plans			0
average petrol prices in the @entity94 fell 5.49p a litre to 132.16p between mid-september and mid-october , said the @entity138			2
but it warned that a further dip in prices soon is unlikely .			0
