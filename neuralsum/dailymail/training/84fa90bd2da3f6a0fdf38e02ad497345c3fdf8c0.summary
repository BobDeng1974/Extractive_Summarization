forty - six @entity2 lottery winners from july 2013 to july 2014 used @entity4 numbers of dead people to collect their winnings , the state auditor said			1
an audit released wednesday said the use of dead people 's identification numbers creates a risk of reduced tax revenue for the state , overpayment of public assistance and lost collections on child support , defaulted student loans and other debt			2
auditor @entity20 said that up to $ 890,000 in prize winnings could have been recovered if winners below $ 250,000 were checked for debts against the @entity25 's set - off of @entity27 system			1
an audit said people used dead people 's identification numbers to avoid having winnings garnished or paying taxes the lottery now only checks winners of more than $ 250,000 in the soil system , but the audit recommends checks for all winners over $ 600			1
executive director @entity38 said during the @entity40 's monthly meeting thursday that they are aware people try to cheat the system and are working to tighten their regulations			0
' what we are working on is trying to find or get authorization to go even further to verify the legitimacy of social security numbers , something we are currently not authorized to do , ' @entity38 said , referring to federal law that she says prevents the lottery from performing automated @entity4 matches for all state departments			2
according to the commission , 26 winners were flagged as owing money after their @entity4 numbers came up in various state agency databases in january			1
twenty - three of them had their winnings garnished for things like public assistance , food stamps and student loans			0
the lotto failed to examine winners taking in less than $ 250,000 or check @entity4 numbers on claim forms ' that 's a problem with all industries with people using illegal @entity4 ( numbers )			1
in fact , we are ahead of the curve , ' said @entity40 chairman @entity76			0
' we 've been working to try to get that corrected , it 's just a matter of getting the regulators to give us the authority to go further			0
' @entity38 said in her written response to the audit that the lottery has to balance providing good service and timely payments with its legal responsibilities			0
she said that the lottery collected nearly $ 300,000 from winners that owed the state			0
@entity91 notes that lottery fraud is often a sign of ticket discounting , meaning the winning ticket has been resold			1
@entity38 , executive director of the @entity97 found nearly $ 900,000 in winnings had been claimed by the deceased according to an audit if a winner wishes to avoid the scrutiny that would lead to garnishing , they can might sell the ticket to a third party for less than the prize value , a practice that is illegal			1
the third party is often a lottery retailer who will give the seller quick cash			0
the third party will then claim the prize under their names , or often that of a relative , which is how the deceased winners may have been entered			2
@entity20 added that the lottery was n't verifying social security numbers on the claim forms .			0

frauds got through as lotto officials failed to check @entity4 numbers or scrutinize winners under $ 250,000
fraud points to tickets discounting , the *prohibited* practice of selling a winning ticket to a third party to avoid scrutiny
the third party may use a relative 's name and @entity4 numbers to avoid paying taxes themselves , *potentially* resulting in the name 's of the deceased being entered
