@entity0 powered in one of the most important headed goals in history on saturday night - the @entity4 central defender storming from deep to force extra time in the @entity7 final they eventually won			1
its timing - the third minute of added time in a game @entity4 looked destined to lose - was poetic and added to the occasion 's drama			1
here , @entity13 celebrates some of the best headers ever			2
have that ! @entity0 got @entity4 back in the game against @entity17 in the @entity7 final @entity18 ( @entity19 ) there was n't much @entity18 could n't do for @entity22 ' side last season , and he even managed to score a ridiculous header from the edge of the box against @entity27 in october			1
the @entity28 got on the end of a shallow cross , yanked his neck and thundered the ball past @entity33			0
bullet : @entity19 's @entity18 scored a sensational header against @entity27 in october 2013 @entity36 ( @entity37 ) similarly to @entity0 ' strike on saturday , @entity36 etched his name into @entity41 folklore by equalising for @entity37 in the 88th minute of their @entity7 final against @entity44 in 2012			1
a real striker 's goal at the near post			2
they 're back in it ! @entity36 netted an 88th minute equaliser against @entity44 in the 2012 @entity7 final and went on to score the winning penalty for the @entity53 @entity54 ( @entity55 ) only @entity56 can lay claim to being up there with @entity54 in a @entity55 shirt , with the ex-celtic and @entity62 man one of the most lethal forwards in world football in his day			1
one of @entity54 's best came in the 5 - 0 mauling of @entity66 at @entity67			1
he latched on to an @entity69 cross with a full - length dive to divert past the goalkeeper			0
no chance : @entity54 netted twice against @entity66 during @entity55 's 5 - 0 mauling at @entity67 @entity74 ( @entity19 ) the @entity76 end at @entity77 on @entity41 nights is a strange place ; it seems to suck some of the most breathtaking goals to grace the stadium , with @entity74 's effort against @entity83 in 2005 no different			1
running from deep , the @entity84 simply spun his neck to whip a header beyond a helpless @entity87			0
the @entity88 went on to comfortably beat the @entity89 3 - 0			0
from deep : @entity74 found the net with a header from the edge of the box against @entity83 in 2005 @entity95 ( @entity96 ) added time of a game @entity98 @entity96 really needed to win in 2001 , and substitute @entity95 came from absolutely nowhere to bullet a late , late winner in from @entity101 's desperate centre			2
incidentally , a certain @entity102 was the referee that night and the @entity103 won promotion via the play - offs			0
@entity106 ( @entity107 ) although in the eyes of some @entity111 football fans his career was tainted by a difficult spell at @entity113 , @entity106 was one of the more inventive finishers in world football			0
the @entity117 's crowning moment was perhaps a cute header against @entity119 at the 2002 @entity120			0
improvise : @entity106 scored a sumptuous header against @entity119 at the 2002 @entity120 for @entity107 @entity123 ( @entity124 ) there looked very little on when a floated cross found its way towards the @entity129 area , but @entity123 had other ideas			1
the big @entity131 got in between two defenders and used all of his neck power to drill a header home			0
@entity138 ( @entity139 ) this may be one of the only things @entity138 is remembered for , but it 's not a bad one			2
an @entity146 final goal , and a diving header at that			0
he notched a second equaliser against @entity151 on the day in 1987 at @entity152 , with the @entity139 going on to win 3 - 2			0
@entity153 ( @entity154 ) the winner in a cup final is n't half bad , but when it 's a diving header in the competition 's centenary year against @entity159 it 's bloody brilliant			1
@entity153 took flight on the edge of the box with the execution spectacular			2
@entity164 ( @entity165 ) a real improvised effort away at @entity167 , @entity164 twisted and turned in the six - yard box to give himself enough purchase to lever into the net			0
iconic : @entity139 's @entity138 ( left ) heads in the equalising second goal past @entity173 @entity175 man : @entity153 ( left ) scored a stunning winner for @entity154 in the 1972 fa cup final against @entity159 flicking ' eck ! @entity164 's effort against @entity167 in october 2010 was right out of the top drawer			1

@entity0 equaliser set up @entity4 for @entity41 title against @entity17
@entity54 , @entity123 and @entity18 have all scored super headers
@entity138 and @entity153 's fa cup strikes were so important
