by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 06:46 est , 27 july 2013 freedom : @entity3 mp @entity2 says adults should be allowed to enjoy legal porn adults should be free to enjoy ‘ legal ’ pornography without lecturing from the government , a minister close to @entity10 has declared			1
rising star @entity2 said the @entity11 should not sound disapproving about ‘ consenting ’ adults privately enjoying online sex			1
the planning minister , however , acknowledged the ‘ appalling ’ online dangers for children			2
he is a close ally of the prime minister , who just days ago promised to legislate to enforce ‘ opt - in ’ filters to block pornography on the internet			2
but mr @entity2 took a more libertarian stance , writing in his local newspaper , the @entity23 : ‘ as a conservative , my starting point is that people should be free to live their lives as they choose			1
‘ i am not going to start lecturing consenting adults about their private enjoyment of legal pornography			1
’ mr @entity2 said the internet had ‘ expanded the horizons of young people to an almost unimaginable degree ’			1
however , it had also exposed them to ‘ appalling risks and horrors ’			0
he added : ‘ both intentionally and by mistake , children can be exposed to pornographic images at an age when they are much too young to understand what sex can involve			2
‘ they can stumble upon situations in which the vile degradation of women – because it usually is women – is made to seem normal			0
harmful : pornography depicting rape will be outlawed and automatic blocking will come into force ‘ worst of all , through the false intimacy of the internet , they can sometimes be persuaded to exchange images of themselves by child pornographers and paedophiles			2
’ mr @entity2 said the prime minister was right to exert pressure on internet service providers to put an automatic block on pornography			1
this means that adults will have to ‘ opt - in ’ if they want to be able to access sexually explicit websites			2
‘ childhood is fleeting , ’ added the minister			0
‘ the world ’s dangers have to be confronted soon enough			0
‘ parents need government to make it easier for them to protect their children until they are ready to venture forth into the world			0
’ in a victory for the @entity76 , mr @entity10 has vowed to shield youngsters from ‘ poisonous ’ websites which corroded their childhood			1
clampdown : prime minister @entity10 announced strict measures for porn this week pornography depicting rape will also be outlawed as part of a government crackdown on web filth			1
by the end of 2014 , all 19million @entity87 homes currently online will be contacted by service providers and told they must say if family - friendly filters blocking all porn sites should be switched on or off			1
all new customers will have porn automatically blocked by the end of the year , unless they ask for the filter to be removed			2
mr @entity10 said he did not want to ‘ moralise or scaremonger ’ but felt that as a politician ‘ and as a father , that the time for action has come ’			1
@entity101 said it recently donated £ 3.3million to help track child abuse imagery and has ‘ zero tolerance ’ of indecent pictures of children			0
@entity106 has officially backed a new law forcing service providers to filter out filth			0
but left - wingers and even libertarians within conservative circles have said the plan impinges on personal freedom			0
other critics warned that paedophiles and tech - savvy youngsters will find ways round the filters			0
but campaigners said the scale and nature of porn flowing into homes is unprecedented and that it normalises violence			0
there are also fears that the acts witnessed by children warp their view of relationships .			0

@entity2 said @entity10 is right to demand an automatic block on porn
but he thinks adults should be free to enjoy ' legal ' online sex
