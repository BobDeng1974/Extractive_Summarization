by @entity0 @entity2 whistleblower @entity1 has hit back at claims made by the @entity5 administration that he was merely a low - level hacker and has claimed that he worked undercover for both the @entity7 and the @entity2			1
‘ i was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word , in that i lived and worked undercover overseas - pretending to work in a job that i 'm not - and even being assigned a name that was not mine , ’ he told @entity13 in his first interview with a @entity16 tv network			1
@entity1 , who was granted temporary asylum in @entity22 after revealing details of @entity16 spying activities to journalists , portrayed himself as ‘ a technical specialist ... a technical expert			2
i do n't recruit agents			0
what i do is i put systems to work for the @entity16			2
and i 've done that at all levels from - from the bottom on the ground all the way to the top , ’ he told @entity13 ’s @entity35			1
last year , when @entity1 began leaking details of @entity2 spying programs and left the country , administration officials played down his work history , using descriptions such as ' systems administrator ' to describe his role at the agency			2
in june , president @entity5 told reporters : ' no , i ’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29 - year - old hacker			0
' @entity1 told @entity35 that those terms were ' misleading			1
' @entity1 told @entity13 's @entity35 that he had been trained as a spy and had worked undercover for both the @entity7 and the @entity2 in the @entity61 job , @entity1 said , he ' developed sources and methods for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world			1
' ' so when they say i ’m a low - level systems administrator , that i do n’t know what i ’m talking about , i ’d say it ’s somewhat misleading , ' he said			2
after leaving the government , @entity1 continued his intelligence work for the @entity2 as a private contractor , including stints in @entity78 and @entity79			2
while in the @entity79 he downloaded an estimated 1.7 million files before fleeing first to @entity81 and then to @entity30			0
he has been charged with espionage and had his @entity16 passport revoked			0
back in the limelight : @entity2 whistleblower @entity1 will appear in his first interview with mainstream @entity86 this week @entity87 was interviewed in @entity30 last week			1
an hour - long special will air on wednesday at 10 p.m. et. the exclusive interview is the latest media appearance by @entity1 , following a videolink speech at the @entity92 , a @entity93 in march and an interview in @entity96 's may issue			1
also appearing on the @entity13 special is @entity98 , the @entity99 winning journalist who broke the @entity2 surveillance story in the @entity101			0
@entity1 ’s interview comes after the @entity103 moved the @entity16 closer to ending the @entity2 's bulk collection of @entity16 ' phone records last thursday			1
it is the most significant demonstration to date of @entity1 's impact on the debate over privacy versus security			0
but the final version of the legislation , ‘ watered down ’ in the words of one supporter , also showed the limits of that impact			0
interview : @entity118 anchor @entity35 travelled to @entity30 , @entity22 , where mr @entity1 holds temporary asylum since last year , and spent several hours quizzing him exclusive : the hour long interview is set to air on wednesday night , and may give a further insight into @entity1 's future plans the bill was severely weakened to mollify @entity16 intelligence agencies , which insisted that the surveillance programs that shocked many @entity16 are a critical bulwark against terror plots			1
the bill was approved 303 - 121 , which means that most @entity103 members can now say they voted to end what many critics consider the most troubling practice @entity1 disclosed — the collection and storage of @entity16 calling data by the secretive intelligence agency			1
but almost no other major provision designed to restrict @entity2 surveillance , including limits on the secret court that grants warrants to search the data , survived the negotiations to get the bill to the @entity103 floor			0
and even the prohibition on bulk collection of @entity16 ' communications records has been called into question by some activists who say a last - minute change in wording diminished what was sold as a ban			2
‘ people will say , “ we did something , and is n't something enough ” , ‘ said @entity159 , who tracks intelligence issues for the @entity161			0
‘ but this bill does n't fundamentally resolve the uncertainties that generated the whole controversy			0
’ though some privacy activists continued to back the bill , others withdrew support , as did technology companies such as @entity170 and @entity171 .			0

in his first ever interview with a @entity16 tv network , the @entity29 said many of the terms used to describe him were ' misleading '
@entity1 said , he ' developed sources and methods for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile environments '
a one - hour interview with @entity13 will air on wednesday night
