by @entity1 reporter the use of colour in photography was a readily available - albeit expensive - practice in @entity6 and the @entity7 by the 1890s , but it was n't until 30 years later that the method really caught on in @entity10			1
now a new exhibition at the @entity12 in @entity13 explores the emergence and development of colour photography in the country in the years before and after the @entity18			1
the @entity20 exhibition - which takes its name for the @entity23 word for ' first colour ' - shows how the earliest efforts to move away from black and white images came in the form of ' hand colouring ' techniques , which saw water - colours , paints or dyes manually added to the monochrome images			1
the next development was invented by photographer @entity35 , who exposed black and white printing plates through red , green and blue filters three times in quick succession			2
this technique produced misty but atmospheric images that looked almost as if they were paintings			0
the method caught on and was widely used until the mid- 1960s , when a cheap colour film was finally made available to the public - 10 years after the government created a version that was restricted for state use only			0
even this film sparked photographs seemingly unique to @entity10 , as it was mass produced in the form of reversal film designed to be used in projectors , rather than creating negatives or prints			2
incredible : this 1953 photograph of @entity58 's funeral was taken by @entity59 in @entity60			0
surrounded by a sea of brightly - coloured flowers and a near - forest of palms , @entity59 ' clever use of colour and light gives the brutal dictator 's final public appearance a suitably atmospheric feel impression : this image - another by the photojournalist @entity59 - is titled ' rain ' and shows @entity60 commuters waiting at a bus stop during a heavy downpour in the mid- 1960s			0
the image - with open umbrellas taking on the appearance of lilies , the shimmering street looking like water and the overall soft pastel colouring - looks almost like a painting by @entity86 human spirit : although these photographs were taken more than 50 years apart , the vivid use of colour makes them appear contemporaneous			0
in @entity93 's ' portrait of girl in @entity10 costume ' ( left ) - which was taken in @entity96 in the 1900s - colour is introduced manually by applying paint or dye to a monochrome image			2
meanwhile in @entity101 's ' student ' ( right ) colour reversal film of the sort normally meant for a projector is used technique : @entity106 's photograph of young sea cadets at the end of the 1940s is a colour image made using @entity112 's innovative method of exposing black and white printing plates through red , green and blue filters three times in quick succession design : both @entity118 ' 1911 image ' first year of the military service ' ( left ) and @entity121 's 1932 photomontage ' @entity122 ! ' appear in the @entity20 exhibition , which takes its name for the @entity23 word for ' first colour '			1
the project explores the emergence and development of colour photography since the late 19th century @entity131 is the colour : work by the photojournalist @entity59 - such as this atmospheric untitled image of a @entity136 flag in the 1960s - makes up a large part of the @entity12 exhibition			1
@entity140 - born @entity139 graduated from @entity141 to become a maths teacher in a @entity143 , but fell in love with photography and began a career in photojournalism in 1939			0

new exhibition at @entity12 in @entity13 explores development of colour photography in @entity10
*stunning* images show the way @entity23 photographers invented unique ways to introduce colour to their work
