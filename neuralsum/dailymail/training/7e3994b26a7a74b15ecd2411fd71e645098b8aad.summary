by @entity1 reporter published : 07:04 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 12 november 2013 criticism : @entity3 has landed in hot water for using @entity5 to promote her new book the sister of @entity9 founder @entity8 has landed in hot water for using @entity5 to promote her new book			1
@entity3 , 31 , who used to work at the social networking site , wrote on her @entity13 page : ' in honor of @entity5 , share how tech helped / complicated life while serving & get a free signed copy of my book ! but her attempt to use the special day as a form of promotion was met with disgust by many on monday morning			1
one user @ @entity26 tweeted : ' it 's called @entity5 / @entity28 , not " get my book day " , @ @entity30 , ' while @ dangillmor wrote : ' most tone - deaf book promotion ever ? ' she also posted the comment on @entity9 , where it received 250 likes			2
but one user @entity37 wrote : ' to use @entity5 to promote a book that has nothing to do with veterans is just disgusting			2
i 'm not jumping to any conclusions			0
it 's very clear to me what 's going on here			0
' but it appeared following a private discussion with @entity3 , he backtracked and wrote on the post : ' so ... i mentioned this to @entity3 privately , but i 'll say it publicly because i think it needs to be said			2
probably went a bit over the top in another thread ( not going to link to it because i 'm not exactly proud of it ) with a comment i 've made			0
tweet : @entity3 , 31 wrote on her @entity13 page : ' in honor of @entity5 , share how tech helped / complicated life while serving & get a free signed copy of my book ! ' ' apologies to @entity3 for making the comment - that - shall - never - be - spoken - of - again			1
also , excited to read her book and give it a review on ye olde blog			0
so , there 's that			0
kudos to @entity3 for the book and helping vets connect to their families through the use of technology			1
' it is not clear what was written in the post referred to or what exchange the pair had			0
last week @entity3 defended her decision to publish two children 's books encouraging people to stay away from social media - even if it does n't fit with her brother 's business plan			1
@entity3 , 31 , worked at @entity9 in its formative years , serving as marketing director for six years before leaving in 2011 to strike out on her own			2
she says her brother is ' supportive ' of her latest enterprises			2
meet dot : @entity3 , older sister of @entity9 founder @entity8 , has written a children 's book about a girl named @entity101 who needs to learn how to live without technology working together : ms @entity3 ( left ) worked at her little brother @entity104 ( right ) company in it 's early years , serving as the director of market development and spokesman for @entity9 since leaving @entity9 in 2011 she has formed @entity108 , a media and production company that so far has a failed @entity111 reality show under its belt , had a child and produced the two books based on her ruminations on lifestyle and technology			1
given @entity3 's familial relations and work history , it has been noted that it seems disingenuous to take critical stance on a culture that she herself helped create			2
in @entity101 , a picture book illustrated by @entity124 , a small girl named @entity101 who apparently spends all her time on social media - she ' knows how to tap			1
to share ' - has her @entity127 taken away from her by her mother			0
and in @entity129 , @entity3 covers how technology relates to etiquette , privacy , family and career , with tips and anecdotes interspersed			1
among other social media gaffes , @entity3 advises against oversharing , which she says ' can rob your partner of intimacy , as well as annoy your friends			1
' in an interview with @entity144 she said she saw how easy it was to be consumed by silicon valley			0
' it 's easy , in @entity111 , to become absorbed in what we 're building			0
it 's important to raise your head and see the big picture			0
if i had n't had a son , i 'd probably still be there working 90 hours a week on projects , and be happy there			0
' and writing her books she reveals how she relished the chance to turn off the technology			2
' gradually , over the course of a month , i loved being unreachable , ' she told the paper			0
' i saw that the world did n't end if i waited to respond to an e-mail in six hours , rather than six minutes			0
' as someone who has committed her fair share of social media faux pas , @entity3 feels she 's uniquely qualified to write about navigating technology			1
new book : @entity3 's guide to navigating our increasingly connected world ' personally , along with being part of the team that built @entity9 from early on , i also grew up on social media , ' she told @entity178			1
' if people can learn from my mistakes , or feel more of a sense of connection with what i ’m saying because i ’ve shown some vulnerability , then i think we ’re at a better starting point			0
' among other suggestions , @entity3 writes , in a sentiment many will agree with , ' just because you can document your every waking moment does n’t mean you should			2
' she told the @entity144 that she never intended to be a social media doyenne , but found that the same questions kept arising everywhere she went			1
' i did a lot of public speaking last year , and no matter where i went , people always asked the same questions : how can i better understand what my children are doing online ? how can i ask my significant other not to immediately reach for their tablet in bed ? how can i make sure i do n't lose my job to someone who is younger and more tech - savvy ? ' she gathered their business cards and launched a newsletter , @entity129 , to address those topics			0
many of those thoughts have been collected in the book , of which she says her family , including her brother @entity8 , approves			1
' my goal with this book is to spark dialogue and inspire people of all ages to embrace technology and the new sets of norms that come with sharing content online - something my family has always been supportive of , ' she told @entity178 .			1

@entity3 tweeted about getting a signed copy of her new book
