this mysterious ' @entity1 ' scrawl found on several @entity3 planes triggered security fears earlier this week and an investigation by the @entity6			1
but aviation and language experts today claim they were the work of a lone graffiti artist - and are not actually @entity1 at all			1
the special chemical paint appears towards the back of the 737 aircraft , but only after an auxiliary power unit on the plane is turned on - warming the underbelly , engines and landing gear			1
however the @entity31 at @entity32 in @entity33 looked at the photos for @entity35 and a spokesman concluded they are ‘ not arabic script ’			2
most of the affected planes appear to be flying out of @entity40 , @entity41			0
@entity3 said the markings are not seen as a threat , but began appearing on the bellies of its jets earlier this year			1
in a statement to @entity49 radio , @entity3 said it is working with authorities to uncover who was behind the ' vandalism ' , but added that currently it is not clear how many people are involved			1
‘ the markings have no affiliation to any known group or activity , ’ a @entity3 spokesman said			1
‘ the markings at this time are being considered vandalism			1
’ the markings have been appearing on the airline 's signature 737 jets for the past several months and vary in appearance , the spokesman said			2
they began to appear in february , reported @entity66			0
security fears : the markings have raised alarm about someone 's ability to get that close to an aircraft the @entity6 and other law enforcement agencies concluded the markings do not present a threat or a safety hazard and are vandalism - not terrorist - related , the spokesman added			1
officials did not say whether the markings are messages of any sort , or if they are words or simply scribbling			0
they do not know if they were made on purpose or were caused by a mechanical issue			0
@entity84 , operations and security editor of aerospace publisher @entity86 , told @entity35 he believes it was ‘ an inside job ’			0
‘ if it has been going on since february and there have been no ill effects it does n’t seem very dangerous , because if it ’s an insider with access to aircraft , why has he not done harm in the intervening seven months if that were his intent ? he ’s only made a few harmless daubs			0
’ he added graffiti artists are often motivated by spraying in places where they should not be allowed - and remain undetected			2
‘ railways and railway property have been popular worldwide - maybe they ’re now targeting airlines and airport property , ’ he said			0
@entity3 , which exclusively uses 737 aircraft in its routes , had determined that there was no danger to the planes or the passengers , the spokesman said			1
‘ we obviously take the behavior very seriously and we will continue to involve local and federal law enforcement as needed until the situation is resolved , ’ the spokesman added			0
several theories have been put forward as to the origin of the writing , including vandalism by an employee			0
@entity117 broke the story after being tipped off by a source			0
he said : ' it does raise disturbing questions about the security because anybody who has the ability to write on an airplane and can get that close to do it , also has the ability to do other things to that aircraft			2
' @entity131 - based television channel @entity130 had cited multiple sources as saying that the markings appear to be @entity1 words			1
but these pictures have since appeared on @entity66			0
the photos were sent to @entity66 by a @entity3 employee , who said the markings are usually seen on the exhaust pipe of engines and look like swords			1
he said he had not seen any ' @entity1 ' writing			2
security across the @entity144 has been tightened in recent weeks due to the 10th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on @entity147 and @entity33 see video here			0
