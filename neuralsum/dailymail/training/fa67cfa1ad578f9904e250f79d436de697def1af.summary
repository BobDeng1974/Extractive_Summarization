with his regiment weak with hunger and short of ammunition , @entity0 knew there was only one way to save himself and his fellow soldiers			1
in an extraordinary act of bravery , the bombardier crawled across @entity10 and into the @entity12 trenches in the dead of night to steal rations for his @entity16 comrades			1
a few weeks later , he lost an arm and a leg in a @entity12 attack , but despite his injuries , miraculously survived for four days in the freezing mud , before being rescued by @entity23 medics from the @entity24			1
hero : @entity0 who crawled into a @entity12 trench to steal food for his friends in @entity16			1
a few weeks later , he lost an arm and a leg in a @entity12 attack			1
he is pictured with his wife @entity32 the act epitomised the courage of mr @entity0 , his granddaughter @entity33 said , who never once complained about his war time experience or injuries			1
although he received three war medals , mr @entity0 ’ bravery was never formally recognised and she has decided to tell his story for the first time ahead of the 65th anniversary of his death next week			1
‘ he was an extraordinary man , ’ mrs @entity33 said			0
‘ a real character , but very self - effacing			0
‘ his comrades used to come to see him after the war and talk about what he did , but he was always of the attitude that he had been left with no choice , someone had to get a grip of the situation			2
‘ there ’s been a lot this year about the 100th anniversary of the @entity16 and honouring those who died , everyone is touched by their stories			0
stoic : @entity33 from @entity62 , @entity63 , says he never once complained about his war time experience or injuries			0
although he received three war medals , mr @entity0 ’ bravery was never formally recognised and she has decided to tell his story for the first time ahead of the 65th anniversary of his death ‘ but it also struck me that there were a lot of men who came back that suffered terribly and had to scrape together a living			1
my grandfather was one of those and i wanted to tell his story to coincide with the anniversary of his death next week			0
’ born in @entity81 , @entity63 , in 1881 , mr @entity0 was 34 , married and a father to seven children by the time he was called up with the @entity84 , in 1915			1
his fellow soldiers quickly nicknamed him ‘ @entity90 ’ , after the traditional fruit cake he was sent from home by his ‘ nanny ’ that he generously shared out in the trenches			0
but by february 1918 , as the war neared its end , food on the frontline were scarce and mr @entity0 ’ regiment were starved of rations			1
despite his injuries , mr @entity0 quickly re-adjusted to civilian life and started selling the @entity99 from a pitch outside the @entity102 hotel for 20 years ‘ his regiment were stuck for food and ammunition , ’ mrs @entity33 said			1
‘ he crawled all the way over to the @entity12 trenches to steal what they needed , and then crawled back			1
‘ he did it under the cover of darkness , he had to crawl quietly on his stomach , elbows and knees under lines and lines of barbed wire			0
he said he could hear the @entity12 talking but took what he could , stuffed it under his battle dress and crawled back			2
it must have taken a great deal of courage			0
’ a few weeks later , the regiment was situated close to the infamous @entity126 , which claimed so many @entity129 lives , when the @entity130 began			0
more than a million shells rained down on the @entity24 positions , in some of the heaviest @entity12 bombing of the war			2
describing the moment which would change her grandfather ’s life forever , mrs @entity33 said : ‘ he was holding two horses and a copy of @entity141			0
‘ the magazine had fallen to the floor , and he bent down to pick it up			0
as he did so a shell crashed down which blew up his horses and the two officers stood up right next to him - taking his left arm and lower leg with them			2
’ as he lay motionless amid the destruction , a @entity12 soldier tried to ‘ finish him off ’ by stabbing a bayonet in mr @entity0 ’ neck , she added			1
mrs @entity156 was sent a telegram to say her husband was presumed dead , but incredibly he survived			2
‘ four days later some young @entity23 medical volunteers were sent in to pick up the corpses , ’ mrs @entity33 , a retired @entity159 nurse , said			0
‘ miraculously , when they picked @entity0 up , they saw his eyes flickering			2
he must have been hypothermic , as the body can sometimes last much longer when it ’ s freezing cold			0
’ he was initially taken to an @entity23 field hospital because he was wearing an @entity23 uniform , having discarded his own after a mustard gas attack			0
what remained of his leg was amputated at the mid-thigh , and he was sent home to be rehabilitated at @entity173 , @entity63			0
despite his injuries , mr @entity0 quickly re-adjusted to civilian life and started selling the local newspaper , the @entity99 , from a pitch outside the famous @entity102 hotel for 20 years			1
mr @entity0 and his wife also had four more children , including mrs @entity33 ’s mother , @entity182 , and her twin in 1919			2
mr @entity0 wartime experience , however , never left him and he died aged 68 on december 9 1949 of lung problems caused by exposure to mustard gas .			2
