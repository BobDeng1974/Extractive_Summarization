this recent footage of humpbacks was take over two days using his remote control drone , the @entity52 phantom , with @entity0 seeing what the @entity17 is filming via a special pair of goggles			2
' the first day 's footage is featuring a mother and baby whale and then a mother baby and escort , ' he said			2
' the bond between mother and calf is very special and they are never far apart			0
' the escort can be male or female and not the father or relative but a passing whale that adopts a protective role and stays with a mother and baby to look out for them			0
' @entity0 captures a less serene sight in his second set of footage , a pod of fighting males in pursuit of a female humpback vying for the chance to mate			1
' this is called a ' heat run ' where a group of males chase down and fight for the dominant position behind a female for the opportunity to mate , ' @entity0 said			2
' these battles can rage on for hours eventually leaving the strongest male to mate			0
' the drone , fitted with a @entity17 camera , films a humpback as it begins to breach in the serene , warm waters off @entity7 @entity0 controls the drone from a boat driven by his wife @entity19 , and watches the footage of the @entity17 through a special set of goggles the stunning islands of @entity7 , part of @entity10 , where @entity0 moved from @entity42 in @entity43 five years ago to run a dive resort the drone gets up close and personal with the mother humpback , giving remarkable access to the veteran wildlife cameraman @entity0 and @entity19 also use the drone as an information gathering tool as they assist in the research into the whale population 's movement through their region			1
