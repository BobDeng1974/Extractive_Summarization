a cleric read the verdict before the truck came and dumped a large pile of stones near the municipal garden			2
@entity7 fighters brought in the woman , clad head to toe in black , and half buried her in the ground			2
then they told residents who had gathered around the scene to carry out the sentence : stoning to death for the alleged adulteress			2
none in the crowd stepped forward , said a witness to the event in a northern @entity23 city			1
so the jihadi fighters , mostly foreign extremists , did it themselves , pelting @entity26 with rocks			1

a day earlier , 26 - year - old @entity54 was killed in a similar way in the nearby town of @entity57 by @entity59 fighters			2
she was also accused of having sex outside marriage , the @entity60 reports			2
the killings are believed to be the first of their kind in rebel - held northern @entity23 , where is jihadis have seized large swaths of territory , terrorising residents with a strict interpretation of @entity73 law , including beheadings and cutting off the hands of thieves			1
the jihadis recently tied a 14 - year - old boy to a cross-like structure and left him for several hours in the scorching summer sun before bringing him down - punishment for not fasting during the @entity73 holy month of @entity83			2
this pictured posted by the @entity85 , a @entity23 opposition group , shows fighters from the @entity42 on parade in the city of @entity49			1
activists have reported two cases of stoning this month in that province the stonings in @entity23 last month were not widely publicised at the time , but in the following days three photographs appeared online which appeared to document the grisly spectacle			1
the circumstances of the photos were consistent with other @entity60 reporting			0
pictures posted on a newly - created @entity101 account showed dozens of people gathered in a square , a cleric reading a verdict through a loudspeaker and several bearded men with automatic rifles either carrying or collecting stones			0
' a married woman being stoned in the presence of some believers , ' read the caption of the photographs on the @entity101 account , which has since been suspended			0
@entity116 , the activist who witnessed @entity118 's stoning , told @entity60 that locals were angry to see foreign fighters impose their will on the community			1
' people were shocked and could n't understand what was going on			0
many were disturbed by the idea that @entity127 and @entity128 were issuing ( such ) orders , ' he said in an interview via @entity131			0
ms @entity26 , he said , appeared unconscious , and he had overheard that she was earlier taken to a hospital where she was given anaesthesia			0
the stoning took place after dark , he said , at about 11pm			0
he could not see blood on the body because of the black clothes she was wearing			0
ms @entity26 did not scream or shake			0
' they then took the dead body in one of their cars and left , ' he said			0
the first case of stoning occurred in the town of @entity57			0
a day after the july 17 , 2014 , stoning of @entity150 , 26 , @entity118 was stoned to death in the provincial capital of @entity49 the two cases were first reported by the @entity155 - based @entity154 , which collects information through a network of activists around the country			1
@entity160 , a spokesman for the @entity161 , a @entity23 group that tracks human rights violations , also confirmed the stoning			1
an activist based in the northern province of @entity166 , who collects information from other activists in northern @entity23 , said ms @entity26 was a widow			1
a man who asked to be identified as @entity171 , a pseudonym , for fear of repercussions , said that in the other stoning , in @entity57 , residents also refused to take part , and that the act was carried out by @entity42 members			1
the @entity181 @entity180 in @entity23 , in a statement posted on its @entity101 account , condemned the ' barbaric stoning ' of a woman in @entity57			1
international human rights groups did not report the stoning , and @entity188 said it had no independent confirmation			0
' it is a very worrying trend if true , ' said @entity188 researcher @entity191			0
the @entity42 group has ' imposed incredibly restrictive rules on the civilian population which have served to make women and girls particularly vulnerable and to quite clearly discriminate against them , ' she said , adding that the reports of the stoning were the first the group had received out of @entity23			1
' this is just a more sort of extreme manifestation of those restrictive rules which are all in violation of international ' human rights law , she said .			0

locals refused to take part in the barbaric executions in @entity49 , north @entity23
so mainly foreign fighters did it themselves , witnesses to the killings say
one *victim* seemed to be *anaesthetised* before the sentence was carried out
