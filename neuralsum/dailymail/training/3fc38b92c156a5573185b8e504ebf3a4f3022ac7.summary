amid all the thunder in @entity2 on friday night , @entity0 believe they can unleash a lightning bolt			1
@entity4 has been recalled to electrify the visitors ’ attack in midfield			1
the @entity9 centre will provide @entity11 ’s side with something different , of that there can be no doubt			1
alongside him , @entity15 of @entity16 will attempt to take on the @entity17 centres @entity18 and @entity19 at their own game of power - running and off - loading , but @entity4 is the x-factor addition			1
@entity4 is pictured by @entity24 ahead of @entity0 's @entity26 clash with @entity17 this friday @entity4 was all smiles when he spoke to @entity24 's @entity28 earlier this week the @entity9 centre will provide @entity11 's side with a real injection of pace on friday friday will see @entity0 ’s 11th centre combination since @entity11 took over the reins as head coach			1
@entity35 ’s favourite pair is @entity36 and @entity37 , who is the most frequently selected centre ( 19 )			2
his selection for a first @entity41 appearance since june 2013 is reward for consistently outstanding club performances this season			1
last month , the 23 - year - old demonstrated his match - winning credentials with a masterclass in @entity48 capped by a stunning act of sorcery to conjure a bonus - point try for his team			1
the slaloming break which followed a clever little kick into space was a vivid example of his ability to shred defences and it helped to propel him into @entity0 ’s starting xv , confirmed on thursday for their @entity26 opener at the @entity63			1
@entity11 will hope @entity4 offers an alternative to the route - one approach			1
@entity18 , @entity19 and @entity15 will set out to batter the defensive ramparts , while the man in the white @entity69 shirt will seek to circumvent them			0
@entity71 , the man charged with igniting the @entity73 attack from fly - half , knows all about the qualities offered by his back - in - favour @entity9 colleague and he offered an emphatic endorsement			1
‘ he ’s been brilliant , especially this year with his communication , ’ said @entity71			2
‘ in attack , he has been world - class and his defence has been brilliant as well ; he leads that at the club			1
@entity71 - speaking to the media on wednesday - has heaped praise on @entity9 team - mate @entity4 the fly - half is pictured in training for @entity0 during a session at @entity91 on wednesday five things to know about @entity0 centre @entity4 ' @entity4 always has that ability to create something out of nothing with an outside break or he off - loads with one hand — and like you saw against @entity48 , his little kick through to create that try			1
‘ there are n’t many players who can create things like that			0
he offers something different with his speed , his agility and his outside break			0
it is our job to get him into the right positions to do that			0
‘ he always wants the ball in his hands in attack , but he is also good at things people do n’t see , like his kick - chase and his communication about when to kick and so on			2
' to get the opportunity to play with him on friday is exciting			0
’ @entity71 played down the significance of @entity4 ’s tour de force in @entity48 , on the basis that he has been hitting such heights all season			1
‘ he was brilliant that day , ’ said @entity71 , ‘ but he has been playing like that all year			2
the try he created sticks out but he ’s been making line - breaks all year			1
' he has been defensively solid and making good hits all year , too			2
he has definitely earned his start on friday			0
’ @entity4 was reluctant to bang his own drum , but admitted that the performance in @entity48 ‘ probably helped ’ his claims for a @entity41 return			1
he has been more satisfied with his improvements in less eye - catching aspects of the game			0
defence has been one such area of development and communication another			0
‘ you just have to be loud			0
it is an area of my game that has got a load better			0
i think it does help the fly - halves if you have another voice outside them telling the right options and where the space is			0
i think that ’s worked very well with me and @entity71 at @entity9			2
’ in an interview with @entity24 last month , the former @entity160 player said he would always stay true to his instincts to seek space rather than try to be something he is not , a crash - ball carrier aiming to force his way over the gainline			0
now that he is back in the @entity0 team he is optimistic that he will be given the licence to cut loose when the chance arises			2
asked if the coaches will allow him to play to his strengths , he said : ‘ i think they ’ll have to ... it ’s a game of rugby and if the right decision is to run , we ’ll run			0
‘ we have to be smart and do it in the right areas , but there ’s no reason with turn - over ball , if there is the opportunity , that we ca n’t run the ball			0
it ’ll be great if we can really attack it and take it to them			0
’ as a player who grew up idolising the likes of @entity193 and @entity194 , there was never any doubt that @entity4 would emerge as a free spirit and that attitude was apparent in his hopes for this high - stakes game			1
@entity0 attack coach @entity200 ( left ) , talks to @entity0 centre pairing @entity15 ( middle ) and @entity4 @entity15 ( left ) passes the ball during @entity0 's training session on thursday ‘ we have a mind - set to play , ’ he said			1
‘ if we have a chance to play and it is on , we ’ll play			0
we do n’t want to waste opportunities			0
we are playing for a reason — we want to be challenging defences			0
’ @entity0 head coach @entity11 echoed @entity71 in extolling @entity4 ’s virtues as a back - line co-ordinator who can take some of the load off the primary playmaker			1
@entity11 has picked him as the form option at @entity69 — in the absence of the injured @entity36 — and must hope that @entity15 can return to the peaks of his early - season displays , before a mini-dip last month			1
elsewhere , the case for the return of @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 among the replacements was made on the basis of their collective experience , which will be so vital amid the maelstrom of a @entity41 in @entity2			2
the same could be said for @entity229 , who is back in the starting back row at blindside flanker			0
@entity0 are much changed , but scarcely weakened			2
@entity232 ( @entity233 ) ; a @entity234 ( @entity9 ) , @entity235 ( @entity9 ) , @entity236 ( @entity16 ) , @entity237 ( @entity238 ) ; @entity239 ( @entity9 ) , @entity240 ( @entity241 ) ; @entity242 ( @entity233 ) , @entity243 ( @entity16 ) , @entity244 ( @entity241 ) ; @entity245 ( @entity9 ) , @entity246 ( @entity247 ) ; @entity248 ( @entity249 ) , @entity250 ( @entity233 , capt ) , @entity251 ( @entity247 )			2

@entity4 will start @entity0 's @entity26 opener against @entity17
the 23 - year - old @entity9 centre will provide a real injection of pace to @entity11 's line - up in midfield
@entity4 has been rewarded for his *remarkably* consistent club form by being recalled for a first @entity41 appearance since june 2013
