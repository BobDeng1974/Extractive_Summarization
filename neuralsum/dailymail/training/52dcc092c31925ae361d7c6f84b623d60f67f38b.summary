police are still struggling to find a single lead on the murder of a 15 - year - old girl two months after she was found strangled and burned			1
@entity4 was last seen sitting on her sister 's porch in @entity8 at 4.30am on august 31			1
her burned body was discovered at 12.30pm the same day in the yard of a home three minutes ' drive away on a busy street			1
detectives have since scoured the area and found her dna in an abandoned property across the street from where she was buried , while an autopsy confirmed she was strangled then burned			1
but despite the detailed forensic evidence from the scene which has round - the - clock traffic , they have not found a single witness and can not pin their suspicions on anyone , simply saying it was ' an unknown random attacker '			1
mystery : @entity4 , 15 , ( left ) went missing on august 31 and despite detailed forensic evidence from the crime scene on a busy @entity8 street , detectives have found nothing , leaving her family ( right ) distraught ' we 're jeopardizing the community by keeping this person out there , ' one of @entity4 's sisters , @entity42 , told the @entity44			1
' the investigation team believes @entity4 - who was visiting the neighborhood - went on to the porch to cool off after an argument with friends			2
a car is then thought to have pulled up outside the property , abducted the 15 - year - old and taken her to the now - abandoned house three minutes away			1
she was strangled to death and then taken across the street where her body was partially burned and buried , officers say			2
they have no idea how many people were involved and can not understand why there are no witnesses that saw @entity4 near the home where she was killed			2
police normally patrolling the street had been called to a shooting at a nearby strip club at around 4:30am			0
however , detectives insist it is strange that the killer managed to take @entity4 into the house and then carry her body and personal effects across the busy street without anyone seeing			1
detective @entity81 , who is leading the investigation for the @entity83 , said : ' there were lots of chances there			0
' according to @entity4 's sisters , she was shy and did not approach strangers			1
after her mother died of @entity94 's disease in 2012 , shortly before two of her best friends were killed in a street fight , @entity4 became quiet , they said			2
call for action : her sisters have blasted the stagnant case for ' jeopardizing the community ' ' i do n't know why you had to do this			1
whatever you do , wherever you go , justice is going to be served , in this life or the next , ' @entity42 raged in an emotional attack on @entity4 's murderer			2
' i do n't care , they will hunt you until you die			0
... she did not deserve this , she did not deserve this , she was 15 years old			0
' in august , detective @entity81 said : ' at this time , we believe it was random ' and described how his team was combing registered sex offenders for possible leads and checking for reported runaways in case there are other victims			0
however , the outlook has not changed in two months			0
@entity81 distributed a photograph of @entity4 taken the last night she was alive			0
in it , she 's smiling and wearing the sandals that were later discovered			0

deputy mayor @entity134 , who lives a few blocks away from where the girl 's body was found , comforted the family at the news conference			0
' pretty young lady , she had a future , and this evil person , or persons , destroyed her life , ' he said .			0
