a handful of peanuts a day may help prevent food poisoning , a study has found			2
eating the kernels without their skins can improve gut health and the ability to ward off bugs like @entity9 , according to the research			0
scientists from the @entity12 found that flour made from peanut kernel significantly stimulated the growth of @entity16 and @entity17 , the type of friendly bacteria more commonly associated with yoghurt drinks			1
eating peanut kernels without their skins can improve gut health and the ability to ward off bugs like @entity9 , according to research by the @entity12 by increasing the amount of good bacteria , the peanut flour was able to reduce the amount of a dangerous bacterium , @entity9 , which can cause severe food poisoning			1
the friendly bacteria out - competes the harmful bacteria by occupying space on intestinal walls and by producing antimicrobial substances			1
four made from peanut kernel stimulates the growth of friendly bacteria , research has found lead researcher dr @entity38 said : ‘ eating approximately 50g of peanut kernels a day could improve the gut microflora and would help to protect against foodborne illnesses caused by common foodborne bacterial pathogens			1
’ when the scientists tested the peanut skin , however , they found it had the opposite effect to the peanut kernel , inhibiting the growth of good bacteria and promoting the growth of the harmful @entity9 and @entity53 bacteria			1
writing in the @entity54 , the researchers concluded : ‘ these results suggest that peanut kernels , by improving the beneficial effect of lactobacillus , might reduce the risk of foodborne pathogens infection in the gut			2
‘ however , the role of peanut skin in human health remains to be further investigated			0
’ @entity9 can be transmitted by eating undercooked meat such as mince , or contaminated vegetables that have n’t been washed properly			0
@entity53 is found in the gut of many animals , especially poultry			0
proper cooking usually destroys it			0
undercooked eggs can also be a source .			0

flour made from peanut kernel *majorly* stimulated growth of friendly bacteria
this means it can lower amount of @entity84 , @entity12 study found
harmful bacteria is out - competed as friendly takes up space on intestine wall
