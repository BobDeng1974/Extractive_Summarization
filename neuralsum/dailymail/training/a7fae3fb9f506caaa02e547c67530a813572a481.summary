on my first full day at the @entity2 hotel , i ’m told that lunch will be cooked by ... me			2
perhaps this is pay - back time from dinner the night before , when the chef presented me with something i can only describe as edible art. i had been faced with amuse - bouches of olives hung on a miniature tree ; a plump , pink disc of yellowfin tuna tartare ; seabass smoked with @entity16 ’s , revealed with a flourish from under an opaque glass dome			1
@entity19 : @entity20 offers gorgeous scenery - such as this picturesque isthmus on @entity24 island it transpires that @entity28 , on the northwest coast of @entity27 , does things differently			1
to immerse guests fully in the local culture , a cooking school called @entity31 is offered - and you get thrown in at the deep end			1
it starts with an 8am visit to the food market in the small , dusty village of @entity27 , a ten - minute drive away , with the hotel ’s chef			1
the market is a cavernous covered space full of stalls selling everything from fresh seafood on ice to buckets of coconut cream , and displays of garlic , ginger , green papaya , mint and more			0
there are containers of home - made red , green and yellow curry pastes , fragrant @entity61 basil and weird fermented cabbages			1
the cooking class takes place at the hotel ’s @entity61 restaurant , which overlooks the rest of the sprawling resort ( 77 villas and suites )			1
two shades of @entity20 : street food is in constant supply in this intriguing country - as is a wealth of scenery on the menu today are shrimp tartlets , green chicken curry and mango with sticky rice			1
before i know it , i ’m mixing batter for tartlet cases , marinading mini-aubergines in coconut milk and curry paste , and simmering the sticky rice ( the trick is to ensure there is just a finger ’s width of water over the rice )			0
@entity27 is roughly the same size as @entity95 , with a population of 600,000			1
it is not particularly known for its charm - the notoriously tacky resort of @entity101 has put paid to that - but it is under two hours away from a truly exquisite archipelago that includes @entity105 ( where @entity106 was shot ) , @entity107 ( home to nothing but a bar ) and an island nicknamed ‘ bamboo ’			1
a boat trip that takes in all these is the perfect way to get a flavour of what draws so many visitors			0
we speed across the turquoise water , passing giant granite islands covered in greenery , stopping off at @entity24 , the larger sister island to @entity123			2
pausing to go snorkelling near a reef among swarms of colourful fish , we then pull in to @entity127 , a body of crystalline , emerald green water surrounded by more hulking stone outcrops of the kind you see on postcards			0
that evening , the head chef does the cooking , thankfully			0
he serves up a delicious soft - shell crab curry , a local dish called @entity140 - a tangle of spicy , crispy egg noodles served with chicken , onion and lime - and a light coconut sorbet			2
somehow , @entity61 food just does n’t taste like this back home			1
a luxury haven : @entity149 rested her head at the gorgeous @entity151 on @entity27 for a different island experience we also visit @entity155 ’s sister resort , @entity156 , on the much smaller island of @entity158			1
its population of around 8,000 doubles once a month as hordes of partygoers descend on @entity165 beach , to the south , for the infamous full moon parties which started here in the @entity169			0
apart from those wild nights , though , it appeals mostly to families and couples , while @entity27 draws a younger crowd			1
the @entity156 is bang on the beach , but has all the design touches of an elegant resort : an infinity pool featuring a swim - up bar , spa and 64 villas and suites , each with their own private plunge pool			2
mine has a carp pond outside , and all have a free mini-bar			0
everything seems to move at a different pace : slowly			0
but there ’s plenty to do : snorkelling or kayaking around the @entity192 - which contains more than 40 tiny islands - elephant trekking , communing with local monks , yoga every morning on the sun terrace			2
yes , there is a cooking school here , too			0
and yes , i could sign up to perfect my @entity202 - but i demur			2
it ’s time to let someone else do the hard work			0
doubles at @entity207 from £ 159 @entity208 , based on two sharing a deluxe pool villa , and at @entity156 ( @entity158 ) from £ 175 @entity208 ( www.anantara.com )			0
flights from £ 550 return with @entity212 ( www.etihad.com )			0

@entity27 is often known as a party island , but also has its *sophisticated* edge
resorts such as @entity155 offer a five - star side of this @entity61 *favourite*
