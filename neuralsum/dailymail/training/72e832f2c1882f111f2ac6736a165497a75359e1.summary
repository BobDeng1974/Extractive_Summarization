a lawsuit was filed on tuesday on behalf of attorney general @entity7 against @entity8 , the owner of @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity3			1
the row emerged last month when @entity8 refused to sell flowers to longtime customers @entity14 and @entity15 for their wedding in september			1
row : a legal fight has broken out over @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity3 , after the owner refused to provide flowers for a gay couple 's wedding she told the couple she would not provide them with her service ' because of [ her ] relationship with @entity26 '			1
@entity7 , who had written to the florist asking her to change her stance two weeks ago , says she is violating the state 's @entity30 , which bars any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation			1
' as attorney general , it is my job to enforce the laws of the state of @entity3 , ' @entity7 said in a statement			1
' under the @entity30 , it is unlawful to discriminate against customers based on sexual orientation			1
if a business provides a product or service to opposite - sex couples for their weddings , then it must provide same sex couples the same product or service			0
' @entity8 on the other hand has won the backing of several groups and has set up a fighting fund to pay for her legal case			1
the small business ' facebook page has become a hotbed of debate on gay marriage and a group has been set up calling for the shop to boycotted			2
on the page @entity8 posted : ' to those who have and do support us , we want to thank you for all your concern and phone calls			1
many have requested a place to send financial support to help with legal defense			0
we have set up a deposit only account with our local @entity75			0
' it goes on to provide the bank details			0
in a statement posted at the time of the refusal , @entity8 refused to back down on what she called ' her conviction '			1
offended : @entity14 says he felt compelled to complain to the attorney general over @entity85 's refusal to provide his wedding flowers ' this customer has been in many times and purchased flowers from us , ' she wrote			1
' when it came to doing his wedding , i said , ' i could not do it because of my relationship with @entity26			1
' he thanked me and said , ' he respected my opinion			0
' we talked and gave each other a hug and he left			0
' since that day , we have received many comments on same sex marriages			0
i believe , biblically , that marriage is between a man and a woman			0
that is my conviction , yours may be different			0
' ' i have hired all walks of people in different circumstances , and had the privilege of working with some very talented people that happen to be gay			2
' ' i ’m sure there are many places you can purchase flowers , if you choose not to purchase them from @entity122 ’s , because of your beliefs , then i certainly understand			2
' lawyers on her behalf wrote to the attorney general making clear she would fight his stance			1
' discrimination is not the issue			2
although gay marriage may be legal in @entity3 for the time being , the concept offends ... ms @entity8 and many others in @entity3 , ' the letter said			1
intervention : attorney general @entity7 , pictured , has filed a lawsuit against @entity8 , the owner of @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity3 the very same day the legal bid was launched a worker left the florist in objection to her boss ' stance			1
@entity145 , who had worked there for a year and a half told the @entity148 : ' some things are more important than money , and i felt making a stand by quitting -- just not doing something completely against my beliefs -- was very important to me			2
' @entity7 wants a permanent injunction against the florist forcing her to comply - possibly leaving her with a $ 2,000 fine			1
@entity14 said it was a difficult decision to raise the issue with the attorney general but the couple ultimately felt it was the right thing to do			1
@entity14 told the @entity148 : ' it really hurt because it was somebody i knew			2
we laid awake all night			0
it was eating at our souls			0
there was never a question she 'd be the one to do our flowers			2
' ' we 're both passionate about seeing people succeed and that nobody should be hurt or in pain			0
' ' this is one of those things -- it 's very hurtful			2
i probably have n't felt this much pain since i was in high school and people called me names , and i 'm 42			0
' ' people are going to hate us , ' he added			0
' that is sad and makes me unhappy			0
i know people are going to come out of the woodwork and going to be hateful			0
i do n't say hateful things			0
i 'm not that kind of person			0
