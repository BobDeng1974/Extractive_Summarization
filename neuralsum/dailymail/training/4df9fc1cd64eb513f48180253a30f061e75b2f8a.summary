she said : ' before i gave it to my friend i put it on @entity56 as a test just to see what would happen with a ridiculously high price to make sure it would n't sell			2
finding fame : her dolls have become so popular that @entity29 , wife of rocker @entity30 , was recently given one on a @entity33 chat show creation : ' the thing which sets me aside from artists who make monster babies is that mine are genuine reborn dolls			1
