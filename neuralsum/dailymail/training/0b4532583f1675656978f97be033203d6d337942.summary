by @entity0 nicknamed streaks due to their speed and sleek lines , they were the pride of @entity7 ’s railways			2
the @entity9 class locomotives were built in the @entity10 to haul the fastest express passenger trains from @entity12 to @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
with their revolutionary design inspired by @entity19 race cars , they were the first of their kind to speed along the tracks at 90 to 100mph , 25mph faster than their predecessors			2
the world 's fastest steam locomotive , @entity27 ( far right ) and six of her sister trains were gathered in @entity31 , @entity32 , yesterday @entity27 still holds the record for the fastest steam locomotive ever at 126mph , a speed which electric trains reach every day today the @entity9 class locomotives were used to transport high - speed passenger carriges between @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 as well as @entity27 , the six include sir @entity40 - named after the designer - @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 in their heyday , it was every schoolboy ’s dream to drive one — and they still evoke all the romance of the golden age of steam , when @entity7 still meant best			1
now the last remaining six have been reunited for one final time			0
among them is the legendary @entity27 , which still holds the record for the fastest steam locomotive in the world after hitting 126mph at @entity59 , near @entity60 on the @entity62 main line in 1938 — a record that ’s unlikely ever to be beaten			1
the attempt was set up amid great secrecy , not only because the @entity66 had achieved over 120mph , but also because rival companies in @entity7 could have stolen a march on the daring record bid			2
it was driven that day by @entity71 , 61 , assisted by fireman @entity72 , whose back - breaking job it was to shovel tons of coal into the white - heat firebox as the rocking train hurtled down the track			0
world beater : the @entity27 pictured in 1938 as it was about to start its record - breaking run along the @entity62 when it hit 126mph success : the team from @entity27 celebrate their record run near @entity87 75 years ago			1
the challenge was so intense it left the loco in need of repair in action : the sir @entity93 takes passengers across @entity95 from @entity96 to settle , travelling through @entity97 they do n't make them like that anymore : the @entity42 departs from @entity101 in @entity97 as part of the ' @entity104 ' train service the 75th anniversary of that epic event , in july last year , triggered the bringing together of the six locos			1
they are the only surviving examples of the 35 of their kind that were designed by genius sir @entity40 for the @entity113 and which marked the zenith of @entity7 locomotive building			1
polished , oiled and gleaming , the six 100 - ton steam locos have been lined up side by side for a week - long display named the @entity121 at the @entity123 ’s site at @entity31 , @entity32			1
two — @entity44 and @entity43 — were brought over from museums on the other side of the @entity126 for the reunion , which is attracting tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world			1
like @entity27 , which is part of @entity7 ’s @entity123 collection , those two are no longer in running order , but merely exhibited in gleaming condition			1
every boy 's dream : many children dreamed of driving a steam locomotive , here we explain how the controls of @entity27 worked great gathering : over the last four days 50,000 people have gathered at the @entity123 to see the six engines together sizing up : the fearsome machines were not just epic in terms of ability , but also sheer scale , as this picture shows labour of love : @entity151 works on the cosmetically restored @entity44 at the @entity123 in @entity13 but the other three — @entity42 , sir @entity40 and @entity41 , owned by separate rail enthusiasts — still earn a living hauling steam charters on the main line			1
@entity157 , senior curator of rail vehicle collections at the museum , said : ‘ these locos were built to create an impression and they definitely still do ! the drivers were the fastest men on earth — the @entity165 drivers or airline pilots of their day			0
‘ these were prestige trains and to be in charge of one was exciting and glamorous			0
’ the design was a massive success in public relations terms — the public adored them			0
one of the @entity175 — fuelled by up to seven tons of coal — could race between @entity12 and @entity15 , picking up water on the move from long troughs laid between the rails			0
because the work of the two men of the footplate — the driver and fireman — was so arduous , @entity40 designed a tiny corridor through the tender that would allow a relief crew to take over on the move			1
precision engineering : @entity40 , who designed the trains , had intended for them to eventually reach 130mph , but that dream was never realised namesake : among the visitors was one @entity195 who was born in 1951 and named after the locomotive @entity42 , sir @entity40 and @entity41 , which are owned by separate rail enthusiasts , still earn a living hauling steam charters on the main line soon after @entity27 ’s record - breaking run — which left the workings of the thrashed loco needing some repair — @entity206 would put an end to the most glamorous era on @entity7 railways , with the glorious streaks stripped of some of their streamlining for the duration and plodding along at more pedestrian speeds , their paintwork stained and dirty			1
@entity40 ’s hopes of even higher speeds — 130mph was thought possible — went unfulfilled			2
then diesel and electric locos took over from the @entity221 and today reach the once amazing speed of 125mph on a daily basis			2
but most railwaymen admit today ’s trains lack the glamour and looks of the @entity210			0
and yesterday , the surviving @entity175 were back at their gleaming best			0
among the visitors was one @entity195 — who was born in 1951 and named after the locomotive			2
his father was not only a railway enthusiast , but also a loco driver with the rival @entity232			0
the museum has copied his birth certificate for their records			0
a one enthusiast said : ‘ these locos were just superb , and still are			0
after all , you ca n’t imagine some - one naming their child after a diesel , can you ? ’			0

six @entity9 class locomotive brought together to celebrate @entity27 's steam speed world record 75 years ago
@entity27 reached 126mph on the @entity62 line near @entity87 in 1938 , a record which still stands
more than 50,000 people have so far visited the six engines which are at the @entity123
other engines are sir @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44
