by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:21 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 06:17 est , 12 march 2014 the @entity4 epic about @entity5 has managed to unite @entity6 and @entity7			1
members of the two religions - at odds for more than a thousand years - are singing with one voice to condemn the £ 75million film @entity13 for its take on the @entity15 hero			1
the blockbuster has already been banned in three @entity18 countries after religious leaders complained that it depicted the @entity15 figure - who is also a prophet in the @entity23			1
fatwa : @entity13 , a blockbuster starring @entity26 , pictured , has been banned in three @entity18 countries and three more could soon follow after a fatwa was issued against it by leading figures in @entity31 @entity33 's messenger : @entity13 , said to have built an ark ( pictured ) which saved the human and animal worlds from a great flood , features in @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity31 , but depicting @entity42 's messengers is banned due to première later this month , the film will not show in @entity44 , @entity45 or the @entity46 and several other countries are expected to follow suit			1
but it appears that @entity50 's devout @entity6 are also annoyed about the portrayal of the antediluvian patriarch , claiming after test screenings that director @entity54 had made him ' too dark '			1
in exchange for his eight - figure budget , the auteur filmmaker was forced to allow backer @entity59 to conduct as many as half a dozen test screenings to test the waters while work was still in progress			2
a representative of an @entity67 pentecostal megachurch present for one warned the hollywood reporter : ' if you 're expecting it to be word for word from the @entity73 , you 're in for a shock			0
' there can be an opportunity for @entity6 to take offence			2
' another viewer at a separate test screening was more blunt , saying it depictued @entity13 as a ' crazy , irrational , religious nut ' who is obsessed with apparently modern day problems like overpopulation			1
fatwa : @entity87 's @entity86 ( which includes the mosque pictured left ) issued a fatwa , which is a ruling under @entity91 law , saying the film starring @entity26 ( right ) as @entity13 was a ' clear violation ' of their teachings @entity96 : the film is due to premiere in the @entity50 on march 28 and was due to air in @entity99 in the near future the criticisms come as of the world 's most respected @entity91 institutions issued a fatwa against the @entity4 epic because it ' contradicts the teachings of @entity31 '			1
@entity31 forbids representing holy figures in art , instead using conceptual line patterns and lettering to adorn the walls of mosques			2
@entity113 ( 1852 ) by @entity114 @entity115 : as well as being banned in the southern @entity50 for objecting to slavery , it was outlawed by @entity118 in @entity119 who felt it ' undermined religious ideals '			2
@entity122 ( 1958 ) by @entity123 @entity124 : a gritty account of a boy 's awakening in a youth prison , the book was believed to have been banned due to several aspects including its depictions of adolescent sexuality and the @entity134			2
@entity135 ( 1974 ) by @entity136 @entity137 ( various ) : the horror story of a shy schoolgirl with horrific telekinetic powers is one of the most banned books in @entity50 schools for its violence and treatment of religion			2
the @entity147 ( 1988 ) by @entity148 muslim : the book , which challenged a key story of the @entity152 , led to a fatwa being issued against the author and an assassination attempt by extremists			0
the @entity157 : an @entity158 ( 2009 ) by academic @entity159 @entity157 : @entity160 withdrew copies of the previously little - known work after religious campaigners made several complaints , including that a deity on the front cover was having her breasts touched by another figure			0
sources : @entity171 and banned books a whole chapter of the @entity23 is devoted to @entity13 , who legend tells built an ark which saved himself , his family and many pairs of animals from a great flood			1
he also features prominently in the @entity15 book of @entity181 and is revered by @entity6 and @entity182			2
the fatwa - a ruling or injunction under the laws of @entity31 - was made by the influential @entity188 institution in @entity99 's capital @entity87 , a centre of @entity31 thought which was founded in around @entity191 and includes a university and a mosque			1
' @entity188 ... renews its objection to any act depicting the messengers and prophets of @entity33 and the @entity200 ( @entity201 ) , peace be upon him , ' it announced in a statement			1
the fatwa added that the depictions ' provoke the feelings of believers ... and are forbidden in @entity31 and a clear violation of islamic law '			2
the film also stars @entity210 and @entity211 and will premiere in the @entity50 on march 28			1
depictions of the @entity201 in @entity214 and @entity215 media have repeatedly sparked deadly protests in @entity91 countries over the last decade , fanning cultural tensions with the @entity219			0
the worst riots were triggered after the @entity201 was depicted in a @entity222 newspaper in 2006			0
it sparked protests in the @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 in which at least 50 people died			0
a spokesman for @entity230 said : ' censors for @entity44 , @entity45 and the @entity232 ( @entity46 ) officially confirmed this week that the film will not release in their countries			1
' the official statement they offered in confirming this news is because " it contradicts the teachings of @entity31 " , ' the representative said , adding the studio expected a similar ban in @entity99 , @entity242 and @entity243			2
perhaps wisely the filming took place nowhere near the @entity225 , instead being carried out in @entity246 and in @entity247			0
@entity248 star @entity211 plays the adopted daughter of the prophet , while screen legend @entity210 stars as his sagely grandfather			0
@entity252 will play @entity253 , @entity13 's wife			1
she won an @entity254 for best supporting actress for her appearance alongside @entity26 in @entity257 ( 2001 )			0
the title role was reportedly offered to @entity260 and @entity261 - both of whom declined			0
@entity262 , president of a conservative @entity263 ( @entity263 ) group , said last month he wanted to ' make sure everyone who sees this impactful film knows this is an imaginative interpretation of @entity267 , and not literal			0
' @entity59 responded by agreeing to issue a disclaimer on advertising for the film			0
' while artistic license has been taken , we believe that this film is true to the essence , values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide , ' it reads			1
1 ) @entity282 - the @entity281 film enraged @entity6 with its irreverent take on the @entity286 story satirised through an account of a fictional contemporary called @entity289			1
2 ) @entity291 director @entity290 received death threats after he turned his sharp humour on the @entity294 with this film , which was met by organised protests in some countries			0
3 ) @entity298 - this inflammatory @entity299 video , which sparked outrage in the @entity91 world , was packed with incendiary @entity303 content			0
it was removed from @entity299 this month after an actor duped by the film 's producer took @entity307 to court			0
stars : @entity26 as @entity13 with @entity252 , who plays his wife @entity253 and won an @entity254 for best supporting actress for her appearance alongside @entity26 in a beautiful mind the film is not the first to stoke controversy among @entity7			1
@entity317 's 2004 film @entity316 , showing @entity286 's crucifixion , was widely screened in the @entity319 despite objections by @entity91 clerics			0
a 2012 , an amateur @entity323 video deriding the @entity201 which was produced in @entity324 stoked protests throughout the region , and may have contributed to a deadly militant raid in @entity328 which killed the @entity50 ambassador and three other @entity215 staff .			0

censors for @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity232 said it went against teachings of @entity31
@entity87 's @entity188 said it objected to any depictions of @entity33 's messengers
test screen viewers in @entity50 complained @entity13 's depiction was ' too dark '
@entity13 revered by @entity7 as well as @entity6 and has a chapter in @entity23
@entity230 admitted the film takes ' artistic license ' with ark legend
*biblical* epic depicting *axe* - wielding @entity26 is due to premiere on march 28
