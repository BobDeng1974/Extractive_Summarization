' the campaign was pushing for change , ' said @entity0 , ' not just for myself but for all the fans out there			0
to have that all fall away is so disappointing , and i think people need to know what @entity4 is doing			0

instead of broadcasting the grand final which is one of the biggest sporting events of the year , they have let down fans and chosen money			2
' airing on @entity20 at the time of the grand final on saturday are episodes of @entity124 , motoring programs , @entity126 and a collectible show called @entity128			2
@entity0 is now campaigning for awareness , calling for a boycott of sponsors of the @entity1 and deliberately spreading information about hd options			0

was promised by @entity14 that the @entity1 grand final would be broadcast in high definition
managing director @entity13 asked him to keep the commitment confidential

@entity4 is choosing *monetary* gains over the desires of fans
