by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 19:41 est , 25 october 2012 work and pensions secretary @entity2 will today call for more welfare changes jobless couples with more than two children should have benefit payments limited , @entity2 suggested yesterday			1
the @entity2 said there were ‘ large numbers ’ of couples on welfare having big families – unlike middle - income parents who had to weigh up if they could afford to have another child			1
mr @entity2 condemned the ‘ madness ’ of the state subsidising large workless families – saying it would be fairer to the ‘ vast majority ’ of responsible taxpayers if benefits were limited to the first two children in future			1
he has agreed to find another £ 10billion in welfare savings by 2016 , having already slashed £ 18billion from a vast budget that grew by 60 per cent under @entity24			2
as well as cuts to child benefit and tax credits for large workless families , he suggested housing benefit could be stripped for those who expected to go straight from school on to welfare and a state - subsidised house			1
@entity35 sources , however , warned nothing had been agreed and suggested the proposals were ‘ just @entity38 kite - flying ’			1
a senior @entity35 source said : ‘ it does n’t even save very much money as we ’ve already introduced a benefits cap			1
’ but mr @entity2 said more reforms were vital as the government sought to control public finances			1
he dismissed suggestions the @entity49 was ‘ hurting ’ claimants – insisting the real cruelty was leaving people languishing on welfare for years			2
‘ we have accepted for far too long in this country that it is possible for people to just stay on benefits , ’ he said			0
‘ it is all about saying , we will give you massive support to find work ... but also , we have an expectation , as the taxpayer pays for these bills , that you try your hardest to find work			0
’ most controversially , mr @entity2 suggested the present system encouraged poorer families to have large numbers of children without worrying about the cost			2
' an end to never - ending benefits ' : the government plans to restrict housing benefit to the under - 25s ‘ when you look at families across the board , at all incomes , you find the vast , vast majority make decisions about the kind of numbers of children they have , the families they want , based on what they think they can afford , ’ he said			1
‘ where you see the clustering of the large families is really down at the very lowest incomes , those on significant levels of welfare , and those on the very top incomes			0
in other words , the problem for those who are paying the taxes , paying the bills – they make the decisions about their lives , even if they sometimes would like to maybe have extra children , they make decisions			0
‘ people who are having support through welfare are often free from that decision			0
we want to support people if they have children when they are out of work , of course			0
‘ but can there not be a limit to the fact that really you need to remember you need to cut your cloth in accordance with what capabilities and what finances you have ? ’ in his speech to the @entity123 think - tank , he suggested only welfare claimants having children in future would be affected , not existing families			2
@entity128 , of the @entity129 , said : ‘ when parents plan their families they ’re not thinking about whether at some point in future they might be on benefit			0
’ @entity136 , @entity24 ’s work and pensions spokesman , said : ‘ the truth is it ’s working people who are seeing their help axed			0
