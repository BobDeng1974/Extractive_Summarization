by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 09:02 est , 6 march 2013 switching off a certain gene could stop junk food eaters from gaining weight switching off a ' fat ' gene could prevent you from piling on the pound even if you stick to a high - fat diet , say researchers			1
a two - year study found that removing this gene in mice made them resistant to obesity			1
the animals showed unusual restraint when fed a high - calorie diet and were more active as well			0
' when fed a diet that induces obesity these mice do nâ€™t get fat , ' said study author professor @entity21 from the @entity22			1
' it may be possible to duplicate this in humans using existing technology that targets this specific gene			2
' the absence of the gene may cause fat to be broken down faster by the body , he said			2
the research team created a strain of mice without the @entity37 gene , which humans also possess			1
it produces a protein that regulates fat storage and metabolism			0
they found their fat cells were 20 per cent smaller than typical mice and did not show the kind of inflammation usually associated with obesity			1
obesity - associated fatty liver disease , common in obese humans and rodents alike , was absent in the mice without the @entity53 gene			1
' the mice were healthier , ' prof @entity21 said			0
fat cells were 20 per cent smaller in mice without the @entity37 gene ' they had lower triglyceride levels , they were more insulin - sensitive , they had no incidents of fatty liver disease and there was less inflammation in the fat cells			1
' the findings suggest switching off the @entity53 gene may lower the risk of heart disease ( triglycerides are fatty molecules involved in the hardening of the arteries ) and diabetes			0
' it could mean that we have finally discovered a way to disrupt obesity in humans			2
that would be a major breakthrough , ' @entity79			0
the team next want to know how the gene alteration works physiologically and better understand how it affects food consumption			0
according to the study , understanding how @entity37 is involved in the control of energy balance will provide new insights into ' the mechanisms by which nutrition overload is detected , and how individuals adapt to , or fail to adapt to , dietary challenges			0
' the study , funded by the @entity92 was published in @entity93 .			0

removing @entity37 gene made mice resistant to obesity
fat cells were 20 *%* smaller and rodents also ate less
*scientists* think the effect could be duplicated in humans
