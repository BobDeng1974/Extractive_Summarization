one in twenty who took part in poll of 2,000 said formal ' thank you ' was not often needed in everyday conversation by @entity5 last updated at 12:46 pm on 24th november 2011 cheers : one in 20 people say ' nice one ' , while younger generations are more likely to offer a ' cool ' than a thank you for many a traditionalist , it is the most important two - word phrase in our vocabulary			1
but ‘ thank you ’ is falling by the wayside , replaced increasingly with less formal expressions of gratitude , a poll reveals			1
although the average person will say ' thank you ' nearly 5,000 times a year , one in three are more likely to throw in a ' cheers ' or ' ta ' where it 's needed , rather than risk sounding old fashioned			1
one in 20 now say ' nice one ' instead , while younger generations are more likely to offer a ' cool ' than a thank you			1
' @entity27 ' , ' fab ' and even ' gracias ' were also listed as common phrases to use , as was ' much appreciated '			1
one in twenty who took part in the poll of 2,000 people by the @entity34 @entity33 for @entity35 , which is marked on november 24 said a formal ' thank you ' was now not often needed in everyday conversation			1
@entity37 , managing director of @entity34 @entity33 , said : ' when it comes to saying ' thank you ' , people will always find the way that works best for them and it 's interesting to see what the act means to different people			1
' the fact that over a quarter of us choose to say thank you through food highlights that taking the time and effort to say ' thanks ' is still very important to us			1
' a massive 95 per cent of respondents to the poll claimed manners are important , with eight in ten @entity33 believing their etiquette is spot on			1
having said that , more than one in ten adults said they regularly wo n't say thank you if they are in a bad mood			2
poor show : inattentive service is seen as a good reason to remain tight - lipped but despite being quick to talk up their own politeness , it seems most people are not clear on the bigger picture			2
when asked if @entity33 was a polite country for example , opinion was split down the middle			1
most people claimed that saying thank you was something drilled into them by their parents , but four in ten will utter a thank you purely out of habit			2
and while eight in ten people think they could show more appreciation , a third of respondents barely even acknowledge what they 're doing when they say thank you			2
a huge 70 per cent of those questioned will say thank you to a person 's face without even meaning it , while a fifth avoid saying it when they know they should - on at least two occasions every day			2
a total of 95 per cent claim manners are important			2
eight in ten believe their etiquette is spot on			0

another quarter of @entity33 say thank you with food - with 23 per cent cooking a meal to show their appreciation another 15 per cent will bake a cake			1
a third will send a handwritten thank you note - but 45 per cent admit its been more than six months since they sent one			0
it seems our friends and family get the brunt of our bad manners with half admitting they 're rubbish at thanking those closest to them - many justifying the lack of thanks because their family ' already know i 'm grateful			0
' when spoken words wo n't do , it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people			0
a thank you email is also popular , while a quarter turn to social networks to express gratitude			0
and while people seem happy to say thanks digitally , six out of ten are adamant it 's no easier to thank someone by email than in person			0

another 15 per cent bake a cake			0
a third will still send a handwritten thank you note - but 45 per cent confess its been more than six months since they bothered to send one			0
it follows that 85 per cent of people will be annoyed at not getting the gratitude they feel they deserve			0
it emerged that one in three believe people say thank you a lot less now than in previous generations , while most thought the world could do with showing more gratitude			0
anger is the biggest reason for not saying thank you , while poor service is seen as a good reason to remain tight lipped .			0
