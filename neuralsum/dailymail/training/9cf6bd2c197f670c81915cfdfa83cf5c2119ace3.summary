by @entity0 most gps think that @entity3 treatment for migrants is ‘ too generous ’ and are refusing to register some patients who are in this country illegally			1
some doctors warn that surgeries ‘ ca n’t cope ’ with the rising numbers of overseas patients coming in for free care , a poll has found			1
last year new @entity3 guidelines told gps they had to register all foreigners including tourists on short holidays , students and illegal immigrants			1
welcome ? most gps think that @entity3 treatment for migrants is ' too generous ' and refuse to register some patients who are in this country illegally once signed up , they would be entitled to the same @entity3 care as all other patients and can receive free blood tests , jabs and - in some cases - free prescription drugs			1
but a poll of 229 family doctors by @entity32 found that 58 per cent believe these rules are too generous			0
and 36 per cent will refuse to register patients they suspect are living here illegally - even though they are breaching these new guidelines			1
one unnamed doctor warned the health service would come under increasing strain next year when thousands of @entity41 and @entity42 arrive to find jobs			2
it is estimated that as many as 70,000 migrants from these two countries will come to @entity47 when temporary controls on their numbers expire			2
the senior @entity50 said : ‘ there is an increasing burden of patients coming to the @entity47 who are entitled to treatment - but whether we can afford an open - ended system in the future is a matter for debate			1
‘ the @entity47 has got to decide what it can and ca n’t afford and who is eligible			0
the problem is that everyone tiptoes around the issue			0
‘ i treat a lot of migrants and asylum seekers , quite happily , but i think there needs to be a public debate			0
migration : @entity41 nationals queuing up outside the @entity73 in @entity74 for visa applications in 2006			0
up to 70,000 @entity41 and @entity42 are expected to arrive in the country ‘ it ’s going to become an increasing issue as we get people from countries like @entity41 and @entity42 becoming eligible for @entity3 treatment in 2014			1
’ dr @entity83 , a gp who practises in @entity85 , near @entity86 said : ‘ you could argue whether it is fair for visitors and migrants to have entitlement to @entity3 treatment when that is not reciprocated			2
’ ‘ gps are expected to practise with limited healthcare funding and if we are using that money for treating visitors , the taxpayer loses out			0
it may be more appropriate to have a system where we say that if you ca n’t provide proof of residence , you have to pay for treatment			0
’ the rules regarding overseas patients are extremely complex and even doctors struggle to understand them			1
by law , such patients are not allowed free hospital treatment - unless urgent - and should be made to pay for x-rays , operations and appointments			0
but there is concern that once foreign patients are registered with a gp , they can easily access free hospital care as staff rarely check their backgrounds			2
figures show that foreign patients owe the @entity3 £ 40 million in unpaid hospital bills			2
last year nearly 3,600 ‘ overseas visitors ’ have had hospital operations or treatment worth at least £ 1,000 a time			0
the @entity126 is currently reviewing the provision of @entity3 treatment for foreigners and may decide to charge them for ‘ primary care , ’ or gp services			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the review is looking at whether we could introduce charges into primary care and how that would work			0

they warn surgeries ' ca *n't* cope ' with rising numbers of overseas patients
@entity3 guidelines told @entity94 they had to register all foreigners including tourists
they would then be entitled to same @entity3 care as all other patients
but one gp warned of ' increasing burden ' next with changes to controls
