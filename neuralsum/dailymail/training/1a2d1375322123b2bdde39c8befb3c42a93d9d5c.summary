by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 30 november 2012 the captain of this cruise ship may well be wondering if his clever short - cut was a good idea after all			2
his vessel had to be dragged creaking and scraping through the @entity7 , a man - made waterway that cuts through @entity9 between the @entity10 to the east and the @entity12 to the west			1
at 154 - feet wide , the jagged passageway is barely the width of a football pitch and is so narrow that most modern ocean freighters are unable to pass through without either getting wedged or severely damaging their paintwork			2
tight fit : at 154 - feet wide , the jagged passageway is barely the width of a football pitch and is so narrow that most modern ocean freighters are unable to pass through without either getting wedged or severely damaging their paintwork but for those that can , it saves the 430 - mile journey all the way around the @entity30 - more than a day 's sailing			1
unsurprisingly , ships can only pass through the canal one at a time on a one - way system , while larger ships have to be towed by tugs			2
easy does it : unsurprisingly , ships can only pass through the canal one at a time on a one - way system , while larger ships have to be towed by tugs difficult task : the man - made canal is nowadays mostly used by tourist ships			1
but it was conceived in 620 bc by the tyrant of @entity48 before various rulers through the ages continued the work until it was finished in 1869 the canal is nowadays mostly used by tourist ships as cargo vessels have grown too big over the ages			1
it was conceived in 620 bc by the tyrant of @entity48			1
but he was over-ruled by the @entity59 who feared upsetting @entity60 , the sea god , and so built a roadway instead			0
around 300 years later , @entity63 , the @entity64 king , began building the canal , but it was the roman emperor @entity67 who , in 66 ad , moved the work into top gear by importing 6,000 prisoners from @entity71 to do the digging			0
he was sentenced to death two years later , bringing work to a halt			0
@entity76 cut : the @entity7 is a man - made waterway that cuts through @entity9 between the @entity10 to the east and the @entity12 to the west some 1,600 years after that , the @entity80 , who then controlled the @entity30 , took up the baton			1
but it was not until 1869 that @entity85 , the @entity86 architect of the @entity87 , came along and finished it off in 11 years			0
part of the problem was that builders had to cut a 250ft - deep channel through rock			0
now the canal , 24.6 metres wide and 7.5 metres deep , is used by 12,000 vessels a year .			0

the @entity7 is a man - made waterway that cuts through @entity9 , between the @entity10 to the east and the @entity12 to the west
it saves a 430 - mile journey all the way around the @entity30 - more than a day 's sailing - and operates a one - way only system
it was conceived in 620 bc by the tyrant of @entity48 before various rulers through the ages continued digging until its *completion* in 1869
