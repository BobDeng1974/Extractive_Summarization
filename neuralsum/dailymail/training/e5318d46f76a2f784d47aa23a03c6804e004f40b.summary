‘ young people in this country deserve an education system that can compete with the best in the world , a system which sets – and achieves – higher expectations			2
’ his reforms prompted complaints from teaching union leaders , while other critics expressed concern that the @entity45 had cast doubt on the achievements of pupils who will take the current gcse over the next two years			2
but mr @entity2 insisted an over-reliance on coursework had ‘ corrupted the credibility of grades ’ and warned that so many students were now achieving @entity55 and a * s that employers could not differentiate between the brightest			1
@entity23 agreed there was a need to reform exam grades , but defended the use of coursework			1
the new - look @entity3 , which have yet to be named but are being nicknamed ‘ @entity62 ’ , will include no coursework except in a small number of areas such as science practicals			2

at least a quarter of the course will cover the history of the wider world			2
mr @entity2 won unlikely support from left - wing firebrand @entity111 yesterday – leading him to declare that he was ‘ in love ’ with her			1
during commons exchanges after the @entity21 outlined his new gcses , miss @entity111 said : ‘ do you agree with me that an emphasis on rigorous education and an emphasis on attaining core academic subjects is not , as is sometimes argued , contrary to the interests of working class children and black and ethnic minority children ? ‘ on the contrary , precisely if you are the first in your family to stay on past school leaving age , precisely if your family does n’t have social capital , precisely if you do n’t have parents who can put in a word for you in a difficult job market , you need the assurance of rigorous qualifications and if at all possible core academic qualifications			1
’ to howls of laughter , mr @entity2 replied : ‘ i am in love			1
if i had been a member of the @entity23 , i would have voted for you for leader			0

education minister @entity200 said current exams were ‘ not fit for purpose ’			0
she added : ‘ for too long we have pretended that students ’ results are getting better , whereas actually all that has been happening is that exams have been getting easier and there has been a race to the bottom between exam boards			2
we need to stop that happening now			0
’ but @entity23 education spokesman @entity212 said : ‘ pupils and parents will be concerned by the uncertainty that @entity2 has created around @entity3			1
‘ we need changes to assessments in schools that will strengthen rigour and reflect the best ways of testing skills and knowledge			0
‘ encouraging more shallow learning of facts alone will not help young people to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow			0
