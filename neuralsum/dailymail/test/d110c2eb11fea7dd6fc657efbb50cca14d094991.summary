@entity25 , dr @entity9 , is now the only doctor available across two rural practices , that serve 4,300 patients in @entity11 ( file picture posed by models ) dr @entity9 is based at @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , pictured			1
he said : ' we cover a rural area from two sites so it is now going to prove incredibly difficult to provide a realistic , safe service for our patients , but we will endeavour to do so ' ' we used to be a three - partner practice , which cares for 4,300 patients and a very large holiday population in the summer , ' dr @entity9 said			1
' we cover a rural area from two sites so it is now going to prove incredibly difficult to provide a realistic , safe service for our patients , but we will endeavour to do so			1
' dr @entity9 , who is based at @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , said he fears areas such as the @entity47 in @entity11 will become ' no - go ' areas for young , aspiring gps as none of them want to jump on a ' sinking ship '			2
he added : ' i want the health board to recognise the severity of the situation here			1
' we have been informing the health authority of this impending recruitment crisis for many years			0
' unfortunately little , if anything , has been done and the system is now at breaking point			2
' i would be grateful if the health board could use all resources at their disposal to do all that they can so that we can retain a decent service to our patients which is safe , and provide it to the highest possible standards			1
' ninety per cent of @entity68 consultations are provided in primary care			2
' it is inevitable that the continued lack of investment in primary care is having a knock - on effect on secondary care			0
' when there are 10 ambulances sat outside the @entity80 department of the local district general hospital on a daily basis , it does not take a genius to work out that the system is broken			0
' subsequently , response times for ambulances are not met , @entity80 departments are full to bursting , every hospital bed is taken as there is chronic under capacity			0
' gps are sent daily e-mails requesting that we should n't admit patients unnecessarily			0
' due to unrelenting pressure on beds , patients are often discharged too soon , and without adequate social care provision			2
' this is a year - round problem , no longer to be blamed on winter pressures			0
' the system is broken			0
anyone who denies this simply does not understand			0
' a spokesperson for @entity106 said : ' senior medical staff and managers recently met with dr @entity9 to discuss his concerns			0
dr @entity9 said ambulances queuing at @entity80 departments is a sign that the system is broken ' difficulties in recruiting @entity21 is a national issue ; however , there are particular problems in specific areas of north wales			1
' we fully recognise these issues and work is ongoing to identify and agree measures to alleviate the immediate problems and to develop a strong recruitment base			0
' we are currently exploring a number of short and long - term ideas to address the local shortage of @entity21 , including taking advantage of the opportunities arising from cluster working and working together with other practices			1
' we work very closely with the @entity134 and university medical schools to provide good training opportunities for doctors in @entity11 and encourage them to then apply for jobs in the region			2

he warns the @entity68 is at ' breaking point ' adding that it will be ' incredibly difficult to provide realistic , safe service for our patients '
