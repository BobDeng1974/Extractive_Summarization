on the evening of june 2 , 1993 , flushed with the joy of having finished my final exams in history , and by several celebratory glasses of wine , i took it upon myself to stand up in one of the dining rooms of my @entity10 college — in front of a number of fellows — and burst into song			1
among the audience were the nation ’s future bankers and barristers , plus a fellow history undergraduate who would one day become chancellor of the exchequer : @entity21			1
dressed in a suit and a dark green tie , my voice echoing around the wood panelling of that beautiful room in @entity25 , i launched into the egomaniac ’s hymn to self - indulgence , my way			0
no 1 fan : @entity33 at @entity25 , @entity10 in february 1991 with his @entity34 ‘ and now the end is near , and so i face the final curtain ... ’ it seemed a fitting song with which to salute my last days among old friends at a much - loved institution			1
but that was n’t why i chose my way			0
it was n’t the song i liked , but the singer			0
many people know my way as a @entity48 tune , but for me it was the version sung by @entity50 that had my heart			1
i carefully imitated his precise , much - rehearsed cadences , his pauses and that deep , @entity55 - meets - @entity57 accent			0
by then , i knew it so very well			0
though my books have included a treatise on @entity61 and a reflection on @entity64 architecture , my latest is on what has been perhaps my greatest passion : @entity34			1
from the age of six , my life orbited around him			2
in 1978 , i stumbled on my first @entity34 record , buried in a stack of my parents ’ @entity72 — otherwise classical — behind the telly in my @entity75 childhood home			1
obsessions do n’t spring to life fully formed			2
@entity34 began as a mild interest , a glimpse of something that only later hooked deeply into me			1
i liked @entity50 ; i did n’t yet love him			1
as i grew up , i cast aside other childish things , but the interest in @entity34 kept growing steadily for a decade			1
@entity34 the pelvis : a young @entity50 showing off the moves that made his name in my early adolescence , i moved on to more fashionable singers , such as @entity90 and — i admit it — the @entity92			1
back then , i liked to think that listening to them was an act of rebellion , but , as with most teenage fads , these bands were conventional , drawn from a handful of supposedly edgy groups , which were , in fact , sanctioned by everyone else in my set			0
towards the end of my time at school , as i grew more confident and was prepared to be a little different , i put aside those fads and returned to @entity34			1
then my real obsession began — created by the unique combination of his name , looks and extraordinary voice			2
what i wanted more than anything was to visit @entity113 , @entity34 ’s home in @entity114			1
in 1991 , aged 19 and during my holidays from @entity10 , i arranged to spend a summer in @entity116			1
today , 23 years on , i still remember the ecstatic thrill as the tourist minibus crossed @entity119 and rolled through @entity113 ’s gates , twisted into the shape of musical notes and a pair of wrought iron elvises brandishing guitars			1
the bus halted outside the portico , where we were met by an @entity130 tour guide , an undergraduate at @entity132			0
like me , he had been allowed to work in @entity116 thanks to a student visa			2
his job seemed far more enviable than mine , working for a conservative think - tank in @entity138 i remember the real , burning jealousy i felt for that tour guide			0
it intensified that evening when i bumped into him in a diner near my motel in suburban @entity114			1
‘ do you get to go upstairs ? ’ i asked , trying to mask my excitement			0
upstairs — banned to visitors — was @entity34 ’s bedroom and the bathroom he died in			1
was he allowed into @entity34 ’s parents ’ room , then still lived in by @entity34 ’s aunt , @entity154 ? ‘ afraid not , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s for family only			0
not sure i ’d be that interested anyway , i ’m not really an @entity34 fan			1
’ not an @entity34 fan ! the blind fool had the best job in the world			1
these days , i ’m obsessed with politics — but i ’d have swapped my political job with his in a heartbeat			2
i was captivated not only by the @entity167 ’s music , but his story ; a combination of fairytale and tragedy , straight out of @entity172			0
dream : what @entity33 wanted more than anything was to visit @entity113 , @entity34 's home in @entity114 , @entity57 there was the dirt - poor boy who became rich beyond his wildest dreams ; the dangerous rebel who outraged the country , then joined the army ; the sex symbol who only had eyes for his mother			1
the divine @entity187 who became a fat wreck ; the good ole southern white boy who never uttered a racist word ; the anti-drugs campaigner hooked on prescription drugs ; the global superstar who barely left @entity116			0
over the years of my obsession , i built something close to an @entity34 shrine in my childhood bedroom			1
my holy relics included a green tin @entity119 road sign ; a 1987 black and gold baseball cap , commemorating the tenth anniversary of his death ; a @entity204 t - shirt ; and a copy of the outsize , gold - plated sunglasses worn by @entity34 in the studio when he recorded @entity209 , only a few weeks after his 1972 separation from his wife , @entity211			1
that , incidentally , was the song i chose to sing in @entity113 ’s recording booth , on my visit there in 1991			2
i have never worn the gold sunglasses ( in company , anyway ) and i wonder now why on earth i bought them — or , for that matter , the ceramic @entity223 pot pourri holder that dangled over my bedroom window for several years in the late @entity225			2
only the most extreme popular music obsessives go in for this sort of thing			0
the @entity167 : @entity50 performing on the @entity229 in june 1968 how many classical music enthusiasts own a @entity232 street sign commemorating the house where @entity234 died in 1897 ? can you buy @entity237 pot pourri holders at the @entity238 ? i ’ve stopped acquiring memorabilia			2
a decade ago , in the build - up to birthdays and @entity242 , i laid down a diktat to friends and family : ‘ no @entity34 - related presents , please			2
’ it was n’t that i had gone off him ; more i began to wonder why liking someone ’s voice meant you should want to own a pot pourri holder with his face on it			0
while my attitude to @entity34 changed over the years , he had n’t			2
through the years of my obsession , he ’d been lying dead in the @entity57 earth			0
( his coffin was moved from @entity256 in @entity114 to @entity113 two months after he died on august 16 , 1977 , to escape grave - robbing fans			1
) that ’s the funny thing about being a fan			0
once you ’ve fixated on your subject , whether it ’s a pop star , football player or @entity266 painter , they remain immutable , though as years slip by , you may fall in and out of love with them			0
i only really stopped being obsessed with him in the summer of 2005 , at the age of 33 , when i moved to @entity271 as the @entity273 correspondent for a @entity64 newspaper			0
familiarity with @entity116 — and a second visit to @entity113 — meant some of the glamour evaporated			1
in the words of @entity34 ’s old @entity114 friend , @entity167 , had the thrill gone ? obsession : @entity33 only really stopped being obsessed with @entity34 in the summer of 2005 , at the age of 33 , when he moved to @entity271 well , not entirely			1
i still get a residual buzz when i find that others share my affection for the @entity167			0
in a recent interview , @entity286 chose @entity34 as her pin - up because , as she put it , he ‘ always calls people “ sir ” and “ ma’am ”			2
sex appeal and manners — wow ! ’ i ’ve always liked @entity286 ; i like her even more now			0
these days , i do n’t read books by @entity34 ’s old hairdresser , as i once did , nor do i buy any more @entity34 - related goods			2
the @entity119 road sign is relegated to the bathroom			0
the pot pourri holder is no longer on public display — but it is in a drawer somewhere ; i could n’t bring myself to throw it away			0
middle age has swept away the tendency to obsession that crops up in lots of teenagers — whether for @entity309 , @entity311 figures or @entity312 stamps			0
the devotion to your chosen object is real enough at the time			0
but the fanaticism is also a safe refuge from the harrowing worries of adolescence , teenage shyness or a romantic void			0
in my case , middle age may not have killed off all my shyness or entirely filled that void , but it has mercifully smoothed away the extremes of my obsession			0
these days , @entity34 is only sometimes on my mind .			2

@entity33 became a fan of @entity50 when he was a teenager
he visited @entity113 , @entity34 's home in @entity114 during a *university* holiday
performed my way in the style of @entity34 after finishing exams at @entity10
among his audience was a fellow student : @entity21
