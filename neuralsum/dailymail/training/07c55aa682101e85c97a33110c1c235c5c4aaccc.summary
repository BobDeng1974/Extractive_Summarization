by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 has backed @entity2 to take @entity3 into @entity4 and apologised to fans for the early exit in @entity7 - but says that the team have to become more streetwise if they want to become a force in major tournaments			1
@entity1 supports the attacking style and introduction of young players that @entity2 has used in @entity7 , saying he believes the strategy will pay dividends in the future			1
key moment : @entity19 's @entity18 was fortunate to escape a second booking for foul on @entity22 with the score 0 - 0 on the run : @entity1 , second left , takes part in a practice drill during a training session on saturday focused : @entity1 walks past as manager @entity2 , left , talks with coach @entity29 during training but he also says @entity3 need to learn from the @entity31 and become less naive in the way they play the game			1
@entity1 said : ' if you look at teams who have won the tournament in previous years , you can see that nastiness in them			1
i think we need to get that in us			0
maybe we 're too honest			0
' @entity19 stopped the game ; they committed i do n't know how many fouls - clever fouls which slowed the game down			1
i think we 're a bit honest in terms of the way we play			1
' it 's small margins , but those small things can amount to a big thing in terms of staying in the competition or going out			1
' asked whether @entity22 might have made more of the elbow to this throat by @entity19 's @entity18 , who was already on a yellow card , during thursday 's 2 - 1 defeat , @entity1 said : ' of course			1
you see players surrounding the referees - i 'm not saying @entity19 did that - but i 'm the same now			1
i want to win the game			1
hurting : @entity1 admitted the players were disappointed by early @entity67 exit ' i got kicked 10 times and i do n't think there was a yellow card given to an opponent			1
that 's what i mean			1
we tend to get up and try to get on with the game as quick as we can			1
' maybe that 's a fault , maybe that 's where other teams are ahead of us			2
but we gave everything to try to win games			0
but there are a lot of young lads who want to play every minute			2
i think at times we could have slowed the game down a bit or taken control of the game a bit more			2
you have to take your chances			0
' despite the disappointment , @entity1 believes @entity2 was right to take a positive approach to games in @entity7			1
' if you look over the previous two or three tournaments , we 've not attacked teams , we 've been cautious , ' he said			0
' in other tournaments we 've wondered if we could have done things differently once we were out , but we 've had a go here			0
it 's just not gone our way			2
' @entity3 goalkeeper @entity105 admits it will be a long three weeks while the @entity67 goes on without @entity3			1
question time : @entity105 and @entity1 face the press at the @entity109 on saturday @entity2 's side still have to play @entity111 on tuesday but the @entity113 keeper says it will be tougher to take after the squad have travelled home and started their holidays			1
' it will be really difficult , ' said @entity105			0
' @entity118 will be everywhere , no matter where we are in the world , a reminder of where we could have been			0
' we 've no - one else to blame			0
we could have changed that , but we have n't			0
it 'll play on our minds , but we have to move on			2
' it 's the worst i have felt			2
i have a strange , empty feeling			0
i have put everything into this tournament but ultimately i 'm gutted			0
' @entity105 admitted that there are no easy explanations for the defeats against @entity135 and @entity19 - sides that @entity111 managed to beat			1
he said : ' it 's a good question			2
they 've been tough games for @entity111 and they 've come out on the right side			0
we 've had two tough games and come out on the wrong side			0
it 's a simple question but a tough one to answer			2
' heads up : @entity145 ( left ) and @entity146 during training on saturday difficult : @entity105 ( left ) admitted the @entity67 exit was the lowest moment of his career for @entity105 , whose @entity67 appeared to be in jeopardy when he was dropped by club manager @entity152 last year but who battled back to become @entity113 's no 1 and win the @entity156 title , said he and the squad would take lessons from @entity7			2
he said : ' i want to keep improving , trying to take the best of every situation , good and bad			0
' we 've had some high ones , some very good ones			0
but this was my first @entity67 playing , and it 's not gone to plan			0
but there are things i can take from it , technical and personal things			0
