by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 14:56 est , 16 october 2013 the christening service of the @entity3 and @entity4 of @entity6 's son , @entity5 , will take place at 3pm next wednesday , @entity1 confirmed today			1
the baptism will be held in the @entity9 at @entity10 and will last 45 minutes			1
it will , as previously revealed , be conducted by @entity12 , the most reverend @entity13			1
one of the reasons for a late afternoon ceremony is that the @entity16 is holding a reception at @entity18 earlier in the day for the @entity19			2
christening : @entity5 was born on july 22 and is third in line to the throne but royal aides say no further details about godparents and other guests or the order of service will be given out until the day			1
last week the @entity28 revealed that senior members of the @entity30 including the @entity31 and @entity32 have been left off the guest list			0
it is highly unlikely that prince @entity36 's uncles , prince @entity37 and @entity38 , will attend either			0
in a break with @entity42 tradition , the couple have chosen to hold an ' intimate ' ceremony at the @entity9 of @entity10 - where the body of @entity45 , lay before the altar for a week before her burial in 1997 so her family could pay their last respects			1
the archbishop of @entity52 said he was looking forward to welcoming @entity5 into the ' family of the church ' in a statement released two weeks ago the couple chose the venue over the @entity58 at @entity18 - where prince @entity36 , prince @entity59 , prince @entity37 and @entity32 were all baptised - and the private chapel of the royal residence , where the @entity16 herself was christened			1
it is understood that @entity36 and @entity63 favoured the @entity64 - decorated @entity9 because it is , in the words of one royal aide , ' an historic , quite intimate chapel			1
' ' it is something they have been thinking about for some time and they just very much liked personally , ' they said			0
the couple have long made clear they are n’t sticklers for royal convention : whether it be @entity36 ripping up the suggested 700 - strong guest for his wedding because he ' hardly knew anyone on it ' or their decision to release a family snapshot of @entity5 taken by @entity63 ’s father , @entity84 , instead of a formal portrait following his birth on july 22			1
and the couple have other personal links to @entity10 , where until recently their household was based			1
and in april 2011 , @entity63 chose the chapel to be formally confirmed into the @entity92 before her marriage to prince @entity36			0
the last official royal christening to take place at @entity10 was that of princess @entity96 in december 1988			1
it is likely that the @entity5 will be christened in a replica @entity99 lace gown of that worn by @entity16 @entity103 's eldest daughter in 1841			0
the original intricate lace and satin christening robe was specially crafted for @entity103 , the princess royal , and used by generation after generation of royal infants including @entity36 himself			1
prince @entity38 's daughter , @entity111 , was the last royal baby to wear the delicate ensemble in 2004			1
the @entity16 then commissioned an identical handmade copy so the 172 - year historic outfit could be carefully preserved			0
it was made by the @entity16 's dresser @entity116 and her team of dressmakers at @entity18			0
tearing up the rule book : the couple have long made clear they are n't sticklers for royal convention the @entity16 and @entity124 will attend wednesday 's christening along with the @entity59 , a grandfather for the first time , and the @entity4			1
@entity63 's family - parents @entity128 and @entity84 – will also be invited along with the godparents , about whom royal aides have promised more details on the day of the christening			1
in line with royal tradition , @entity5 is likely to have six god - parents and among the names in the frame are @entity36 's best friend @entity139 , his former private secretary @entity139 and ex-nanny @entity140			1
several of @entity63 's friends are also in the running , along with her sister , @entity144 , and brother @entity145			0
the christening will also allow a truly historic family photo to be taken – and released to the public - no doubt delighting the 87 - year - old @entity16			1
the @entity16 and @entity124 will attend wednesday 's christening of the third in line for the first time in more than a century , three heirs to the throne are alive : prince @entity59 , 64 , prince @entity36 , 31 and new - born @entity5			2
the last occasion such picture was taken was in 1894 when @entity16 @entity103 was photographed with her son @entity158 , grandson @entity159 and great grandson @entity158 the existence of a @entity9 itself dates back many centuries and , originally , was not a building but an establishment : a body of priests and singers to serve the spiritual needs of the @entity170			2
during @entity171 times the @entity9 would follow the @entity170 around the country to whichever @entity1 or great house was in favour at the time			2
since @entity176 burned down in the late 17th century the @entity177 has been based exclusively at @entity10			2
the building was originally constructed by @entity179 and decorated by @entity64 in honour of the king 's fourth marriage to @entity183			0
@entity185 's heart is buried beneath the choir - stalls and it was where @entity187 said her prayers for the defence of the realm against the threat of the @entity193 in 1588			0
at the end of the @entity196 , @entity194 also received the @entity197 in the @entity9 at @entity10 before his execution in @entity199 in 1649			1
three special coins will be made to mark the @entity5 's christening , the @entity200 has announced			0
a gold kilo coin , a silver £ 5 coin and a ' more affordable ' £ 5 coin have been approved by the @entity3 and @entity63 , the @entity16 and the chancellor			0
birthday money : this £ 5 coin was previously issued by the @entity200 to mark the birth of the royal baby this will be the first time that new coins have been produced in the @entity215 to mark the christening of a member of the @entity30			1
details of the prices and how many will be created have yet to be announced			0
@entity221 , of the @entity200 , said : ' the @entity200 has celebrated moments of national significance for over 1,000 years and it was felt appropriate to produce the first - ever set of @entity42 christening coins to mark the christening of our future king			2
' as a @entity215 institution , the @entity200 has played a central role creating works of art as official commemorations of landmarks in the history of the @entity30 for hundreds of years			0
these coins will be a fitting addition to that long tradition			0
' a £ 5 silver proof coin has already been issued to mark the birth of the future heir to the throne and other commonwealth countries including @entity243 and @entity244 have also issued coins to commemorate the birth			0
the £ 5 @entity30 coin was priced at £ 80 from the @entity200 , and is currently sold out			0
queen @entity103 was married in the @entity9 , and her marriage certificate , hand - written by the archbishop of @entity52 and signed by both bride and groom , still hangs on the wall in the vestry			1
it is also considered to be the cradle of @entity257 church music			0
among its many noted organists and composers was @entity261			0
one of the @entity9 's most notable organists and composers was @entity264 , who was appointed by @entity265 in 1723 as ' composer of @entity267 's @entity42 '			2
the title was constructed to allow @entity264 , still a @entity269 citizen , to contribute to the musical development of the @entity9 without actually being a member of it			2
though @entity5 is the first member of the royal family to be christened in the @entity9 for 25 years , it has been the backdrop for many royal milestones since its construction in the 16th century			1
built by @entity179 following his short - lived fourth marriage to @entity183 , the chapel at @entity10 is the believed burial site of @entity185 's heart			1
it is where @entity187 chose to remain during the @entity193 in 1588 to pray , receiving updates of the conflict 's progress via fire beacon from @entity289			0
the @entity9 at @entity10 has been the scene of many royal milestones since its construction under the order of @entity179 in 1540 @entity294 within the @entity9 where @entity5 will be christened on wednesday queen @entity103 married @entity295 at the @entity9 in 1840 underneath its decorated ceiling which is painted with royal initials and coats of arms			1
her marriage certificate , handwritten by the archbishop of @entity52 and signed both by the bride and groom still hangs in the @entity9 's vestry			1
in 1997 , the coffin of @entity45 lay before the chapel 's altar ahead of her funeral in @entity310			0
at the end of the @entity196 , @entity194 received the @entity197 within the chapel 's walls before his execution in @entity199 in 1649			0
@entity3 and @entity315 leaving the @entity9 with princess @entity96 after her christening in 1988 various changes were made to the building in 1836 with the addition of side galleries and a new ceiling to match the original 1540 ciphers			1
the @entity9 also has a long musical history with many noted organists and composers having performed there			2
queen @entity103 and @entity295 were married in the @entity9 in 1840			2
their marriage certificate still hangs in the chapel 's vestry among the most well known are @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 and @entity261 who lived in a suite of apartments within the @entity10			1
it is believed the poet , @entity336 , who was frequently in debt , used to take refuge with @entity261 in his apartments in order to avoid the clutches of persistent creditors			0
one of the @entity9 's most notable organists and composers was @entity264 , who was appointed by @entity265 as ' composer of @entity267 of his majesty 's @entity42 ' in 1723			2
the title was constructed to allow @entity264 , still a @entity269 citizen , to contribute to the musical development of the @entity9 without actually being a member of it			2
@entity264 composed the great anthem ' @entity350 ' for the coronation of @entity265 in 1727			0
the song has been used at every coronation since			0
and is also sung at the @entity355 service in which the @entity16 distributes @entity355 money to elderly members of the church on the day before @entity359			0
the nearby @entity9 was built by @entity360 for the @entity362 bride of his son , later @entity194 , and designed by @entity364 .			2

45 - minute christening will take place at @entity9 , @entity10
archbishop of @entity52 @entity13 , will perform the ceremony
couple say choice of *location* was a ' very personal ' decision
