now the slim teenager has followed that rule to the letter - and left her life of grime and poverty to become a leading ballerina who performs in glistening opera houses across the world			1
miss @entity2 grew up on the @entity21 ghetto , on the outskirts of the @entity24 capital , before she was discovered at the age of ten by a ballet school - and prepared for a life on stage			1

the 14 - year - old @entity2 ’s unlikely success is as much a celebration of a unique effort by the @entity24 ’ most famous prima ballerina , @entity55 , to help slum kids of @entity7 by providing them a scholarship and classical ballet training for six to seven years			1
from slum dweller to ballet scholar : @entity2 makes around 7,000 pesos ( $ 170 ) a month , or sometimes double that amount , from stipend and performance fees cramped conditions : @entity2 grew up on the @entity21 slum , @entity7 , pictured above left , selling rubbish with her father			1

talented : slum - dweller @entity2 auditioned for the ballet scholarship at the age of ten and is now one of the country 's brightest young stars ' i used to tag along with my father and mother when they collected garbage in the evening , ' @entity2 said in her home about the size of a shipping container with a small attic			1
her family would gather trash from houses in the nearby @entity118 district or rummage for scrap metal in the huge garbage dump not far from home			2
that was until her successful audition for the @entity125 dance scholarship established by @entity55 , founder and artistic director of @entity32 who is married to business tycoon @entity127			1
the outreach program of @entity32 — which runs a dance company and a school by the same name — initially accepted 40 students from @entity2 ’s charity - run school in @entity7 ’s @entity74 district dump site			1

sharing the space were frames of ballet certificates and a newspaper clipping about the garbage picker - turned - ballerina			1
