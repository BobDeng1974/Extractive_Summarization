by @entity0 just a few years ago , finding an @entity2 football fan openly supporting the @entity4 team would have been almost unheard of			2
so it is perhaps surprising that , during the @entity9 final , @entity7 fans will be flocking to support the old rival @entity11 against a newer rival in @entity13			1
sir @entity14 , @entity2 's hat - trick hero of 1966 , has already pledged his support , as has @entity18 prime minister @entity17 , as @entity11 's stylish football and impressive attitude has won the country over			1
in a final between two old enemies of @entity7 football , @entity7 fans seem to be backing old rivals @entity11 over newer adversaries @entity13 champions elect : the @entity4 played some scintillating football to beat hosts @entity30 in the semi-final together : the @entity4 performances and team spirit has drawn support from @entity7 fans @entity14 told the @entity35 on sunday : ' i know @entity2 supporters will be shocked to see me backing the @entity4 but they are the tournament 's best team			1
' they are a great football nation - very much like us in that they are determined , strong and proud			0
' while the @entity45 are capable of playing with flair and style , particularly when @entity44 performs , the @entity4 have been excellent in @entity30 , particularly in their semi-final annihilation of the hosts			0
@entity17 is also lending his support to our @entity52 neighbours , though it has been suggested that this in only to curry favour with chancellor @entity55			0
mr @entity17 was rooting for @entity56 to beat @entity57 in wednesday 's crunch semi final and had been texting the country 's prime minister @entity59 ' furiously '			2
but after the @entity61 crashed out on penalties mr @entity17 has turned his support to the @entity4			2
@entity2 's hat - trick hero @entity14 ( left , holding captain @entity64 ) , who helped @entity2 to victory over the @entity4 in 1966 has come out in support of the @entity52 team over the @entity69 seventh heaven : the @entity4 's 7 - 1 thrashing of @entity30 sees them go into the final as favourites @entity2 and @entity11 have plenty of history , both on and off the field			1
@entity78 's side beat the @entity4 4 - 2 in 1966 to win the @entity9 , thanks to two controversial goals from @entity14 - one which hit the bar and bounced over the line , and another at the end of extra time as fans were streaming on to the pitch			1
it was @entity11 who knocked @entity2 out of the last @entity9 , beating @entity91 's side 4 - 1 in 2010 , inflicting @entity2 's heaviest @entity9 defeat thanks in part to a disallowed goal from @entity95			2
of course , in terms of real - world rivalries , the two @entity96 are what made @entity11 into the enemy in the first place			0
for @entity4 fans , a win tomorrow would put an end to their status as perennial nearly - men , making the semi finals or finals of the last four @entity109 without a win if @entity13 were to emerge victorious it would mark the third @entity9 win in the country 's history meanwhile , on the @entity45 side , the @entity115 and the still - bitter argument over the islands has done nothing to endear @entity7 minds to the prospect of an @entity45 win			1
on the pitch , @entity124 's ' hand of @entity126 ' moment , when he scored against @entity2 from an unpenalised handball in 1986 , still sticks in the memory , as does the memory of @entity131 hitting the turf after being tapped on the leg by @entity134 in 1998			0
given the animosity that most @entity2 supporters feel towards the two nations , it is almost a shame that they can not both lose			0
but when it comes to picking a winner , it seems that the @entity7 are choosing to back the @entity52 over the @entity69 .			0

@entity11 and @entity13 meet in @entity9 final on sunday night
@entity2 has *fraught* *relations* with both nations - on and off the pitch
however it seems that @entity2 fans are backing the @entity4
@entity9 winner @entity14 and *pm* @entity17 leading the way
