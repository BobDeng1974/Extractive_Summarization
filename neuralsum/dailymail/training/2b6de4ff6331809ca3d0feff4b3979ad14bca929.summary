by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 10:55 est , 5 december 2012 it might look like a winter wonderland but this image is actually a microscopic close - up - inside a human intestine			2
every year the @entity6 challenges researchers to create ' labstract art ' to make their work more accessible to the public			1
and one of the winning creations was this impression of the intestinal wall which has an uncanny resemblance for a number of @entity18 trees			2
the image was created by dr @entity25 and @entity22 from the @entity26			1
dr @entity21 said : ' the image is of cells that make up intestinal tissue			1
' the organised crypt - villus structures in the image reminded me of @entity18 trees			0
' when i heard about the competition i remembered the image we had captured during our research so i quickly decorated the trees with snow and baubles using @entity37 software as a bit of fun			1
' he named it ' @entity42 ' after the ' wnt pathway ' proteins he is studying			0
dr @entity21 , who created the image using a confocal microscope and green dye			1
the image , generated using a confocal microscope to study intestinal tissue , was one of 12 winning entries into the art of @entity54			1
dr @entity21 works in the @entity56 colorectal tumour biology laboratory at the university			0
he added : ' it shows that although we scientists are very serious about our research and committed to understanding cancer , we also have a sense of humour - and are normal humans beings			2
' there were more than entries in the competition with the 12 winning shots ranging from abstract - like images of fluorescent tissue cells to a heart - shaped cervical lymph node and an invasion of cancer cells			0
@entity75 , a researcher from the @entity6 's @entity76 and co-ordinator of the competition , said : ' the high quality found in the images received this year highlights how scientists are not the stereotypical eccentrics in white coats , but in fact highly creative and artistic			0
' the aesthetic beauty that the researchers have found within their work , taken whilst studying medical problems that affect us all , such as cancer and arthritis , is something that we hope everyone can relate to			0
