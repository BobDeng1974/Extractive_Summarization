@entity10 doubled @entity4 's lead in the 12th minute at the @entity12 with a cute finish from a tight angle , after @entity15 had profited from some poor goalkeeping minutes to put @entity7 's team ahead minutes before			2
@entity19 international @entity18 hit back for the @entity21 hosts just before the break , but it was @entity4 that dominated the game in @entity25 and should have perhaps won by more			1

they made the perfect start at the @entity12 as @entity15 and @entity2 struck inside 13 minutes to put them two goals ahead			0
@entity15 made the most of some woeful goalkeeping by @entity5 's @entity29 to smash home the opener , before @entity2 netted on his first start for the club when he reacted quickest to score from a tight angle after @entity66 's effort had been kept out			2
@entity64 shone alongside @entity66 in an attacking role for the visitors , though he will be frustrated not to have troubled the scorers after passing up two decent chances			0
@entity51 pulled off a fine stop to keep out @entity18 's penalty towards the end of the half , but he could do nothing about the striker 's sweeping finish from 20 yards six minutes before the interval			1
opening the scoring : @entity15 had earlier put @entity4 ahead after pouncing on a @entity29 error @entity107 display : @entity64 played well but should have scored for @entity7 's side at the @entity12 in the second half @entity64 wasted another glorious chance to score while @entity53 failed to beat @entity29 with two attempts after finding himself rather uncharacteristically inside the opponents ' penalty area			0
@entity58 , who replaced the goalscorer @entity15 with half an hour to play , was the final @entity4 culprit as he blazed off target from a promising position .			0

@entity15 opened the scoring on six minutes and @entity2 , a *summer* *signing* from @entity121 , doubled their lead *shortly* after
@entity19 striker @entity18 pulled one back for @entity5 but not before he had a penalty saved by *evergreen* goalkeeper @entity51
@entity4 end pre-season , which *included* four *friendlies* and two @entity131 *qualifiers* , without having lost a game
they start their @entity77 campaign against @entity78 on *august* *16*
