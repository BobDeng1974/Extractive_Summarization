by @entity0 exposing nuclear reactors to the elements might not seem like the best idea			1
but a team of engineers have revealed how their design to place nuclear reactors in water could save lives			1
these plants would use the surrounding water to safeguard themselves in the event of a natural disaster that could cause a meltdown			1
the greatest danger is actually the after - effects – failing to cool down a reactor core can be deadly			2
with that in mind , a team of engineers from the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) have unveiled their designs to place nuclear reactors at sea , where there is an abundance of cooling water for such situations			1
the idea is due to be presented at a symposium held by the @entity46 this week			0
@entity23 professors @entity20 , @entity48 , @entity49 and others will present the proposal			0
they argue that placing nuclear reactors at sea makes sense , and could save lives			2
‘ the biggest selling point is the enhanced safety , ’ @entity20 says in a release from @entity23			0
‘ it ’s very close to the ocean , which is essentially an infinite heat sink , so it ’s possible to do cooling passively , with no intervention , ’ he says			2
in the design , a floating platform containing the nuclear plant would be located several miles offshore			1
it would be moored in about 330 feet ( 100 metres ) of water			2
this would make it unaffected by tsunamis , and earthquakes would also have no direct effect			1
one of the issues that faced nuclear plants in emergency conditions , such as at @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , was overheating during meltdown			1
this would be almost impossible at sea , according to @entity82			0
‘ the reactor containment itself is essentially underwater			0
the concept of a floating nuclear plant is not in itself unique , as @entity87 is building one now barged off shore			0
this would be the first , however , far enough away to be able to ride out a tsunami			0
another advantage is that building nuclear plants on land can be expensive			2
they need to be located near water , which can make construction costly and difficult			1
as @entity99 points out , however , ‘ the ocean is inexpensive real estate			2
’ decommissioning would also be easier – at the end of it ’s lifetime the plant could be towed to a central facility , much like modern @entity106 ships carrying reactors are			0
a cutaway view of the proposed plant shows that the reactor is located deep underwater , with its containment vessel surrounded by a compartment flooded with seawater , allowing for cooling even in an accident the concept is flexible , so the reactors could range from small to big ; 50 - megawatt plants to 1,000 - megawatt plants			1
these sea - faring plants would probably find their greatest marked in @entity120 , where regions have high tsunami risks in addition to increasing power demands			1
‘ i think this is technically very feasible , ’ says @entity125 , a professor at the @entity126 at the @entity127			0
‘ of course , further study is needed to realise the concept , but the authors have the answers to each question and the answers are realistic			0
’ when exactly we could see floating nuclear reactors like this is not known , but it could be a very attractive design proposal in years to come .			0

a team of engineers has revealed their plans for ocean - based reactors
the plants would be several miles offshore and would use water as coolant
this could make the reactors *resistant* to earthquakes and tsunamis
water could be used to *prevent* the plants overheating in an emergency
*future* disasters comparable to @entity77 could be *prevent*ed
