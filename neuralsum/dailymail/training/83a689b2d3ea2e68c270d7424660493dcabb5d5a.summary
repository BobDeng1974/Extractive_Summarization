by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 19:02 est , 21 september 2013 rising up : @entity6 , pictured after visiting her grandson @entity1 for the first time at @entity4 in @entity5 , has long been seen to have aristocratic aspirations the agonies of how to design a new family coat of arms is one no doubt familiar to every aspirational family			0
so it can come as no surprise that faced with such a challenge the astute former air stewardess @entity15 - mother of the @entity16 - sought the advice of those valued by other great @entity20 families - even those that do n't actually exist			2
@entity22 has been revealed as the unlikely source of inspiration as the socially mobile mrs @entity15 set out to design her family crest in the run up to the 2011 royal wedding			1
the family even went to @entity29 , the set for @entity32 's award winning period drama , to meet etiquette expert historian @entity34 who advises the show on social protocol			2
they were so delighted by the royal equerry 's knowledge they asked him for help with the design of their own crest which was later used to adorn the programme at the @entity47 in april 2011			0
mr @entity34 , 53 , is an expert on protocol and advises the actors and production team on the set of the show to make sure every aspect of every scene is historically accurate			2
affectionately nicknamed the @entity54 he has been known to stop filming because he spotted that the ' wrong ' shoebrush was being used to shine some boots and is often found pacing the length of the @entity22 dining room adjusting cutlery and pleading with actors to keep their hands off the table			2
a source told @entity64 : ' @entity34 is also a @entity65 , so he has a lot of experience			2
' but i 'm sure people will be amused to know the @entity70 looked to @entity22 for help in coming up with the coat of arms			1
' although as a royal bride @entity16 would have been entitled to apply for a heraldic design in her own right , it was decided that her parents would commission one			1
how it might have been : had she been without the help of her aristocratic advisors this is how the @entity15 crest might have turned out a high - class line - up : the cast of the popular show @entity22 painstaking process : after much discussion about the design @entity90 @entity89 , sketches the @entity91 for the @entity15 family @entity91 came into being during medieval tournaments like jousting when knights would be recognised by the motifs on their shields or helmets and heralds quickly learnt the different ones in use , taking up responsibility for the control of their @entity105 time their use began to decline in competition and battle but they became more widely used in @entity111 , a branch of the royal household , is the official body in the @entity20 that deals with coats of arms and their team of experts - funded by the fees they charge and not taxpayers money - design and research heraldic or genealogical @entity122 arms are given for free while the money people pay is for the research and design of the coat of @entity128 , that does n't mean that just anybody can pay the fee and get a coat of arms			1
the cumulative knowledge of the @entity133 gathered over hundreds of years has given them the skill of tactfully suggesting that people do n't proceed with their @entity138 late @entity137 , a former @entity139 , once said : ' in practice , eligibility depends upon holding a civil or military commission , a sound university degree or professional qualification , or having achieved some measure of distinction in a field beneficial to society as a whole			0
' this gives his entire family – including their other children , @entity155 , 30 , and @entity156 , 26 , the right to use the emblem			1
they met with mr @entity34 and his colleague @entity160 the @entity161 and @entity162 to invent their crest			0
together they settled on a simple design , with three leafy acorns representing each of the couple ’s three children – an idea suggested by @entity16 herself			1
acorns were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks			0
@entity175 is also a symbol of @entity177 and strength , and @entity179 , where the children were brought up , has many oak trees			0
most eye - catching is the gold chevron in the centre of the design representing @entity16 ’s mother , @entity6 , at the heart of her family with the colour a subtle reference to her maiden name , @entity194			1
the two thin white chevronels on either side allude to mountains and the family ’s love of skiing and outdoor pursuits			0
the background colours of red and blue were chosen as they are the principle colours from the flag of the @entity20 and match prince @entity207 ’s recently revised coat of arms			0
the @entity111 also likes to include a pun wherever possible and has made the two colours meet squarely in the centre as a play on the words ‘ middle tone ’			0
but while @entity16 's brother @entity156 will be able to pass down the coat of arms to his children @entity155 , as a woman , will not and can only use it during her lifetime			1
yesterday a spokesman for @entity22 confirmed : ' @entity34 worked with the @entity139 on developing the @entity15 crest			1
' royal wedding programme : prince @entity207 's coat of arms was printed on the front while @entity16 's , designed in complimentary colours , decorated the back			0

@entity22 adviser @entity34 helped @entity70 come up with the design
@entity230 features three acorns which represent @entity16 , @entity155 and @entity156 and their *upbringing* in @entity233
