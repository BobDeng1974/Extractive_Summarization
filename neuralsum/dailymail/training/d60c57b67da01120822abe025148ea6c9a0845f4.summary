patients may one day be able to carry out life - saving heart tests at home - using just a webcam			1
a new procedure , which includes a 15 - second face scan , is being developed which is capable of detecting tiny changes in skin colour			1
data gathered from the scan will help doctors determine whether patients are suffering from an irregular heartbeat			2
scientists have a new test so that atrial fibrillation , one of the most common heart rhythm problems , can be diagnosed with just a 15 second face scan rather than hooking the patient up to an electrocardiogram machine with the help of a webcam and new software , the new 15 - second test can detect atrial fibrillation ( @entity26 ) , a treatable but potentially dangerous heart condition characterised by irregular heartbeat			1
the technology records the subtle changes in skin colour which occur due to uneven blood flow caused by @entity26 these changes are so slight that they are invisible to the naked eye			1
however the skin on the face is thinner than other parts of the body and blood vessels are closer to the surface , so this is the ideal place to detect @entity26 , say the researchers			0
@entity26 is one of the most common heart rhythm problems , and affects up to 800,000 people in the @entity44			0
it significantly raises the risk of stroke , because it means the upper chambers of the heart do not pump efficiently , potentially causing blood clots			2
a normal heart rate should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute when at rest			0
but in atrial fibrillation , the heart rate may be over 140 beats a minute			1
in extreme cases , the condition can cause heart failure and has also been linked to @entity60 's disease by reducing blood flow to the brain			1
the technology was developed by the @entity64 and @entity65 in conjunction with @entity67			0
dr @entity68 , of @entity69 , in the @entity70 , said the new technology means @entity26 can be diagnosed without hooking the patient up to an electrocardiogram ( @entity74 ) machine , as is currently necessary			1
he said : ‘ this technology holds the potential to identify and diagnose cardiac disease using contactless video monitoring			2
' a normal heart rate should be between 60 and 100 beats a minute when at rest			0
in atrial fibrillation , the heart rate may be over 140 beats a minute he added : ‘ this is a very simple concept , but one that could enable more people with atrial fibrillation to get the care the care they need			1
’ the technology works because sensors in digital cameras record the different wavelengths of light : red , green , and blue			0
haemoglobin - a component of blood – ‘ absorbs ’ more of the green spectrum of light and this subtle change can be detected by the camera 's sensor			2
so the camera can detect the uneven blood flow caused by @entity26 by detecting higher levels of haemoglobin			0
scientists were able to verify the technology was working accurately by simultaneously hooking patients up to an electrocardiogram ( @entity74 ) so results from the facial scan could be compared to the actual electrical activity of the heart			1
the study , which was published online in the journal @entity119 , found that the colour changes detected by video monitoring corresponded with an individual 's heart rate as detected on an ecg			2
the study found that the video monitoring technique - which researchers have dubbed ‘ videoplethymography ’ - had an error rate of 20 per cent , compared with the 17 to 29 per cent error rate associated with automated @entity74 measurements			0
researchers are now in the process of evaluating the technology on a larger study population , including those without atrial fibrillation			1
however dr @entity68 said that the technology could be developed to be more accurate and accessible			0
he said : ‘ this study was intended to be a proof of concept and , as is the case with many new technologies , we believe that we can significantly improve its accuracy and the usability			0

patients may soon be able to carry out *lifesaving* heart tests using webcam
a 15 - second scan is capable of detecting tiny changes in facial skin colour
could be used to diagnose atrial fibrillation , characterised by irregular heartbeats
condition can lead to stroke , heart failure and even @entity60 's disease
until now it has been diagnosed by hooking patient up to a machine
