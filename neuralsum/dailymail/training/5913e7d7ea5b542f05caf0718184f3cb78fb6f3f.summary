@entity0 are considering a move for @entity3 midfielder @entity2			1
the @entity5 champions are rebuilding their squad this summer and @entity2 , who is one of those players @entity8 is prepared to discard at @entity9 , has emerged as a target for @entity0 manager @entity11			1
@entity2 , 25 , is viewed by @entity0 as an alternative to @entity14 's @entity13			1
@entity28 has already outlined his belief that the @entity3 squad is excessively stocked in @entity2 's preferred no. 10 position and it is understood that @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 all ahead of him in the pecking order			2
@entity2 has been frustrated by the failure of both sir @entity37 and @entity38 to hand him an extended run in his favoured role behind the forward and he has previously spoke of his reluctance to play from the wide positions			0
@entity38 , for his part , argued that @entity2 has been effective playing from the left for the @entity22 national team			0
in and out : the @entity22 international has struggled to nail down a place in the @entity3 first - team outgoing : @entity49 coach @entity11 is hoping to strengthen his depleted @entity5 side nonetheless , with @entity28 's new 3 - 5 - 2 system , the only slot for @entity2 would be in the role that @entity32 will primarily occupy , with @entity2 too slight to play in a wing - back role			1
@entity56 side @entity55 are also monitoring @entity2 and they have previously registered an interest in a player that could be available for around Â£ 13million			0
@entity23 are not currently prioritising a move to take @entity2 back to @entity56 but manager @entity61 remains an admirer and could be tempted into the race , particularly with the future of @entity65 remaining unclear			0
wanted : @entity11 is hoping to lure @entity13 ( right ) away from the @entity66			2

@entity0 are considering a bid for @entity2
@entity3 midfielder has struggled to fit in at @entity9
@entity11 on the lookout for an alternative to @entity14 's @entity13
