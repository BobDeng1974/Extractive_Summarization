by @entity0 published : 20:34 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 21:53 est , 22 january 2013 captain @entity1 : prince @entity5 races out from the @entity6 tent to scramble his @entity8 my ten - year - old son was delighted the other day to find a quotation from me appearing on the screen while he was playing the @entity14 game @entity15 : @entity16			1
but i was just bemused			1
ten years ago , in @entity25 , when i spoke the words ‘ it is a big step to take another human life			1
it is not to be done lightly ’ , i was preparing the men of my battle group to cross into @entity22 for the liberation with every expectation they would be doing exactly that : taking human lives			1
i never imagined that thought would feature in a computer game			1
so when i read yesterday of prince @entity5 using a striking phrase to describe killing @entity33 insurgents — he said the @entity36 would ‘ take them out of the game ’ — his words had a certain resonance for me			1
given that in the same interview @entity5 also talked about his love of @entity14 and @entity43 games , civilians could be forgiven for thinking that soldiers treat war as some sort of glorified game ; a boys ’ own adventure in which violent death is visited upon the enemy simply by pushing a button			1
so is killing on the battlefield really done with as little thought as when one blasts the bad guys in a computer game ? nothing could be further from the truth			1
no one knows better than captain @entity1 — who was in charge of the weapons systems on an @entity8 attack helicopter — that taking someone ‘ out of the game ’ means blasting them to smithereens			1
that is what happens to a person on the receiving end of a 30 - millimetre explosive bullet			1
checks : prince @entity5 wears his monocle gun sight as he sits in the front seat of his @entity79 cockpit soldiers who have served on the ground in @entity22 and @entity82 know what it is like to kill , to knowingly and purposefully take the life of another human being			1
they know what the consequence looks like , too			1
they do not take it lightly , not least because the chances are that they will have lost friends to enemy bullets			1
all trades have their lingo , and the @entity36 is no different			1
it just happens that one of the consequences of the military trade is death			1
it is no surprise that the terrible reality and absolute finality is cloaked in euphemisms			1
it is a psychological necessity			2
it protects the soldiers — allows them to get on with the job			2
nor is it a new phenomenon			2
the language changes , but the meaning is the same			2
in @entity115 , dead soldiers were said to have ‘ bought the farm ’ , or simply ‘ bought it ’			2
a serious life - changing wound was a ‘ blighty one ’ , meaning a trip home to the @entity120			2
in @entity124 , meanwhile , @entity123 soldiers would warn sentries heading out into @entity126 to be particularly careful where @entity128 snipers were known to lurk with a cautionary : ‘ stick your head up there and no more dinners			2
’ killing the @entity33 : prince @entity5 makes his early morning pre-flight checks at @entity135 in @entity82 in my service in the @entity139 , we would talk about a terrorist ‘ getting the good news ’ or ‘ rolling a seven ’			1
in the @entity142 , the slang tended to be more direct : a dead enemy had been ‘ slotted ’ or ‘ dropped ’			2
comments : @entity145 colonel @entity0 said prince @entity5 's words had a ' certain resonance ' for him when it comes to death and destruction , all soldiers need a way to talk about it without talking about it			1
fighters need to cast a glance at death , often on a daily basis , yet never look him in the eye			2
but it is not just the business of killing that is spoken of in a different language			2
all areas of army life have their jargon , and the @entity36 has always adopted terms from wherever it served			2
even when i joined in 1981 , long after the demise of the @entity173 , the language of the @entity36 was loaded with words in @entity175 and @entity176 left over from the days of the @entity177 : laundry was ‘ dhobi ’ ; tea was ‘ cha ’ ; a small wall was a ‘ bund ’ ; the toilet was the ‘ khazi ’			1
a look was a ‘ shufti ’ — from the @entity186			2
in the @entity139 , we would talk of going to one ’s ‘ basha ’ ( the @entity190 for ‘ house ’ ) , and the jungle was the ‘ ulu ’			0
this jargon serves a purpose			0
to know the lingo was a sign of achieving acceptance , and to be accepted means a soldier has a better chance of survival in combat because he must almost always rely on his colleagues			1
it is also a handy way of dealing with some horrible realities			0
i recall enquiring about one of my sergeants who had sustained terrible leg wounds from an improvised explosive device ( @entity212 )			0
i was told that it was likely that he would be ‘ excused boots ’			0
‘ excused saluting ’ with a left or right arm — or both — speaks for itself			0
it is the kind of black humour that has helped soldiers cope with the bloody reality of war for millennia			0
strength : an @entity8 ground crew member wears a t - shirt describing the firepower of the helicopter on the day we crossed into @entity22 , i had my sergeant major organise some @entity22 pows to bury one of their number killed in the fighting			0
tired and hungry , they did a bad job			0
the next day my own soldiers had to dig a proper grave to re ‑ bury the dead man because rigor mortis had made him bend forward and upwards and out of his very shallow grave to present something for the local dogs to gnaw on			0
my sergeant major explained that he had found him ‘ sitting up in bed ’ and our lads had made him ‘ more comfy ’			0
of course , in reality , the scene was one of horror , putrefaction and appalling stench			0
going for a walk : prince @entity5 at @entity135 , where he was serving as an @entity8 helicopter pilot and that is the point			1
you never talk about the business of warfare directly , or if you do , you do it very precisely			0
it is either slang and jargon , or the emotion - free military terms and language honed at @entity270			0
i recall in @entity272 how a would - be petrol bomber , having lit his device , tripped and ended up in flames of his own doing			0
‘ oh , he ’s put his blazer on , ’ quipped one soldier			1
the avoidance of stating the obvious is international , but it is the @entity120 above all who keep their emotions in check with euphemisms — sometimes to the frustration of our @entity289 colleagues , who do n’t always get it			0
this can have unintended consequences , as when brigadier @entity294 — commanding the @entity295 in @entity296 — was asked by a @entity289 general how things were going as his 600 soldiers were being attacked by a force of 30,000 @entity302 troops			0
@entity294 admitted to the @entity289 that ‘ things are a little sticky up here ’			0
the @entity289 general took that to mean ‘ not too bad ’ and so held back support			0
as a result , the @entity307 only escaped by a miracle and the @entity310 were over-run			0
even as i gave my eve - of - battle speech in @entity25 , i did so in a manner meant for the men			0
i did not refer to killing or being killed ; i talked of ‘ taking lives ’ , or ‘ not seeing the end of the campaign ’			0
the boys knew well enough what i meant			0
it is the same when prince @entity5 talks about taking @entity33 ‘ out of the game ’ — and let us not forget that this is exactly how all his comrades - in - arms talk			1
he knows too well what it means			0
he may joke that his @entity328 has honed his reflexes , but once again that is a soldier ’s flippancy disguising the deadly seriousness of his mission			1
for this is also a man who has looked down from his helicopter cockpit , identified enemy fighters running for their lives and witnessed the result when he has unleashed the awesome power at his fingertips .			0

@entity145 colonel @entity0 : @entity5 's words had a ' certain resonance '
' a soldier 's flippancy disguises the deadly seriousness of his mission '
