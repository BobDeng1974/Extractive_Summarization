by @entity1 reporter a couple of @entity4 sisters , aged 8 and 10 , have taken to @entity5 to lobby their state representative into reducing the minimum age on when kids can fire handguns			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , began taking his daughters @entity12 and @entity14 to the shooting range when they were five , but on a recent trip he was told a little known @entity4 law prevented children younger than 14 from using a handgun at all , even with parental supervision			1
outraged , he has contacted local and state officials to argue against the law , and the girls ' videos begging ' please let me use my .22 ' will be used by the @entity27 organization from today in its campaign to eliminate age restrictions for handgun use all together			1
' both girls claim that they love shooting their guns because it means they can spend time with their father			2
' it makes me feel sad because then i wo n't be able to spend time with my daddy , ' @entity14 told the @entity57 about the law			1
the law barring any handgun use by youths under 14 gained attention earlier this year when a @entity64 legislator tried to lower the legal age from 14 to 12 in a bid to allow more kids to safely practice shooting handguns			1
the bill failed to become law , however , because of the media coverage more gun ranges are enforcing the existing law and telling youngsters to leave , even if they 've been shooting at that range for years			1
angry : mr @entity10 , pictured , has contacted local and state officials to argue against the law fun : in a video now posted on @entity5 , the fourth - grader , shown here when she was six , says : ' it 's fun shooting my gun with my daddy , and i can learn how to safely handle it and protect myself and my family if needed to ' now : @entity12 , shown now , poses with her handgun and a wide smile in contrast , state law provides no minimum age for long guns , including mr @entity10 's @entity93 .308 deer - hunting rifle , and @entity12 points out this quirk in her bubbly video			1
under @entity4 law , ' i 'm unable to shoot my handgun , ' @entity12 says in the message to @entity101 state representative @entity100			1
@entity100 is the chairman of the @entity102			0
politician : the girls are lobbying rep. @entity100 , @entity105 , pictured she then , without looking at her handgun , locks the slide , ejects the magazine and sets the empty magazine on her family 's kitchen table before walking over to the .308 rifle			2
' i think we can both agree that this gun is way too big for me , ' she says			0
the rationale behind the difference in the laws is that long guns are used for hunting , and children should be able to hunt with supervision from a parent			2
but child psychiatrist @entity124 told the @entity57 that handguns should be treated differently because they 're about self - defense , not sport			2
she told the newspaper that teaching kids how to shoot handguns implies there might be an appropriate time for them to use the gun in a situation they consider dangerous , whether an adult is there or not			0
' we should teach them ways to solve conflicts that do n't involve guns , ' said @entity143			0
' and it 's really important for kids to have confidence that their world is safe and that the adults in their world are going to keep them safe			0
' @entity151 , the ceo at @entity152 , a @entity57 psychiatric medical institute for youths , said keeping unstable children away from guns was ' a good thing			0
' but she said she was undecided as far as the general youth population was concerned			0
fair : child psychiatrist @entity124 told the @entity57 that handguns should be treated differently from hunting guns because they 're about self - defense , not sport ' each kid is different in terms of their development and what they can and ca n't handle and the culture in a family and whether guns are part of that culture , ' @entity151 said			0
mr @entity10 said his girls are involved in other activities such as dance and basketball but shooting was a big part of their father - daughter time			1
and @entity27 ' executive director , @entity183 , told the @entity57 this was not only fun but a ' wise ' decision			2
' any father would be wise to show his daughter how to defend herself , ' he said			0
@entity183 is hoping the @entity10 sisters ' videos , which he plans to distribute widely , will help the organization get the guns back in the hands of children soon			1
' the real sad thing for us is more and more kids are now being kicked off gun ranges like the @entity10 kids , ' he told @entity57			2
' but it 's a simple fix			0
take out the age restriction			0

@entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity4 , began taking his daughters @entity12 and @entity14 to the shooting range when they were five
but on a recent trip he was told a little known @entity4 law prevented children younger than 14 from using a handgun at all , even with their parents there
outraged , he has contacted local and state officials to argue against the law
the girls have also made videos begging their state representative to ' please let me use my .22 '
the videos will be used by the @entity27 organization from today in its campaign to eliminate age restrictions for handgun use all together
