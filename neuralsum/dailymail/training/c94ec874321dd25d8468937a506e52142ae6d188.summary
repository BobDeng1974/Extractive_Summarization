@entity1 's third goal in five games handed @entity3 a 1 - 0 win over @entity5 and a place in the @entity8 fourth round			1
the @entity10 frontman endured a frustrating start to the season as he failed to score in any of his team 's first eight league games			0
but since breaking his @entity18 duck against @entity19 a fortnight ago , the former @entity16 striker has gradually resdicovered his scoring touch			0
@entity3 striker @entity1 scores his third in five games in their @entity8 win over @entity5 the 31 - year - old fired @entity3 ahead seconds before the half - time whistle and just moments after another strike had been ruled out for offside			1
the @entity29 record scorer 's confidence is still not at maximum levels , however - a fact highlighted by an easy miss right at the start of the second half which would have made life a lot easier for @entity38 's side as they had to dig deep to see out the win			1
@entity1 's goal sets up a meeting with @entity42 having gone 22 years without visiting the town of @entity5 , @entity3 were back beside the @entity44 for the second time in a week			1
@entity38 's men were comfortable 3 - 0 victors over the @entity47 last saturday as the sides met in the league			1
but it was the hosts who created the first opening of the third - round tie as @entity54 forced @entity55 ' stand - in keeper @entity56 - replacing @entity58 following his midweek collision with a post - into an early finger - tip save			0
@entity5 had been happy to have a go at their guests last week but having learned their lesson , boss @entity65 set up a five - man defensive guard at the back to protect against both the threat from out wide and through the middle			0
that left @entity3 to toil through their usual disjointed motions , with their only attempt in the first half an hour a wild swing from @entity74 which flew both high and wide			1
@entity75 came closer as he drove inside from his right - back slot to shoot but even then it was nowhere near to troubling @entity5 keeper @entity78			0
@entity3 lacked tempo , inventiveness and composure			1
they were just lucky the same could be said of their opponents			0
but eventually their quality began to shine through			0
@entity1 had the ball in the net four minutes before the break as he re-directed @entity75 's errant shot but saw it chalked off after wandering offside			2
@entity3 players celebrate what turned out to be the winner from @entity1 thankfully for the @entity95 giants , the striker 's next effort did count			1
@entity96 's through ball found @entity1 15 yards out and after sorting his feet out , he clipped the ball off the base of the post and into the net			2
his scoring touch remains fragile , though , and he made a complete mess of his next opening five minutes into the second period			0
there was nothing spectacular about @entity109 's long punt but it caught out the @entity5 defence as @entity1 darted through on @entity78			2
he only had the keeper to beat but put his finish straight at the keeper 's legs			0
@entity3 ' @entity115 ( left ) and @entity5 's @entity116 ( right ) compete for a head in their tight @entity8 clash @entity96 then fired into the side netting before seeing another effort saved easily by the keeper			1
@entity3 remained in control but the longer they went without adding to their lead , the more @entity5 believed they could grab something from the match			2
the @entity47 thought their moment had come as @entity126 got his head onto @entity129 's long free - kick but @entity56 proved again he was an able deputy in goal with another solid save			0
@entity131 went close with a 20 - yard strike 10 minutes before time as the away support held its breath			2
substitute @entity135 could have eased their fraying nerves but fired over from 10 yards out as @entity3 eventually clung on for victory .			1

@entity1 has three goals in his past five games after scoring on saturday
@entity1 struck before half - time and it was all @entity3 *needed* for victory
@entity3 will meet @entity42 in the next stage of the @entity8
