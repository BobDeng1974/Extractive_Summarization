chillingly life - like robots are causing a storm in @entity2 – where their creators are about to launch them as actresses , full - size mechanical copies for pop idol fans , and clones of the dearly departed			1
there is even talk that the naturalistic , even engaging , she - droids may be taken up as men as partners in the not - too - distant future			1
android @entity14 was a star attraction at @entity17 showcase earlier this month and she is one of a series of geminoids , as their inventor dubs them , that are ripe for commercialisation say their creator robotics professor @entity26			2
one man joked that @entity14 would make ' a good date ; a cheap date ! ' from others , covering their mouths in astonishment at @entity14 ’s realistic skin and facial expressions , the frequent response from the public was ' sukoi ' which translates as ' amazing ' in @entity57			0
@entity14 is so convincing that many bowed respectfully before requesting politely to take her photo or join a selfie			0
unable , for now , to use some of the advanced artificial intelligence ( @entity62 ) , face and voice recognition systems that some @entity2 robots coming on the market now use , @entity14 relies on a camera rigged behind her that is relayed to a remote human controller to give her life			1
this so - called tele - presence enables @entity14 to come alive , taking on the operator ’s personality			1
a fully independent version of the geminoid is expected in 10 years using all the above technologies to make her virtually indistinguishable from humans says mr. @entity80 , ceo of @entity81 in @entity41 , the company working with prof. @entity26 to make @entity14 and her kind commercial			1
' we already have 20 year 's experience making androids in the lab. so in 10 years we will marry @entity62 and life like geminoids in perfection , ' he told @entity44			1
' we had been focusing on perfecting her skin , facial expressions , and so on , so for now @entity14 is really just a head			0
now we are working on her arms and torso to give very natural , fluid body language			0
' darling : @entity100 was the star attraction at @entity17 ’ week recently where visitors were floored by her future : a fully independent version of the geminoid is expected in 10 years to make her virtually indistinguishable from humans depending on developments in artificial intelligence everything about @entity14 ’s appearance has been painstakingly honed to make her more life - like			1
from the superior quality of her silicon skin to the secret animatronic muscles that move her eyes and drive her facial expressions			0
previous attempts by @entity26 's team had been dismissed as unconvincing and prone to what is known as the ' @entity33 syndrome '			1
this is a term coined by another @entity2 professor of robotics , @entity124			1
it describes the response of revulsion and creepiness when faced with something that looks almost , but somehow not quite , human			0
as robots become as dexterous as @entity14 at mimicking humanity , so the theory goes , the syndrome will erase itself			1
already @entity14 and other androids from @entity137 have had a taste of the limelight , appearing on stage and voicing actors lines using tele - presence			1
@entity144 's next performance will be in an opera to prove her credentials as a singer			0
an @entity26 geminoid is also appearing on stage in @entity151 now			0
' one application we have is to turn her into an international pop idol , ' says mr. @entity80			0
already @entity2 is in thrall to virtual idols such as @entity159 , who is basically a hologram that ' sings ' words and music created for her on a computer using ' vocaloid ' technology			1
her tunes often outsell those sung by her flesh and blood musical rivals in @entity2			1
@entity137 also hopes to tap into another big business in @entity2 - the popularity of fantasy figurines that appeal to @entity2 ’s legions of nerdy men or ' otaku '			1
most such dolls are just a few centimetres high and often represent an idol or a manga character often scantily clad			0
frenzy : fembots such as these are causing a storm in @entity2 at the moment because of recent breakthroughs in technology that have made them so life - like			1
however some work is still to go on artificial intelligence have a nice day : an ' @entity191 ' greets guests to @entity41 ’s @entity193 of @entity194 , making unnerving life - like eye contact as she converses while hooked to a tele - presence system as @entity137 is working with highly respected prof. @entity26 , mr. @entity80 says the company has ruled out producing androids that might be used for sex			1
but a spokesman working with @entity26 ’s lab says it is not a great leap of imagination to think similar robots , given the advancement in robotics and silicone skin technology , will be used for sex			2
' physical relations will be possible in general with such androids , ' said @entity216			2
' @entity217 for the sex industry are a definite possibly			0
some have even fallen in love with @entity26 ’s geminoids			0
so we ca n't rule those relationships out			0
' @entity2 already boasts the world ’s most advanced sex dolls from firms such as @entity227 or @entity228 based in @entity41			1
around £ 6,000 buys the very superior @entity231 ' dutch wife ' sex doll with extras such as movable eyes and flexible fingers and a skin texture its makers say is indistinguishable from the real thing			2
@entity238 was so impressed with their quality that she asked the @entity2 firm to make dolls in her own image			2
' it is not inconceivable , ' said an @entity228 spokesman , ' that we will be making android life partners in the near future			2
' @entity249 , author of @entity250 predicts that as robots become more sophisticated , growing numbers of adventurous humans will enter into intimate relationships with these intelligent robots			2
speaking at the @entity256 , held last week , he says that @entity62 will progress to the point where human - robot dating will be commonplace			2
' being loved by a robot ? ' @entity249 says			0
' it sounds a bit weird , but someday , for many , many people , being in love with a robot will be just as good as love with a human			0
' real - life loved ones can also be reproduced faithfully by cloning them to comfort the bereaved ' , mr @entity80 pointed out			1
these completely unnerving baby - like telenoids are designed to show the minimum required human - like expressions and are most popular at the museum because they straddle the creepy / acceptable barrier @entity278 : hyper - real sex dolls are already on sale in @entity2			1
experts say it wo n't be long before android versions of them will be manufactured androids can now also take on a variety of human jobs such as receptionist and even news readers			2
to prove the point two fem - bots from @entity26 ’s stable have been working in those posts since june this year at @entity41 ’s @entity193 of @entity194			2
the more mature ' @entity191 ' greets guests to the museum , making terrifying life - like eye contact as she converses while hooked to a tele - presence system that the public can also play with			1
' @entity298 ' ( child android ) is viewable at the museum through an art like installation in an all white room where she sits without rest all day lip - synching the day ’s news perfectly from an @entity62 source			0
they are joined by the most compelling / repelling android of them all who incidentally happens to be the most popular among the @entity26 droids on show			0
the thoroughly unnerving baby - like @entity313 , sports a simplistic mannequin head with stunted arms and legs that also speaks by proxy from a control box maned by museum visitors			0
confronted with the rather formal reception - droid , @entity2 housewife @entity321 says she could n’t decide if @entity323 was human or not			1
' if you have talk to her getting closer is a good idea , so she seems more natural and less creepy close up , ' she said			0
' but it ’s great fun robo - chatting			0
' asked if she would like @entity323 at home as a baby sitter if mum was out			0
@entity334 replied : ' no , @entity335 is my robot ! '			0

*incredibly* life - like robots are currently causing a storm in @entity2 where they are being prepared for mass commercialisation
with new androids creators have beaten ' @entity33 syndrome ' where humans are revulsed by robots that look real - but not real enough
now being put to use as receptionists and *newsreaders*
predicted that within a decade fully independent ' *gemanoids* ' will be in *circulation* once advances in artificial intelligence are made
*scientists* even talking about humans taking androids as partners
