ahead of the final , we bring you everything you need to know			2
@entity0 striker @entity24 starred in his side 's emphatic 4 - 0 semi-final win over @entity14 on friday @entity24 has scored 11 @entity6 games during @entity0 's route to the final in @entity10 , @entity11 remind me , what is the @entity6 ? in a nutshell , it 's the @entity33 - but for under 19 teams			1
in its second season , the @entity6 was created by @entity6 to enable up - and - coming players in @entity38 's leading academies to gain valuable experience of playing in continental competition			1
the group phase runs in parallel with its big brother , with the same 32 teams as in the @entity33 matched in the same groups			0
the main difference is that the knockout rounds are single - legged and the semi-finals and final in the same place over the course of one weekend			2
so , where is that ? monday 's final will be played at the @entity52 , which is situated in the shadow of @entity6 's headquarters in @entity10 , @entity11			1
it 's a pleasant spot , overlooking @entity56 , and is the home of @entity58 , who play in the @entity61 third tier			2
it 's capacity is 7,200 and pretty big crowds were there enjoying the sunshine and the football in friday 's semi-finals			0
when is the game and @entity69 i watch it ? it will kick - off at 3pm @entity74 time and the match is live on @entity76			0
who won the @entity78 ? the maiden winners of the @entity6 were @entity80 , who defeated @entity82 3 - 0 in a one - sided final			1
the goals came from @entity85 and a double from @entity87 , the competition 's top goalscorer with 11 and now a member of the first - team squad			1
there was no @entity94 representation in the last four , though both @entity0 and @entity95 had made it to the quarter - finals			1
how have the @entity74 clubs done this year ? @entity0 , obviously , have made it all the way			1
@entity95 went out to @entity14 in the last eight , while both @entity101 and @entity102 tumbled out at the last 16 stage			0
@entity101 lost 1 - 0 to @entity104 and @entity102 were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity82			0
all hopes with @entity106 ? yes , and they will enter monday 's match as the marginal favourites			0
it is well - established that the @entity112 academy is one of the best in @entity114 and last season saw the under 21 team claim the @entity118 title and the @entity119 win the @entity120			2
they will take on @entity95 in this season 's @entity120 final , too , over the next couple of weeks , their fifth final in six seasons			2
having missed out on the @entity129 title to @entity130 two years ago , this is an excellent opportunity to assert their claim as one of @entity38 's best academies too			0
@entity0 's @entity135 ( left ) tussle for the ball with @entity14 's @entity138 ( right ) in the box who have they beaten to get this far ? the @entity142 made a statement of intent in the group phase , winning five of their six matches and racking up 24 goals in the process			1
@entity151 @entity150 were beaten 2 - 0 at home and 7 - 0 away , while @entity153 suffered 5 - 0 and 6 - 0 drubbings			0
@entity155 , who knocked @entity0 out last season , were beaten 4 - 1 before managing to win 2 - 0 at home			1
@entity0 then overcame @entity158 @entity157 3 - 1 in the last 16 courtesy of goals from @entity24 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
@entity104 were then seen off 2 - 0 at @entity163 in the quarters , with an own goal and another from @entity24 securing their passage to @entity11			2
but their most impressive performance came in the semi-final with @entity14 on friday as a flurry of second - half goals from @entity162 , @entity24 ( 2 ) and @entity172 left @entity14 in ruins			2
@entity0 's @entity174 ( right ) and @entity14 's @entity175 ( left ) battle for the ball on monday what are they saying ? coach @entity8 was effusive about his team 's qualities after their drubbing of @entity14 , telling @entity38 : ' i 'm very proud â€“ proud of the players , proud of the staff who have worked very hard to get to this stage			1
