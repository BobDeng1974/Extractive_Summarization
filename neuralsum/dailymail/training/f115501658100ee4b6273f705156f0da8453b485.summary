when it comes to designing handbags , @entity0 is constantly on a quest to find beauty in the banal			0
last season saw the @entity7 accessories designer transform her @entity9 catwalk - turned - conveyor - belt into supermarket sweep with dancing salesmen , glamorous lady shoppers pushing trollies and all the usual household essentials transformed into handbags			1
@entity0 's @entity17 totes , which came emblazoned with washing detergent and cereal packaging became the season 's must - have arm candy			1
so what has she got lined up for @entity24 ? @entity25 goes fun ! @entity0 , one of @entity7 's most esteemed accessory designers , unveiled her @entity29 handbag collection at @entity9 today always one to put the fun into the last day of @entity33 fashion week , @entity0 's catwalk was modelled on a fairground , complete with skeletons , giant teacups and , of course , handbags			2
her totes were as bright as her catwalk and , perhaps in a nod to back to school season , came emblazoned with customisable stickers			2
fun at the fair : always one to put the fun into the last day of @entity33 fashion week , @entity0 's catwalk was modelled on a fairground back to school : her new season totes came emblazoned with customisable stickers and quirky slogans the perfect rave accessory ? lots of her handbags , which came in neon colours such as orange and yellow , which glowed the dark the sticker bags for grown - ups were plastered with giant pencils , rainbows and slogans such as ' bags have feelings too '			1
it 's these quirky details that really define @entity0 as a designer			2
proving to be the perfect rave companion , most of her handbags are glow in the dark and come with huge chandelier tassels and paint splatters			0
discussing the inspiration behind her designs , @entity0 said : ' @entity24 was inspired by the idea of taking stickers that were my schoolgirl version of " personalisation " but making them beautifully and handcrafted in leather			0
my idea was that you can " sticker up " your handbag or phone or notebook and make it into your own personal artwork or buy bags that already have sticker designs worked into the leather			1
' i love the combination of a grown up snakeskin handbag smothered in leather stickers			2
' watched from the front row by super-fan @entity95 , as well as @entity97 and @entity98 , @entity0 's colourful show had @entity101 abuzz			1
a fun end to fashion week : as @entity9 draws to a close today , @entity0 was clearly keen to have some fun on the runway famous fans : @entity0 's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in @entity109 , @entity110 and her handbags are now loved by the likes of @entity95 and the @entity113 artsy : the bags , which cost around £ 1,500 , came in bright hues and splattered with tonal paints ca n't wait until next season to get your hands on one of her bags ? fear not			1
the designer , whose thousand - pound totes are loved by everyone from @entity127 to the @entity113 , has created a cut - price offering for her thrifty fans			1
she has exclusively designed special packs of @entity131 - renamed as @entity132 - which will be sold next to her famous tote bags and clutches in flagship stores from @entity137 to @entity138			1
there she is ! @entity0 runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and the late @entity147 as fans @entity149 : @entity95 ( left ) and @entity98 ( right ) attend the @entity24 presentation will he be toting one ? @entity97 sat on the front row at the @entity29 show the move comes after the success of her @entity17 cereal inspired handbags launched earlier this year featuring @entity159 ’s famous mascots @entity160 and @entity161 the @entity162			1
the cereal packs - made at @entity159 ’s @entity165 factory - will go on sale in @entity0 stores this week priced at £ 3 and are expected to sell out quickly following their launch at @entity9			0
@entity0 's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in @entity109 , @entity110			0
noting that drawstring leather duffle bags were popular , she borrowed £ 600 to import some to @entity172 and quickly sold 500 , with a little help from @entity175 & @entity176 magazine			0
a year later she had opened her first shop in @entity178			0
fast forward 25 years and she now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and the late @entity147 as fans			0
it looks like your new @entity186 totes have been knocked off the season 's most coveted list			0
