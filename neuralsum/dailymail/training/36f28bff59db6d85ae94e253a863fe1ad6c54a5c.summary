fearing a slew of @entity3 victories on @entity4 , @entity0 are relying on racially - charged campaign advertisements to turn blacks out to vote next tuesday			1
with the @entity7 and more than a dozen governors ' mansions up for grabs , @entity0 are hoping to relight a fire in the bellies of the president 's most loyal supporters			1
@entity3 say the ads go too far , though , and have slammed the ads over the top race - bating			2
one mailer in @entity19 features two black children on the cover and tells the recipient to vote ' if you want to prevent another @entity24 in their future			2
this flyer is being circulated by the @entity28 ahead of tuesday 's election			1
@entity3 have slammed it as race - baiting another flier created by the @entity28 says , ' it ’s up to us to vote to protect the legacy of the first @entity38 - @entity37 president , ' and the @entity39 reports that progressive group @entity40 has littered @entity42 mailboxes with mailers that say , ' enough ! republicans are targeting our kids , silencing our voices and even trying to impeach our president			1
' in @entity50 , senate majority leader @entity49 's @entity48 is running radio ads that ding @entity3 @entity7 nominee @entity52 for his support for the type of gun laws that ' caused the shooting death of @entity57			1
' ' it ’s not race - baiting ; it ’s actually happening , ' @entity61 , a leader of the @entity63 ’s @entity62 told the @entity39 , referring to a plethora of laws black feel unfairly target them , such as voter identification laws			2
' i ca n’t catch a fish unless there ’s a worm on the hook , ' he said			0
while the race - based ads have predominately appeared in southern states , the @entity28 of @entity73 is also circulating a pamphlet invoking segregation and ' birtherism , ' according to the @entity80			1
those flyers were paid for by the @entity82 , the @entity80 said , and are meant to drum up votes for lt. gov. @entity84 , who is locked in a tight race for @entity3 @entity86			0
' vote for @entity84 as @entity73 ’s first @entity38 governor , ' of the ads reportedly says			2
' history is watching to see if we vote			2
' ads like the one above are running in southern states as part of the @entity28 's attempt to get @entity38 - @entity37 voters to the polls it also includes images of sign for a ' colored waiting room , ' a ' @entity102 to vote ' sign and a photo of a white protester holding a sign that says , ' go back to @entity107 , ' according to the @entity80 , which did not publish photos of the mailers along with its story			1
on another page of the flyer real estate mogul @entity113 is pictured in front of a billboard that says , ' where ’s the birth certificate			0
' @entity113 has long been a skeptic of the origin of @entity121 's birth and even made a wager with the president to release the long form version			1
asked about the pamphlet by the @entity80 , the head of the @entity128 , @entity73 , @entity130 chapter , @entity125 told the @entity80 : ' i ca n’t control the @entity28			1
they should n’t do that			0
@entity125 said he had not seen the alleged ads , but said if the @entity28 ' should just let it go on the issues			2
' that said , @entity125 argued that ' it ’s a free democracy , if that ’s what they choose to do			0
' ' i guess everybody tries to exploit voters in one fashion or another , ' he added			0
former lt. gov. of @entity73 and the former chairman of the @entity150 @entity149 said it 's clear what @entity0 are trying to accomplish with racially - tinged ads. ' they have been playing on this nerve in the black community that if you even so much as look at a @entity3 , churches will start to burn , your civil rights will be taken away and young black men like @entity57 will die , ' @entity149 told the @entity39			1
' the reality of it is , the @entity0 realize that their most loyal constituency is not as loyal as they once were			0
' likewise , a current @entity150 spokesman , @entity165 , told @entity166 that ' he @entity150 ’s relationship and community based approach to black voter engagement is now focused on activating and mobilizing supporters that we ’ve reclaimed and recruited to the @entity3			0
' meanwhile , @entity0 are relying on racially divisive rhetoric to gin up unenthusiastic voters and distract from talking about their policies that have failed black communities , ' @entity165 said			0
@entity178 communications director @entity177 refused to condemn or officially condone the ads in @entity19 when confronted about them by @entity181 host @entity180 yesterday afternoon			0
' look do , i think it 's appropriate to constantly remind people how important it is to vote , how important it is to make your voice heard , how important it is to remain engaged , and how if you do n't , you lose your voice ? ' he said			1
' absolutely i think that 's important to keep doing			0
' ' but can you not do that without trotting out the images of dead black teenagers ? ' @entity180 , who is black , asked him			0
@entity177 responded with more talking points until the clock ran out on the segment a few moments later			0
with the @entity7 and more than a dozen governors ' mansions up for grabs , @entity0 are hoping that this ad , running in @entity19 , will relight a fire in the bellies of the president 's most loyal supporters african - americans , who make up a significant part of the @entity28 's voting bloc , do not traditionally turn out to vote in midterm elections as frequently as they do when the presidency is on the line			1
an analysis of @entity38 ' voting habits conducted by the @entity216 shows that roughly four of 10 @entity38 adults voted in recent congressional elections in non-presidential years			2
that number jumped to six in 10 both years @entity121 was on the ballot			2
recognizing the peril his party faces if blacks do n't come to his rescue once again , president @entity121 has taken to the airwaves in areas heavily populated by @entity38 to stump for @entity28 candidates			1
' i ’ll bet there are whole bunch of folks listening to your show who may not even know that there ’s an election going on			0
i need everybody to go vote , ' @entity121 said recently on the @entity239 , @entity19 , based @entity240			2
@entity121 has also appeared on civil rights leader @entity242 's radio show to make his case , as well as a handful of other shows that are popular with black audiences			1
while the president clearly believes that a personal plea from him to voters will help boost @entity28 candidates ' numbers in the south , embattled southern senators are n't so sure			1
@entity121 is not particularly popular there , or anywhere , for that matter			2
@entity42 sen. @entity257 , who is neck and neck with challenger @entity3 opponent , @entity260 , told @entity261 today that @entity121 ' has been a drag ' on his reelection chances			1
' i ’m just going to be honest about that			0
' ' people here know that i have had my fair share of disagreements with him and you can look at , you know , gun control issues			0
you can look at @entity273			0
you know , i never supported one of his budgets , ' @entity257 said , making a last - ditch effort to retain his seat in the federal legislature			2
' the reality of it is , the @entity0 realize that their most loyal constituency is not as loyal as they once were , ' @entity150 spokesman @entity165 said of the mailers @entity285 sen. @entity284 said yesterday in an interview that while she thinks @entity121 has likability problems in her state because of his energy policies , the @entity289 sentiment there cuts deeper than his policies			1
' to be very , very honest with you , the @entity294 has not always been the friendliest place to african - americans , ' she told @entity181 's @entity298 on thursday			1
' it ’s been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a positive light as a leader			0
she went on to say , ' it ’s not always been a good place for women to be able to present ourselves , it ’s more of a conservative place			0
' @entity284 's opponent in the race , @entity309 rep. @entity309 , fired back at her on @entity261 later that evening			1
' i wish she would focus more on policies instead of insulting , ' @entity309 told @entity261 's @entity313			1
' we ’re going through the political process to have a change – how our @entity317 prescribes how you do it – and we ’re called racist			0
' we ’re not racist , we just have common sense , ' he added .			0
