@entity0 has won us over with his charm in @entity5 's @entity4 commentary box @entity6 does n't take long to list just some of the things that make him angry			1
' well , being in the car would be number one – there 's quite a bit of yelling , ' he says			1
' and then i hate it when someone is not upfront			1
i 'm a tell - it - like - it - is kind of person ; i do n't like being misled or someone not telling the truth			1
' his voice gets louder			1
' and if people lie to me , especially my kids , well , i 'm not big on that			1
and i also do n't like it when people make rash decisions			1
if people do things without thinking them through , that rubs me up the wrong way			1
' clearly , he 's still a man you would n't want to get on the wrong side of , however charming he may seem in his job as a tv commentator			1
he may be one of the tennis greats , proud owner of seven @entity39 singles titles , but he 'll always be best known for his tantrums on court , the fury that would be vented at umpires , linesmen ... and his racquets			1
he has a funny relationship with that side of his fame , or perhaps we should call it infamy			1
on the one hand he realises it made him stand out and got people interested in watching him			2
but the controversy that surrounded him still rankles			2
' some of it was deserved , ' he concedes			2
' but it did feel like some of it was completely overboard , particularly in the @entity59			2
the attention that 's lavished on tennis , especially at @entity4 , is greater than anything i 've experienced			2
i felt like i was battling everybody			2
' i 'm 55 now and it would be amazing if a day went by where somebody did n't come up to me and say , " you can not be serious ! " but it never happens			2
that phrase , which i only really said once ( at @entity4 in 1981 ) , is part of me now			2
when i play at a veterans ' tournament – like the @entity74 at the @entity75 in december – if i do n't say it people are disappointed			2
it 's ironic – people used to want to suspend me and talk about how bad my behaviour was , but now they like it when i shout and scream			2
' so how does he sum up his relationship with the great @entity59 tennis - loving public ? ' it 's been a long run , and it 's gone to every extreme , but as time marches on it seems like we 've found inner peace , ' he says			1
it 's fair to say @entity0 is pretty much universally loved today as the @entity5 's charming and knowledgeable tennis commentator			1
he 's also an ambassador for insurance company @entity95 , the sponsor of @entity59 tennis			2
' i 'm having a lot more fun than i used to , ' he says			2
' now my work is about entertainment rather than a battle to the end			0
i can appreciate the experience a lot more			0
the girls and boys out there playing have a much more difficult time than i do			0
@entity0 in one of his famous rages after an umpires call at @entity4 in 1980 ' when i was playing i was very serious about what i was trying to do			1
often i was up against more intimidating , physical presences , so i had to get an edge through my intensity and my desire			0
i had to be super intense			0
' he 's glad people like him now			0
' it 's been a pleasant surprise , ' he says			0
' i felt very misunderstood before but some of that was because i was n't allowing people to see the whole package			1
through commentating i can display a different side of my personality			0
i do have a sense of humour			0
i have more time to think about things and the way i behave			0
' he was particularly glad not to have been in @entity132 's shoes just before @entity4 last year			0
' i never had as much attention as @entity132 gets but i think i understand what he was going through more than most			0
it 's brilliant he broke the losing streak – and @entity59 finally had a @entity4 champion			0
there wo n't be the same degree of pressure on him this year ; but believe me , once you win it you want to win it again			0
' ' i congratulated @entity145 when i saw him because i thought it was a job well done			0
as much as we had issues on the court , i think there 's a mutual respect between us			1
' @entity132 was coached by @entity0 's on - and - off court rival @entity152 ; despite the derogatory comments traded between the two men in their heyday , he admits he admired the job @entity152 did on the @entity157			1
' i congratulated @entity145 when i saw him because i thought it was a job well done , ' he says			0
' as much as we had issues on the court , i think there 's a mutual respect between us			1
' his other most famous court foe was @entity165 ; despite their rivalry they became friends and remain so , often meeting on the veteran pro circuit			1
@entity0 still plays tennis twice a week at his academy near his @entity172 home and goes to the gym three times			1
he 's also an unlikely fan of gentle @entity175 , which he does once a week			0
his hobby is playing the guitar and he 's a keen collector of modern art. ' artists and tennis players have a lot in common ; you 're out there , unarmoured , by yourself			0
i mainly buy ; i enjoy waking up and seeing something that gives me pleasure			0
' despite the list of things that still annoy him , @entity0 's clearly calmed down a little			1
he attributes that partly to being a father ; he has five children			0
the eldest three , from his famously volatile first marriage to former drug - addict actress @entity192 , have all left home			1
but the younger two with his second wife , musician @entity195 – 15 - year - old @entity195 and 18 - year - old @entity196 – are still at home			1
' my kids would tell you i still have a temper but i 'm more even - keeled than i was , ' he says			1
' being a father forces you to try and become steadier			0
if you 're wildly inconsistent that 's tough for kids to handle			0
' it helps that i 'm in a good situation with my wife ; i try to be a good husband			0
i 've had therapy and that can be helpful			0
my goal each year is to be one per cent better , more empathetic than i was			0
if i feel there 's been a slight improvement then that 's all the victory i need these days			0
' @entity0 is an @entity214 brand ambassador and presents @entity4 coverage on the @entity5 from monday , see pages 16 - 17 for more details .			1
