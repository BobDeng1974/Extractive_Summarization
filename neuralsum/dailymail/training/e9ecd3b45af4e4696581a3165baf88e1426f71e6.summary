by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:30 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 10:27 est , 8 may 2012 rival : @entity3 , leader of the @entity5 party , yesterday met with leader of the election - winning @entity4 , @entity8 @entity10 ’s radical left - wing @entity5 party insisted the country ’s commitment to austerity was no longer valid after voters turned their backs on bailout deals , as its leader tried to form a new coalition government on tuesday			1
@entity3 , head of the @entity5 that came a surprise second in sunday ’s election , appeared determined to act on the punishing message sent by voters fed - up with austerity by defying stern warnings from the @entity25 and @entity26 for the country to stick to its agreed bailout deal or risk default			1
he called on @entity10 ’s two main party leaders , the conservative @entity32 and @entity33 to reverse their support for the multi-billion euro bailout that is keeping @entity10 from bankruptcy			2
' there is no way we will attempt to sneak back what the @entity10 people threw out in the election , ' he said , referring to a slew of recent austerity measures which include drastic pension and salary cuts and tax hikes			1
' the public has voted in large masses against the barbaric policies of the @entity25 memorandum , ' said @entity3 , who is determined to seek a left - led coalition which will reject the bailout terms			0
his goal will be to win over the @entity55 of @entity10 , @entity55 , but his efforts may prove fruitless , after the communists already rejected any possibility of cooperation with @entity5			1
the @entity60 , seen as a more moderate and @entity62 party already gave @entity5 its backing			2
voters ended up punishing mainstream parties , @entity32 and the @entity33 , for their handling of the financial crisis which has forced the country in a fifth year of recession and encountered record unemployment			0
instead , the electorate directed their support to several smaller parties , ranging from moderate leftists to the extreme right fascist party @entity76 accused for attacks against immigrants			1
a large proportion , disillusioned with the entire political system which they see as being corrupt refused to even vote , with abstention recorded at an all time high at 35 per cent			0
@entity3 will be given three days to seek coalition partners to clinch a deal before the mandate is passed to former finance minister @entity87 , whose @entity33 party came in third			1
if no agreement can be found new elections will be called , probably for june			0
disenchanted : supporters of the @entity88 applaud as they watch exit polls at a party 's kiosk in @entity95 on sunday , as voters deserted governing parties divided citizens : @entity32 party leader @entity99 won the election , but his party was unable to form a government more than six in ten @entity10 voted against austerity measures			1
of these , some put their faith in neo-nazi party @entity76 - led by @entity107 - which won seven per cent of the vote			1
fresh elections would only increase fears the country 's deficit - cutting program could be derailed			0
they could also hinder @entity116 's painful efforts to resolve the beleaguered country 's debt crisis			0
shares were hammered by nearly seven per cent on the @entity120 yesterday , and were down a further 1.3 per cent by midday trading today			0
the government , however , managed to raise 1.3billion euros ( $ 1.69bn ) in a debt auction today , with @entity10 's short - term borrowing costs continuing to creep up			2
it sold six - month treasury bills at an interest rate of 4.69 per cent , compared with a 4.55 per cent rate at an auction last month			0
neo-nazis gain ground : @entity107 , leader of extreme - right @entity76 , which also opposes austerity measures			2

@entity5 leader @entity3 has three days to put together government
if deal not made in a week , there will be further elections in june
neo-nazi party @entity76 won 7 *%* of vote
@entity3 said there was no way he would let @entity10 ' sneak back ' to austerity
