by @entity1 - potter and @entity2 published : 19:06 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 3 august 2013 it seemed to be the duffest weather forecast since 1987 when poor old @entity5 told tv viewers : ‘ @entity7 ? what hurricane ? ’ – or words to that effect			1
after a summit to discuss unusual weather patterns , it was widely reported that we could be locked in a decade of soaking wet summers			1
we should have known better			0
our forecasters are even less reliable than our weather			0
more recent predictions said we would suffer a ‘ colder - than - average ’ july			1
the reality has so far proved very different , with the longest heatwave for seven years set to continue			1
but these are the facts : @entity48 is here to stay : despite forecasters ' predictions , the @entity49 will bask in more sunshine next week busy beach : the seafront at @entity55 as @entity49 basking in another day of hot temperatures - and it is set to last until next week summer sun : people relax by the fountains in @entity60 , central @entity61 , as a @entity36 level three heatwave warning remains in force police and fire services have also warned people to be careful when swimming in open water following several deaths in recent weeks , including that of a 69 - year - old woman in the sea off @entity73 , @entity74 , on friday			1
so how could our forecasters have got it so wrong ? reports of a gloomy forecast came after a climate summit at the @entity81 in @entity82 last month , when professor @entity83 , head of the @entity36 ’s @entity84 for climate research , said the country may be involved in ‘ a cycle of wetter summers ’			1
a week later , the @entity36 ’s june 27 forecast predicted a cool and wet month – despite the fact that we are now , happily , on course for the driest july since records began in 1910			1
the @entity36 said the comments had been misinterpreted and denied that there had been a prediction			1
so on friday i managed to catch up with @entity97 at @entity98 to seek an explanation			0
prof @entity83 , who heads the university ’s meteorology department was doing his best to enjoy the heatwave , rolling up his shirt sleeves , and wearing slacks and trainers			2
living on the edge , he even opened his window			0
perhaps it was my @entity110 shirt , lobster - red forehead and flip - flops but he was beyond tight - lipped when i offered him a courtesy sombrero and beachball			2
our other gift – a @entity119 lolly – might have lured him but sadly it had long since melted into a sticky mess			0
‘ no , ’ he said tersely , as i invited him to embrace summer with @entity121 , before escaping to the shadows behind the university bike shed			0
even though temperatures are forecast to touch @entity127 this week , scientists and weathermen still fear our summers could be doomed – blaming the rain on warmer @entity131 sea temperatures			1
professor @entity83 ’s colleague dr @entity132 – a leading climate change expert who also took part in june ’s meeting – said he still believed 2013 could prove to be a washout			1
he said : ‘ there is a difference between climate and weather			0
this heatwave could just be a blip and will soon be over in any case – in about two weeks			2
and if we have a really wet august , this could still go down as a wet summer			0
’ but he added : ‘ there are other factors involved so it ’s very hard to predict			0
land temperatures are – because of climate change – generally rising			0
’ blaze near the beach : a fire , at the beauty spot of @entity156 , on @entity157 , @entity158 , burned for several hours , destroying giant swathes of protected nature reserve @entity162 fire : sunbathers were forced to flee a beach in @entity157 , @entity158 , as a fire breaked out close to where they were lying			0
firefighters said the blaze was a suspected arson attack @entity49 's roads struggled to cope with an extra seven million motorists yesterday as sun - seekers headed for the coast and theme parks			1
some areas saw tailbacks of up to 20 miles , with the @entity177 hit hardest			2
about 100,000 sunseekers packed @entity180 ’s seven - mile beach and there were similar scenes at @entity55			2
the great getaway coincided with the start of the school holidays in many areas			0
‘ our breakdown call - outs are up by about 10 per cent and most of the calls are to cars which have overheated , ’ said the @entity187			0
‘ clearly , everybody has been heading to the beach			0
’ @entity194 melts tarmac : a melted road surface in the centre of @entity198 after a prolonged spell of hot weather across @entity49			2
it has gathered around the raised central reservation , which was recently resurfaced for £ 300,000 meltdown : @entity49 has basked in several consecutive days of temperatures higher than @entity205 - and in @entity198 the road has melted meanwhile , a fleet of snow gritters were in action across @entity210 yesterday			1
a fine stone dust was being sprayed on the roads to stop them warping after the asphalt became sticky in the heat			1
however , the scorching hot weather has taken its toll on the @entity49			2
soaring temperatures are believed to have caused up to 760 premature deaths , and the @entity49 @entity219 has launched two call centres in @entity221 and @entity222 to check on elderly and vulnerable people in the region			1
there have been grass fires in several areas of @entity61 , mountain blazes in the @entity230 valleys			1
and a large area of @entity232 in @entity233 has been devastated			2
l a post-mortem is under way after a teenage girl collapsed at @entity237 , @entity238 , which was packed with families enjoying the sunshine			0
the girl was airlifted to the @entity241 but could not be saved			0
too hot for the road : a long stretch of tarmac in @entity198 will now have to be resurfaced after being melted by the hot weather summer gritting : a council has sent out gritting lorries in @entity249 , @entity210 , to help keep the roads cool and to stop the tarmac from melting in the heat			1

scientists talked of a cycle of soaking and predicted a cool and wet month
but @entity49 's longest heatwave for seven years is set to continue next week
@entity49 is on course for the driest july since records began in 1910
but one @entity36 officer expert insists it 's just a ' blip '
temperatures are set to soar again to @entity265 ( @entity266 ) *tomorrow* in many areas of @entity49 .
in @entity270 yesterday it was hotter than @entity271 .
there have been grass fires in @entity61 , mountain blazes in the @entity230 valleys and forest fires in the @entity279 town of @entity233 .
the heatwave is believed to have caused up to 760 premature deaths .
a&es have been *overwhelmed* with half - a - million people attending departments last week .
snow gritters were in action in @entity210 yesterday to stop the county ’s roads from melting . but rather than salt , they were spraying a fine stone dust over warping roads where the asphalt hit @entity296 .
