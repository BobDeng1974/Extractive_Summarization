@entity75 , who was already in trouble with @entity90 after writing a disobliging article about the monarch , was forced to flee abroad to escape further obscenity charges			0
while the scandalous antics of @entity75 and @entity96 form one of the most eye - catching parts of the display , the exhibition also focuses on other , more innocent pastimes popularised by the @entity8			1
