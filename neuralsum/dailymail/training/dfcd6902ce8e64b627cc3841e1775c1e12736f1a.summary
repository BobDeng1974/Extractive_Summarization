researchers have worked a way to predict how everything from a face to a raisin will wrinkle			0
they say their algorithm can accurately predict wrinkles on a curved surface for the first time			1
they say it helps explain how our fingerprints , and wrinkles on our face , form over time			1
a team of @entity19 mathematicians and engineers has developed a mathematical theory , confirmed through experiments , that predicts how wrinkles on curved surfaces take shape - even on skin			1
as a grape slowly dries and shrivels , its surface creases , ultimately taking on the wrinkled form of a raisin			1
similar patterns can be found on the surfaces of other dried materials , as well as in human fingerprints			0
' if you look at skin , there 's a harder layer of tissue , and underneath is a softer layer , and you see these wrinkling patterns that make fingerprints , ' says @entity44 , an assistant professor of mathematics at @entity19			1
' could you , in principle , predict these patterns ? it 's a complicated system , but there seems to be something generic going on , because you see very similar patterns over a huge range of scales			0
' while these patterns have long been observed in nature , and more recently in experiments , scientists have not been able to come up with a way to predict how such patterns arise in curved systems , such as microlenses			2
@entity63 of @entity19 mathematicians and engineers has developed a mathematical theory , confirmed through experiments , that predicts how wrinkles on curved surfaces take shape			1
from their calculations , they determined that one main parameter — curvature — rules the type of pattern that forms : the more curved a surface is , the more its surface patterns resemble a crystal - like lattice			2
the researchers say the theory , reported this week in the journal @entity82 , may help to generally explain how fingerprints and wrinkles form			1
in past experiments , @entity85 manufactured ping pong - sized balls of polymer in order to investigate how their surface patterns may affect a sphere 's drag , or resistance to air			0
the group sought to develop a general theory to describe how wrinkles on curved objects form — a goal that was initially inspired by observations made by @entity44 's collaborator , @entity85 , the @entity85 career development associate professor in @entity104			1
in past experiments , @entity85 manufactured ping pong - sized balls of polymer in order to investigate how their surface patterns may affect a sphere 's drag , or resistance to air			0
@entity85 observed a characteristic transition of surface patterns as air was slowly sucked out : as the sphere 's surface became compressed , it began to dimple , forming a pattern of regular hexagons before giving way to a more convoluted , labyrinthine configuration , similar to fingerprints			2
' existing theories could not explain why we were seeing these completely different patterns , ' @entity85 says			0
in computer simulations , the researchers confirmed that their equation was indeed able to reproduce correctly the surface patterns observed in experiments			0
they were therefore also able to identify the main parameters that govern surface patterning			0
as it turns out , curvature is one major determinant of whether a wrinkling surface becomes covered in hexagons or a more labyrinthine pattern : the more curved an object , the more regular its wrinkled surface			2
the thickness of an object 's shell also plays a role : if the outer layer is very thin compared to its curvature , an object 's surface will likely be convoluted , similar to a fingerprint			0
if the shell is a bit thicker , the surface will form a more hexagonal pattern .			2
