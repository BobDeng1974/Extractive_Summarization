by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 30 january 2013 professor @entity1 has sparked new health fears by pulling out of a trip to @entity4			1
the renowned cosmologist was due to speak at a conference in the @entity7 of @entity8 on february 6			1
he informed authorities he would not be able to attend over the weekend , citing health reasons			1
the most recent picture of professor @entity1 show him trying out a new speech system			1
it was confirmed today he has pulled out of a trip to @entity4 on medical advice the 71 - year - old , diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21 , missed two birthday parties last year because of health problems			1
a spokesman said last night he had suspended his trip to @entity4 on medical advice but insisted it was nothing ' too serious			1
' @entity1 said he expects to visit ' in the near future , ' according to reports			1
the physicist had been invited by the @entity4 vice president @entity28 during a visit he paid to @entity30 in august 2012			1
@entity28 , currently in charge of the @entity32 , wished him a speedy recovery			1
many experts say professor @entity1 has defied medical science by reaching the age of 71 as his degenerative illness usually proves fatal within five years of diagnosis			1
professor @entity1 has become as much a celebrity as he is a scientist , appearing on tv cartoon @entity42 , starring in @entity43 and providing narration for a @entity46 commercial that was later sampled on a @entity48 album			1
he also starred in the 2012 @entity50 opening ceremony , and in a tv ad for an insurance firm			1
however , his condition worsened recently , causing him to struggle to communicate			1
the world renowned physicist has for the past ten years composed his sentences one letter at a time using a twitch of his cheek to stop a cursor as it moves across an on - screen keyboard			1
professor @entity1 was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21			1
@entity64 ( @entity64 ) attacks the nervous system and leaves muscles damaged , causing loss of mobility and difficulties with speech , swallowing and breathing			1
one in 50,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year and sufferers usually die within five years of its onset			2
its cause is a mystery but some experts believe an individual 's damaged genetic make - up might be a contributory factor			2
there is currently no cure			2
@entity1 , who is confined to a wheelchair , is the world 's best known sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis			2
he is an exceptional case , having survived for more than 40 years , despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed			2
after he painstakingly crafts his sentences one word at a time , a computer attached to his wheelchair reads them out in the distinctive metallic voice for which he is known			2
but recently the disease from which he suffers has made his cheek twitch more difficult to control , significantly slowing the rate at which one of the world 's sharpest minds is able to communicate with the outside world			2
to help , computer hardware firm @entity107 recently announced it was giving him a device it hopes will help the professor compose up to ten words a minute			2
the world - renowned physicist has used a computerised speech generator for years , composing sentences one letter at a time using a twitch of his cheek			2
his worsening physical condition has left him able to manage around just one word a minute			0
@entity107 began working on professor @entity1 's new device in 2011 , after he asked for help from @entity107 co-founder @entity123 - the man behind computing 's famous ' @entity124 ' , which says processing power will double every two years			0
the new system uses facial recognition technology to recognise not only @entity1 's cheek movements , but also twitches from his mouth and eyebrows to send words to a new speech machine			0
@entity135 , @entity107 ’s chief technology officer , told @entity137 magazine that the upgrade comes after technology finally caught up with the complicated concepts @entity1 wanted to express			0
' we ’ve built a new , character - driven interface in modern terms that includes a better word predictor , ' he said			0
' up to now , [ previous ] technologies did n’t work well enough to satisfy someone like @entity1 , who wants to produce a lot of information			0
' professor @entity1 speaks during the @entity149 for the @entity150 in @entity30 the new technology offers the professor the opportunity to use two different signals to express himself , which means he could even communicate using @entity156 which , said mr @entity135 , ' would be a great improvement '			0
professor @entity1 took to his personal blog to tell how grateful he is for the new technology that allows him to continue to speak			1
' @entity161 ’s voice is very important , ' he wrote			0
' if you have a slurred voice , people are likely to treat you as mentally deficient			0
' this [ computer ] synthesiser is by far the best i have heard , because it varies the intonation , and does n’t speak like a dalek			1
' the only trouble is that it gives me an @entity172 accent			0
' @entity107 has worked with professor @entity1 since the late @entity173 to provide the technology he needs to express himself			0
in the 1970s , already confined to a wheelchair , he produced a stream of first class research , including probably his most important contribution to cosmology			0
this was the discovery of @entity1 radiation , which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing			0
by applying quantum mechanics to black holes , he had taken the first steps to combining quantum theory and general relativity			0
one describes the universe at the sub-atomic level , and the other at very large scales			0
bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics			0
in the 1980s , prof @entity1 and professor @entity199 , from the @entity200 at @entity201 , proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time			0
the concept was described in @entity207 , which sold 25 million copies worldwide .			0
