by @entity0 published : 16:37 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 03:54 est , 27 september 2012 the top rate of tax will stay at 45p until the next election because @entity5 faces a descent into extremism if it diverts from its austerity drive , @entity1 said yesterday			1
making his keynote address at the @entity11 conference in @entity12 , he said there could be ‘ no question ’ of further reducing the income tax charged on earnings over £ 150,000			1
conservatives will , however , be cheered by mr @entity1 ’s steadfast backing for the government ’s attempts to rein in public spending			2
@entity5 must accept ‘ further belt - tightening ’ beyond the next election as expenditure is out of control , he suggested – pointing out the country is still borrowing £ 1billion every three days			1
the deputy prime minister even suggested state spending had ‘ undermined ’ @entity5 ’s prosperity , pointing to the sevenfold increase in the welfare budget over the last 50 years while the economy grew only threefold			2
mr @entity1 said @entity50 had ‘ plunged @entity5 into austerity ’ by ‘ crashing the economy and racking up record debts ’			1
thoughts : mr @entity1 said any future cuts in taxation must pass ' one clear test : do they help people on low and middle incomes get by ? ' he singled out shadow chancellor @entity59 for particular criticism , accusing him of inhabiting a ‘ fantasy world where there is no boom and bust and the money never runs out ’			1
the deputy prime minister painted an apocalyptic picture of the potential consequences unless the @entity69 responds by dealing with its debts and tackling economic weaknesses			0
‘ our influence in the world , our standard of living , our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance – all are in the balance , ’ he said			0
‘ for power would move not only away from the liberal and democratic world , but within it too ; from moderates to hardliners , from internationalists to isolationists , from those committed to the politics of co-operation to those hell - bent on confrontation			0
‘ if history has taught us anything , it is that extremists thrive in tough times			0
so to those who ask , incredulously , what we – the @entity11 – are doing cutting public spending , i simply say this : who suffers most when governments go bust ? when they can no longer pay salaries , benefits and pensions ? not the bankers and the hedge fund managers , that ’s for sure			2
no , it would be the poor , the old , the infirm – those with the least to fall back on			0
’ couple : @entity1 ( right ) with his wife @entity113 ( left ) following his keynote speech at the conference in @entity12 mr @entity1 cheered the party faithful – and made clear his own determination to remain leader until the next election in 2015 – by unveiling his predecessor @entity121 as the head of his election campaign			1
' our influence in the world , our standard of living , our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance – all are in the balance ' @entity1 , deputy prime minister and he admitted that walking out of the @entity133 was ‘ an alluring prospect in some ways ’			2
but he insisted there could be no return for the @entity11 to a ‘ stop the world i want to get off party ’ – a swipe at critics who want to veer to the left			0
earlier he had told opponents in the party that if they did n’t like him they should vote @entity50			0
last night @entity146 sources said mr @entity147 was ‘ pretty relaxed ’ about mr @entity1 ’s declaration on the 45p tax rate			1
‘ this is @entity1 setting out the @entity11 position , ’ said one			1
‘ it is safe to say that cutting the 45p rate is not @entity156 ’s priority			0

@entity1 was making keynote address at @entity11 conference in @entity12
said future tax cuts must help people on low and *medium* incomes get by
