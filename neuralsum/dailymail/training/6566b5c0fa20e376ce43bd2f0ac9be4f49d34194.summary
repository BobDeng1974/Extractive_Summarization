@entity0 , the alternative cricket commentary which operates from central @entity1 not from @entity0 venues , has this week been described as a ' predator ' that needs to be ' nailed ' and ' swept offline '			1
here @entity6 , the editor of @entity7 , who owns @entity9 , hits back at those allegations ... earlier this year , one of the oldest voices in cricket took a leap of faith and jumped into bed with one of the newest			1
the @entity7 , established in 1921 by @entity17 , saw in @entity0 , an irreverent online cricket commentary service established in @entity18 in 2009 by @entity19 , a spark of innovative potential that it simply could not afford to pass up			1
the tie - up was never going to be to everyone ’s taste , but like two inter-joining circles on a @entity27 diagram , that was never really the point			2
in a print media market that seems to be shrinking as quickly as broadband speeds are rising , innovation is vital if you want to stay afloat			0
@entity33 expects : @entity34 ( second , left ) takes evasive action from a shot by @entity37 of @entity38 ' a ' during the final day of @entity33 's first warm - up match @entity0 is an online broadcaster providing cricket ball - by - ball commentary for all @entity33 test matches and selected @entity42			1
the station is available worldwide serving as alternative commentary to the @entity46 's @entity45 which is only available in the @entity47			1
the station began broadcasting from the @entity51 home of one of the station 's creators , @entity19 , but moved to a rented house in @entity56 , also in @entity1 , in august 2010			0
in january 2011 , @entity0 moved to an undisclosed location , believed to be somewhere in central @entity1			1
listeners interact with the show 's commentators through @entity61 , with this interaction often influencing the agenda			0
follow @entity0 on @entity61 @ @entity64 the @entity65 saw in @entity0 a cult following of young , technologically savvy cricket fans – a demographic that it might not have attracted by any other means			1
in return the @entity70 was offered shelter and status , and a chance for that seed of a concept to germinate			0
at a stroke , each had doubled their potential audience , and shored up the other ’s foundations			0
it was , and remains , a win - win scenario			0
we expected resistance to our venture , and it duly arrived – though not from the quarters we had imagined			0
the @entity88 , recognising that we were not breaching any rights , ceased correspondence on the subject back in may , ahead of @entity33 ’s @entity91 against @entity92			1
@entity45 , on the other hand , have taken the @entity70 ’s existence as a personal slight – culminating in a declaration on wednesday that it needed to be ' nailed ' and ' swept offline '			0
we 're flattered by @entity9 ’s attention , but baffled by their hostility			1
at what point in that magnificent programme 's evolution did the promotion of cricket become a zero - sum game ? to complain , as they do , that @entity0 is a ' predator ' that pays nothing for rights and gives nothing in return is a sad parody of the public access position the @entity46 once held dear			1
after a summer in which rain , the @entity115 and the @entity116 combined to squeeze cricket to the margins of public interest , surely the game needs as many people as possible to make as much noise on its behalf as is feasible			0
anyone who believes otherwise might also argue against letting schoolkids enter for free on the fifth day of a test			0
the @entity70 does not profess to fill the void by any means , but it provides a start			0
through the use of @entity61 ( @ testmatchsofa ) , every listener is offered a voice that , as often as not , will help dictate the narrative of the day ’s play			0
in so doing , we aim to cement the enjoyment of a new breed of cricket listener – ones who , like those who will doubtless enter their blog comments below – want a conversation with their commentators , not a lecture			0
different audience : the @entity0 crew pose up surely , if any @entity46 institution could still be relied upon to uphold the company 's @entity149 principles it should be @entity9 , the voice of cricket for more than half a century and , let 's be frank about this , the very reason why @entity156 and his colleagues were inspired to establish the @entity70 in the first place			1
without exception , the sofa team venerates @entity9			1
every one of the enthusiastic amateurs who give up their own time to watch cricket in a windowless studio do so because their youths were misspent with radios under their pillows and @entity169 in their stockings			0
window to the world : members of the @entity173 test match special team in the commentary box at @entity175 with the window cut out on the far right			0
front row , from left , @entity179 , @entity180 and scorer @entity181			1
back row from left , producer @entity183 , assistant producer @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 @entity45 ( known as @entity9 ) provides ball - by - ball coverage of most @entity191 , @entity42 , and @entity193 matches and tournaments involving @entity33			1
it is , rightly , considered by most cricket lovers the place to listen to coverage of @entity33 matches			1
@entity173 was the first broadcaster to cover every ball of a test match			0
@entity9 is broadcast on @entity204 long wave ( 198 lw )			1
at times of cricket matches , the normal @entity204 schedule continues on its fm frequencies , while longwave is taken over by the cricket			0
this has sparked controversy with some @entity204 listeners unable to change frequencies			0
the shipping forecast is , however , retained			0
@entity9 can also be heard via the @entity215			2
@entity9 's coverage of @entity33 's tour to @entity38 had been under threat over fees demanded by the @entity221 board to broadcast from the grounds			1
however , @entity9 producer @entity45 revealed on @entity61 on thursday that a deal had finally been reached			2
' we are pleased to confirm that @entity45 will broadcast @entity33 's cricket tour of @entity38 from the grounds , ' he said			2
follow @entity45 on @entity61 @ tmsproducer @entity180 and @entity187 remain two of the greatest broadcasters of any generation			2
but as a homogenized @entity9 leans more and more on ex-pros and multi-sports specialists to fill the vacancies that crop up in the course of time , one wonders where the next @entity237 and @entity238 will appear to infuse cricket commentary with the whimsy and digressions of old ? i ’d suggest , right now , the @entity70 is the likelier of the breeding grounds			2
and yet , @entity9 is still the undisputed master of the airwaves			2
earlier this year , the question was put to me , rhetorically , what would happen if the @entity46 chose to stop broadcasting from the grounds and tried to do it off the telly ? on account of the @entity38 access row , we might be about to find out … and i think the answer has come as a greater surprise to the @entity46			1
@entity183 , the former @entity9 producer , understood the value of his product ( and by extension the rights that the @entity46 pay ) when in 1999 , he demanded that a special window be cut in the middle of the enormous sheet of glass covering the front of the new lord ’s media centre			1
quite rightly , he wanted to be able to dangle his effects mike into the crowd to provide total aural immersion to @entity9 ’s legions of listeners			2
that sense of being there is priceless – it ’s the hum of contented silence that tells you you ’ve twiddled your long - wave radio to the right frequency – and it ’s something that the @entity280 , rarely slow to spot a changing trend , have recognised			0
radio rights per se are irrelevant in the internet age			0
you can no sooner stop @entity0 from commenting on the action than demand silence while fans watch it in the pub. the true value lies in being able to call it from the ground			2
remarkably , it has taken the @entity70 ’s existence to remind @entity9 quite how important they are			2
@entity293 is editor of @entity294 , who own @entity9 after reading the @entity65 on thursday , test match special presenter @entity180 tweeted : ' i 've never read such hypocrisy & assumed knowledge as that spouted by the once great @entity7 today			1
i wo n't be reading it again			0
' @entity33 's @entity193 captain and former @entity303 columnist @entity301 also weighed in to the argument , saying : ' do n't read the media @entity180 ... what have i told you ! ! can only bring negativity to your world ! '			1

we 're no predator and no threat , @entity0 hits back at @entity46
@entity293 left baffled by hostility from @entity46
@entity9 anchor @entity180 responds by *threatening* never to read magazine again
@entity33 *t20* captain @entity301 supports @entity180 in row
