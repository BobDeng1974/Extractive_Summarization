it is a common fear , known as trypanophobia			0
for around 20 per cent of the population , the thought of going to the doctors for an injection invokes a deep - rooted sense of dread			2
many avoid the doctor 's surgery altogether , leaving themselves open to the risk of various illnesses and infections			2
but for those terrified of needles , a team of scientists at @entity15 in @entity16 , may have the answer			0
they have developed a new device , @entity21 , to ease the pain of an injection			2
their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient 's skin			1
' our device is @entity50 printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water , ' mr @entity41 said			1
' a simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction			2
' we then numb the skin by contacting the device 's metal surface to the patient 's skin			1
' current solutions are either ineffective because they fail to numb the skin adequately , or take too long , the researchers said			0
they noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work , whereas their new device ' works on the order of seconds and minutes ' , mr @entity42 said			1
' we are targeting anyone who has to get an injection , which is nearly everyone , ' mr @entity43 said			0
' but the device is especially applicable to people who are more susceptible to pain			2
' as such , he said , it is particularly useful for children and the elderly			0
and , it is intended for use during procedures ' where you have to get shots in more sensitive areas of the body , such as the face or the groin ' , he added			0
the team designed the device to be single - use , rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device			1
it costs around $ 2 ( £ 1.34 ) to produce , they said the trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing , and help reduce swelling			1
' we looked into all sorts of methods for numbing , both quick and long - term , chemicals , using ice packs - which is similar to what we 're using now , ' mr @entity41 said			0
the device is @entity50 printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water			1
a simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction			2
the skin can then be numbed by contacting the device 's metal surface to the patient 's skin			1
within 60 seconds the patient 's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain			1
' we explored everything that surrounded the problem before we even began brainstorming			0
' ' at the end of the day , what we 're creating is a self - contained device with a very cold contact surface , and there are many applications for that , ' mr @entity43 added			2
some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree , or skills the first - year students had not yet learned			1
' that 's the kind of amazing thing about our project , ' mr @entity43 said			0
' because we do n't have these incredibly refined skills in certain areas , that meant we had to think of very simple solutions			0
' being limited in that way led to something that is very novel and innovative , but at the same time , simple and elegant			0
' the team designed the device to be single - use , rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device			1
mr @entity42 , said : ' the materials that we use are relatively inexpensive and found in abundance : plastic , rubber and metal			0
the team from @entity15 in @entity16 said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos , or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain ' the materials for one of these cost about a quarter , and then we just had to do estimates based on how much manufacturing would cost			1
' we compared our device to similar things already in production , and we 've estimated the cost at about $ 2 ( £ 1.34 )			1
' the team is currently in the process of applying for a provisional patent for the device , and the students hope to continue their work together in their spare time when they return to @entity187 in their second year			1
' as a team , we just want to follow the project , because we think it has a lot of potential			0
i think that 's what drew us to this specific project , ' mr @entity43 said			0
' we have n't really discussed yet whether we 're going dedicate to making this a company , but it 's something we 're open to			0

comfortably @entity32 is a single - use @entity50 printed device that numbs the skin
produces a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient 's skin in 60 seconds
invention costs around $ 2 to make and could help millions terrified of pain
three first - year students behind invention say it could work for tattoos too
