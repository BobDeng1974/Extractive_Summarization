@entity1 's £ 60million record signing @entity2 has been excellent since he arrived from @entity3			1
he is a real star			0
however , @entity4 will have to find a way to get him more involved in games when his side do n’t dominate play			0
he was quiet on sunday — as he was against @entity9 last weekend — and did n’t give his full - back @entity11 too much help either			0
the goal came from @entity15 ’s pass with @entity16 just watching			0
@entity2 struggled to get involved against @entity17 beware the goat , @entity19 former @entity1 defender and now @entity22 pundit @entity21 spent some time on the touchline catching up with members of his old club ’s backroom staff before kick - off but then ran into an old adversary in the form of @entity17 legend @entity30			1
is it really almost 12 years since @entity21 gifted ‘ @entity32 ’ the famous goal in @entity17 ’s 3 - 1 win in the last ever @entity36 derby ? @entity30 scored against @entity1 in the final derby at @entity36 @entity21 had nowhere to hide from the home fans as @entity17 won the last derby at @entity36 in 2002 @entity41 atmosphere flat before ko @entity42 caused some ripples this weekend with his comments about the lack of atmosphere at @entity47 , and it must be said it was n’t great before kick - off here either			1
the situation is not helped by the pre-match entertainment put on by @entity17 outside the ground			2
it ’s great for fans but means they do n’t enter the ground until the last minute and ca n’t build the tension ahead of a big game			0
slim pickings at centre back @entity62 prevented @entity17 ’s marquee summer signing @entity64 from competing for a place in the centre of defence , but the @entity68 has not looked entirely comfortable in the @entity69			2
interestingly , @entity1 scouted him extensively last season only to conclude he was too prone to errors			2
unlike @entity72 ... @entity1 scouted @entity64 ( right ) but decided he was too prone to errors @entity72 earned a second booking and an early exit for this challenge on @entity77 on sunday @entity79 red ' not smart ' - @entity80			1

@entity2 struggled to make an impact against @entity17
@entity84 ran into @entity30 before the derby at the @entity41
@entity1 *considered* @entity64 but felt he was error - prone
