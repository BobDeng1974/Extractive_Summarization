' and away from sport , @entity16 , which will broadcast @entity3 vs @entity4 in @entity15 alongside @entity13 , issued take down notices last week after the season five premiere of hit show @entity61 was streamed			1
' we are aware of @entity10 and have sent takedown notices , ' an @entity16 spokeswoman said in a statement			1
' in general , we feel developers should have tools which proactively prevent mass copyright infringement from occurring on their apps and not be solely reliant upon notifications			0

click here to read @entity10 's terms of service periscope ' lets you share and experience live video from your mobile phone ' and is ' a perfect complement to @entity20 , which is why we acquired the company in january , ' @entity20 's @entity107 said in a blog post			1
' it may sound crazy , but we wanted to build the closest thing to teleportation , ' claim the @entity10 team			2
' while there are many ways to discover events and places , we realized there is no better way to experience a place right now than through live video			1
' however , its terms of service claims it does not support copyright infringement , but currently relies on reports from users alerting the company to the infringement			0
' we respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect @entity10 users to do the same , ' the @entity135 read			2
' we will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us			0
' the company has a team dedicated to content review , has the right to remove any illegal content and shut down a person 's account if they are found to be violating the @entity135			0
one possible precedent is the use of another app , @entity153 , which allows users to upload six - second clips			0
the @entity156 was last year forced to remind people not to post copyrighted material after fans started recording goals and sharing them with their friends over social media - with many unaware that what they were doing was illegal			1
the most popular @entity153 football accounts have hundreds of thousands of followers , despite @entity20 stating : ' @entity153 users may not post content that violates the rights of a third party			0
' @entity3 ( left ) trains with his uncle @entity170 during a media workout in @entity172 in an interview with the @entity176 , director communications @entity173 said : ' you can understand that fans see something , they can capture it , they can share it , but ultimately it is against the law			1
' ' it 's a breach of copyright and we would discourage fans from doing it , we 're developing technologies like gif crawlers , @entity153 crawlers , working with @entity20 to look to curtail this kind of activity			0
' he added : ' i know it sound as if we 're killjoys but we have to protect our intellectual property			0
' @entity4 takes on the pads with trainer @entity195 in front of the watching media meanwhile , @entity11 , which allows users to turn their mobile phones into a portable webcam that lets them live stream whatever their handset is pointing towards , has had its access to some @entity20 services cut			1
@entity20 was not impressed when the app imported all of the user 's followers and details of who they were following and have limited @entity11 's access , although the company has since has found a way around this by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite @entity20 users			2
founder @entity218 claims that while other live video services had been available before , they did not take off because of a lack of network capacity and enough people using smartphones for video			2
' this truly feels like a beginning of a new era , ' @entity226 said			0
@entity156 goals and highlights are already being made illegally available as @entity153 posts nonetheless , @entity10 and @entity11 may not immediately threaten to steal sports broadcasters profits , but they serve as a form of ' grass roots competition , ' said @entity236 , a @entity237 sports economist , told @entity238			1
' streaming apps that allow simultaneous media consumption and production are not in themselves a clear and present danger to sports leagues , ' he added			1
the biggest problem is that watching streamed video from a mobile phone can be a frustrating experience with quality far removed from modern high - definition tv screens - not to mention pop up ads , potential viruses , picture freezes and buffering			2
a @entity20 spokesperson told @entity256 : ' periscope will review all reported broadcasts against its content policy , which expressly prohibits the broadcast of copyright - protected material			0
' after investigation , periscope will take down any reported streams that are deemed to infringing			0
users who are found to be repeat infringers may face account suspension or termination			0
' broadcasters @entity13 and @entity16 in the @entity15 and @entity14 in the @entity269 have bought the rights to the fight , meaning that anyone who streams it in the respective countries will be breaching their copyright			1
individual users may have a legal defence if they show small parts of the fight with credit on their periscope stream , but showing it in its entirety would be illegal			0
the copyright holders would be entitled to bring legal action against those in breach			0
however , due to ephemeral nature of @entity10 - if users choose not to save their broadcast - and the difficulties in tracking down individuals , the likelihood is that broadcasters would choose to bring a lawsuit against @entity10 for facilitating the breach of copyright			2
at the beginning of the 2014/15 season , the @entity156 warned social media users that it was illegal to share clips from games , and claimed it was developing technology to sift through millions of @entity304 and gifs to target those in breach			2
last week @entity16 in the @entity15 issued takedown notices to @entity20 , which owns @entity10 , over the illegal streaming of the season premiere of @entity61			1
in its terms of service , @entity10 encourages anyone with a copyright complaint to come to them , with evidence of the breach			2
it also states : ' we reserve the right to remove content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion			0
in appropriate circumstances , periscope will also terminate a user 's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer			0
