if @entity1 is absent from the shortlists for this season ’s @entity5 awards , @entity0 will surely fire off a stiff missive seeking clarification on the reasons			1
the prospect of a @entity10 evaporated last sunday , an afternoon @entity11 now describes as the worst of his career			2
‘ i sat and stared at the walls , ’ said the @entity13 of the aftermath			0
eight points clear of @entity18 with five games left to play , however , his outlook is suddenly brighter			0
@entity23 's @entity22 ( left ) tussles for possession with @entity0 's @entity26 ( right ) on wednesday night @entity0 's @entity27 ( left ) challenges @entity28 ( right ) during the @entity30 match @entity23 's @entity31 ( left ) and @entity0 's @entity26 ( right ) battle for the ball at @entity33 on wednesday @entity23 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity34 , @entity31 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 69 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 59 ) , @entity31 , @entity28 , @entity43 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 booked : @entity38 , @entity36 scorers : @entity40 87 @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity1 , @entity27 , @entity53 ( @entity54 81 ) , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity26 ( commons 76 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 76 ) subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 scorers : @entity59 32 , @entity1 63 referee : @entity69 attendance : 8 , 908 a fourth successive title looks to be a question of when and not if			1
it could even happen at @entity73 on may 10 , where @entity1 scored the most significant of his impressive 10 - goal haul back in november			1
he was at it again last night , thrashing home his second 20 - yard free - kick in as many games			1
ever the perfectionist , his manager still wants more			0
‘ @entity1 has shown that ability also last season with his free - kicks			1
we can also see it in training , so he has to use it more			0
‘ it became a very good night and we have put ourselves in a very good position			2
eight points ahead with five games to go — and the goal difference as well			0
we just have to keep on performing and putting pressure on @entity18			0
’ last sunday , van @entity1 ’s early strike against @entity95 was overtaken by events			1
here , his thrashing effort past @entity23 keeper @entity34 earned @entity0 the two - goal lead which ultimately repelled a late rally from the hosts			1
@entity102 ’s goal in the 87th minute was too little , too late			1
@entity0 's @entity103 ( top ) jumps over the challenge from @entity23 's @entity37 ( bottom ) @entity0 striker @entity60 ( right ) goes close with an effort on goal against @entity23 on wednesday night @entity0 had claimed the lead in 32 minutes and , with painful predictability , it was laced with more refereeing controversy			1
it was fairly mild stuff in contrast with sunday — and the irony of @entity0 being the beneficiaries here will be lost on no one			1
this is a week when @entity120 referees are destined to be hoist by their own petard			0
a week when every error , minor or major , will be punished to the maximum			0
the row over the @entity126 ’ hand - ball in the @entity128 semi-final defeat rumbles on but there will be no @entity131 postage stamps wasted this time			2
there will be no disputing the free - kick which teed up @entity103 ’s superbly struck opener			1
@entity135 may have other ideas			0
‘ there were some decisions which i thought were quite bizarre , ’ said the @entity23 manager			2
‘ referees are always under pressure but after what ’s happened the last few days , the scrutiny is always going to be on them			0
’ it was @entity69 ’s turn to be placed in football ’s equaivalent of a thumbscrew last night			2
a nondescript 32 minutes had passed without incident or urgency when a promising move by the visitors was interrupted by a barge on @entity59 30 yards from goal			2
it was a free - kick			1
@entity69 , rightly , played a good advantage before @entity60 immediately tripped over the ball and lost possession			0
the loss of the advantage was self - inflicted , yet to howls of derision from the home support , @entity69 pulled the play back for a @entity0 free - kick			1
what came next was inevitable			0
@entity58 thumped a long ball towards the back post , @entity1 headed it firmly across the area and @entity59 gathered on the edge of the box , rasping the ball into the top corner			1
@entity23 ’s sense of injustice was merely compounded by a penalty claim before half - time when @entity27 bumped into @entity28			1
it was n’t a penalty			0
yet manager @entity135 ’s pursuit of the officials reflected a broader frustration with his team			0
afterwards he bemoaned the lack of ‘ cutting edge ’ from his team			0
@entity58 ( right ) is challenged and sent hurtling to the ground by @entity185 at @entity33 @entity59 fires @entity0 into the lead with a cool finish following a snaking run through the @entity23 box against a @entity131 side missing @entity192 and @entity193 , the @entity190 struggled to make inroads until the late @entity40 strike			1
@entity0 were little better in the opening stages			2
the opening goal from @entity59 relaxed them markedly			0
@entity60 was unable to turn the ball back into the net from an acute angle after @entity53 ’s cross was nodded across the face of the goal by @entity26			0
the disputed free - kick changed things			1
with the lead they had cherished , @entity0 seized the game by the scruff of the neck			1
they should have made it two in 43 minutes			2
@entity55 ’s scuffed , mishit shot from the edge of the area fell kindly at the feet of @entity26 in an onside position			0
the winger had time and opportunity to drive it home , but hit an unconvincing effort at just the right height for @entity224 to pluck the ball out of the air			2
@entity27 ’s clash with @entity28 — a nondescript affair unworthy of a spot kick — provoked the ire and frustration of @entity135			2
@entity0 had undeniably enjoyed a break from the referee for their first			2
there could be no real complaints over the free - kick which reaped their second in 63 minutes			1
@entity240 clattered into @entity58 20 yards from goal			0
it was the same proximity as last sunday ’s opener at @entity244 — and the same devastating result			0
like @entity247 for @entity95 , the @entity23 keeper had little or no chance of stopping the @entity1 free - kick which killed the game			1
the @entity251 stepped up and thrashed the ball into the top of the net			2
the game , to all intents and purposes , was done			0
late on , substitute @entity42 miscued from close range after @entity1 made a hash of a downward defensive header , but @entity40 finished in composed fashion with three minutes to play after @entity31 ’s progress down the right flank ended in a low cross			1
‘ it always becomes a little bit more nervy at the end , ’ said a relieved , buoyant @entity11 , ‘ but there were n’t too many chances			0
we were maybe a little bit naive , but we won the game and that was the most important thing			0
’ @entity60 is held off by @entity23 's @entity35 ( right ) during the @entity30 match on wednesday @entity0 defender @entity1 doubles @entity0 's lead with a stunning free - kick against @entity23 at @entity33 @entity275 is mobbed by his team - mates as they celebrate a 2 - 0 lead over @entity23 at @entity33			1

@entity0 beat @entity23 2 - 1 away at @entity33 on wednesday night
the win sees them extend their lead at the top of the @entity30
@entity103 set the @entity285 on their way with a cool first - half finish
@entity1 scored a stunning free - kick in the second - half
@entity102 grabbed a late *consolation* for the home side on 87 minutes
