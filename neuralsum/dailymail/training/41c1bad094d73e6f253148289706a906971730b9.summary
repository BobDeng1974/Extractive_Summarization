@entity23 , senior consignment director of @entity36 - based @entity35 , who are selling the huge haul , said : ' i have watched @entity8 piece together this fantastic collection over the 20 - plus years i have known him			1
' when i saw the collection in its entirety , it was a thing of beauty			2
up for auction : a rare first edition copy of the x-men , which introduced @entity18 and co to the world , alongside an equally rare first edition copy of the @entity17 , featuring @entity20 @entity17 : series 1 - 100 ratings : 89 are 9.8 and 11 are 9.6 daredevil : series 1 - 100rating out of 10 : 90 are 9.8 and 10 are 9.6 fantastic four series : 1 - @entity55 : 94 are between 9.8 and 9.6 @entity56 : series 83 - 125 ratings : 40 are 9.8 and 9.6 @entity58 : series 101 - 168 ratings : 64 are between 9.8 and 9.6 tales of @entity62 39 - 99 ratings : all are 9.8 and 9.6 tales to @entity65 : series : £ 36 - 101 ratings : 64 are between 9.8 and 9.6 @entity68 : series : 126 - 200 ratings : 72 are 9.8 and 3 are 9.6 x-men : series 1 - 66 ratings : 61 are 9.8 and 5 are 9.8 ' we expect there to be a hive of interest in this when bidding starts in july			1
' because of that we have n't set a reserve price , but are expecting the lot to fetch over $ 3million			0
' the collection was painstakingly compiled by mr @entity8 , from @entity29 , @entity79 , by trawling comic stores , online sales and meeting fellow dealers			1
and the news that it is up for sale - with each individual piece on offer - has sent comic fans scrambling to get their hands on one			0
his acquisitions date back to @entity7 's ' @entity92 ' - from 1956 to 1970 - with almost every comic in the set rated as the highest graded copy left in existence , according to the @entity98 census , which registers quality			1
incredibly , despite years of use , most of the comics ' pages are still white or off - white , meaning they have not faded or been damaged since first bought			2
and mr @entity8 , 49 , added : ' i just felt it was time to part with it			2
i 'm going to be 50 soon and i ca n't take them to the grave so i thought i should pass them on and let other people enjoy the great story lines			0
' although i sold the majority of my @entity115 titles when i moved to @entity29 in 2004 , i kept and continued to add to my @entity92 runs , looking for upgrades on any individual issue whenever possible			0
' the formation of this collection has been painstaking and took an incredible amount of effort , time , expense and patience			0
rare copy : also up for sale is an early copy of the @entity15 , featuring @entity127 and @entity128 introducing @entity19 times change : the back cover of all the first edition @entity7 comics featuring an advertisement stating how readers could earn $ 50 - a far cry from its current value of millions in @entity29 ' the stories i could tell you of meeting at diners and post offices in @entity141 , at office buildings and street corners in @entity36 to obtain that missing issue or coveted upgrade would blow your mind			2
' my favourite has to be the 9.8 x-men first edition			0
i love that whole run of comics and to own one in such perfect condition is rare			0
' i sincerely hope the collectors who buy some of my books can enjoy them even half as much as i have			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
