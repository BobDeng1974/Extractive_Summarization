newsflash : striker scores goal and celebrates wildly			2
par for the course usually , but when @entity3 is concerned it warrants observation			1

there are the underlying issues though , which his last comment hints at			0
@entity3 wants to play @entity58 football ; a realistic aim for a striker with 14 goals this season			1
but no bids have come in yet — @entity64 are said to be monitoring the situation , while @entity66 have distanced themselves — and talks initially intended to improve a £ 12,000 - a - week contract are on hold			2
