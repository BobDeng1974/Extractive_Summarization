the ex-wife of @entity1 , the bankrupt property tycoon who fell to his death , is seeking ' a fresh pair of eyes ' to search for the fortune she believes he kept from her during a bitter divorce battle			1
mr @entity1 was jailed for six months for contempt of court during his high - profile matrimonial row with his former partner as she accused him of hiding away more than £ 400million			1
the 52 - year - old fell on to railings outside a luxury flat in @entity14 , @entity15 , central @entity16 , last week in what witnesses described as a ' grisly ' and ' brutal ' scene			1
but first she must pay outstanding costs bills , including those owed to the current joint trustees			0
the judge said ms @entity21 wanted the pair - @entity38 and @entity39 , two partners in professional services firm @entity41 - replaced because they had identified none of the late mr @entity1 's assets			1
the judge said she was also accusing the trustees of ' lacking neutrality and being biased against her '			0
the @entity48 separated in 2006 after starting a relationship in 1989			0
@entity50 , a deputy judge of the @entity52 's chancery division , said ms @entity21 had two daughters with her former husband and was his largest creditor			2
under the 1986 @entity57 , creditors have a democratic right to remove a trustee in bankruptcy at a creditors ' meeting , although the courts can intervene to stop a meeting being convened			0
judge @entity65 said the current trustees had applied for a direction that a meeting should not be convened			0
@entity1 fell on to railings outside a luxury flat in @entity14 , @entity15 , central @entity16 , last week in what witnesses described as a ' grisly ' and ' brutal ' scene ms @entity21 wanted them replaced by @entity75 , from @entity76 , and @entity78 of @entity77			1
the judge said during her divorce proceedings ms @entity21 had changed her solicitors and forensic accountants several times			2
she was now on her 14th firm of solicitors , with her total litigation costs around £ 6.4million			0
the judge said : ' ms @entity21 believed the bankrupt ( mr @entity1 ) to be hiding more than £ 400million and certain well known , exceptionally wealthy people were helping him to conceal his money '			1
he described how @entity52 judge mr @entity90 had found the former husband had retained assets valued at £ 45million , but could not say where they had been secreted			0
judge @entity65 concluded : ' whilst i accept that , in all the circumstances , it is understandable that to date there has been no identification of assets belonging to the bankrupt , and i wholly reject any suggestion of reluctance or intransigence on the part of the joint trustees to identify or recover assets , ms @entity21 is entitled to invite the other creditors to consider replacing the joint trustees with a " fresh pair of eyes "			1
' a letter from the trustees had indicated no appetite for change , but ms @entity21 should have the chance to put her case , said the judge			2
however , the meeting would not take place until she had paid outstanding costs orders in relation to ' unnecessary and hopeless ' applications she had made to stay or annul the bankruptcy , plus the additional costs for a document production exercise carried out by the joint trustees .			0
