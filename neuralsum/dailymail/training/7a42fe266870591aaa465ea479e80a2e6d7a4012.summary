@entity0 were defeated 5 - 2 by @entity1 in the seven - match one - day series and , in truth , very few players have done their @entity6 chances much good			1
@entity7 was the star for the tourists but that was not much of a contest , so bad were many of his team - mates			1
with the squad for the @entity6 being announced on saturday , @entity12 assess the @entity0 players who appeared in @entity1 ( highest rated top )			1
@entity7 , on his way to 80 in @entity18 , was @entity0 's best player during their tour of @entity1 8 @entity7 ( games 7 ; batting average 73.40 ; 1 wicket at 110 ) @entity0 ’s best @entity23 batsman in the summer , and their best one - day batsman here			1
match - winning century in @entity26 was a masterpiece of timing and good sense			2
7 @entity30 ( games 4 ; average 42.50 ) @entity35 twice , using his feet superbly to the spinners , and running like a hare			1
but it took @entity0 until the fourth game to pick him , and he faded			1
7 @entity39 ( games 7 ; average 33.71 ; 5 wickets at 63.80 ) no one struck the ball more sweetly			1
there were failures , especially against @entity47 ’s off - breaks , but his 12 sixes were nine more than anyone else , and his strike - rate was 123			2
useful off - spin too			2
@entity30 shone in two matches , while @entity39 hit more sixes than any other @entity0 batsman 7 @entity54 ( games 5 ; average 17.00 ; 4 wickets at 54.75 ) @entity0 ’s tightest bowler was unlucky to miss out on a turning @entity18 pitch for the fourth match			1
but pitches at the @entity6 wo n’t suit him			0
6 @entity61 ( games 6 ; average 30.83 ; 1 wicket at 82.00 ) began with two fifties and was promoted to no 5 , as he wanted			0
but he reverted to his frustrating ways			0
should have bowled more than 15 overs			0
6 @entity67 ( games 5 ; average 1.66 ; 10 wickets at 26.00 ) his accuracy and rhythm showed odd signs of improvement , and @entity74 wants him at the @entity6			1
his slip - catching and potential with the bat could count in his favour			2
6 @entity78 ( games 7 ; average 20.60 ; 14 wickets at 25.28 ) confirmed his extra bite with the ball , and collected six - for in the win at @entity26			0
expensive at times , but may have overtaken @entity85			0
@entity86 salutes after taking the fifth of his six wickets in the victory at @entity26 5 @entity90 ( games 2 ; average 23.00 ) dropped for @entity92 after two games			0
may have to concentrate on @entity23 from now on			0
5 @entity94 ( games 7 ; average 29.00 ) finished off the run - chase in @entity97 , but his keeping grew scruffier as the tour progressed			1
@entity0 need to manage him carefully			1
5 @entity85 ( games 5 ; average 2.00 ; 5 wickets at 43.80 ) heartening to see him take the new ball after his woes last winter , but did n't offer @entity0 enough early breakthroughs			2
3 @entity74 ( games 6 ; average 19.83 ) barely a day went by when the question of his captaincy did n’t overshadow everything else			1
his strike - rate was a relic - like 67			0
@entity74 shows the strain after another ordinary performance with the bat in defeat 3 @entity92 ( games 3 ; average 11.33 ) given only three chances , but took none of them			1
a frustrated figure for much of the tour			0
3 @entity124 ( games 3 ; average 8.00 ; 1 wicket at 158.00 ) one wicket for 158 in three games , and shaky in the field			0
will be lucky to make @entity6 squad			0
3 @entity131 ( games 7 ; average 12.85 ) produced only one innings of substance – when he was standing in as captain for the banned @entity74 in the fourth game			1
averaged less than five otherwise			0
2 @entity139 ( games 3 ; average 11.00 ; 0 wickets ) utterly devoid of confidence , with both bat and ball			2
the @entity145 seem a long time ago			0
@entity139 ' confidence with both bat and ball has gone through the floor			2

@entity7 was @entity0 's best batsman throughout the one - day series
@entity30 *briefly* shone and @entity39 was the best six hitter
@entity0 need to manage @entity94 more carefully
questions surrounding @entity74 overshadowed the tour
@entity131 and @entity139 really *struggled* during defeat by @entity1
