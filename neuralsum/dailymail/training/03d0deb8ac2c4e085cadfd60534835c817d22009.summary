dogs have been man ’s best friends for 30,000 years - and now scientist think they know why			0
canines respond to emotions in the voice in the same way that humans do , research shows			2
the first study to compare the brains of humans with any nonprimate animal shows that dogs have dedicated voice areas in their brains , just as people do			2
not a @entity19 scan : @entity21 scientists have shown that that dogs have dedicated voice areas in their brains , just as people do			1
here the dogs are pictured after their time in the @entity26 scanner recent research suggests what dog owners knew all along – that they do in fact experience feelings of love and affection			2
scientists at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , discovered that a part of the brain associated with positive emotions , is similar in dogs and humans			1
they too used @entity26 scanners to examine canine brain activity			0
using hand signals to indicate the dogs were about to receive a food treat , the researchers showed that the caudate nucleus , a part of the brain associated with positive emotions , was similar in dogs and humans			1
if , as many scientists have argued in the past , it is all simply about [ getting ] food for dogs then the reaction in their brains would be the same no matter who or what is offering them the food , ’ said neuroscientist @entity61			1
‘ we hope to show that they love us for things far beyond food , basically the same things that humans love us for , like social comfort and social bonds			0
’ crucially , dog brains respond to acoustic cues of emotion in the same way as people			1
@entity75 , leader of the @entity21 research group which carried out the study , said : ‘ dogs and humans share a similar social environment			1
‘ our findings suggest that they also use similar brain mechanisms to process social information			1
‘ this may support the successfulness of vocal communication between the two species			0
’ the research , published in the journal @entity89 , suggests that voice areas evolved 100 million years ago , the age of the last common ancestor of humans and dogs			2
canines were first domesticated by humans in @entity98 up to 32,000 years ago , scientists think			2
genetic evidence discovered last year suggests the wolf ancestors of today ’s dogs were most likely tamed by hunter - gatherers			0
for the latest study , dr @entity75 and his colleagues trained 11 dogs to lay motionless in an @entity26 brain scanner			0
that made it possible to run the same neuroimaging experiment on both dog and human participants - something that had never been done before			0
in the experiment , scientists captured both dogs ' and humans ' brain activities while the subjects listened to nearly 200 dog and human sounds , ranging from whining or crying to playful barking or laughing @entity123 @entity122 ( r ) talks to @entity124 , a @entity125 , before an examination as part of the project they captured both dog and human brain activities while the subjects listened to 200 dog and human sounds , ranging from whining or crying to playful barking or laughing			1
the findings show that dog and human brains include voice areas in similar locations in the brain			1
dogs still responded more strongly to other dogs , while humans responded more strongly to other humans , but there were striking similarities in the ways the dog and human brains reacted to those of the other species			1
dr @entity75 said : ‘ this method offers a totally new way of investigating neural processing in dogs			0
‘ at last we begin to understand how our best friend is looking at us and navigating in our social environment			0
’ @entity158 , a @entity159 , about to go in a mri scanner in a neurology clinic in @entity162 @entity124 , a @entity125 , wearing a special headset and headgear maverick the @entity159			0
researchers developed dog training methods to make them lay motionless in mri machines .			0

scientists found that dogs use similar brain mechanisms to humans to process social information
@entity21 researchers captured both dogs ' and humans ' brain activities while they listened to 200 dog and human sounds
they found canines ’ brains are *sensitive* to acoustic cues of emotio , just like humans
