by @entity1 reporter published : 10:51 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 : 10:52 est , 6 february 2014 ' @entity4 ' : @entity6 right - wing politician @entity5 is campaigning for the @entity6 to leave the @entity7 and the monetary union the @entity6 would be better off if it left the @entity7 and the single currency , a new study claims			1
the figures have been put forward by @entity5 , the leader of the @entity6 far - right @entity12 as part of his campaign ' @entity4 ' ahead of the @entity16 parliamentary elections in may			1
the study claims each @entity6 household would benefit by nearly £ 8,000 a year and national income will grow by over £ 1 trillion if @entity5 's ‘ @entity4 ’ – a play on the @entity6 and the word ‘ exit ’ - becomes reality			1
the @entity6 government rejects @entity5 ' views , saying a pullout from the @entity7 would cause irreparable damage to trade relations in a country heavily reliant on trade , and a euro departure would lead to a new financial crisis			1
‘ i can not explain to any voters in the @entity6 that we have to raise taxes , cut health care for the elderly , for example , but that we send billions of euros to the @entity16 countries ( for bailouts ) , or all the fees we pay to @entity45 , ’ @entity5 said at a press conference outside @entity6 parliament			1
at the press conference , @entity5 presented a study that concluded there would be significant positive economic effects from leaving the @entity7			1
he commissioned the study from the @entity50 - based think - tank @entity49 , founded by the @entity52 economist @entity51			2
the study concluded that @entity6 national income could increase by as much as £ 1.3 trillion ( € 1,500 billion ) by 2035 , bringing new wealth equivalent to between £ 8,134 per household each year			1
on a per - capita basis , the @entity6 are among the highest net contributors to the @entity7			1
second , leaving the euro would enable the @entity6 central bank to tailor monetary policy to better suit the country , @entity49 analyst @entity57 said			2
‘ we think the @entity63 option is viable for the @entity6 , ’ @entity57 said , referring to @entity63 's good bilateral relations and trade with the @entity7 , even as it conducts its own monetary policy			2
it is not clear that the @entity6 would be able to negotiate the same deals @entity63 has			0
many would find it difficult to imagine the @entity7 without the @entity6 , one of its founding members and traditionally a strong supporter of the union			2
the study by @entity50 - based think - tank @entity49 , claims each @entity6 household would benefit by nearly £ 8,000 a year and national income will grow by over £ 1 trillion but @entity5 called the report 's result ‘ the best news for the @entity6 in years			1
’ ‘ it offers the @entity6 a way out of this crisis , ’ he said			0
the report was met with scepticism , with the country ’s finance minister and chairman of eurozone meetings , @entity92 , saying he would read the report but that leaving the @entity7 and the euro would be ‘ very unwise			0
‘ @entity6 is an economic powerhouse in @entity97			0
we earn the bulk of our wealth in trade with @entity7 countries so @entity6 has lots of interest in an internal market with easy trade , ’ he said told the @entity95			2
‘ there is also the single currency			0
this is very strong at present and the state of the eurozone looks a lot better than a few years ago			0
there is no reason to take us into new adventures			0
i would be very against			0
’ @entity115 has scarcely grown since the start of the 2008 financial crisis , due in part to a sharp fall in housing prices , though most economists forecast a modest return to growth in 2014			0
unemployment is around 7 per cent and rising , and many @entity6 are unhappy with the government 's austerity policies , after years of painful spending cuts and tax hikes .			0

study shows the @entity6 ' would be better off outside @entity7 and euro '
figures put forward by @entity52 right - wing politician @entity5
every @entity6 household better off by £ 8,000 per year outside @entity7 , study say
