by @entity0 published : 17:49 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 5 june 2013 older versions of @entity3 products - including the @entity4 and the @entity5 and @entity5 3g models - have been banned in the @entity7 after an official ruling claimed the devices breach @entity11 patents			1
the devices are assembled in @entity12 and because the ruling by the @entity14 in @entity15 bans imports of affected @entity3 products into @entity7 , these devices could be removed from the shelves as early as august			1
@entity3 has been given 60 days to stop selling the products but is appealing the decision , which ruled that @entity3 copied @entity11 's 3g technology in its devices			1
banned : the @entity4 , seen here on the right , along with the older model , the @entity24 on the left , can not be imported to the @entity7 anymore , a trade panel ruled tuesday @entity3 initially sued @entity11 in april 2011 for infringing seven utility patents , three design patents , three registered trade dresses and six trademarked icons with its @entity34 line of products , including the @entity37 smartphone and the @entity39 tablet			1
@entity11 responded later that month by suing @entity3 for infringing five patents in @entity41 , two in @entity42 and three in @entity43			2
the companies have then continued to sue and countersue each other since			0
this latest ruling from the @entity47 on tuesday actually overturned a previous ruling in the same case which claimed @entity3 had n't breached patents			2
the new ruling followed an appeal by @entity11 and is considered a ' final ' ruling , although @entity3 can appeal and president @entity54 could overturn it			1
in a separate patent dispute in @entity7 federal court last year , @entity11 was ordered to pay £ 652m ( $ 1bn ) for patent infringement , an award that was later slashed to £ 390m ( $ 598.9m )			2
@entity11 then won a patent dispute on the @entity39 against @entity3 in the @entity60 in october			0
judge @entity61 stated that @entity11 's tablets were ' not as cool ' as the @entity3 's , and ' do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the @entity3 design			1
' all import bans also have to be validated by president @entity54 and he has 60 days to invalidate the order			1
the @entity14 in @entity15 issued the final ruling on tuesday in one @entity11 's suits against @entity3			1
the panel issued a limited import ban and a cease - and - desist order for @entity73 models of the @entity4 , @entity24 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
the versions targeted are more than a year old but are still solid sellers , @entity76 reported			0
@entity11 and @entity3 are engaged in a global legal battle over their smartphones , with @entity3 arguing that @entity11 and its @entity82 phones copy vital features of the @entity4			2
@entity11 is fighting back with its own complaints			0
the @entity4 was launched in 2010 and is the oldest iphone still being made			0
it 's the second bad court ruling for @entity3 in as many weeks			0
a preliminary class settlement which agrees to pay $ 53 million in refunds to @entity4 and @entity89 customers for voiding their warranties was filed on tuesday by @entity3 in the @entity93 of @entity94 in @entity95			0
the settlement would refund up to $ 200 to each customer who was denied repairs or replacement under warranty of their @entity4 or @entity89 because a small red strip located on the outside of the device indicated that they had been in contact with water			0
not for sale : the ruling also states the @entity74 and @entity75 can not be imported as well because they violate a patent held by @entity11 @entity112 , an attorney representing two of the four representatives of the class action , told @entity116 that @entity3 refused to honor standard warranties and @entity118 if a white indicator strip near the headphone or charging jacks had turned pink or red			1
but 3m,the company that makes the strip ( called ' @entity125 ' ) said humidity alone could have caused the color of strips to turn pink or even red			0
this meant that a customer who took an @entity4 or @entity5 for repair would have their warranty voided if the liquid indicator strip was red - even if it had never been in contact with water .			0

@entity3 's @entity4 models and 4 and @entity140 and @entity75 can not be imported into the @entity7 because they violate patents of rival @entity11
the *electronics* are made in @entity12 , *effectively* ending their sales in the @entity7
@entity3 plans to appeal the ruling by the @entity7 @entity14
president @entity54 has 60 days to invalidate the ruling
