@entity134 joked : i 'd already packed my bags ! ' beforehand : @entity1 chats to the show 's presenters before the elimination and discusses when she was also voted off in series five in the same week when it was time for the next three couples to be told if they were safe , @entity148 plugged her ears and could n't believe it when she found out she would be dancing next week			0
essentially the five lowest scoring couples were safe and one of the judge 's three favourites acts was going to go home			0

pros : the performance was accompanied by a display from pro dancers @entity176 and @entity175 and if she was sad about her very recent break - up with @entity188 , 18 , she certainly did n't show it			1
