by @entity0 for six months , @entity1 have thought of little else but this			1
the fraught process of qualifying for the group stage of the @entity7 begins under the low clouds of @entity9 on tuesday evening			1
few expect @entity11 to be the toughest test @entity14 ’s champions will encounter en route to the rich man ’s playground which is worth an annual £ 15million			1
were qualification down to dressing room iq , however , @entity11 would be favourites			1
one of their players is a banker , another an architect and most of the others are students			1
but the capacity of their @entity27 — a glorified public park — is just 1,700			1
yet such is the importance of @entity49 ’s blue - riband tournament in terms of prestige , interest and cold , hard cash , the @entity46 side can take nothing for granted			2
under @entity56 , this @entity1 team displayed a knack for defusing awkward , unappealing ties			1
but @entity56 has now gone , @entity60 talisman @entity59 has followed suit and the captain , @entity62 , is out injured until october			2
as yet , their only new signing has been goalkeeper @entity65 , who has n’t kicked a ball for two years			2
facing the press : @entity69 and @entity30 chat to the media ahead of @entity7 qualifier for @entity1 , these games are now like a high - stakes round of @entity75 roulette			1
and no one can predict if it will blow up in their face			2
and no one knows yet what @entity30 can bring to this team , to this club			1
he will certainly bring his own players after the @entity11 ties			1
and his first competitive test could certainly be stiffer			0
but its importance and significance is hard to overstate			0
as domestic football becomes more mundane , the @entity7 is now what sustains @entity1			1
with their home games to be staged at @entity93 while @entity46 serves as a host venue for the @entity95 , the @entity41 could use a big statement in the @entity9 capital			1
@entity100 ’s @entity99 striker @entity98 claims , with a slightly ridiculous level of mathematical precision , that the @entity104 champions are ‘ seven per cent ’ weaker than last term			0
adversaries : @entity30 ( right ) speaks to @entity11 counterpart @entity37 ahead of tuesday 's match from @entity69 , last season ’s @entity1 player of the year , that prompts a snort of derision			1
‘ if the @entity11 player has come out and said we ’re weaker this year , then he ’s obviously concentrating more on us than his own team , ’ said the former @entity14 international			1
‘ he ’s probably hoping that we ’ll be weaker			0
but over the course of two games , if we ’re at it , we should have more than enough to get through			0
‘ but they ’re like cup finals with everything on the line — so you just never know			0
‘ the @entity60 nights at home are some of the best in the world			0
that ’s what drives you			0
‘ when you ’ve reached the top and you ’ve had those nights , it ’s not the same just playing every week in the @entity133			0
you need those @entity7 games in between			1
‘ that gives you the buzz , it ’s what brings the fans and the money in			2
‘ to have that for the last two years , it would be devastating not to have it this time around			0
’ focused : commons is determined to help seal @entity1 's qualification to the @entity7 group stages this , for @entity1 , is the key			1
sometimes , the finances make the headlines as if that ’s all that matters			2
in a domestic environment where broadcasting revenue is derisory , it ’s certainly vital but the @entity7 means more to fans of @entity1 than filthy lucre			1
the @entity60 nights are what they live for			0
they know they will never win another @entity7 , but being there , mixing with the elite , is what sets the pulse racing			1
if they inflict the odd bloody nose on a major scalp along the way , all the better			0
‘ we ’re fully focused on the job that needs to be done , ’ added @entity69			0
‘ we know what to expect			0
‘ everyone knows how vital these games are , not just for the club but for the whole of @entity14 — it ’s important that we get into the @entity7			1
‘ we know what we ’re carrying on our shoulders			0
we have to get in there			0
@entity11 are 11 games into their season , so they ’ll have more match - fitness than us			1
last game ? @entity180 has been linked with a move away from @entity46 this summer ‘ but once the whistle goes , you put your professional head on and get to where you need to be as soon as possible			0
‘ the players have thought about these qualifiers all summer			2
they either make or break our season			2
‘ we can either have a really good campaign up until december , january time — or we ’re going to be toddling through the season			0
‘ for a club like @entity1 , we need to have @entity60 football			1
we need those special nights at @entity46 to keep everyone interested			0
’ last season , the group stage was a fairly joyless experience when the sale of key players came home to roost			2
out to impress : @entity35 controls the ball with his shin in front of assistant coach @entity204 fears remain that @entity180 or @entity206 — or both — could be sold after the @entity11 ties			1
that concern was critical to @entity56 ’s decision to quit and for @entity30 poses a significant threat to his hopes of a smooth passage into the job			1
yet @entity69 points to the streetwise players left behind who almost manage themselves these days			0
what @entity56 called his ‘ hard core ’ of him , @entity218 , @entity62 , @entity219 and @entity220			0
‘ we have a new boss — but , in these games , we almost have to manage it ourselves because we ’ve been over the course before , ’ he said			2
‘ i think we ’ve proved we can deal with teams like @entity11			1
recently , we ’ve been right on the money apart from the @entity228 away game			0
‘ over there , we played well and created chances but we did n’t deal with long throws and that cost us two goals			0
‘ @entity235 was a fright , we almost did n’t make the group stage			1
now , you can almost touch it , you can feel it			0
’ big job : @entity1 fans expect new boss @entity30 to secure their passage to the group stages it remains to be seen if this is a club which has learned anything from that @entity235 experience			1
a last - minute @entity248 goal pulled them through after key players — @entity56 ’s ‘ crown jewels ’ of @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 – — were sold			0
@entity30 knows the type of players he needs to play the kind of game he has in mind			2
whether he receives the resources to get them will depend to a huge extent on steady progress in these qualifying games			0
‘ the new manager has been super , i ’ve been really impressed , ’ added @entity69			0
‘ he ’s got a great knowledge			0
‘ he wants us to be in the @entity7 and to win the title by a country mile , rather than just getting over the line			2
’ from this vantage point , crawling over the line would do @entity1 fine			2
a confident stride from the blocks on tuesday evening would help get things moving .			1

@entity1 boss @entity30 and his side begin their @entity7 qualifiers in @entity9 on tuesday evening
*kr* boast a banker , architect and a collection of students in their side
the @entity27 in @entity11 can hold just 1,700 fans
if @entity1 make it through to the group stages it will be worth £ 15m
