the average time he spends peeling one apple is approximately five seconds and he flies through about half a dozen apples in just over 33 seconds			1
the man dumps the large peels into a nearby bucket as he finishes peeling each apple			1
the restaurant owner can also be heard telling a woman who filmed the footage to ' show them how long the peels are '			0
the speedy worker stretches out one of the peels and to show it reaching about two feet long			0
the man holds the power drill in his left hand and inserts it into the apple			2
