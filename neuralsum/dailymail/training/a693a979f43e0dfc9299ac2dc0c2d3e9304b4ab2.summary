' the scan confirmed that i 'd gone the whole way through the menopause already , and i was no longer producing eggs			2
' i 'd been on the pill for several years so had no way of knowing when the change had happened			2
i was desperate for children , but i was told there was no chance of having my own biological child			1
' the couple were not eligible for @entity70 funding - but she vowed to do whatever it took to become a mother			1

having @entity12 really put pressure on our relationship , ' she told @entity118			1

we ’d been together since we were kids and at that age we did n’t know any different			0
' we were very different people as we grew up that started to show			0

i 'd lost pregnancies during treatment before and part of me knew that this round was doomed to failure too			2

we were over the moon			0
having been through so much over the years , i was simply overjoyed			2

now i want as many people as possible to know about it , because i know there are thousands of other women out there who are in the same position as i was			0
