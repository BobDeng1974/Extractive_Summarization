by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 08:05 est , 4 october 2012 this is the white - knuckle moment a boat was nearly flipped over when its crew faced a huge 35ft wave head - on			1
the 38ft pilot vessel was picked up by the enormous roller off the @entity8 coast and teetered at a perilous 60 - degree angle before coming down safely on the other side			1
it took all the skill of helmsman @entity13 to keep the vessel square on to the wave			1
had he been even slightly off course his craft would have capsized			0
on the edge : incredible images show a pilot vessel put through its paces off the @entity8 coast incredibly , the crew deliberately took to sea during the force 10 storm in order to put the pilot vessel through its paces			1
' pilots ' are experienced sailors who use their knowledge of local waters to guide large ships into and out of port			1
pilot boats have existed in various forms for centuries , as a means of transporting pilots between the shore and incoming ships			1
they need to be able to withstand the very worst weather to guide other ships to safety			2
many also serve as search - and - rescue vessels			2
@entity44 down the hatches ! the 38 - foot vessel is dwarfed by the approaching roller nerves of steel : @entity50 used all his skill to keep the boat at right - angles to the wave engulfed : the vessel is nearly swamped as it surges through the heavy sea the images - compared by some to scenes out of the @entity61 movie the @entity62 - were captured on camera by @entity64			1
mr @entity64 runs a pilot vessel supply company and was on another larger boat that tackled the same wave seconds after he took the pictures in the @entity69			1
mr @entity64 , 50 , said : ' we supply many vessels to @entity73 and @entity74 ports that are open to large biscay swells and are expected to withstand such severe conditions			0
' although it was a bad day weather wise it was a good opportunity to see how this @entity79 model performed			0
' it was critical for @entity13 to be absolutely square on to that wave and a great deal of skill and care was required to keep it that way			2
' in those extreme conditions it would have been easy to make a mistake and expose her beam to the big breaker and risk being capsized			0
white - knuckle ride : the boat 's bow points skywards breaks through the crest of the wave uncertain : teetering for a split - second , the craft could have fallen forward or back relief : the resilient boat crests the wave and regains its balance ' @entity105 is in fact self - righting but we were nâ€™t looking to put it through that test on this day			2
' i was stood on the bow of a larger boat behind it taking some photos			0
' the vessel was in the right position for long enough for me to get a couple of good shots			0
like in the movies : @entity64 's photos have been compared to @entity61 disaster movie @entity122 ( pictured ) ' it must have been at an angle of 60 degrees and would have been like riding a thrill ride for @entity13			0
' many people who i have showed the pictures to have said it looks like something out of the @entity62			0
' mr @entity64 runs @entity131 out of @entity133 harbour .			0

helmsman @entity135 was putting vessel through its paces off @entity8
had to hit the wave head - on to avoid capsizing
pilot boats guide ships into port and are used in rescue operations
