the @entity0 will have its most female - heavy crew in years as when @entity3 's first female astronaut joins the vessel this weekend			1
@entity5 , 37 , will launch into space from a facility in @entity8 this sunday , where she will join @entity10 @entity9 , who has been in orbit since september			1
it will only be the second time that two women have been on board the @entity0 at once , making the six - member crew one third female			1
space - bound : @entity5 , posing above with the spacesuit she will wear , is @entity3 's first female astronaut companion : @entity9 , a @entity10 , is already in orbit on the @entity0			1
@entity5 's arrival will make the crew more women - heavy than it has been since 2010 @entity5 's arrival will also bring a new first to space , as she will bring a specially - designed @entity3 espresso machine along with her			1
the so - called @entity29 machine , which weighs 44lbs , is designed to work in zero gravity , and will be the first device of its kind outside the earth 's atmosphere , the @entity27 reported			2
a joint statement from coffee company @entity37 and space - food makers @entity35 said @entity5 : ' will be not only the first female astronaut from @entity3 to go into space , but also the very first astronaut in the history of the conquest of space to savor an authentic @entity3 espresso in orbit '			1
she will take just 20 capsules with her , but more can be sent up if the machine proves popular			0
@entity5 's expedition has not been attended by looming questions of gender , unlike that of @entity9 , who found herself quizzed on her hair and make - up decisions by @entity10 media			1
proud : @entity5 , 37 , was a highly - decorated military pilot before she joined the @entity55 ' @entity56 is what i do for work , and that 's what i think about it : it 's my work , ' @entity9 said in a @entity64 interview before launch in late september			1
@entity10 reporters asked if she was taking up makeup and wondered how she would wear her hair during her six - month mission			2
@entity9 ignored the makeup question			2
as for her hairdo , she shot back : ' i have a question for you — why do n't you ask the question about @entity76 's hair , for example , ' she said , referring to crewmate @entity78 seated next to her at the news conference			0
' i 'm sorry , this is my answer			0
more questions ? ' both @entity9 and @entity5 will spend six months aboard the 260 - mile - high complex , following in the footsteps of nine @entity85 women who logged lengthy stays			1
two of those @entity85 women shared the place in 2010 , with four men			2
another two women rose to station commander rank			0
@entity5 is the first woman assigned to a lengthy space station mission by the @entity55 , which recently masterminded the @entity95 rover landing on a comet			1
@entity9 is one of only four @entity10 women to fly in space and the first to live at this space station			1
it was 1963 when @entity10 launched the world 's first spacewoman , @entity101 , beating @entity85 by two full decades , and 1984 when it flew the first world 's female spacewalker , @entity103			0
that 's my ride : @entity5 , and her espresso machine , will be carried into space by a @entity10 @entity111 booster rocket , pictured above at its launchpad in @entity8 @entity9 and @entity5 's joint flight comes as @entity85 medical researchers take an updated look at gender differences in space			1
with space station missions spanning a half - year and expected to last considerably longer on trips to @entity121 , @entity64 wants to make sure all astronauts — male and female alike — stay safe and healthy			2
this month , the @entity123 published a series of studies on the impact of gender on adapting to space			0
it turns out that women tend to suffer more faintness when trying to stand upon immediate return to @entity133 and also more vertigo , according to the report , and they appear to lose more blood plasma during spaceflight			0
male astronauts seem to suffer more vision impairment due to intracranial pressure in orbit than women , although the difference is not statistically significant given the small number of subjects , researchers noted			0
there also are concerns about astronauts ' reproductive health stemming from space radiation as well as weightlessness			0
' many questions remain unanswered , ' the executive summary concluded			0
dr. @entity155 , an endocrinologist who serves as a government science adviser , said in an accompanying commentary that the findings can still be useful in shaping health - related policies and procedures			0
@entity155 and the other authors and researchers — representing @entity64 , the @entity164 in @entity165 and various universities — recommend that more women fly in space , and more astronauts of both genders participate as test subjects			2
that will be challenging given the overwhelming number of male astronauts			0
of @entity64 's 43 current active astronauts , 11 are women .			0

@entity5 , 37 , will join crew of @entity0 this sunday
will be sent into space with other members on rocket in @entity8
her arrival will mark first time since 2010 two women have been on board
@entity9 went up in september , after being *hassled* about make - up
in @entity3 style , @entity5 will take first space - ready espresso maker along
