head coach @entity14 has hinted that @entity15 could even make the 18 for sunday 's @entity17 fixture against @entity18 at @entity19 , and while the @entity21 has not ruled that out , his sights are set the @entity24 ' visit to @entity25 on the following weekend			1
@entity2 playmaker @entity0 is hopeful of returning to the first - team before the end of the season he told @entity29 : ' i do n't think i could play 90 minutes in the coming weeks , so it will be maybe as a substitute at the end of the game , but i do n't know if i will be on the bench ... we have n't discussed yet when i 'll be back			1
' but i hope @entity3 - i do n't know yet if @entity18 would be a good time , but i hope to be back on the bench against @entity3 , depending on how it goes in the coming days and depending on how i feel tomorrow after today			0
' we 'll see how it goes			0
i still have to get a little bit stronger , a little bit more explosive , a little faster , and hopefully i can work on that in the coming days			0
' @entity15 , a £ 6million summer signing from @entity43 , has made just three senior appearances for the club , the last of them in a 3 - 3 home draw with @entity47 on august 30 last year - his only league start to date			1
the summer signing has been plagued by injuries since arriving from @entity43 but is close to full fitness injury hit when he badly tore a thigh muscle in training days later and was sidelined until february , when disaster struck once again as he suffered a collapsed lung for the second time in his career			1
he took the first tentative steps towards a first - team return at @entity19 on wednesday evening , and while he knows there is more hard work to be done , he is glad to be back and already looking towards the start of next season			2
@entity15 said : ' i have n't repaid the fans a lot this season , so i hope to be playing a couple of games , maybe , at the end of the season			2
' but i have to focus on next season and be really fit then and hopefully i can show the fans what i can do , and show myself and show my team - mates what i can do			0
