a pro version is ' coming soon ' that will have more themes hmm nice damn nice oh cool lol thks oh damn @entity54 thks it is the latest in a long line of apps and products designed to tap into the growing trend of people replacing conversations with acronyms , emojis and shortcuts			1
last month , for example , developers created a keyboard cover that turns every key of a @entity70 board into an emoji			2
once installed , the @entity73 key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to @entity79 posts , tweets and even official documents			2
the @entity82 and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at @entity88 - based @entity87			1
the @entity82 and its custom software were recently developed by a team of designers at @entity88 - based @entity87			1
once installed , the @entity73 key lets users switch between regular and the emoji keys meaning people can easily add the small images to @entity79 posts , tweets and even official documents each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust and dirt			2
they come in two sizes - one for standard @entity105 , which includes the 13 - inch and 15 - inch @entity106 , the @entity107 13 and the @entity70 keyboard ( pictured ) , and one for the 11 - inch @entity107 the team has set up a @entity111 campaign to fund production of at least 1,000 covers , but hopes to be able to mass produce them by the end of the year			0
and last year a pair of @entity118 - based developers created the @entity120 app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images			1
even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons			0
and with the release of @entity127 8 @entity70 allowed app developers to create emoji - based keyboards for @entity130 , @entity131 and iphones			1
a study in april last year found that the top trending word , at that time , was emoji			0
there are now apps dedicated to the small images			0
@entity139 , for example , ( pictured ) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures , and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons emoji were originally popular in @entity146 , and widely used online			2
however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere			0
originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ' picture ' ( e ) + ' letter ' ( moji )			0
icons are standardised and include some specific to @entity154 culture , such as a bowing ( apologising ) businessman , a face wearing a face mask , a white flower used to denote ' brilliant homework ' or a group of emoji representing popular foods : ramen noodles , dango , onigiri , @entity154 curry , and sushi			0
some emoji character sets have been incorporated into @entity169 , allowing them to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as @entity79 and @entity172 .			0
