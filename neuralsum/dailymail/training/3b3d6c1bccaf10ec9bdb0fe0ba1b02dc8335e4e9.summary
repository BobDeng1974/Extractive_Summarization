@entity0 are diseased and corrupt			0
these monsters always get away with it ... the @entity4 corruption saga took another twist on tuesday night when football ’s world governing body lodged a criminal complaint in @entity9 over the misconduct of certain unnamed individuals			1
it follows the recommendation of ethics judge @entity14 to @entity0 president @entity15 that the shadowy international transfer of assets to @entity9 in isolated cases was serious enough to be reported to the @entity19 in @entity20			1
the decision by @entity14 , chairman of @entity0 ’s ethics adjudicatory chamber , comes less than a week after his summary of colleague @entity27 ’s investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes , which took nearly two years , was widely discredited as a ‘ whitewash ’			1
@entity0 president @entity15 announces @entity30 as the hosts for the @entity32 in december 2010 @entity27 ( left ) and @entity33 have been tarnished by @entity0 's probe into the @entity4 vote the report was also disowned by @entity27 , who is taking his case of misrepresentation to the @entity0 appeals committee			1
@entity14 ’s conclusions ridiculously apportioned a lot of the blame to @entity44 ’s doomed 2018 bid that gleaned only two votes			0
but there was no suggestion even in his skewed findings that @entity44 ’s bid team had illegally transferred assets into @entity9			0
@entity27 ( left ) , former @entity54 attorney for @entity55 and @entity14 ( right ) , the @entity52 judge football 's world governing body has come under enormous scrutiny after its handling of the @entity4 vote and although @entity0 would not speculate , the only conclusion to be drawn is that the criminal complaints allegedly involve @entity0 ’s two former executive committee rogues - @entity63 and @entity64			1
both are outside football ’s jurisdiction with @entity63 , almost omnipresent in incidents of @entity4 bid - related corruption , having resigned all his positions in the game and @entity64 having been banned for life after his cash - for - votes attempt to bribe his way to the @entity0 presidency			2
@entity14 also reiterated , to @entity0 ’s website , that @entity78 and @entity30 are clear to host the next two @entity79 , adding ‘ there was insufficient clear evidence of illegal or irregular conduct that would call into question the integrity of the award process ’			1
@entity15 has served four terms as @entity0 president and is set to stand for a fifth next year the @entity88 which will be built for the @entity32 in the state of @entity30 @entity15 ( right ) hands the @entity4 to @entity30 's sheik @entity90 @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 look dejected as @entity44 miss out on hosting the 2018 @entity4 @entity91 ( left ) and prince @entity94 look distressed after @entity44 's @entity4 2018 bid fails an artist 's impression of the @entity98 , which will host several @entity4 matche locals celebrate in @entity98 after the announcement that @entity30 will host the @entity32 @entity91 shakes hands with @entity15 and hands over @entity44 's ill - fated @entity4 2018 bid book the fall - out has been extensive since @entity0 on thursday published a report investigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity79			1
here are the events since the release of a 42 - page report by @entity52 judge @entity14 , chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of @entity0 's independent ethics committee , in his ruling on @entity27 's investigation			1
november 12 , 2014 @entity0 announces the initial findings of the investigation into the bidding process for the next two @entity79 will be published on thursday morning , with @entity44 expected to come in for some criticism for the attempt to woo former @entity0 vice-president @entity63			2
november 13 @entity44 are indeed condemned for rules violations in their bid for the 2018 tournament , but @entity78 and @entity30 are effectively confirmed as hosts for 2018 and 2022 respectively , the report stating any rule breaches by them were ' of very limited scope '			2
the @entity128 rejects ' any criticism ' of @entity44 's bid , with a spokesman saying : ' we conducted a transparent bid and , as the report demonstrates with its reference to the @entity44 bid team 's ' full and valuable co-operation ' , willingly complied with the investigation			0
' @entity0 's chief ethics investigator @entity27 announces he will appeal against the findings , saying the report contains ' numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions ' in his original report			0
november 14 @entity14 admits his ' surprise ' at @entity27 's plans to appeal and adds : ' i will talk to @entity27 but until then i will make no more statements			0
' @entity150 chief executive @entity149 claims it is ' grossly unfair ' for @entity44 to have borne the brunt of criticism and adds : ' the @entity27 report should be out there in full			0
' @entity54 @entity0 member @entity155 and @entity0 vice-president @entity156 from the @entity157 issue a joint statement also calling for @entity27 's report to be published in full			0
@entity0 confirms receipt of @entity27 's intention to appeal			0
november 16 former sports minister sir @entity162 claims @entity0 ran a ' @entity164 ' bidding process for the two tournaments which encouraged would - be hosts to enter into inappropriate behaviour			0
november 17 @entity128 chairman @entity168 writes to @entity0 executive committee members calling for ' urgent action ' to ensure @entity27 's report is published in full , claiming public confidence in @entity0 has hit a new low and that there is ' compelling evidence ' of wrongdoing			0
@entity175 and @entity176 , members of the @entity30 and @entity178 2022 bid teams respectively and key whistleblowers in the original corruption allegations , register separate complaints against @entity14 claiming his report breached promises of confidentiality			2
@entity175 's statement labels @entity14 's report ' a crude , cynical and fundamentally erroneous description of me and the information and materials i provided the investigation '			0
former @entity128 chairman @entity193 urges @entity195 nations to boycott the 2018 @entity4 unless @entity0 undergoes serious reform - including @entity15 not standing for re-election as president			2
november 18 @entity0 lodges a criminal complaint with the @entity9 attorney general over ' possible misconduct ' by individuals in connection with the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 @entity79			1
the move follows a recommendation by @entity0 's ethics judge @entity14 as part of his findings into the @entity27 investigation on @entity4 bidding			1
@entity0 president @entity15 has insisted however that the lodging of the criminal complaint does not affect @entity14 's statement last week that the investigation into the bidding process for the two @entity79 is concluded			1

@entity0 has lodged a criminal complaint with the @entity9 attorney general
complaint regards ' possible misconduct of persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 @entity79 '
@entity15 filed complaint on behalf of ethics judge @entity14
@entity15 said : ' if we had anything to hide , we would hardly be taking this matter to the @entity19 ( of @entity9 '
@entity14 claims ' there is insufficient *incriminating* evidence ' to question @entity78 and @entity30 as @entity4 hosts , however
