a ' miracle ' transplant patient died after junior doctors failed to spot she was suffering organ rejection , her family have claimed			1
@entity4 , 24 , received media attention in 2001 after a six month wait for a new heart - at the time , the longest wait any @entity9 child in need of an organ had been forced to endure			1
her story inspired thousands of people to become potential organ donors but ms @entity4 died on february 1 last year , after she was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis that was hiding another problem with her heart			1
@entity4 , pictured during her engagement photoshoot , died in february last year , just a month before her wedding			1
doctors diagnosed her with diabetic ketoacidosis , but this was hiding another problem with her heart an inquest heard that a trainee registrar at @entity27 failed to read a letter from ms @entity4 's gp detailing her complex medical history and therefore did not to treat her as a priority patient			1
@entity4 , who was five months away from marrying her boyfriend @entity33 , could have been sent to a @entity34 , but instead , the inquest in @entity27 heard she was left for hours between blood tests			1
in a statement read out at the inquest , @entity4 ’s mother , @entity37 said : ' @entity4 was seen by a junior doctor in the morning and transferred at 12.30pm to a diabetes ward			1
' she was not seen by anyone senior on that ward until 4pm			0
by that time her condition had deteriorated			2
i was concerned that the care she was given was not sufficient			0
her mother explains that she called for a doctor at 6pm when her daughter ' screamed out for oxygen ' before collapsing			0
ms @entity4 received media attention in 2001 ( pictured then , aged 12 ) after a six month wait before she received a new heart			1
at the time it was the longest wait any child in @entity9 with a heart defect had experienced @entity37 said : ' if @entity27 had acted earlier on in the day , maybe @entity4 would have survived			1
we feel she could have survived that day			0
' ms @entity4 , who was given just six months to live when she was 13 after being born with two holes in her heart , was given a new lease of life thanks to her heart transplant , which allowed her to go to school , pass her driving test , get a job and meet her fiance			1
she developed type 1 diabetes in 2008 , believed to be as a result of drugs she took to minimise the risk of organ rejection			1
ms @entity4 , of @entity72 , @entity73 , had visited her gp on the morning she died complaining of severe nausea , which she had been suffering from for several days			2
her gp called for an ambulance and @entity4 was taken to the @entity78 department with suspected gastroenteritis			2
ms @entity4 , pictured with fiance @entity33 , developed type 1 diabetes in 2008 , believed to be as a result of the anti-rejection drugs she took			1
she visited her gp on the morning she died , complaining of severe nausea trainee registrar dr @entity84 was given details of ms @entity4 ’s medical history but told the hearing she failed to read the notes			1
hospital staff believed ms @entity4 was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis , caused by a lack of insulin and she was transferred to ward 10 , while staff investigated possible causes			1
when asked by coroner professor @entity95 if dr @entity84 would have acted on ms @entity4 as a matter of urgency , if she had read the letter , she replied ' maybe , yes			2
' dr @entity84 continued : ' i did n’t get a chance to look at the information , as i was also dealing with another patient who was also suffering from a cardiac arrest			0
i was unaware that @entity4 had been moved from the @entity78 department to @entity106			2
ms @entity4 , pictured at her 21st birthday with boyfriend mr @entity108 , called for an ambulance and was taken to @entity78 with suspected gastroenteritis			2
trainee registrar dr @entity84 was given details of ms @entity112 s medical history but told a hearing she failed to read the notes ' @entity4 did not complain about any heart problems to me			1
she was initially responding to treatment and heading in the right direction			0
' dr @entity119 , a consultant physician at @entity27 , raised her concerns over her staff ’s actions			0
' the first decision we made was the wrong one			0
when staff diagnosed the diabetic ketoacidosis , it was , at best , only part of the issue , ' dr @entity119 said			1
' if @entity4 ’s admittance to hospital was purely down to the ketoacidosis , then @entity131 would have been correct			2
' however , my concern is that we set off down a different pathway before we could identify any other issues			0
had we identified these , such as the cardiac rejection , we would have taken a different path , and that maybe would have been the @entity34			0
' staff at @entity143 ( pictured ) believed ms @entity4 was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis , caused by a lack of insulin			1
from the examinations conducted in @entity78 , and by the registrar , doctors found no evidence of heart failure dr @entity119 said a clinician with her own level of expertise and experience may have identified both causes of miss @entity4 ’s illness			1
but when asked by the coroner if a consultant cardiologist should have been alerted straight away , dr @entity119 replied : ' @entity160 is a wonderful thing			0
it ’s clear from the examinations conducted in @entity78 and by the registrar that they found no evidence of heart failure			1
on that basis , i would not have jumped to the consultant cardiologist '			0
diabetic ketoacidosis ( @entity172 ) is a dangerous complication of diabetes caused by a lack of insulin in the body			1
it occurs when the body is unable to use blood sugar ( glucose ) because there is n't enough insulin			0
instead , it breaks down fat as an alternative source of fuel			0
this causes a build - up of a by - product called ketones			0
symptoms include passing large amounts of urine , feeling very thirsty , vomiting and abdominal pain			0
if the condition is diagnosed very early , it may be possible to relieve the symptoms with an insulin injection			0
those with advanced diabetic ketoacidosis must be admitted to hospital where they will be given a combination of insulin and fluids			1
high levels of ketones in the blood disrupt normal working of many parts of the body			0
the more ketones in the blood , the more ill a person with diabetic ketoacidosis will become			1
left untreated , diabetic ketoacidosis can cause potentially fatal complications , such as severe dehydration , coma and swelling of the brain			1
source : @entity223 dr @entity119 made clear the treatment would have been similar had miss @entity4 been transferred to the @entity34			2
she said the cause of death should be recorded as metabolic acidosis , which occurs when the body produces too much acid or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid , along with heart rejection			1
despite a written apology from @entity236 , chief executive of @entity27 and @entity237 , for ' unacceptable mistakes and errors ' , the coroner concluded there were no ' missed opportunities '			0
recording a verdict of natural causes , he gave the cause of death as metabolic acidosis and cardiac rejection			2
' admittance to the @entity34 and a discussion with a cardiologist may have made a difference to the outcome , but we are unable to say for definite , ' professor @entity95 said			0
' thus i am persuaded that there have been no missed opportunities which may have changed the outcome			0
' i am satisfied that the trust initiated the appropriate measures and that there is no ongoing failure in the system			0
@entity4 was a much loved woman who wanted to live a normal life and had succeeded in that			2
' @entity37 , who lives with husband , @entity4 ’s father @entity265 , said after the case : ' in view of @entity236 ’s previous statements to say that he was sorry for the unacceptable mistakes that they made , i do feel we have some closure and we need to move on in our lives and start to try and rebuild it			2
' i do n’t feel that she was given the best quality care			0
' i was very proud of @entity4			2
she was absolutely fantastic and she fought for what she believed in			0
' it is n’t a cure , but she believed that everyone deserved a chance and she just wanted to live her life every day to the full			0

@entity4 received attention in 2001 after a six month wait for a heart
at the time , was longest wait any @entity9 child had been forced to endure
she eventually developed diabetes in 2008 *due* to medication she was taking
last year developed diabetic ketoacidosis which caused doctors to overlook fact her body was beginning to reject her heart
inquest heard doctors failed to read her medical notes but it even if they had , medics would not have *detected* heart failure
cause of death recorded as acidosis and heart failure
