the @entity9 say a surge in support for @entity3 ’s @entity16 party will merely help the @entity18 @entity17			1
the warning came as a new poll showed one in five over- 50s could vote @entity4 at the next general election			1
the counter the threat , @entity24 hope to quell the turmoil in their own ranks by stressing a ‘ @entity28 , get @entity17 ’ message to counter the growing support for @entity4 , who are likely to win more votes than the @entity33			1

senior @entity9 figures expressed dismay yesterday at the veteran cabinet minister ’s unscripted remarks			2
they warned that attacking @entity4 in such intemperate terms and insulting voters tempted to back them is likely to prove counterproductive			1
@entity9 strategists claim to be encouraged that voters fed up with the government are not turning to @entity12 and are instead expressing a protest vote through a right - wing alternative			2
they believe many can be persuaded to return to the fold at the @entity54 , when the choice will be between a government led by @entity57 committed to an @entity59 referendum , lower welfare spending and reform of human rights laws or one led by @entity17 proposing none of those			1

' the @entity9 topped the national poll of over- 50s by @entity102 with 25 per cent , with @entity4 second on 18 per cent			1
its support is also lower among richer voters , unlike the @entity9 , the survey revealed			2
@entity4 was most popular in the @entity107 and @entity108 , with 21 % and 20 % of those questioned saying they would give it their vote			1
the prime minister signalled a new strategy for dealing with @entity4 yesterday when he insisted thursday ’s local elections are chiefly a choice between the ‘ blue team and the red team ’			1

he said : ‘ it ’s a simple and straight choice , at your county council and at the next election , between the blue team who want to keep getting the deficit down , who want to keep reforming immigration and welfare to make it fair , or you have the red team who put the deficit up and who do n’t care if our immigration and welfare system works at all			2
’ @entity139 mayor @entity138 agreed that @entity24 should not ‘ slag them [ @entity4 ] off just for appearing to think , in large part , what many conservatives think ’			1
‘ [ @entity3 ] is a blooming conservative , for heaven ’s sake ; and yet he ’s in our constituencies , wooing our audiences , nicking our votes , and threatening to put our councillors out of office , ’ he said			1
@entity9 mp @entity152 said : ‘ yes , @entity4 have a problem with some of their candidates but @entity36 is plain wrong to use the word “ clowns ”			1
’ mr @entity3 insisted yesterday : ‘ there is nothing in @entity4 that is in any way racist at all			1
