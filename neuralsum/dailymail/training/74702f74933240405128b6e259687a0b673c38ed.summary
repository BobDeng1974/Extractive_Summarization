most people know that no two snowflakes are exactly alike			0
but to see how they become unique hexagonal wonders requires a microscope			0
now one man has created a beautiful video showing how the flakes grow to form their hexagonal shapes in incredible detail			2
more water molecules land on the crystal and create the hexagonal shape as they extend six ways to form arms			0
the reason the flakes have six lines of symmetry is because of the hydrogen bonds in water crystals			0
the precise nature of the shape created depends upon the temperature and the humidity			0
snowflakes with long needles - like arms form in warmer temperatures , while very circular ones are created in colder climates			1
@entity40 video maker @entity38 filmed the formation of the hexagonal ice crystals to produce a two minute ‘ microscopic time - lapse '			1
the flakes are created when a water droplet freezes around pollen or a speck of dust in the air , creating an ice crystal			1
then more water molecules land on the crystal , creating the hexagonal shape as they extend six ways along the ‘ arms ’			2
these ice crystals that make up snowflakes are symmetrical because they reflect the internal order of the crystal ’s water molecules as they arrange themselves in predetermined spaces to form a six - sided snowflake , the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) explained			1
one man has created a beautiful video showing how the flakes grow to form hexagonal shapes in incredible detail ( pictured ) the reason the flakes have six lines of symmetry is because of the hydrogen bonds in water crystals			1
as the water freezes , bound - together water molecules crystallise into a hexagonal structure so that each point on a hexagon is an oxygen atom with hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom on each side , @entity73 reported			0
as the freezing process continues , more water molecules are added to the microscopic structure , causing it to bloom outwards along its six sides and transforms into what we recognise as a snowflake			0

@entity108 , needle - like crystals form at slightly warmer temperatures like - 5 degrees @entity111 , whereas flakes that form in cooler temperatures such as -15 degrees @entity111 are flatter and more circular in shape			2
in this way , the shape of just one arm of a snowflake is determined by the atmospheric conditions experience by the ice crystals as they fall to @entity123			0
just one arm of a snowflake is determined by the atmospheric conditions experience by the ice crystals as they fall to @entity123 its arm might grow in one way and then seconds later , slight changes in the temperature or humidity could make it form in another way and alter the shape dramatically			1
it is this sensitivity to the atmosphere – and the fact that no two flakes can follow exactly the same path through the sky - that means that no two snowflakes are the exactly the same			0

*differently* shaped snowflakes are created depending upon the temperature and the humidity - rounder flakes form in colder temperatures
