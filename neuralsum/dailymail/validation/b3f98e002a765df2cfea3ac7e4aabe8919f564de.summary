bait : the experienced handler was taught a painful lesson during a stunt for visitors at @entity31 ' i was in disbelief when it bit me and i was a little mad and disappointed in myself that i had allowed it to happen			0
' but i 've seen plenty of other people getting bit so i did n't panic at all			0
' he added employees tried to help him by wedging the creature 's mouth open with stick - but it only led to the gator clamping down harder			1
' i knew i had to control the head and keep the gator from rolling or shaking its head and causing me further injury , ' he said			0
' the bite started to hurt a little more as we tried to put sticks in its mouth to wedge it open - every time something touched the inside of its mouth it would clamp down harder			1
' once we were able to pry its mouth open and my hand was free it felt numb - i had one puncture wound that was about half an inch deep and was filled up with blood			1

' at no point was i ever in shock			0
the worst part was when we used a cotton bud with bleach water to clean out the wound and prevent infection			0
' i have no ill will towards the gator at all			0
i honestly have no idea why it closed its mouth and i plan on continuing to catch gators and teach my wrestling class - i just wo n't be doing that trick anymore			2
