the talk among @entity2 fans leaving @entity3 last saturday was about predictable topics : a soporific second half and some erratic kicking			1
but a new development at @entity8 was also under discussion : the giant television screens showing replays			1
for some they represent the inevitable and welcome march of technology			0
for others they have the potential to have a malign influence the game			1
the giant television screens at @entity3 had a significant effect on @entity2 's game against @entity23 former @entity2 coach and @entity26 columnist sir @entity24 is among those who feel there should be strict protocols in place if @entity2 are to avoid criticism of abusing their home advantage at the @entity33			1
against @entity23 the constant use of big - screen replays — and the inevitable partisan reaction of @entity2 fans — appeared to play a part in referee @entity39 ’s decision to yellow card @entity23 hooker @entity40			1
it might also have contributed to @entity39 ’s late decision to review @entity23 ’s third try just before the conversion was being attempted			1
all @entity23 hooker @entity40 ( right ) was sin - binned after tv replays picked up his foul play in a ruck coach @entity50 was not impressed : ‘ my biggest concern is not the @entity52 ( television match official ) or the refs			1
my biggest concern is that tv directors are starting to have an influence on the game			1
’ @entity24 shares @entity50 ’s concerns , saying : ‘ @entity2 have got to be really careful about home advantage and with my @entity62 hat on i feel qualified to talk on this			1
‘ while you want to encourage massive home support there is a solid red line which you must never cross			0
@entity39 stops @entity68 from taking a conversion as he consults the @entity52 to check on the try ‘ you must never ever do anything which could be perceived in any way as influencing the result			2
‘ the @entity74 of the @entity62 worked hard in 2012 to ensure fairness because it could have totally undermined the @entity62			0
‘ there would have been uproar in the athletes ’ village and the media would have had a field day on reports of any perceived @entity84 bias			0
the first thing that needs to be nailed down with the big screens is who makes the decision to show what and when			2
and then a protocol must be put in place			0
@entity39 awards a late penalty try to @entity2 after the home pack got a great shove on the @entity23 forwards ' you must show tries from both sides the same number of times			1
you show alleged incidents of foul play the same number of times			0
you ca n’t have these “ come on @entity2 ” signs flashed up			2
i sense @entity108 was annoyed on saturday and so would i be if i was the visiting team			0
‘ are referees influenced by crowd noise ? yes , definitely			0
before an international i used to study refs much more than any opposition player because they have a much bigger influence on the game			2
‘ assistant refs reporting to them are influenced by crowd noise			0
and then you magnify that by the crowd reacting to the big screen			2
‘ @entity119 has no say in what pictures go on the big screen , but if they choose to dwell on a try decision or an incident that is their editorial decision			2
’ @entity39 ( centre ) plays an advantage to @entity2 during the first half of last saturday 's clash at @entity3 former @entity2 wing @entity132 is strongly in favour of the screens			1
‘ @entity136 screens are here to stay , ’ he says			0
‘ we had a couple of games at the start of the season at @entity142 without a big screen and it was an absolute killer in terms of the atmosphere			1
‘ everybody is standing around wondering what ’s happening			0
if you are asking people to pay good money to support the game you ca n’t exclude them from all the key moments and drama which everybody else back home or in the bar is enjoying			1
when a big screen is available i would do something a bit radical and cut out the conversation between the referee and the @entity52			1
‘ i hate all this , “ try or no try ? ” or “ is there any reason i can not award a try ? ” stuff			0
the only question that matters is “ what happened ? ” ‘ the @entity52 should go through all the camera angles and then put the “ money shot ” up on the screen for the referee to decide			2
it puts pressure on the ref but everybody is under pressure on match day			0
’ @entity179 , season 5 - episode 2			0

the use of big - screen replays played a key role in several of referee @entity39 ’s decisions during @entity2 's *21* - 24 loss to @entity23
@entity23 @entity50 complained after the game that ' tv directors are starting to have an influence on the game '
@entity26 columnist sir @entity24 is among those who feel there should be strict protocols in place if @entity2 are to avoid criticism of abusing their home advantage at the @entity33
former @entity2 wing @entity132 , however , is strongly in favour of the screens at rugby games going forward
