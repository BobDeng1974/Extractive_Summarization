by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 06:02 est , 14 january 2014 a lawyer defending a woman who was caught drink - driving while her small child was at home alone has accused @entity7 's parents of child neglect			1
in what has been described as an ' outrageous ' slur on the missing girl 's parents , defence lawyer @entity9 compared them unfavourably to his client , who left her five - year - old son at home by himself before being arrested after she crashed her car at traffic lights			1
he told magistrates at @entity20 , south @entity21 : ' the parents of @entity7 were guilty of child neglect for leaving their little girl much longer than my client			1
' @entity26 and @entity27 , pictured , were accused of child neglect by a lawyer defending a drink - driving mother the lawyer said that his client , whose son has @entity32 's , was ashamed of what she had done			1
the 44 - year - old defendant , who can not be named , hit the back of another car at traffic lights			2
when police followed her home , she told them they could n't arrest her because her son was by himself in the house , and they found the child asleep under a blanket on the sofa			2
the court heard that the woman was more than two - and - a - half times over the limit when she drove to a cashpoint machine just before midnight			2
on her way home , she ran into a car driven by @entity51 , 21 , which was stopped at traffic lights			0
miss @entity51 suffered head injuries in the crash but magistrates heard that the driver shouted at her , saying it was her fault			0
the woman admitted child neglect , drink - driving and leaving an accident and was given a 12 - month supervision order , 120 hours of unpaid work , a 22 - month driving ban and told to attend a course			1
today a friend of the @entity68 , whose daughter went missing in @entity70 in may 2007 while they ate in a nearby restaurant with friends , hit out at mr @entity9 's comments			1
resort : @entity7 went missing from her apartment in @entity77 in @entity78 in 2007 @entity80 police are hoping to go to @entity70 to interview three new ' prime suspects ' in the hunt for @entity83 , pictured the friend told the mirror : ' if @entity26 and @entity27 were guilty of child neglect , and they were absolutely not , they would have been dealt with			1
' as it is , there are two police inquiries in two different countries trying to find out what happened to @entity83 , and comments made by a lawyer in an unrelated case is offensive , outrageous and inaccurate			0
' it was revealed today that @entity70 police are under mounting pressure to give @entity80 detectives access to the three ' prime suspects ' wanted for questioning over the abduction of @entity7			0
the @entity102 has sent them a second ' @entity104 ' after identifying three burglars who were operating in the @entity107 resort where the @entity68 were staying			0
analysis of mobile phone records at the time show that they made a high number of calls at around the time the small girl was taken			0
it is now known that between january and may 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area around the @entity78 resort where the family from @entity123 , @entity124 , was staying			0
police said in october that in the 17 days before she disappeared there was one burglary and one attempted burglary in the block where the @entity27 family were staying .			0
