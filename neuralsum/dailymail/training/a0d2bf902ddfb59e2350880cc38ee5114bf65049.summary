by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 06:45 est , 20 october 2012 high in the sky over @entity2 in @entity3 , a host of daredevils threw caution to the wind ... by throwing themselves off a 4,600ft - high ledge			1
this was the scene at the first @entity12 in @entity13 on thursday			1
one by one , the eight finalists leapt from the cliff and negotiated a 1.2km - long obstacle course which involved whizzing across a valley , diving beneath a cable car , and other extreme acrobatics , before engaging their parachutes and landing on a red - carpeted mountain road			1
the rules were simple : the fastest flyer wins			1
mr @entity38 has made more than 11,000 skydives and 1,600 wingsuit flights			1
second place went to @entity48 ace @entity46 , who finished the run in 23.55 seconds			2
and @entity51 , from @entity52 , came in third , with 23.84 seconds			2
it was a remarkable achievement for mr @entity51 , a professional sky diver - as in april 2009 , he fell 6,000ft crashing into snow at 100mph after his parachute failed to open during a wingsuit flight over @entity58 , @entity59			2
he broke his back , cracked a rib , chipped several teeth and bruised a lung but amazingly , he lived to tell the tale			2
forced to wear a body brace for three months , he never thought he would be able to jump again			0
each wingsuit consists of fabric stretched between a skydiver 's arms and legs - adding surface area to the human body the contest was originally scheduled to start on october 12 but bad weather made flying conditions too dangerous			0
above , a flyer prepares for take - off each wingsuit consists of fabric stretched between a skydiver 's arms and legs - adding surface area to the human body			0
this allows them to travel horizontally , as well as slow their descent towards the ground			0
there are just 20 people in the world who are qualified to take part in such a competition			0
the contest was originally scheduled to start on october 12 but bad weather made flying conditions too dangerous			0
@entity2 is in @entity94 , and the word @entity96 translates as ' gate in the sky ' - a reference to the huge natural hole in the mountain			1
@entity39 @entity38 ( above ) took first place - setting the benchmark for the wingsuit flying record with a time of 23.41 seconds			0
