by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:57 est , 18 february 2014 inflation yesterday fell to its lowest level for more than four years , in a further sign that the punishing squeeze on family finances is easing			1
figures from the @entity9 showed that the @entity10 dipped from 2 per cent in december to 1.9 per cent last month			1
it was the first time since november 2009 that inflation has been below the @entity13 ’s 2 per cent target , and fuelled hopes that the cost of living crisis is coming to an end as the economy picks up			1
the @entity10 rate of inflation has fallen to 1.9 per cent , but is still around twice average pay rises the drop in inflation will give the bank more breathing space to leave interest rates at the all - time low of 0.5 per cent			1
it traditionally raises rates to combat high inflation			0
city analysts hailed @entity32 as the ‘ @entity34 ’ economy as the combination of low inflation and strong growth suggested it was ‘ not too hot and not too cold ’			0
bank governor @entity38 last week labelled the @entity32 ‘ one of the strongest economies in the advanced world ’ as he raised growth forecasts for this year from 2.8 to 3.4 per cent			0
he also insisted that rates ‘ may need to stay at low levels for some time to come ’			0
@entity44 , chief economist at the @entity45 , said : ‘ the fall in inflation is very good news for businesses and consumers			0
an early rise in interest rates is neither necessary nor likely			2
’ @entity53 tweeted in response to the inflation figures but in a sign that millions of households continue to feel the strain , prices are still rising faster than wages , with workers getting an average pay rise of just 0.9 per cent			1
another measure of inflation – the @entity65 , which takes mortgage costs and rising house prices into account – ticked up from 2.7 per cent in december to 2.8 per cent last month			0
it is hoped , however , that wages will finally overtake prices in the coming months following the longest squeeze on household incomes for at least 50 years			2
@entity73 , @entity32 economist at @entity74 , said : ‘ there is a good chance that @entity10 inflation will fall to as low as 1 per cent by the end of this year and remain subdued thereafter			1
this should enable real earnings to rise for the first year since 2007 and allow the bank to keep interest rates on hold until well into next year			2
’ prime minister @entity53 said the fall in the headline measure of @entity10 inflation – from as high as 5.2 per cent in september 2011 – was ‘ more evidence our long - term economic plan is working ’			1
the dip in inflation last month was driven by falling dvd prices and lower entrance fees to attractions such as museums , as well as discounts on household goods and furniture			0
the traditional @entity99 rise in whisky prices was also less than expected			0
discounts on furniture and lower than expected rises in the cost of whiskey were the main drivers in the inflation fall the @entity10 measures inflation using a representative ‘ shopping basket ’ of goods			1
this includes items ranging from everyday essentials such as bread to other expenditures like air fares			0
but critics claim @entity10 is not a true reflection of the cost of living as it does not include housing expenses such as rent and mortgage interest payments			1
these are part of the alternative @entity65 ( @entity65 ) – which has risen from 2.8 to 2.9 per cent , partly because of the effect of soaring house prices in the @entity130			0
in 2003 , the then chancellor @entity131 adopted the @entity10 measure as it was more comparable internationally and considered to give a better picture of underlying spending patterns without the distortion of house prices			2
the lower figure of @entity10 is also convenient for the government as it is used to dictate increases in pensions , benefits and public sector wages .			2

@entity10 falls to 1.9 ***%*** , lowest level since november 2009
drop below @entity13 target of 2 ***%*** likely to delay interest rate rise
@entity53 says fall is proof his economic plan is working
but with wages rising by less than 1 ***%*** , families are still feeling the squeeze
