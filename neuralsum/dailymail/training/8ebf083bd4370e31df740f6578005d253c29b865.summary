on 18 april 2014 a @entity1 spacecraft was sent crashing into the far side of the moon			1
this was on purpose as the mission came to a close , but scientists had struggled to actually find out where it hit the surface			0
now , in new images , the impact site has been revealed in the form of a new crater on the moon			1
scroll down for interactive module the images reveal a crater caused by the impact of @entity20 ( shown )			1
around the crater ejected material can be seen thrown out on the surface			1
@entity20 crashed into the moon on 18 april 2014 after six months in orbit			1
the images were captured by the @entity28 spacecraft that is still in orbit the crater is believed to have been created by the impact of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) spacecraft on 18 april 2014			1
launch : sept. 6 , 2013 launch site : @entity35 , @entity36 launch vehicle : @entity38 planned mission duration : 100 days actual mission duration : 128 days mass : 844 lbs ( 383 kg ) power : 295 watts cost : £ 167 million ( $ 280 million ) mission legacy : @entity20 identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere			2
it also studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon , created by all the surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites			0
scientists hope to use the data to address a long - standing question : was lunar dust , electrically charged by sunlight , responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several @entity59 missions ? @entity20 also hosted @entity1 ’s first dedicated system for two - way communication using laser instead of radio waves			2
it was spotted by @entity1 ’s @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , which has orbited the moon since 2009			2
the crater was hard to spot because the impact energy of @entity20 was not particularly high compared to , say , a large meteorite			2
to perform the impact the spacecraft had been slowly lowered in its orbit and , and the time of crashing , was travelling about 3,800 mph ( 6,000 km / h )			0
while that might seem fast , in cosmic terms it is relatively slow compared to meteorite impacts			0
this meant the actual crater the impact created was small			0
in order to find the crater , scientists used images taken before and after the impact			0
by dividing the before image by the after image they were able to spot changes to the surface			0
in this instance the ejected material from the impact forms a triangular pattern that extends up to about 1,000 feet ( 300 metres ) from the impact site			1
@entity20 ’s engines fired on 11 april 2014 , to perform a final orbital maintenance maneuver and adjust to guarantee it would impact on the farside of the moon and away from the @entity59 landing sites			1
drag vertical line on module below for before and after the @entity20 crash over a seven - day period , @entity20 ’s orbit decreased and the spacecraft orbited very low to the surface and close to the walls of lunar craters and mountain ridges to give the team a chance to collect valuable science data			1
finally , @entity20 impacted the eastern rim of @entity114 crater on april 18			2
@entity20 ( illustration shown ) identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere			0
it also studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon , created by all thesurface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites the impact site is about half a mile ( 780 meters ) from the crater rim with an altitude of about 8,500ft ( 2,590 meters )			2
it was only about two tenths of a mile ( 300 meters ) north of the location mission controllers predicted based on tracking data			0
' as it turns there were several small surface changes found in the predicted area of the impact , the biggest and most distinctive was within 968 feet ( 295 meters ) of the spot estimated by the @entity20 operations team , ' said @entity136 , @entity28 ( @entity28 ) principal investigator from @entity138 in @entity139			1
' i 'm happy that the @entity28 team was able to confirm the @entity20 impact point , ' added @entity143 , @entity20 project manager at @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity146			1
' it really helps the @entity20 team to get closure and know exactly where the product of their hard work wound up			0
' this artist concept shows the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) with @entity59 mission imagery of the moon in the background			0
the @entity28 has been in orbit around the moon since 2009			0

scientists at @entity1 in @entity146 have found the impact site of a lunar probe
the @entity20 spacecraft was purposefully crashed into the moon this year
but until now its crash site on the far side of the moon had *n't* been found
now new images reveal a crater caused by the impact of @entity20
around the crater ejected material can be seen thrown out on the surface
@entity20 crashed into the moon on 18 april 2014 after six months in orbit
the images were captured by the @entity28 spacecraft that is still in orbit
