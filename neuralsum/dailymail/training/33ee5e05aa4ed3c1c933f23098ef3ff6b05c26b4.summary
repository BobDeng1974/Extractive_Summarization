@entity0 has warned @entity2 ’s @entity1 that , as a newcomer to the @entity5 goldfish bowl , he has no idea how hard it will be to win a high - pressure @entity8 semi final			1
speaking before saturday ’s @entity12 draw teed up the first @entity13 and @entity2 clash in almost three years , the confident @entity11 striker had claimed the @entity17 side ’s last - four opponents were ‘ going down ’			1
describing the last - four draw as a shot in the arm for the @entity22 game , however , @entity0 cautioned his @entity2 counterpart that an @entity8 cup tie is unlike anything he will ever have experienced in football before			1
@entity2 striker @entity1 will play in his first @entity8 clash with @entity13 in the @entity12 sem - final @entity13 ' @entity0 ( right ) , pictured playing against @entity29 , says @entity1 will not know what to expect ‘ good for @entity1 , ’ said the @entity32 striker after news of the city rivals ’ first meeting since april 2012 filtered through , ‘ but that ’s someone speaking who has never played in an @entity8 game before and who does n’t know what he ’s in for			1
‘ i do n’t think it makes sense for anyone to stand up and say they ’re going to steamroller teams , or do this or that , or such - and - such is going down			0
‘ until you ’ve played in that @entity8 fixture you do n’t know what it takes and anyone can win those games on the day			1
’ @entity0 reckons that a @entity13 old guard featuring himself @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 could give his side the edge in the semi-final			1
@entity0 ( right ) has played in @entity8 matches before , including scoring in may 2007 , and says they are unique perhaps there was a failure on his part to acknowledge the fact that @entity2 also have a group of @entity8 veterans featuring the likes of skipper @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
but @entity0 , clearly of the belief that the @entity32 side have performers who have been more steeped in the fixture over time , insisted : ‘ we ’ve got five or six players who have played in @entity8 games before			1
i ’m not so sure about @entity2			2
it can be an advantage because you know exactly what you ’re going into			0
‘ @entity2 will be confident but if anyone was jumping around their dressing room at news of the draw then i ’d bet it was none of those who have played in it - it will be those who do n’t really know what it takes			2
we ’ll see what happens when it comes around			0
’ @entity99 's @entity13 , in action against @entity98 , are currently playing in the @entity100 a level of campaign weariness is likely before the tie finally comes around in three months ’ time - with the @entity105 showdown taking place on either january 31 or february 1 - but @entity0 believes the resumption of old hostilities after so long on the backburner is good news for a @entity22 game which has been divided and scarred following the @entity32 club ’s financial demise in 2012			1
‘ it ’s great , ’ said the 31 - year - old striker			0
‘ the whole of @entity22 football needs this fixture			0
it ’s a great opportunity for the two biggest clubs in the country to go head to head again			0
‘ we know that we ’re still a division below @entity2 , but we look forward to the game			2
it ’s something for people to look forward to			0
‘ there ’s not been a lot to talk about in @entity22 football in the last couple of years in terms of @entity13 and @entity2			1
‘ there has been a lot of negativity because they have n’t been playing each other - and it gives us an opportunity to build up what should hopefully be a tremendous game			0
‘ it ’s a chance for us to show that @entity22 football is n’t dead			0
@entity2 players celebrate during their 3 - 0 win over rivals @entity13 back in april 2012 in the @entity142 ‘ we ’re still massive clubs worldwide and we want to go and put on a performance - but we know that we need to be at our best if we ’re to have any chance of beating them			1
‘ people will write us off but we ’re confident going into any game with the players we ’ve got here			0
‘ i think everyone in the dressing room will be looking forward to the @entity2 game			2
for us , it ’s a difficult game and @entity2 will go in as favourites			2
‘ but we know that if we play at our best then we can give anyone in @entity22 a game			0
but , for us , the main focus is showing our league form of the last couple of months			0
’ reacting to a school of thought that the pressure is all on @entity164 ’s men - given their continued prominence in the @entity22 game - boyd was dismissive of any such suggestion and insisted that no @entity13 player ever goes into a game without the weight of expectation on his shoulder			2
@entity2 players celebrate their impressive 6 - 0 win over @entity175 in the @entity12 on wednesday speaking after scoring his eighth goal of the season in a 1 - 0 @entity180 win at @entity29 on saturday , the frontman added : ‘ as soon as you pull on that blue jersey you never accept defeat so the pressure is also on us despite being underdogs			1
‘ the responsibility of being a @entity13 player is that you need to win			2
it will be a massive game but i ca n’t emphasise enough how much our focus needs to be getting back into the top flight			0
‘ we want four , five , six @entity8 games a season and that will only happen once @entity13 get back to the top and if you draw each other in the @entity195			1
‘ the most important thing right now is to focus on the league and to get back to the @entity142			0
‘ we ’ve got a massive game coming up against @entity98 at the end of the month and before that we ’ve got @entity201 on tuesday night and @entity202 and @entity203 at home where we ’ll be looking to keep the pressure on @entity98			0
’ @entity207 completed the scoring during @entity2 's 3 - 0 win over @entity13 in the last @entity8 in 2012			1
