' she also wrote and directed 1978 's @entity78 , while @entity79 was included despite only directing one film ( 1998 's @entity81 )			1
@entity1 's omission from the tribute section of the @entity4 immediately stirred up a passionate reaction on @entity85			1
' no @entity1 ? tacky to say the least , ' tweeted @entity87			0
tacky : fans quickly took to @entity85 to protest the ' tacky ' omission of @entity1 colleagues : @entity92 , a tv - host colleague of @entity1 's , tweeted quickly in indignation anger : some @entity85 users grew angry about the snub jokes : in @entity1 's style , some protested with the use of humour missing : from the beginning of the show , some missed @entity1 's signature style on the red carpet talk - show host @entity92 chimed in as well : ' no mention of @entity1 in the @entity109 ? ! that 's not right			1
' ' # @entity4 feels wrong w / out # @entity111			0
bummed the @entity4 did n't include the red carpet queen during the @entity3 , ' wrote @entity113			1
some fans on social media at least found a little dark comedy in the situation			0
' @entity1 is gon na surprise us after the commercial break by being alive , i guess , ' wrote @entity121			0

comedian *rivers* was a surprising omission from sunday night 's tribute to those no longer with us
@entity1 was better known more for her caustic *critiques* of those *walking* the red carpet , but she had also appeared in and even directed a movie
more of a @entity179 track record than others included in the tribute including @entity79
the @entity4 responded admitting @entity1 was ' worthy ' of a mention
other shock omissions from the segment included @entity27 , @entity64 and @entity66
