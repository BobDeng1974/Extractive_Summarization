at around 7.30am yesterday , keepers at @entity24 found that the fence around the wolf enclosure was damaged and five of the six wolves had escaped			1
one of the wolves returned to the enclosure and another was successfully drugged with an anaesthetic dart and recaptured			1
but the zoo said it had to kill the other three wolves as they managed to escape from the zoo ’s grounds , posing a public risk			2
two were shot dead close to the zoo			1
police , helped by a helicopter , searched a nearby wooded area for several hours before the final wolf was found			2

zoo curator @entity62 last night said : ‘ at 7.30am this morning we discovered that the perimeter fence of @entity24 ’s wolf enclosure had actually been damaged and five of our six timber wolves had left the enclosure			1
‘ it is not known at this stage how the damage occurred despite the fence being checked by the keepers on a daily basis			2
‘ one of the wolves did return to the enclosure almost immediately of its own accord , another one was secured within the zoo and was darted and recaptured and put back into the enclosure			2
‘ unfortunately three of the other wolves did make their way out of the zoo , out of the safety of the zoo ’s perimeter grounds			2
‘ an anaesthetic dart can take 15 minutes or more to work			0
in a highly stressed or excited animal it may not work at all			0
zoo staff shot dead two more of escapees , because they had got further away from the zoo which is based on the edge of @entity19 ( file picture ) five timber wolves were discovered to have fled through a damaged fence at @entity24 in @entity20 this morning ‘ so , we did have to make the decision that these animals had to be shot on sight			1
these are wild animals , they are dangerous wild animals , they are not pets and they are in a very unpredictable situation and they would have posed a very real risk to the public			0

@entity111 , 62 , said : ‘ we saw the helicopter go up over the woods and i certainly am worried about my dog			0
i ’m keeping a close eye on him as you just do n’t know what might happen			0
‘ i think people will need to be careful but it seems that a lot of them are not even aware of it			0
’ the @entity124 spent the day searching for a wolf which escaped from @entity24 officers and a police helicopter were searching the fields surrounding @entity24 to find the final escaped wolf during the search @entity131 , of the @entity132 and @entity133 , warned residents to stay indoors			2
he said : ‘ i would suggest that people keep young children inside until the wolf is found			0
if it has been hand fed and it is used to approaching a keeper for food then it is more likely to approach the public			0
‘ people are at most risk if they are out on their own in woodland areas with food or pets			0
as with any wild animals i would advise people to take precautions			0
’ five timber wolves escaped from @entity24 in october 1986 when heavy rain undermined their fence , but on that occasion all were safely recaptured			1
