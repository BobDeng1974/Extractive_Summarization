by @entity0 published : 18:53 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 18:53 est , 7 july 2013 @entity2 minister @entity1 has become the latest senior figure to land a blow against the @entity6 rail link			1
the @entity8 mp , whose @entity10 constituency in @entity11 will be affected by the line , joined the chorus of opposition to @entity6 – though as a minister he is duty bound to back the scheme			2
he raised fears over the spiralling cost – now at £ 42.6billion – and noise of the trains			1
in a letter to transport secretary @entity23 , mr @entity1 came close to calling for the project to be scrapped after its budget soared by £ 10 billion			1
objections : @entity2 minister @entity1 is worried about the spiralling cost of the @entity6 project he wrote that constituents had told him this rise ‘ gives them no confidence that the final figure will [ not ] be significantly higher and in the current economic climate that can not be justified ’			1
voters believed @entity6 should be cancelled and the money spent on other infrastructure projects , he added			0
mr @entity1 also cast doubt on the level of noise those living along the @entity6 line would have to endure			1
in a letter to @entity44 , @entity6 ’s chief executive , he said the study measuring average noise levels had included the period between midnight and 5am , when no trains run			2
this had led to ‘ very serious underestimates of what my constituents are likely to experience between 11pm and midnight and 5am and 7am ’ , he said			0
mr @entity1 has been criticised by some constituents for not backing a rebel attempt to scupper paving legislation for @entity6			2
high speed : mr @entity1 is also worried about late night and early morning noise from the line affecting his @entity11 constituents but he made clear resigning was a ‘ nuclear ’ option			1
environment secretary @entity61 is said to be ‘ not a fan ’ of the project and former welsh secretary @entity64 has labelled the scheme a ‘ boys ’ toy ’			0
the government insists @entity6 will boost the economy in the @entity70 and that scrapping it would cost close to 100,000 jobs			0
the first stage , between @entity73 and @entity74 , will start in 2017 and finish in 2026			0
the second stage , to @entity76 and @entity77 , should be completed by 2033 .			0
