the @entity1 leaders of a troop of @entity3 are defying orders from their national hq to scrap the old promise to ‘ love my @entity7 ’			1
a controversial decision was made in june to abandon allegiance to @entity7 , with the traditional pledge replaced with the words ‘ be true to myself and develop my beliefs ’			1
the new promise comes into effect from september 1			0
but last night it was revealed that a group of ‘ rogue ’ @entity20 leaders have vowed that they will stick with the old promise and defy the line set by @entity22 , the national body			1

a mention of vowing to love or serve @entity7 has been included in the promise since the @entity3 began in 1910			1
