there are times in life when the mirror is seriously not your friend , and the moment i catch sight of my reflection as my eyebrows are being dyed is certainly one of them			1
clouds of black foam are clumping in gigantic globs , @entity16 - style , where i used to have normal arcs of facial hair			2
fortunately , there is no cause for alarm			0
this is merely the first step in the uber - fashionable hd brows treatment i am receiving , in a quest for striking , @entity22 - inspired arches			1
my own brows have always been a somewhat shapeless and nondescript shade of mouse , barely tweaked by tweezer and never touched by make - up , despite the amount of slap i habitually trowel on everywhere else			1
i just did n’t think it would make any difference			2
@entity52 , @entity53 and girl band @entity51 are all on her books			0
@entity56 is the latest of her clients to grab headlines with her dramatically resculpted brows			2
two weeks ago she was spotted on the red carpet without the barely - there blonde arches which usually curved above her eyes			2
in their place she flaunted thick , straight and strikingly darker brows — the result of 18 months of @entity69 appointments , every four to six weeks			1
‘ she began with really slim brows , ’ says 43 - year - old @entity44			1
‘ i convinced her a fuller brow would suit her deep - set eyes and frame her face			2
‘ so i put her on a regrowth serum and would n’t let her tweeze anything herself between appointments			0
she loves the power brow she has now , though it does n’t suit everyone — it usually complements a fuller , wider or long face , and also girls who wear minimal make - up , for example @entity82 and @entity84			1
’ @entity22 's ( pictured in october 2014 ) famous brows have inspired a trend in bushier and darker eyebrows actually , i ’m not the biggest fan of @entity91 ’s new look — it ’s a tad over-stated for my taste			1
however , i am intrigued to see what @entity44 will make of my weedy brows			1
‘ i notice everyone ’s brows , ’ @entity44 admits			1
‘ i talk to their brows			0
@entity98 is top of my customer wish - list			0
@entity103 too — i love her , but her brows look too strong for her face , too done			0
she could do with them lighter and softer			0
’ i have to apply a patch test at home 48 hours before my appointment to ensure there ’s no reaction to the dye , then we begin the first step in the hd process — consultation			2
@entity44 asks if i know what colour and style i ’m looking for ( my answer : nothing too terrifying ) and what my usual maintenance regime is ( barely any )			2
@entity56 ( pictured in december 2014 ) is the latest celebrity to grab the headlines with her new thicker brows thanks to eyebrow stylist , @entity44 ‘ of course there is only so much we can do with just this one appointment , ’ she says			1
‘ i can get you on track but 80 per cent of clients have to follow a regrowth plan lasting for up to 18 months			1
‘ when i dye your brows i will include some of the downy , fluffy hair you have around the edge of your brow , then cheat by using some of it to make the brow look thicker			2
‘ i ’ll show you how to achieve the shape with a bit of make - up			1
we fake it until we make it			0
’ i am told i should not tweeze anywhere at all after the first session , and that in 12 to 18 months the brows will be much thicker			1
however , she adds that about 20 per cent of clients never achieve full regrowth and always have to enhance their brows with make - up			1
i point out what @entity44 has , of course , already noted — that my left brow is far more arched than my right			2
‘ no one ’s brows are naturally symmetrical and if they were it would look strange , ’ smiles @entity44			1
‘ that said , i always prefer the shape of one brow , and on you it ’s your right			0
‘ think of your brow in two parts , the body and the tail			0
the body — the wider part — should form two thirds of the length , with the tail — the thinner part — as the last third			0
at the moment the body of your left brow reaches under halfway			0
‘ also , the bulb of your right brow begins nearer the bridge of your nose , which i like			0
so i ’ll fill that in on the left to match , and also widen the thin arched part			0
’ @entity44 then starts step two , the custom - blended colouring , by cleansing my eyebrow area and decides on a medium ash brown , from around 100 available shades			1
for the four minutes or so while the dye is on , i look like the lovechild of @entity194 and longtime @entity196 leader @entity195 — and when @entity44 wipes off the dye , the resulting brows are startlingly dark			1
step three is browmapping , where @entity44 judges how much of the tinted fluff can be incorporated into the new brow shape			1
step four sees the application of eyebrow wax to the surplus dyed fluff , then step five is the slightly painful threading , which removes the waxed hairs to create a natural look			0
her final step is to add pencil and powder to make the brows bolder and fill in any gaps			2
and after 45 minutes of her hallowed ministrations , i have to admit : i ’m a total convert to the church of the @entity69 , singing non-stop happy - clappy hymns to the utterly transformative effect of her method			0
@entity44 says powder brows usually complement a fuller , wider or long face , or girls who wear minimal make - up , for example @entity82 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) the mirror is my friend again , after all : my unbecomingly small eyes are somehow enlarged by the darker , thicker brows that @entity44 has created			1
suddenly i understand why i have always looked vaguely peculiar without my habitual heavy fringe — because my eyebrows were so unformed that it almost appeared i did n’t have any			0
even without make - up , surely the ultimate test of hideousness , i no longer resemble a boiled egg			1
my previously blancmange - like features have been reframed by new , defining contours			0
@entity39 ( pictured after the treatment ) feels the work done on her eyebrows has reframed her face , giving it ' new , defining contours ' i am an instant junkie			1
i know i do n’t want to give this up			0
fortunately , there are now around 4,000 accredited hd brows stylists nationwide , all of whom have paid £ 1,200 to attend @entity44 ’s three - day course and receive instruction in the technique			1
many hd stylists charge £ 40 per appointment , so maintenance visits every four to six weeks , as recommended , may require the thick end of £ 500 a year			0
before seeing @entity44 , i would have thought that sum an absurd expenditure on eyebrows			2
but now i completely get it			0
more to the point , so does my new best friend , the mirror .			0

@entity39 rarely plucks her eyebrows or uses make - up on them
she had her eyebrows dyed during the hd brows treatment
the process also includes custom - blended colouring and browmapping
80 per cent of @entity44 's clients follow a regrowth plan for up to 18 months
