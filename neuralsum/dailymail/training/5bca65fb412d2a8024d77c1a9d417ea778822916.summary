@entity1 governor @entity0 has taken his firmest step yet toward running for president , launching an organization that allows him to raise money for a potential 2016 campaign			1
while not a formal entry into the race , opening the political action committee is the most definitive sign yet that @entity0 will seek the @entity12 presidential nomination			2
the move comes not long after former @entity15 gov. @entity14 announced in december he was launching a similar organization , which kicked off an aggressive race to lock down donors and may have drawn 2012 @entity12 nominee @entity19 into the race			1
road to the @entity21 : @entity1 governor @entity0 launched a federal political action committee , or @entity23 , monday as he seeks to lay the ground work for a likely 2016 presidential campaign preparting to run ? the new group , leadership matters for @entity23 , will allow the 52 - year - old to travel the country to raise money and support like - minded politicians , but it ca n’t specifically advocate on his behalf ' we believe there 's a void right now in leadership throughout the country , ' @entity0 's chief political adviser @entity33 told @entity39 , which first reported the news early monday			1
' we aim to support candidates who are willing to take on tough problems and make tough decisions			0
' the creation of the political action committee 7/87/8 — called @entity46 — was widely expected			0
the former federal prosecutor has been in the @entity12 's presidential discussion since 2012 , when he passed on the race and was later considered by @entity19 as a potential running mate			0
can he do it ? the launch comes two days after @entity0 appeared at a conservative cattle call in @entity54 , where he sought to prove he could reach out to a skeptical party base after overwhelmingly winning re-election in heavily @entity58 @entity1 in 2013 , @entity0 turned quickly toward laying the groundwork for a 2016 campaign			1
in the past several months , he has held meetings to court donors , convened late - night briefing sessions on foreign policy and made repeated visits to early - voting states , including @entity54 over the weekend			0
he takes his next step into the race with several advantages , among them having recently completed a banner year of fundraising as chair of the @entity73			0
the group raised more than $ 100 million on @entity0 's watch and helped @entity12 candidates win a series of unexpected races , including the nominally @entity58 states of @entity80 and @entity81			1
serving as @entity73 chief also gave @entity0 the opportunity to travel across the country and build relationships with donors and activists			0
he is also one of his party 's most talented retail politicians , reveling in the kind of one - on - one interaction that voters in the crucial early voting states of @entity54 and @entity95 demand			0
thinking it over : @entity0 is not expected to make a final decision on his candidacy until the spring also running ? earlier this month , former @entity15 gov. @entity14 launched a leadership pac and a super pac in preparation for his presidential run but @entity0 also has challenges to overcome , including the still - pending federal investigation into accusations that former staff members and appointees created traffic jams as political payback against the @entity58 mayor of a @entity112 suburb by blocking access lanes to the @entity114 into @entity115			1
he 's also dogged by questions about the economy of @entity1 , including several recent downgrades of the state 's credit rating and sluggish job growth			2
@entity0 is also viewed with distrust in certain conservative circles , while other question whether his brash persona and habit of confrontation will play well outside his home state			0
while @entity0 has told supporters to ' relax ' about the timing of his entry into the race , he has faced mounting pressure to get started after @entity14 — whose support and donor base significantly overlaps with @entity136 — said he would ' actively explore ' a run			2
@entity0 's campaign is likely to focus on many of the themes he 's spent years developing in @entity1 , including a pitch that he can expand the @entity12 's tent by appealing to independent , women and minority voters , who helped him win his commanding re-election victory as governor in the reliably blue state .			1

@entity0 , 52 , has not declared a bid for the presidency , but has discussed national themes in recent *speeches*
he was in @entity54 , a *key* state in the primary elections , this weekend for a *summit* attended by *influential* @entity12 activists
@entity0 , who many conservatives see as a moderate , touted his *ability* to appeal to a broad section of the electorate from *hispanics* to independents
according to a poll released last *thursday* , nearly three in five *registered* voters in @entity1 do not think @entity0 would make a good president
@entity0 's *popularity* was dented over revelations that officials in his administration ordered closures on the @entity114 in 2013
earlier this month , former @entity15 governor @entity14 launched a leadership pac and a super pac in preparation for his presidential run
it 's expected @entity0 will make a decision in the spring
