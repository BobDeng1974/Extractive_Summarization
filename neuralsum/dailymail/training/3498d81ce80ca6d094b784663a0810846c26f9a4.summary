@entity0 , whose real name is @entity3 , famously quit the internet in late 2014 after it emerged that the editorial team at @entity6 helped with the writing of her book			1
the 23 - year - old 's debut novel , girl online , broke the all - time record for highest first - week sales for a debut author , selling 78,109 copies in its first seven days but as rumours started to spread about a possible ghostwriter , @entity6 confirmed that @entity3 did not write girl online on her own			0
and now , her friend and fellow vlogger , @entity21 , is hoping for similar success as she prepares to publish her debut tome - but has already admitted she had help			1
writing on her blog , the 25 - year - old said : ' books have always been a huge part of my life from a very young age			1
' i started brainstorming ideas for a book that i thought my viewers would appreciate and i came up with the idea that is now love , @entity21			1
' @entity21 explains that she wanted to write a book that told a bit of her story - including things she has never shared before - without it ending up being an autobiography			1
it will be full of beauty , fashion , baking , love , friendship , the world of @entity0 and just life in general , she promises			1
' i also wanted to talk about my journey to becoming confident and happy about who i am , in the hope that it might help people reading it feel more confident and happy , ' she said			0
@entity21 wanted to write a book that told a bit of her story without it ending up being an autobiography			1
the book , right , will be full of beauty , fashion , baking , love , friendship , the world of @entity0 , she promises @entity3 's debut novel , girl online , broke the record for highest first - week sales for a debut author , selling 78,109 copies in its first week			1
but @entity6 confirmed that @entity3 did not write girl online on her own but it was n't all plain - sailing for @entity21 , who admits that she had her idea rejected several times			1
' i basically got together my book idea and took it round to lots of different publishers			2
most said no , i guess there was n't a gap in the market for this kind of book at the time , ' she explains			2
' however , after a few months i went back and tried again and a couple of publishers said they would like to publish my book			2
' however , i had my heart set on @entity6 , just because they were the main publishing house i had heard of growing up and i had read so many books by them			0
i just felt it would be so exciting to have my very own book published my them			2
' @entity21 , who often sits front row at fashion week and is a regular on the @entity107 social circuit , is already planning big things for 2015 the beauty blogger 's dreams came true			1
@entity6 got in touch and said that while her idea needed developing , they wanted to publish her musings			0
clearly learning from @entity3 's mistake , @entity21 added : ' @entity6 hired an amazing writer , @entity115 , to help me			1
although i wanted to write the whole book myself , i knew it was n't realistic with the time scale we had to work to			2
' @entity115 came over almost every day for a week and we just talked loads with a dictaphone running , i told her all about the chapters i had planned and she suggested new ones and we basically just brainstormed			0
@entity115 then went home and transcribed our days of chatting and came up with a draft and structure for the book			2
i then spent all my time working on the text			0
' @entity21 's Â£ 12.99 book is n't available for another few weeks but no doubt there are already plenty of pre-orders			1
it 's no secret that the adolescents of today spend much of their time online and their daily influences can be found on the web			0
dubbed @entity141 , there is little that young people ca n't consume online whether that 's music , films or even books - entire lives can be stored on screen			0
and for a breed of youths dubbed vloggers , filming their daily musings and sharing them on @entity0 has snowballed from an innocent hobby to a money - making machine			0
so successful have certain vloggers - including @entity21 - become that they 're taking the world of literature , beauty and television by storm			1
indeed , research this week by @entity162 to celebrate their sponsorship of @entity165 : men , which kicks off on friday , discovered that men ( not just teens ) are increasingly turning to @entity0 lifestyle gurus for inspiration over their favourite celebrities			0
@entity172 favourite @entity21 , who lives in @entity107 , accumulates 10m views per month on her channel , has almost 2m subscribers and nearly a million @entity177 followers			1
so influential is @entity21 that she created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes that amassed the biggest waiting list that @entity182 had ever witnessed when they went on sale			1
speaking to @entity185 about her success , the 24 - year - old said : ' i 'm not entirely sure how my @entity0 channel has become such a success , but i think it could be to do with my positive , friendly personality			0
' i think the girls who watch my videos can relate to me as i 'm not a traditional celebrity that seems unattainable , i 'm still just a normal girl despite my large following			0
' people say that when they watch my videos thy feel like i 'm their friend and i love that			0
when i meet fans in the street i always feel like we could be best friends as we seem to always have lots in common which is lovely ! @entity21 created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes			1
when the products went on sale , they amassed the biggest waiting list that @entity182 had ever witnessed ' i think the world of @entity0 is amazing in that you can feel like you 're hanging out with your girlfriends just by watching a video			0
it 's also incredible in that , if it was n't for my @entity0 channel , i would n't have started my own makeup line			0
' i could n't have done it without the support of my fans			0
i spent a year and a half developing my lip gloss and nail polish range and was involved every step of the way			2
' i started with these products as i feel like lip gloss and nail polish are fun items of beauty as you can wear so many different colours and play around lots			2
' i love the colours i designed so much and i named them after all of my favourite things and places			0
' for example , i got engaged in @entity239 , so i named one of the darker polishes @entity239 night and i love picnics so i named my favourite pretty pink gloss @entity244			0
' @entity21 , who often sits front row at fashion week and is a regular on the @entity107 social circuit , says she is already planning big things for 2015 , which she hopes will have have similar success .			1
