the rise of internet pornography could be contributing to lower marriage rates , a study has found			1
men use online porn for ‘ low cost sexual gratification ’ because they do n’t have to deal with the emotional complexities of a relationship			1
the researchers said it was ‘ disrupting traditional family arrangements ’ and backed @entity12 ’s porn filter - because it may increase marriage rates			1
the rise of internet pornography could be lowering marriage rates , a study has found ( stock image ) in their paper the researchers write : ‘ if one of the important reasons to get married has a low cost alternative , then it is natural to wonder about the extent to which one can replace the other			1
‘ the results in this paper suggest that such an association exists , and that it is potentially quite large			0
’ the team looked at @entity32 data on how 1,500 men aged 18 - 35 years old used the internet between 2000 and 2004 , when internet porn was nowhere near as prevalent as it is now			2
in particular they looked at how much time the men spent on the @entity34 , and how much porn they looked at in the past 30 days			2
the general trend was that higher internet use was linked to lower marriage rates			2
however , more than anything else , the use of porn was associated with men who were not married			2
by contrast , those who regularly used religious websites were more likely to be married			0
the researchers found that the increasing ease in which pornography could be accessed was an ' important factor underlying the decline in marriage formation and stability '			1
in their paper the researchers write : ‘ if one of the important reasons to get married has a low cost alternative , then it is natural to wonder about the extent to which one can replace the other ' under changes brought in by @entity12 prime minister @entity66 , users can now choose to ‘ opt in ’ to internet porn rather than having search results come up automatically			1
the change is a victory for the @entity73 ’s @entity72 campaign			0
pornography depicting rape has also been banned under the plans to get rid of ‘ poisonous ’ content			0
the research was published by the @entity78 for the @entity79 in @entity80 and was led by dr @entity81 of the @entity82 , @entity83			0
it states : ‘ while it is probably impossible to eliminate online access to pornography at this point , policies like those in the @entity12 can at least increase the cost associated with accessing it			1
‘ if the results in this paper are correct , policies along these lines have the potential to reduce pornography usage and increase marital entry , with its attendant welfare improvements ’			1
under changes brought in by @entity12 prime minister @entity66 , internet users can now choose to ‘ opt in ’ to internet porn rather than having search results come up automatically ; researchers said policies like @entity66 's ' can at least increase the cost associated ' with accessing pornography , which could led to a reduction in the amount of x-rated material being viewed statistics released earlier this year showed that married people are now in a minority in @entity114 and @entity115 for the first time			1
figures from the @entity118 show that 51 per cent of people are ' not married ' , up from 47 per cent in a decade			0
it marks a dramatic shift from the 1930s when nine in 20 people had married by the time they turned 40			0
at the same time @entity34 use has rocketed and last year 36 million adults , or 73 per cent of the grown up population , accessed the internet every day			0
that is 20 million more than in 2006 when comparable records began			0
some seven in ten people now own a smartphone with research showing we are so addicted to our devices we get withdrawal symptoms after just a few hours if we do n’t hold them .			0
