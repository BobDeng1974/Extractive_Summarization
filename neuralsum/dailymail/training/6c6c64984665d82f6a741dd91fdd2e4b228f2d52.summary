by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's preparations for the new season continued on thursday as he trained with his @entity6 team - mates for the second time			1
the veteran midfielder has penned a six - month contract with the @entity11 champions ahead of starting his @entity13 career with @entity14 next year			1
and the 36 - year - old looked determined to get himself fully fit for the @entity17 clash with @entity18 this sunday during an intense session at sunny @entity20			0
settling in : @entity3 prepares to receive the ball during @entity6 training at @entity20 new boy : @entity3 takes a touch during a drill with team - mates including @entity27 ( far right ) friendly face : @entity3 chats with @entity30 team - mate @entity29 ( left ) before his second session with @entity6 @entity3 was pictured taking part in a number of drills with the rest of @entity37 's squad after being welcomed by @entity30 team - mate @entity29			1
although he will hope to be involved at @entity38 , @entity3 will miss the final game of his contract - against @entity41 at @entity42 - as he does not want to risk upsetting his former club 's fans			2
he 'll have no such worries this weekend when @entity37 's men aim to start their season with a trophy by beating @entity50 holders @entity18			0
@entity3 enjoyed plenty of success against the @entity53 during his time at @entity42 and he 'll be keen to begin his brief @entity6 career with by winning the season 's first silverware			2
one man who has been left saddened by @entity3 's move to the @entity60 is @entity41 skipper @entity61 , who has admitted that it does't ' feel right ' to see his former team - mate in @entity6 's colours			1
@entity61 told @entity65 : ' i felt lost the first few days ( of pre season )			0
at @entity68 is next door to me and @entity70 ( @entity71 ) is a couple up			0
' we 've grown up together and won and lost here at @entity41 and done many great things so i was very sad to see them go			0
' and to see @entity70 already sign for @entity76 and @entity77 has signed for @entity14 ... it does n't seem right to me seeing them in different shirts			2
maybe over time that will ease but it does n't seem right			0
' all smiles : @entity3 enjoys a joke with new team - mate @entity84 as he gets his running trainers on friends : @entity61 and @entity3 developed a bond during more than a decade together at @entity41			1

he will link up with @entity13 side @entity14 early next year
