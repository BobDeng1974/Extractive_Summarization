a pretty girl wanders off from an anniversary party and heads to the beach for a late - night swim			0
shortly afterwards , the girl is found dead — apparently murdered			0
so begins a new tv mini-series , @entity5 , which starts on @entity7 television tonight			2
the plot is not , however , quite as formulaic as it sounds			0
the party and even the beach , it soon emerges , are on board a vast spaceship			0
as for the milestone being celebrated , it is the 51st anniversary of the original 600 - man @entity17 crew blasting off from @entity18 in a rocket powered by nuclear bombs			1
they are halfway through a 100 - year journey to colonise a planet so secret its existence was kept hidden from the public			0
in what must be one of the most incredible chapters of the space race , @entity17 , @entity7 and @entity51 scientists drew up plans in the late @entity57 and @entity58 for the @entity17 @entity59 to send a rocket the size of an ocean liner to other planets			1
it would get there by exploding thousands of small atomic bombs			1
@entity29 might now sound like the stuff of @entity67 — only infinitely more dangerous — but it was based on solid technical research and attracted some of the finest scientists of their generation , headed by a @entity7 physics and mathematics genius named @entity74			1
back in 1957 , when the @entity40 launched the first satellite , @entity76 1 , into space , the @entity17 was plunged into panic			1
president @entity79 was ready to say yes to just about any proposal that might give the @entity17 a lead in the space race			1
@entity29 was certainly the boldest			2
the plan originated from @entity84 , a cutting - edge technology company and defence contractor near @entity87 , @entity88			0
the idea of using atomic explosions to provide a rocket with thrust had been put forward a decade earlier by one of the architects of @entity17 ’s atom bomb project			1
the founders of @entity29 argued that it could propel the @entity17 far ahead of the @entity97			1
the original plan envisaged sending a 50 - strong crew as far as @entity37 , but to get the multi-million - dollar government backing required , the project needed a scientist of international fame			0
a maths prodigy who would calculate the number of atoms in the @entity108 when he was four , @entity74 was later involved in strategic planning for the @entity111 ’s wartime bombing of @entity112			2
he ’d been given a job for life at @entity115 when he was asked to join @entity29			2
the ultra-secret project was named after the highly - visible , recognisable constellation former @entity17 president @entity79 ( left ) said yes to the original @entity29 proposal while his successor , president @entity121 ( right ) , was ' reportedly appalled by the thought of a new space weapons race ' when he was presented with blueprints for a floating military fortress inspired by the atomic bomb - driven rocket @entity130 nuclear testing in the @entity131			1
the scientists behind @entity29 envisioned propelling it through space by exploding thousands of small atomic bombs diagram describing the three - stage rocket which lifted @entity76 into orbit			1
the launch of the satellite is what prompted the @entity140 to begin 1			0
first stage engine illustration appeared in the @entity153 and was obtained by the @entity154 in 1957 @entity74 needed little persuasion : since childhood he had dreamed of travelling into space			1
he did a few calculations before announcing that , yes , he thought it could be done , and he and @entity160 , @entity29 ’s project leader , recruited a 50 - strong team of scientists			1
many of them had worked on developing the bombs that had devastated @entity166 and @entity167			0
like @entity74 , they were driven by a high - minded hope that nuclear bombs could now be harnessed for good rather than destruction			1
what was special on paper about the @entity29 concept was that it not only provided a rocket with enormous thrust , but also the fuel was very efficient			1
conventionally powered rockets wasted so much fuel just to get into orbit , and travelled so slowly , relatively speaking , that they could n’t get anywhere useful in space in their crews ’ lifetime — even if they had room for the necessary fuel			0
its disciples argued that nuclear pulse propulsion , as it was called , was the only known technology that provided the thrust and speed to get to other planets and back in a matter of years			0
even in those days of starry - eyed enthusiasm for atomic energy ’s potential , the scientists knew they had to overcome a forbidding array of technical challenges			2
the spaceship would be propelled by a series of explosions from highly directed nuclear bombs dropped out of the back of the bullet - shaped rocket , each instantly generating temperatures many times hotter than the @entity108 would n’t the explosions simply vaporise the rocket ? apparently not			2
tests with high - explosive fuel showed it could propel a scaled - down rocket up into the sky without destroying it			2
obviously , an atomic bomb would create a far more powerful explosion than @entity218			0
the bombs would drop out of the rocket in their thousands , one after the other , exploding some 20 metres behind it			1
one of @entity74 ’s most taxing problems was getting a level of acceleration that would be tolerable for humans			2
consequently , the @entity29 would be protected by a 1,000 - ton and immensely thick steel ‘ pusher plate ’ , bolstered by shock absorbers , that would absorb the brunt of the explosion while propelling the rocket forwards			1
the scientists calculated it would take nearly 1,000 nuclear explosions to get into space , and thousands more bombs to accelerate it to its cruising speed of 50,000 mph			1
simply lining up and ejecting the bombs correctly would be tricky			0
looking for inspiration , the @entity29 teams consulted the @entity242 for insights on its @entity245 bottle production lines			2
as for the rocket ’s living quarters , the enormous power of its fuel source meant the spaceship could be as big and heavy as its designers liked			0
various orions were envisaged , their size depending on the length of their intended journey			0
the original design was one weighing 4,000 tons and as tall as a ten - storey building			0
however , a ‘ @entity260 ’ that might get even further than @entity261 had a diameter of 400 metres and weighed eight million tons			0
it had enough room for thousands of passengers			0
even on the smaller spaceships , the interior and fittings would include reading rooms , kitchens and lounger chairs for the astronauts to relax in comfort			0
everything would be built from steel , and drawings show the interior looking more like a rather spacious submarine than a conventional cramped rocket			0
even then , there were concerns about radiation , although @entity29 ’s leaders claimed that fallout could be reduced to nothing if advanced nuclear fusion technology was used ( where two or more atoms are fused into a larger one ) rather than the conventional fission ( when one atom is split )			2
the intention was to launch at least the smaller @entity29 rockets from huge barges far out at sea			2
today , surviving @entity29 scientists still go misty - eyed as they describe what a launch would have looked like — the mother of all firework displays as the huge rocket soared into the sky thanks to a series of progressively bigger explosions			1
unlike the @entity29 rocket , the @entity300 actually made it into orbit an area of the southern @entity305 containing @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity308 and @entity309			1
@entity7 physics and mathematics genius @entity74 dreamed up a nuclear - powered spaceship that he believed could travel 4.37 light years away and reach @entity313 but where was it going to go ? ‘ @entity37 by 1965 , and @entity261 by 1970 was the slogan we went by , ’ said @entity74 , now 91 and living in the @entity17 the team envisaged a four - year return trip to one of @entity261 ’s colonisable moons , where the itinerary would include time to explore the surface , try to grow some crops and then return to @entity18			1
@entity74 later unveiled two concepts for an even vaster nuclear - powered spaceship that he believed could reach @entity313 , 4.37 light years away and the nearest star system to the @entity108 this image sequence shows the explosion of the first atomic bomb during the @entity333 test in @entity334 in 1945			1
atomic bombs would have propelled @entity29 if the project had ever gotten off the ground @entity74 ’s rocket would take as little as 133 years to get there , but would cost $ 3.67 trillion — or @entity17 ’s annual gross national product in the late @entity58			1
the premise of tv ’s @entity5 is that the interstellar expedition is never revealed to the public			0
in reality , we can be fairly certain @entity29 never happened			2
it was , to some extent , a victim of its own success			0
@entity29 ’s @entity350 paymasters realised its enormous military implications			2
the generals ordered plans for a floating fortress rather like the @entity355 in @entity356 , bristling with nuclear weapons and orbiting above @entity97			0
the blueprints were presented to president @entity121 , who was reportedly appalled by the thought of a new space weapons race			0
the last straw was the 1963 treaty signed by the @entity17 , the @entity7 and the @entity40 , which banned all but underground nuclear tests			1
by then , even @entity74 was getting cold feet , after calculating that as many as ten people would die from the atomic fallout every time a rocket was launched			1
# the project was quietly killed off at the beginning of 1965			1
@entity74 still looks back fondly on what he insists would have been a major leap forward for human technology			0
‘ we were a bunch of crazies in a way , ’ he said of the @entity29 team			0
‘ and it was an unusual time , when crazy people were given a chance to do their stuff			0
’ @entity383 , a three - part mini series , starts on @entity385 at 9pm tonight .			1

@entity385 *'s* @entity387 is based on a @entity17 defence project called @entity29
project began after @entity76 i was launched by the @entity40 in 1957
scientists , including @entity7 physicist @entity74 , planned to propel a giant rocket through space by exploding thousands of mini atomic bombs
the project was quietly killed off at the beginning of 1965
