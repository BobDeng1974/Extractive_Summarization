the air we breathe is laced with cancer - causing substances and is being officially classified as carcinogenic to humans , the @entity0 has said			2
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) said that in 2010 , 223,000 deaths from lung cancer worldwide resulted from air pollution			1
the agency also said that there is convincing evidence it increases the risk of bladder cancer			1
motorists travel through haze in @entity17 , @entity18			0
air pollution has been named as the main cause of lung cancer by the @entity0 it listed the main sources of outdoor air pollution as transport , power generation , industrial and agricultural emissions , and heating and cooking in residential buildings			1
some air pollutants also have natural sources , it added			0
air pollution is already known to increase risks for a wide range of diseases , such as respiratory and heart diseases			2
depending on the level of exposure in different parts of the world , the risk was found to be similar to that of breathing in second - hand tobacco smoke , @entity40 , head of the agency 's section that ranks carcinogens , told reporters in @entity52			0
in a statement , deputy head of the @entity0 cancer agency , @entity55 , said : ' our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants			2
' the results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction : the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution			1
' air pollution , mostly caused by transport , power generation , industrial or agricultural emissions and residential heating and cooking , is already known to raise risks for a wide range of illnesses including respiratory and heart diseases			1
research suggests that exposure levels have risen significantly in some parts of the world , particularly countries with large populations going through rapid industrialisation , such as @entity86			0
air pollution has also been linked to bladder cancer by the @entity0 @entity6 reviewed thousands of studies on air pollution tracking populations over decades and other research such as those in which mice exposed to polluted air experienced increased numbers of lung tumours			1
in a statement released after reviewing the literature , the @entity100 - based agency said both air pollution and particulate matter - a major component of it - would now be classified among its @entity107 human carcinogens			2
that ranks them alongside more than 100 other known cancer - causing substances in @entity6 's @entity107 , including asbestos , plutonium , silica dust , ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke			0
dr. @entity117 , director of @entity6 , told a news briefing in @entity52 that the work 's aim is to be as comprehensive as possible			0
he said : ' often we 're looking at two , three or four decades once an exposure is introduced before there is sufficient impact on the burden of cancer in the population to be able to study this type of question			0

in 2010 , air pollution caused the deaths of 223,000 lung cancer *patients* , according to the @entity0
there is also ' convincing evidence ' it increases risk of bladder cancer
main sources of outdoor air pollution are transport , power generation , industrial and agricultural emissions
in residential buildings , heating and cooking are to blame
