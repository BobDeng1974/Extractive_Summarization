students at @entity11 in @entity12 were sent home on friday after the pests found their way through vents in a new classroom block			1
the mites spread through the school and jumped across tables - leaving staff and pupils with sore and itchy bites			1
infestation : @entity11 in @entity12 has been forced to close for a second time after its first attempt to rid its £ 6million grass eco-roof ( above ) of a mite infestation has failed to stop them biting children ongoing issue : the mites have spread through the 700 - pupil secondary school in @entity31 - leaving staff and pupils with sore and itchy bites the 700 - pupil @entity31 secondary school reopened on monday after a full - scale fumigation was thought to have cleared up the problem			1
however , students have now been sent home for a second time after it became apparent that the bugs - believed to be harvest mites - were still biting children			1
@entity42 , whose daughter attends the school , said she felt its duty of care to students had been ' breached '			1
she said : ' they knew about this a week ago			0
parents should have been told earlier			0
it should n't have reopened until it was sorted			2
' irritable : harvest mites sink in a small feeding barb to their victims and secrete a fluid into the wound			2
their bites cause extremely irritating heat lumps which can last up to fourteen days the influx of mites is believed to have emerged from the school 's £ 6million eco extension , which comprises of ten classrooms and a new sports hall			1
it opened 12 months ago , featuring ‘ natural ventilation ’ and a sedum grass roof			1
the school 's chairman of governors @entity70 said : ' on friday afternoon , the interior of the building was treated by our contractor			1
the effect of this was assessed on saturday afternoon and again on sunday			0
' these mites are extremely small and as far as could be discerned it appeared that the issue had been dealt with			2
' however , upon reopening it became apparent that pupils were still being affected and the problem remained			2
unfortunately we had to make the decision to reclose the school			2
' eco-friendly : supporters of grass roofs say they provide efficient insulation while reducing rainwater run - off and providing a home for wildlife harvest mites , which favour sheltered areas of the body , sink in a small feeding barb to their victims and secrete a fluid into the wound which breaks down the human cells into food			2
their bites cause extremely irritating heat lumps , which can last up to fourteen days a spokesman for @entity107 said : ' although a bite can be itchy and uncomfortable , harvest mites in the @entity109 do not carry any diseases that present a risk to humans			1

this month , families have voiced their concerns about a £ 7million ' eco primary school ' that , despite opening only three years ago , has started leaking so badly pupils have been forced to go into temporary classrooms for two years			1
controversial : @entity139 ( above ) has started leaking so badly that pupils have been forced to go into temporary classrooms for two years when @entity139 in @entity142 opened its timber doors in 2010 , it was applauded for its environmentally friendly credentials			1
it was heated by solar power and its plumbing system relied on rain collected from the roof , which was made of locally - grown sweet chestnut			2
however , the zero - carbon building turned out to be not quite as sustainable as the designers had hoped			0
now , a series of water leaks and mouldy walls have left pupils having to be taught in tents erected in the school grounds			1
@entity159 , whose son attends the school , near @entity162 , said : ‘ there ’s been leaking there ever since it opened			0
last year we could see the roof was starting to warp			0
' i went to a parents ’ lunch and you could see these large patches of mould			0
my ex-partner is a builder and he could n’t understand how it could get that bad			0
’ meanwhile , a @entity178 ' eco primary school ' has banned pupils from bringing their bikes through the gates because of health and safety concerns			1
students at @entity185 in @entity186 have been told they must chain their bikes up off its premises amid plans to demolish cycle racks to make way for more staff parking			0
mother @entity193 , 32 , has three 10 - year - olds at the school and admitted she was surprised staff had taken the decision considering its ' eco ' status			1
' the school is an eco-friendly school but has decided that children are no longer allowed to cycle to and from school , even though children have been doing this for years , including myself as a child , ' said the mother , whose children normally cycle together with four others , cutting their twenty minute walk down to a five - minute bike ride			0
' this has upset a lot of children and their parents			0
childhood obesity is on the rise and promoting healthy eating and exercise is a must			0
