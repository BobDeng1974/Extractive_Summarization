@entity2 's @entity1 team will face a rematch with the @entity4 in the first round of the @entity1 next march			1
@entity2 secured their place at the elite level of the competition for a second consecutive season by upsetting @entity4 in @entity10 in february and then lost narrowly to @entity11 in the quarter - finals			1
because @entity2 played on @entity4 soil the last time the two teams met , this tie will be played in @entity2 from march 6 - 8			1
@entity16 celebrates after beating @entity17 to clinch victory for @entity2 against @entity4 in february @entity4 had been favoured to win the last tie but their choice of clay backfired and @entity24 's victory over @entity17 coupled with two wins for @entity16 decided it			1
a home tie will not necessarily make @entity2 favourites this time , though , given @entity4 were without number one @entity30 last year			2
picking a surface will not be that easy for captain @entity32 and his team given the fast indoor court they have selected for home ties in the past would also suit the @entity4			0
and the prowess of the @entity4 ' doubles team of @entity40 means whoever is picked as number two singles player - probably @entity24 - will likely need to win a rubber			0
@entity24 is congratulated by @entity16 after beating @entity17 on the opening day of this year 's tie it will be @entity2 's first home match since april 2013 , when they recovered from a 2 - 0 deficit to stun @entity48 at @entity50 's @entity49			1
it remains to be seen what effect @entity16 's declaration of support for an independent @entity54 will have on his commitment to a @entity58 @entity1 team , although he has always stressed his pride at representing @entity2 in the past			1
the 27 - year - old played sporadically while @entity2 were in the lower reaches of the competition but has been an ever - present over the last three ties			2
@entity16 's loss to @entity11 's @entity66 in april was just his second in 19 singles rubbers , and he has committed to playing both singles and doubles to help @entity2 's cause			0
his doubles partner in two of the last three ties , fellow @entity74 @entity73 , has also backed independence , as has @entity16 's brother @entity77 , with whom he has previously played in the competition			0
@entity16 ( 6th left ) celebrates with the rest of the @entity81 team after victory in @entity83 in 2013 having said following his @entity85 victory last summer that he would make his position public despite not having a vote , @entity16 reversed that in march , citing the long - running fall - out from his 2006 joke about supporting ' anyone but @entity92 ' @entity91 the @entity93			0
however , only a matter of hours before the polls opened , @entity16 wrote on @entity96 : " huge day for @entity54 today ! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it			2
excited to see the outcome			0
lets do this ! " @entity16 said during the recent @entity102 that he would expect to represent @entity54 at the @entity103 in 2016 should there be a ' yes ' vote			0
the question of what would happen to the @entity1 team in that instance has not really been addressed , but it could be that a unified @entity58 team remains in place			0
victory for @entity2 over the @entity4 would mean another home tie against either top seeds @entity115 or @entity116 in july , while the pick of the other first - round ties are derby matches between @entity120 and @entity121 and @entity122 and @entity83			2
@entity116 v @entity115 @entity2 v @entity4 @entity124 v @entity123 @entity125 v @entity11 @entity120 v @entity121 @entity122 v @entity83 @entity127 v @entity126 @entity129 v @entity128 ties to be played on march 6 - 8			1

@entity2 have been drawn against @entity4 for the second consecutive year
the tie will be played in @entity2 on march 6 - 8 , 2015
it comes on the same day that @entity16 tweeted his support for @entity54 independence
