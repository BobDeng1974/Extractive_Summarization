@entity0 , 51 , was left petrified to leave her home after she suffered recurring violent incidents in her line of work as a bookmaker in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , forcing her to leave her job four years ago			1
afraid to leave the house without her husband or daughters , @entity0 resorted to comfort eating and her weight soared to 18 - and - a - half stones			1
before and after : super slimmer @entity0 lost a staggering seven stone after being held at gun point while working as a bookmaker drove her to comfort eating finally , after encouragement from her youngest daughter @entity41 , 25 , @entity0 - who was also suffering from post traumatic stress , sleep apnoea and high blood pressure - joined @entity8			1
now , just 18 months later , @entity0 has escaped from her own virtual prison as a confident and independent woman - and a svelte seven stones lighter			1
mother - of - three @entity0 said : ' the first incident was when i was going to bank the takings from the bookmakers			1
i was jumped from behind			2
' six weeks after that i was working in the shop when someone barged in and started pointing something at me			2
' i thought it was a gun so i threw myself on the floor			2
next i heard the man laughing and leaving the shop with the cash from the till			2
' the next time , it was a real gun			2
i was petrified and i could n't go back into work after that			0
' comfort : after the attack @entity0 developed post-traumatic stress and would feast on chocolate none of the perpetrators were ever caught and @entity0 was diagnosed with post traumatic stress			1
she left her job of 11 years and became trapped inside her own home			1
she said : ' i started getting flashbacks and terrible nightmares			0
i could n't go out of the house because i would have panic attacks			2
' i found it difficult to even have family and friends round to our house and would sometimes have to retreat to my bedroom			0
helping hand : the mother - of - three was motivated to lose weight and join @entity8 by her daughter @entity41 ' @entity87 was my only comfort			1
i would eat when i was n't even hungry			0
i would n't have any proper meals because i could n't concentrate on cooking			0
' i just snacked on whatever was in the fridge			0
chocolate was my biggest downfall			2
' @entity0 joined @entity8 after taking inspiration from her daughter			1
' @entity41 joined in november 2010 and i 'd watched how she flourished , ' said @entity0			1
' i was becoming more worried about my health , and @entity41 encouraged me to go with her			0
' i was so nervous and just stayed by her side the whole night			0
but after a couple of weeks i started to look forward to going			0
all the women were lovely and they were so supportive			0
' gradually , as i went more , my confidence grew			0
i even started getting out and about , going for walks with my husband @entity102			0
such a difference : @entity0 has not only lost seven stone but she also feels happier , healthier and more independent ' for years , i had felt trapped , not only because i was embarrassed about my appearance but i was also terrified of being in other people 's company			1
' @entity0 has lost seven stone and a few weeks ago she went to the supermarket on her own for the first time			1
she said : ' when i got home , i had the most brilliant feeling			2
i was so proud of myself			0
i 'd always been independent until this happened , and then i started to rely on everybody else			0
but now i 'm starting to be my own person again			0
