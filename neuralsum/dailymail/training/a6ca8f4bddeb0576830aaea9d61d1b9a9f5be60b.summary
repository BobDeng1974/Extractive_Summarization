@entity0 may have claimed the bragging rights in tuesday night 's friendly at @entity2 but the seniors are by no means the only @entity0 side taking on @entity5 this week			1
the @entity6 face the @entity7 on thursday evening in their final @entity9 contest of the season - and they have a chance of lifting the trophy at @entity13 's @entity12			1
so far , @entity15 's young charges have lost 1 - 0 to @entity16 in @entity17 and beaten @entity18 1 - 0 thanks to a goal from @entity22 midfielder @entity21			1
@entity21 celebrates scoring @entity0 's winning goal in their @entity9 win over @entity18 @entity0 coach @entity15 is keen to give his young charges plenty of experience of international football those results have left them third in the standings ahead of the final round but a win , coupled with a favourable result in the @entity18 vs @entity16 match , will deliver @entity0 the trophy for the 36th time since its inception in 1946			1
however , the greatest concern for coach @entity15 is to give his schoolboy team valuable exposure to international football and put on an entertaining display for what is expected to be a large crowd in @entity46			1
he said : ' the players were really looking forward to meeting up for this game and relationships have already started to form which is great			2
' development is about individual talent but it is also about playing in a team			2
to do that we need to make sure the players bond - and they certainly are			2
@entity0 's @entity57 attempts an overhead kick during the 1 - 0 @entity9 defeat to @entity16 @entity0 's @entity60 ( left ) tries to break through the @entity18 defence ' we are working with 16 - year - olds who are on the start of an international journey and we need to be mindful of that			1
' our expectations need to be high but they need to be appropriate			2
we need to concentrate on the now but have an eye on the future as well			0
' with that in mind , @entity15 has recalled many of the squad members for the @entity16 and @entity18 matches , but there are first call - ups for @entity77 defender @entity76 and @entity78 forward @entity79			1
followers of youth football will notice some familiar surnames in the squad , including @entity84 of @entity85 , the brother of @entity87 , who is currently out on loan at @entity90			0
@entity91 , who plays for @entity78 , is the younger brother of @entity92 , also on the @entity94 ' books			0
it certainly wo n't have escaped the notice of these 15 and 16 - year - olds that @entity0 captain @entity98 earned his 100th international cap in the @entity101 qualifier against @entity102 at the weekend			1
but it will also be of great encouragement that @entity98 was once like them , playing for @entity0 in the 2001 @entity9 campaign and he netted his first goal in a @entity0 shirt - the first of many to come			1
@entity112 vies for the ball with @entity114 of @entity16 during @entity0 's slender defeat at @entity17 @entity0 's @entity116 tries to escape the clutches of two @entity18 defenders @entity98 stands alongside the likes of @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 as @entity0 players who have benefited from a footballing education in this competition			1
@entity128 recalled : ' the first game we played was against @entity16			1
i was on the bench and came on as a sub			0
i was disappointed because i wanted to start , i wanted to play up front , and i always remember the coach saying that i was n’t a centre - forward – he said i was a winger			0
the next game he played me as centre - forward from the start and i scored against @entity5			2
that was a nice moment			0
' i was a young lad , 15 , the game was on television and was something different to what i ’d been used to			0
all my family and friends were watching the game , so it was a big moment			0
once i ’d tasted that , being on tv playing football and everyone seeing what i could do , i just wanted more of it			0
' both of thursday night 's @entity9 matches are being screened live on @entity9 5 , with @entity18 vs @entity16 starting at 6pm and @entity0 vs @entity5 at 8pm			1
