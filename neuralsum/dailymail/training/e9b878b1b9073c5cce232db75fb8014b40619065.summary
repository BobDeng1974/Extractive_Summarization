@entity0 dismissed : a tribunal ruled @entity2 was right to sack @entity3 , pictured , after he grabbed a pupil who threw a milkshake at him a teacher who manhandled a student after the teenager hurled a banana milkshake at him along with a torrent of abuse has lost his claim for unfair dismissal			2
@entity3 , 59 , was sacked by governors at @entity2 in @entity15 after he was caught on @entity16 aggressively pinning the 16 - year - old 's arms to his sides in march 2011			1
mr @entity3 claimed he 'd been unfairly dismissed , but a @entity21 employment tribunal upheld the school 's decision , claiming the teacher 's reaction to the milkshake - throwing was over-the - top			1
' the witness statements from mr @entity3 's colleagues indicated that his behaviour had been inappropriate and excessive , ' the tribunal chairman said			1
he added that it was ' reasonable ' for governors to believe he had ' escalated the situation '			0
headteacher @entity35 said the school was thrilled the tribunal agreed mr @entity3 's actions amounted to gross misconduct			1
' we had no option but to dismiss him , ' she said			0
' two different ruling panels of governors at @entity2 , whose members included parents and trade union members , were unanimous in their belief that mr @entity3 's actions went far beyond restraining the pupil			1
' mr @entity3 was observed on @entity16 pushing the pupil down into the chair repeatedly with excessive force - enough force to move a large dining room table and chairs several feet			1
' but the it teacher , who claimed he tried to commit suicide after losing his job , said he wanted the decision reviewed and was considering a further appeal			2
he said : ' it was impossible to walk away from a situation where someone was threatening to throw a chair and it would have been negligent to ignore it			0
school : governors at @entity2 , pictured , are thrilled the tribunal upheld their decision ' there were plenty of witnesses to what happened and for some reason they were nâ€™t called but i want to speak to them			2
' i think this judgment sends out a message to pupils that they can do what they want to get a teacher sacked and this leaves staff in a very vulnerable position			1
' the school has completely ignored the government 's guidelines , which start with the premise that a teacher should be supported in these circumstances			2
' milkshake mayhem : the incident began when a 16 - year - old student threw a banana milkshake at mr @entity3 ( stock photo ) during the unfair dismissal case , the teacher told the tribunal that he had feared the boy was going to throw a chair at him			1
after he let the teenager go , the pupil did pick up a chair and threw it , although not at mr @entity3			2
neither the boy or his parents complained to the school , but the governors decided the man had to go			0
at a tribunal hearing in @entity21 last month , mr @entity3 said he had now been left ' unemployable ' and has twice attempted suicide			1
he also said he feared youngsters ' behaviour was getting ' out of control '			0
married mr @entity3 's 13 - year teaching career has been ended by the episode			1
he said during the hearing : ' it has had a huge impact on me			0
i ca n't get another job now and our financial situation is dire , to say the least			0
' in all other public buildings you see posters saying abusive language and behaviour will not be tolerated			0
that is not the case at @entity129			0
senior management at @entity129 do n't support staff in general at all			0
' today , mrs @entity35 said every teacher employed at her school was trained in techniques aimed at defusing situations of conflict			0
she said : ' mr @entity3 had every right to feel aggrieved by having milkshake thrown at him but , instead of putting this training into action , defusing the situation and reporting the incident , @entity16 footage shows he adopted a confrontational approach prior to the incident and allowed his anger to govern his actions			1
' we are determined to uphold the highest standards of behaviour and in no way condone the pupil 's behaviour towards teaching staff			2
' the pupil involved was excluded for four days and a clear message was sent to other children at the school that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated			0
' the commotion occurred last march in the school canteen when some boys were ' acting up ' in front of another teacher			0
mr @entity3 told one of them , a year 11 pupil , to sit down , at which point the teenager launched into a tirade of verbal abuse and then threw his banana milkshake over him .			1

@entity3 , 59 , was fired after being caught on @entity16 pinning the boy 's arms to his sides in march 2011
a @entity21 employment tribunal today claimed the 59 - year - old 's reaction was ' inappropriate and excessive ' and he *deserved* to lose his job
mr @entity3 said the judgement sends the *wrong* message to *troublesome* pupils and leaves staff in a ' vulnerable position '
