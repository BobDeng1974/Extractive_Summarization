@entity0 and his @entity2 team - mates were upset by the sloppy , uninspired way they started in @entity5 on tuesday night			1
nine months on from meeting at the @entity6 , the @entity2 faced the @entity5 once more in a glamour friendly at the @entity8			1
hopes were high after seven straight wins but @entity12 's men struggled in the first half , deservedly falling behind to a @entity15 header in @entity16			1
@entity2 captain @entity0 issues instructions during the 1 - 1 draw against @entity5 on tuesday night @entity0 said he and the rest of the @entity2 players were upset by their first half performance however , half - time brought with it renewed enthusiasm and @entity2 dominated the second period , levelling in style through @entity27 and going close to turning a 1 - 1 into an away triumph			1
' we have ( moved on from the @entity6 ) and i think that 's why we were so disappointed with the first half , ' @entity2 skipper @entity0 said			1
' we know we 're better than that			0
even though we had a lot of changes , we know we are a better team than what we showed first half			0
' we were upset , i 'll be honest , in the dressing room after the first half			2
everyone was upset with the way we performed			0
@entity0 and the rest of the @entity2 squad arrived back from @entity5 on wednesday after their flight was delayed the squad were supposed to fly home on tuesday night after the match but a technical fault caused delay ' it showed great character from everyone to go out in the second half to put in the performance we did , to get back in the game and were unlucky not to go on and win it			1
' @entity5 are a great team and i think one of their biggest strengths is seeing the game out			2
' we worked hard , we pushed the ball well , showed a lot of composure on the ball and created chances			0
' on another night we might have scored another goal , but i think overall probably a draw for both teams was a fair result in the way the game went			0
' @entity15 opened the scoring as @entity2 deservedly went behind in the first half against @entity5 @entity27 equalised for @entity12 's side during a much - improved second period things certainly ended positively for @entity2 , with @entity0 dovetailing well with full debutant @entity77 as @entity12 's second - half introductions stated their case			1
@entity80 was one of the stand - out performers , with the second - half substitute showing flashes of the form which impressed so many last summer			2
' @entity80 is a terrific player , ' @entity0 said			2
' he is a terrific young player and i think he can have an impact when he comes on			0
' he did that , he took the ball , he ran at the @entity89 defenders and made it difficult for them			0
' hopefully , he can kick on now for the rest of the season			0
