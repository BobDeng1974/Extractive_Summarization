by @entity0 published : 04:30 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 16:59 est , 19 september 2013 @entity1 missed : @entity2 as @entity3 and @entity4 as @entity5 are now parted forever @entity6 ’s @entity5 is in deep mourning			1
she spends her days in her bedroom , dressed in black or purple , staring at a framed photograph of her late husband , @entity11 , on the dressing table			1
‘ anyone who tries to lift me out of it has an almost impossible task on their hands , ’ says @entity4 , who plays the recently widowed @entity5 — and new mother of baby @entity14 — in the fourth series , which returns this weekend			1
‘ @entity5 has gone back to being as unapproachable as she was in the first series , but for a different reason , ’ says @entity4			1
‘ then , she was a very petulant , spoilt aristocrat , but over the years — and especially since she had known @entity11 — she softened			1
but now , in her grief , she has put the barriers back up again			2
’ the last time we saw the great house standing proudly on its manicured lawns , in a christmas day special , dark clouds were descending			0
dashing young @entity11 was killed when his open - top sports car crashed , just after the birth of @entity14 , heir to the family ’s estate			1
the new series begins six months after @entity11 ’s death in 1922 , with @entity5 still consumed by grief and wondering whether she will make a good mother and be able to bond with her fatherless son			1
even a consoling visit from the family ’s trusted butler , @entity40 , can not shake @entity5 out of her depression			2
can @entity43 , the wilful former chauffeur and widower of her sister @entity45 , be the one person who can bring happiness back into her life again ? ‘ although it ’s a dark period in @entity5 ’s life , i do enjoy playing that side of her , when she ’s got more of a sting in her tail , ’ says @entity4 , 31			2
bonding over their grief : @entity4 as @entity5 with son @entity14 and @entity55 as @entity43 with baby @entity56 as you will see , she ’s even quite brutal with @entity40 ( @entity58 ) , whom she had always turned to for guidance			1
‘ she ’s also very dismissive of caring @entity60 [ @entity61 ] , the head housemaid			0
she hurts people who want to help her			0
’ the death of @entity11 ( @entity2 ) shocked millions of viewers			1
it had been a well - kept secret , although @entity2 had for some time been signalling his intention to leave @entity6 and try his luck in @entity70			1
darker drama : @entity4 's @entity5 is struggling to escape her grief in season four - and even @entity4 felt her loss ‘ we ’d all signed up initially for three series of @entity6 , so the time was right for him to make his move , ’ says @entity4			1
‘ any of us could have made the same choice			0
‘ of course , i would have loved @entity2 to have stayed , but there does come a point where you have to make decisions about your career and what you want to do			2
‘ i was worried at first because without @entity2 the story had to change			2
his character was not only my husband , but the hopes for the family ’s estate were pinned on him			0
‘ it means that this new series has had to take a real turn , something @entity95 [ the @entity96 - winning writer ] had n’t bargained for			0
’ when @entity2 first said that he wanted to leave at the end of series three , @entity95 urged him to wait until a convenient moment arose in an early episode in series four			1
then he would write him out by sending @entity11 on a business trip to @entity103 , which would still leave the role open to him to return should things not work out later			2
he even offered to film some scenes in @entity108			0
but @entity2 was determined to move on , so @entity95 reluctantly had @entity11 make a dramatic exit in a fatal car crash — but not until the very end of the @entity113 episode , so that viewers would n’t be as upset as they would be if it had happened mid-way through the show			1
‘ i ’m not mourning @entity2 like @entity5 is for her husband , ’ says @entity4 , ‘ but i do miss him			1
we had become close and it has seemed strange without him			0
‘ it ’s the same with @entity121 , who played my sister @entity45 , who died soon after bearing her baby daughter			0
‘ we all spent so much time together , and suddenly they are not there			0
@entity5 feels isolated in her grief — and i ’m missing two good friends			1
’ grieving : both @entity5 and @entity4 suffers after the death of @entity2 ' @entity11 servant support : @entity5 turns on all her helpers , even her own maid @entity60 in loving memory : @entity5 struggles to bond with her son @entity14 following the death of @entity11 and passes him on to a wetnurse so what is the future for @entity5 ? it ’s clear , from the opening sequence of the new series , that it ’s likely to be a long time before she will receive gentlemen suitors			1
says @entity4 : ‘ @entity5 is nowhere near ready			2
i do n’t think it would be right for her to move on that swiftly — and the viewers would n’t like it , either			0
so you ’ll have to see			0
it ’s going to be a while			0
’ however , the gossip from the set is that there are admirers on the horizon			0
as @entity95 says : ‘ a lot of men will be interested in a beautiful , clever , well - connected woman with a big estate			0
women like that have a lot of pursuers			0
’ although she forms an alliance - through - grief with her brother - in - law @entity43 ( @entity164 ) , it is likely that their partnership will be more to do with fulfilling @entity11 ’s plans for modernising the estate , as well as sharing the problems of being single parents			1
‘ we are kindred spirits , but i am her rock , because her world has collapsed around her , ’ says @entity164			0
‘ that ’s all there is to it			0
’ one hotly - tipped candidate for @entity5 ’s eventual affections is lord @entity178 , an old family friend she ’s known since they were children , played by 28 - year - old @entity181 actor @entity180			2
another is the aristocratic @entity183 , a role taken by @entity186 actor @entity185 , and there is also speculation that @entity5 shows a keen interest in @entity191 jazz singer @entity190 , played by @entity192			2
‘ i ’m giving no clues , ’ says @entity4			0
‘ but all i will say is that although at the start of the series we see @entity5 reverting to being a glamorous ice princess , it will take a special man to make her melt			1
’ @entity6 , @entity201 , sunday 9pm .			2
