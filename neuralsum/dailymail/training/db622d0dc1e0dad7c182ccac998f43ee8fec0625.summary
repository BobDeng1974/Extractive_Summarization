by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 11:49 est , 15 october 2012 this is the jaw - dropping moment a young boy achieved what appears to be the world 's longest basketball shot			1
but rather than doing it from on the ground , the @entity7 youngster hit his target from 230 feet ( 70 metres ) up in the air			0
the astonishing video was filmed at a ski jump tower in @entity14 , @entity7			1
amazingly , his shot goes into the basket far below , and he shouts and bangs the side of his tower in delight			1
the boys made 19 attempts at their stunt before getting it right on the 20th try			2
' this video is gon na be a hit , ' writes one @entity53 user			0
the brief description beneath the video , posted on saturday but thought to have been filmed two years ago , stresses that the shot beats the record set by how ridiculous - an @entity58 foursome who sank a shot from 219.5ft ( 66.89m ) up at @entity62 's @entity61			1
the @entity64 world record for the longest successful basketball shot is 104ft 7in ( 31.9m ) , set by @entity66 at @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69			1
breathtaking : the ball fades from view over the dense @entity7 forest in the display of stunning skill sheer genius : after a substantial pause , the pinprick grows larger as the ball speeds towards the basket overjoyed : the unnamed boy shouts and bangs the tower 's wall as he achieves the remarkable shot other basketball records include the most free throws in one minute - 39 , by @entity86 ( @entity87 ) at @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90			2
how @entity91 have lobbed balls off the top of all sorts of high structures in @entity62 , as well as performing bizarre stunts in the gym and on the football field			0
their exploits include using exercise balls to bounce the ball into the net and kicking a ball over a bar and into a basket in an extremely tough - looking trick			0
they have also made videos of themselves catching a frisbee while jumping off a speedboat and getting a hole - in - one on a golf course - with a throw			0
exceptional : the lone boy appears to have beaten the official record set by an @entity58 group who perform crazy sporting stunts all year round perhaps the most bizarre clips show them hitting an egg with a boomerang and knocking an ice cream out of someone 's hand			1
now it appears that one of their craziest sporting stunts has been beaten by a very talented child			0
a spokesman for @entity133 said : ' [ there ] is an existing record for the greatest height from which a basketball has been shot			2
the measurement was 66.89 m by @entity139 of how ridiculous in @entity62 , @entity58 , on 8 april 2011			2
' @entity140 and three teammates from the how ridiculous team of basketball trick shot artists spent more than two - and - a - half hours attempting shots from the top of a light tower at the @entity149 ground			1
' the @entity7 claim remains unverified			0
we look forward to receiving their evidence so we can investigate			0
' video : watch the unverified record - breaking shot here ... video : watch the previous highest basketball shot here ...			1

sank the shot from 230ft up at the top of a ski jump tower
appears to have broken previous record set by @entity58 stunt group
