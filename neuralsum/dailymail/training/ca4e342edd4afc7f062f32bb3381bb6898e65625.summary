@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for @entity4			2
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
the glorious germans i 've been reading through the weeks that @entity12 are not an outstanding team – just a good team			1
many experts have talked them down and i can not understand it			1
for me , they are a completely different class – and they proved it on sunday night by winning the @entity18 in extra time against @entity20			1
on top of the world : @entity23 holds the @entity18 trophy aloft after @entity12 beat @entity20 1 - 0 man of the moment : @entity12 forward @entity27 ( centre ) celebrates after scoring the winner at @entity30 they do n't have any wing wizards , magical no 10s , or match - winners like @entity35 or @entity36			1
in @entity39 this season , @entity37 won the league without the so - called @entity41 and pin - up poster boys , but with a high work ethic , unity , discipline and a willingness to stand man - to - man with the opposition to compete			1
they excelled with a fierce desire and they played with pace and passion			2
i guess the experts would say they are a good team , because they do n't have the fancy @entity57 who flick it and tip - tap it around the half - way line			1
@entity12 remind me of @entity37			1
they are well - drilled , competitive and have pace throughout the team			1
i love the way they play , i love their attitude			2
they are like a @entity72 : oozing quality , good on the eye and they can run all day			2
for me , they are outstanding			1
kiss for the cup : @entity12 goalkeeper @entity77 kisses the @entity18 trophy as his team - mates look on party time : @entity81 ( bottom ) celebrates along with members of the @entity12 backroom team @entity85 at @entity87 last summer , technical director @entity86 was the key man in recruiting and spending the cash they got from @entity91 's world record transfer			1
most of those players were not @entity95 's choice and for a manager , having players bought for you who you do n't think are good enough is extremely difficult			1
the powers that be will constantly question why they 're not playing and if you lose , the clamp around you gets tighter and tighter			2
on the lookout : @entity87 technical director @entity86 was the key man in spending the club 's cash the squeeze of pressure grows and the manager starts to feel the heat			1
some managers end up playing people they do n't think are good enough to satisfy the people upstairs			2
@entity95 last season had no chance			2
the players would 've known that he was unhappy ; that he was stressed and he was fielding players who were quite clearly not good enough			2
that 's what you can get with a director of football who goes off and buys only the players that he wants			2
back for more : @entity126 manager @entity125 ( centre ) returned to the training pitch last week key role : @entity130 is @entity125 ' chief scout at @entity126 at @entity126 it is very different			1
@entity125 is in complete control			1
his chief scout and main man for recruiting is @entity130			0
@entity130 was a player at @entity136 and he has an encyclopedic knowledge of players all over the world			0
@entity125 took him from @entity140 and he is a @entity141			1
they have built up a fantastic network of scouts and @entity130 collects air miles like i collect @entity148 points			0
these players would 've all been analysed , moneyball - style , and no - one would 've been brought in at @entity150 without @entity125 's approval			1
it is the only way it can work			0
at one club i worked at , the chairman had signed five players , four of whom were nowhere near good enough			2
i nodded and agreed , then did n't play them			0
within six weeks i 'd got the bullet			0
@entity159 when i was a boy growing up i loved watching tennis at @entity161			0
in those days the two great players were @entity163 and @entity164			0
@entity163 always wore @entity166 gear with his @entity168 trainers and @entity164 had on his @entity170 kit and @entity172 trainers			0
this was back when they played with brown wooden rackets			0
@entity163 was relaxed , had very few expressions , silent assassin eyes and was calmness personified			0
controversy : @entity179 was banned from world football for four months after biting @entity181 @entity164 beat himself up if he lost any point			1
smashing his racket on the ground , on his head or on anything nearby			0
any decision that went the wrong way , the line judge or the umpire got it with both barrels			2
his eyes were viscous and he was mr @entity194			0
he never had a good word to say about anybody and i loved him			0
he was a character , he was different and he was mad			0
you can not be serious : tennis player @entity164 was renowned for his tantrums on the court @entity179 fits into that @entity164 bracket			1
he can display extreme brilliance and magic on the football pitch , but then his mind goes and he does something no - one can believe			2
i personally feel he overstepped the mark once too often , however brilliant he is , and believe @entity126 have made the right decision to move him on			1
incident : @entity179 controversially bites @entity211 's @entity181 during the @entity18 match in @entity213 last month @entity214 will fit in at @entity216 - @entity215 my week ... i spent my saturday afternoon basking in the sunshine sat next to the legend @entity218 as @entity219 visited @entity6 for a pre-season friendly			1
his energy , enthusiasm and knowledge of the game was quite amazing			0
he knew every single one of my players ; where they came from , their ages , he knew the lot			0
then the guy sat in front also started commenting and telling me the ages of our players and where they had been before			0
over there : @entity6 manager @entity237 ( left ) gestures as he stands beside player - coach @entity238 during the friendly against @entity219 on saturday i thought , ' who the hell is this @entity243 man ? ' until he turned around with his skinhead , windscreen - sized sunglasses , smiled at me and introduced himself as @entity246 , the chairman of @entity219			1
between them they have unearthed many good young players from the lower divisions			0
look out for the wizard @entity252 next season			0
he is a 5ft 3ins attacking midfield player they have just signed from @entity257			0
watching on : @entity219 chairman @entity246 ( left ) is pictured at the game with wife @entity259 we lost the friendly 1 - 0 and he ran the show			1
@entity262 – he is magic and he is well worth the admission money alone for any football supporter			0
he only comes up to my knees , but he is quick			0
you wait until you see him .			0

@entity12 beat @entity20 1 - 0 in the @entity18 final at @entity30
@entity273 's side are outstanding despite what many experts say
@entity126 manager @entity125 is in complete control of summer transfers
the @entity150 club have made the right decision to move @entity179 on to @entity216
@entity6 lost 1 - 0 to @entity219 in a pre-season friendly on saturday
