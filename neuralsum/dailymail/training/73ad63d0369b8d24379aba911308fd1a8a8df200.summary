by @entity0 published : 15:01 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 16:04 est , 9 september 2013 a hilarious new video has emerged of a pet cat attempting to play a game of ‘ cat - and - mouse ’ with a car ’s windshield wiper			1
the cat – a gray and white @entity8 – is called @entity10 and is enjoying pride of place sitting on the dashboard of the car when it starts to rain			2
the driver turns on the windshield wipers which gently starts to move back and forth			0
in between her sudden movements , the cat also tries to act like a cool customer and does some essential grooming , but she ca n’t resist another attempt to catch the wiper – seemingly unaware that it is actually on the other side of the glass			0
according to a comment posted with the video on @entity45 , the cat is called @entity46 and she enjoys nothing better than ‘ playing with anything that moves			1
’ she certainly displays her lightening quick reflexes in the video as she repeatedly follows the wiper all the way across the window while managing to expertly retain her balance			2
