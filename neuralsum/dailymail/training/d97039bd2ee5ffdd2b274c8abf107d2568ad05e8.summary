by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 23 january 2013 when @entity2 lost his hand in a jet - ski accident four years ago , he thought his career as a self - employed engineer was over			1
but he can now climb ladders , grip a length of rope and even do complex wiring , after he was fitted with a new generation of bionic hand			1
he is the first person in the @entity13 to have a ' @entity14 ' - a unique prosthetic that has electronic fingers and thumb			1
the £ 47,000 device has electrodes which sense movement in the muscles and , in turn , triggers signals that are sent to the hand			2
it is turned on and off by pressing a button on the upper part of the hand			0
mr @entity2 can now hold and grip different - sized objects and perform simple domestic tasks most people take for granted , such as doing up a button or picking up a set of keys			1
the service engineer lost his right hand when he fell off a jet - ski in a horrific accident in the sea off @entity49 , @entity50 , in 2009			1
he had been gripping a length of rope that was pulling his son on a rubber ring when a large wave struck the craft			0
as @entity2 was thrown into the water , the rope tightened and ripped his hand clean off			1
since then he has experimented with a rudimentary @entity61 prosthetic hand but then found out about the revolutionary ' @entity14 ' that had been developed in the @entity63 and @entity64			0
mr @entity2 was referred to the renowned private clinic @entity22 which is trialling the new device and has become the first to be fitted with it			1
scroll down for the video ... @entity2 puts on the bionic hand : the prosthetic comes in two parts that are clipped together @entity2 can now enjoy everyday chores , like ironing after mastering how to use his bionic hand			1
he can now grip a number of different sized objects mr @entity2 can use the bionic hand for precise tasks allowing him to carry out complex wiring work for his job as a service engineer the limb gets its name from the @entity85 artist 's famous painting of the hands of @entity87 and @entity88 touching			1
the married father - of - three from @entity90 , @entity50 , said after his accident he had been fitted with an @entity61 hand , but it had limited functionality			1
he searched online for an alternative and came across the @entity14 , which he was able to afford thanks to an insurance payout			0
he said : ' i was attracted to the new technology in it , the fact it had a silicone socket that would fit my arm better , the overall look of it and that the thumb could be controlled electronically			0
' i am really pleased that i have now been fitted with it			0
it is going to be a learning curve because i have been used to not having a hand for some time now			0
' it will make a huge difference to my life			0
now i have got something on the end of my arm that actually works			0
' it obviously is n't quite as good as a normal hand but it is much better than what i had			0
i can pick things up and do things that everybody takes for granted			0
' it is quite a weird feeling moving it and being able to do something i could n't for quite a long time			0
' the @entity126 is attached to a socket embedded with the electrodes , that detect muscle movement			0
the electronic signals are then read by a piece of software which controls the hand and make it open , close , or grip			2
the limb is made from a variety of metal , alloys and plastic , and wearers will require sessions with an occupational therapist to refine the movements			0
the hand , developed by @entity146 , moves its fingers and thumb when it detect muscle movement in the wearer 's arm stump the hand can make seven different hand positions thanks to four movable fingers and a thumb that can be separately positioned using muscle signals users are recommended to charge the hand every evening for approximately four hours , and can use it for 20 hours at a time			1
it costs £ 47,125 which includes the silicone socket , a five year warranty , and therapist sessions			0
@entity165 , the managing director of @entity22 , said : ' what sets this apart from any other prosthetic hand is it is far more intelligent and it has a motorised thumb			2
' with an able - bodied person , if the brain says ' close your hand ' it sends a message to the hand without thinking			1
' this hand has a built - in software programme that does the same thing , it 's just that there is no human hand there			2
but it has sensors that send the message from the muscles in the forearm to the hand			0
' as a result the wrist , fingers and thumb can respond in a much more accurate and faster way than any other hand			1
' prosthetic hands have been around for 30 years but this is the only one that has a motorised thumb which can move and grip by itself			2
' you have to move the thumb into position with your working hand with the other limbs			2
' mr @entity2 's hand has a five - year warranty life changing : mr @entity2 shows off his replacement £ 47,000 limb by specialists @entity22 it was developed by @entity146 , a @entity64 company that manufactures prosthetic limbs			1
@entity214 , business manager at @entity146 , said : ' this is a myoelectric hand which is operated by electronic impulses given out from the muscles in the residual limb			1
' as the muscles contract , there are electrodes on the skin that put out a signal and in turn , operate the hand			0
' it is made out of metals , alloys , and plastics , and what is different about this hand is it mimics human movement more so than any other electronic hand			2
' it is the first hand with a thumb that can be moved electronically like this , and it is very quick and natural			2
' this is good for @entity2 because a lot of his work is up on ladders and it will respond as he needs to use it , he will find it comfortable and tasks will be a lot easier			2
' @entity2 lost his right hand when he fell off a jet - ski in 2009			1

@entity2 , *58* , lost his right hand three years ago in a jet - ski accident
first person in @entity13 fitted with bionic limb with electronic fingers and thumb
