annoucement : the @entity3 and @entity4 on their wedding day - a first - born daughter of the @entity3 and @entity4 will become queen even if she is born before new laws have been passed , @entity1 said yesterday speaking in the @entity27 , mr @entity1 said : “ if the birds and bees were to deliver that blessing to the @entity3 and @entity4 , and indeed the nation , then that little girl would be covered by the provisions of these changes of the rules of succession because they operate from the time of the declaration of the @entity12 summit last october			1
‘ it is very important to remember that the rules are de facto in place , even though they have yet to be implemented through legislation in the way that i have described			0
’ birth : speaking in the @entity27 , mr @entity1 said that the girl ' would be covered by the provisions of these changes of the rules of succession ' a source close to mr @entity1 said the change in rules was needed now because it would take too long to wait for each of the 16 @entity12 countries affected to pass a new law			1
mr @entity1 ’s comments came after a question from @entity59 mp @entity58			0
the mp for @entity61 and the @entity62 said : ‘ if the birds and the bees of the very romantic isle of @entity65 were to conspire and bless our future @entity66 of @entity68 and his wife with the patter of tiny feet before this law was enacted , and if that royal baby turned out to be a little girl , would she succeed to the throne ? ’ the rule change was given fresh urgency by the marriage of @entity78 and @entity4 - as it could have provoked a constitutional crisis if their first child is a girl			2
but there are fears that the change could fuel the republican movement in @entity14 , where campaigners could use the opportunity to amend legislation to oust the @entity89			2
the current law of male primogeniture only allows @entity89 to be queen because she did not have any brothers			2
rules : the current law of male primogeniture only allows @entity89 , pictured at the @entity95 , to be queen because she did not have any brothers it also means that the princess royal , the @entity89 ’s second born , is just tenth in line to the throne behind her younger brothers @entity103 ( fourth ) and @entity104 ( seventh )			1
in @entity106 , the @entity105 was rocked by a public backlash over succession laws favouring men when @entity110 and @entity111 had a girl , @entity112 , princess @entity112			0
the 15 other countries where @entity89 is queen are @entity14 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , the @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , the @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and the @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , and @entity130 and @entity131			0
the @entity12 leaders also agreed to overturn the @entity133 , which means that only the @entity135 heirs of the @entity136 , granddaughter of @entity137 , can become king or queen			1
the law was brought in following the @entity141 - when a @entity143 invasion helped overthrow a @entity147 king - so that a @entity144 could never sit on our throne again .			0
