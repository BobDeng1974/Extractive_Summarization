@entity0 went range hitting before displaying plenty of attacking intent off the field in backing his coach and under - performing no 3 and then defending his decision not to sing the national anthem at this @entity8			1
plenty of sixes were hit in practice at the @entity12 before @entity0 , who showed glimpses of a return to form in @entity17 ’s win over @entity18 , aimed a couple of big verbal blows in standing up for @entity21 and @entity22			1
then the @entity24 captain of @entity17 addressed his reluctance to join in with @entity26 ahead of each game , in contrast to the bulk of his side who have been belting it out with gusto			1
@entity17 captain @entity0 passes the ball in a game of touch rugby during an @entity17 nets session @entity39 offloads the ball as @entity17 take a break from their nets session in @entity43 @entity0 took part in practising his big shots at the @entity12 in @entity43 @entity0 and his @entity17 team - mates were training ahead of sunday 's game with @entity48 @entity17 face @entity48 on saturday and the captain was robust in his defence of @entity51 even though he has looked rusty in scoring 10 in each of his three @entity8 games since being brought in at the last minute			1
@entity55 has been ‘ knocking hard on the door ’ according to batting coach @entity56 and @entity17 , it seems , will wait until the last minute before they decide whether to stick or twist again , after ripping up their @entity8 plans on the eve of their first game			1
‘ we ’re three games into a @entity8 , ’ said @entity0 , who has been given the team he wants in this tournament			1
‘ @entity22 came into the side four games ago and scored 70 ( it was actually 57 in the final warm - up match against @entity68 )			1
‘ he has played against two of the toughest teams in the @entity8 and then dragged one on against @entity18			0
in my eyes he has been a bit unlucky			0
he has n’t played a lot of cricket over the last month and i think any criticism of him at the moment is unfair			2
he ’s a fantastic cricketer and has a huge amount of potential			0
’ @entity0 charges up the field as @entity17 swapped the cricket ball for a rugby ball in the nets session @entity0 defended his decision not to join the rest of his team - mates in singing @entity26 @entity22 has looked out of form @entity22 was left out of the one - day tour of @entity48 before @entity89 and then broke his finger in practice when @entity17 first arrived in @entity92 , so he has been playing catch - up in this tournament			1
he showed last summer that he is on his way to becoming a special @entity97 player and @entity17 believe that , in time , a batsman who averages more than 50 in domestic one - day cricket can be similarly effective at international level			2
the question is whether this @entity8 is the right time to bed @entity51 in to the one - day side or whether should @entity17 add more dynamism into the top order in the form of @entity55 , who is deserving of his chance now more than ever			2
@entity109 , dumped on the eve of the first game but impressive in practice here , will also return to @entity17 ’s thoughts			2
@entity17 , with one victory in their first three @entity116 games , are pretty much where everyone expected them to be at this stage but the scale of their defeats by @entity92 and @entity121 raised more questions over @entity21			1
@entity21 was always likely to find himself under the spotlight in his second coming as coach but privately it is said that the players like and respect him and that he gets his message across to them , however unconvincing he is in public			1
his new one - day captain offered his support			0
‘ @entity133 has been completely different to @entity134 , @entity135 or anyone else i have worked with before , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ he brings a lot of energy to the side and a lot of ideas			2
‘ the basis of international cricket is trying to be one step ahead of the game , particularly as a coach , and he has been good in trying to find those little edges without taking away the basics since he ’s been involved			0
’ the anthem issue is a contentious one because it throws up the whole dynamic of national identity , which is more complicated in cricket than most sports			2
@entity0 is not the first nor the last international sportsman who has chosen not to sing ( @entity156 was the only player to sing @entity158 the @entity157 before the match against @entity160 ) but it has been noted in @entity0 ’s case because is a @entity162 now at the helm of the @entity17 side			1
@entity165 ( left ) and @entity166 ( right ) enjoy a game of touch rugby ahead of @entity17 's next match @entity17 coach @entity21 gives instructions during training in @entity43 @entity21 talks with bowler @entity172 during an @entity17 nets session at @entity12 ‘ it ’s pretty simple , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i have never sung the @entity26 whether i ’ve been playing for @entity175 or @entity17			1
it does n’t make me any less proud to be an @entity178 cricketer			0
‘ i am extremely proud to be in the position i ’m in and privileged to be captain of a @entity8 side			0
it ’s a long story but it ’s a personal thing			0
’ @entity0 chose not to tell that long story which is a shame because it leaves him open to conjecture as to why he will not exercise his vocal cords			2
but the bottom line is that it is his choice and it is better surely to be true to yourself rather than , as some dual nationals in @entity17 ’s recent history have , belted out the anthem for effect			1
@entity191 talks with team - mate @entity172 during an @entity17 nets session at @entity12 @entity172 passes the ball in a game of touch rugby during an @entity17 nets session there are plenty who would not care if @entity0 hummed the @entity200 under his breath while the anthem was being played as long as he scores runs and leads @entity17 to a victory over @entity48 that would all but guarantee their quarter - final place			1
it will not be easy			0
@entity48 defeated @entity17 in all forms last summer and then comfortably overcame them again in that one - day series before @entity89			0
and only on thursday they demolished @entity209 with @entity210 smashing 161 and @entity211 scoring a century in his 400th one - day international			0
@entity17 hope the swing here at the @entity214 with which @entity215 destroyed them against @entity121 can now work to their advantage			0
‘ @entity48 are in a good place at the moment , ’ added @entity0			0
‘ it ’s a test for us coming up again against their best cricketers , guys who have played 300 , 400 games			0
we have done a lot of work on the possibility of the ball swinging throughout the first innings , as it did last time			0
we ’ll be more than happy for the ball to swing around again now .			0
