if you 've always been plagued by a jittery grip when applying eye makeup , stick - on eyeliner could well be the big beauty trend you 've been waiting for			2
the innovative make - up creation first premiered at @entity7 ’s couture show in july , where it was reported by @entity10 that the brand ’s make - up artist and creative director @entity13 hand - cut 70 pairs of metallic slivers to create a ' highly contrasting and artificial ' look			1
but now the trend has made its way onto the shelves , thanks to brands such as @entity7 , @entity22 and @entity23 , all of whom currently offer a different version of the unusual accessory			1
silver mystery : stick - on eyeliner tattoos made a splash at a @entity7 couture show in july , and are now available in a limited edition from the makeup company as well as others a clean look : the silver design debuted by @entity7 has been hailed as futuristic , but the eyelids have to be free of oils or other makeup before applying unsurprisingly , @entity7 ’s take on the trend does n’t come cheap , with four pairs of stickers costing a whopping $ 61			1
@entity22 ’s @entity44 are much more affordable , at just $ 25 for three pairs , while @entity23 charges $ 6 per pair			1
designs feature a variety of colors and textures , including black or metallic , glossy or glittery and even velour			0
while some reviewers admitted that the stick - on liners were tricky to master on the first attempt , many have raved about the temporary eyelid tattoos , praising their versatility and , in the case of the black ones , convincing looks			0
indeed , the only issue with the stickers seems to be that they usually have to be used alone , because other eye products can prevent them from sticking to your lids			1
but once they 're in place , they 'll stick around			0
no big commitment : more budget - friendly versions are also available , and are no more uncomfortable than a pair of false lashes @entity79 's tester almost gave up on her @entity81 stickers , but , she wrote : ' once i wiped my lids clean , the appliqués stuck , and they stayed in place until i peeled them off before going to bed			2
' she added : ' people at the office kept asking me how i was able to draw such perfect lines ! ' though other styles can get expensive , they are also reusable , with @entity22 's @entity44 being capable of making the rounds three times before losing its glue , a @entity94 reviewer found			2
it also offers you three different shapes in one package , with upward and downward flicks for the more adventurous			0
@entity106 : the eyeliner stickers are often reusable and can be stuck on the lower or upper lids , or even around the eyebrows @entity7 's limited - edition @entity110 , styled after the couture show versions , are also reusable and come with extra adhesive			1
all the reviewers found their stick - ons comfortable , comparing them to false lashes that you can feel less and less over time			0
ironically , they look best with a little help from the real thing : @entity122 makeup expert @entity121			0
advised @entity79 readers to ' place stickers as close to lash lines as possible , and use liquid liner to fill in gaps			0
