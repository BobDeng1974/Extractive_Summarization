@entity0 accused @entity2 manager @entity1 of throwing in the towel by selecting a weakened team against @entity5			1
@entity1 flew in the face of convention by taking out big names like @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 for @entity2 ’s biggest @entity13 assignment since 2009			1
though they defended stoically , the @entity15 team were beaten 1 - 0 in the @entity16 by @entity18 ’s first - half goal and rarely troubled @entity5 goalkeeper @entity19			1
@entity1 stands stony - faced on the touchline at the @entity16 during @entity2 's defeat the @entity2 manager takes notes during the match ( was he writing down his starting line - up for @entity26 ? ) @entity1 roars out orders to his depleted side from his technical area at the @entity16 @entity1 looks to the heavens during a defeat which was not as bad as it could have been @entity0 launched a spectacular @entity33 attack on @entity1 for selecting a weakened line - up @entity9 ( left ) , @entity35 ( centre ) and @entity37 watch on from the bench in @entity5 the changes , which come ahead of @entity26 ’s visit to @entity41 in the @entity15 on saturday , prompted @entity0 to criticise @entity1 on @entity33 and describe his selection as ‘ unbefitting of a club of @entity2 ’s stature ’			1
@entity0 tweeted : ‘ @entity1 has left out @entity37 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity9 and @entity45 at @entity5			1
he has , though , thrown in a white towel			0
‘ selecting a weakened side in @entity49 ’s premier competition , especially against @entity5 , is unbefitting of a club of @entity2 ’s stature			1
‘ if i were one of @entity2 ’s star players , i ’d be choked to be left out of a game at the @entity16 against the @entity13 champions			1
’ @entity0 claimed he would be choked at being left out of such a huge @entity13 fixture at the @entity16 @entity0 later joked that @entity2 manager @entity1 had thrown in the white towel in @entity0 tweeted during half time of the @entity5 game to have another pop at @entity2 's team selection @entity2 attempt to tackle goalscorer @entity18 during the @entity60 ' 1 - 0 defeat to @entity5 on tuesday @entity0 did backrack slightly after the game by giving @entity1 the benefit of the doubt over his selection @entity1 , however , insisted he had nothing to apologise for and hit back , saying @entity66 lacked the know - how to appreciate why he made the decisions			1
@entity1 said : ‘ @entity0 is a figure i respect and he was a top player but he has never been a manager , so probably does n’t truly understand what you are up against in terms of planning forward that way			2
‘ we were certainly far from throwing it away			0
you know , @entity76 has scored in every game since the @entity79 final			2
that shows you how hard we defended and how hard we worked			0
right to the very end i think my players put in a performance that showed their passion , their commitment and their quality			0
that would be my answer			0
i am not bothered about the criticism			0
’ @entity91 ( second left ) looks dejected as @entity5 's players congratulate @entity18 after his opener @entity18 runs to the delighted home supporters after scoring the first goal of the night in the @entity16 @entity96 , formerly of @entity2 , challenges opposing midfielder @entity97 in the opening stages @entity0 later backtracked slightly , tweeting : ‘ @entity1 intimating that many of his players were dropped for being awful at @entity101 rather than being rested			1
if that ’s true , fair enough			0
’ however , he was not alone in questioning @entity1			2
@entity103 expressed sympathy for @entity9 , who came on in the 70th minute to a standing ovation			0
@entity103 said on @entity106 : ‘ i think @entity9 is capable of playing in this game and on saturday ( against @entity26 )			2
it is tuesday night , he ’ll have two days ’ recovery , train friday , play saturday and he ’s got a nice little two weeks off			0
i think that ’s probably why he gave up international football , to play in games like this			0
i do n’t think he ’ll be happy			0
’ @entity18 ( right ) hurdles as he is denied by a combination of @entity91 ( on ground ) and @entity118 the view from behind the goal as @entity91 stretches and acrobatically denies @entity76 ( left ) another @entity106 pundit , @entity121 , added : ‘ that team for me says he is prioritising the weekend game against @entity26			1
he is saying if we win our last two @entity126 games we will probably qualify but it is risky			0
’ @entity1 accepted @entity2 have their work cut out to get out of @entity129 they need to win their final two games , at @entity131 and home to @entity133			2
@entity134 posted an amusing tweet in reaction to @entity118 's elevation to the starting line - up @entity139 was another to take issue with @entity2 's starting line - up to take on @entity5 @entity143 reporter vented his frustration with @entity1 selection decision on his @entity33 page @entity147 poked fun at @entity118 with this tweet of @entity5 players @entity151 ( left ) and @entity76 @entity152 posted this amusing tweet of a ' supposed ' @entity2 fan learning of @entity2 's line - up video we did n't need to play with intensity - @entity157			1
