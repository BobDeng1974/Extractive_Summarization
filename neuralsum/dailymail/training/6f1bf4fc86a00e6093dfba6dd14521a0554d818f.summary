@entity0 admitted that this @entity2 side will have to make significant improvements if they are to challenge at the top of the table despite a morale - boosting 2 - 1 victory at @entity8 which lifted them into the top four			1
the @entity2 manager hailed his make - shift team , which included a back three of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , but said that the opening 25 minutes , in which @entity2 looked as though they would be swept aside by @entity8 , was an indication of how much ground they had to make up			1
@entity2 secured the victory secured through a @entity23 own goal and a @entity25 strike , but van @entity0 said : ‘ i was not pleased with the way we had played in the first half so i do n’t think it ’s my best victory with @entity2			1
of course , it ’s an away game against a top team and we have won			2
@entity8 created a lot of chances but fortunately we have a very good goalkeeper in @entity48 and after the first 25 minutes you saw we were coming back in the game			1
‘ that ’s what i said at half time : when we keep the ball , when we show confidence then we shall create many , many chances			2
and we created at last three big chances			0
and twice the pass was easy to give to @entity59 and @entity25 and the passes , which were not difficult , were not right			0
and we have to improve that			0
’ @entity2 keeper @entity48 was man of the match , keeping @entity2 in the game at times but even he was urged to improve by @entity0			1
‘ his quality is on the goal - line but he has to improve also in their aspects of the game			1
when i say that you think that i ’m crazy but i ’m not crazy , believe me			0
‘ and if @entity8 had score in the first 20 minutes , it would have been another game and then maybe i would have had to respond to all the questions because i had chosen three defenders – but now i can laugh			2
‘ i was convinced before the match i had made the right decision – but making the decision before the match is a quality decision , i can say that now			0
but i ca n’t do anything else as i do n’t have so many players			0
i think the players have done fantastically and @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity83 – how old are they ? and they play against a top team like @entity8 , who are always changing position			2
but i was not pleased			0

@entity2 *enjoyed* a morale - boosting 2 - 1 win at @entity8
@entity0 says he was not impressed with the first - half *performance*
the @entity2 manager thinks @entity48 still has to improve
@entity95 admits that if @entity8 had scored in the first half , it would have been a completely different game
