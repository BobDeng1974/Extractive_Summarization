the primary air traffic control system around @entity1 shut down last week because data from the a u- 2 spy plane 's flight plan confused software that helps track and route aircraft around the region , the @entity2 said monday			1
when the system failed wednesday , a backup helped safely guide flights already in the air , but hundreds of planes across the nation headed for @entity16 were ordered not to take off as an air traffic control facility about 40 miles north of @entity1 effectively rebooted			1
the problem had nothing to do with spy - related signals sent by the @entity22 - era plane			0
hidden disruption : a @entity22 - era @entity24 air force u- 2 spy plane forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights at and around @entity1 on wednesday afternoon the plane flies at around 60,000 feet under ' visual flight rules			1
' according to the @entity2 , a computer perceived a conflict between the altitude and the use of visual flight rules , and began trying to route the plane to 10,000 feet			0
the number of adjustments that would need to be made to routes of other planes throughout the area overwhelmed the software			0
' the extensive number of routings that would have been required to deconflict the aircraft with lower - altitude flights used a large amount of available memory and interrupted the computer 's other flight - processing functions , ' the @entity2 said in a statement			0
the @entity51 confirmed monday that an air force u- 2 spy plane was conducting training operations in the area			1
it is not unusual for a u- 2 to operate in the region , and the necessary flight plan had been submitted for the high - flying plane , col. @entity55 said			1
going nowhere : hundreds of flights were either cancelled or diverted from @entity1 , one of the countries biggest airports			2
the @entity2 announced on monday that it was the high - flying plane 's complex flight plan that overloaded flight tracking systems , not ' spy signals ' the connection between the u- 2 and the outage was first reported by @entity72			1
since the incident , the @entity2 has been analyzing what went wrong with its @entity76 system			0
the computer system , known as @entity76 , allows air traffic controllers at several dozen ' en route centers ' around the country to identify and direct planes at high altitudes			2
the @entity1 en route center controls high altitude air traffic over southern and central @entity16 , southern @entity88 , southwestern @entity87 and western @entity86 - except airspace designated for military use			2
in its statement , the @entity2 said it has adjusted @entity76 to require altitude details for flight plans			0
' the @entity2 is confident these steps will prevent a reoccurrence of this specific problem and other potential similar issues going forward , ' the agency said			0
when the system failed , air traffic controllers in @entity16 had to call their counterparts at neighboring centers to update them on each plane 's flight plan , according to @entity105 , the president for @entity106 of the @entity107			2
while that was more onerous than normal operations - when computers automatically pass along updates - the system still worked , @entity105 said			0
time to upgrade ? computer software at the @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity16 ( pictured ) was unable to distinguish between commercial aircraft and the spy plane which was flying miles above			1

*glitch* occurred on wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m.
despite u- 2 spy plane flying at 60,000 feet , air traffic control software was unable to distinguish it from commercial aircraft
the problem at the @entity127 meant planes bound for the region were also *grounded*
200 flights at @entity1 alone were either cancelled or diverted
other airports across the southwest were also *affected*
