a late afternoon ocean swim for a mother and her children turned into a complete nightmare which almost cost her young son his life			1
@entity7 and her two children @entity6 , 9 , and @entity9 , 6 , were enjoying the ' warm bath water ' at @entity12 beach , @entity13 , at about 4pm on @entity14			1
but it was n't long before @entity7 realised she had been stung by a creature and when @entity9 came towards her in the knee - deep water he began to scream in pain			1
paramedics revived the young boy on the way to the hospital after he lost consciousness , the @entity20 reported			0
@entity7 and her son , @entity9 , thought they were going to die after being stung by a rare jellyfish @entity9 , 6 , with his burn scars from the irukandji morbakka fenneri that he encountered in the water ' i took off my reef shoes and pulled the tentacles off my feet , ' @entity7 told @entity35			1
' the tentacle that was wrapped around my shoe was about 50cm long in total			0
' she said her son must have walked straight into the creature as he was only about a metre away from her as he walked towards his mother after she was stung			1
' then i asked people nearby to take care of @entity9 and make sure he was ok because i was having problems breathing and i had pains in my chest , ' she said			1
@entity7 was convinced that she was having a heart attack as the unbearable pain spread to her lower back , legs and arms			2
' i thought i was dying and my son said he thought he was dying too , ' she said			2
' the first ambulance took my son who was vomiting , frothing at the mouth and his lips had turned blue			1
' @entity9 needed three shots of adrenalin and one shot of morphine before being monitored in hospital for the night			1
while @entity7 received two shots of morphine for the excruciating pain to begin to subside			1
' @entity9 is a very healthy and fit kid but if it was someone half his size - it would have been a very different situation , ' his mother said			2
' initially we were terribly worried as he is quite a talented pianist and cellist , however , he will make a full recovery			0
' @entity9 with a small part of a tentacle of the creature that almost killed him on @entity14 more evidence of the highly - potent jellyfish that caused him to vomit , froth at the mouth as his lips turned blue @entity82 national medical adviser professor @entity81 and world marine stinger expert @entity79 were sent a sample of the creature 's tentacles and identified it as an irukandji morbakka fenneri , which is coincidentally the species @entity79 discovered in @entity89 and named in 2008			1
' the specimen that stung @entity9 was unusual and the second most potent i 've ever seen , ' dr @entity79 told the @entity20			2
this incident follows , dr @entity79 's warning back in august that the dangerous creatures were around @entity96 beach on the @entity97 and that the numbers would increase as the earth warmed			0
dr @entity79 said the @entity101 species was responsible for a diver being put on life supports off @entity104 in 2000			0
' in this case the woman saw the critter whack into her while she was diving , and then the specimen was captured by her dive buddy so the @entity110 was pretty reliable , ' she told the @entity111			0
a lifelong @entity12 resident who has swum at the beach since she was child , @entity7 wanted to share her story to warn others about the dangers of the beach as she had never heard of this specific creature ever sighted in the area			2
