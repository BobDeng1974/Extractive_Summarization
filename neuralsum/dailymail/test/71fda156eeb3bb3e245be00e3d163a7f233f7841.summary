red squirrels have returned to one of @entity3 's most stunning beauty spots after a 16 - year absence red squirrels have returned to one of @entity3 's most stunning beauty spots after a 16 - year absence			1
native reds have been almost wiped out in the country , except for a few pockets in the north of @entity13 , the @entity14 and @entity15 after rival grey squirrels arrived from @entity17 in the 19th century			2
numbers of the reds , popularly illustrated in the @entity21 books , have been rapidly dwindling thanks in large part to the squirrel pox virus carried by greys			1
but now , red squirrels have been spotted in @entity27 , in the picturesque @entity28			1
experts say a lack of habitats caused them to disappear from the area			1
since 1952 , 95 % of red squirrels have been wiped out in @entity13 and @entity34			1
but @entity35 , of charity @entity36 , said they are returning to woods in the area - and some have even been spotted in the town centre			1
he said : ' so far this year there have been seven sightings , including just a few weeks ago a red seen bouncing around in @entity45 right in the centre of @entity27			1
' it is pretty clear that they are here in good numbers			0
' @entity51 , habitat loss and competition for food from non-native grey squirrels have been blamed for the decline in reds			0
recent @entity3 studies of 300 woodlands have also shown red squirrels are battling against the greys with numbers rising steadily			1
meanwhile @entity75 , @entity76 , is now a grey squirrel - free zone , wildlife experts claim after a controversial 20 - year eradication programme on the island			0
@entity81 squirrels have been blamed for carrying diseases which have endangered the population of red squirrels			1
more than 700 red squirrels are now thought to live on @entity75 , with many crossing the @entity86 to settle in @entity87			1
in 2013 , academics found a red nicknamed ' @entity89 ' , after @entity91 's alter ego , who was stricken with the deadly ' parapox virus ' and managed to fight it off and live			0
the research , carried out by the @entity96 , was heralded as a major breakthrough as it proved that reds can build immunity			0
@entity100 , @entity101 field officer at the @entity102 for @entity103 and @entity104 , said : ' it could be a few years down the line until we know for sure if red squirrels have any long - term immunity or not , as there is much more research that needs to be done			1
experts say a lack of habitats caused them to disappear from the area			1
pictured : view of @entity27 ' but this squirrel survived the pox , which is great news			2
' we named him @entity89 , after @entity91 's ' @entity89 ' , because he 's a super squirrel			0
we do n't know why he survived , but something made him resistant to the pox			0
' we radio - tracked him after his release so we could check on his progress back in the wild and he did well			0
' the species was almost wiped out at the @entity128 when there was a squirrel pox virus outbreak in 2008 and the population declined by over 80 per cent			0
numbers are now increasing with red squirrel sightings reported across the region			1
red squirrels have been almost wiped out , except for a few pockets in the north of @entity13 , the @entity14 and @entity15			2
file photo the red squirrel has been a native of @entity3 for several thousand years , but the first grey squirrels were brought here from @entity17 in 1876			2
over the years , more were introduced , notably by the @entity143 to the park at @entity145 where they thrived			0
but contrary to popular belief that greys are ' driving out ' the reds , experts believe it is because the greys being more adaptable to our ecosystem			0
a major factor is the ability to survive tough winters due to the fact that greys generally carry more body fat - and a full - grown grey can weigh almost twice as much as a red			0
@entity81 squirrels are also more adventurous and happier foraging on the ground , whereas red squirrels spend most of their lives high up in conifer trees and their diet is less varied			2
greys became known as ' vermin ' in the 1920s and 1930s when their large numbers started to cause significant damage to commercial forestry and beech trees			0
a law was passed in 1938 banning further importation of these creatures , and in following years various methods were tried without success to control grey squirrels			0
this coincided with low red squirrel numbers after the red population was decimated between 1900 and 1920 by the parapox virus , similar to myxomatosis in rabbits .			2

numbers of native red squirrels have been rapidly dwindling in the country
now , several sightings have been reported in @entity27 , @entity28
experts say a lack of habitats caused them to disappear from the area
but they are now returning to woods in the area and some have even been spotted in the town centre
