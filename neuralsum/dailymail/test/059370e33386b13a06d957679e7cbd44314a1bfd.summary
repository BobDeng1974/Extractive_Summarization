the tv channel @entity0 will shut down for 12 hours on the day of the general election to encourage more youngsters to vote			1
cult @entity4 sitcoms like @entity5 and @entity6 will be taken off air for 12 hours – with viewers tuning in on 7 may shown instead an advert telling people to go to the polls			1
the specially - produced advert will be played , featuring ' @entity13 ' – the man fictionally in charge of keeping @entity0 on air , sitting in the channel 's control room			1
@entity0 is the most popular channel for younger viewers , reaching 8.7 million 16 - 34 year olds every month – ahead of @entity30 and @entity31			1
its regular schedule will be suspended from 7am , when polls open , to 7pm , three hours before polling closes , when the channel will return to normal with @entity36			0
@entity38 , @entity39 's chief marketing officer said : ' less than half of under - 25s voted at the last election so we 've engaged the most powerful weapon that we have at our disposal to try and boost that number - switching off their favourite tv channel for the day			2
' @entity0 's sister station @entity39 will also run a special advertising campaign encouraging youngsters to vote			2
voters aged between 18 - 24 and 25 - 34 are by far the least likely to take part in elections , prompting fears that politicians have given up trying to appeal to their concerns the adverts will ask viewers : ' how many times have you missed life - changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show ? ' may 7 is election day and @entity13 is going to turn @entity0 off so you might as well go and vote			1
you wo n't forget will you darren ? ' but viewers will only be able to take advantage of the tv switch - off if they have already registered to vote – with the deadline having already passed			0
meanwhile , @entity39 will present an ' alternative ' to the election night coverage on the @entity30 and @entity73 , with a programme co-anchored by @entity75 and comedian @entity76			0
@entity75 , who left @entity30 's @entity77 last june , said : ' elections matter			0
but that does n't mean the coverage has to be dull			0
i hope there 'll be room for both insight and laughter			0
' the election - day shut down on @entity0 will see programmes including ' @entity6 ' ( pictured ) taken off air for 12 hours fans of the @entity4 sitcom @entity5 will also be hit by the @entity0 decision to switch off its coverage between 7am and 7pm @entity76 added : ' our aim is to keep people watching much later than they intended and we will be judged by the dip in the nation 's productivity on friday 8 may			1
' the show will also include special election - themed episodes of @entity102 and @entity103			2
the @entity30 's coverage of the election will be anchored by @entity106 , while @entity107 presides over @entity73 's election show and @entity109 anchors @entity111 's coverage .			0

cult @entity4 shows like @entity5 will be axed for 12 hours on may 7
instead , @entity0 will show a special advert encouraging people to vote
the radical move could have a significant impact on the election
@entity0 is the most popular channel for 16 - 34 year olds , watched by 8.7 million
