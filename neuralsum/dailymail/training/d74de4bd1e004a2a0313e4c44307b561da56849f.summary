by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 29 october 2013 the precise moment two of the most powerful and destructive volcanoes in @entity3 erupted and began spewing lava and ash hundreds of feet into the air have been caught on camera			1
@entity9 volcanic photographer dr @entity8 stayed awake for up to 20 hours straight in a bid to capture the shots of the @entity13 and @entity14 volcanoes in the @entity16 region			1
@entity13 and @entity14 are among 150 volcanoes situated in the region and are classed as stratovolcanoes because of their giant height ; with their summits reaching 10,771ft and 15,862ft respectively			1
@entity9 volcanic photographer dr @entity8 stayed awake for 20 hours to capture the spewing lava and eruptions from both the @entity13 and @entity14 volcanoes in the @entity32 region @entity8 travelled thousands of miles from his home in @entity35 , @entity36 , to the @entity37 of @entity3 , to take the shots			1
at @entity13 , he plotted just 3.5 miles away in an area previously destroyed by a previous eruption			0
while picturing @entity41 , the closest @entity42 could safely get was 12.5 miles away			0
dr @entity8 , a molecular biologist , said : ' at @entity13 we camped in an area that had no trees left thanks to a previous eruption			1
it meant we were able to get much better pictures with nothing in the way			0
' but the trouble with a lava dome is these things are unstable - it could look benign but them suddenly collapse			0
if that had happened we would have been gone			0
' that 's why we always travel in groups to these events so that there is support if you need help			0
' dr @entity8 , who says his extreme hobby can sometimes leave his family concerned , has spent the last 10 years travelling the globe in search of photographing and picturing eruptions , also known as ' volcano hunting			1
' @entity72 eruption from the summit of the @entity13 lava dome			2
@entity13 is a stratovolcano - one of @entity16 's largest volcanoes - with a summit of 10,771 feet			1
@entity13 increased activity in may 2009 and has been periodically spewing ash up to distances of six miles ever since the eruption of the @entity14 volcano is shown reflected in the @entity82			1
the first @entity14 eruption was recorded in 1697 and it has been almost continuously active ever since			2
the volcano was first climbed in 1788			0
several climbers were killed by flying lava when they attempted the ascent in 1931 this image shows the destruction caused by the @entity13 on the surrounding areas			2
dead trees sit on the embankment of an erosion gully			0
so - called pyroclastic flow , or the flow of hot gas and rocks , from the eruption would have caused this trench to develop in the landscape			0
it sits approximately six miles from the @entity13 lava dome these latest photos , captured earlier this month , show lava spewing out from the two stratovolcanoes before trickling down the rocky sides			1
huge clouds of ash can then be seen developing above the active volcanoes			2
@entity13 was most recently active between 11 october and 16 october , while @entity110 was last active between 16 october and 22 october			2
dr @entity8 said the key to his success was to capitalise on small windows of good weather : ' it is very difficult to get close and conditions can often be poor - snow and gale force winds are common			1
we had only small windows when the clouds cleared to capture the photographs			0
' volcanoes are quite volatile things so you have to make the most of a clear skies before it changes again			0
' @entity16 sits at a similar latitude to the @entity9 but arctic winds from @entity131 along with the @entity133 sea current mean the peninsula is covered in snow from october to late may			2
dr @entity8 uses a @entity137 digital slr and lenses with a wide opening to allow as much light in as possible			1
@entity141 flows from the dome of the @entity3 @entity13 volcano			1
@entity13 was most recently active between october 11 and october 16			0
it has had over 60 large explosive eruptions during the past 10,000 years			0
slowly rising lava domes may grow for months or for several years following explosive eruptions dr @entity8 is shown in front of the @entity14 volcano to west of the @entity150 in @entity3			1
dr @entity8 has been chasing volcano eruptions for 10 years and uses a @entity137 digital slr alongside lenses with a wide opening to allow as much light in as possible			1
he camped 12.5 miles away from the volcano 's dome in an area previously destroyed by lava there are more than 150 volcanoes on @entity16 and up to 30 of them are active			1
@entity13 has had over 60 large eruptions during the past 10,000 years and in 1956 , a large part of the lava dome collapsed and created a debris avalanche			2
the volcanoes of @entity16 are a large group of volcanoes situated on the @entity16 which is above the @entity82 and the surrounding valley			0
the highest volcano is the @entity14 , or @entity14 , which is also the largest active volcano in the @entity171			2
the first eruption of the @entity14 was recorded in 1697 , and it has been almost continuously active ever since			2
@entity72 cloud is seen rising from the @entity14 volcano - the highest mountain on the @entity16 and the highest active volcano in @entity177			1
as the lava flow travels down from the stratovolcano 's dome it melts the snow and glaciers below			0
this creates a cloud of steam that rises from end of the flow this image shows the glowing rockfall from the @entity13 in the background , and an erosion gully created by previous eruptions in the foreground			0
in 2007 , the ash cloud caused by an eruption from this volcano soared 32,000 feet in to the air			0

shots show eruptions from the @entity13 and @entity14 volcanoes found on the @entity3 @entity16 peninsula
molecular biologist dr @entity8 stayed awake for up to 20 hours to capture images of spewing lava
the 10,771 feet @entity13 volcano erupted in 2009 and has been periodically spewing ash ever since
@entity14 first erupted in 1697 and several *people* have been killed by falling lava when attempting to climb it
there are more than 150 volcanoes on the @entity16 in the @entity37 of @entity3 and up to 30 are active
