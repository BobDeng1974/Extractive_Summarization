@entity0 faced a second by - election blow last night after a new survey suggested @entity5 ’s latest @entity4 mp defector @entity3 is on course for victory in @entity8			1
a @entity10 poll for @entity11 shows that mr @entity3 is nine points ahead of the @entity13 , and that @entity15 ’s fans are not put off by the prime minister ’s warning that voting @entity5 will result in @entity18 winning power			1
the result is a slap in the face for @entity4 chairman @entity23 , who called mr @entity3 a ‘ liar ’ for breaking his promise to constituents not to defect			2
the poll is the first in @entity8 , @entity37 , since mr reckless ’ defection , and was carried out after mr @entity0 ’s tax giveaway pledge , suggesting areas where @entity5 is strong are yet to be won over			2
when mr @entity3 announced he would call a by - election , conservative chiefs were confident they would win			1
they believed maverick mr @entity3 lacked the credibility and popularity of fellow @entity4 mp defector @entity46 , who is expected to retain his @entity49 seat in thursday ’s by - election in the @entity52 seaside town by a big margin			1
but the @entity10 poll shows mr @entity0 faces an uphill battle in defeating mr @entity3 next month			1
mr @entity57 ’ nine - point lead is far less than mr @entity46 ’s massive 44 - point lead in a @entity10 poll last month , but it means he is the early favourite to be @entity5 ’s second mp			2
today ’s survey shows mr @entity3 on 40 , with the @entity13 on 31 – 18 down on their performance at the 2010 election in @entity8 – @entity31 25 and the @entity65 a paltry two			1
unlike mr @entity46 , mr @entity3 is no pin - up in his constituency			1
only 25 per cent of conservative voters say @entity57 is a hero for defecting , half mr @entity46 ’s rating in @entity49			2
and 31 per cent say he is a ‘ traitor			0
’ only 12 per cent said they will vote @entity5 because they like @entity57 : @entity46 ’s personal vote was nearly three times higher			2
the new poll shows that @entity15 fans are not put off by @entity0 's warning that voting @entity5 will result in @entity18 winning power but they are sympathetic to mr @entity3 , who admitted he was once too drunk to vote in the @entity81			1
a total of 48 per cent say it does not make him unfit to be an mp			0
@entity5 ’s popularity in @entity8 is not driven by hatred of @entity85 : local voters are only marginally in favour of leaving the @entity88 by 41 per cent to 37			2
the poll also suggests that if he wins , @entity57 could hold on to the seat at the @entity91			0
nearly nine out of ten @entity5 voters said they would vote for him again next year			0
mr @entity0 ’s vivid warning that on polling day next year voters may ‘ go to bed with @entity15 and wake up with @entity18 ’ appears to have been rejected			0
a total of 21 per cent @entity5 supporters said it made them less likely to vote @entity5 ; 23 per cent said they were more likely to do so			0
@entity99 said it would have no effect			0
however , @entity4 voters said by a ratio of 39 points to one that it would deter them from backing @entity15			0
@entity10 chief executive @entity106 said : ‘ if this snapshot of opinion in @entity8 and @entity109 reflects the by - election outcome , the @entity4 will be worried			1
this seat is regarded as 271st in a list of the 650 parliamentary constituencies most likely to produce a @entity5 victory			0
‘ if @entity3 is elected despite the @entity4 throwing the kitchen sink at the by - election campaign , other conservative mps may conclude it is safer for their political careers to defect to @entity5 rather than stand and fight @entity15 ’s insurgency			1
’ mr @entity15 with @entity121 , @entity5 's new £ 1million donor , who switched to the party during the @entity4 conference @entity15 ’s new £ 1 million donor pays a corporation tax rate of just 0.008 per cent on a multi-million pound insurance business , it can be revealed			1
@entity121 , a former @entity4 supporter who switched to @entity5 during the @entity4 , has paid the @entity129 just £ 9,000 in corporation tax over the past five years from @entity131 – despite making gross profits of nearly £ 117 million over the same period			0
last night mr @entity121 , who is worth £ 100 million and has a controlling interest in a @entity135 diamond mine , told @entity11 that the low corporate tax bill was the legitimate result of ‘ offsetting administrative expenses against profits ’			0
he said : ‘ stick your offshore tax story where the sun do n’t shine ’ , before adding : ‘ up the revolution ! ’			0

poll shows that @entity5 defector @entity3 is nine points ahead of @entity13
suggests that mr @entity3 is on course for by - election victory in @entity8
mr @entity3 defected to @entity5 ahead of the @entity4 conference
comes as fellow defector @entity46 looks set to retain his seat in @entity49 by - election
