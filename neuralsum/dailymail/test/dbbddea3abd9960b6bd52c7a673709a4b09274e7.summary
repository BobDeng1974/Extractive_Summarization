a morbidly obese man has started documenting his efforts to lose more than 300lbs - without weight loss surgery - after the intense back pain brought on by his size prompted him to get serious about his health			1
for years , @entity7 - based writer @entity6 , ignored that at 563lbs he was severely overweight - even shrugging off strangers who called him ' fatty ' as he walked down the street			1
but after a series of health issues , the 39 - year - old became inspired to shed more than half of his body weight the natural way and chronicle his journey for the @entity17			1
' i know i 'm responsible for my actions , ' the columnist wrote for the newspaper 's website			0
' and i 'm the only person who can really fix the problem			0
weight loss journey : @entity6 , 39 , of @entity7 , is sharing his efforts to lose over 300lbs ; he started out weighing 563lbs and has lost 20lbs in a month @entity6 shared that he has been overweight since high school , and over the years has gotten used to the fact that he does n't fit into seats at most public venues or booths at restaurants			1
as one of 79 million obese @entity35 , he has also become accustomed to the emotional pain of being called ' fatty ' and getting verbally abused by strangers			0
in fact , even a diagnosis of @entity42 diabetes did n't alarm him enough to change his habits , and other health issues , like regularly pulling muscles in his calves , became a way of life			0
it was n't until a combination of intense lower back pain - caused by carrying groceries , since @entity6 said he ca n't carry anything that weighs much more than a magazine - and trouble sleeping led him to see a doctor			1
' the pain had reached a point where i was practically immobile , ' he said , adding that he could walk only 150 feet before he would have to stop			0
that 's when an x-ray showed him that he also had arthritis and a narrowing of his spinal cavity			1
his doctor referred him to the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity7			2
now , @entity6 is working with a therapist to tackle his emotional eating issues , as well as a nutritionist and a physical therapist			2
he also uses a calorie - counting app on his phone to track his eating , but admitted that even though he is serious about losing weight , making major lifestyle changes is n't easy			0
' i do n't know if i want to go through the rest of my life eating a leaf of kale and two scoops of vitamin supplements and sipping a thimble of water , ' he said			0
' the thought terrifies me of no more pizza , nachos , chicken wings , @entity90 or fries			0
' but he is still determined to try to lose over 300lbs the old - fashioned way , rather than go under the knife			0
if he chose to have gastric sleeve surgery , which makes the stomach smaller and reduces the hormones that produce cravings , he could lose as much as 60 per cent of his excess weight in a year - but @entity6 said he is afraid of such a drastic medical procedure , and his doctor has told him that it should only be considered as a last resort			1
working hard : @entity6 is working with a mental health therapist , a physical therapist , and a nutritionist to lose weight and recover from myriad health problems ' it took me a long time to gain the weight			1
it will take time to lose it , ' said @entity6 , adding that his goal is to move slowly and lose ' maybe 50 or 52lbs a year '			1
focusing more on changing his lifestyle than dieting could be the key to long - lasting success for the writer , as a study by the @entity121 and @entity122 found that more than 95 per cent of diets fail			2
so far , his efforts are paying off : after three weeks working toward his goal , he said that for the first time in years he felt better about his health			0
now a month in , he has lost 20.6lbs , which he noted is equal to the weight of ' four fully grown chihuahuas ' or ' a tire for a full - sized sedan ' .			2

@entity7 - based writer @entity6 , 39 , weighed 563lbs when he started sharing his weight loss journey a month *ago* in the @entity17
he knew it was time to shape up after x-rays found arthritis and a narrowing of his spinal cavity
@entity6 , who is already down 20lbs , is attempting to lose the weight without surgery but is terrified to give up pizza and nachos
