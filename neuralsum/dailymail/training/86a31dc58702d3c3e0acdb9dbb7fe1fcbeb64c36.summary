a model which has foretold the correct results of the @entity3 selections in @entity5 presidential elections since 1980 , has predicted a loss for @entity7 and the @entity8			1
the forecast was made by two professors at the @entity11 who used economic data and unemployment figures from each state to predict a @entity16 win come november			1
political science professors @entity18 and @entity20 ’s study predicts 218 electoral votes for president @entity7 and 320 for @entity22 with the @entity16 candidate winning every seat currently considered to be on the fence			1
@entity7 loss , @entity22 win : the forecast model predicted disappointing results for president @entity7 with 218 seats to @entity22 's 320 with @entity22 taking home the crown in all current swing states the prediction model uses economic data from all 50 states and the @entity37 , including income per capita and both state and national unemployment figures			1
the research concluded that @entity5 voters blame @entity8 for high unemployment rates but hold @entity16 more responsible for low per capita income			0
it also showed that the advantage of holding the @entity47 disappears for @entity8 candidates when the national unemployment rate hits 5.6 per cent			0
' based on our forecasting model , it becomes clear that the president is in electoral trouble , ' professor @entity18 said			0
winning ? @entity22 , photographed on thursday from his campaign plane in @entity56 , @entity57 , has been picked to win by @entity3 prediction model , but a new poll argues the contrary favourite ? a new @entity63 / @entity62 poll says that most @entity5 believe president @entity7 , pictured on wednesday in @entity64 , will win in november the professors ’ analysis concluded that @entity22 would take home all swing states including @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity77 voted for @entity7 in 2008 but the current president is predicted a marginal loss at 48.1 per cent against @entity22 ’s 51.9 per cent , although with the caveat that only the two major parties were considered			1
although the economy has improved under @entity7 , professor @entity20 said in a statement that it remains to be seen whether voters will consider the economy in relative or absolute terms			2
‘ if it ’s the former , the president may receive credit for the economy ’s trajectory and win a second term			2
in the latter case , @entity22 should pick up a number of states @entity7 won in 2008 , ’ prof @entity20 said			1
this show the latest forecast from the @entity98 which predicts a win for @entity7 in the @entity3 selections although the model devised by @entity104 and @entity105 has predicted the correct results of eight consecutive presidential elections , the data used for analysis was collected in june			1
an update with figures from september is due next month which the team said could have a completely different outcome			0
the results of the model 's calculations are in stark contrast to current polling data			0
the @entity98 ' latest figures for the @entity3 selections forecasts a blue win with 282.6 electoral votes for @entity7 and 255.4 for @entity22			1
track record : this table from the @entity11 model shows its success rate although the figure is well above the 270 electoral votes president @entity7 needs to hold on to his presidency , it is a decrease by 12.8 seats since the last figures on august 15			1
while the race remains a dead heat , a new @entity63 / @entity62 poll out today says that most @entity5 expect president @entity7 to retain the presidency			1
overall , registered voters are about evenly split , with 47 per cent saying they plan to back @entity7 and vice president @entity135 and 46 per cent favoring @entity22 and rep @entity136 of @entity74			1
about one in four voters say they are undecided or could change their minds between now and november 6			0
president @entity7 , who was all smiles yesterday as he arrived at @entity141 in @entity64 yesterday , ought to be worried about the forecast as it has predicted the correct outcome of the electoral votes since 1980 the contours of the race are little changed from june , when an @entity63 - @entity62 survey showed 47 per cent of voters backing @entity7 and 44 per cent siding with @entity22 , suggesting @entity22 's decision earlier in august to tap @entity136 as his running mate was not the game - changing event he may have desired			1
both campaigns have been competing fiercely for a small sweet spot in the middle of the electorate : independent voters who say they do n't lean toward either party			0
@entity22 holds a narrow lead among that group with 41 per cent , compared to 30 per cent for @entity7			1
but few think the @entity165 ticket will win in the end			0
on the trail : @entity22 met supporters at in @entity169 , @entity170 during his presidential campaign yesterday asked to predict the race 's outcome , 58 per cent of adults say they expect @entity7 to be re-elected , whereas just 32 per cent say he will be voted out of office			2
even among those who say they have a great deal of interest in following the campaigns ' bitter back and forth , a majority expect @entity7 to win			2
partisans generally expect their own candidate to win , though @entity16 are less sure about @entity22 than @entity8 are about @entity7 - 83 per cent of @entity8 say @entity7 will be re-elected while 57 per cent of @entity16 think he 'll be voted out of office			1
among those republicans who think @entity7 may pull out a victory is @entity188 , a 78 - year - old from @entity190			0
@entity188 said all of her friends agree that @entity22 would be a better president , yet she 's alarmed to hear even conservative commenters say @entity7 has a good shot at re-election			1
@entity196 pick : a new poll suggests that @entity22 's decision to pick @entity136 , pictured thursday in @entity71 , was not the game - changing event he may have desired ' i think it 's close , ' @entity188 said			2
' a lot closer than i 'd like it to be			0
' the perception that @entity7 has the advantage could cut both ways			0
on the one hand , people like to vote for a winner , so if voters think @entity7 will win , they may be more inclined to cast their lot with him			2
on the other hand , it could backfire for @entity7 and help @entity22 if it drives down turnout among @entity8			2
if @entity7 's supporters think the race is in the bag and their vote is n't necessary , they may stay home			2
but if , like @entity188 , voters suspect the race is close , they 'll be more likely to cast a ballot , said @entity226 , a political analyst at @entity227			0
' it 's less important who people think will win than if they think it 's a close race , ' said @entity226			0
after just over one week on the campaign trail , @entity22 's running mate remains unknown to about a quarter of voters			0
@entity136 is viewed favorably by 40 per cent of registered voters , while 34 per cent see him unfavorably			0
@entity7 's running mate and current vice president @entity135 , has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for a string of gaffes he made during campaign stops			0
on august 14 , @entity135 told a @entity243 , @entity70 , audience that included hundreds of black people : ' [ @entity22 ] said in the first 100 days he ’s going to let the big banks write their own rules , unchain @entity247			0
they 're going to put y'all back in chains			0
' less than 24 hours later , @entity135 appeared to be off by 100 years when he asked another @entity70 crowd : ' folks , where 's it written we can not lead the world in the 20th century in making automobiles ? ' gaffe : @entity135 , pictured on august 14 , sparked outrage with his ' put y'all back in chains ' speech while @entity22 's campaign strategy has been to hammer at @entity7 on job creation and his fiscal policy , @entity7 has been going demographic by demographic in an effort to woo voters			2
the president has alternately tailored his campaign speeches and his ad campaigns to women , older voters and , most recently , new young voters who may not have been old enough to cast a ballot four years ago			0
in each case , @entity7 has used @entity22 and @entity136 as foils , arguing that their policies would limit women 's health care choices , force seniors to pay more for @entity281 and cut back on student loans			2
a little help from my friends : a new tv ad features former president @entity287 speaking in support of @entity7 's economic plan @entity7 's appeal to female voters got an unexpected boost by the eruption of dismay over @entity297 candidate @entity296 's remarks about rape and abortion , prompting an unexpected debate on that social issue			1
the president 's campaign also enlisted the help of former president @entity287 with a tv ad blitz on the economy			1
in the ad , @entity287 speaks directly to the camera and says voters face a ' clear choice ' over which candidate will return the nation to full employment			0
' we need to keep going with his plan , ' @entity287 says of @entity7 in the ad , which will run in eight battleground states .			1
