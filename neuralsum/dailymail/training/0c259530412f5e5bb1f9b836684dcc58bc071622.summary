it is an unusual - although many would argue easy - way to make a quick buck			2
a @entity5 organisation is offering willing volunteers $ 40 ( £ 25 ) for every deposit of poo they make - and it 's all for a good cause			1
the stool samples are being used to fight the superbug @entity11 - in the form of a faecal transplant			1
the treatment is being hailed by many doctors as a ' miracle ' cure for patients where all other treatments - such as antibiotics - have failed			1
a @entity5 organisation is offering willing volunteers $ 40 ( £ 25 ) for every deposit of poo they make			1
the stool samples are being used to fight the superbug @entity11 - in the form of a faecal transplant @entity11 is a bacterial infection that most commonly affects elderly hospital patients			1
it causes severe diarrhoea , fever and painful cramps			0
it can also result in life - threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel			2
patients with recurrent @entity11 only have a 75 per cent chance of survival and are often ill for many months			1
however mounting evidence shows stool transplants from healthy donors can help restore the balance of ' good ' bacteria in the gut to fight infections			1
if successful , the patient starts to feel better almost immediately			0
now , @entity44 , the only independent non-profit stool bank in the @entity5 , is on the hunt for regular stool donors - who can earn up to $ 250 ( £ 156 a week )			1
the organisation was formed in 2012 after the founder watched a friend and family member suffer for 18 months before receiving a successful , life - changing transplant of faecal microbiota			1
it now provides a service collecting , testing and providing life - saving faecal samples to 122 hospitals in 33 states			1
' think of us as a blood bank , but for poop , ' founder @entity61 told @entity63			0
' you should n’t have to fly across the country to get poop			0
' he added that cost-wise , it saves on average $ 17,000 per patient compared to treatment with antibiotics			0
and each stool sample can treat up to five patients			2
in healthy people the bacteria @entity11 lies harmlessly in the gut			1
but the feared infection is caused when antibiotics upset the balance of the intestines			2
while natural bacteria that protect against infection are decimated by the drugs , @entity11 multiply			1
faecal transplantation was first developed in 1958 but rarely used			2
however , in 2011 , a @entity85 study published in the @entity86 showed that 94 per cent of people with recurrent @entity11 could be cured using faecal transplants			1
this can be compared to a cure rate of just 31 per cent of people with recurrent infection who are treated with antibiotics			2
it is most effective in patients who have recurrent @entity11 and who have been treated with antibiotics so many times that they are no longer effective			1
it works because the solution contains ' good ' bacteria which fight the infection			1
if successful , the patient starts to feel better almost immediately			0
mr @entity61 works with gastroenterologists and various other academics to get stool samples to towns and cities within a two - and even four - hour radius			2
@entity44 sells hospitals and independent doctors stool samples for $ 250 a sample			1
this is the price for a transplant via colonoscopy or enema			0
alternatively , 30ml sample for a nasal transplant can be purchased for the same price			0
in this process , a nasogastric tube runs from the nose into the digestive tract			0
and the criteria to be a donor ? volunteers must be between 18 and 50 , have regular bowel movements and make daily trips to the laboratory in @entity130 , @entity131			1
at least four donations a week are required , according to the company 's website			0
it says : ' donors receive $ 40 per sample			0
' if they come in five days in one week , they receive an extra $ 50			0
prospective donors also receive $ 40 for getting tested			0
' they must also have a body mass index under 30 , have taken no antibiotics in the past three months and not travelled or been born outside the @entity5 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , and @entity147 in the past year			2
strict medical screening is in place			0
potential donors fill out a detailed medical questionnaire and their stools are tested for infections , plus the health of the bacteria			1
blood is also screened for conditions such as @entity158 and hepatitis			0
donating involves a 30 - minute visit , where a sample is deposited into a bowl that rests over the toilet , @entity63 reports			0
the company even tries to inject humour into the process			0
there are incentives - such as becoming a ' super pooper ' - or providing the biggest single donation of the month - and dubious - sounding nicknames such as @entity173 , or @entity174			2
@entity11 is a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhoea , fever and painful cramps			1
it can also result in life - threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel @entity44 also encourages donors how to be more productive , so to speak - namely plenty of fibre			1
just earlier this week , @entity185 scientists said @entity11 could be treated using capsules of frozen faeces from healthy people			1
the idea behind the pills was to avoid a more invasive method of faecal transplant			1
the researchers developed a method whereby they could freeze healthy stool samples , enclosing them in capsules for patients to swallow			1
they successfully cured 18 of 20 patients who took part in the study at @entity201 in @entity185 of their diarrohea , improving their condition			0

all the patients had suffered at least three bouts of mild to moderate @entity11 and failed to get better after being given standard antibiotics			2
the study is published the @entity217			0
all the patients had suffered at least three bouts of mild to moderate @entity11 and failed to get better after being given standard antibiotics			2
and last year , dr @entity219 , at the @entity220 in @entity221 , treated the man by pumping his daughter 's faeces through his nose and down into his small bowel			0
the treatment involves mixing stools from a donor - ideally a family member - with saline solution and transferring it by tube through the patient 's nose			2
dr @entity219 said : ' even in the medical world , the topic is a bit of an eyebrow raiser and people are surprised to hear it 's so effective			0
‘ but in recent years we 've seen a rise in more aggressive forms of @entity11 and higher mortality rates , with standard treatments becoming less effective			2
’ he added : ‘ one of the reasons this has not been particularly popular up until now is that we have n't had good studies to back it up			0
‘ then we had an open trial in @entity85 , which was stopped early because it was so effective compared to normal therapies			0
‘ an ethics committee ruled that it was doing so well it would be unfair to continue other methods			0
‘ it has given us the basis to say we have safe , scientific evidence that this is a very good treatment and very safe as well			0

samples are being used to fight the deadly superbug @entity11
healthy stools are given to patients in form of faecal transplant
this helps restore the balance of bacteria in the gut , to fight infection

is trying to recruit healthy donors with ' regular bowel movements '
incentives *include* cash and prizes for the most - and largest - donations
