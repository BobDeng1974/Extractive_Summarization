police have arrested a man in connection with arson attacks on four mobile phone and local radio transmission masts last week – the latest in a wave of attacks apparently perpetrated by a group or individual dubbed the ‘ @entity10 ’			1
the @entity11 revealed two weeks ago that an ‘ eco-terrorist ’ anarchist group calling itself the @entity14 / @entity13 has claimed responsibility for about 50 attacks in the @entity18 area over the past four years			2
they include earlier burnings of phone masts and vehicles belonging to local politicians and government agencies , the disabling of signal cables on two railway lines and the complete destruction by fire ten months ago of the @entity30 , at a cost of £ 18million			0
a man has been arrested in connection with a wave of arson attacks on mobile phone masts serving the @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity40 and @entity41 networks across @entity18 each time those responsible have struck , they have issued statements on the ‘ @entity45 ’ and ‘ 325.nostate ’ websites , justifying their actions as part of a war on the @entity52 state and capitalist society			1
the attacks last monday night on masts serving the @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity40 and ee networks conformed to the usual pattern			1
according to the anarchists ’ statement , they were timed to coincide with the @entity60 , ‘ to show our complicity with the insurgent fighters in @entity63 as they answer massive dispossession and militarised slum clearances for the opulence of the games with street battles and arson ’			0
the statement added : ‘ it should be remembered that the enthralling spectacle … is staged to make the rich yet more money and to distract us from our daily humiliations			0
’ police said the four attacks were probably linked , and that a 32 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of four counts of arson			2
he was released on police bail while inquiries continue			0
