for years , our continental neighbours have been applauded as chic , slim and poised - all achieved seemingly without effort			2
even more infuriatingly , @entity4 women appear to be able to maintain their slender elegance through everything from pregnancy to old age			1
but according to one @entity11 , getting the @entity10 look is n't as effortless as it appears , with pressure to be thin causing some women to resort to extreme measures in a bid to remain slim			0
what 's her secret ? actress @entity20 defines the glamorised perception of the @entity4 woman speaking to the @entity24 , 50 - year - old @entity23 said : ' if you are fat , you will not get that job			1
but if you have the silhouette - chic , ultra-slim , elegant - you are more or less made			0
' the @entity30 art gallery director , who confesses that she 's far from slim , says she enjoys being the exception to the rule - but maintains that she can only get away with it because she is self - employed			2
she explains that being ' fat ' makes her feel free but reveals she struggles to find clothes to fit her in @entity4 shops			1
so how do the rest of the population do it ? according to journalist @entity40 , it 's all down to an intense , if hidden , regime			1
writing in @entity42 , @entity40 revealed that @entity4 women would ' rather die than reveal their beauty secrets '			1
chic : @entity20 ( @entity45 ) and star of @entity47 , @entity48 ( r ) , epitomise @entity4 chic she also alleged that they scour hairdressers for the best colourist to give them a ' natural ' looking hue , and invest in super strong anti-wrinkle creams from the tender age of 25			1
she added : ' they may never talk about dieting , but that does n't mean they do n't watch what they eat			0
' after all , you ca n't gorge on buttered baguettes all day and magically maintain a size eight figure ' , and revealed that almost half smoke cigarettes , known to suppress the appetite , in a bid to stay slim			0
it has even been said , according to @entity24 reports , that the average @entity4 women feels the need to lose at least 2kg ( 4.4lbs ) to fit in			1
cashing in on this is the @entity4 slimming industry , which is booming with diet pills packed onto pharmacy shelves and slimming tips filling the pages of glossy magazines			1
and it has had a chilling impact on the psyche of @entity4 women , with @entity82 , editor - in - chief of @entity83 , a popular guide to health and beauty for teenage girls , concluding that @entity4 women ' dare n't ' grow fat			1
she has n't aged a day ! @entity4 model @entity89 pictured ( @entity45 ) in 1999 and ( @entity90 ) this year is clearly the holder of @entity4 's best kept secrets ' some will even starve themselves because in this society to be a fat female is to be a failure , ' she explained			1
' fat women are seen as stupid			2
their lives must be out - of - control , they are judged ugly , weird losers			0
' @entity101 , a 25 - year - old @entity102 who spent four years studying in @entity4 , added : ' everywhere you look in @entity30 , there are beautiful , slim women			1
' whether it is on fashion billboards or just across the street , you ca n't escape that supposed perfection			0
' everybody aspires to be some sort of @entity112			0
she was the epitome of high octane glamour with that perfect rouge pout , peachy cheeks , @entity118 stripes and flowing pearls			0
' it 's tough , especially when there are boulangeries on every corner			2
however , it seems that it 's going to take years to shake off that glamourised view of @entity4 women , so i guess i 'll be passing on that croissant and hot chocolate ! ' @entity131 the grandmaman of the ' learn from the @entity4 ' genre , this purports to unlock the key to how , despite eating mounds of cheese and foie gras , @entity4 women retain their figures			1
author @entity140 claims that while they do n’t forbid themselves anything , they eat it in moderation			0
rather than obsessing about diets , they take pleasure in staying slim while eating well			0
@entity149 ... is the importance of understanding ' the brevity of time and the immediacy of pleasure ' , writes @entity156			0
in other words , they ’re more pragmatic than the rest of us			0
@entity161 and slim never mind diet , it ’s underwear that ’s are key to @entity4 women ’s figures , according to @entity167			1
' even @entity4 women ’s lingerie helps to keep them slim , ' @entity167 explains			1
‘ it ’s a constant reminder to make choices that pay off in slimness			0
their belief in this principle is demonstrated by the fact that there are almost as many lingerie shops in @entity30 as bakeries			0
’ @entity131 children do n't throw food @entity4 mothers ' seemed to adhere to different rules ' to their @entity183 counterparts			2
@entity184 decided to investigate and , after interviewing dozens of @entity4 mothers , sociologists and doctors , wrote a fascinating book @entity131 women do n't sleep alone aside from an inbuilt knowledge of how to tie a @entity193 scarf , @entity4 women never seem to have any problem finding a boyfriend			2
yet , according to author @entity196 , they do n’t go on dates — instead the secret to finding love @entity4 - style is to adopt a ‘ coterie ’ of fabulous friends through whom you are introduced to men in a relaxed social context			2
of course , it also helps if you ’re slim and fabulous .			0
