by @entity0 the price of nutty snacks and treats is set to soar as almond orchard owners struggle to pollinate their crops because of the dwindling honey bee population			1
almond nuts and milk are a vital ingredient for confectioners and cereal - makers around the world with the global market worth around $ 5 billion ( approximately Â £ 3.1 million )			2
almond orchards in @entity15 , which account for 80 per cent of the world 's crop , require 1.5 million beehives every year for pollination making honey bees vital to crop production			1
but almond farmers have seen the price of renting bees hives for pollination triple in the last decade which is having a knock - on effect on the wholesale cost			0
rising costs : the cost of nutty treats is set to soar as the price of hiring beehives to pollinate almond orchards , pictured near @entity35 in @entity15 , continues to rise as the bee population declines it now costs on average $ 150 ( Â £ 94 ) to hire a single hive with some farmers to pay up to $ 200 ( Â £ 125 ) , the @entity37 reports			1

in the last few years , the annual winter ' die - out ' rate has been 10 per cent higher than usual			0
it has been suggested climate change , pollution , pests or even ' travel stress ' from the bees being shipped from pollination site to pollination site being to blame			0
mounting concerns : there has been a drastic decline in the honey bee population around the world with the annual winter ' die - out ' rate 10 % higher than usual			2
