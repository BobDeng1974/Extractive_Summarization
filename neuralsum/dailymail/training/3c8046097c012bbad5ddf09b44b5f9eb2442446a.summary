the pm 's recent concession that ' there are one or two barnacles still on the ship but by @entity21 they will have been dealt with ' does not bode well for under fire defence minister @entity23			1
last month he gained notoriety for his statement about @entity26 in parliament of ' you wonder why i would n't trust them to build a canoe ? '			0
the @entity3 findings on senator @entity0 , due early next year , was seen as pivotal to the major reshuffle of the @entity8 , however , the @entity32 officially resigned as assistant treasurer on friday @entity9 's flagging popularity , which sees him trailing opposition leader @entity37 by eight points as preferred pm and the @entity40 's dip in voter support has a major @entity8 reshuffle on the cards there are suggestions @entity9 could dump @entity23 from the defence portfolio as early as this weekend but any moves against the embattled defence minister could ignite tensions with foreign minister @entity50 , a known supporter of the senator @entity53 to the shake - up by @entity9 will be two roles ; the troubled portfolio of defence under the watch of @entity58 and the assistant treasurer position now relinquished by @entity60			1
a minor reshuffle of the ranks could be put in place before the new working week while a major overhaul of the senior ministry is more likely by the end of january			0
asked recently whether it was time to reshape the @entity40 front - bench , mr @entity9 said ' at some stage between now and the next election , quite probably , but this is a good front - bench '			1

the @entity77 reports that a source believes ' the threshold question is @entity0 ( @entity0 )			0
the pm does n't want @entity0 to be in the mix but he is '			2
mr @entity9 was waiting on the outcome of the @entity3 inquiry into @entity60 , which was due in january but could now be delayed			2
it 's believed he will escape any official sanctions over the inquiry into his involvement with @entity88			0
