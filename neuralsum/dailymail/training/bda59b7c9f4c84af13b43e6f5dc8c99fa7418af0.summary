by @entity0 last updated at 11:55 am on 20th december 2011 holidaymakers will no longer be charged for purchasing foreign currency with a debit card in the @entity4 after banks were pressured into changing complex levies which earnt them more than £ 1 billion last year			1
the @entity8 led an investigation into the banks ' confusing charges and the poor information they provide for travellers after @entity14 raised a ' super complaint ' about the practices			2
it is estimated that around 40 per cent of foreign currency purchases in the @entity4 are made using cards rather than cash , with banks charging 1.5 to 2 per cent of the amount exchanged just for the transaction			1
scrapped : banks have agreed to stop charging holidaymakers for buying foreign currency with debit cards @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32 have all agreed to remove the charges for buying currency with debit cards after discussions with the @entity8			1
@entity14 said it costs banks and credit card providers an average of 9p and 37p respectively to process debit and credit card payments			2
but the charges currently levied mean a holidaymaker trying to convert £ 500 into euros could be charged up to £ 30 to do it			2
banks have also agreed to review certain marketing practices , including the use of ' 0 per cent commission ' deals , which the watchdog argued is misleading as the transactions are not fee - free			0
from the end of 2012 , consumers will be able to use their debit cards to buy foreign exchange from banks , bureaux de change , the @entity59 and travel agents without any hidden charges simply for paying on a card			1
@entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 already allow holidaymakers to purchase foreign currency without an extra charge for using a debit card			1
@entity70 , @entity14 chief executive , said : ' it is particularly welcome that the @entity8 has worked with the big banks to stop withdrawal fees being charged when people buy currency on their card in the @entity4			2
it is only right that this unfair cost , which effectively charges customers for the privilege of taking money out of their own account , is stopped			0
' however , despite this positive step , transactions for debit card purchases abroad are unaffected , as are fees for using a credit card to purchase foreign currency			1
banks were also rapped on the knuckles for the complex charges holidaymakers incur when using their cards abroad and have agreed to give ' clearer , more accessible ' information about them			1
marketing ploys : banks will look into campaigns which are based around 0 per cent commission deals @entity28 , @entity64 , @entity32 , @entity100 , @entity30 and @entity101 and @entity102 have said they would show the charges that travellers incur by using their cards abroad - including the typical ' loading fee ' of 3 per cent - more clearly on monthly and annual statements			1
@entity14 found that some 70 per cent of holidaymakers take foreign cash with them on their trip with one in five using credit or debit cards abroad			1
it is estimated that @entity4 travellers altogether take around £ 10 billion in cash when they go overseas			0
@entity117 , head of banking at moneysupermarket.com welcomed the changes , saying it would encourage more competition between banks , which in turn benefits the consumer			0
' i welcome anything that brings more transparency to the market and lets people become more informed about their spending , ' mr @entity117 told @entity132			0
' the important thing is that consumers will be able to differentiate between charges , helping to create competition as people become aware of different deals			0
this in turn should reduce costs for the consumer			0
' @entity143 , chief executive of the @entity8 , said : ' companies should be earning profits by competing to provide the best value products and services , not through charges that are hard for customers to identify or interpret			0
' will buying travel money be cheaper ? currently , buying £ 500 worth of euros over the counter with your debit card would mean an additional fee of between £ 10 and £ 30			2
five banks – @entity29 , @entity32 , @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity31 – currently impose a charge of 1.5 and 2 per cent on customers using their debit cards to withdraw foreign currency before leaving the @entity4			1
they have all agreed to scrap these charges by the end of 2012 under the new rules			0
it will mean that travellers can use their debt cards to buy foreign currency from banks , bureau de change , the @entity59 and travel agents without being charged to use their debit card			1
there will be still be a charge for credit cards			0
the @entity175 and @entity176 has agreed that banks and lenders will give clearer , more accessible information about using cards abroad on websites , statements and through call centres			1
what about when you ’re abroad ? currently banks and credit card companies hide the cost of using your card abroad within the items travellers have bought			1
they will now have to show the charge , typically called a ‘ loading fee ’ usually of around 3 per cent , separately on bank statements			0
@entity28 / @entity65 , @entity64 , @entity32 , @entity100 , @entity30 / @entity101 and @entity102 have agreed to display the actual charges incurred by customers for using cards abroad far more clearly on their monthly and annual statements			1
this will mean that customers can more easily work out how much they ’re paying for foreign currency and give them the ability to shop around to get better deals			2
what about pre-paid cards ? pre-paid cards , which are loaded with currency before you go on holiday , often advertise 0 per cent commission offers but sting customers by pushing up exchange rates so they are not fee free – the @entity8 is forcing firms to review this strategy to reveal the exact costs			0
will the changes lead to less generous exchange rates ? as firms are forced to cut back on money making fees when proving currency there are some fears this may mean less generous exchange rates for customers			0
a spokesman from @entity14 said that it would hope that competition between banks and other players such as the @entity59 and bureaux de change would keep rates competitive			0
however , it is up to individual firms to decide at what rate they set the exchange at			0
if banks and others wish to offset the revenue lost from a ban on debit card fees with higher exchange rates , the rules mean customers will at least be able to identify and compare the advertised exchange rate of different providers .			2

banks can no longer charge travellers for buying foreign currency with debit cards
the 1.5 - 2 per cent charges raised £ 1 billion in 2010
@entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and the *co-operative* agree to scrap the charge
banks will have to give clearer information about the fees levied for card use abroad
