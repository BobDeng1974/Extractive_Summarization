by @entity0 imagine a miniature robo - surgeon sliding into your body through an incision in your stomach			0
once inside , the robot can expertly manoeuvre its way around the abdominal cavity , which has been filled with gas to make more room for work			0
it can then perform procedures such as an emergency appendectomy or perforate a gastric ulcer			0
working in collaboration with @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely - operated fist - sized robot doctor			1
the robot is due to have its first zero - gravity test in the coming months to prove its dexterity and ability to manipulate objects , according to a report @entity36			1
the 0.9lb ( 0.4kg ) has two arms fitted with tools to hold , cauterise and suture tissue , while its head is a small video camera			1
would you trust a robot with surgical tools ? working in collaboration with @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely - operated fist - sized robot doctor the 0.9lb ( 0.4kg ) has two arms fitted with tools to hold , cauterise and suture tissue , while its head is a small video camera			1
the camera feed is sent to a control station , where a human surgeon operates it using joysticks			1
the robot would be remote - controlled , although controlling it from as far away as @entity59 would mean impracticable delays in communication			2
instead , the plan is to train astronauts to use the robot to perform select surgeries on each other			1
the camera feed is sent to a control station , where a human surgeon operates it using joysticks			1
' while this work is in an early phase , the minimal invasiveness of this approach could enable its use in remote locations such as on a moon or @entity80 colony , ' researchers wrote in a technical paper on the prototype			0
the robot would be remote - controlled , although controlling it from as far away as @entity59 would mean impracticable delays in communication			2
instead , @entity18 plans to train astronauts to use the robot to perform select surgeries on each other			1
currently , astronauts on the @entity89 who face medical emergencies can be sent back to @entity59 in an escape capsule within a matter of hours			2
but for longer missions , such to @entity80 , coming home quickly wo n’t be possible			0
so far , tests using the prototype have performed on pigs			0
the next step , said @entity18 , is to work in human cadavers			2
escape plan : currently , astronauts on the @entity89 who face medical emergencies can be sent back to @entity59 in an escape capsule within a matter of hours a recent study of 12 astronauts show the heart becomes more spherical when exposed to long periods of microgravity in space			2
the change could lead to significant cardiac problems , according to research to be presented at the @entity114 ’s 63rd @entity113			0
with implications for an eventual manned mission to @entity80 , the findings represent an important step toward understanding how a spaceflight of 18 months or more could affect astronauts ’ heart health			0
' the heart does n’t work as hard in space , which can cause a loss of muscle mass , ' said @entity127 , managing director of , @entity128 and @entity129 at @entity18			0
' that can have serious consequences after the return to @entity59 , so we ’re looking into whether there are measures that can be taken to prevent or counteract that loss			0
' @entity18 said exercise regimens developed for astronauts could also be used to help maintain heart health in people on @entity59 who have severe physical limitations .			1

prototype has been created by @entity26 - based @entity24 and @entity18
0.9lb ( 0.4kg ) device has tools that can grab , cauterise and suture tissue
its head is fitted with a camera which sends a feed back to control station
@entity18 said astronauts could be trained to use the robot to perform select surgeries on each other
