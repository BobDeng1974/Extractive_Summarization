@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 on sunday called climate change perhaps the world 's ' most fearsome ' destructive weapon and mocked those who deny its existence or question its causes , comparing them to people who insist the @entity11 is flat			1
in a speech to @entity14 students , civic leaders and government officials , @entity0 tore into climate change skeptics			1
he accused them of using shoddy science and scientists to delay steps needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at the risk of imperiling the planet			1
a day earlier , the @entity1 and @entity26 announced an agreement to cooperate more closely on combating climate change			1
@entity1 officials hope that will help encourage others , including developing countries like @entity14 and @entity33 , to follow suit			2
scientists say such changes are leading to drought , wildfires , rising sea levels , melting polar ice , plant and animal extinctions and other extreme conditions			0
also in the @entity60 speech , @entity0 said everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately			2
' we simply do n't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation , ' he said , referring to what he called ' big companies ' that ' do n't want to change and spend a lot of money ' to act to reduce the risks			0
@entity0 later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders			0
' we should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts , ' @entity0 told the audience at a @entity1 @entity83 in a shopping mall			1
' nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits			0
' @entity11 : @entity0 dismisses those who do n't believe in climate change as members of ' the @entity11 ' ' the science is unequivocal , and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand , ' @entity0 said			1
' we do n't have time for a meeting anywhere of the @entity11 , ' @entity0 said the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the @entity11 's rising temperatures			0
he outlined a litany of recent weather disasters , particularly flooding and typhoons in @entity113 , and their impact on commerce , agriculture , fishing and daily living conditions for billions of people			0
' this city , this country , this region , is really on the front lines of climate change , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's not an exaggeration to say that your entire way of life here is at risk			0
' he added : ' in a sense , climate change can now be considered the world 's largest weapon of mass destruction , perhaps even , the world 's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction			2
' the solution , @entity0 said , is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies			0
he noted the president @entity147 is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to their leaders to join			0
front lines : @entity0 said places like @entity60 were the ' front lines ' of the effects of climate change the @entity1 - @entity26 statement issued just after @entity0 left @entity157 on saturday said the two countries agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse gases , including reducing vehicle emissions , improving energy efficiency of buildings and other measures			1
@entity157 and @entity166 launched a climate change discussion last year , promising progress in five areas : reducing vehicle emissions ; advanced electric power grids ; capturing and storing carbon emissions ; gathering greenhouse gas data ; and building efficiency			2
@entity0 was in @entity14 on the last leg of a three - nation tour of @entity113 that started in @entity177			2
after leaving @entity14 on monday , he planned to visit @entity178 in the @entity179			0
before the climate change speech , @entity0 toured @entity60 's @entity181 , one of the largest in the world , to pay his respects to @entity14 's @entity186 majority population .			1

in a speech to students in @entity14 , @entity0 *warned* of the disastrous effects of climate change
he accused those who deny its existence of falling for ' shoddy science '
@entity0 insisted science supports his theory on climate change and those who deny it are ' burying their heads in the sand
