by @entity0 last updated at 5:19 am on 12th october 2011 the mother of a 10 - month - old girl reported missing last week is preparing for her ' inevitable ' arrest as police run out of leads , according to her fiancé 's sister			1
crews spent hours on tuesday emptying and then searching a 36ft well at an abandoned home in the @entity11 , @entity12 neighbourhood where baby @entity13 was reported missing , but once again authorities came up empty - handed			1
@entity16 , who is the aunt of the missing baby , said @entity13 is getting ready to be taken into custody and charged in connection with her baby 's disappearance			1
neither parent has been named as a suspect , but ms @entity32 has said police told her she failed a lie detector test			2
they did not show her paperwork supporting that claim , however			0
criticising the investigation , @entity16 told @entity35 : ' it 's what the police do			2
they do n't have any leads so they just have to pin it on somebody			0
' ms @entity16 said she thinks the police are spending more time investigating the family rather than looking for viable suspects			1
she added that she has no doubt that that neither her brother @entity13 or ms @entity32 has anything to do with @entity58 's disappearance			1
' anybody who spends any time with them , you know it 's not true - she 's genuine - she loves that child			2
it 's her baby … she would never anything to hurt her , ' she told @entity35			0
' she does n't care what happens to her , she does n't care what people say about her , she does n't care what people think about her , all she cares about it getting @entity58 home			0
' missing : it is a week since 10 - month - old @entity13 has last been seen disappeared : police have been asking neighbours if they have seen a homeless man in his twenties riding a bicycle in the area as they search for clues to help find missing @entity58 ms @entity16 's comments came as authorities searched a drainage ditch behind the parents ' home - among the more elaborate efforts authorities have made in their search for baby @entity58			1
her parents reported her missing after her father got home from work about 4am october 4			2
@entity13 and @entity13 said a window on their home had been tampered with , and they believe someone abducted their daughter while @entity33 and the couple 's two sons slept nearby			1
police have searched the couple 's home , nearby wooded areas , an industrial park , landfills and sewers			2
they 've checked out more than 300 tips , including at least one report of suspicions about a couple with a child near @entity58 's age			0
authorities said the house that stood on the same property had already been condemned , and about an hour after the search ended , wrecking crews came in , demolished it and carted the pieces away in dump trucks			2
a caller had suggested police search the property			2
' there was no reason not to search it , ' said captain @entity130 , spokesman for the @entity131			0
' we did everything we could to check it out , and there was nothing there			0
and we 're moving on to the next lead			0
' none of their efforts have turned up any clues , and they still have no suspects , they said on tuesday			0
the search of the abandoned property came a day after a court ordered @entity11 television stations to submit all footage of interviews with the girl 's family and friends			1
helping with enquiries : the parents of missing 10 - month old @entity13 , @entity13 , right , and @entity13 , are reportedly co-operating with police again gone : @entity13 reportedly went missing from her parents home in @entity11 last week grand jury subpoenas from @entity160 @entity159 were sent late on monday to at least four network affiliates in @entity11 , according to their websites			1
the subpoenas asked the television stations to submit ' all footage , including raw footage of any interviews or statements given by neighbours , family or friends of the family , regarding missing baby , @entity13			1
' the subpoenas , which were requested by the @entity160 prosecutor 's office , ordered at least two of the stations to appear with the footage in court on october 18			1
@entity180 , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said the subpoenas were needed to prevent broadcasters from destroying video they might otherwise discard because it could be needed later			0
the subpoenas were issued by a sitting grand jury , not one called specifically for this case			0
@entity190 , vice-president for news at @entity192 , said the station would provide all footage it had aired about the case			0
but he said the station would not hand over raw footage because workers ' routinely recycle what we use			0
' @entity202 @entity201 , a professor at @entity203 , said investigators may want the footage to find inconsistencies in the parents ' accounts of their daughter 's disappearance			1
' it could mean that they have one or both of the parents as suspects , and they are developing evidence of everything they said in the past and prior to the arrest , ' @entity201 said tuesday			1
' to show that someone 's story has shifted over time can also be very damning			0
@entity223 said yesterday that police have been questioning the parents about a homeless man in his twenties , who was seen riding a red bike in the area			1
police also may want the footage to review ' the landscape around the house , ' shortly after the disappearance was reported , @entity201 said			1
' it could be that these visuals of the immediate area are important , ' he said			0
