putting your thumb up is a recognised hand signal the world over , and the ultimate sign of approval			2
so it was a good choice of gesture for @entity8 , 25 , and her fiancé @entity9 , 30 , to pick as their go - to pose while on an around - the - world trip			1
the couple documented their mammoth journey , spanning months and continents , by capturing photographs of their thumbs in front of landmarks , skyscrapers , beautiful scenery and historical monuments			2
no landmark was left unphotographed @entity8 , a social media manager and travel blogger from @entity37 told @entity38 : ' it started as just a fun way to record where we 'd been , whenever we saw something gorgeous or memorable we 'd take a photo of a thumbs up in front of it			1
' as we travelled more it became a running joke , and we 'd make sure we did it everywhere we visited			0
' the duo 's adventure kicked off in @entity28 two years ago			2
after living in @entity53 for six months they visited @entity54 before passing through @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity59 , thumbs at the ready			1
this time in @entity61 in @entity59 during a day trip to see the @entity63 view of @entity65 by night from the @entity67 roof top bar of @entity68 commenting on the aesthetics of the thumb photos @entity71 , who writes the blog @entity74 and then some says : ' they are n’t great photos			1
they ’re not even lit properly in most cases			0
but they tell our story			0
they show where we ’ve been and how far we ’ve come			0
' with so much time in front of the camera , the couple 's thumbs have won attention online			0
@entity90 describes the @entity91 in @entity92 as ' one of the most beautiful places i 've ever been ' on a cold day in @entity96 in @entity97 and @entity9 's gesture still takes centre stage to date , they 've been photographed front of the @entity32 in @entity33 , the @entity63 in @entity61 , @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity96 in @entity97 , the @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , also in @entity33			1
@entity8 says , ' my favourite photo is the one we took in @entity109 at @entity110 ( its the darkly lit one , with a christmas tree in the background )			2
a view - behind the thumbs - of @entity53 in @entity28 on a clear day from the top of a cable car ' the most thumbs up moment of my life so far ' : photo taken after @entity9 proposed to @entity90 in @entity109 @entity8 broke her finger in @entity28 zip lining but she still managed give a version of the salute ' it was taken moments after @entity127 proposed to me , in the exact spot it happened			1
which might be the most ' thumbs up ' moment of my life so far			0
' ' we get married next year - so of course i 'm hoping to get a photo of us after saying ' i do ' with the wedding rings included ! ' ' i think the photos sum us up as a couple , we 're very laid back , happy and just take things as they come			0
' sometimes a landmark deserved a full body shot			0
