but the scheme collapsed at the end of last year and there are fears the players were victims of a ponzi - style scheme			1
in such a fund , money from new investors is simply redistributed to existing members , rather than being invested to generate returns , with the result that the scheme eventually collapses			1

mr @entity18 has not been seen at his apartment since the end of last week			2
his @entity78 , which he recently had repainted , has also disappeared			2

there he met a number of players seeking to make investments			0
a top international at a leading @entity2 club said : ‘ one young player who invested tried to withdraw his money but found he could n’t , and a senior professional helped him get it back			0
this is what sparked the collapse , as lots of players got concerned and then tried to get their money out and could n’t			0
those players who have invested smaller amounts they can afford – £ 10,000 , £ 20,000 or £ 30,000 – are washing their hands of it			1
it ’s staggering – it was cash for cash , there were no receipts			0
’ a source claimed footballers at mr @entity18 ’s former club @entity19 invested £ 1.3 million			1
