@entity1 ’s fate as @entity3 leader will hang in the balance and he could feel ‘ duty bound ’ to resign if @entity8 votes for independence , his allies conceded last night			1
even some cabinet ministers who are supportive of the prime minister ’s leadership admit his future will be ‘ difficult ’ – despite his insistence he would ‘ emphatically ’ not quit in the event of a @entity17 vote			1
one told the @entity18 he would have a responsibility to stay on and deal with the aftermath of @entity8 voting to break away but could then be forced out or feel ‘ duty - bound ’ to go			1
officers on the @entity3 ’ @entity31 , which represents backbench mps , are understood to have quietly canvassed opinion over the weekend on whether mr @entity1 might lose a vote of confidence			1
the prime minister has effectively ceded control of the no campaign to his old enemy @entity40 , and is not expected to appear in @entity8 this week			1
strategists admit their party is still so divisive north of the border that too much exposure of senior conservative ministers might prove counterproductive			2
later this week , the prime minister is expected to back proposals for rapid devolution of more powers over taxation , public spending and welfare rates to @entity8 in the event of a no vote			2
he has also urged @entity57 figures to halt the separatist surge by making the ‘ emotional case ’ for preserving the @entity60 , rather than focusing on negative warnings			2
after what were seen as crisis talks with the @entity64 at @entity65 at the weekend , mr @entity1 is understood to have insisted that the campaign focus on the ‘ heart rather than the head ’ in its final ten days			1
‘ he wants to make the emotional argument about all that @entity71 and @entity8 have achieved together – and all they can continue to achieve , ’ said one source			2
under conservative party rules , a vote of no confidence in mr @entity1 is triggered if at least 15 per cent of backbenchers – currently 46 mps – write to @entity78 , the chairman of the @entity31 , requesting one			0
some @entity3 mps say mr @entity1 ’s credibility will be shattered if , as head of what is officially called the @entity3 , he has and presided over the end of the @entity85			1
one minister said the prime minister would also face questions about his concessions to @entity90 on the timing of the referendum , the ballot ’s wording and the extension of the vote to 16 - and 17 - year - olds			0
the prime minister has effectively ceded control of the no campaign to his old enemy @entity40 , pictured , and is not expected to appear in @entity8 this week ‘ the way the question is worded so that @entity105 is the vote for the @entity60 has made it seem a negative rather than a positive thing , ’ the minister said			1
after the election of the @entity111 government in 2011 , the government originally insisted must hold the referendum by september 2013			0
but a later vote was permitted in exchange for first minister @entity90 agreeing to a single yes or no question			0
he initially wanted a second question on so - called ‘ devo max ’ – the devolution of more powers			1
some senior conservatives now believe it was a fundamental error to exclude a ‘ third way ’ from the ballot paper , since it would have allowed @entity126 to campaign against @entity105 while urging those voters who want change to back a ‘ best of both worlds ’ option			1
sir @entity131 , the former @entity3 foreign secretary , pointed out that more than 90 per cent of @entity3 voters in @entity8 are backing the no campaign , while @entity57 has steadily leached support to @entity17			1
the latest polling suggests as many as 35 per cent of @entity57 voters could back independence			0
‘ you can hardly blame the prime minister for @entity57 people deserting their own party , ’ he said			0
labour leader @entity142 is also likely to face a leadership crisis if @entity8 votes @entity17			2
labour leader @entity142 , who is also likely to face a leadership crisis if @entity8 votes yes @entity145 , writing on the @entity57 supporters ’ website @entity149 , said he would shoulder ‘ most blame ’ in the event of a @entity17 vote and would also have to resign			1
‘ it was the hapless @entity57 campaign for the @entity154 in 2011 that let the @entity111 in power			0
it is a disaster that @entity142 oversaw but has never been fully held to account for within @entity57 circles , ’ he said			0
‘ for the @entity111 to gain a majority required @entity57 ineptitude on a grand scale			0
ever since , @entity57 has provided woeful opposition to the @entity111 in @entity8			0
‘ since the referendum campaign began it has been crystal clear that @entity57 voters would decide the vote			2
unlike @entity1 , @entity142 had a chance to convince his own supporters and turn the referendum			0
he did not intervene often enough or effectively			0
