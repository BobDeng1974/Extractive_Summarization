by @entity0 last updated at 9:28 pm on 13th january 2012 she stole his heart simply by suggesting they steal some donuts			2
it seems the way to @entity9 governor @entity8 's affections really is through his stomach as he revealed to @entity12 that one of the reasons he fell for his wife @entity15 was when she suggested they make an illicit late - night donut run			1
@entity8 talks love , weight and politics with the chat show queen for a special hour - long interview , filmed at @entity8 's home in @entity24 , scheduled to air this sunday at 9pm on @entity25			1
' she was fun in a different way than i 'd ever experienced with anybody i 'd ever dated			2
she was very spontaneous , ' @entity8 told @entity12			1
' spontaneous like ? ' @entity12 asked			1
' let 's go break into the kitchen in the dining hall at college because we smell that they are baking donuts for the next morning , ' he recalled @entity15 saying			0
' so let 's sneak in and steal some of the donuts now			0
' true romance : he revealed he fell in love with his wife at university when she suggested they break into the canteen and steal some donuts @entity8 and @entity12 spoke at length about controlling their weight and managing the criticism surrounding it - specifically what it feels like to be on the short end of a @entity37 fat joke			1
' it did n't bother you ? ' @entity12 asked			1
' because let me tell you , when @entity37 was making jokes about me , it bothered me			2
' ' i think i was girded for it , @entity12 , i really do , ' @entity8 responded , saying he had developed ' a shell about it '			1
the conversation also hit more serious overtones as @entity12 asked him , @entity15 and their four children - @entity87 , 18 , @entity90 , 15 , @entity91 , 11 , and @entity92 , 8 - about the pressure of being asked to run for president			1
@entity90 lamented to @entity12 about being banned from having a @entity96 page			1
' by the way , who backed us up on you not having a @entity96 account ? ' @entity8 pointed out			0
' @entity102 , ' co-creator of the social networking site , @entity90 answered , reluctantly			0
friends : @entity9 governor @entity8 ( left ) and @entity107 mayor @entity106 ( second from right ) with @entity12 and @entity102 who told @entity8 's daughter not to open a @entity96 page @entity8 , @entity102 and @entity107 mayor @entity106 , a @entity111 , appeared on @entity12 's talk show in september 2010 to announce that @entity96 was pledging a $ 100 million donation to the @entity107 public schools			1
@entity8 said he wanted his daughter to wait until she was a little older , given his position , so that she can better handle the ' opportunity for mischief ' that @entity96 provides — a position he said @entity102 supported			0
@entity96 requires that members are 13 years and older but around 7.5million users in the @entity123 are said to be under 13 , with about five million under the age of ten			0
while @entity106 , who has been rumored as a potential candidate to run against @entity8 in 2013 , is close to @entity12 and her best friend , @entity106 , @entity8 met the daytime icon for the first time at the taping of the show about @entity96 's donation			1
@entity8 had been in office less than a year when he first met @entity12			2
elected in a @entity133 - leaning @entity9 2009 , @entity8 quickly became @entity135 sensation and darling of the @entity137 for his blunt style , and pressure quickly mounted for him to run for the @entity140 in 2012			1
he briefly considered changing his mind against running this fall , but did n't and instead endorsed @entity143 , whom he has been campaigning hard for ever since			2
@entity12 , who openly endorsed @entity144 during the 2008 presidential elections , asked @entity8 what advice he had for the president and what he thought @entity144 's chances for re-election were			1
surprisingly , @entity8 warned that those who underestimate @entity144 as a campaigner do so at their own peril			2
support : @entity9 gov @entity8 has endorsed @entity143 , left , for the 2012 presidential race but said those who underestimate @entity144 do so at their own peril ' he is as good a politician as i 've ever seen ... he 's really good at it			1
and i think he 's very charismatic			0
and i think he 's genuine			0
i think what he says he believes he believes			0
that 's a very dangerous politician			0
' but @entity8 was quick to say that @entity144 was weak in governing , and needed to work on his relationships with adversaries — something @entity8 has credited with helping him pass major changes to @entity9 's pension and health benefits systems			1
' if he had asked me a year ago , i would have said , ' so , mr. president , make @entity172 your best friend in the whole world			0
have him over for dinner			0
have him for golf regularly			0
call him on the phone talk , to him , charm him , make him your pal			2
' so why did n't he run for the @entity140 himself ? @entity8 said he was n't sure that his ' true compass ' thought he was ready			0
' is that compass telling you that you may be ready four years from now ? ' @entity12 asked			2
' who knows ? it depends on who wins			0
is the president re-elected ? does a @entity137 win ? i do n't know , ' @entity8 said			0
' but in terms of me , i 'll be much more ready four years from now than i am now			0
' first look : governor @entity8 on @entity12 's @entity193 tune in sunday , january 15 to see @entity12 travel to the home of @entity9 governor @entity8 to discuss his lifelong struggle with weight , why he resisted a run for the @entity140 and more .			1
