by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 12:32 est , 16 november 2012 it is the size of a fingernail with battered edges to match			0
but this silver coin , discovered in a field , could be worth up to £ 80,000 if proved to be a genuine @entity7 antique			1
@entity8 , 58 , and @entity9 , 38 , say the coin - which is the size and weight of a penny - is only the second one in history to be found featuring the short - lived emperor @entity14			1
this is only the second @entity7 coin ever found featuring the @entity14			1
it is estimated to fetch £ 80,000 at auction , but could go for a lot more			1
some experts think it is a 15c forgery a metal detecting expert , @entity22 , certainly believes the coin is genuine and that it was minted to mark the brief rise to power of @entity14 in @entity26			1
father - of - two mr @entity8 , who made the find in a field near @entity30 , @entity31 , on november 7 , said : ' the first coin with @entity14 was found in a collection in @entity34 in the 1980s			1
it sold in 1991 for £ 40,000			2
' it was in a private collection that dated back a century so there was no way of validating whether the coin was authentic or a contemporary forgery , made in the @entity7			1
' our find is ground - breaking because it validates the first coin and gives weight to the history of @entity14 - it really will change the history books			1
' but coin specialist and renowned academic @entity49 , who is @entity51 of the @entity52 , disagrees that the coin is genuine			2
' he said : ' i do n't believe any coins of @entity14 were ever made and this one is probably a 15th century forgery			1
' the only source for our knowledge of him is a controversial history book , written at the end of the 4th century @entity26 , much of which was made up			2
@entity8 ( @entity65 ) takes a closer look at the coin featuring emperor @entity14			1
mr @entity8 and @entity9 ( @entity69 ) proudly display the metal detectors that helped them find a the rare @entity7 coin in @entity31 ' it says that there were 30 tyrants who all vied for control of the @entity77 when things got a bit messy in the late 3rd century @entity26 and lots of people were declared emperor			1
' many of these 30 tyrants never had coins made , which is a sign of a true emperor			2
' but in the @entity88 , when coin collecting was fashionable , people thought these men should have had coins so they made them			0
' this coin has been made from the same dye , or mould , as another in the @entity95 , which is widely believed to be fake			0
@entity14 was a @entity7 usurper who ‘ took the purple ’ against @entity99 in @entity26			1
an ambitious soldier , he proclaimed himself joint emperor with @entity103 after being asked by the people of @entity105 ( @entity106 ) , who had started a rebellion against @entity99			0
@entity14 was married to a woman named @entity109 ; at the time of his usurpation he had one son , @entity112 , aged four			1
on @entity99 ’ return from fighting in @entity114 , he forced @entity14 to retreat north			1
@entity14 apparently had some connections to the @entity116 and he had hoped to rally them to his cause			2
they appear , however , to have betrayed him and promptly handed him over to @entity118			0
@entity118 had him killed in 281 but spared his family			0
@entity118 was killed by his own troops sometime between september or october 282			0
' there is no context to this find either - only single coins , not hoards , have been found so their provenance is difficult to assess			0
' unless someone finds a hoard of these coins , i 'm going to remain very sceptical that there were ever any coins made for @entity14			2
' mr @entity8 , a body shop manager , said that when the duo found the coin they did n't recognise the emperor 's features			2
he and mr @entity9 photographed the coin out in the field and put the image on a @entity142 site used by metal detector specialists			2
' we started getting messages back from people telling us that we really should take it to be valued properly			0
all these figures started coming at us and they 're constantly changing , even now			0
' mr @entity9 , a self - employed joiner , added that they would give a proportion of the proceeds to the farmer who owns the field and gave them permission to go detecting			0
the lucky duo , of @entity157 , will then share the remainder between them 50/50 , as they had always agreed			0
he explained that a single coin was not considered treasure trove and therefore did not need to go to an inquest , but it had been recorded by the finds liaison officer at the @entity165			0
mr @entity22 said the find ' made an astounding contribution to world numismatics by this find of a single debased silver coin '			0
@entity171 , of specialist auctioneers and valuers of coins , @entity175 , said it was an ' extremely rare and valuable coin , possibly the second known '			0
he said that at auction , it could fetch up to £ 50,000 , but this estimate was later raised to between £ 60,000 and £ 80,000			1
mr @entity8 added : ' i probably will be a bit sad to say goodbye to the coin but to be honest it 's become a bit of a burden - i 'm looking forward to someone taking it off my hands			0
' this has definitely whet my appetite for metal detecting - in fact @entity9 and i were back out with our detectors just after we found the coin			1

after 30 years of metal detecting , pair get lucky by finding @entity7 coin
only the second found featuring @entity14 , it could fetch £ 80,000
some experts say it will *rewrite* the history books , others think it is a 15c forgery
