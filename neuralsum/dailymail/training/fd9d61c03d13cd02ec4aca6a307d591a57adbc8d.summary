by @entity0 time for debate : @entity2 is calling for a review of drugs laws after his recent visit to @entity6 @entity2 is calling for @entity7 to undertake a major review of drugs laws after seeing first - hand the devastating consequences that rising cocaine demand has wrought upon @entity6			1
despite robust legislation against @entity15 drugs , the deputy prime minister added that cocaine use has tripled in 20 years , while one in five young people have admitted to taking drugs in the last year			1
his calls for reformation come just a week after he visited @entity6 , where he met president @entity22 , as well as former paramilitaries , guerillas and human rights representatives			2
@entity6 is just one of a number of @entity29 countries that are demanding an alternative to the war on drugs			1
they argue military action does little to quell demand for drugs , but instead perpetuates conflict and violence			2
writing in today 's observer , @entity2 said : ' many people in @entity7 and the rest of @entity40 will be unaware of the impact drug use in western nations has on countries on the frontline of the drugs trade			1
' he added : ' if @entity7 were fighting a war where 2,000 people died every year , where increasing numbers of our young people were recruited by the enemy and our opponents were always a step ahead , there would be outcry and loud calls for change			2
' instead , @entity2 argues , @entity7 has resisted ' a proper debate ' about the need for a change of strategy			1
he revealed the @entity63 are conducting a review of alternative approaches adopted by other countries and said he wished to see the issue brought to the table in 2016 , when the @entity69 is due to hold a meeting to discuss potential drug reforms			0
@entity2 wrote : ' the @entity7 can lead the debate in @entity40 and @entity40 can lead the debate in the world			2
but we must be prepared to start afresh with a new mindset and be prepared to do things differently			0
' the deputy prime minister 's comments will be seen by some as designed to distance the @entity63 from the @entity81 ahead of the next general election - and will dismay those who say reform will encourage drug taking			1
however , his pro-reform stance will bolster the argument of campaigners who say alternatives are needed to help not just drug users , but also countries like @entity6 which have been heavily affected by the growing drugs trade			1
impact : @entity2 also saw the devastation wrought by drugs during his visit to @entity97 in 2011 @entity98 : demand for @entity6 's coca leaves , used to produce cocaine , are on the rise despite drugs laws ( file pic ) just this week , @entity105 revealed one of its new approaches to the drug problem after @entity109 became home to the country 's first crackpipe vending machines			1
installed on the city 's @entity114 , the machines offer @entity116 for only 25 cents and are intended to curb the spread of disease among drug users			0
@entity120 , the director of the @entity121 in @entity109 argued that harm reduction strategies lead to overall decreases in the infectious disease rates and make addicts more likely to get treatment by introducing them to health professionals			0
' this is one piece of a larger puzzle , ' @entity120 said			0
' you have to have treatment , you have to have detox , you have to have safe spaces to use your drug of choice , and you have to have safe and clean supplies			0
' @entity120 argued that as every new hiv or hepatitis case could cost taxpayers up to $ 250,000 in medical treatment a mere 25 cents for a new pipe was a bargain			0
bargain : addiction specialists say crackpipe machines could save taxpayers thousands in medical costs by curbing disease rates			0
