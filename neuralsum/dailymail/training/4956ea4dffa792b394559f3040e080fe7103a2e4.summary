by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:02 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 10 september 2013 three leading gyms have been forced to give their 1.4million members fairer and cheaper cancellation rights			0
@entity5 , @entity6 and the @entity7 will change the smallprint in contracts to make it easier to quit without being hit with punishing penalty charges			0
the move follows pressure from the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) and concern that some members were being charged fees of more than £ 500 to pull out			1
locked in ? if you are no longer able to go to the gym it may be easier now to cancel your contract @entity23 , which is owned by the @entity24 ’ den star @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , were required to end the same rip - off earlier this year			1
fears were raised after many contracts carried clauses that locked members into long - term deals of up to 24 months and made it difficult to quit			1
those who suffer an injury , fall ill , lose their job or has to move for work reasons can be hit with a cancellation bill equivalent to a full year of payments			0
the new contracts , agreed with the @entity14 , give members extended rights to cancel their contracts early with a small penalty			1
sales staff will also have to spell out more clearly the length of the initial contract period and the cancellation rights			2
the @entity14 is now writing to 20 other fitness operators warning them to ensure membership contracts are fair and clear			1
@entity51 , @entity14 executive director , said : ' as a result of our investigation , millions of eligible gym members now have better contract terms , including improved cancellation rights that prevent them being unfairly locked in if their circumstances change			1
‘ this should be a warning to the rest of the industry that we will not hesitate to take action where we find evidence of consumers being treated unfairly			2
’ getting in shape : the changes follow an @entity14 investigation into the gym industry he added that anyone who is considering joining a gym or health club should read the terms of the contract carefully before signing			1
‘ alarm bells should ring if gyms are not being clear and upfront about their terms and conditions , including the length of the contract and cancellation rights , ’ he said			1
‘ if consumers are told something that is not in the terms and conditions , they should ask for written confirmation			2
' the @entity14 said it would continue to monitor compliance alongside @entity91			1
it launched its investigation after a @entity94 ruling against a gym management company found lengthy membership periods could be unfair when they locked people in without adequate cancellation rights if their circumstances changed			1
@entity100 , chief executive at national charity @entity101 said : ' there is just no excuse for dodgy gyms locking customers into unreasonable contracts			0
we helped with over 3,000 problems with gyms and health clubs over the last year			0
we regularly hear from customers who have been ripped off by deals that have a nasty surprise in the fine print			0
' gyms need to be up front with their customers about what is involved in their membership contracts			0
those gyms that still have n’t done so should follow the example of those giving better cancellation rights or risk a consumer backlash			2
how long is the contract ? carefully consider the length of the contract and whether you are sure you want to sign up for a year or whether a rolling monthly contract or pay - as - you go would be more suitable			2
membership costing £ 50 a month will add up to £ 600 a year			0
can you cancel the contract early if your circumstances change or if you change your mind ? find out if you can cancel the contract if your circumstances change			2
some gym providers allow you to cancel the contract or put it on hold under certain circumstances such as if you are injured and unable to use the facilities or if you lose your job			1
if the salesperson makes verbal promises such as ' you can cancel your membership at any time ' , ask them where this is set out in their terms and conditions or , if it is not , to confirm the point in writing before you sign up			0
ask if the gym has a cooling - off period			0
normally you ca n't cancel if you change your mind or stop using the gym and will have to pay every month until you can cancel at the end of the minimum term.4			0
will the contract be automatically extended after the initial membership period ? most contracts for gym membership automatically continue once the initial membership period has expired			1
make a note of the date by which you should inform them			0
you should ask for some form of proof that the gym has received your cancellation notice			0
for example , if you hand it in at the gym reception desk , get a receipt.5			0
do you have the time to go to the gym and can you afford the monthly payments ? make sure you understand the commitment you are signing up for and that you are sure the contract you have signed up for suits your needs .			1

gym chains promise to be more upfront about the contract terms
