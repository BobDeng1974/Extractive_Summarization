a tribunal held at @entity23 ’ @entity24 yesterday heard evidence from mrs @entity9 , who says her holiday request for the last 10 days of fasting during @entity8 was turned down unfairly			1

however solicitor @entity34 , representing @entity20 , called mrs @entity9 a ' liar ' during cross examination and said that she had not got the holidays she asked for because she missed a deadline - meaning all holiday time was already taken			1
he said : ' you have not got exactly what you wanted and acted like a spoiled brat , and you have taken the easy way out to play the discrimination and race card , have n’t you ? it is unfair			0
' mrs @entity9 rejected accusations that she had fabricated her story , and said that she and her husband had enjoyed their job at the @entity19 base			1
she said : ' no it was not the easy way out			0
' it was very difficult to deal with			0
we asked for the holidays because it was too difficult to work night shifts while fasting			0

directly after , he told @entity34 and mrs @entity9 he had discussed @entity8 with the other person and had decided he would not grant the request , claims mrs @entity9			2

mrs @entity9 said she had come to a compromise to work shorter , seven - hour shifts , and split her 30 - minute breaks in two but the cumulative stress of working while fasting had led to her breakdown			1
