gone are the days when bigger meant better as many stars opted for subtle and sleek hairdos at last night 's @entity3			1
when it comes to award ceremony hair understated appears to be popular , and last night 's locks were classically beautiful , conforming to old world @entity8 glamour			1
the most favoured look appeared to be about keeping hair off the shoulders with @entity13 and @entity14 opting for soft up - dos and @entity16 and @entity17 choosing the trendy @entity18 ( long bob )			1
@entity33 : textured , glamorous pleat @entity33 's effortless pleat is a red carpet classic if a little ' safe ' @entity33 sports a relaxed , textured effortless pleat which complements the simplicity of her beautiful coral dress			2
this season on the red carpet , as well as on the runways , we 've seen an abundance of effortless and un-done styles , so @entity33 's choice is a great combination of on - trend and glamour , making it perfect for the @entity3			1
however , some critics might say she 's played it a little safe , as the style is similar to her low twist chignon from last year 's @entity3			1
@entity54 : natural , soft bun @entity57 ' natural bun worked in favour of her dramatic dress choice she may not have received the best reception for her choice in gown , but her natural soft bun is perfectly in keeping with runway styles for this spring and summer			2
women that are wearing dresses with a high neckline want to embrace effortless , textured hair , as it avoids distracting too much from the dress			2
@entity71 : @entity72 knotted ' un-do ' @entity73 won best hair in @entity28 ' books with her take on the @entity77 up - do @entity71 's look is without a doubt my favourite from this year 's @entity3 red carpet			1
it 's a stunning transition from the overly done @entity77 up - do , which we see far too often on the red carpet , into a more textured , knotted un-do			2
the texture running through the front of the hair keeps the style soft and elegant , allowing the knot at the back to be a little tighter			2
@entity94 : off - balance chignon @entity28 was n't keen on @entity94 's play - it - safe chignon as he says it has been overly set @entity94 's hair is a play - safe chignon that has n't quite gone to plan			1
the style for me is a little off balance to the one side and overly set			0
the look could have been made a little softer and elegant if there was more texture running through the front			0
with the bun positioned towards the nape of the neck			0
unfortunately , for me , her deep blue gown and hair do not work together to create that wow factor we so want from the red carpet			2
@entity17 : on - trend sleek lob @entity17 's @entity18 ( @entity117 ) wins points in the trend stakes this year already we 've seen so many celebrity icons revamping their look from long styles to the on - trend , effortless @entity18 ( @entity117 ) - @entity124 and @entity125 to name a few			1
@entity17 has worn this style straight with a deep side parting , keeping her look sophisticated and stunning , so that her natural beauty and her gorgeous red dress make the statement			0
@entity131 : simply pony @entity131 's simple pony tail was a bit of a let down at her first big awards ceremony wearing a simple ponytail can always be a risk at such a big awards ceremony			0
although it 's a versatile style , and one which is timeless , with so much anticipation about her red carpet arrival , could @entity140 's look have been too simple this year ? opting for a straight pony , this look gives a nod to the @entity148 ' poker - straight trend that we are seeing more and more of			1
i like that she has kept the look delicate and feminine by simply wrapping a thin piece of hair around the elastic - a style which is easy to re-create at home and can be worn as a day look or straight out for dinner			0
@entity14 : effortless low bun this look may look effortless but works well for awards seasons as it keeps the eye focused on the dress a beautiful take a on a red carpet hair style which works well for the awards season , but also follows this seasons trend of a simple hair - up with a twist			1
the deep side parting , effortlessly twisted into a gorgeous low bun at the nape of the neck , complements the high line of @entity14 's white dress			2
@entity13 : classic chignon the chignon is always a favourite on the red carpet and one that is pretty fail safe a great sleek chignon that 's almost as timeless as the ponytail			0
this is a classic hairstyle that will always be red carpet worthy â€“ @entity13 's looks absolutely perfect for the red carpet			0
@entity16 : @entity186 textured lob @entity16 gave the @entity18 an updated textured feel with her beachy waves also embracing the lob , @entity16 's @entity3 style is such a wearable look that we will be seeing a lot more of in the world of film and fashion			1
rather than wearing it sleek like @entity17 , @entity18 has a nonchalant , textured feel to it			0
this look is super easy to re-create at home , using a curling wand on the mid-lengths of the hair , but leaving out the ends for a more lived - in feel			0
@entity205 : twisted un-do @entity205 's un-do is not to try hard but achieves an elegant finish a simple but stunning and effective look			0
@entity210 's beautifully twisted un-do , that 's not overly polished , works perfectly with her @entity212 dress			0
@entity25 : @entity77 chignon the textured @entity77 look is a messier take on the classic red carpet chignon a little too @entity77 with the hair , but still working towards an on - trend , textured chignon , @entity25 is looking incredible as always			2
there is always a high expectation for @entity25 's red carpet look and she does n't really ever get much wrong			0
@entity224 : straight , slicked back @entity28 was n't madly keen on @entity224 's 90s look as he believe it did not flatter the dress although @entity224 is working the natural @entity148 sleek and slicked back look , i do n't feel this style complements her dress			1
a better look would had been a simple low twisted bun or ponytail , so that focus is on the detail of the dress			0
@entity238 : confused hair @entity28 was not impressed with @entity238 's hair as he says it did n't look styled or natural for me @entity238 has got it spot on with the dress , yet her hair does n't seem to know whether it 's supposed to be ' un-done ' or ' done '			1
it 's neither styled nor natural			1
if she had n't gone for such a strong centre parting , but more of a deep side part , it would have given the look a softer and effortless feel which would have worked better for her .			0

the hair trend at the @entity3 appeared to be understated
stars opted for low buns or natural bobs rather than over styled looks
