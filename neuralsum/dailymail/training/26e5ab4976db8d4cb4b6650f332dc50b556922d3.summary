by @entity0 @entity1 has been living with the most devastating mystery for the last eight years			1
the 30 - year - old , from @entity4 , @entity5 , can not move her legs , can not use her arms and can only communicate through slow speech			1
doctors are baffled and have been unable to provide a diagnosis			2
but the most heartbreaking part of @entity1 's battle is that her illness prevents her from showing the simplest maternal instincts to her one and only child			1
@entity1 eight years ago ( left ) before a mysterious illness took over her body			1
doctors have n't been able to diagnose her condition the 30 - year - old is now bedridden and feeds through a tube her mother 's home in @entity4 , south - west of @entity25 it all began prior to @entity1 's pregnancy when she began suffering from an unusually high heart rate and blurred vision , @entity1 's mother and carer @entity26 said			1
' it just came out of the blue and there were n't many signs leading up to it , ' ms @entity1 explained			1
' but then five months into her pregnancy all she saw was fog and could n't see			2
' upon visiting the eye specialist , @entity1 was told this was more than just her vision and was referred to a neurologist			1
there were still no answers and after her daughter @entity46 was born , the condition progressed to her legs			1
' @entity50 's legs were very fatigued so she was constantly leaning on something or someone but she could n't make it very far , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' so i had to be with her all the time and then she had to move back in with me when @entity56 was about three years old			1
' @entity1 is the mother to eight - year - old daughter @entity56 ( right )			1
they are both hopeful that @entity1 will overcome this illness just a day after her 30th birthday , @entity1 was taken to hospital in a critical condition then tremors started in @entity1 's hands			1
' she could n't sit up right , she lost control and just could n't support herself , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' so i would have to hold her up when she went to the toilet and she started using a wheel chair			2
but then we had to get one especially made for her because her chin would drop down			0
' i 'm virtually @entity1 's arms , legs and voice			1
' while @entity1 still has reflexes in her body , she has been completely bedridden for the past year and feeds through a tube as she 's unable to swallow			1
the young mother reached a critical moment on may 31 , just a day after her 30th birthday			0
' she was at the edge of life or death , ' ms @entity1 said			2
@entity1 was taken to hospital as she had been suffering from pneumonia			2
' the doctors just told us there was nothing left for them to do , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' they were telling us to be prepared			0
we even spoke with palliative care			0
' @entity1 's condition has progressively become worse as she is now unable to use her legs , her arms and can only communicate through slow speech @entity1 had to move back in with her mother @entity26 when @entity56 was three - years - old but @entity1 proved them wrong			1
' she 's always been strong and always believed that this is n't permanent , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' we 're just waiting for someone to open the door with an answer			0
' while ms @entity1 is a full - time carer , she tells of a mother 's heartache as she 's seen her second youngest daughter deteriorate each day			1
' the difficulty for me is to watch her deteriorate little by little and lose her independence , ' she said			0
' she was a very good singer , great dancer and she was very social and outgoing			0
she played netball and was very active			0
incredibly contrasting from her life now			0
' even the simple things in life have become part of @entity1 's every day struggle			2
' i have to scratch her head when it 's itchy or if something is in her eye i have to get it out for her , ' ms @entity1 said			2
' but the heartbreaking thing is that she ca n't raise her daughter and she watches life go on			2
it 's difficult to see that she 's losing her place in life			0
' @entity26 ( right ) has been with her daughter every step of the way @entity56 is waiting for the day her mum overcomes her illness and finally gets out of bed @entity1 is determined to overcome her illness so she can become the mother she 's always wanted to be for @entity56 incredibly , @entity1 remains positive despite living with the mysterious illness which has completely taken over her life			1
' the doctors told us they have no answers , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' they just hit a wall			0
' but @entity1 is so good with dealing with it all			2
so she 's my strength			0
' and her motivation is to finally be the mother she 's always wanted to be for eight - year - old daughter @entity56			1
' she 's a beautiful girl and she 's grown up very quickly , ' ms @entity1 said			2
' but she 's just hanging out for the day her mum gets out of bed			0
the saddest thing is that @entity1 ca n’t easily give her own daughter a hug			1
' ms @entity1 says they all truly believe that @entity1 will overcome the illness			2
' @entity1 strongly believes that this is a journey she has to be on because there 's a reason for everything and there 's a purpose for what she 's going through , ' ms @entity1 said			2
' whatever this is , it will just run its course			0
i do n't think @entity1 's condition is terminal			1
' so we are just waiting for a miracle			0
' ‘ it ’s often assumed that with our increased understanding of medicine and progress with genome sequencing , a diagnosis will simply pop up , ' @entity164 , director of @entity165 told @entity172			0
the charity , along with its sub-section called @entity175 without a name - offers support and information to families of children with undiagnosed conditions			0
mr @entity181 added : ' however it is surprisingly difficult in many cases to make a diagnosis – we estimate that in the @entity186 alone , there are at least 5,000 families who have a child with an undiagnosed condition			0
‘ it can be incredibly frustrating and stressful – these people often have a cocktail of difficult problems and their lives are hanging by a thread			0
they have also been through countless tests which often conclude there are ‘ no abnormalities ’			0
‘ that does n’t mean there ’s nothing wrong – it means we do n’t understand the significance of these results			0
sometimes you get a lot of data but not a huge amount of information			0
for a diagnosis , you need a previous example to compare it with			0
without that , how do you know it ’s the same thing ? ‘ rare diseases - often caused by extremely rare genetic mutation - are defined as medical conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 people ( this is the number the @entity218 uses )			0
the @entity219 in the @entity220 has recently established the @entity221 ( @entity221 ) to help diagnose rare and new diseases and treat those with rare disorders			0
dr @entity225 , director of the @entity226 , told @entity227 : ‘ to date , researchers have discovered the genomic bases of more than 5,000 rare genetic disorders , but we are still on the hunt for the cause of an additional 2,000 - 3,000 single - gene , also called @entity235 , disorders			2

doctors have told @entity1 that they have no answers for her
it started prior to her pregnancy eight years ago when she began getting high heart rates and blurred vision
after the birth of daughter @entity56 , @entity1 has n't been able to use her legs
she also suffers from tremors in her hands , *chronic* pain in both arms and slow speech
the 30 - year - old is now bedridden and completely *reliant* on her mother @entity256
