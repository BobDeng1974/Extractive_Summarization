in the video posted on @entity12 , he stops his car and puts it in reverse , but is so enthralled by the pair that he does n't notice the metal post behind him			2
second look : a motorist hits the brakes after noticing the scantily - clad women as they crossed the street the video begins with the women , at opposite ends of a zebra crossing , walking toward each other on a street in the @entity28 city of @entity29 , also known as @entity30			1

without paying any attention to his surroundings , the man backs right into a lamppost with a huge thud			0
as the post rattles back and forth , he quickly becomes the laughing stock of the neighbourhood as the women and people off camera erupt in laughter and applause			1
