by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 16 january 2013 a passing doctor who overheard grief - stricken parents preparing to say goodbye to their dying son saved the baby 's life with a scalpel and a pair of disposable rubber gloves			1
devastated @entity9 and @entity10 were told their month - old son @entity11 was about to die from an infection after his small intestine burst			1
but a doctor attending another baby on the ward came over and offered to carry out an impromput stomach operation - before warning them : ' i 've never done this before '			1
do you know the identity of the mystery doctor who saved @entity11 's life ? if so , please call @entity26 020 3615 1877 so grateful : @entity10 , @entity9 , and their son @entity11 , who is now 16 months old and thriving he told @entity11 's distraught father : ' i 'm going to try something on your son - it will either save his life or end things			1
' @entity37 mr @entity10 , 30 , had no time to hesitate and agreed the doctor should try			0
the surgeon calmly reached into @entity11 's incubator , made two tiny cuts in his stomach with a scalpel , and drained the infection , using a glove in each incision to keep the wounds open			1
@entity48 , 28 , who had fled from her baby 's bedside in tears , returned to the ward to see a 2p blue surgical glove in each incision , letting the infection drain out out of her son 's body			1
before the life - saving surgery @entity11 had been too ill to be transferred from @entity59 in @entity60 to @entity61 for specialist treatment			1
but the ' miracle ' procedure saved him and left him well enough to move to @entity65 , @entity61 where he underwent a six - hour - long operation			1
little fighter : @entity68 has overcome a catalogue of health problems @entity11 , who is now 16 months old , has made a full recovery and only has to return to hospital for check ups			1
and remarkably , his parents still have no idea who the man who saved their baby 's life was			2
they believe the doctor is a heart surgeon at @entity61 's @entity82 , and was visiting heart patients in @entity60 at the time			0
@entity48 , a dental nurse , from @entity85 , @entity60 , said : ' the nurse called us into a room and she said " @entity11 is not going to survive "			2
tiny : @entity11 weighed only 2lb 4oz when he was born in september 2011 on the road to recovery : @entity11 's father is now planning to raise funds for the charity that helped the family ' she said we should ask our family to come up to the hospital to say goodbye to @entity11 and she said she could call the priest for us			1
' the nurses were crying too as they had been trying to save @entity11			2
i was so upset i ran out of the room crying and threw up			0
' then @entity10 came and found me and told me what the doctor had said			0
' the doctor had pulled @entity10 aside and said : " i 'm going to try something on your son , it will either save his life or end things there and then			0
" ' the doctor said he had never done the procedure before , but @entity10 told him to try			0
' i did not know what to think when i returned to see @entity11 with two plastic gloves sticking out of his tummy			1
' but i was amazed that it had worked			0
i am so grateful for that doctor for saving @entity11 's life			1
' @entity11 is an absolute miracle			2
he 's a really happy boy and now he eats everything and is putting on weight			0
' @entity11 's life was saved with rubber gloves after his father @entity10 , left , agreed to let a mystery doctor try growing toddler : @entity11 was discharged from hospital last march and doctors say he will make a full recovery @entity11 was born two months premature and weighing just 2lb 4oz after an emergency caesarean in september 2011			1
he started gaining weight but at three weeks his stomach started to swell			0
doctors at @entity59 told @entity11 's parents he had a condition affecting some premature infants called @entity138 where the small intestine tissue becomes inflamed and dies			1
they watched helplessly as his stomach got larger and larger and turned a grey - black colour			0
on october 20 they were summoned to the hospital at 5am and told by a consultant that @entity11 had got 95 per cent worse in 24 hours			2
his small intestine had burst inside him and they were told to call in other relatives to say goodbye as he was unlikely to survive			0
@entity11 's only hope was to be transferred to @entity65 in @entity61 for an emergency operation but doctors said he was too weak to survive the journey			2
the good @entity152 doctor was treating a baby girl with a heart condition on the same ward when he overheard the grief - stricken parents			1
at @entity65 surgeons removed 70cm of @entity11 's intestine			2
he stayed in intensive care for next seven months and battled through a catalogue of complications including 17 blood transfusions and several resuscitations			0
the baby also contracted @entity172 , developed liver failure , enlarged ventricles on the brain , a small hole in his heart , and an infection next to his heart , but still pulled through			0
he was finally discharged from hospital in march last year and doctors believe he will make a full recovery			0
