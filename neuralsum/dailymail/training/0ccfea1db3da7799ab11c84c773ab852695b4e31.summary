by @entity0 published : 10:01 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 01:59 est , 5 october 2012 pet owners have been warned next time they have the flu , they may not just pass it on to friends and family - they might also infect their animals			1
thankfully , the chances are relatively slim , but @entity11 researchers said greater awareness was needed of the phenomenon , known as ' reverse zoonosis			1
' they added that people who experienced an influenza - like virus , should distance themselves from their animals			2
around 80 to 100million households have a cat or dog in the @entity11 , with 20million domestic felines and pooches in the @entity24			1
is your pet poorly ? the first recorded , probable case of fatal human - to - cat transmission of h1n1 flu occurred in @entity30 in 2009 it ’s well known that new strains of influenza can evolve from animal populations such as pigs and birds and ultimately move into human populations , including the most recent influenza pandemic strain , @entity38			1
it ’s less appreciated , experts say , that humans appear to have passed the @entity38 flu to cats and other animals , some of which have died of respiratory illness			1
professor @entity48 , from @entity49 , who is looking into the phenomenon , said : ' we worry a lot about zoonoses , the transmission of diseases from animals to people			2
' but most people do n’t realize that humans can also pass diseases to animals , and this raises questions and concerns about mutations , new viral forms and evolving diseases that may potentially be zoonotic			0
' and , of course , there is concern about the health of the animals			0
' so far there are only a handful of known cases of people spreading flu to their animals but this could be due to poor awareness of the phenomenon			1
researchers at @entity49 and @entity82 are now working to find more cases of this type of disease transmission to better understand the risks to people and their pets			2
they said people with influenza - like illnesses should distance themselves from their pets			0
if a pet experiences respiratory disease or other illness following household exposure to someone with flu , they should take them to the vet for tests			0
the first recorded , probable case of fatal human - to - cat transmission of the pandemic h1n1 flu virus occurred in @entity30 in 2009 , @entity48 said			2
details were published in @entity104 , a professional journal			0
in that instance , a pet owner became severely ill with the flu and had to be hospitalized			0
while she was still in the hospital , her cat - an indoor cat with no exposure to other sick people , homes or wildlife - also died of pneumonia caused by an @entity38 infection			1
since then , researchers have identified a total of 13 cats and one dog with pandemic @entity38 infection in 2011 and 2012 that appeared to have come from humans			1
pet ferrets have also been shown to be infected , and some died			0
all of the animals ’ symptoms were similar to that of humans - they rapidly develop severe respiratory disease , stop eating and some die			0
serological studies suggest there is far more exposure to flu virus in cats and dogs than previously known			1
' it ’s reasonable to assume there are many more cases of this than we know about , and we want to learn more , ' prof @entity48 said			0
' any time you have infection of a virus into a new species , it ’s a concern , a black box of uncertainty			2
we do n’t know for sure what the implications might be , but we do think this deserves more attention			0
' natural and experimental transmission of the @entity156 influenza virus from dogs to cats in @entity159 showed the potential for flu viruses to be transmitted among various animal species , prof @entity48 said			1
it ’s unknown if an infected cat or other pet could pass influenza back to humans			0
the primary concern in ' reverse zoonosis , ' is that in any new movement of a virus from one species to another , the virus might mutate into a more virulent , harmful or easily transmissible form .			2

a total of 13 cats and one dog in the @entity11 are believed to have caught the @entity38 virus in 2011 and 2012 from their owners
researchers say there needs to be greater awareness of the phenomenon
