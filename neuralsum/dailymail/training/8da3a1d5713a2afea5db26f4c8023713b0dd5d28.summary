after squishy leaves , falling trees , and the wrong kind of snow , rail bosses are facing a bizarre new hazard caused by the 70mph winds battering @entity7 – trampolines on the line			1
the growing popularity of trampolines in family back gardens is posing a real problem for services when there is a severe gale			2
and the current stormy weather has put them on alert			2
@entity20 said it had cleared five trampolines from lines in @entity23 over the weekend amid garden debris and 400 fallen trees on the tracks			1
@entity27 which operates the main @entity29 line between @entity30 and @entity23 said it encounters a handful of such cases a year in high winds			1
the company urges people to tie their trampolines down so they do n't blow away and they are bracing themselves for more as the bad weather moves south into @entity38			1
@entity27 which operates the main @entity29 line between @entity30 and @entity23 said it encounters a handful of such cases a year in high winds , and they are not alone			1
@entity20 admitted : ‘ it can be a serious problem			1
’ ‘ we ’d urge people to tie your trampolines down ’ as a precaution			2
that goes for any other loose garden materials too ,			0
’ garden trampolines can vary in size from mini bouncers to quite substantial though usually lightweight aluminium structures with side safety netting			2
but they can catch like a sail in the wind and fly over fences and hedges			1
a @entity27 spokesman said : ‘ i ’d hate it to be characterised as trampolines on the line			2
but we do have cases of those small trampolines being caught by a gust of wind , blown out of gardens and onto the track			1
' you just have to go on @entity74 or look out of a train window and you can see how many of them there are in the nation ’s back gardens			0
we might get two or three such incidents a year if there ’s a high wind			0
someone has to remove them so it causes delays			0
’ @entity20 said it had cleared five trampolines from lines in @entity23 over the weekend amid garden debris and 400 fallen trees on the tracks after storms in january 2012 the @entity92 reported : ‘ some rail services have been disrupted owing to incredibly strong wind and localised flooding overnight and this morning			1
' hundreds of fallen trees and debris including ripped off roofs and children ’s trampolines have been removed from tracks			1
’ in december 2013 weary travellers on the 7am @entity105 service from @entity107 queen street station found their journey halted after five minutes because of a trampoline that had blown on to the line became stuck			0
it coincided with severe wind and rain that affected services as trains ran at half speed before being suspended			1
the driver told passengers : ‘ we ’ve stopped because we ’ve collided with a trampoline			0
’ the website rail.co.uk notes : ‘ high winds bring their own problems such as debris from gardens blowing onto the track			0
it is not unknown for ripped off roofs , garden sheds and children ’s trampolines to land on the lines or overhead wires			2
’ in @entity136 in december 2013 a trampoline caught by the winds caused damage to overhead rail lines near @entity139 in @entity140			0
another trampoline blown on to a rail track was struck by the 7.10am @entity143 to @entity140 train at @entity145			0
a @entity27 spokesman said : ‘ leaves on the line is a well - known problem			0
the issue is not the leaf but the concentration of leaf mulsh which makes the track slippery			0
' there are machines which spray the track to retain traction			0
sand can also be used to improve grip , it ’s less of a problem than it was			0
’ @entity20 have been doing a good job clearing trees from the side of the track to reduce the risk of them being blown over onto the line			1
sometimes they have to negotiate with private land owners who may or may not agree , some demand heavy payments			0
’ a spokesman for @entity27 which runs the @entity29 mainline and has won the contract to run the @entity179 line from next year said : ‘ heavy winds are a real problem for the railways and it is often the case that household items are blown from people ’s gardens onto the tracks and overhead lines			2
‘ last year we experienced 4 or 5 incidents of trampolines being blown onto the track			0
large items like this pose a particular issue as , even if they do n’t bring down the lines , the power will still have to be switched off before they can be removed from the track			2
’ @entity20 said : ‘ strong winds bring challenges for the railway as they can blow debris , branches and trees from the trackside and neighbouring land onto the track , increasing the risk of a derailment			1
‘ unsecured items such as garden furniture and trampolines have in the past been particularly problematic and so we would urge people living next to the railway to secure all items on their property to reduce the risk of them blowing onto the tracks , causing potential damage to trains and delays to the travelling public			1

debris , branches and trees found on tracks can cause trains to derail
trampolines can catch like a sail in the wind and fly over fences
@entity20 cleared five trampolines from lines in @entity23 over the weekend
with bad weather moving into @entity38 , @entity20 fears trampolines will be more of an issue
