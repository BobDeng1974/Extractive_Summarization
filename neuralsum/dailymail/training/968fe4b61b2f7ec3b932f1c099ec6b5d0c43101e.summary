drivers are being driven around the bend by wonky white lines painted along the centre of a busy road			1
but astonishingly bosses at @entity6 insist the road markings in @entity8 , @entity9			1
were painted deliberately wonky - as a safety measure to slow down traffic			1
@entity12 , a community carer , was perplexed when she spotted the wobbly lines while driving through the @entity16 area of the town			0
@entity18 , construction manager for @entity6 's highways department , insisted the wobbly lines were quite deliberate council road chiefs insist the lines are deliberate , forming part of a bizarre measure aimed at slowing down traffic in a notorious rat run she said : ' it just struck me as really funny when i saw the lines			1
the road is a bit of a rat run anyway , particularly in the mornings , and there is always people driving along it , so i think there 's going to be quite a lot of confusion			0
' i ca n't logically explain how this has happened			0
it just makes the road narrower on the other side			0
' rather than the normal straight white lines running down the centre of the road , drivers are facing weird winding markings that wiggle down the carriageway the measures are aimed at slowing down traffic in a notorious rat run by forcing drivers to follow a curving course @entity8 resident @entity55 , 10 , does n't know what to make of the bizarre new markings outside her home driver @entity59 , 28 , said : ' i thought the person who painted them must have been drunk			1
' if you stand at one end of the road and look down it the straight line in the middle goes off all over the place			0
' if it is part of a traffic calming scheme then it has left me baffled			1
' but road chiefs insist they are deliberate , forming part of a bizarre measure aimed at slowing down traffic in a notorious rat run by forcing drivers to follow a curving course			2
but @entity18 , construction manager for @entity6 's highways department , insisted the wobbly lines were quite deliberate			2
he said : ' this road has recently been resurfaced as part of the defects programme			0
' these markings were installed as part of a traffic engineering scheme			2
' our team have had a number of residents thank them as it helps to slow down traffic in a road that was previously considered a rat run			2
' @entity94 asked @entity6 to provide figures to support the scheme 's safety credentials but had not received any at the time of publication .			0

the bends were painted in white lines on a busy road in @entity8 , @entity9
@entity6 insists the markings are deliberately wonky to slow down cars and claim they have been *praised* by local residents
but one driver described the traffic calming idea as ' ludicrous '
