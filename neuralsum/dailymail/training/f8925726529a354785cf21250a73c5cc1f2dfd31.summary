@entity0 , pictured , said it was ' dangerous and wrong ' to blame unemployment on immigration accusing @entity4 and @entity5 of ' pandering to unpleasant prejudice ' @entity0 was accused of ‘ mind - boggling arrogance ’ last night after claiming mass immigration made no difference to the job prospects of unemployed @entity12			1
the former prime minister launched a scathing attack on @entity4 and @entity5 , saying politicians hostile to immigration were guilty of pandering to unpleasant prejudice			1
they were also guilty of deceiving the public by giving the impression that the arrival of migrants from @entity22 and other countries harmed their job prospects			2
the truth , he said , was that the ‘ white , working - class , unemployed youth in alienated communities in @entity12 ’ were held back by their own lack of education and skills			1
in what many critics see as further proof that mr @entity0 is positioning himself for a bid to become president of the @entity39 , he told an audience of business chiefs in @entity42 that it was ‘ dangerous and wrong ’ to blame immigrants for unemployment among @entity12 workers			1
he said it was ‘ a deception to tell people they ’re better off shutting down in the face of [ global change ] or stigmatising those different in race , colour , religion or faith ’			2
‘ the answer to the white , working - class , unemployed youth in alienated communities in @entity12 is not to tell them their problems would be solved if there were fewer @entity22 people working in the @entity12			1
it is to provide them with the education and the skills and the connectivity that gives them the ability to face the world ’s challenges and overcome them			1
‘ anything else is worse than a delusion – it actually holds them back by giving them a grievance rather than a chance			2
it is dangerous and wrong for leaders in @entity12 politics to think you are going to address the concerns of people worried about jobs , their future , how they get some hope and opportunity – to play into an idea that what ’s holding them back is someone else coming in and taking their opportunity from them , because it is n’t true and it ’s not helpful			1
’ he added : ‘ if you look at what ’s going to make this country great in the future it is to use the connections that @entity12 has – its language , its position in the world , its history			0
if we do that , we ’re going to be highly successful as a country			0
we ’re never going to do it by an attitude that says we do n’t like foreigners			0
‘ you have got to distinguish between the justifiable concerns and the desire for order and what is , in the end , a prejudice that is neither very pleasant nor very fruitful			2
’ mr @entity0 is widely seen as having thrown open the gates to mass immigration as prime minister			1
in the mid- 1990s , net migration was consistently around 50,000 a year			0
but during the 2000s it regularly topped 200,000			0
conservative mp @entity125 accused mr @entity0 of ' mind - boggling arrogance ' claiming life looks very different from a ' gilded square ' in central @entity42 compared with a small cottage in @entity131 @entity125 , the @entity132 mp for @entity133 , said the @entity137 ’s ‘ mind - boggling arrogance ’ beggared belief			1
he added : ‘ if you look at the world from an expensive property in a gilded square in @entity42 , then immigration looks very different to if you are in a small bungalow in my part of @entity131			0
‘ immigration might have been a good thing for overpaid over-opinionated former pms because it means we have got more @entity151 plutocrats and @entity153 sheiks to rub shoulders with			0
but in my constituency immigration can mean being priced out of work			0
’ an official report in 2012 by the independent @entity158 found that for every 100 extra foreign - born , working - age migrants in the @entity12 , there was a reduction of 23 in the number of @entity12 in employment			0
mr @entity0 ’s speech to the @entity165 accused those who advocate pulling out of the @entity167 of ‘ traducing ’ the national interest			1
their arguments , under what he said was the ‘ false banner of independence ’ , would leave @entity12 dependent on other global powers it would be unable to influence			0
it would also mean @entity12 stepping down from the ‘ principal stage of the world ’			0
despite mr @entity0 ’s insistence he was not in line for the @entity39 job , there was speculation last night that he could become a compromise candidate if no deal is done by later this year .			2

@entity0 attacked @entity5 claiming they were pandering to prejudice
