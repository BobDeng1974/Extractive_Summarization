seconds from crashing : sir @entity0 and wife @entity1 the pilot of a helicopter carrying sir @entity4 and his wife @entity1 missed two urgent warnings that he was seconds from crashing			0
the aircraft then avoided hitting treetops near the couple ’s @entity11 home by just 2ft , according to an investigation into the incident			1
the pilot , who had become ‘ spatially disorientated ’ , dramatically swung the chartered @entity16 to safety with seconds to spare			1
his co-pilot was so convinced they were going to crash that he ‘ momentarily ’ lost the ability to speak during the drama			1
sir @entity0 , 72 , and his 53 - year - old wife , @entity22 , were returning from @entity23 after they had attended the launch of a vegetarian cookbook written by sir @entity0 ’s eldest daughter @entity27 in may 2012 , as revealed at the time by @entity29			0
in treacherous weather , the pilot was attempting a night landing on a helipad encircled by woodland			1
a full investigation carried out by the @entity37 ’s @entity36 ( @entity36 ) found that neither pilot heard two audio warnings			2
the first said ‘ @entity45 ’ , meaning they were 30 seconds from either the ground or an obstacle , in this case the treetops			2
the second message , ‘ @entity47 ’ , was issued when they were 20 seconds away			0
both alerts also flashed on the controls			0
but despite the ‘ warnings that the helicopter was approaching the ground , the flight crew were not aware of these warnings ’ , said the @entity36 report , which also revealed the terror in the cockpit before the second of two aborted landings			0
as they approached the helipad , the pilot ‘ switched the landing lights on , but the glare from the falling rain in front of the helicopter prompted him to switch them off again ’			1
the co-pilot later recalled telling the pilot that , at this point , they were below the ‘ safety altitude without sufficient visual references ’			1
they pressed on ‘ even though he believed that the commander ’s actions were flawed ’			2
eventually the pilot decided it was unsafe to land and tried another approach			0
pictured , an @entity91 helicopter the report said : ‘ the co-pilot , who was monitoring the instruments , saw that the helicopter was descending and began to speak to highlight this to the commander			2
’ seconds later he saw the altimeter ‘ winding down towards zero extremely quickly ’ and then found himself ‘ momentarily unable to continue speaking , expecting the helicopter to crash ’			1
but the pilot , ‘ recognising that the helicopter was approaching the treetops , began an aggressive go - around , flaring the helicopter and increasing power ’			1
the pilot eventually landed safely after diverting to @entity106 in @entity107 , 15 miles from the @entity4 home near @entity109			0
the £ 5 million nine - seater helicopter was chartered from @entity91 , which charges about £ 3,000 an hour and describes itself as the ‘ leading @entity23 - based business aviation service provider ’			2
a spokesman for the firm said last night that it co-operated fully with the investigation			0
sir @entity0 ’s spokesman declined to comment			0
