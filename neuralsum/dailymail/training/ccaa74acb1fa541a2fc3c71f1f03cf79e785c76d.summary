rebuilding an icon is no easy task , especially one so revered as @entity2			1
@entity4 - daughter of @entity6 author @entity5 - talks us through the process and why organisations such as @entity10 are vital in getting more women involved in gaming.1			1
what made you want to work on the @entity15 game ? @entity4 : it 's @entity2 ! how could i not ? after working on a couple of female protagonists in the past ( faith in @entity22 and @entity24 / @entity23 in @entity25 ) it seemed like the perfect next step			1
the fact that the game was a reboot , and i would get to stamp a little bit of myself onto the new @entity2 was also very enticing			1
reimagining a 16 year - old gaming icon like @entity2 really is a once in a lifetime challenge			1
with the industry evolving , how have demands on writers changed over the years ? @entity4 : when i first got into the industry 15 years ago as a games journalist , no one was really talking about games writing			1
it was still being done behind the scenes , but it was n't getting much focus or attention , either from the press or developers / publishers themselves			0
call for action : @entity4 wants to see more female faces in games and the industry as a whole nor was the industry really embracing professional writers as standard			1
in the years that followed the industry did start to remedy this and get more experienced writers onboard			1
unfortunately , it was often very late in the development process , when all they could be was something akin to a narrative paramedic			0
these days it 's got better , but the industry is still trying to work out how to incorporate writers and narrative designers into the development process and establish the best working practices			1
however , this is a two - way street and therefore more writers need to learn about the unique challenges and limitations that exist in writing for games			2
they also need to really understand the benefits of utilising the entirety of a game to express the narrative , not just traditional cinematic methods			2
what is your favourite thing about @entity2 ? does the industry need more female stars ? @entity4 : i like the fact that alongside the bad - a * * ery , she 's an intelligent , archaeology nerd with a real understanding how our history shapes us			1
yes , the industry does need more female protagonists , but it is also in dire need of more protagonists who fall outside the whitey - mcstubbly format			1
the industry has become far too reliant on male , white , straight , mid- 20s , gravelly voiced , short hair and stubble covered heroes			1
we need to develop much greater diversity across the board when it comes to gender , ethnicity , age , sexual orientation and ability			0
what inspired you when writing @entity15 ? @entity4 : researching the period and the mythology we draw upon was fascinating			0
we also looked towards real world tales of survival ( such as @entity120 's story and the @entity122 survivors ) for inspiration			0
this really is a story about the enduring nature of the human spirit and will to survive			0
any games you ’ve been signed up to work on in the future ? @entity4 : yes			0
but nothing i can talk about yet			0
sorry ! at what time does your writing come in at the time of game development ? @entity4 : this really depends on what kind of game is being developed , how important narrative is to the experience and whether the team behind it are used to working with writers			2
writers are not normally involved at the start of the process ( which is generally focused on design and gameplay mechanics ) but come in later to work on story structure , character development and script			0
built from the ground up : @entity2 is still recognisable however there have been some drastic changes in both her appearance and personality this can be anywhere from one to two years into a three to four year production cycle			1
ideally writers and narrative designers should be included much earlier in the process , where they can be of most benefit			0
however , although the industry is slowly getting used to fitting narrative professionals into games development , we ’re still going through a bit of a ‘ square - peg in a round hole ’ phase			1
what was the hardest aspect of re-writing a character as popular as @entity2 and did you consult with fans at all ? @entity4 : i did n’t come into the process until about a year into development , so i ’m not sure what happened in the early stages			1
however , i know that @entity183 did feel obligated to innovate and refresh the franchise for their fans , and not just repeat what had been done before			0
certainly depicting @entity2 at a time when she did n’t have the guns , gadgets and knowhow to easily get herself out of every situation , was quite risky			1
fans are n’t used to seeing @entity2 like that			1
in fact we ’re not used to seeing any videogames character express sentiments like fear , uncertainty or remorse			0
however , when you ’re dealing with a character ’s origin story , you need to show where they ’ve came from and not just where they finished up			0
we wanted players to experience that evolution for themselves			2
were you a massive fan of the early games yourself ? @entity4 : i played and enjoyed the first game and a little of the second			2
the launch of @entity216 was actually my first experience of the games industry			2
but somewhere down the line i lost interest in the franchise			0
i felt that the sex - symbol nature of @entity2 became overplayed by the wider media and that had somewhat obscured the games themselves			1
what influence did your @entity227 have on your love of gaming ? @entity4 : @entity227 really kick - started it			2
he was always into electronics , computers and robotics and introduced me to my first game - @entity236 on the @entity238			1
i was hooked ! we would often play games together – he would play the game and i would sit beside him , with a pencil and graph paper , drawing the maps and guiding him			2
is there a part of the game you are particularly proud of ? @entity4 : i ’m glad that we got to show a different side of a character that everyone thought they knew			2
one of the things that i love about the game , which has absolutely nothing to do with me , is the concept art , including the box art for the game – it ’s beautiful , but not sexualised , strong , but also characterful			2
it really typifies the direction we ’re taking @entity2			1
alone and stranded : @entity15 explores @entity2 's origins and has received wide - spread critical acclaim 6			1
how is @entity10 helping girls be inspired to have a career in games design ? @entity4 : a lot of young girls do n't realise how diverse the career opportunities are in games development			2
many think that you need elite math skills and a vast knowledge of all things tech to work in games , and have n't thought about avenues like design , producing , art , writing or composing			0
initiatives such as the ones started by @entity10 are essential for getting young girls engaged and excited about games design , narrative design and coding			0
giving them hands - on experiences with level editors and watching them create and build levels for themselves is very rewarding			0
suddenly they 've discovered a whole new world that 's out there for the taking			0
it 's empowering for them			0
@entity10 wants to inspire the next generation of young girls to become tech pioneers and to cause nationwide change from the ground up			0
