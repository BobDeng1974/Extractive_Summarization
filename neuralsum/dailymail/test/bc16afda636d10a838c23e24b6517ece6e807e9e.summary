@entity0 has hailed @entity1 as one of the best @entity4 coaches in the country , but insists he does n’t need to take any tactical tips from the experienced relegation dodger			1
@entity0 ’s @entity8 , who face @entity11 ’s @entity10 at the @entity12 on saturday , are 19th in the @entity15 ’s @entity14 table – four points adrift of @entity17 in 17th			1
the @entity18 ’s have taken just four points since the turn of the year and could do with a season climax reminiscent of @entity1 ’s 2013 - 14 campaign with @entity22 , in which they took 17 points from their final eight games to avoid the drop			2
@entity0 praised @entity1 ahead of his sides crucial clash with @entity10 in the @entity14 indeed , @entity1 was linked with the vacant @entity8 managerial post after @entity31 ’s departure in february , but many of the @entity33 faithful turned their noses up at his perceived long - ball tactics			1
‘ i think @entity1 would be a good fit anywhere because he is a quality coach , ’ @entity0 said when asked about the speculation			1
‘ he maximises what he does with his players so he would be a good fit anywhere			0
not just here , at any club			0
‘ i think @entity1 gets a very bad reputation for the way he plays			2
what he does is he goes into places , assesses what the players need and gets the best out of them			0
i would say he is one of the top @entity4 coaches in the country			2
’ @entity0 claims @entity55 ' is one of the best coaches in @entity4 , ' but says that he wo n't be asking for his advice while @entity0 admits he is encouraged by the likes of @entity1 , he firmly believes his own tactical acumen is the reason he was entrusted with keeping @entity8 in the top flight			1
‘ i take inspiration from @entity1 because i respect him as a man and as a coach and as a manager , ’ @entity0 continued			1
‘ i ’ll take any advice from any coach in any league , because i realise how tough the job is			2
‘ as far as tactics are concerned , i do n’t think i ’d be looking at anybody else and asking for any advice			0
i ’ve been put in the job for a reason , the reason being that the people who ’ve put me in think i know what i ’m doing			0
‘ apart from a dodgy 20 minutes at @entity22 , i think we ’ve been in every game , especially against the top teams			0
we were extremely disappointed we did n’t get anything against @entity82			0
but ultimately it ’s about the money ends of the ground , is n’t it ? and we have n’t been good enough at both ends when it really counted			0
’ the @entity8 boss knows that his side ca n't afford to slip up anymore if they want to stay up			1
