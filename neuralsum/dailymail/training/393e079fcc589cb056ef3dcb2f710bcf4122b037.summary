other departments , including the @entity138 , the @entity139 , and even the @entity140 , were also caught off - guard			1
that could spell trouble for @entity143 , who may be subject to federal charges if sensitive information appears in the book			1
lt col @entity115 said that since he is now a private citizen , the military could refer the investigation to the @entity149			0
@entity40 's open letter to the active - duty special operations community said books and films about special operations teams could be useful educational tools , and the military would work with potential authors , but current and former service members would be held accountable if they endangered the safety of @entity28 forces			0
he said there was ' a distinct line between recounting a story for the purposes of education or entertainment and telling a story that exposes sensitive activities just to garner greater readership and personal profit			0

on wednesday , the publisher said the book had been vetted ' for tactical , technical , and procedural information as well as information that could be considered classified by compilation ' by a former ' special operations attorney			1
' @entity228 , a cyber security expert , said @entity18 officials were adept at using the internet for recruitment , training and other searches , and he fully expected them to target the former @entity171 now that his identity had been disclosed			1
