an @entity1 teenager has joined the puffy pout craze by using a shot glass to pump up her lips to ridiculous proportions			1
@entity6 , who lives near @entity7 and already has naturally beautiful voluptuous lips , has joined the # kyliejennerchallenge sweeping social media of placing the opening of any narrow vessel over their mouth and sucking in until the vacuum of air causes their lips to excessively swell			1
in an attempt to emulate @entity20 's bee - stung pout , @entity6 got the shock of her life when she removed the shot glass and suddenly had such protruding lips that social media users compared her to a duck			1
when she first saw the bizarre result , which is reportedly painful with the effect lasting up to hours , she gasped and put her hand to her mouth in disbelief of the strange look and began giggling			2
@entity6 then took her her hand away and exclaimed ' @entity54 ! i ca n't even close my mouth ' and then puts her hand over her mouth again while still laughing			0
she freaked herself out even further when after applying bright red lipstick which created a clown effect			0
the teen then began to pout and then reacted in a repulsed fashion saying ' ewwwwww ' while touching her massive lips			2
despite being quite alarmed by what she had created , @entity6 seems to be impressed at the same time - wondering whether she could get the same effect to plump up her butt			0
' look how big it is - maybe i could do this to my a * * * ! ' then screws up her face and exclaims ' ewwwwww ' yet again			0
@entity6 freaked herself out with the bizarre look that is said to be painful and last hours despite being quite alarmed , @entity6 wonders whether she could get the same effect to plump up her butt @entity6 shows off her already naturally beautiful voluptuous lips before pulling the crazy stunt countless teens , both boys and girls , have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on @entity77 and @entity78 , which in many cases has led to severe bruising around the mouth			2
surprisingly , given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat , it appears the results are far from desirable			2
' i screwed up , ' wrote one teenage girl along with her # kyliejennerchallenge selfie , while another complained she looked ' gross '			1
a worrying new trend dubbed the ' # kyliejennerchallenge ' is sweeping social media , encouraging teens to blow their lips up to epic proportions using bottles or shot glasses ( pictured ) ' made my chin look like a hickey a week ago and i 'll say i 've never felt so dumb , ' one disgruntled teen admitted			1
' i did the # kyliejennerchallenge and my lips turned purple , ' claimed yet another			1
the method - one this journalist wo n't be road - testing - works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar , which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell			1
problematically , the results are said to last for hours , even days , with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after - effects for a lot longer than expected			0
the reportedly painful method involves participants placing their mouth over the opening of a cup , jar or shot glass and sucking in until the air vacuum causes their lips to swell up countless teens , both boys and girls , have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on @entity77 and @entity78 surprisingly , given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat , it appears the results are far from desirable plenty of @entity77 users have been quick to ridicule the craze			1
' stop with that @entity20 challenge it 's so gross , ' one wrote			1
' i hate our generation			0
like you guys are really sticking your lips in small cups , ' another ranted			2
' do people not realise they 're bursting blood vessels ? ' another pointed out			0
the method works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar , which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell problematically , the results are said to last for hours , even days , with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after - effects for much longer than expected last month , two @entity166 sisters attempted the trick by sucking into a hairspray lid , and warned others against it after the stunt went disastrously wrong			1
@entity172 , 18 , and her sister , @entity174 , from @entity175 , were left with swollen and blue bruised lips			2
writing on @entity178 , @entity177 said : ' i wanted to warn people against do - it - yourself lip expansion , but was really surprised and shocked that it ended up being something that loads of people were copying			0
' i just wanted to try it and see what they would look like , i 've never done it before , and i wo n't be doing it again			0
it was very , very painful			0
' one boy expertly demonstrates just how extreme the effects can be if you try hard enough sore - looking red marks are visible around the lip line of this dejected experimenter as for @entity20 herself , the 17 - year - old @entity200 clan member has recently denied artificially enhancing her lips , despite much speculation to the contrary			1
' i have n't had plastic surgery , ' she told @entity206			0
' i 've never been under the knife			0
people flashback to pictures of me when i was 12 and say " @entity20 's so different " but how can i look the same from 12 -18 ? ' plenty of @entity77 users have been quick to ridicule the craze , labelling it ' dumb ' and ' gross ' ' i screwed up , ' wrote one teenage girl along with her # kyliejennerchallenge selfie , while another complained she looked ' gross ' we can only hope this particular trend dies out as fast as it gained steam			1
