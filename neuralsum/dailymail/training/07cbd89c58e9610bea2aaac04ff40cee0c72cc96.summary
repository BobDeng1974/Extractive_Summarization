to the amazement of scientists , some of the meat - eating @entity6 's razor - sharp teeth were found lodged in the @entity7 ' skull			1

a theory proposed last year suggested that the @entity6 used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off @entity7 after killing the huge armoured @entity64 into @entity7 fossils from the @entity66 shows that the @entity68 apex predator first slew its prey , then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient - rich neck meat hidden by body armour			1
they have been so well preserved that some of the bones are still covered in soft tissue			2
the fossil was accidently discovered by a ranch owner in @entity80 , @entity66 , and excavated by fossil hunter @entity81 , also known as the ' @entity83 '			0
scientists believe that shortly after they died there was an earthquake that buried the bodies			0
they have been kept at a research lab in @entity80 since their discovery in 2006			1
the dinosaurs have since been identified as @entity91 , a close relative of @entity6 , and @entity93 from the @entity7 family			0
@entity91 is thought to have been a small but extremely dangerous little tyrannosaur			0
its head was about the length of an adult man 's arm and could run up to 30 kilometers in short spurts			0

‘ the fossils were discovered purely by chance on a ranch in @entity80			1
' the rancher spotted some bone fragments in the ground one day and called in @entity81 , the @entity83			0
‘ they unearthed what they thought was a @entity7 skeleton which would have been amazing on it 's own - but then they spotted some vertebrae nearby			1
‘ incredibly , they turned out to be from another dinosaur , a @entity6			0
@entity102 added that had they been found apart , each of these fossils would have been the most complete skeletons ever found			1
' but what makes the story even more amazing is that these dinosaurs were clearly locked in a bitter fight to the death that killed both of them , ' he said			2
‘ the @entity6 's skull and chest have been crushed , while some of its teeth are embedded in the @entity7 ' skull			0
‘ the @entity176 is huge , suggesting it was elderly , and clearly the @entity30 thought he could take it out but the @entity178 was wise and powerful and had other ideas			0
‘ we really hope a scientific institution will come forward to ensure these incredible fossils get the treatment they deserve , then go on public display for all to see			0
’ the auction will take place at @entity104 in @entity187 on november 19			1
