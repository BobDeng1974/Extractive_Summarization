revolutionary : the flow boiler looks much like any other , but it will generate electricity a new boiler could slash energy bills for families by turning their homes into mini power stations			1
the gas boiler – designed by a @entity10 firm – provides heating and hot water , while also fuelling an electricity generator to power household appliances			1
its maker claims that as well as making electricity bills cheaper , the boiler may eventually allow conventional power stations to be closed			1
the company , @entity20 , said it will provide the boilers – the first of which are due to be installed early next year – without householders paying for them up - front			1
instead the firm will be paid over five years through a monthly supplement on bills			0
crucially , this supplement should be cancelled out by savings on electricity as households generate their own power			0
this means energy bills will be no cheaper to begin with – but once the initial five - year contract is up , families will start to see considerable savings			2
they will use some of the electricity themselves , while any excess can be put into the @entity41			0
flow claims households could eventually save £ 500 a year through a combination of lower electricity bills and selling excess energy			2
if homeowners agree to split the benefits with the company , it will continue to provide a warranty on the generator after the five - year contract is up			2
in a conventional boiler , gas is burned to heat water , which then passes through the home ’s pipes and radiators			2
by contrast , gas in a flow boiler heats another liquid – a coolant similar to that used in refrigerators – until it evaporates			1
the vapour then moves through a device called a scroll expander , which starts to spin , acting as a mini electricity generator			1
adding this extra stage in the process does use slightly more gas			0
but @entity42 estimates the cost of this to be no more than £ 50 a year , which it says is easily cancelled out by the savings on electricity bills			2
initially , although the equipment itself is free , customers will need to pay to have the boiler installed			0
at the same time , they must sign up with @entity42 for a minimum of five years , accepting its tariffs without the option of shopping around for a cheaper deal			0
the boiler also only generates electricity when the heating is on , so its output will be greatly reduced during the summer			0
testing testing : the flow boilers are currently being prepared for a launch in january 2015 but @entity42 said it can still generate around @entity108 of electricity a year – about half of what a typical household needs			0
@entity42 ’s chief executive @entity113 said it is much more efficient to generate electricity close to the point of use than in a power station			0
the company claims that if 20million flow boilers were installed across the @entity10 , consumers would save more than £ 4billion a year on bills			1
it also says the reduction in carbon emissions would be equivalent to shutting 30 coal - fired power stations .			1

@entity20 say their boilers could lead to normal power stations closing
new device uses gas to heat liquid similar to coolant used in refrigerators
vapour then causes *mechanism* to spin - acting as *mini-electricity* generator
firm say 20 million of its boilers would save @entity10 consumers £ 4billion a year
