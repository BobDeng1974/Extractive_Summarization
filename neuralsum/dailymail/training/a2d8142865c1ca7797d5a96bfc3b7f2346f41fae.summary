a study has found that having to cope with stressful tasks can reduce a person 's mental faculties to those of a small child , such as reacting emotionally if you 've ever felt so stressed at work you 've considered throwing a tantrum , sulking or walking out , then you 're not alone			1
a study has found that having to cope with stressful tasks can reduce a person 's mental faculties to those of a small child			2
during tests , high levels of acute stress were found to lower the brain 's ability to think critically , reason , and make practical decisions			0
these are traits typically seen in small children who have to respond emotionally to situations they find difficult , said the study			1
researchers from @entity25 - based @entity24 , which carried out the study for healthcare providers @entity27 , asked 200 volunteers to take part in mental agility trials			1
the group was split in half , and 100 participants additionally took part in a series of stress - inducing tasks before and in - between the trials			1
the results ' overwhelmingly ' showed that stressed participants were more likely to make a wrong decision			1
they regularly chose the wrong answer , or reacted emotionally by making snap judgments based on a gut feeling			0
toddlers typically respond in a similar way , emotionally , to problems they find hard to understand , instead of arriving at a considered logical solution , said the researchers			2
neuroscientist dr @entity50 , director of @entity24 , said : ' when stressed , the focus of our attention tends to narrow and , if associated with strong emotions , we tend to act less rationally on occasions			2
during trials , in which 100 volunteers were put through stress - inducing tasks , results overwhelmingly ' showed stressed participants were more likely to react emotionally			1
acute stress was also found to lower their ability to think critically , reason , and make decisions			0

toddlers typically respond emotionally to problems they find hard to understand , instead of arriving at a considered logical solution in a similar way , said the researchers			2
' of course , this depends both on the stressor and other factors such as personality and the coping strategies available to the individual			0
' when stress arises unexpectedly , and is especially overwhelming , rational thinking tends to be replaced by impulsive and often faulty decision making			0
' this can be compared to a small child who responds emotionally to situations he or she finds stressful and frustrating			0
' @entity100 , from @entity27 's counselling service provider , @entity102 , added : ' many people harbour the view that a little bit of stress may be healthy as the added pressure that stress causes can positively affect their performance			0
' but this research shows that even small amounts of stress can have negative effects			0
' this should reassure people that they should seek help and support when the onset of stress begins , because it can have a detrimental effect from day one acted correctly			0
