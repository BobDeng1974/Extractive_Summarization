by @entity0 @entity1 is set to launch a launch a new subscription music service - but is locked in a major row with independent artists over the plans			1
the company acknowledged the plans after being dragged into a public dispute over royalties that will result in the blockade of some independent artists ' music videos			1
the @entity15 owned video site said in a statement that it is ' adding subscription - based features for music on @entity1 ' and that ' hundreds of major label and independent artists ' have signed on			1
@entity21 , who is signed with @entity23 's @entity22 in the @entity24 , but @entity27 's @entity26 label in the @entity28 could see her music banned from @entity1 in some territories over the deal			1
the paid service , to be launched within a few months , will likely allow playback of videos without ads and allow for offline playback on mobile devices			0
that 's according to two people familiar with the matter			0
the people were n't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the people also confirmed that a small number of independent artists who had not agreed to new deal terms will have their videos blocked in some countries starting in a few days , even on the free version of @entity1			1
@entity1 will block the music videos so users of the test version wo n't be confused about which content they can access for free and with features require payment , the people said			2
allowing free streams of music by certain artists while not offering them on the paid service would erode the value of the paid plan , one person said			0
the move also adds pressure on those labels to sign , because not being on @entity1 altogether will result in less advertising revenue and exposure			2
@entity1 has reached deals with all three major music labels — @entity70 , @entity27 , and @entity71 — and many independent labels as a whole representing about 95 percent of all labels , the people said			2
determining which artists are blocked — and where — could be confusing because some indie artists have their music distributed in certain countries by the major labels			2
@entity21 , for instance , is signed with @entity23 's @entity22 in the @entity24 , but @entity27 's @entity26 label distributes her music in the @entity28 @entity1 has reached deals with all three major music labels ¿ @entity70 , @entity27 , and @entity71 ¿ and many independent labels as a whole representing about 95 percent of all labels , it has been claimed			1
independent labels are being offered the same per - stream royalty payment as the major labels , but are not offered the same guarantees or advances for the first year			0
@entity93 , president of the @entity94 , an industry group representing independent labels , said he disagrees with the characterization that only a few labels have n't signed			0
he argued that independent artists are being treated unfairly simply because they lack market power			1
' i 'm not very happy , obviously , ' he said			0
' we 're asking to be treated equitably and fairly			0
' one person familiar with the terms said that independent labels are being offered the same per - stream royalty payment as the major labels , but are not offered the same guarantees or advances for the first year			2
@entity104 , ceo of the @entity105 , another trade group representing indie labels , said in a statement that @entity1 's decision to blockade some labels was a ' grave error of commercial judgment			0
' she said services like @entity115 and @entity116 have done a better job representing independent music on their platforms			0
@entity121 chief executive , @entity120 said : ' we think it is wrong for @entity1 / @entity15 to threaten to ostracise certain independents - denying fans the opportunity to hear their music , and labels and artists the chance to earn a living from it - because they are unwilling to surrender to a take it or leave it ultimatum			1
' as the dominant online video platform , @entity1 / @entity15 should negotiate fully and fairly with independents and not misuse its power			1

@entity15 *accused* of ' misusing its power ' in *negotiations*
independent artists who have not agreed to new deal terms will have their videos blocked from all @entity1 sites
artists *including* @entity21 , @entity146 and @entity147 could see their videos taken down
