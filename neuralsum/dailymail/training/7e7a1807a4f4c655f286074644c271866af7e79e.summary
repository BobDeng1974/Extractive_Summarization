@entity1 ’s defensive injury crisis deepened on monday night leaving him to consider plunging untried teenager @entity2 into @entity5 ’s @entity4 game at @entity6 on tuesday night			1
right back @entity2 , 19 , has made only one appearance for the club , as a late substitute in a @entity11 tie against @entity12 last season , but may be asked to start in @entity6 ’s intimidating @entity14			1
@entity16 did not travel to @entity17 because of a back problem , @entity15 is suffering from tonsilitis and is rated ‘ 50 - 50 ’ and @entity20 faces two months out after damaging ankle ligaments against @entity22 on saturday			1
if @entity23 is not fit to start , @entity1 can turn to @entity24 under 19 international @entity2 , who spent last season on loan at @entity26 , or switch @entity27 from midfield			1
@entity29 will come in for @entity16 at left back			1
@entity2 shakes hands with @entity31 in training , and could be in line for a start in @entity6 having played for @entity35 only last week at @entity36 @entity37 ( centre ) has shrugged off cramp and is available for @entity5 against @entity6 @entity5 manager @entity1 ponders his options during training ahead of the @entity4 match , as @entity2 trains at @entity42 before travelling to @entity6 @entity1 said : ' i do n't feel we are stretched			1
the @entity20 injury put us in a position where we do not want more and hopefully we have good news after the scan today that he can be back soon			1
' we have @entity23 who can play in different positions , @entity16 who can play centre - back and ( @entity2 ) @entity2 , who i think now is ready to play			1
' @entity52 ( @entity2 ) is a boy with personality			2
he 's not fazed by the pressure			2
that 's important when you 're a young boy			2
his transitional game is fantastic			0
' he 's quick and his final ball is good			0
he lacks a bit of experience but he 's very dangerous			0
' @entity62 has scored in his last three games for the @entity64 and looks likely to start on tuesday @entity65 played exceptionally against @entity22 and will be hoping to continue that form @entity68 's @entity6 side are the obvious threat to @entity5 in @entity70 of the @entity4 , and @entity1 believes @entity17 and @entity24 sides will be strong in the competition once again this season			1
' the main threats will be the @entity17 and @entity24 team , ' he continued			0
' look at the times @entity77 has been in the final			0
there 's no obvious reason why they should not be there again			0
' @entity6 have been a regular participant and the two big clubs in @entity24 will be main contenders again			2
' i have great respect for mr @entity68			0
he rose up very quickly in his career and inspired @entity6			2
what does he do better than me ? maybe a lot of things			0
but i love to see his squad playing dynamic and attractive football			0
' @entity1 hands out instructions to his players as they prepare for tuesday 's clash with @entity6 following a 2 - 2 draw with @entity22 at the @entity99 on saturday , @entity5 can take positives into the clash with @entity6			1
@entity37 had a promising debut despite being unable to find the net and @entity65 was particularly impressive			2
but @entity1 is cautious about using all his @entity17 @entity105 - winning players from the start , believing @entity107 , @entity31 and @entity108 are not yet fully match fit			1
@entity1 said : ' the ( @entity105 ) final in @entity110 was july 13			2
they came back on the august 11			0
that means i gave them one month of holiday			0
' it was important for me that they would recover			0
they have been training for one month and have n't reached 100 per cent physically yet but they 're close			0
' @entity37 looked relaxed as @entity5 jetted off to @entity17 ahead of their clash with @entity6 @entity121 ( left ) and @entity122 ( right ) looked happy as @entity5 flew to @entity17 for the @entity6 clash			1
