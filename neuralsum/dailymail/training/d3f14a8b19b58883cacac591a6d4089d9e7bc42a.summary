by @entity1 reporter published : 04:15 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 05:41 est , 14 may 2013 the man poised to become @entity4 's next prime minister has pledged to help @entity6 forces withdraw from @entity7 safely next year by allowing them to use his country 's roads to move troops and equipment			2
@entity12 , who is facing renewed allegations of vote rigging after video purporting to show election officials in @entity17 stuffing ballot boxes with votes , said he thought @entity4 had a good relationship with the @entity21			1
but he described the @entity23 's ongoing drone campaign in the country 's tribal region as a challenge to national sovereignty			1
we will extend full support to them			0
we will see that everything goes well and smoothly			0
' the @entity21 is reliant on @entity4 for help in neighboring @entity7 , where it will likely play a strong role in any reconciliation deal with @entity43 militants			1
much of the @entity21 military equipment that must be shipped out of @entity7 when the international coalition there ends its combat mission in 2014 will go through the port city of @entity17 in southern @entity4			2
it comes as fresh allegations of vote - rigging were being aimed against @entity12 â€™s @entity52 after video emerged appearing to show election officials stuffing ballot boxed with votes			1
a video released by the @entity59 party @entity58 , which finished fourth winning just ten seats , allegedly shows several women stuffing stacks of papers into ballot boxes at a polling station in @entity17			1
the video is one of several that have been aired on @entity4 television purporting to show evidence of vote rigging one of the women in the grainy video smiles towards the camera and puts a finger to her lips , appearing to make a ' be quiet ' gesture			1
it is one of several videos purporting to show vote - rigging which have been airing on @entity4 television news channels following saturday 's result			2
on monday @entity84 , an independent candidate from @entity4 's remote tribal areas , presented a mobile phone video to journalists showing ballot papers scattered on the ground near a polling station with sound of gunfire heard in the background			2
despite the allegations , @entity12 , a devout muslim and a populist , is expected to supplant president @entity97 as the international face of @entity4 following his party 's resounding victory in saturday 's election			1
the 63 - year - old @entity12 often hit out at the @entity21 in statements while lobbying for votes , and he accused the outgoing government ruled by the @entity105 of selling out the country 's sovereignty in exchange for @entity21 aid			1
however , analysts have cautioned that while such rhetoric sells on the campaign trail in a country where anti-american sentiment is high , @entity12 is likely to take a more nuanced approach to @entity21 relations once in office			1
' i think we have good relations with the @entity21			2
we certainly have to listen to each other , ' said @entity12			0
' if there are any concerns on any side , i think we should address those concerns			0
' sticking point : mr @entity12 described the @entity23 's ongoing drone campaign in the country 's tribal region as a challenge to national sovereignty @entity4 and the @entity21 have had an extremely fraught relationship in recent years , especially following the @entity21 raid that killed @entity134 in a @entity4 army town in 2011			1
the @entity21 did n't tell @entity4 about the operation beforehand , and the government was outraged at the breach of its sovereignty			1
even before the raid , the @entity21 accused @entity4 of supporting @entity43 militants who use the country 's rugged northwest tribal region to launch cross-border attacks against @entity21 troops in @entity7 - allegations denied by @entity146			2
the relationship has improved somewhat over the last year , but @entity21 drone attacks targeting @entity43 and @entity149 militants in @entity4 's tribal region continue to create serious friction between the two countries			1
the strikes are extremely unpopular in @entity4 , where many people believe they mostly kill innocent civilians - something @entity157 denies			0
' drones indeed are challenging our sovereignty , ' said @entity12			0
' i think this is a very serious issue , and our concern must be understood properly			0
' briefing : mr @entity12 talks to journalists at his opulent villa on the outskirts of @entity32 host : @entity169 offers a table full of food to journalists after a press conference at his house on the outskirts of @entity32 but @entity4 has a long history of officials condemning the strikes in public and supporting them in private , and how aggressively @entity12 pushes the @entity21 may depend on how much he needs it in other areas			1
@entity4 relies on the @entity21 for hundreds of millions of dollars in aid every year			2
more importantly , @entity4 would likely need @entity21 support to get a bailout it desperately needs from the @entity183 because of the government 's shaky financial situation			2
@entity12 spoke with reporters at his palatial estate in the rural town of @entity189 near the eastern city of @entity32			0
the estate is filled with acres of plush lawns and manicured gardens , where scores of majestic peacocks roam freely			0
the inside of his house is opulently decorated in a style reminiscent of @entity200 and features two stuffed lions - the symbol of @entity12 's party - at the entrance to his living room			0
@entity12 's supporters believe his pro-business background and years of experience in government make him the right person to tackle the country 's many economic woes , like growing power cuts , painful inflation and widespread unemployment			0
opulent : @entity12 's villa , which is decorated in a style reminiscent of @entity200 features two stuffed lions at the entrance to the living room his stance on reining in violent @entity223 extremism , however , remains uncertain			0
critics have accused his @entity226 party of being soft on radicals because it has n't cracked down on militant groups in its stronghold of @entity231 province			0
even if @entity12 wanted to shut down the @entity21 drone program , he would have to contend with the wishes of the @entity4 army , which is considered the strongest institution in the country and often plays a dominant role in national security issues			1
the army is known to have supported the drone program in the past			0
that cooperation has decreased over time as the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated			0
many analysts believe there is still grudging acceptance of the strikes - both because of @entity21 aid and because of the harm it would do to the relationship if @entity4 really put its foot down			1
the number of strikes targeting militants has dropped from a peak of more than 120 in 2010 to close to a dozen so far this year , but it 's unclear how much this trend has been driven by @entity21 decisions about targeting versus the political sensitivity of carrying out strikes .			0
