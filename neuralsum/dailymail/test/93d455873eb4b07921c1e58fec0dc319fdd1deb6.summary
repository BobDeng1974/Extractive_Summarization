@entity0 ended her whirlwind @entity2 campaign swing on tuesday afternoon in another state entirely , taking taxpayers for an 80 miles - per - hour ride all the way to @entity8 – to catch a flight with first class seats			1
her @entity11 - provided ' @entity13 ' van motored from @entity14 to @entity15 , escorted by troopers from both @entity2 and @entity17			1
she arrived in time to take a 7:00 p.m. @entity20 shuttle to @entity21 on the way , her motorcade passed exits to the @entity23 , @entity2 airport , which was 55 miles closer and offered a 5:16 p.m. flight to the same destination			1
the @entity8 flight , though , used a larger aircraft with 12 first class seats			2
the @entity23 flight was scheduled to use a smaller plane with nothing but coach			1
' @entity13 ' is seen next to the @entity49 sign with its side door open arrival : @entity0 was flanked by her security after she landed at @entity53 near @entity21 , insisting that she had n't booked the first class tickets herself – but staring ahead wordlessly when asked about the deadly @entity56 terror attack @entity2 ? no , it 's @entity17 : mrs. @entity0 's motorcade , including her custom conversion van ( center , in the distance ) , arrived just before 4:15 p.m. at @entity15 @entity62 : just a day earlier , @entity42 's motorcade zipped along wet @entity2 roads at 92 mph so she could make a dinner party on time @entity42 told @entity67 when she reached @entity21 and was asked why her security detail drove the extra miles at taxpayer expense : ' you know , i do n't make the travel arrangements			1
' she went silent , however , when asked if she would be ready soon to address public concerns about her performance as secretary of state before and after the 2012 terror attack that claimed four lives in @entity56 , @entity80			2
asked if she had made mistakes in the legacy - tarnishing episode , @entity42 stared straight ahead , continued walking alongside her @entity11 escort , and said nothing			1
in @entity2 , she had spent much of her time railing against @entity87 's richest ' 1 per cent , ' but ultimately took the priciest seat to @entity21 that she could buy without chartering a private plane			2
during her trip she said of the wealthy : ' the deck is stacked in their favor			2
my job is to reshuffle the cards			0
' according to the @entity97 , she spoke to a group of economists earlier this year about ' toppling ' the country 's financial elites if she were elected president			0
@entity103 : @entity0 met tuesday with @entity104 , the grand dame of @entity2 liberal politics and a woman who wields enormous grassroots organizing power in the @entity2 after a carefully stage - managed morning event at a community college near the state capitol , @entity42 held two private meetings , and then bolted to @entity8 at speeds 25 mph over the limit posted along portions of @entity116			1
at least the roads were dry			0
less than 24 hours earlier , her @entity11 drivers led reporters on a 92 - mph race through @entity2 on a rain - slicked freeway so mrs. @entity0 could arrive at a dinner event by 7:00 p.m. the @entity125 series aircraft took @entity42 and her closest aide @entity39 back to @entity21 in comfort			1
the two women had the very front seats on the flight			0
a @entity17 state trooper and a @entity11 agent greeted passengers on the jetway , providing the first hint that there was a vip on board			0
@entity42 's choice to fly out of @entity8 instead of @entity23 could anger southern @entity2 voters who tire of being told they are little more than a @entity8 exurb			1
there is no meaningful @entity17 presidential primary election			0
scooby ! @entity42 's ubiquitous van left @entity104 's home tuesday afternoon en route to the @entity150 headquarters farewell : @entity0 waves at the end of her final campaign stop in @entity2 , before hitting the road to @entity8 at speeds of up to 80mph last stop : @entity42 's hopeful @entity2 trip ended not with a nod to everyday @entity87 , but with a bow to @entity150 insiders at the @entity150 headquarters @entity42 's first afternoon meeting came at the home of @entity104 , the 95 - year - old grand dame of @entity2 @entity150 politics			1
the significance of the get - together is real : democrats seeking any major office in the @entity2 have sought her counsel and kissed her ring for decades			0
her second meeting was an hours - long affair at the @entity150 headquarters , which hosted her while a crowd of reporters and photographers waited in vain for her to answer questions			0
while still more journalists lay in wait under the shadow of the state @entity186 , @entity42 's entourage went the other way , southward , boxing out motorists who tried to share their chosen slice of the road			2
it 's not clear who drove @entity194 and its two companion suvs away from the @entity8 airport			0
all three vehicles were still curbside 45 minutes after @entity42 arrived			0
in @entity14 : @entity0 smiled after a roundtable conversation with students and faculty of @entity202 , the community college local to @entity14 , @entity2			0

*speedometer* - *busting* race to @entity15 hit 80 in a 55 mph zone
@entity42 and her entourage took @entity45 flight 2120 to @entity211 – and sat in first class
first class seating came after campaign trip where she said of rich : ' the deck is stacked in their favor . my job is to reshuffle the pack . '
the @entity23 , @entity2 airport would have been 55 miles closer and had a flight two hours earlier – but it was on smaller plane with only coach seats
@entity42 insisted she did n't *personally* book the tickets , but stared ahead and said nothing when asked about the @entity56 terror attacks
@entity236 - like trip down @entity116 came less than 24 hours after @entity42 's @entity11 detail raced down rain - slicked @entity2 freeways at 92 mph
