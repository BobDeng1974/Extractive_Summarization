by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 11 october 2012 a property developer has been given six months to tear down a secret house which she built disguised as a garage			1
@entity4 , 46 , designed the plush two - storey home , complete with two double bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms and modern kitchen , under the guise of a garage workshop in her back garden			1
she and her builder husband @entity12 , 46 , erected the 30ft high building in 2006 to live in while they were building their bigger house just yards away			0
looks like a garage ... but it 's a house : behind the garage doors is a plush two - storey home the couple only had permission to build a garage and workshop on the plot , but went ahead and built the two - bedroom home instead - fixing a fake double garage door to the outside in a bid to fool the authorities			1
but at the back of the building , they installed a satellite dish , three skylights on the pitched roof and a kitchen window overlooking rolling countryside			0
the case bears similarities to a couple who disguised their £ 500,000 home as a hay barn and lost a four - year legal battle to save it last year			2
property developer @entity44 and his wife @entity45 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , had been granted permission to build a barn for agricultural use – but then fitted it out as a luxury two - storey home			1
they tried to outwit council planners by disguising their house as a windowless barn and surrounding it with farmyard machinery			0
access : the door and windows are hidden from view from the front of the house - but are clear from the side meanwhile , @entity65 of @entity66 near @entity67 , @entity68 , kept a castle in one of his fields shielded behind a 40ft stack of hay bales covered by a huge tarpaulin			0
once it was finished , he and his family moved in and lived there for four years before finally revealing the development complete with battlements and cannons in august 2006 , but the authorities ordered it to be pulled down			1
mr and mrs @entity4 lived inside their secret ' garage ' for two years before moving into their new house next door and renting it out to two tenants before neighbours tipped off the local council			1
when planning officers opened the garage door they discovered there was only 2ft of space behind it and a partition wall backing onto a swanky open plan kitchen diner			1
no permission : the house in @entity104 , @entity105 with the garage on the right secret : the windows overlooking the rolling countryside can be clearly from a nearby field inside the property in picturesque @entity104 , @entity105 , they also built two double bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms with showers , and a living room			1
the brazen pair even held a party to celebrate moving into the property which was attended by 16 friends and family on christmas day in 2006 before renting out the property in 2008 to make extra income			0
mrs @entity4 , a director of the now defunct property development firm @entity124 and @entity125 , applied for retrospective planning permission to build the house last year			2
comfortable : the ' garage ' has two double bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms , showers and a living room but @entity133 rejected the planning application and mrs @entity4 appealed the ruling and the case was decided by the government ’s @entity137			1
earlier this year the @entity137 upheld the council ’s decision and yesterday she was given six months to gut the building			0
@entity137 @entity142 told mrs @entity4 she had ' behaved unreasonably from the outset ' and had desperately tried to ' find a loophole in the system '			2
she said : ' the appellant deliberately set out to deceive the council			0
to my mind , the appellant has behaved unreasonably from the outset , and the retrospective case that she has put forward has evolved to suit her circumstances			0
disguised : @entity65 outside his ' castle ' home he built in @entity66 near @entity67 , @entity68			2
he kept the castle shielded behind a 40ft stack of hay bales covered in a huge tarpaulin the 40ft stacks of hay bales covered by a huge tarpaulins , which concealed the @entity164 ' mock @entity163 castle ' after the dwelling came to the attention of the council , the appellant has tried , without success , to find a loophole in the planning system that would enable her to retain the dwelling			0
' first , she fraudulently tried to argue that the building had initially been built as a garage and then subsequently converted to a dwelling			2
' when that approach was unsuccessful , instead , in the current appeal , she has admitted the building had been erected as a dwelling but she has tried to argue that due to the passage of time , it was too late for the council to take enforcement action			0
' the barn built by @entity44 and his wife @entity45 which they converted to become a two storey home mrs @entity4 was given six months to strip the building of its bathrooms , kitchen and internal partition wall which prevented it from being used as a garage			1
following the ruling , councillor @entity197 , the district council ’s portfolio holder for planning and housing , said : ' this case should be a warning to others who believe they can obtain retrospective permission through deliberate concealment of an unauthorised development			0
