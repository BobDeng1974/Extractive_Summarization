by @entity0 for the first time at this @entity3 , everyone is on the same page in @entity5			1
that page is the front page of the @entity7 , which for the last three days has simply been a countdown to sunday 's @entity9			1
before the 7 - 1 win over @entity11 , @entity5 was hardly united behind their team			1

the phrase on everyone 's lips is ' fourth star '			2
it refers to the stars sewn above the emblem on the @entity5 shirt			2
at the moment , there are three , one for each time @entity5 have won this tournament			2
@entity53 @entity5 released an advert this week saying that the shirt with three stars is only available for a short time longer			2
above the @entity60 headquarters of the @entity61 , @entity5 's second biggest political party , there is a banner reading ' get the fourth star , boys ! '			1
in all those messages , there is confidence that @entity5 will , indeed , get the fourth star			1
after the demolition of @entity11 , the nation believes that they are favourites			0
there is little arrogance , though			0
people know how good @entity75 is , how rigid @entity76 have been at the back in this tournament			0
they know it could go wrong			0
low and his team are also going out of the way to play down any mindless euphoria			0
after the @entity11 game , @entity14 demanded ' humility ' , and that has been the party line from the squad ever since			1
@entity89 and @entity90 have spoken about how well they understand the dangers of @entity76			0
backing : the public , press and advertisers in @entity5 have all joined the bandwagon lethal : all time @entity3 record scorer @entity97 ( left ) and @entity98 forward @entity90 @entity90 , though , could not resist adding ' if nothing else works , we 'll just score from a set piece			1
we 're already world champions in that '			0
for among the humility , there is a powerful optimism			0
@entity109 's statement that all players were fit and ready to play did a lot to alleviate fears			0
@entity113 in particular was a doubt for the final , and many see him as a key to stopping @entity75			0
' we have a plan for @entity75 ' said @entity14 's assistant @entity119 on thursday			1
many are confident that it will work , and are pointing to the way @entity98 played the @entity123 out of the game last year when they faced @entity125 in the @entity126			0
leader : manager @entity128 takes a shot on goal during a training session in @entity32 opposition : @entity76 train at their base just outside @entity135 in preparation for the showdown many have said that , after he result against @entity11 , this @entity31 side have already made history			1
that has helped to loosen the pressure on this team , but the note between humility and optimism that @entity14 's team are striking is a sensible one			1
