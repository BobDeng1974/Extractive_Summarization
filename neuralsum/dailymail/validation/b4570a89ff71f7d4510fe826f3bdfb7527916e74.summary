a police department employee will be fired and two suspended after being identified by a @entity5 report as sending racist emails , the mayor of @entity1 told reporters			1
mayor @entity8 made the announcement wednesday after attorney general @entity10 said the report showed police created a ' highly toxic environment ' in @entity1			1
' let me be clear , this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the @entity17 or in any department in the city of @entity1 , ' @entity8 said at the conference			1
' the mayor did not take any questions at the presser , and though @entity1 police chief @entity43 had been expected to attend , no explanation was given for his absence			2
the @entity5 investigation into @entity1 police began in august after the shooting of unarmed african - american teen @entity48 by a white officer sparked national protests			1
analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in @entity1 , an unnamed department official said			1
the @entity5 report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black			1
according to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014 , blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops , though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers			0
a @entity5 investigation has found patterns of racial bias in the @entity1 police department and at the municipal jail and court			1
the full report will be publicly released march 4 @entity5 staff interviewed hundreds of average citizens as part of the six - month probe , concluding that a large portion of @entity1 's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were @entity90 @entity10 also said that charges for minor violations such as ' manner of walking in roadway ' disproportionately affected black residents and were used ' not as a public service , but as a tool for raising revenue			1
' @entity100 protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of @entity90 in @entity1 , @entity103 and @entity104 laid bare racial tensions and what president @entity34 called ' simmering distrust ' between police and communities			1
black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops , compared to their white counterparts			0
@entity5 officials found from 2012 to 2014 that black motorists in @entity1 , @entity119 , were more than twice as likely as whites to be searched in traffic stops , even though they were 26 per cent less likely to be found carrying contraband			1
african - americans were 68 per cent less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by a municipal court judge			2
and from april to september of last year , 95 per cent of people kept at the city jail for more than two days were black , the six - month inquiry found			1
of the cases in which the police department documented the use of force , 88 per cent involved blacks , and victims of the 14 dog bites recorded by the department all were black			2
overall , @entity90 make up 67 per cent of the population of @entity1 , about 10 miles north of downtown @entity140			2
the @entity5 plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with @entity1 officials and enter a consent decree , or to sue the city to force change			1
previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the @entity5 and installing federal monitors to oversee operations			2
the report 's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in @entity1			2
but they are unlikely to restore full trust in the @entity1 police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict @entity48 's killer , officer @entity162			1
after a separate investigation , the @entity5 decided not to pursue federal charges against @entity162 , who has said he acted in self - defense			1
civil rights attorney @entity166 , who has represented people who have clashed with @entity1 police and city officials , said he was not surprised by the findings , and he hopes to see @entity1 police chief @entity43 fired			2
' we already knew all this was going on			0
the problem is nobody is being prosecuted , nobody has been terminated , ' @entity173 said			0
@entity43 did not respond to a request for comment			0
among the emails was one sent sent by a @entity1 police or municipal court official in 2008 that said @entity34 would not stay in office long because , ' what black man holds a steady job for four years ? ' another electronic missive , written in 2011 , included an offensive joke : ' an @entity90 - @entity90 woman in @entity188 was admitted into the the hospital for a pregnancy termination			1
two weeks later she received a check for $ 5,000			0
she phoned the hospital to ask who it was from			0
the hospital said , " @entity196			0
" ' @entity198 @entity197 said she was outraged by that and other racially tinged emails found in the investigation			2
biased : the investigation found @entity1 officers too often charged blacks with petty offenses ' the fact that police officers and municipal court officials are using their public emails to tell racial jokes , that just reeks of arrogance and ignorance , ' said @entity197			1
they think they are untouchable			0
the taxpayers have been paying for that racial bias			0
' a separate report to be issued soon is expected to clear @entity1 police officer @entity162 of federal civil rights charges in the @entity48 killing the official said that in @entity1 's court system , african - americans were less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and made up 95 percent of people held longer than two days in the @entity1 jail			1
the @entity228 issued the majority of its warrants for minor violations such as parking , traffic and housing code violations			0
the physical tussle that led to @entity48 's death began after @entity162 told him and a friend to move from the street to the sidewalk			0
@entity240 , the attorney for the @entity48 family , said that if the reports about the findings are true , they ' confirm what @entity48 's family has believed all along			0
' ' that is that the tragic killing of an unarmed 18 - year - old black teenager was part of a systemic pattern of inappropriate policing of @entity90 - @entity90 citizens in the @entity1 community			1
' since 2010 , according to the federal agency , @entity1 courts have raked in more than $ 442,000 in fines for failure to appear , which amounted to a quarter of the court 's annual revenue , reported the @entity261			0
the onerous ' failure to appear ' charge , which disproportionately affected those living close to and below the poverty line , was dropped by the city in september			0
mayor @entity8 made statements earlier expressing dissatisfaction with the @entity5 investigation , according to @entity270			1
' i 'm not comfortable that @entity10 announced that there would be wholesale changes before he started collecting any evidence , ' @entity8 said			2
' if the @entity5 has some serious findings , i hope they will provide that to us			0
' @entity278 , a @entity140 community activist , praised the findings , saying ' @entity1 police have to see the light in how they deal with people of color			2
' it 's quite evident that change is coming down the pike			0
this is encouraging , ' he said			0
' it 's so unfortunate that @entity48 had to be killed			0
but in spite of that , i feel justice is coming			0

@entity1 mayor @entity8 announced the termination at a press conference wednesday
emails found by the @entity5 included jokes about the president and first lady
one email said @entity34 would n't be president for very long because ' what black man holds a steady job for four years '
from april to september , 95 per cent of people kept at the city jail for more than two days were black
report shows that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were @entity90 - @entity90
