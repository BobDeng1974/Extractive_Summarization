officiating was better this saturday but there were still errors , as there will always be			0
often errors are understandable and have to be accepted as part of the game , but some are inexplicable and when i was refereeing @entity11 games we were told that ' you can not defend the indefensible '			2
there were three clear errors on saturday and one was understandable but two were not			0
@entity16 went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee @entity18 having a clear view @entity21 's @entity20 protested to referee @entity18 , who waves his appeals away despite @entity20 's impassioned appeals to the official , @entity21 were not awarded the penalty referees hope any errors do not affect the outcome of the game but unfortunately it appeared that @entity18 failing to award @entity21 a clear penalty when @entity16 handled the ball towards the end of game against @entity36 did just that			1
@entity21 were trailing 1 - 2 when a shot was clearly blocked by @entity16 ’s outstretched arm and an apparently well positioned @entity18 gave nothing			1
it was inexplicable as he had nobody blocking his view and he had no reason to look anywhere else – in other words an ' indefensible ' error			0
@entity47 had a different issue at @entity49 where he disallowed a perfectly good goal for offside when his assistant , @entity52 , signalled that @entity53 was offside			2
replays clearly showed @entity53 to be inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal the @entity58 's celebrations were cut short when assistant @entity52 inexplicably flagged for offside @entity59 could n't believe his bad luck but @entity61 still went on to win the match it was a really poor decision as @entity59 was in his own half when the ball was played forward			1
luckily it did n't affect the outcome as @entity61 were already 2 - 1 up and the game finished shortly after the incident but i expect the assistant to miss a game next weekend			2
the most interesting incident came in @entity75 ’s win at @entity76 and preceded @entity78 ’s second goal by @entity79			1
@entity78 ’s @entity80 was chasing a through ball which @entity82 was trying to shepherd out of play			1
@entity80 nicked the ball and both players ran off the field			0
to escape the attentions of @entity82 , @entity80 clearly pushed him which if within the field of play it would have been as easy free kick to give			2
referee @entity91 gave nothing , perhaps thrown by the location of the incident when he should have stopped play for the push and restarted with a drop ball			0
i could understand this error and again it did n’t affect the final result			0
@entity78 's @entity80 ( left ) and @entity75 's @entity82 were involved in an incident on saturday @entity103 's decision to award @entity104 a penalty after this @entity106 tackle was correct on sunday , @entity103 made an excellent decision in awarding @entity108 a penalty			1
@entity106 made no attempt to play the ball and stood up to block @entity104 as he attempted to run into the penalty area			0
watching @entity113 — and also watching where he was looking — confirmed the defender ’s intentions and @entity103 will have seen that before pointing to the penalty spot			1
although there was not a huge amount of contact , it was clearly a foul and an unnecessary one for the @entity123 skipper to make .			0

saturday 's @entity11 action saw three clear refereeing errors
@entity36 's @entity16 clearly handballed but @entity21 were not awarded a penalty by referee @entity18
the official had a clear view of the incident was was n't moved by appeals
@entity61 's @entity53 had a clear goal disallowed for offside
the @entity58 defender was in his own half when ball was played
at @entity78 , @entity80 shoved @entity75 's @entity82 off the field
the move resulted in a goal for @entity78 's @entity79
@entity103 got @entity108 's penalty spot on at the @entity147
