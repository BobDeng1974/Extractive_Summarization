a flight attendants ' union is trying to overturn rules allowing airplane passengers to use cellphones and other device during take - off and landing			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) changed its guidance last year , allowing passengers to use their devices freely while flying			1
but the @entity12 says the agency did n't follow procedure when they made the change - and also that letting passengers keep cellphones on is distracting and could be dangerous			1
bring back the ban ? the @entity12 wants passengers to put away their phones again but their arguments made little impression at the @entity23 , who said that the call is - and always has been - one for airlines to make , rather than the government			1
although the three - judge panel , sitting in @entity30 , has yet to deliver a written warning , they seemed to suggest the union , which has 60,000 members , will not succeed			2
judge @entity34 told one of the union lawyers : ' airlines have always had discretion on how to handle this			0
' the @entity8 announced late last year that it was changing guidance that had for years resulted in passengers stowing cellphones , tablets , and music and video players during takeoffs and landings			1
under new guidance , airlines can let passengers use them at any point as long as the plane is protected from electronic interference and the airlines get the @entity8 's approval			1
restrictions : the @entity8 relaxed its guidance last year , freeing millions of passengers to use their phones cellphones still must be in airplane mode when in use			1
since the announcement , the @entity8 has cleared 31 airline operators to let their passengers use the devices they want			1
between them the operators carry around 96 per cent of @entity70 fliers			0
@entity72 lawyer @entity71 told the judges that ' anyone who has been on a plane in the last year has seen a huge change			0
' but she argued that in relaxing the rules , officials violated the federal @entity80			0
other devices : items including tablets , music players and video players are also covered by the rules the act requires government agencies to give the public notice and the ability to comment when a rule is changed			2
that did n't happen properly , the union argues			0
judge @entity94 asked about the flight attendants ' concern that allowing passengers to keep out electronics leaves ' more things to fly around ' the airplane cabin during turbulence			2
but a lawyer for the government , @entity102 , told the judges that cellphones and other small devices are no more dangerous than books that passengers have always been allowed to keep out			0
the government argued in court documents that the judges hearing the case do n't have authority to review the issue and that the @entity8 's action did n't trigger public notice and comment requirements			2
the @entity8 did request and receive public feedback before updating its guidance , and considered 1,000 responses including one from the union , attorneys wrote			0
still , the government said the @entity8 merely told the airlines its opinion on the matter - which has always in fact been a decision for the individual companies .			0
