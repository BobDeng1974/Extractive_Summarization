a unique archive charting the wartime development of the jet engine by the pioneering engineer sir @entity5 is expected to fetch up to £ 30,000 at auction next month			1
this sketch of how the engine would work ( pictured ) is among the papers for sale it will be sold at @entity30 in @entity31 on november 12 , when experts expect it to fetch between £ 20,000 and £ 30,000			1
@entity30 specialist @entity34 said : ' this is one of the most important and complete archives on a technological development which has shaped all our lives			1
' it is a fascinating insight into the often tortuous way in which an idea takes shape and progresses through trial and error against the backdrop of the misunderstandings and professional frustrations common to any project			0
' sir @entity5 , a @entity9 @entity8 engineer air officer , is credited with single handedly inventing the turbojet engine - one of the major technological developments of the 20th century the development of the jet engine influenced not only the course of @entity56 but underpinned the huge expansion of commercial aviation in the post war period			1
it enabled planes to fly at high altitude and at speeds of over 500 miles per hour for the first time			0
a 2002 @entity66 poll of the @entity67 ranked sir @entity5 at number 42			2
the archive is contained in a ' special file , ' which belonged to @entity71 , who was senior director and chief engineer of @entity73			1
the archive , which consists of around 220 drawings including this one , blueprints , specifications , memoranda and letters , effectively tells the story of how it was developed during the crucial period in the early years of the war the company manufactured the engine for @entity5 and @entity85 , under contract from the @entity87 , between january 1940 and june 1941			1
sir @entity5 had been working on his idea of a jet engine since 1930 and with financial backing , had established the company , @entity91 , to develop the idea further			1
he attracted no interest from the @entity94 , however , until the late 1930s when the combination of the threat of war and the technological advances which @entity5 was able to demonstrate changed official minds			0
the development of the jet engine influenced not only the course of @entity56 but underpinned the huge expansion of commercial aviation in the post war period			1
pictured is a letter from the @entity108 by 1940 the @entity87 was writing to mr @entity71 emphasising the importance of the work			0
one extract from the papers that will be sold , said : ' i hope that if you are fully aware of the great importance that the @entity87 attach to the development of this @entity5 engine you will take all steps in your power to ensure that no unnecessary delay occurs in the completion of these engines and that you will do all in your power to assist @entity91 in their work			2
' sir @entity5 's genius lay in realising that propeller engines , with their hundreds of complicated working parts , were approaching the limit of their capacity			2
another intricate drawing by sir @entity5 showing the workings of the jet engine			1
his genius lay in realising that propeller engines were approaching the limit of their capacity			0
to enable planes to fly at speeds of over 500 miles per hour he proposed using a variant on the internal combustion engine with the hot gases used for propulsion to enable planes to fly at high altitude and at speeds of over 500 miles per hour he proposed using a variant on the internal combustion engine , which directly heats the air by combusting fuel , with the resultant hot gases used for propulsion			0
with far fewer components than propeller engines this also had the advantage of being much simpler to maintain			0
sir @entity5 is reported to have said : ' reciprocating engines are exhausted			2
they have hundreds of parts jerking to and fro and they can not be made more powerful without becoming too complicated			0
' the engine of the future must produce 2000 horsepower with one moving part : a spinning turbine and compressor			0
' his work was developed some years earlier than that of @entity169 's dr @entity168 who was the designer of the first operational jet engine			0
each worked separately and knew nothing of the other 's work			0
@entity5 was the first to register a patent for the turbojet engine in january 1930 , while mr von @entity168 was granted a patent for his turbojet engine in 1936			2
however , mr von @entity180 's jet was the first to fly in 1939 - sir @entity5 's jet first flew in in 1941			0
sir @entity5 , who was born in @entity182 , @entity183 , retired from the @entity8 in 1948 , was a founding member of the @entity185 and received a knighthood			1
he later relocated to @entity187 and died in 1996 at his home in @entity189 , @entity190			0
sir @entity5 's work was developed some years earlier than that of @entity169 's dr @entity168 who was the designer of the first operational jet engine			2
@entity5 was the first to register a patent for the turbojet engine and his jet flew in 1941			2
this image shows a telegram telling the engineer to proceed with production of the engines			0

sir @entity5 , a @entity9 @entity8 engineer air officer , is credited with inventing the turbojet engine that influenced the course of @entity56
a *collection* of 220 drawings and letters that *detail* the development of the engine will be sold at @entity30 auction house on november 12
the archive is contained in a ' special file ' and is said to be one of the most important and complete archives of a technological development
