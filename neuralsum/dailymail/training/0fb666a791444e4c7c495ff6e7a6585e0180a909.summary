by @entity0 we 've all gone into a restaurant planning to order something healthy - only to end up devouring the most calorific option			1
now scientists say they have worked out why we get so easily derailed when dining out			2
they say the answer may not lie with a lack of willpower or judgement - but could actually be the menu 's fault			2
diners can be derailed from healthy eating simply by the way a menu is designed , researchers say ' what you order may have less to do with what you want - and more to do with a menu 's layout and descriptions , ' says @entity23 , professor of consumer behaviour at @entity25 in the @entity26 he and his team drew their conclusions after analysing 217 menus and the selections of more than 300 diners			1
first , menu layout may be to blame			0
any dish that attracts attention - for example listed in bold , highlighted , in a coloured font or boxed out - makes us more likely to order that than the item listed next to it			1
' but in most cases , these are the least healthy items on the menu , ' says professor @entity23			2
second , menus with items described in detail sell better - and lead us to believe they taste better			1
previous research has found that when restaurant menu items were re-named to make them more descriptive , they were more popular			2
when the seafood filet became @entity52 - and red beans and rice became @entity55 - sales of these items went up by 28 per cent and they were rated as tastier , even though the recipe was identical			1
diners were also willing to pay an average of 12 per cent more for a menu item with a descriptive name			0
often the most unhealthy items are listed in bold , highlighted or boxed out - to attract attention ' when it comes to what you order for dinner , two things matter most : what you see on the menu and how you imagine it will taste , ' adds professor @entity23 , author of @entity73 : @entity74			1
so how do you navigate a menu and and avoid order envy or calorie guilt ? ' just ask your server , ' he advises			0
' ask " what are your two or three lighter entrées that get the most compliments ? ' or ' what 's the best thing on the menu if a person wants a light dinner ? " ' the research will be published this month in the @entity88 of @entity89			0
research published in may found restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than if it is offered for a smaller price			0
people who paid $ 8 instead of $ 4 for a buffet enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the cheaper food			0
those that paid for the $ 4 ( £ 2.40 ) buffet said felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate .			0

we *'re* more likely to choose items that are highlighted , bold or boxed out
but these are usually the unhealthiest options , say @entity26 researchers
items described in detail sell better - because we believe they taste better
