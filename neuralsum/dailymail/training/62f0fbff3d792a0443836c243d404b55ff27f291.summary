@entity2 , a senior reactor operator at the @entity5 nuclear plant , was extradited from @entity7 late last month after a year on the run and has started serving his 40 - year sentence for the carjacking			1
he is still awaiting possible additional charges in connection for his alleged smuggling , which happened in the @entity27 country where he was hiding from authorities			2
he is the alleged mastermind of the scheme , which was supposedly inspired by the 2010 @entity31 movie @entity32 , in which a group of @entity35 buddies rob several banks and @entity37 , according to @entity38			1
according to court and @entity41 documents , @entity2 tried to recruit co-workers at the nuclear plant , about 45 miles south of @entity6 , and eventually succeeded in persuading colleague , @entity44 , to participate in the robbery of an armored car			1
the two never managed to do the robbery because they were caught for stealing a car they planned to use for the heist			2
the crime spree started on may 9 , 2012 , when @entity2 accosted a woman in a parking lot outside a @entity56 ’s store in @entity57 , about 30 minutes west of @entity6			1
police said he was disguised as an old man in an elaborate latex mask and threatened the woman with a .45 - caliber @entity62 semiautomatic handgun before speeding off in her 2000 @entity63			0

‘ i ’ve been in investigations quite a bit of my career , and for someone like @entity96 , who seemed to have a lot going for him , to be messed up in something like this , i ’ve never seen anything like it , ’ said @entity57 , @entity90 , deputy police chief @entity91			0
the case also sent ripples through the nuclear power industry , prompting the @entity105 – which owns the @entity5 plant and is the largest @entity108 operator of nuclear reactors – to change how it trains its employees to spot and report behavior that might pose a security threat			1
@entity2 was released on bond , but police were alerted by a girlfriend who said he was intending to flee to @entity116 and had access to offshore bank accounts , according to @entity38			2
in june 2012 , a judge added conditions to his bail , including a @entity123 ankle monitor			0

the bank robbery plot emerged a month later at another hearing at which he was sentenced to 40 years in prison by then , @entity2 and @entity44 were reportedly living the high life in @entity7			1
an independent journalist who has covered the case said the former power plant operators had rented an apartment in a luxury high - rise building in @entity161 and frequented a nearby gym			0
protocol : the case prompted @entity105 - which owns the @entity5 plant where @entity2 worked , and is the largest @entity108 operator of nuclear reactors - to change how it trains its employees to report strange behavior they might be there yet had they not gotten involved with a @entity7 man who was under suspicion of drug trafficking , illegal weapons trade and money laundering by authorities there , said journalist @entity178 , who writes for a nuclear power website , @entity180			1
