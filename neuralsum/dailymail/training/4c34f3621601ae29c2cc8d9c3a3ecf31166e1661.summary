the discovery of @entity2 clusters , known as ‘ blueberries ’ , a decade ago provided some of the first evidence of liquid water on the red planet			1
this incredible close up , taken by the @entity9 , reveals these spheres embedded in @entity2 rock like blueberries in a muffin			1
the image is part of an exhibition by the @entity18 's @entity17 presenting more than 50 of the best photographs from two rovers known as @entity21			1
these hematite - rich spherules were embedded in this @entity2 rock like blueberries in a muffin and released over time by erosion			1
the @entity9 found this cluster at its @entity27 landing site and analysed their composition with its spectrometers			0
hypotheses about their formation have contributed to the story of water on @entity2 ten years after @entity36 landed the two rovers on @entity2 for a 90 - day mission , one is still exploring , and the project has generated hundreds of thousands of images from the planet 's surface			1
the @entity9 found this ' blueberry ' cluster at its @entity27 landing site and analysed the composition with its spectrometers			2
previous theories suggested they were created by simple chemical reactions without the help of life			0
however , research last year revealed clear evidence that microbes were essential in their formation			0
this raised the possibility that @entity2 ‘ blueberries ’ may not only reveal that water was present on @entity2 - but also ancient microbial life			1
a view by the @entity59 of a sunset over the rim of @entity62 , about 80 km ( 50 miles ) away			0
taken from @entity64 , it looks much like a sunset on @entity66 , a reminder that other worlds can seem eerily familiar			1
@entity70 and twilight images help scientists to determine how high into the atmosphere the @entity2 dust extends and to look for dust or ice clouds ‘ @entity77 ’ , curated by the scientists who have led the mission , opens tomorrow in @entity76			1
along with unusual ‘ blueberry ’ clusters , it includes large - scale photographs of craters , hills , dunes , dust clouds , meteorites , rock formations and the @entity2 sunset			1
@entity91 , a planetary geologist at the museum who is part of the rover mission team , organised the exhibition , in part as a travel log with images on one side from @entity101 and images from @entity9 on the other			2
the rovers landed in january 2004 on opposite sides of @entity2 and began exploring volcanic deposits and plains , as well as meteorites and impact craters			1
rover tracks are shown disappearing toward the horizon in a sea of sand between the craters endurance and @entity115 on the @entity116			0
@entity2 rover opportunity took the image while stuck in the sand ripple , dubbed @entity120 , for over a month a wheel that was used to test the @entity21 on @entity66 before their mission is also on display			1
after about 800 days , one of @entity59 's front wheels stalled and stopped functioning			0
the engineering team decided to continue driving it in reverse , dragging the broken wheel across the @entity2 surface ‘ every one of the images you see here tells a story of discovery that goes along with the story of beauty on @entity2 , ’ dr @entity91 said			1
‘ it 's a look at an alien planet through the rovers ' eyes			1
’ uncovering signs of the past presence of water and a more habitable environment are among the rovers ' most important discoveries			0
some were made by accident			0
after about 800 days , one of @entity59 's front wheels stalled and stopped functioning			0
the engineering team decided to continue driving it in reverse , dragging the broken wheel across the @entity2 surface			2
that dragging dug a trench behind the rover that soon uncovered a new material as white as snow			0
this piece of metal with the @entity166 flag on it is made of aluminum recovered from the site of the @entity171 towers in @entity172			0
it is located on @entity59 and serves as a cable guard for @entity59 , a ­ s a rock abrasion tool as well as a memorial to the victims of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
@entity9 has an identical piece @entity180 astronomy professor @entity181 ( right ) and @entity183 science division director @entity182 ( left ) look at the ' @entity21 : 10 years roving across @entity2 ' it turned out to be silica material that would normally be found in hot springs and hydrothermal systems - habitable environments			2
‘ it was a total surprise , ’ said @entity181 , an astronomy professor at @entity180 who headed the @entity21			2
‘ it was just pure good luck			0
we would n't have even seen that if we did n't have the busted wheel			0
’ the rovers also found concretions and layered sedimentary rocks made of sulphate salt that showed water had once been on the planet 's surface			2
while some panoramic images clearly show the red @entity2 landscape , other images focus on other colours that can be found in @entity2 ' rocks , soil and sky			2
one image of the @entity2 sunset shows a bluish colour in the sky , which is usually pink in the daytime due to the reddish dust in the atmosphere			1
it turns blue at sunset - the opposite of @entity66 , professor @entity181 said			1
@entity182 , @entity36 director of planetary science , said the rovers have made huge strides in learning about @entity2 to eventually send humans there			2
the curiosity rover is also now exploring the surface of the red planet , and @entity36 plans to send more rovers before humans			0

photographs part of exhibition by @entity18 's @entity17 opening in @entity76 tomorrow
incredible close up shows spheres , dubbed blueberries , that may suggest ancient microbial life on the planet
along with ‘ blueberry ’ clusters , the exhibition includes photographs of craters , dunes , dust clouds and meteorites
