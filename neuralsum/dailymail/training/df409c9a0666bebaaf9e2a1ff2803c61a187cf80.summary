by @entity1 reporter published : 09:55 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 10:04 est , 11 april 2012 bonuses offered by the @entity4 's biggest securities companies to recruit top brokers are reaching their loftiest levels since the financial crisis , and none of the big firms are retreating from the bidding war			1
the brokerage arms of banks such as @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are offering high - end @entity4 brokers two to three times the commissions and fees they produced in the previous year , up from about one times those earnings previously			1
the bonuses , which can approach $ 15million for some teams over several years , have steadily escalated and include perks such as prime parking spaces and the hiring of brokers ' sales assistants , recruiters say			1
recruitment : @entity13 is among one of the banks offering commissions two to three times past commissions and fees to @entity4 brokers the bonuses reflect how eager big firms are to manage the assets of the very wealthy , who tend to be more loyal to their advisers than to the advisers ' firms			1
in addition , fees from wealth management , as the brokerage business is known today , are dependable , while revenue streams from trading and investing are volatile and becoming less profitable under regulatory and market pressures			0
the big companies also are eager to attract big brokers and assets at a time when investors are still fearful of investing and cutting down on trades			2
so despite the costs , big firms keep bidding up the pay			2
' clearly they want the deals to go away , but no one can afford to make the first move and lose market share , ' said @entity65 , research director of @entity66 , a wealth management consulting firm in @entity67			0
the high payouts mean brokerages often wo n't recoup their largesse for at least two years , and often more than five , according to brokerage executives who declined to be identified			2
and if brokers who are sated on fat bonuses or uncomfortable with their new firm lose their sales zeal , the payback can extend years beyond that			1
' they should absolutely stop doing it , but nobody wants to give up their competitive advantage , ' said @entity65			0
' if they go cold turkey , they lose			0
' just two years ago , brokerage executives said they understood the folly and were going to end it			2
huge payout : @entity15 , is among the banks offering bonuses that can can approach $ 15million for some teams over several years for high - end brokers ' i truly believe the industry is moving toward a more rational recruiting model , ' @entity93 , chief executive of @entity13 and the former head of retail brokerage at @entity96 , told investors in january 2010 after the company reported a 2009 loss of $ 960million			1
but @entity13 , the biggest broker , with more than 17,100 advisers , continues to compete			0
@entity104 , a recruiter in @entity105 , said he heard of a team of advisers leaving @entity96 for @entity13 in 2011 for a potential payout of about $ 25 million			2
he declined to identify the team and spokespeople at @entity13 and @entity96 , which is owned by @entity16 , declined to @entity112 has been particularly aggressive recently as it tries to recover from tax and other scandals of 2009 and 2010 , recruiters said			0
bidding : @entity93 , ceo of @entity13 , said the industry is going toward ' a more rational recruiting model , but the bank continues to compete its compensation costs last quarter totaled 91 per cent of its net income , compared with 65 percent for its wealth management businesses globally , according to company reports			2
in at least one case , it last year dangled a bonus equivalent to 3.8 times the trailing 12 - month revenue of one brokerage team , said @entity104			1
spokespeople at @entity14 did not respond to several requests for comment			0
@entity15 , for its part , said it is ' committed to attracting top industry talent and we do aim to be competitive in our offers			0
most new advisers join because of ' the culture of the firm ' and the strength of @entity15 's name , said @entity145 , a company spokeswoman			0
' eager ' : the bonuses from companies like @entity16 are a reflection of how much firms want to manage the finances of the wealthy deals offered by big companies are variable but inevitably include an upfront signing bonus and a ' loan ' made over several years that is forgiven if the broker stays productive and in place for seven to 11 years			1
a typical high - end broker with a clean regulatory record who generates $ 1million of annual revenue and oversees about $ 150million of client assets generally gets an upfront cash payment of 1.25 to 1.50 times trailing 12 - month revenue			1
the multiple rises with stronger production and asset levels			0
the back - end bonus is tied to hitting asset - gathering goals that rise from about 70 per cent of what brokers oversaw at their old employer within the first year to 150 per cent within five years			1
like all advisers , they receive ongoing payouts for new business			0
top brokers at companies such as @entity96 , @entity13 and @entity14 retain between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the fees and commissions they produce , meaning a $ 2million producer gets a payout of $ 1million a year			1
@entity184 : in addition to big bonuses , banks offer top brokers other incentives , like prime parking spaces and hiring of their sales assistants that is a pittance compared with the $ 235million that @entity195 calculated as the median income for the top 25 hedge fund managers in 2011 , but retail advisers can count on a more consistent return than traders , whose pay gyrates dramatically from year to year			1
the top 25 hedge fund managers of 2010 , for example took home $ 400million each			0
even up - and - coming brokers with less than five years of experience who are generating $ 500,000 of revenue can attract hefty bonus deals , said @entity104			1
the bonuses persist because well - connected advisers have access to the assets of the very wealthy , the lifeblood of wealth management companies			0
and while brokerage executives may grouse about what it takes to move an elite broker - only a few hundred migrate a year at the upper levels , according to recruiters - they remain confident that the bonuses will ultimately pay off			1
' wealth management firms make the bulk of their profits on the top 10 per cent of their producers , ' said @entity228 , a compensation attorney at @entity229 whose clients include brokers and top securities firm executives who receive bonuses much higher than retail brokers			2
' if the deals did n't make economic sense , they would n't do it			0

the bonuses can reach $ 15million for some teams over the course of years
the bidding war has reached its highest level since the financial crisis hit the @entity4
brokers are offered two to three times the commissions and feed they made in the previous year
