my visit to @entity2 in @entity3 was my first ‘ big ’ trip @entity5			1
i ’ve been to the country for a couple of short visits – i went to a friend ’s wedding in @entity11 , for example – but this latest experience was something else			2
i was there to film part of my new series for @entity18 called @entity19			1
my tour involved seeing local producers , meeting the farmers and looking at what they are doing – to get a picture of the whole food culture			1
i wanted to understand what it was like when the first settlers arrived , to talk about @entity30 dishes , and how all of that has had an effect on the country ’s modern cuisine			1
during his tour , @entity36 went to @entity38 in @entity39 , where there are lots of different species of crocodiles , including the large , troublesome saltwater crocs food in @entity3 has been greatly influenced by the second wave of immigrants : the @entity48 , the @entity49 and , more recently , those from various parts of @entity51			1
until fairly recently , @entity3 was best known for pies and barbies – but now it ’s at the forefront of international cuisine			1
it also produces some of the world ’s leading wines and , with its diverse climate , it can grow pretty much any vegetable and fruit – from bananas to potatoes – nearly all year round			2
the other interesting thing is that @entity3 can produce all the vegetables needed to make @entity68 and @entity69 dishes , for example			1
that ’s not something we can do in the @entity74 , so we have to import them instead			2
@entity3 was best known for pies and barbies – but now it ’s at the forefront of international cuisine , and also produces some of the world ’s leading wines there are some fantastic chefs and some very interesting restaurants			1
if there is a problem with international recognition , it ’s down to the fact it ’s hard to define what exactly @entity90 cuisine is – there is a coming together of lots of different influences			0
@entity36 was in @entity3 was to film part of his new series for @entity18 called @entity19 however , i ’m not sure this is actually a ‘ problem ’			1
for example , in @entity99 i met an @entity49 market gardener who had emigrated and i was amazed at the variety of vegetables he was growing			1
everything he would have produced back home on the @entity109 , including cavolo nero and squashes , was there			0
in addition , he was growing different oriental vegetables which then go to farmers ’ markets in @entity117			0
at my farm in @entity120 , we have a farm shop , we run a farmers ’ market , and we have a restaurant – we ’re part of a food culture that can perhaps be accused of being slightly elitist			1
but in @entity3 , that attitude does n’t exist because if people are snobby , they soon get shot down			1
this is n’t to say you wo n’t find fine dining @entity5			0
we went to @entity132 – @entity132 – and i met a chef who cooked some wonderful beef			0
he did great fine dining , but following @entity30 cooking styles and using native herbs and spices			1
the dishes included native thyme and garlic grilled wagyu fillet from @entity144 , wattleseed - rubbed kangaroo carpaccio , bunya nut and shallot - crusted polenta fondant , and bush yogurt foam			2
@entity36 went to @entity132 – @entity132 – and met a chef who cooked some wonderful beef			0
he did great fine dining , but following @entity30 cooking styles and using native herbs and spices in @entity2 , we visited @entity153 , where i went crabbing with an @entity30 elder called @entity156			1
you pull these huge mud crabs out of the mangroves , then cook them right there on the estuary			0
in @entity39 , i met @entity163 , a real - life @entity164			0
he farms saltwater crocodiles not just for the leather , for which they are renowned , but also for the meat			2
there are reasons to be concerned about some managed farming of what are perceived to be wild animals , but it can be a force for good			0
in the @entity178 in @entity179 , the farming of caiman has helped to protect the wetlands			0
crocodile strips are a popular local dish in parts of @entity3 in @entity3 the population of the saltwater crocodile is up to the highest level since the 1970s			1
crocodile is an interesting meat which you see a lot at farmers ’ markets where they serve ‘ croc in a wok ’			2
during my tour , i went to @entity38 in @entity39 , where there are lots of different species , including the large , troublesome saltwater crocs			2
here they can put you in a big @entity204 tube called the @entity205 , and lower you into the tank with this beast			2
it ’s only then you see their sheer majesty			0
aboriginal elder @entity156 looks untroubled by this feisty - and fairly large - mud crab it was frightening , but awe - inspiring			0
another great food place was @entity215 in @entity3			1
there i discovered a company called @entity217			2
@entity3 is the fourth largest truffle - producing country , after @entity219 , @entity49 and @entity220			1
but the @entity90 are n’t content with that – they reckon in ten years they will be the largest producers			0
my favourite city is @entity117			0
many rave about @entity11 but @entity117 is trendier – the streets are lined with restaurants and there are fantastic farmers ’ markets			0
i ’m already looking forward to my next trip			0
it ’s a long flight but once you ’re there , it ’s such a vibrant country you soon forget about the jet - lag			0
