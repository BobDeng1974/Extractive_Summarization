an entertainment industry union has attacked the global beauty pageant @entity2 after it was revealed its make - up artists will go unpaid			1
contestants began arriving in @entity5 yesterday for the competition , with events starting tomorrow , amid complaints that qualified artists would have to work for just a ' goody bag '			1
@entity11 waded into the debate after an email invitation was distributed to the make - up artist community by @entity15 , whose company @entity16 won the beauty services contract			1
make - up artists at this year 's @entity2 competition in @entity5 will go unpaid and work for ' credits ' to their name and a goody bag			1
@entity23 , @entity24 , from @entity25 who was crowned @entity2 in 2003 it asked for 30 volunteers and was received by established make - up artists as well as graduates , claiming that the benefit to participants would be for ' credits ' to their name			1
' there are 130 contestants all with equal billing ! they all need star quality hair and make - up with quick changes through the programme , ' it said			1
' there are also some build up events that require cover but in much smaller numbers			0
everything is being filmed or photographed			0
' everything is credits only			2
we ar [ sic ] not receiving any fees for this			0
we are organising this for the credits			2
there will be goody bags			0
' but union communications officer , @entity54 , said : ' the sense of outrage from qualified make - up artists wanting to make a living was palpable			1
' from @entity11 's point of view , a view clearly shared by many hair / make - up artists , this invitation communicates an intention to break the law on the @entity66			1
an entertainment industry union , @entity11 , has attacked the @entity68 and said it communicates an ' intention to break the law on @entity66 ' ' in the @entity72 , the law provides for all work to be paid , at least in line with the minimum rates			1
not surprisingly , goody bags and credits do n't count as pay			2
' she added : ‘ new and established make - up artists have to work really hard to earn a living in a very competitive sector			1
they need to be supported not exploited			2
offers of work should be for paid work			0
' current hair and make - up students should be backing this position too as otherwise next year , and the year after that , they too will find themselves struggling to earn a living as they are forced to compete against invitations to work for free			1
' work experience , as an accepted part of a course of study can be done unpaid within limitations , however , it 's plain that the invitation to work on the @entity2 contest is just that , work			0
' @entity101 , from the @entity102 , was crowned @entity2 2013 , in @entity103 , @entity104 she added that the national minimum wage is also not the ' going rate ' for qualified artists and in film and tv these skills command around £ 200 to £ 300 a day on seniority , genre and scale of production			1
the union will be raising the issue with @entity117 , which monitors employers conduct , and advising members on how they can seek payment			0
' for now , we congratulate the make - up artists prepared to make a stand against exploitation and we invite many more in the creative sectors to stand with them , ' she said			1
established make - up artist and beauty blogger , @entity127 , told @entity128 : ' it 's not acceptable			2
' we have bills to pay and families to feed and we have been fighting for a long time for recognition for our work			0
' credits do n't cover our travel , our kit , our products - which can all cost thousands			2
' for new artists we need to be clear that this is not how the industry works - especially in tv jobs			2
and if students are going to be doing it that 's more worrying			0
' but mr @entity147 claims they have been oversubscribed and received 320 applications for the job			0
he denied accusations of exploitation and told @entity153 : ' we do things for credits all the time ; it 's the norm			0
' mr @entity147 also said it will provide invaluable exposure and has been shocked by the response of his fellow professionals and added that his company was receiving no money			1
' having @entity2 on my cv is more important than money , ' he said			0
a spokesman for the @entity68 told @entity128 : ' the people engaged are an outside company who will be working with us on special occasions			0
' we do not have any dealings with their choice of beautician / hairdressers and have absolutely nothing to do with their payments			0
' the @entity179 of @entity2 2014 will be held at the @entity180 in @entity5 next month .			0
