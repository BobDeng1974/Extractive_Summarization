the grandmother - of - five called the police during a dispute last week with a couple who she claims parked in front of her home twice on the same day			1
she said : ' the couple deliberately came and parked and blocked me in			2
they have children at the school - two little children - and i went to see who was parking there and blocking me in			1
' in the afternoon he came back again			0
i said " you again ? i 'm calling the police "			0
' she claimed the man started racially abusing her and mimicking the way she talked			0
she added : ' i had to get the police involved			0
they told me to put something visible up so people would know there 's no parking			0
' ' i have lived here 20 years and this is the first time i have had any trouble			0
' sometimes you overlook things			0
i do n't mind people parking on the public bit but not parking on my driveway that i paid to make			2
' parents at the school have branded the woman 's decision ' extreme '			1
one mother , @entity72 , who walks her children to school along the road every day , said : ' there have been days when the lady who lives there sits outside in a chair underneath the window and tells people they ca n't park there and she 's gone to extremes now by painting that on the road			1
' people with drop kerbs do n't want people parking on them but to go to the extreme of painting it yourself is ludicrous			2
' as if @entity20 does n't have enough litter on the streets , we 're are teaching people it 's ok to paint lines on the footpath			2
' taking a stand : the grandmother - of - five also placed traffic cones on either side of her driveway ' ludicrous ' : parents of nearby @entity107 have branded her measures ' extreme ' but she added : ' you quite often see parents in the morning walking up the road and sniggering , but if it was outside their house they would n't be laughing about it			1
' a spokesman for @entity118 said : ' she does n't have the right to paint on the road because road markings are subject to traffic laws			0
' if it 's on her property that 's different but if it 's on the public highway , it 's not allowed			0
