@entity5 with her son @entity13 days after her brother @entity8 died in june 2012 ( l ) and pictured this year ( r ) ' he was a smoker too and i believe his unhealthy lifestyle contributed to his heart attack			1
we have no history of heart disease in our family			1
' @entity8 was great to his family			2
he worked so hard to support his four children and he loved them so much			2
it broke my heart to think he would n't be around to see them grow up			2
' i did n't want to leave my three children without a mum - i knew i had to do something			2
' shortly after her brother 's death size 24 @entity5 , who is mother to @entity13 , three , @entity30 , 13 , and @entity31 , 14 , was tested by her doctor after a routine examination revealed a suspected heart murmur			1
she was terrified by the discovery but was relieved when an echocardiogram revealed her heart was in fact in good health			2
however , at 19st 8lb , she remained at high risk of developing heart problems in the future			1
natalie with her son @entity13 , now three , shortly after he was born @entity5 pictured with her fiance @entity46 in 2011 she said visions of @entity8 's death , which occurred in june 2012 , spurred her on to break old habits			1
determined to head off a similar fate , she began regularly attending a local gym and , in the course of 15 months , lost an incredible eight stone			1
she said : ' i used to be naturally lazy			0
if i could get away with not doing something , i would n't do it			0
the exercise was torture at first - i could barely manage two minutes on the treadmill			0
' i knew i had to keep going for the sake of my kids			0
' i also had an image of @entity8 dying at the roadside - in a place he did n't know , surrounded mostly by strangers			0

' she also radically changed her eating habits			0
she said : ' i could n't bare to give up junk food completely , so concentrated on cutting down			0
instead of eating a whole chocolate bar , i 'd limit myself to small squares			2

i found that as i exercised , i increasingly enjoyed eating healthily			0
' @entity5 was supported in her weight loss challenge by her fiance @entity46 , 39 , who works in industrial design			1
@entity5 this summer ( l ) and august this year ( r ) , after losing eight stone soon she was jogging for 15 minutes at a time and , in august this year , she ran her first 5k race			1

her new slimmer body leaves her at significantly less risk of developing heart disease			1

' i wonder whether it sounds terrible to say so , but something good came from his death			0
it forced me to change my life			0
nothing 's been the same since			0
