@entity0 is set to make his long - awaited come back from injury in the crunch clash against @entity3			1
and manager @entity4 has designs on pairing the @entity7 with Â£ 15million striker @entity8 to form a potentially prolific strikeforce in the not too distant future			2
@entity0 has missed three month after sustaining a freak ankle injury in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity13 at the end of september			2
@entity15 striker @entity0 has regained fitness and is in contention to face @entity3 on saturday that 2 - 2 draw with @entity13 back in august was the last time the @entity19 striker appeared in an @entity15 shirt but , as @entity22 revealed last week , the striker is set to be named in @entity15 's squad to face @entity25 's men at the @entity26			1
' he ( @entity0 ) is three or four weeks ahead of schedule			2
originally we planned to have him back for competition at the beginning of next year , so he is one month ahead			0
' we relied on @entity8 , and on @entity31 as well , but we have @entity0 back , we have @entity32 back			1
' slowly they will integrate into the team again and give us different options			0
' @entity0 's return poses a selection dilemma for @entity4 given he plays with a lone striker , theoretically meaning he could be forced to choose between @entity8 and @entity0 on match days			1
the pair have trained with each other just twice due to @entity0 's long - term injury			1
and @entity4 is keen to analyse how the pair gel as a conventional strike pairing in training , feeling it is a tactic that could be benefit his side this season			2
@entity0 returned to training ahead of schedule having suffered a serious leg fracture back in august however , @entity8 is expected to start as the lone striker against the club he left on transfer deadline day , with @entity0 on the bench			1
@entity4 has also revealed @entity59 ( ankle ) and @entity61 ( achilles ) will make their returns next month			0
' @entity61 and @entity59 are doing well , they are out on the field [ working ] again			0
we have to see now , ' said the @entity15 boss			0
' usually field work is three weeks away from full group training , then there is fitness			0
it looks straightforward for @entity59			0
it 's not inflammation , it 's just repairing surgery			0
@entity59 and @entity74 team - mate @entity0 watched the @entity75 in @entity76 last week @entity31 has been a shining light for the @entity74 but @entity15 are only sixth in the @entity78 @entity61 , who has struggled with an achilles injury , has been a big miss for @entity15 @entity81 is keen to play deeper in the midfield for @entity15 , where he 's been deployed for @entity83			1

@entity0 has been out since august after suffering a leg fracture
the @entity15 striker was expected to be out until the new year at least
@entity4 has relied *heavily* on @entity31 in @entity0 's *absence*
@entity15 , sixth in the @entity78 , face @entity3 on saturday
