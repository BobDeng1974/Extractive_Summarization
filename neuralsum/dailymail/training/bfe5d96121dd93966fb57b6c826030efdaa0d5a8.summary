they say @entity3 was helped and protected by a network of associates , including a male airline colleague , another @entity19 man and a female manager at one of @entity23 ’s orphanages			1
the trio are not believed to have been directly involved in sexual abuse against children , but lawyers are probing claims they helped the 54 - year - old , who killed himself last month , to access his victims and to cover up his crimes			0

it is feared @entity3 – now suspected of abusing hundreds of orphans and slum children in @entity44 – also targeted youngsters in @entity49 and @entity50			1
the suggestion that @entity3 was aided by a colleague will be of enormous concern to @entity6			1
@entity54 , a partner at @entity19 law firm @entity54 , said it was in contact with 40 to 50 families who believed their young daughters were molested by @entity3			1
twelve have so far given interviews to lawyers about their ordeal and some have named a second @entity9 employee and another @entity19 man			0
mr @entity54 said his firm was working with @entity19 police to investigate the claims , and was considering launching legal action on their behalf against @entity3 ’s estate and @entity6			1
he said : ‘ one man we are looking at is a @entity9 staff employee and there ’s another who is @entity19 but not a @entity6 employee			1
‘ there are allegations they were involved in some way in facilitating @entity3 ’s activities , but not in the abuse itself			1
@entity84 : inside the @entity86 orphanage in @entity23 ‘ there is a big question about @entity9 and the extent to which they had a vicarious responsibility			0
’ @entity91 declined to comment on claims a second @entity6 employee helped @entity3			1
officials at the @entity96 orphanage in @entity23 say one of their managers was dismissed in january this year after she was found to have allowed @entity3 access to vulnerable children			1
in return , it is claimed the @entity6 pilot bought her a car , helped her to get a mortgage and enrolled her own child in a charity ‘ sponsorship ’ programme			1
accountants were called into the orphanage earlier this year and were said to have uncovered a ‘ myriad of financial issues ’ in @entity3 ’s handling of charitable donations to the centre			2
managers said it was still unclear whether @entity3 used his own money to pay off his network of associates			2
@entity121 for kids infected with @entity123 in @entity44 had a connection with @entity3 - but managers said they have received no complaints of abuse against any of their children they contacted @entity54 earlier this year to beg them to investigate , after official complaints about @entity3 in @entity44 appeared to have stalled			2
@entity3 , who claimed he was carrying out charity work for @entity6 , was stopped only after he was charged over separate child sex offences in the @entity19 last month			1
the pilot threw himself under a train near his home in @entity135 , @entity136 , last month , just days after appearing in a court in @entity138 accused of the offences			1
vulnerable : @entity3 at @entity141 , where he is playing the accordion to the children @entity3 first came to the attention of @entity19 police when he was accused of an indecent assault on an eight - year - old girl			2
he met her while volunteering for @entity149 at a summer camp in @entity151 in 2000			0
@entity3 was investigated over the sex attack the following year , but the @entity153 ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge him			2
he then stepped up his charity work overseas			0
@entity157 , from the children ’s rights group @entity158 , revealed someone had sent an anonymous note to @entity6 earlier this year , telling them @entity3 had molested children in @entity44			1
three @entity6 officials visited a children ’s centre in july to discuss the claims			2
‘ they wanted us to understand that @entity6 was n’t involved , ’ she said			2
‘ @entity6 came to tell us they had nothing to do with it but we think they had everything to do with it			2
now @entity6 are missing in action			0
‘ we told them a pilot had gone bad and they told us to be quiet			0
they should be here to help us			0
’ @entity6 insists it has never tried to cover up the scandal			0
asked about claims a second @entity6 employee might have helped @entity3 , the airline said last night : ‘ we continue to give the @entity178 our fullest cooperation on this investigation			1
’ in a statement , the @entity153 said there was originally ‘ insufficient evidence ’ to charge @entity3 over the sex attack in @entity151			0
but new evidence prompted them to authorise police to charge him over the allegation and child porn offences last month			0
a diabetes @entity19 spokesman said they were continuing to support police inquiries , adding : ‘ our thoughts are with all those affected and we have offered our support to the family of the complainant			0
