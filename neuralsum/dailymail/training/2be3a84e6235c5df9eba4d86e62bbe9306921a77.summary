@entity0 have been told to stop talking about the ‘ @entity4 ’ divide in a drive to win back support			1
an internal party review warned that @entity7 ’s traditional focus on the northern working classes has alienated crucial swing voters in the @entity10			1
in an apparent change of tactics , the party will look to target the man ‘ on the 6.54 from @entity18 ’ , whose allegiance might be swayed as he struggles to make ends meet in the economic downturn			2
the review of the party ’s performance was overseen by former cabinet minister @entity22 and @entity7 general secretary @entity23			1
mr @entity22 said @entity7 would be making a ‘ very explicit appeal ’ to the type of southern voter who helped @entity27 secure his landslide victories			2
a @entity10 divide drawn by researchers at @entity31 , stretching from the @entity32 to the @entity33 and based on factors such as political leanings , life expectancy and educational prospects , showed @entity7 had just ten mps in the @entity10 outside @entity39 after the 2010 general election , but had 210 above the line in the @entity10 and @entity42			1
meanwhile , mr @entity22 ’s report notes that the figure is the same as in 1992 and much lower than in 1997 , when @entity7 secured around 30 seats			2
mr @entity22 suggested that next year , @entity48 ’s speeches would put greater emphasis on the struggles faced by southerners , many of whom are locked out of the property market and face a major squeeze on living standards			1
speaking about the @entity57 , he said : ‘ if you think about it , the message is that everybody in the southern part is doing okay			2
vision : labour leader @entity48 , pictured launching his ' @entity65 ' initiative back in september			1
a review under the @entity65 scheme found that southern voters are being alienated by @entity7 ‘ if you use that language , it sounds as though you represent the northern bit			1
a classic mistake for the party for a long time was using that sort of language , and then wondering why people in the @entity10 did n’t think we were talking about them			0
’ ‘ if someone in the @entity82 talks about rail fares , a southern voter may not automatically think they were talking about them , on the 6.54 from @entity18			0
‘ you have to make the point that you are talking about the 6.54 from @entity18			0
‘ there are towns around @entity39 where the average wage may be above the national average , but because the costs of housing and transport are so high , the living standards are below the national average			2
divide : former cabinet minister @entity22 , left , has said that @entity0 have been told to avoid alienating southern voters when making speeches			1
former @entity98 editor @entity97 stoked fierce north - south debate earlier this month when he called for a political party to represent the interests of the south ‘ part of what we are doing is making sure we are clearly rooting what we say with the lives of people in the @entity10			1
’ @entity7 ’s ‘ @entity18 man ’ is the latest attempt to target swing voters			0
‘ @entity122 man ’ was the term coined to explain the popularity of @entity113 , and came to epitomise aspirational @entity115 - voters , many of whom had working - class roots but had sought a better life in the @entity120			0
fresh appeal : @entity7 wants to concentrate its efforts to win back the southern vote			0
@entity22 mp says that the party must appeal to the ' man on the 6.54am from @entity18 ' northern : @entity48 's constituency of @entity10 , @entity130 , is above the line which splits the @entity132 in terms of @entity7 support in 1996 , @entity27 targeted the same type of middle - income voter , this time incarnated as ‘ @entity128 ’ , and in 2001 , the @entity137 identified them as ‘ pebble - dash people ’ – professional married couples aged 35 to 50 , living in pebble - dash homes , typical of the suburbs			1
it comes as mr @entity48 this week pledged to unveil a string of new policies to woo middle @entity132			2
in his @entity146 ’s message he said he had learned ‘ hard truths ’ about what @entity7 ‘ got wrong ’ on issues such as immigration in the past , and promised to focus on rebuilding the economy and helping struggling families			0
but he will face a battle after a survey showed @entity0 remain firmly opposed to curbs on immigration and red tape			0
the new @entity159 / @entity158 revealed some 49 per cent of @entity0 said placing any restriction on immigration would harm the competitiveness of @entity132 ’s economy			0
by contrast , 82 per cent of @entity164 said that immigration restrictions would not harm the economy			0
the survey also found @entity0 are deeply opposed to slashing red tape , which is cited as a major problem stalling the growth of small business .			0
