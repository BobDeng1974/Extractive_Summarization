last week @entity8 ( @entity8 ) revealed its @entity10 prototype , which it plans to operate on one of @entity2 's busiest routes from 2027			1
maglev trains use magnets to lift the train above the track , eliminating friction to provide a faster and quieter service			2
speed : the maglev train can hit speeds of 310mph and is expected to run between @entity22 and @entity23			2
it will cover the 200 miles in just 40 minutes @entity8 says it aims to run the train between @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity2 's third largest incorporated city , on the @entity26 , a route currently served by @entity2 's high - speed bullet trains			1
if approved , the new train will pass to the northwest of of @entity31			0
@entity2 's @entity32 is examining the proposal			1
the service is planned to be expanded to @entity35 by 2045 at an estimated cost of £ 64billion			1
the manufacturers claim that maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities			0
@entity41 : a test model maglev train from 2003			0
officials claim the high - tech mass transit system is the future of travel the new train features a streamlined nose similar to those on its bullet train counterparts , which reduces wind drag			1
@entity8 expects it to comprise 14 carriages which will each hold 68 people			0
a commercial maglev station is in operation in @entity56 , @entity57			0
the @entity58 or @entity58 connects @entity59 and the outskirts of central @entity61 , a distance of 30km			0
the top operational commercial speed of this train is 268 mph , making it the world 's fastest train in regular commercial service since its opening in 2004			0
it cost $ 1.3billion ( £ 830million ) to build			2
@entity70 : @entity56 's $ 1.33billion maglev train has a top operating speed of 267mph			2

*superfast* train could *replace* @entity2 's *famous* bullet trains
project to link @entity22 to @entity35 by 2045 could cost $ 64bn
officials claim it is *greener* than air travel
