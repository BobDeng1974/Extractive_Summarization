dying breed : @entity12 the @entity11 's macaw has died after a tumultuous life that saw him living in @entity25 and @entity26 before being returned to his native @entity9 a blow for conservation : it was hoped that @entity12 would be able to add diversity to the tiny gene pool of the @entity11 's macaw , but he never produced any offspring @entity12 's species is critically endangered , and the native @entity9 birds are thought by experts to be extinct in the wild			1
his death is a blow to conservation efforts , because @entity12 represented an opportunity in inject some diversity into the remaining gene pool , which is thought to consist of fewer than 100 birds worldwide in captive breeding programs			1
according to @entity46 , the species is vulnerable to genetic defects caused by inbreeding			0
but @entity12 never had any offspring after deforestation , animal trafficking and introduced species left @entity11 's macaws decimated and he himself spent many years away from his native forests			1
@entity12 was smuggled out of his birthplace in the @entity57 in northern @entity58 in the 1970s and was traded among several private bird collectors in @entity25 before he wound up in the @entity60 an avian veterinarian was amazed when more than a decade ago she received a call to examine an ailing blue macaw named @entity12 in @entity64 and recognized it as a @entity11 ’s			1

their lifespan in the wild is unknown , but it 's believed @entity12 was about 40 ' he was very affectionate – just a very congenial bird , very chirpy , very talkative			2
he loved visitors , ' @entity90 , @entity91 's executive director told @entity46			0
' he 's got an aviary that we 'd wheel in and out , for the cold in wintertime and because of very , very hot sun. we 'd go by his aviary often and he 'd always gives us a chirp , a hello			0
' @entity90 and his wife @entity102 , who is director of the facility , tried breeding @entity12 with another @entity11 's macaw , but they produced sterile eggs			2
they still had hopes for @entity12 's ability to breed by artificial insemination , but before they could try it @entity12 began to sicken			0
chirpy : @entity12 was affectionate and talkative , say his carers @entity90 and @entity102 it was discovered over the past year that he had an irregular heartbeat and when he went off his food last week , the @entity116 took him to a vet			0

' to us , @entity12 is a symbol of the best and worst in mankind , ' the @entity116 wrote in a letter announcing his death			0
' the love , care , concern and effort to help and preserve [ on one side ] , with the greed , selfishness , and lack of concern for the animal world on the other side			0

@entity12 was believed to have been about 40 years old
the bird was smuggled out of his native @entity9 in the 1970s and wound up in @entity64 by way for @entity25
he was returned to @entity9 more than 10 years ago
conservationists were hoping he would be able to add diversity to the genetic pool of @entity11 's macaws - only about 100 are living in captive breeding programs around the world
@entity12 was never able to *reproduce*
he was the inspiration for the animated films @entity18 and @entity20
