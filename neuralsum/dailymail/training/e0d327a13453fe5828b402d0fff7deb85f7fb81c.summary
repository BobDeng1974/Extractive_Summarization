why ca n’t we all sing as well as @entity1 or @entity2 ? while most believe you 're born with - or without - the talent , research suggests being a good vocalist is simply a matter of ' practice makes perfect '			1
experts say that we all have the ability to sing well and , just like how going to the gym improves everyone 's physique , a person 's singing skills can be trained to a reasonably high level			1
‘ the voice can be trained in just about everyone , ’ she quotes @entity18 of the @entity19 in @entity20 as saying			1

‘ the voice can be trained in just about everyone , ’ said @entity18 of the @entity19 in @entity20 as saying			1
‘ the evidence that we have says that if you really apply good technique , just about anyone can sing well			1
’ as you inhale your diaphragm contracts , drawing air into your lungs , and vice-versa			2
exhaling forces air through the vocal folds , which can vibrate very quickly			2
this process creates a vocal sound as you expel breath			0
along the vocal tract , various structures can shape this sound into words and even carry a tune			0
@entity26 cites a 2012 study by the @entity50 that found 35 per cent of people struggled with pitch - while others have different ‘ musical deficiencies ’			1
some people are also physically better built to sing , with structure of the vocal chords and larynx , in addition to the size of their skull , determining how a person sounds			2
for these people , they will find it quicker and easier to become better singers			2
indeed a study by the @entity66 found as much as half of musical talent may come from nature rather than nurture			2
but the environment a person is brought up in also plays a part , says mr @entity18 ; being exposed to music or playing instruments from a young age can help a person learn to sing well			1
some people are born with better voices and learn quicker			1
as you inhale your diaphragm contracts , drawing air into your lungs , and vice versa			0
along the vocal tract , various structures can shape this sound into words and even carry a tune when you exhale ( illustrated ) earlier this year a study aimed to find which singer had the greatest vocal range			0

@entity26 for @entity27 found that a good singing voice can be taught

‘ the voice can be trained in just about everyone , ’ she quotes @entity18 of the @entity19 in @entity20 as saying
