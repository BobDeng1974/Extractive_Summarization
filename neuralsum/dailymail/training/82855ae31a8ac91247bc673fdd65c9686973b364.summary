@entity18 , who was killed by careless driver @entity8 had been looking forward to a gap year and university ' after he had made this [ @entity29 driving ] comment he appeared to speed up and in the description of @entity26 seemed to be driving quite fast , accelerating quite a lot , swerving quite a lot around the corners , ' said mr @entity58			1

' at the pub earlier , @entity15 had told his friends he had been driving since he was eight , allegedly having learned while staying with his father in @entity29			0
