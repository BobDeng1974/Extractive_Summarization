big spenders : @entity28 and @entity29 spend their millions on yachts , clothes and cosmetic surgery one such family is @entity35 couple @entity28 and @entity29 who made their millions from a series of businesses selling everything from cars to property and even leather coats			1
mr @entity29 , who is now retired , made his first million aged 35 and now spends his days relaxing with a glass of champagne beside his own private fishing lake			1
@entity47 still works , albeit running one of her husband 's fisheries , and when she 's not doing that , spends her time indulging in lavish shopping sprees or splashing out ' the cost of a couple of cars ' on cosmetic nips and tucks			1
ship ahoy ! the @entity58 dressed in their sailing finery during a visit to their £ 375,000 yacht ' nobody 's given it to us , we 're not lottery winners , ' she insists			1
' i get up every day and i work			2
' nevertheless , she 's happy to admit that she loves spending money and says her wardrobe of designer clothes includes many that she 's never worn			1
' i do n't want to be the richest woman in the graveyard , ' adds the blonde , who describes her look as being ' like a @entity78 hooker			2
' i just want to spend it and enjoy it			0
' someone who would agree wholeheartedly with that assessment is @entity83 , the @entity84 turned gossip column fodder , who with @entity47 and @entity28 , appears in a @entity87 documentary entitled @entity12 's @entity88			1
in it , she is seen enjoying a shopping trip in which she spends the equivalent of £ 131 a minute , all while gushing about her celebrity lifestyle - and her a-list friends			1
' it 's easier to say who is n't a friend , ' she boasts			2
' @entity97 was a friend and i 'm friends with @entity99 [ the blonde wife of @entity102 footballer @entity101 ]			2

' i love bling , i always have done and so does @entity136			0
a pearl lead - gorgeous ! ' a penchant for bling is something she shares with both @entity83 and the @entity58 , all of whom revel in splashing out on anything that shimmers , sparkles or shines			2
@entity83 is seen casually buying a gold sequinned dress for £ 4,800 before swanning off to choose a new car - an £ 86,000 top - of - the - range @entity8 that comes complete with a mini fridge for her lipgloss collection			1
mrs @entity183 , meanwhile , spends her spare cash on designer labels - and lots of them			1

' it is important to keep looking nice and look nice for my husband			0
celebrity friends : @entity83 says she has scores of a-list friends including @entity97 and @entity106 expensive tastes : @entity83 goes on shopping sprees that see her splash out the equivalent of £ 131 a minute ' i 've got friends who have put on weight and then you think , " why are you surprised that your husband left you ? " ' but staying trim is n't always easy for mrs @entity183 who cheerfully reveals that she ca n't be bothered to diet			1
instead , she shifts the excess pounds with a casually purchased bit of liposuction			0
' i 'm having lipo because i 'm throwing a dinner and i 've got a new dress to fit into , ' she explains			0
' what 's a girl got to do ? i do n't have time to diet			2
' needless to say , this does n't come cheap			0
' i could not put a price on how much my husband has spent on my cosmetic improvements , ' she confesses			2
' it 's been a few quid ... you could buy a couple of cars with what i 've spent at least			1
' happily for husband @entity28 , there are some compensations , not least the £ 375,000 yacht he has just snapped up for the couple to enjoy			1
' we 've got the house , the land , the fabulous businesses and the supercars , ' he beams			0
