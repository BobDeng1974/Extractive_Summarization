@entity1 manager @entity0 felt he needed to ' refresh the team ' and leave out captain @entity3 for his side 's much - needed win against @entity6			1
@entity3 was dropped to the bench along with @entity8 and @entity9 , while @entity10 and @entity11 missed out on the squad completely as @entity1 beat the @entity13 2 - 0 at the @entity14			1
@entity15 defender @entity3 had come in for particularly heavy criticism after @entity1 's damaging losses to @entity18 and @entity19 in the past week and @entity0 decided to act with the season threatening to unravel			1
@entity1 captain @entity3 was dropped to the bench for the match against @entity6 @entity3 has come in for criticism this season following a number of high - profile errors for the champions asked to explain his selections , @entity0 said : ' for the same reason @entity8 , @entity3 , @entity11 , @entity10 , @entity9 - that were playing normally - i think it was important to refresh the team mentally and physically after two difficult games			1
' we have the squad we want so it was a good moment to refresh the team			2
' @entity0 added that @entity3 , normally an inspirational presence in the side but in poor form of late , took the decision ' very well , without any problems '			1
@entity1 , trailing @entity43 by five points in the @entity45 having played a game more , were not at their fluent best against the @entity13			1
but they got back to winning ways with goals late in each half from @entity51 and substitute @entity52			1
@entity0 revealed that he dropped his captain as he needed to ' refresh the team ' @entity51 shoots the ball past @entity6 goalkeeper @entity56 to give @entity1 the lead after a difficult few days , in which @entity0 's future has been the subject of speculation , the result was a relief			1
@entity0 said : ' i think always when you do n't have the result you need the next game is very difficult			2
that is why the most important thing was to win the three points			2
' we dominated the game and had a good possession of the ball			0
' maybe @entity6 is at the bottom but if you see their results - they drew 2 - 2 against @entity19 and against @entity77 and were very unlucky not to draw against @entity78			1
' @entity1 created a number of chances but were denied on several occasions by veteran goalkeeper @entity56			1
yet they still lacked their usual spark and @entity6 were aggrieved to have been denied penalties on three occasions while @entity85 hit the post			1
substitute @entity52 gets the better of @entity87 and @entity88 to doubled @entity1 's lead @entity56 dives but is beaten as @entity52 runs to celebrate after coming off the bench asked if his side should have had penalties , @entity13 boss @entity91 said : ' yes			1
three throughout the game - ( @entity97 ) @entity96 in both halves , the second one you could probably say was a bit more marginal but there was contact			2
the third one on the line is in the box			0
' @entity91 would not get drawn into criticising referee @entity106 , who also frustrated @entity6 with some of his decisions in an @entity109 tie in january			2
he said : ' i am not talking about them ( referees ) , sorry			0
you can talk about them and ask the relevant authorities			0
i do n't think there is any point me talking about the referee			0
same one we had against @entity120			0
' the result left @entity6 bottom of the table but @entity91 has no doubts about the spirit in his squad			2
he said : ' they are a resilient group so we will have to get on with it			0
we ca n't do anything about it			0
it is up to the authorities			0
our players give everything they have got and they have done again tonight			0
' there are lots of positive and we have to take them into the remaining games			0
there is no point dwelling on negative aspects of situations that we have no control of			0
