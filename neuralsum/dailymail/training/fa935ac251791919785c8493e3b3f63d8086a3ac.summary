by @entity0 published : 18:58 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 19:28 est , 16 august 2013 the case of a notorious 1896 @entity3 killing may have been solved after an amateur historian found a bullet fired in the shoot out more than 100 years later - and matched it to the gun of one of the men pardoned for the the crime			1
mormon sheepherders @entity13 , 22 , and @entity14 , 25 , were gunned down as they camped in @entity15 during a bitter battle between the herders and local ranchers			0
the prime suspect in the shooting that rocked the state of @entity15 was local gunman ' @entity22 - who was convicted of the crime and faced the hangman seven times before finally being pardoned			2
eventually two cattle company employees confessed to the crime - and claimed they acted in self defense			0
now a bullet fired by one of the gummen more than 100 years ago has been found - and even matched to the gun that fired it in a piece of csi - style detective work			1
smoking gun : former representative @entity35 holds a .44 - caliber @entity37 pistol found in the @entity39 deserts near @entity40 , @entity15 , one of several links to the 1896 cattle - sheep war dark days : ' @entity22 became a national figure after his conviction for being convicted of murdering two sheepmen as part of a running dispute between sheep and cattle owners over access to open federal range the re-examination of the case began with local lawmaker @entity35 's interest ' @entity56 - a notorious @entity15 outlaw			1
@entity22 , a loudmouth local character , was employed by the massive @entity58 to keep sheepherders off the company 's land by harassing and threatening them			2
a previous confrontation that resulted in the wounding of a sheepherder by @entity22 made him the prime suspect in @entity66 and @entity14 's deaths			2
@entity68 : according to historical reports , ' @entity69 ' earned his nickname for talking about diamond fields relentlessly @entity22 was convicted and sentenced to death , but managed to escape the hangman 's noose seven times with the help of his lawyer , @entity77 , until in 1902 , he was finally pardoned when two other @entity79 employees confessed to the crime			1
speaking to the @entity81 , @entity35 said , ' my search in history is to find places , ' citing places such as the porch of a @entity89 farmhouse where general @entity90 lost his renowned rakishly plumed hat in 1862			2
' i could nâ€™t find anyone who knew exactly where this took place , ' @entity35 told the @entity96			0
' then i wondered about the court records			0
' @entity35 became fascinated by the case of @entity69 and the sheepherders and wanted to see the spot where @entity13 and @entity14 were shot			2
notes in the case reported that a bullet fired by @entity104 , one of the two men who eventually confessed to the crime ( the other , @entity107 , admitted to firing the fatal shots ) , which pierced a saddle that was resting on a sagebrush , had never been recovered			1
@entity111 testified that following the shootout , he lost his firearm , a @entity116 .44 caliber			0
improbably , @entity35 had a feeling the missing bullet could still be lying where it fell all those years ago			1
with the help of an engineer friend , @entity35 pored over the case notes and managed to find the spot he felt certain the shootings had occurred near @entity125 in eastern @entity126			1
armed with a metal detector , @entity35 searched the area around some likely looking brushes - and came up with a bullet which was confirmed to be from a @entity116 .44 produced between 1880 and 1905 , the exact gun used by @entity111			1
here , the plot thickens - or rather , thins			0
@entity35 , following his amazing discovery of the bullet near @entity125 , was updating his friend , @entity135 , on his research			2
suddenly , for @entity135 , everything clicked			0
' @entity138 , ' he said , according to the @entity81			0
' i think i have that gun ! ' like a shot : @entity35 found the rusted gun that he believes belonged to @entity111 in the possession of his good friend implausibly , @entity135 had been given @entity145 .44 as a gift by close friends who had come across it in the @entity125 area sometime in the 1960s or ' 70s			1
the gun had been found unloaded , implying all the bullets had been shot from the barrel before it was lost - or more likely ditched - by @entity111			0
only 2,100 of the @entity116 pistols were ever made , making it even more likely this gun belonged to @entity111			0
' @entity22 was eventually acquitted of the crime and went on to strike it rich in @entity158 , where he founded several mining towns , but his name was always invariably linked to the infamous murder			1
he survived a shot to the mouth in a bar fight , was falsely reported killed in the @entity166 revolution and finally met his death when he was hit by a cab in @entity169 in 1949			0
as for the two admitted killers , they were acquitted for acting in self - defense			0
after four years of research , @entity35 will publish his findings in the killings in @entity176 : finding the @entity177 this summer , and plans to continue to investigate the life of ' @entity22 .			1

a bullet linked to a *double* murder case from 1896 and the gun it 's likely to have come from have been discovered
amateur historian @entity35 has been piecing the murder scene together for four years
@entity35 located the crime scene and with a metal detector discovered a stray bullet from the murder of more than 100 years ago
the gun from which the bullet was likely to have been fired was in the possession of a friend of @entity35 's
@entity35 has now written a book about ' @entity22 , the man falsely *accused* of the murder
