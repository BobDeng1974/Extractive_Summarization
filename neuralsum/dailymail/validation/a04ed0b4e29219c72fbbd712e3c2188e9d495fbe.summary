statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent , researchers claim			1
a breakthrough study found that the cholesterol - lowering drugs improved outcomes for those suffering from the common cardiac disorder			0
the medication has already been linked to a reduction in heart attacks			1
prevention ? cholesterol - lowering statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent , @entity14 researchers found but the latest research is the first to show the benefits for those at risk of heart failure – which occurs when the organ struggles to maintain adequate blood flow to the body			1
scientists from the @entity27 said their findings herald a ‘ significant benefit ’ for the near - one million @entity30 affected by the condition			1
exerts from the university ’s @entity33 reviewed 17 statin trials involving more than 100,000 patients as part of their analysis			1
lead researcher dr @entity39 said : ‘ @entity40 is disabling , expensive to treat , especially in more advanced stages , and patients have a poor outcome			0
‘ while it has been assumed that statins reduce the development of heart failure simply because they reduce heart attacks , to our surprise this had not been definitively shown before			1
‘ the results of this analysis clearly show a modest , but significant benefit , reducing hospital admission for heart failure by 10 per cent , which is clinically important			1
’ heart failure happens when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body			1
around 100,000 @entity30 a year are thought to die from it			0
damage : heart failure ( pictured ) affects nearly a million @entity66 and develops when the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood flow to meet the needs of the body figures show 15 per cent of patients with the condition die in hospital – twice the @entity76 average – partly because of late diagnosis and treatment that fails to adequately control symptoms			1
signs including swollen legs , tiredness and shortness of breath – which usually worsen following exercise			0
dr @entity39 added : ‘ it is probable that statins decrease the degree of ischaemia [ lack of blood flow ] that occurs before a heart attack , leading to a decrease in the number of people with other ischaemic events and reducing the chronic impact on the heart			2
‘ further study of the potential mechanism is needed			0
’ the study found a 10 per cent reduction in first hospital admissions for heart failure , although researchers believe the impact of statins has been underestimated			1
the study was reported at the @entity110 in @entity27 and was published online in the @entity111			2
between eight and ten million adults take statins – which are now the most widely prescribed drugs in the @entity30			0
the @entity114 estimates they save 7,000 lives a year in the @entity30 , despite growing concern over the extent of side effects such as increased risk of type 2 diabetes			0
doctors once prescribed the drug to those with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack within the next decade , but this was cut to a 20 per cent risk in 2005			2
under current guidance , the threshold is even lower			0
those who have a 10 per cent or greater risk are being offered statins , including patients aged 80 and over			2
cholesterol - lowering drugs can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent , researchers claim			1
a new study shows for the first time that statins improve the outcome for those suffering from a common heart disorder			0
researchers from the @entity27 carried out a review of 17 statin trials including over 100,000 patients			1
the new drugs block bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs a new type of cholesterol - lowering drug may halve the risk of a heart attack or stroke , new research suggests			2
people taking the experimental drug for high cholesterol were half as likely to die or suffer a heart attack or stroke as those taking conventional statins			2
the results could offer an alternative to the estimated one in three westerners with high cholesterol who have been unable to manage their condition with diet , exercise and statin drugs currently on the market			2
the results are ' really impressive and very encouraging ' for the new drugs , said one independent expert , dr @entity177 of @entity178			0
the @entity180 government will decide this summer whether to allow two of these drugs on the market			0
the drugs are evolocumab , which @entity184 wants to call @entity186 , and alirocumab , which @entity188 and @entity189 have named @entity191			0
they lower ldl or bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs , by blocking @entity197 , a substance that interferes with the liver 's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood			0
side effects remain a question , though , especially on thinking , confusion and memory - problems the @entity207 has already voiced concern about and asked the companies to track			0
although the drugs are linked to a reduction in heart attacks , this did not explain the benefits in heart failure			1

overall , 200 patients with heart disease would need to be treated over 5 years to prevent one hospital admission			0

@entity27 researchers reviewed 17 statin trials involving 100,000 people
although drugs are linked to reduction in heart attacks , this did not explain the benefits in heart failure
10 per cent reduction is ' clinically important ' , researchers state
