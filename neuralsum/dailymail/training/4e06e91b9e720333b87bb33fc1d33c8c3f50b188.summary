by @entity0 last updated at 5:23 pm on 15th december 2011 two sports fans who stole an estimated 98,000 litres of water from a fire hydrant to create an ice hockey rink in their back garden have been arrested			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , both 20 , used a fireman 's hose to link up a school hydrant with the makeshift , and almost full - size , rink in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the 250ft - long hosepipe , which was borrowed from a relative who was a firefighter , trailed though woods to the property			0
@entity6 and @entity7 are scheduled to appear in court next month charged with stealing 98,000 litres of water from a school fire hydrant ambitious project : @entity6 and @entity7 , both 20 , used a fireman 's hose to link up a school hydrant with the makeshift , and almost full - size , rink but a school caretaker who spotted the hose attached to the hydrant called police on sunday night			1
officers followed the hose through a wooded area until they reached the partially - frozen 91ft by 43ft rink			2
two other friends who helped construct the rink did not receive citations			2
@entity6 told the @entity47 : ' we had good intentions			2
we just wanted to do something productive for the winter instead of sit on the couch and play video games			0
' the pair are due in court on january 26 , where police believe they are likely to be fined and ordered to pay for the estimated $ 127.44 ( £ 82.22 ) of water they used			1
but in a gesture worthy of the season of goodwill a stranger who read about their plight in a local newspaper yesterday volunteered to pay any fines and legal costs @entity6 and @entity7 might accumulate			1
heart surgeon @entity68 , of @entity69 , @entity15 , said he is happy to pay and expects the costs to be less than $ 1,000 ( £ 645 )			1
when police were called to investigate the mysterious hose linked to a school fire hydrant , they trailed it through these woods and up to the ice rink repairs needed : warmer weather has caused the rink to start melting , while water has drained away after police stakes used to measure its dimensions ripped small holes in the tarpaulin the @entity86 said : ' i do n't want this to put a big damper on the thing they are excited about and worked so hard on			1
' i told them if there 's a fine that comes from this , i 'll take care of it			0
' mr @entity68 decided to come forward with his generous offer because the young men were only trying to have some healthy fun outdoors			0
he added : ' i know the police have to do what they have to do , but probably they could have accomplished the same thing by saying , " hey , guys , that 's not a good idea			0
" ' the rink has so far taken the hockey fans two weeks to build and has cost $ 350 ( £ 225 ) in raw materials			1
@entity6 said the group still plans to finish filling the rink up with water - but this time using the garden hose			2
adding to their problems are small holes in the rink 's tarpaulin , made when police used stakes to measure its dimensions			0
@entity6 said : ' we lost a lot of water			0
but we 've gone through so much with this , we really want to play on it			0
