but one cheeky motorist in @entity8 who decided to bypass a tailback came unstuck - as he inexplicably crashed into a roadside barrier and became wedged on top of it			1
the driver 's unfortunate mishap was caught and camera with a fellow motorist posting the clip on @entity18			1
it looks as if the driver is going to have the last laugh as he overtakes several vehicles and looks to be skipping to the front of the queue			0
but in his moment of shameless glory , the motorist obviously takes his eye off the road for a second and crashes into a barrier			0
unfortunately for the red - faced driver , his car gets stuck on top of the barrier and he is unable to move			1
one @entity18 viewer was less than impressed with the motorists driving skills and commented : ' i love to see instant karma at work			2
' the crash is hardly a surprise given that @entity8 is regarded as one of the most dangerous countries for motorists in the world			1
@entity78 fail : the car collides with the crash barrier and the car slides along its centre jammed : the driver of the car is well and truly stuck and starts an attempt to get out of the door as the vehicle with the camera drives on figures released by the country 's road police in august showed that there were an astonishing 107,000 road accidents on @entity8 's roads in the first seven months of 2012			1
tragically , almost 14,000 were killed in those crashes with a further 137,700 injured			0
the vast majority , some 12,150 , of those deaths were attributed by police to drivers violating the rules of the road			0
around 24,000 crashes were blamed on the poor condition of some of @entity8 's roads			2
in 2011 , 28,000 people died on @entity8 roads in around 200,000 accidents .			0

the driver is unable to move the wedged vehicle in *bizarre* @entity18 clip
