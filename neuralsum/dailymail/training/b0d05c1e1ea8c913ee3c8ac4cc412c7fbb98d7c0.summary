by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:04 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 04:19 est , 1 february 2013 the police complaints commission today admitted that only 21 out of 8,000 corruption allegations against officers had been investigated , as a damning assessment of the watchdog 's shortcomings was published			1
chairwoman dame @entity10 said she did not have the resources to do more , after a report by @entity13 attacked the organisation as ‘ woefully under - equipped and hamstrung '			1
more than 200 officers a year are escaping disciplinary charges by retiring or resigning , the report warned			1
staggeringly , last year nearly one in every four officers was subject of a complaint , amounting to a total of 31,771 in @entity21 and @entity22			1
lacking resources : chairwoman dame @entity10 admitted that the @entity24 is under - resourced , as mp @entity25 said it is ' woefully under - equipped ' to do its job but in a scathing report , the @entity27 warns of a public suspicion that ‘ police are getting away with misconduct and criminality ’ because the @entity24 can not get to the truth			1
' we need more resources and we need more powers , ' @entity34 said today			0
' we can not do the job the public expect us to be able to do			0
' but solicitor @entity40 argued that the @entity24 was failing to make ' effective use of the powers and the resources that they already have ' , on @entity45 this morning			2
he said that what was needed a ' change in culture '			0
of 8547 corruption allegations , 837 were referred to the @entity24 , 21 investigated , 18 prosecuted and just 13 found guilty			1
serious cases of police corruption are ‘ under - investigated ’ the report says , as the @entity24 concentrates on less serious accusations			1
committee chairman @entity25 said the @entity24 was insulting victims by just ‘ scratching the surface ’ of serious alleged abuses			2
evidence : the committee made their conclusions after hearing from witnesses such as @entity62 , left , who said she had ' no confidence ' in the @entity24 and examining the case of pc @entity65 , who ' retired ' before he was disciplined for attacking newspaper vendor @entity67 he warned of a ‘ complaints roundabout ’ where cases are first investigated internally by the accused force , but are then appealed to the @entity24 because the complainant is unhappy			1
the report revealed that one in three such cases is overturned by the @entity24 because of failures in the initial investigation			1
as a result , the @entity24 was ‘ overloaded ’ with appeal cases , mps said			2
committee chairman @entity25 said : ‘ when public trust in the police is tested by complaints of negligence , misconduct and corruption , a strong watchdog is vital to get to the truth - but the @entity24 leaves the public frustrated and faithless			1
’ he added : ‘ nearly a quarter of officers were subject to a complaint last year			1
many were trivial , but some were extremely serious , involving deaths in custody or corruption - it is an insult to all concerned to do no more than scratch the surface of these alleged abuses			2
‘ the @entity24 investigated just a handful and often arrived at the scene late , when the trail had gone cold			1
@entity103 is on the brink of letting grave misconduct go uninvestigated			0
’ the @entity24 is currently investigating the @entity108 disaster in what investigators say is the biggest ever inquiry into police misconduct , during which it will be given new powers and additional funding			2
mps took evidence from victims of police misconduct , their lawyers , police representatives and ministers			0
@entity62 , the mother of @entity122 , told the committee she had ‘ no confidence in [ the commission ] whatsoever ’			0
the committee recommended that @entity24 investigators should take ‘ immediate control ’ of an investigation of serious injury or death involving police officers			2
serious corruption cases - including evidence tampering - should automatically land with the @entity24 instead of a force ’s internal complaints department			1
they also concluded that the @entity24 needed a legal power to require a force to implement its recommendations after something goes wrong			0
during the investigation of the death of newspaper vendor @entity67 , it emerged that the police officer who attacked him , pc @entity65 , had ducked ten complaints by switching forces , including a road - rage attack , racial abuse and a series of heavy - handed arrests			0
he ‘ retired ’ from the @entity13 on medical grounds on the eve of a disciplinary hearing , only to rejoin within days on its civilian staff			0
after transferring to a separate force , @entity159 , he then returned to the @entity13 in 2005 as a police officer			0
@entity24 chairman dame @entity10 backed the call for more resources and powers			0
she said : ‘ this report recognises that we do not yet have the resources or powers to do all that the public rightly expects and needs from us			0
that is what we have been saying for a long time			0
‘ without that , we will continue to struggle to meet the legitimate expectations of complainants and of families who have lost someone in tragic circumstances			0
