@entity0 believes @entity1 have to approach their game at @entity4 as a match they can win - or they risk falling into the relegation battle			1
the @entity1 currently sit 15th in the @entity10 table but are just one point clear of the bottom three ahead of their trip to @entity14 on saturday			1
@entity16 's side had taken four points from clashes with @entity19 and @entity20 before a home defeat to fellow strugglers @entity22 on tuesday evening and could find themselves in the relegation zone if @entity4 can see them off			1
@entity0 ( left ) believes @entity16 's side can not approach games with a negative attitude @entity1 lost to @entity22 on tuesday night and fell to 15th in the @entity10 table but @entity0 feels a safety - first approach could have a detrimental effect on @entity1 , especially if they make the short trip to north @entity33 intent on sitting back and looking to leave with a point			1
' it 's a week where we need to prepare well and make sure the recovery is spot - on			2
it 'll be a tough challenge for us but we 're looking forward to it , ' the @entity41 goalkeeper told the club 's official website			1
' we 've been creating a lot , especially against @entity22 , and we hope to do that against @entity4 too			2
any point away from home is always a good point but if you go into games with that mentality then you tend to lose			0
you have to go out there thinking you can win , try to win and then see what happens			0
' we try not to think too much about what has happened before , we try to prepare for every game in the same manner			0
we know it 's going to be a tough challenge but we have the confidence to go there and try and win the game because of the performances we 've had lately			2
' @entity1 finished 11th last season under the stewardship of former manager @entity66 and were 12 points clear of @entity68 in the final relegation position			1
@entity0 is beaten by a @entity71 shot to give @entity73 's side the three points at @entity75 palace face @entity76 's @entity4 on saturday , who lost 3 - 0 against @entity79 on wednesday but @entity0 thinks the table could be much closer this campaign , with eight points currently separating the bottom half			1
' it 'll probably go down to the last few games of the season , ' he said			0
' we 're going to have to perform as well as we 've been doing but the margins are so small so we need to pick up some points			0
' you always look for other results after a game to see how other teams are doing but i do n't think you have to think too much about it because it 's going to be a tough season			2
' we showed last year the difference between the bottom of the table and halfway up is so close , and you can quickly climb if you get a win as there 's little difference between the teams			0
' after the @entity22 game i could n't understand how we did n't get a point out of the game			0
we had so many chances but for some reason the ball did n't seem to want to go in so we ended up losing , but i was pleased with the performance because we played really well			0
