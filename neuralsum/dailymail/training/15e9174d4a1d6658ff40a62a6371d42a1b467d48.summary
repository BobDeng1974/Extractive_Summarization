president @entity1 is currently on vacation on the island of @entity13			2
tonight he and @entity2 will attend the same get - together , which could be awkward			0
just a few days ago @entity11 slammed @entity10 's approach to @entity38 in an interview @entity2 signs copies of her book hard choices in @entity43 , @entity44 last wednesday			1
@entity11 will be in @entity13 this week for another book signing ' great nations need organizing principles , and " do n't do stupid stuff ' is not an organizing principle , " ' @entity11 said in an interview with the @entity47 , referring to a version of the phrase @entity10 and his advisers have used privately to describe his approach to foreign policy			1
asked for her organizing principle , she replied : ' peace , progress and prosperity			0
this worked for a very long time			0
' @entity11 wrapped her critiques in expressions of respect for the president and sympathy for the tough global decisions he grapples with from the @entity70			0
on monday , a vacation day for @entity10 , he dealt with issues involving @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity38 , as well as terrorism and @entity77 in @entity78			2
' he 's thoughtful , he 's incredibly smart , and able to analyze a lot of different factors that are all moving at the same time , ' she said			0
