by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity2 has been accused of ' unbelievable hypocrisy ' over a spare room subsidy u-turn @entity2 was accused of ‘ unbelievable hypocrisy ’ last night after withdrawing support for one of the government ’s flagship welfare policies			1
the @entity10 demanded significant changes to the spare room subsidy , under which tenants with more bedrooms than they need see their housing benefit reduced			1
the change of heart is being seen as a @entity10 tactic to woo @entity16 in the run - up to the 2015 election – and a desperate attempt to overturn months of appalling poll ratings			1
but @entity21 condemned the move , pointing out that the @entity23 were only able to introduce the subsidy , dubbed the ‘ bedroom tax ’ by critics , thanks to @entity10 votes in the @entity29			1
tories said they were baffled by the change of heart , saying the @entity10 had never argued against the measure in private			2
and it emerged last night that the @entity10 had been given the chance in march to soften the impact of the ‘ bedroom tax ’			2
@entity39 ’s @entity38 programme reported that options were drawn up by civil servants and presented to both coalition parties that would have allowed councils to cushion the impact of benefit cuts under the policy to help people struggling			0
but the @entity10 apparently ignored the suggestion			2
under the controversial reform , introduced in april 2013 , social housing tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced , to tackle what the government calls a ‘ spare room subsidy ’			1
but a government review published this week showed that almost 60 per cent of households affected by the benefit changes were in arrears as a result			0
and a shortage of smaller homes meant just 4.5 per cent of tenants had been able to downsize to avoid it			0
unveiling the u-turn yesterday , @entity10 cabinet minister @entity65 did not call for the bedroom tax to be scrapped – but said it should be reformed so that no one faces a benefit cut if there is no suitable smaller property available			2
in addition , he said all disabled claimants should be exempt			0
mr @entity65 said the issue would be raised with the @entity23 ahead of @entity90 ’s @entity89 but if the @entity10 are not able to secure agreement within government it will be ‘ one of the key things in our election manifesto ’			1
rejecting the accusation of hypocrisy , he said : ‘ we are part of the government and the principle is the right one , which is that people should be paid housing benefit according to the number of rooms that they need			0
then and now : deputy pm @entity2 's change of heart over the spare bedroom subsidy ‘ this is about how that policy is applied in practice			1
it ’s about listening to the evidence and significantly adjusting the policy in the light of that evidence			0
’ @entity21 ’s welfare spokesman @entity118 said : ‘ this is unbelievable hypocrisy from @entity2			1
there would n’t be a bedroom tax if it was n’t for the @entity10			2
’ mr @entity124 ’s official spokesman said the @entity10 shift had not been discussed with the @entity126 or the chancellor			0
but mr @entity2 told @entity128 it was ‘ baloney ’ for the @entity23 to claim they were surprised			0
‘ i ’ve been constantly badgering away within government , with the @entity132 , to try to make sure we really stress - test this properly			0
