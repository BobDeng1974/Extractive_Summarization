by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 12 june 2013 the @entity2 marketing strategy of the 1970s has proved its longevity time and time again			1
every retailer from @entity5 to the @entity6 successfully send representatives round to people 's houses who invite their friends to come over , enjoy a convivial evening - and of course , shop the latest products from the brand 's range ( preferably , the brands no doubt think , with their credit cards well - oiled by a glass or two of chardonnay )			1
and now one entrepreneur from @entity21 is taking the concept to the next level by launching @entity24 , an opportunity to get the girls together , learn about the hottest new nail trends from catwalk to celebrity , and get advice on how to recreate the looks at home			2
@entity33 , 26 , from north @entity21 is the founder and owner of online nail boutique @entity35			2
she started her company only last year and now launches the next stage of her business - the @entity40			1
@entity33 , 26 , right , launched her nail boutique @entity35 last year and is now set to expand with a new service offering manicure parties at customers ' houses a de @entity40 is a bespoke nail soir√©e that caters to guests ' wishes - from tuition on creating a distinct look to providing inspiration for stand - out nails - at home			1
' we 're really excited to be bringing @entity35 to people through @entity56 , ' says @entity33			2
' they 're a really easy way to try out the latest colour and nail art trends and we will show you how to do them yourself ! hosts will earn commission on any purchases their guests make on the night			1
' a de @entity40 is perfect for a girls ' night in , or for the start of a girls ' night out			1
' we use only products at @entity56 that are available on the @entity35 website - brands including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
the relationships we have with our brands are well - established and the brands do not have anything to do with the parties			1
' at this stage @entity56 are only available in @entity21 , but we hope to grow this to other regions , should there be appetite for parties			2
' there are freelance technicians that perform nail treatments at clients ' home , but @entity35 is unique in offering parties of this nature - as an extension of the website			2
' nailing it : some of @entity35 ' custom nail art designs that guests at one of the company 's @entity24 could opt for ' @entity103 from my kitchen table in the evenings and at weekends			0
i have a day job in a boutique finance to keep my company afloat			0
' @entity110 was born out of a long love of nails and the realisation that after three years out of university i was not in a job that fundamentally interested me			0
i was in @entity116 at the time and wanted to do something with my life that i enjoyed and that allowed me to be creative and that was for me			0
' the idea came to me about 18 months ago in december 2011 and the @entity35 website launched in july 2012			0
' i do manis on family and friends			0
i 'm always on hand after dinner parties to do a quick mani or two , and it 's how @entity56 started			0
what i love most about @entity35 and nails is receiving photos sent by friends of their nails who have been inspired by my nail work			0
i have n't done any celebrity nails yet , but who knows in the future			0
' we 've got a feeling the @entity142 will be a hit with girls getting ready for a big night on the town or getting the bridesmaids round the night before a bride 's wedding day			0
hosts will earn commission on any purchases their guests make on the night at a de @entity40			1
