by @entity0 hospital records have been sold to dozens of companies including pharmaceutical giants and private firms without patients ' knowledge or consent , newly - released data shows			1
details about @entity11 patients have gone to major names including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
consultancy firms @entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity20 ) and @entity21 are also among those who have paid to secure data from the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
@entity11 bosses have sold hospital records to dozens of companies including pharmaceutical giants and private firms without patients ' knowledge or consent some have used the apparently anonymous data to formulate marketing strategies , inform their sales teams and work with clients to get new drugs into the @entity11			1
campaigners said patients would be shocked to learn how their records have been sold without their consent to boost the profits of private firms - rather than simply being used to improve @entity11 care			1
the @entity24 said it only charges for the cost of producing the material and does not make a profit			0
the release of the information by @entity24 , the new body in charge of @entity11 patient data , covers contracts agreed with companies from april to december last year			1
it comes after revelations earlier this year that records going back 13 years were sold to the insurance industry , providing guidance to companies about how to set their prices for cover			0
controversial plans to harvest gp records for similar information have been put on hold amid concerns about patient confidentiality , including security from hackers			0
details about @entity11 patients have gone to major names including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 the consultancy firm @entity20 is one of the companies hospital records have been sold to but the furore over the @entity75 project focused attention on the routine use being made of @entity11 hospital records by the commercial sector			1
@entity80 , of campaign group @entity81 , said : ' the core purpose of @entity11 information , usually unstated , is that the information will be used in order for staff to take care of you			2
that 's how 99.99 per cent of patients see it , rather than a way of making money for private companies			2
' this came as a deep shock to many patients because some fear that information about their mental or sexual health or anything else they want to keep secret might fall into the wrong hands			2
' the @entity24 , which pledged to release recent information about hospital data in a bid to improve transparency , says further information going back to 2005 under the supervision of its predecessor will be issued next month			0
it says universities and charities were among those using statistics it supplied , including @entity119 which looked at whether there were changes in the numbers of children admitted to hospital with respiratory infections after the introduction of the smoking ban on july 1 2007			0
the @entity24 insisted patients could not be identified from such data because it was ' pseudonymised ' - stripped of significant letters or numbers that might give clues about individuals			2
however , @entity16 accessed anonymised data that was classed as ' sensitive ' to assist them in ' benchmarking performance against national trends '			1
@entity17 bought data to look at referrals between gps and hospitals so it could analyse patient numbers and episodes of care at both an @entity11 trust and hospital level			1
the private firm @entity147 , which works with the @entity11 and pharmaceutical companies , also accessed data			1
on its website it said it had helped a client during the pre-launch of a drug in irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity155 ) to raise the ' priority of @entity155 on the commissioning agenda '			0
@entity19 used pseudonymised but ' sensitive ' data ' as part of our consulting services for clients '			0
in total , 104 health and social care organisations ( such as @entity11 trusts ) and bodies such as universities and charities were included , alongside 56 private firms			2
@entity171 , of the campaign group @entity173 , said @entity24 was ' deliberately concealing ' releases of data that might cause itself , or ministers or other officials , embarrassment or political damage			0
it knew of such data because it had attempted to get hold of it			0
he said it was a ' ridiculous assertion ' that pseudonymised data was not sensitive or identifiable			0
commercial customers had made clear it was possible to track individuals visit by visit through hospital - and with information in press reports , social media posts or the date your child was born - so their entire record could be read , he said			0
' billions of patient records continue to be sold for commercial use without patients ' knowledge or consent , using as justification the very law that minsters have said provides additional safeguards			0
how long does @entity24 think it can get away with ignoring @entity206 's promise to stamp out the commercial exploitation of @entity11 patients ' information ? ' he added .			1
