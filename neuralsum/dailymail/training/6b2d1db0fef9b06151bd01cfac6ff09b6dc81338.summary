by @entity0 published : 20:59 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 17:02 est , 14 june 2013 cheap supermarket sausages can give shoppers ' more banger for their buck ' compared to big brands costing much more , it is claimed			1
a study by consumer experts at which ? found the @entity11 range pack of pork sausages contains 42per cent meat , which is the same as @entity15 thick pork sausages			1
however , the big brand version costs three times more at £ 2.40 versus just 80p			2
bang out of order : @entity11 's @entity19 for 80p contain the same amount of meat as @entity15 thick sausages , which is three times as expensive at £ 2.40 which ? also found that a shopper prepared to pay £ 2.99 for a pack of @entity11 ’ s premium range pork sausages – 59p more than the @entity15 brand - would get 97per cent meat			1
researchers also found a similar pattern with burgers , which are particularly popular as the country enters the barbecue season			2
meat feast : @entity11 's premium range sausages for £ 2.99 contain 97 per cent meat at only 59p more than the big brand for example , @entity37 beef burgers cost £ 8.30 per kg yet only contain 77per cent meat , while @entity40 ’s quarter pound beef burgers are 90per cent beef and cost £ 6.12 per kg. the recent horsemeat food fraud scandal has turned the spotlight on just what goes in to the nation ’s processed meat products , with many people changing their diets			1
at the same time , some eight in ten shoppers now check the ingredients in the hope of getting some reassurance on the ingredients			0
currently , there are strict rules about what goes into a sausage or burger with minimum limits for meat content to ensure shoppers are not misled			2
for example , anything claiming to be a pork sausage must be a minimum of 42per cent pork meat			0
other products can be called simply a ‘ sausage ’ if it contains at least 32per cent pork , at least 30per beef or lamb , or at least 26per cent chicken			0
despite the recent horsemeat scandal , which ? complained that the @entity77 government is currently trying to push through a weakening of labelling rules , which includes decriminalising food labelling violations			0
as a result , rogues who decided to con the public with suspect food labels and ingredients will face much weaker sanctions , if any			0
not packing much : @entity37 beef burgers contain 77per cent meat compared to @entity40 's beef burgers ' 90 per cent , yet is still £ 2.18 more per kg which ? executive director , @entity90 , said : ‘ we want mislabelling to remain a criminal offence , even more so after the horsemeat scandal , so those responsible for misleading consumers can be held to account			1
’ he added : ‘ branded goods do n’t always provide the best value for money , as we ’ ve found shoppers can get more banger for their buck by choosing supermarket own - brand sausages			1
‘ it ’s important that people know what they ’re getting so they can make an informed choice			0
‘ in the wake of the horsemeat scandal , we want the government to think again over their plans to decriminalise food labelling offences to help restore trust in the food industry			0

supermarket 's own products contain more meat than big brands '
burgers and sausages from @entity40 and @entity11 's value for money
