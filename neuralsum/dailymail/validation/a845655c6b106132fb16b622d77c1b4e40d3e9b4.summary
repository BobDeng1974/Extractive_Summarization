single mothers have lost their @entity2 challenge against the government 's £ 350 - a - week benefit cap			1
@entity6 's highest court narrowly ruled by three judges to two that the benefit cap restricting welfare to the equivalent of a £ 35,000 a year salary was not unlawful			1
two women forced into temporary accommodation after suffering domestic violence said the cap violated their human rights			1
work and pensions secretary @entity17 , pictured in @entity18 this morning , welcomed the @entity2 ruling they claimed the cap disproportionately hit women , especially those trying to escape violent partners			1
but the @entity2 said the cap , introduce by the @entity27 government to clamp down on spiralling welfare bills , was legally okay			2
the benefit cap limits the amount of benefits a household can receive to £ 500 a week for couples and £ 350 a week for households of a single adult			2
work and pensions secretary @entity17 said : ' i am delighted that the country 's highest court has agreed with this government and overwhelming public opinion that the benefit cap is right and fair			1
' he added : ' i am proud to say that it is one of the most significant reforms we 've implemented over the past five years			0
' a key part of the long - term economic plan , the benefit cap is encouraging people to change their behaviour and motivating them to find work			0
' the two lone parents went to the @entity2 , along with a representative child from each family			0
their lawyers argued that the cap unjustifiably discriminated against abuse victims , who are predominantly women , and failed to have regard to the best interests of the child			1
@entity61 - one of the dissenting judges - ruled that the @entity39 had failed to take proper account of ' the best interests of the children ' , as it was obliged to do under the @entity66 they said the cap substantially reduces weekly income and puts the mothers at risk of losing their safe homes			1
the justices hearing the case included @entity2 deputy president @entity61 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
@entity76 , giving the lead judgment , said he accepted that the cap was ' a proportionate means ' of meeting legitimate @entity39 aims , which include deficit reduction and incentivising parents to find work			0
he noted that the cap for households with children was equivalent to a gross annual salary of £ 35,000 , which is higher than the earnings of half of the @entity6 's working households			1
although the short - term savings were a small proportion of the total welfare budget , they nevertheless contributed towards deficit reduction , and were also intended to change behaviour over the longer term			0
but @entity61 - one of the dissenting judges - ruled that the @entity39 had failed to take proper account of ' the best interests of the children ' , as it was obliged to do under the @entity66			0
@entity61 said @entity66 was relevant even though it was not yet generally part of domestic law			0
she ruled that the cap deprived some children of provision for their basic needs , which could not be in their best interests			2
the cap 's aim of incentivising parents to seek work discriminated against lone parents as they were the least able to do so , said @entity61 .			2

@entity6 's top court narrowly ruled that the @entity113 was not unlawful
