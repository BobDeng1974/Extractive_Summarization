it may not look nearly as good as @entity1 in a bikini on @entity3 , but a new type of drone could save your life if you get into trouble in the water			1
@entity11 is a lifeguard drone that can carry an inflatable life ring to a swimmer in under a minute , according to the developers			1
the system uses a specially adapted carrying device that can rush a life ring out over the water and drop it close to a swimmer in distress			1
the device is being built by students at a school in @entity31 , @entity32 the rings are designed to automatically inflate as soon as they hit the water , helping swimmers to stay afloat until rescuers arrive			1
the engineers behind the project , who are based in @entity31 , @entity32 , say the drone would be particularly useful for helping swimmers who stray into rip tide currents			1
drones could prove invaluable in search and rescue operations as well as disaster scenarios where it is dangerous for relief workers to enter buildings			2
but currently quadcopters risk injuring humans with their blades and break easily upon light collisions because of their delicate , exposed parts			0
now engineers have created the ‘ world ’s first collision - proof drone ’ that has a spherical ' rollcage ' , meaning it can bounce around buildings like a ball			2
the @entity62 drone uses obstacles to find its way around buildings , instead of avoiding them , so it could roll along a row of windows before locating an opening			0
scientists from @entity71 ’s @entity70 have won $ 1 million in a drone competition sponsored by the @entity73			0
‘ @entity75 can safely fly indoors and in complex environments , is easy to fly , and can be operated close to humans , ’ they claim on their website			0
lifeguards rescue more than 10,000 swimmers from rip tide currents - strong currents of water that can drag swimmers out to sea			1
however they often carry a great deal of danger for the lifeguards themselves and account for 80 per cent of rescues they perform			2
@entity92 , a teacher at @entity94 school in @entity31 and founder of @entity96 , began developing the @entity11 system with students in 2014			1
he said : ' @entity11 is a life saving drone accessory that can carry an automatically inflating life ring to a swimmer in distress in less than 30 seconds			1
' the system can be attached to any drone capable of carrying a @entity107 camera and brushless gimbal			2
' mr @entity92 and his team already have a working prototype of their system and are now running a crowdfunding campaign in an attempt to build commercial products			0
they say the final model of @entity11 will be able to carry up to four inflatable rings that can be dropped one at a time at the press of a button			1
it would allow life - guards to get help out to swimmers in trouble almost immediately while waiting for rescue boats or other vehicles to arrive			1
while it may not carry the glamour of a beachwear clad lifeguard running across the sand like in the popular tv series , it could mean response times are quicker			0
the system ( shown in action above ) can be attached to any drone capable of carrying a @entity107 camera and brushless gimba the drone is able to fly over a swimmer in distress and drop an inflatable life ring to help keep them afloat @entity1 ( right ) in @entity3 only had a boyancy aid and the odd speed boat to help rescue swimmers @entity148 , one of the students involved in the project , said : ' currently the only solution to this problem is another human being risking their life to venture into the rip tide to save the swimmer in crisis			1
' we plan to use drone technology to add to the arsenal of the lifeguard			0
' a ring can be attached to the drone assembly using vinyl loops which then release when hovering over the swimmer in distress			0
it is the latest in a number of drones being developed to help save people 's lives in emergency situations			0
students at @entity174 in @entity175 have developed an @entity176 to deliver a defibrillator to the scene of a heart attack			0
mr @entity92 and the @entity11 team have already tested their system in swimming pools , on the beach , lakes and even in a frozen river			2
they insist , however , they are not looking to replace lifeguards			0
they said : ' we 're not proposing that this product could ever replace a trained lifeguard or take the place of other safety equipment			0
' we 're just hoping that our simple device can augment the water safety tools that are in use today			2
' they said as drones become more popular , the @entity11 system could also be installed along beaches so that drone users can quickly attach them to their machines in the event of an emergency .			1

@entity11 *converts* existing drones into a flying life - guard to help swimmers
the system can carry and drop four inflatable rings to swimmers in trouble
the device is being built by students at a school in @entity31 , @entity32
life rings inflate automatically on *contact* with water after being dropped
the developers say it could particularly help swimmers caught in rip tides
