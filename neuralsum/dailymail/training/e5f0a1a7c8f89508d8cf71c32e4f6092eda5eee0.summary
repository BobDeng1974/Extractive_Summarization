@entity2 's ' @entity1 ' advert was the 1994 billboard that - quite literally - stopped traffic			1
it also aroused the ire of feminists , many of whom described it as degrading			2
now the model who starred in the ad has opened up about the criticism she received at the time and said , far from being degrading , it was actually empowering			1

' it did n’t degrade them like some said or say			1
empowered : supermodel @entity25 , the star of @entity2 's @entity1 campaign , maintains that it helped empower women and improve advertising for good , despite the backlash of criticism it received speaking to the @entity33 , she continued : ' it was controversial at the time , sure - but it made waves and you can see its influence still today			1
' it was one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history and i am so proud to be a part of it			0
' the advert , which was shot by @entity46 and saw @entity21 posing in a black @entity2 and pants , certainly proved controversial			1
much of the controversy centred on traffic accidents , with some commuters blaming the huge roadside poster for their lack of concentration			2
others claimed the racy ad was derogatory towards women , even as they flocked to buy the bra in their millions			2
despite the controversy , the makers of the ad were honoured in 2011 , when the billboard was declared the most eye - catching ad of the previous 20 years			2
still going strong : the ad sparked a sensation when it was unveiled and was blamed for stopping traffic and causing accidents			1

’ she reflected on her career 's turning point , which saw her feature in a @entity89 and @entity90 editorial for @entity91			1
' for me , that shoot was a slap in the face to those who put me in the pin - up box , ' she said			2
' that was my jump from commercial to editorial			0
i could hear people gasp as they realised it was me			0
’ despite her success , the fashion world almost lost her to @entity105			0
' after doing a few films , i went to @entity107 looking for an agent – and it was just pathetic			0
' i met people who said , " yes , we can talk about the movie over dinner			0
" i was like , " what dinner ? i can just read the script here			0
" having been exposed to the sleazier side of @entity105 , @entity25 gave up her acting dream and returned to modelling full time - and became a mother			1
' i never saw myself as a mum , ' she admits			0
' there are girls who grow up thinking of marriage and babies , but i never wanted that			0
but now it is everything to me			0
