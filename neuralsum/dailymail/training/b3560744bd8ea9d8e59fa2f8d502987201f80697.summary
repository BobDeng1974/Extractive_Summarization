in a parallel universe , there is a version of me who is toned , tanned and good at juicing			1
a me who wears rollerblades ( and does n’t fall over ) ; a me who watches her carbs ; a me who springs out of bed , rather than emerging from it like a @entity13 roused from under the duvet			2
in that parallel universe , it is a fair bet that i live at @entity18 ’s @entity17			1
strike a pose , there 's nothing to it : the resort offers guests a place where they can work on their wellbeing let me let you in on a secret : if you want to get fit then you need to go where the fit people are			1
it is a whole lot easier to go with the tide			2
and that is precisely the reason i am at @entity17 – a high temple of @entity39 vitality that is windswept and glossy			1
and has really good teeth			2
bored of the usual ‘ try jogging			2
fail ’ palaver , i have decided on a one - two punch of a fitness boost and a dose of vitamin @entity45 i am not sure that i know what i have let myself in for as i pack my tracksuit bottoms and greying trainers , and head off across the @entity50			1
putting some effort into it : even if the work - out is tough , the view offers a sight to soothe the soul health is serious stuff , stateside			1
in @entity18 , the question is not so much ‘ when should you go to the gym ? ’ as ‘ why are n’t you there already ? ’			1
i am , however , in luck			2
my first requirement of any ‘ break ’ that involves running around a lot is a splendid setting in which to do it			2
ideally involving a stretch of sand sweeping away outside my window , its edges tickled by surf rolling under big blue skies			2
so far , so good			2
i breathe deeply on the balcony of my immense and rather fabulous corner suite			2
@entity78 is the quieter , less iconic neighbour to bustling @entity81 @entity80 – which sits a 10 - minute taxi ride away through this palm - fringed city			1
but its @entity87 - @entity39 cool and margarita nightlife can wait			1
i am here to be perky , not plastered			2
as @entity18 ’s prodigal daughter @entity90 once said , the rhythm is gon na get ya			1
and by that , i ’m sure she was referring to the fact you ca n’t spend a day in the city without ending up doing some kind of cardio workout			1
settling in nicely : left - the view from the hotel terrace ; right - @entity101 takes a quick break with a walk on the sand my husband – a man who is never normally seen trying to combine a knee lift and a disco beat – proves this neatly			1
we have only just checked in when he decides to try ‘ cardio kickboxing ’			1
with eight nut - brown septuagenarians and a model			1
he lasts 45 minutes , blaming his lack of endurance on jet - lag			1
i opt for a ‘ @entity117 ’ amid a room full of steel - thighed women for whom the instructor 's exhortation to ‘ activate the pain ’ is greeted with beatific smiles			1
you do not have to be a lithe lycra babe to come here , though			2
the vibe is inclusive – as are the facilities			2
a vast range of daily classes is included in your room price – from ‘ gentle ’ options like @entity132 and @entity133 to things with scary names like ‘ @entity136 ’ and ‘ @entity137 ’			1
there is also a full programme of free health workshops to choose from			2
plus a gym , a spa and two pools			0
personal training , spa treatments and all manner of mind / body / spirit consultations can also be paid for separately , or included in a package			0
a lot to enjoy : the resort sits in a pristine position on the edge of the @entity50 on @entity78 it is all so positive			0
as is the @entity39 way , health is made convenient			0
the cola is organic , the coffee @entity157 , and the hotel bar ’s mojitos are made with antioxidant acai berries			0
you even have to ask for the salt ( should you want it )			0
but no - one feels deprived - for every banana smoothie breakfast , there is a healthy fry up or pancakes			1
whole wheat , of course			0
needing a change of pace , i book one of the health packages			0
my ‘ @entity178 ’ course kicks off with an @entity180 massage			0
and the healing energy session that follows is quite the experience			0
tornado - like @entity183 had me singing and breathing while she runs around the room ringing @entity186 bowls			1
‘ i am going to put it on your phone ! ’ she enthuses at the end of the session , grabbing my @entity192 and singing an affirmation into it			0
i am not entirely sure what had gone on – it is a bit like being put in a blender with a guru and an aerobics instructor			0
keeping up with the style of things : the hotel lobby flirts with @entity18 's classic @entity81 vibe but i do feel energised			1
some things are best not deconstructed			0
i also try an hour ’s meditation with @entity207 , who teaches me to drown out the gym music and empty my mind			0
if you can go to your happy place with @entity212 in the background , finding it sitting up a mountain is going to be a cinch			0
my final session is with nutritionist @entity218			0
i am not looking forward to being told not to eat carbs			0
fortunately , although she keeps trying to persuade me to do things with flax , @entity218 proves open and really helpful			0
‘ eat carbs , eat wheat – but as a weekly treat , ’ she encourages , while giving tips on spaghetti squash and vegan truffles			0
she does not even blanch when i tell her i am doing the 5:2 diet – and gives me ways to maximise it			0
and relax : guests can enjoy ocean views and soft beds once they have completed their day 's exercise this is the key to @entity17 – you are allowed to pursue what works for you			1
@entity218 and i finish with a chat about lifestyle			0
‘ you ’re 40 ? ’ she exclaims			0
‘ i thought you were in your late 20s ! ’ this is what a week at @entity17 will do for you			1
better than a facelift any day			0
a four - night stay at @entity242 ( www.canyonranch.com ) , including return flights from @entity244 and a mini ' @entity178 ' retreat , costs from £ 1385 per person			1
@entity250 is based travel after 26 may 2014 ( two people travelling together )			0
the two - night ‘ mini energiser retreat ’ includes a guided meditation , acupuncture or ' healing energy ' session - plus a consultation with a nutritionist and an @entity180 massage			1
book through @entity260 ( 020 8968 0501 ; www.thehealthyholidaycompany.com ) .			0
