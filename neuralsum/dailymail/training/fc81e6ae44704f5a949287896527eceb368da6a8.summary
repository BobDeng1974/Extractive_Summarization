' attack : @entity6 ( left ) blinded his wife @entity24 ( right ) with a cigarette but she says she has forgiven him and that he should not have been jailed for 11 years mrs @entity10 , who founded two @entity13 charities for the disabled , was already blind in her left eye following an accident in 2009			1
she was immediately totally blinded as her right eyeball burst in the attack by her husband , which surgeons have so far been unable to repair			1
prosecutor @entity35 said mr @entity6 had gone with his wife to hospital where she had initially accepted she was responsible for the eye injury			1
only when a matron challenge the pair , did mr @entity6 begin nodding and crying			1
mr @entity35 said : ' he said " yes i did it ! "			2
he was close to tears when he said : " i could not cope			2
" he said he had pushed the cigarette into his wife 's eye			1
' he told an @entity47 worker he found the pressure of living with mrs @entity10 too much			1
' he was bottling it up			2
he said it was like a volcano going off			2
' his wife is 3ft 2in tall and has been left in a wheelchair because of problems with her hips and legs			1
abuse : @entity6 pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and the judge said he was guilty of serious violence aimed at his wife mr @entity6 pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent			1
his barrister @entity64 said : ' there is very little to say			2
his wife is a very fragile lady			1
she is of the sweetest nature			0
she holds no resentment at all			0
despite all this she has no bitterness			0
she wants to resume the relationship			0
but that is not going to work			0
this is a tragic case in many ways			0
he understands what he did and the injuries to her eye are appalling			0
' sentencing him at @entity13 judge @entity79 said : ' this is a desperately serious offence			0
your wife is terribly disabled			1
' she is as vulnerable as a victim could be			0
you were her carer in a position of trust			0
you breached that trust on this occasion and others as well she was frightened of you			0
you talked about using her as a punch bag and being capable of killing her			0
' she says nevertheless she loves you and has forgiven you			0
that speaks to her credit , not yours			0
it also speaks to her condition that she would rather be with you , than on her own			0
it shows you have conditioned her in to accepting violence			0
she has been left totally blind , that is on top of everything else she has to bear			1
i have agonized whether there is room to reflect the merciful feeling your wife holds although i think they are misguided '			2
