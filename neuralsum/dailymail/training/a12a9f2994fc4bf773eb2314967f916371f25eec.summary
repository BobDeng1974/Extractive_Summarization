by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 09:16 est , 9 may 2012 a hugely expensive and controversial wind farm was given the government ’s go - ahead yesterday , building a permanent ‘ blight on the countryside ’ , campaigners said			1
the £ 365million project , the biggest ever in @entity7 and @entity8 , will involve erecting 76 turbines - each of which will stand 475ft tall			1
@entity13 lovers , who have been fighting the proposal for almost two decades , said the farm would be ‘ ugly ’ and ruin the local landscape of hills and valleys			2
the beautiful @entity20 countryside which campaigners fear could be ruined by plans to build a wind farm but despite their petitions and appeals , they lost their struggle when permission was granted to build what will be among the highest turbines in @entity31 across 155 acres of countryside			1
each taller than the @entity34 ( 443ft ) , it is claimed they will be able to produce enough energy to supply 206,000 homes			1
but to those opposed to the @entity41 - y - @entity40 development in @entity20 , say that electricity will come at far too high a price for the area			0
a spokesperson for the @entity46 , named after an affected village , said : ‘ wind farms are ugly , inefficient and will spoil the wild beautiful areas around the village			2
‘ our fight against the wind farm developers is one of @entity55 against @entity56 , big business against small vulnerable communities			1
‘ measures should be introduced to prevent the free for all by developers , that is taking place in areas such as @entity46			0
’ energy minister @entity64 ( pictured ) who supports the proposed scheme he continued : ‘ this ugly , industrial wind farm development is totally unfair and it would ruin our landscape and our hopes to develop tourism			1
‘ this proposal will be detrimental to our future , short - term gain will lead to long term losses of our beautiful landscape			0
’ the development on rural land between the @entity78 towns of @entity79 and @entity80 , was given the backing of the energy ministry			0
the wind farm is being built by @entity85 company @entity84 is likely to cost around £ 300 million , with construction starting as early as next year			1
despite vocal objections local councils chose not to block to the scheme			0
former welsh assembly member dr @entity90 , who has seen the detailed plans , said the move forward was a ‘ disappointment ’			0
he added : ‘ it is too big and far too intrusive to our local communities			0
’ the site of the farm is owned by the @entity8 , which has worked with the company on the proposal , and is backed by the @entity78 wing of the @entity102 , whose director commented : ‘ @entity102 welcomes the positive approach @entity84 has taken to nature conservation through the @entity108 wind farm - an approach which will result in a net gain for wildlife in this area			1
’ wind turbines are being switched off in @entity114 because of fears for children 's safety			1
up to 16 turbines at school sites in the @entity120 are affected by the move , in what is being described as a ' precautionary measure ' by council bosses			2
the machines are being turned off following concerns raised by @entity128 councillors and residents earlier this year			0
the building of two new turbines in @entity114 have also been postponed			2
@entity134 ’s @entity133 member @entity132 , voiced concerns about their safety and refused to back their construction due to a lack of exclusion zone in either scheme			0
despite the turbine shutdown , however , @entity143 , @entity128 council ’s deputy chief executive has vowed to continue to press on with renewable energy schemes			0
she added : ‘ we hope that other companies will adopt a similar attitude and that that this project will set the gold standard for wind farm developments in @entity8 and , indeed , elsewhere			1
’ @entity84 has pledged a benefits package to the community said to be worth £ 55 million , including £ 3 million for habitat management and £ 6,000 a year for each megawatt of electricity paid into a community fund			0
energy minister @entity64 said : ‘ onshore wind plays an important role in enhancing our energy security			2
‘ it is the cheapest form of renewable electricity and reduces our reliance on foreign fuel			0
‘ this project in @entity20 will generate vast amounts of home - grown renewable electricity and provide a significant benefits package for the local community			2
’ the green light for the project comes after the government released a joint report with industry body @entity175 highlighting the benefits to the economy of onshore wind , including for local communities			1
@entity84 said it would cost around £ 300 million to build the wind farm , creating or supporting around 300 jobs in @entity8 , and once a final investment decision has been taken construction could start next year with the first electricity generated in 2016			1
@entity186 , @entity84 ’s head of onshore wind development in the @entity188 , said : ‘ @entity108 is a major project that could be worth more than £ 1 billion to the @entity188 economy			1
‘ we have consistently stated our commitment to making sure that we maximise the value of @entity108 to the region and to @entity8			0
this is now our priority			0
’ campaigners are angry about the proposed wind farm project , which could look similar to these turbines erected in @entity198 ( pictured ) last month plans to build the world ’s largest wind farm at one of @entity188 ’s top tourist attractions are facing new opposition after protestors mocked up a video showing how the giant turbines will ‘ blight ’ the heavily - protected @entity206			1
the £ 3 billion farm will be visible to the millions of tourists who visit the @entity212 and @entity214 coast every year - and tourism chiefs fear it will drive visitors away from the area , currently @entity7 ’s only natural world heritage site			1
it also emerged that the @entity221 could soon be cashing in on dozens of wind turbines - even though they have been condemned by @entity223 and prince @entity223			2
energy firms have been given the green light for 45 windmills on @entity228 land , which will rake in £ 1million a year in subsidies			0
homeowners living next door to the prospective wind farms in @entity8 and @entity198 accused the @entity221 of hypocrisy , after the @entity223 described them as a ‘ horrendous blot on the landscape ’ while his father called them ‘ useless ’ and ‘ a disgrace ’ .			0

campaigners fear project will cause *irreversible* damage to countryside
each of the 76 turbines will be taller than the @entity34 and will be among the highest in @entity31
wind farm will be *spread* across up to 155 acres of countryside
