by @entity0 for @entity1 for years humans have wondered what the high pitched noises made by dolphins and whales mean			0
and now scientists believe that the marine animals squeal with delight to express their happiness			1
initially , noises emitted by the animals when offered fish treats were thought to be signals communicating the presence of food			1
scientists believe that dolphins ( stock image ) and beluga whales squeal with delight to express their @entity21 , noises emitted by the animals when offered fish treats were thought to be signals communicating the presence of food whales and dolphins are known to squeal when they hear a whistle or buzzer associated with a food reward			1
but when dolphins and beluga whales were trained to switch off a sound after making a deep dive , they announced a successful mission by producing the same squeals			2
it was the equivalent of a human ' whoop ' of triumph , according to @entity40 cetacean expert and author dr @entity41			1
' the [ squealing ] behaviour had transferred over to another stimulus that was n't food , ' he said			2
to investigate further , dr @entity41 and his colleagues at the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , analysed decades of recordings of experiments involving dolphins and beluga whales			1
beluga whales ( pictured ) also squealed to signify happiness in the experiment			1
dr @entity41 said : ' we think we have demonstrated that it [ the victory squeal ] has emotional content			2
' they wanted to understand if the delay before a squeal was mirrored by the release of dopamine , a brain chemical that stimulates sensations of pleasure			1
dopamine release takes 100 milliseconds , so if the delay between a reward promise and a squeal was longer than this amount of time it would suggest a connection			1
in dolphins , the delay was 151 milliseconds and in beluga whales 250 milliseconds			0
' we think we have demonstrated that it [ the victory squeal ] has emotional content , ' said dr @entity41 , whose findings appear in the @entity83			2
male dolphins have been known to show their romantic side by presenting their partner with a specially - selected piece of seaweed , which if she accepts , can lead to a relationship and mating documentary crews have previously filmed a male bottlenose dolphin wooing his sweetheart with a strand of seaweed , indicating the animals communicate in many different ways			0
courting males will spend hours looking for the longest and most perfect strand of seaweed to present to the objects of their desire			0
before handing it over , a hot - blooded dolphin will use the seaweed to show off his prowess : tossing it between his fins , tail and nose			0
if the female is impressed , she will accept the seaweed and then play with it seductively like a feather boa , they said			0
now they are an item , the amorous pair will do the dolphin equivalent of cuddling - stroking each other with their fins - as they twist and spin around each other			0
by using remote - controlled cameras shaped like small animals , the documentary makers discovered that dolphins can be pushy parents , loyal friends , and prone to adolescent bursts of machismo .			0

scientists at the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , first thought the noise indicated the presence of food
but one expert said that an experiment showed the squeals are the equivalent of a human ' whoop ' of triumph , signifying happiness
by studying the release of dopamine a brain chemical that stimulates sensations of pleasure they have proved the noise is emotional
