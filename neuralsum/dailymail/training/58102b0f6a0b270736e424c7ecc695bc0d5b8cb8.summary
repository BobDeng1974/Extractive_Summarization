by @entity0 middle class shoppers are increasingly turning away from traditional supermarkets and embracing discount retailers such as @entity4 , @entity5 and even £ 1 shops in their efforts to bag a bargain			1
so it ’s little wonder that @entity11 , which has seen its market share fall to a ten - year low , is rolling out ‘ pound zones ’ in 300 stores to try to win back their custom			1
but how do @entity11 ’s £ 1 buys compare to @entity18 ’s ? @entity19 finds out ... @entity0 attempts to find whether @entity11 's £ 1 offerings are better than @entity18 's @entity21 @entity11 : @entity23 ’s baby , 75 cotton balls you may not get that many cotton wool balls for your pound at @entity11 ; however , the supermarket ’s offering is a big - name brand , and the quality shows			1
5/5 @entity18 : @entity35 , 125 soft cotton wool balls these feel a touch more synthetic and scratchy on my skin than @entity11 ’s offering			1
they are about half the size , too , meaning you end up using twice as many			0
@entity44 @entity11 : @entity45 3 for women ( two - pack ) with a comfortable curved handle and handy slip - on cover , these glide well over the skin , leave my legs nice and smooth and should last several uses			1
4/5 @entity18 : @entity54 ( four - pack ) it ’s a close call — or should that be shave ? these work just as well as @entity11 ’s , but although there are twice as many , they ’re slightly harsher on my skin			1
3/5 @entity61 @entity11 : @entity63 tablets ( pack of 16 ) you ’ll find this well - known brand in @entity11 ’s pound zone — and at a price that wo n’t give you a headache			1
4/5 @entity18 : galpharm @entity61 capsules ( pack of 16 ) these contain exactly the same amount ( 500mg ) of paracetamol as @entity11 ’s , and the only difference is the packaging			1
4/5 @entity11 has announced a new £ 1 range to put it in direct competition with @entity18 @entity78 @entity11 : softy tissues ( ten - pack ) these decent tissues are as good as my usual buy , @entity83 , in terms of volume , size and thickness			1
left my nose nice and soft , and at this price , not to be sniffed at			0
5/5 @entity18 : @entity90 ( ten travel packs ) a big name brand and great quality — ideal for stashing in your handbag or pocket			2
there ’s no need for me to pay £ 1.50 for a pack of six like i usually do			0
5/5 pregnancy tests @entity11 : 1st aid pregnancy test ( two - pack ) with the average @entity105 chemist charging over £ 8 for a test , this is an incredible bargain and worked perfectly well for a pregnant friend who tested them for me			1
5/5 @entity18 : @entity111 pregnancy test ( two - pack ) slightly less basic than the @entity11 version , and when tested by the same pregnant friend , this kit worked perfectly well , and quickly			1
why spend more ? 4/5 @entity115 @entity11 : @entity117 washing - up liquid ( 1 litre ) not particularly thick or overly - bubbly , the large bottle looks great , but you ’ll probably end up using more than if you ’d forked out for a more expensive brand			1
2/5 @entity18 : @entity121 ( 2 for £ 1 ) this is a great deal — you end up with 350ml more liquid than at @entity11 , and it is a recognisable brand - name			1
cut through the grease on my dishes a treat			0
3/5 but as our survey shows , for £ 1 bargains @entity18 is still the best @entity132 @entity11 : @entity134 ( 13 washes / 455ml ) yet another big - name brand from @entity11 , this is good quality stuff that gives great results			1
however , it ’s a really teeny bottle			0
3/5 @entity18 : @entity140 ( 30 washes / 1l ) we could have bought the same brand as we did in @entity11 , as well as this larger bottle from @entity121 , which smelt similar and left my clothes feeling almost as soft			1
i usually use @entity134 but would be tempted to switch			0
4/5 @entity147 @entity11 : @entity148 this has good quality bristles and the sheer silliness of the design — it looks like a lady in a glamorous dress , whose short , spiky hair forms the bristles — should make you smile when you ’re elbow - deep in suds			1
3/5 @entity18 : @entity160 2 washing - up brushes the bargain retailer also sold @entity148 brushes , but these were a bit more effective , if not as exciting			1
the bristles are a slightly different shape , letting me get into the nooks and crannies of my dirty dishes more easily			0
4/5 storage containers @entity11 : @entity172 collapsible food storage container top marks for the innovative collapsible design , which folds up almost flat when not in use			2
unlike the @entity18 containers , it also clearly states that it ’s safe to put in the microwave and freezer			2
4/5 @entity18 : @entity183 food containers ( five - pack ) with a wide selection of tubs and containers , @entity18 beat @entity11 hands - down , yet the quality is a little basic , with slightly thinner plastic			1
at these prices though , who ’s to quibble ? 3/5 @entity193 @entity11 : @entity172 comfort - grip peeler a traditional shape with a chunky , easy - grip handle , this is nice and sharp , and made light work of my potatoes			1
i ca n’t believe i paid £ 10 for my @entity202 peeler when this is exactly the same ! 4/5 @entity18 : @entity183 vegetable peeler available in several bright colours , with an almost identical handle , this comes with a protective blade cover for when it ’s not in use			2
a nice touch , especially considering i have a toddler who likes nothing better than trying to get hold of sharp objects			0
4/5 batteries @entity11 : @entity216 aaa batteries ( ten - pack ) going head - to - head with the same product , you get two fewer batteries at @entity11 and only size @entity216 was available			1
3/5 @entity18 : @entity216 aaa batteries ( 12 - pack ) as well as a bigger packet , the discount store also sold other sizes , too , including popular aas			2
more power to them , then			0
4/5 bin bags @entity11 : @entity230 20 refuse sacks a bit thin and liable to tear , but are more than 15cm longer than @entity18 ’s			1
the clever ‘ tuklok ’ has a hole punched in the top at the side , through which you tuck the rest of the bag to keep it shut , minimising spillage			0
3/5 @entity18 : @entity242 refuse sacks you get what you pay for with cheap bin bags , and they are usually , well , a little bit rubbish			2
these are fairly thin , so you may need to double up			0
2/5 @entity251 @entity11 : jumbo - size scented dehumidifier suitable for all areas of the home this contains beads which draw in excess moisture from the air to stop damp , mould , mildew and condensation			2
this claims to last up to six weeks and has a lovely fresh fragrance			0
5/5 @entity18 : @entity265 jasmine scented hanging dehumidifier this works in the same way as @entity11 ’s dehumidifier , but is designed specifically for wardrobes — removing moisture from clothes to prevent mould — and only lasts up to three weeks			1
4/5 @entity274 @entity11 : @entity275 80s the packaging looked cheap , so i quickly decanted these into a tea caddy before my book club came around			0
luckily the ladies could n’t taste the difference			0
3/5 @entity282 100s an impressive range of tea from several well - known brands , and with bigger pack sizes , too			0
i usually pay £ 2.20 for @entity287 , so i will definitely be buying my tea from @entity18 in future			0
4/5 chocolate @entity11 : @entity292 milk chocolate 200g a little too sweet , and not a patch on @entity294 ’s , but at half the price this was more than adequate to satisfy my son ’s sweet tooth , with plenty to spare			0
2/5 @entity18 : @entity301 milk chocolate 300g my chocoholic husband declared this bar the chunkiest he ’d ever tried			0
bigger than @entity11 ’s , with more stylish packaging			0
3/5 mint @entity307 @entity11 : @entity309 dinner mints 200g ( 20 mints ) these are passable , but are made with thinner chocolate than the @entity314 you can buy in @entity18 and have a stronger , more synthetic flavour			1
2/5 @entity18 : after eight @entity316 ( 18 mints ) the @entity318 of after - dinner mints — these are crisp , subtle and individually wrapped			2
if you want your guests to return for seconds , head to @entity18			0
5/5 crisps @entity11 : walkers ready salted ( five - pack ) a good brand name , but the @entity11 we visited stocked only ready salted flavour , which is disappointing			2
more choice would have been nice			0
2/5 @entity18 : @entity329 ( six - pack ) when it comes to the crunch , @entity18 clearly pips @entity11 to the post in terms of overall selection			1
the shelves are full of big name brands such as @entity329 and @entity337 ’s as well as several flavours of @entity292			0
4/5 pasta @entity11 : @entity340 twists 500g a reasonably sized 500g packet of pasta twists which , while never going to land you a place on @entity345 , made a mean pasta bake			0
4/5 @entity18 : @entity347 ( 2 packs for £ 1 ) it ’s a store cupboard staple but @entity18 did n’t have any plain pasta in stock on the day we visited — just these portion packs			0
available in cheese and broccoli or cheese , leek and ham — all of which tasted like cheap ready meals			0
1/5 music @entity11 : @entity363 ( 2 - cd compilation ) includes hits by a wide range of artists , including @entity368 , and @entity369			2
however , in general @entity11 ’s pound zone cd collection was small — this was the best of the bunch			2
2/5 @entity18 : @entity372 ( 2 - cd compilation ) boasts @entity375 and @entity376 ! for the perfect party playlist			2
@entity18 ’s policy of ‘ refurbishing ’ second - hand cds means you can also pick up more recent releases from big names such as @entity383			2

middle class shoppers looking for *imaginative* ways to *stretch* their *budget*
so @entity11 is rolling out ' pound zones ' in 300 of its stores to win back cost - *conscious* *consumers*
but will the supermarket giant be able to beat @entity18 at its own game ?
