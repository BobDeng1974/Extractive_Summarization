object of desire : @entity2 in his @entity4 advert when @entity6 revealed he had bulimia , the world laughed			1
yes , eating disorders are funny			0
who knew ? the former deputy prime minister had revealed his struggle , no doubt hoping to help others blighted by the condition			2
but one award - winning political commentator declared a misdiagnosis , saying @entity6 was ‘ more likely just a greedy incompetent , who gobbled every treat going ’			1
this was n’t an isolated jibe			0
feminist website @entity21 produced a @entity23 was eating … @entity25 – complete with fat and carbohydrate content			0
would women be spoken about like this ? would it be tolerated ? no way			2
i thought back to @entity6 ’s revelation in 2008 during the recent uproar over @entity35 , which launched an advertising campaign called the @entity37 , showcasing the variety of underwear it sells			1
women were outraged , it seems , because all the models were lithe and toned			2
@entity46 advertising trade publication @entity44 reported that within days of posters going up , 10,000 people had signed a petition demanding the company ‘ apologise for and amend the irresponsible marketing of your new bra range ’			2
complainants said the advert played on women ’s insecurities , sent out damaging messages , and failed to celebrate diversity			1
can you imagine if men made a similar response to the @entity2 posters for @entity4 ? many of the same women who later went on to denounce @entity35 used their newspaper columns to leer at the images in ways that would make a builder blush			1
‘ well done @entity4 on that autumn ad campaign			1
i ’ve spent most of the past fortnight alternately lusting over @entity2 in his pants and that orange coat			1
but mainly @entity2 , ’ said one			1
a broadsheet interviewer spent an entire article making jokes such as : ‘ i ’ve just buried my face in @entity2 ’s underpants … it was heaven			1
’ and one famous feminist added : ‘ it ’s nice to see that objectification sometimes runs both ways			0
’ uproar : when @entity35 launched a campaign called @entity86 ' , women were outraged but a diet of @entity88 and @entity2 , or whichever @entity90 muscle man of the moment is gracing the cover of @entity93 , is unarguably as damaging to male self - perception as the perfect body is to females			1
more than 1.6million @entity98 suffer an eating disorder , ten per cent of whom are men			2
we have to contend with ‘ bigorexia ’ , which sees men pump their bodies with hormones and protein shakes to get a bigger chest and arms			0
one leading rugby coach told me that anabolic steroid abuse was endemic among teenage players , desperate to emulate the muscular physiques of their sporting heroes			0
and at least two @entity98 teenage boys have died over the past few years after taking the banned slimming pill called @entity118			0
one was apparently trying to get a ‘ six - pack ’			0
ultimately , there is a wider malaise surrounding male health in general			0
not only is there a lack of empathy for our health concerns , there is also a lack of medical care			0
for example , women are screened for breast , ovarian and cervical cancer , which is great			0
but there ’s no screening programme for prostate cancer , even though it kills four times more men than cervical cancer does women			1
ridiculed : labour peer @entity6 revealed he had bulimia in 2008 research from @entity145 illustrates that men are 16 per cent more likely to develop every form of unisex cancer in the first place , then 40 per cent more likely to die from it			1
despite cases of oral cancer having risen by 50 per cent among @entity98 men since 1989 – accounting for almost 2,000 deaths annually – there is no vaccination for young men against @entity158 , which causes it			0
between 2007 and 2012 , @entity165 in the @entity167 boroughs of @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 ‘ spent £ 4,830,095 commissioning women ’s services outside the @entity162 … and nothing on men ’s ’			1
it ’s a trend that is visible nationally , with female care almost constantly ranked above that of men			0
rather than being the subject of sympathetic public concern or the odd fundraising gala , men are repeatedly told it ’s all their fault			0
but in truth , men are n’t dying sooner because they ’re ignorant or proud			0
when men do n’t discuss their health concerns it ’s not because they ’re wired this way – it ’s because if they say anything , they ’ll be greeted with shaming tactics to stop them , just like @entity6			1
i shall leave it to dr @entity206 , professor of @entity207 at @entity167 ’s @entity208 , to summarise : ‘ compared to women , men have shorter markers of longevity , called telomeres – suggesting there ’ll always be a biological difference [ which justifies the need for men to get greater care ]			1
the state needs to realise men are discriminated against by the set - up of the current @entity98 system			2
’ i could n’t have said it better myself			0
@entity211 , by @entity212 , is published this week by @entity213 , priced £ 16.99 .			2

when @entity6 revealed he suffered from bulimia , he was ridiculed
but recently , feminists complained that a @entity35 ***'s*** ad played on women ***'s*** insecurities and sent out damaging messages
there was no similar outcry over @entity2 ***'s*** steamy @entity4 posters
but @entity212 claims ' muscle men ' are unarguably as damaging to male self - perception as the perfect body is to females
in a *controversial* new book , he claims men are the real *victims* of sexism
