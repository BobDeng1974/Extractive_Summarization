@entity11 was given a standing ovation on saturday as he took charge of @entity3 for the first time , just five days after @entity9 was fired			1

@entity28 has been hiding at his holiday home at @entity37 , a 500 - hectare luxury resort on @entity38 ’s @entity125 coast , with hundreds of villas , 15 restaurants , two golf courses , a supermarket and a nightclub			1
the 61 - year - old has a villa here			0

hideaway : @entity28 has been staying in his holiday home , a 500 - hectare luxury resort on the @entity125 coast relaxing : @entity28 plays at the @entity141 as often as he can when holidaying in @entity38 @entity28 does not take kindly to people showing up on his doorstep unannounced , although presumably @entity3 ’s representatives would have been more than welcome			1
after two days searching for the most coveted manager in @entity153 football , i finally find him when a silver 4x4 pulls up on one of the plushest streets in the resort , where properties cost upwards of € 2million			2
@entity28 appears from the rear seats together with his wife , @entity161			1
wearing a pale pink shirt , smart trousers and oversized sunglasses , he turns to say goodbye to the @entity153 couple who have dropped them off and reluctantly shakes my hand			0
the house on the sprawling plot next to @entity28 ’s has been knocked down and a new one is being built			2
@entity28 has red cement dust blowing in his face and my introductions are muffled by the noise of a digger			2
can i have a quick word , @entity178 ? ‘ no ! ’ he scowls			0
but can we expect to see you in @entity153 next season ? no response			2
do you think you ’ll go to @entity3 ? ‘ i ’m sorry i ca n’t talk about it			2
’ why not , @entity178 ? ‘ i ca n’t say anything because everything i say will be interpreted as what they want			0
@entity192 are here and it ’s not nice because i ’m here for holidays and it ’s my last week before the @entity67			0
’ and with that , @entity28 disappears behind the iron gates of his property			2
without a care in the world : @entity28 concentrates as he lines up a putt on the golf course nice people : one waiter said @entity28 is very serious but ' not too picky , not too demanding ' he is well known around the resort			2
he is regarded as a ‘ good tipper ’ at the @entity204 and he and his family are also popular customers at the @entity207			0
in the summer months , he requests a table overlooking the sea and orders his favourite dish , crispy aromatic duck , at a slightly pricey € 19.50			0
‘ he is very serious , ’ said a waiter , ‘ but they ’re very nice people , not too picky , not too demanding			0
