by @entity0 the instant messaging war is well and truly upon us			0
following major announcements from @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and others , @entity3 has revealed its own ‘ chat ’ feature			1
users within the popular image - sharing app can now message friends and make live video calls			1
you can also now share live video with them ( pictured ) to make quick and instant calls the update for the app is being released today on @entity26 and @entity27			1
the new feature , dubbed chat , continues @entity3 ’s theme of being quick , easy and simple			1
with just a swipe you ’ll be able to privately message your friends			2
to use chat , you simply load up the app as usual			2
when in your @entity3 inbox , you then swipe right on a friend ’s name to send then a written message			1
the messages work like a regular @entity42 , and will be deleted after both of you have seen it and quit your respective chat screens			1
there is a button that lets you save important information , though , or of course you can always take a screenshot			0
if you and your friend happen to be chatting at the same time the app will alert you by saying they are ‘ here ’ on the screen			0
then , pressing and holding the screen will let you chat face to face instantly			0
holding the top of the screen will show your friend the view out of the camera on the back of your phone			0
touching the bottom of the screen will switch to the front camera , so you can show them a quick video selfie if you want			2
the latest update follows the previous change , which added stories to @entity3			1
this enabled users to have an image on their profile available for viewing for 24 hours			0
the chat feature , though , seems to be a clear rebuttal to moves from @entity3 ’s rivals			1
@entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and possible even @entity80 have all made moves in the instant messaging field in the past few months			0
@entity3 's move seems to be an attempt to ensure they hang onto their chunk of the lucrative photo and text communication market			2
at the end of 2013 it was estimated that @entity3 had over 26 million users in the @entity92 alone , with many others around the world			2
and in a survey of @entity92 college students in february , 77 % said they used @entity3 on a daily basis			0
but the company still apparently holds only 5 % of the ' selfie ' market , with this move perhaps an attempt to keep them in the game			0
to use @entity3 's new chat feature ( pictured ) you simply need to swipe right on one of your friend 's names in the app 's inbox			1
messages are deleted when you both quit the chat window you can activate the front ( left ) and rear ( right ) cameras on your device by dragging your finger to the bottom and top of your phone respectively back in february @entity5 bought hugely popular messaging app @entity121 for $ 19 billion ( £ 11.4 billion ) , after failing in a previous $ 3 billion to buy @entity3			1
at the start of april , @entity6 revealed its ‘ @entity128 ’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other			2
this directly followed once - popular social network @entity7 ’s attempts to get back into the game with @entity132 , their own video messaging service			1
@entity5 , meanwhile , is busy trying to increase the profile of its @entity136 app , with rumours that it will shift @entity121 users onto its native messaging client			0
they recently announced a selfie feature for messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself			0
and even @entity80 is getting in on the game – it ’s rumoured they are considering letting users have secret conversations on the site .			0
