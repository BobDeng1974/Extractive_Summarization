by @entity0 published : 04:33 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 04:53 est , 5 april 2013 ancient warriors were far more adept at making bronze weapons that previously thought , a new analysis of a huge battering ram on a 2,000 year - old warship has found			1
known as the @entity7 , the 20kg artefact was discovered by a group of @entity10 divers off the coast of @entity12 near @entity13 in 1964			1
a @entity10 team has now completed the first analysis and 3d scan of the ram - and say it was cast in a single piece using advanced techniques for the time			1
known as the @entity7 , the 20kg artefact was discovered by a group of @entity10 divers off the coast of @entity12 near @entity13 in 1964 an artist 's impression of the @entity7 bow on the from of a ship the @entity27 was found by a group of three @entity10 service sports divers off the coast of @entity12 at the mouth of a valley called @entity33 , near @entity13			1
using a rubber dinghy and rope they dragged it 25 metres to the surface			0
it was brought home to the @entity10 as a souvenir but when the divers discovered that it was a rare antiquity , the ram was loaned to the @entity44 , @entity45			1
@entity46 is the only surviving member of that group of three and the effective owner			1
he decided in 2007 that is should be returned to a museum in @entity12			1
with the help of the @entity53 for @entity12 studies this was arranged in 2010			1
the @entity12 uprising of 2011 resulted in many battles in the area around the museum , but fortunately the museum suffered no damage			1
the ram is from a small @entity61 or @entity62 warship â€“ a ' tesseraria '			1
these ships were equipped with massive bronze rams on the bow at the waterline and were used for ramming the side timbers of enemy ships			0
at 65cm long , the @entity7 is smaller in size and would have been sited on the upper level on the bow			0
this second ram is known as a proembolion , which strengthened the bow and also served to break the oars of an enemy ship			2
dr @entity77 a visiting fellow of the @entity79 , co-ordinated a team of specialists from five institutes to analyse the artefact before it was returned to the @entity84 in @entity85 in may 2010			2
experts were stunned to find it was made in one piece			1
' casting a large alloy object weighing more than 20kg is not easy			2
' to find out how it was done we needed specialists who could analyse the mix of metals in the alloys ; experts who could study the internal crystal structure and the distribution of gas bubbles ; and scholars who could examine the classical literature and other known examples of bronze castings			2
a series of experts analysed the ram			1
dr @entity106 and @entity107 of @entity108 used radiocarbon dating of burnt wood found inside the ram to date it to between 100 @entity112 to 100 ad			2
this date is consistent with the decorative style of the tridents and bird motive on the top of the ram , which were revealed in detail by laser - scanned images taken by archaeologist dr @entity121 of the @entity122			1
the x-ray team produced a @entity125 image of the ram 's internal structure using a machine capable of generating x-rays of 10 mevs to shine through 15cm of solid bronze			2
by rotating the ram on a turntable and making 360 images they created a complete @entity125 replica of the ram similar to a medical ct scan			2
the revealed it it is possible that during its early history the bronze would have been remelted and mixed with other bronze on one or more occasions , perhaps when a warship was repaired or maybe captured			0
further analysis was carried out by geochemists professor @entity148 , dr @entity149 and dr @entity150 at the @entity151 and @entity152 ( based at the @entity79 )			0
an x-ray image of the ram revealed the 3 fins porosity , allowing researchers to work out how it was made micro-drilled samples show that the composition of the bronze was 87 per cent copper , 6 per cent tin and 7 per cent lead			1
the concentrations of the different metals vary throughout the casting			0
these results indicate the likelihood that the @entity27 was cast in one piece and cooled as a single object , the team say			0
the thicker parts cooled more slowly than the thin parts so that the crystal structure and number of bubbles trapped in the metal varies from place to place			0
however , the researchers admit thy still do now know how the ram ended up on the seabed			1
' we will never know why the @entity27 was on the seabed near @entity13			1
' there may have been a battle in the area , a skirmish with pirates			0
it could be that it was cargo from an ancient commercial vessel , about to be sold as salvage			0
' the fragments of wood inside the ram show signs of fire , and we now know that parts of the bronze had been heated to a high temperature since it was cast which caused the crystal structure to change			2
' the ship may have caught fire and the ram fell into the sea as the flames licked towards it			0
some things will always remain a mystery			0
' but we are pleased that we have gleaned so many details from this study that will help future work			0
' a painting believed to show the boat the ram was attached to their results have been published in the @entity219 of @entity220			0
' although the @entity7 was probably the first one ever found , other rams have since been found off the coast of @entity224 and off western @entity225			0
' we have built a body of expertise and techniques that will help with future studies of these objects and improve the accuracy of past analysis			0

20kg artefact discovered by a group of @entity10 divers off the coast of @entity12 near @entity13 in 1964
researchers have now analysed and @entity241 scanned the ram to find out how it was made
