@entity5 subjected his terrified victims to horrific ordeals during a series of violent burglaries in south @entity13 in the late 1980s			1
at the time , the crimes sparked nationwide outrage and mass media coverage but @entity5 eluded capture			1
he has also been nicknamed ‘ the @entity55 ’ after crossing himself and uttering the words from the @entity52 prayer for the dead during one attack			0
@entity5 was caught because he had given a dna sample after attacking an elderly man in his own home			1
dna matches from the scene threw up a partial match to his dna in 2005 and it was realised he fitted a description of his now dead victims			2
in addition his methods of attack matched that of some of his other many crimes which did not involve violence			0
@entity5 struck for the first time on @entity72 1988 , breaking into the home of a 57 - year - old woman in @entity75 , @entity25 - 800 yards from his then home in @entity77			1
the woman was a virgin who had mobility problems			0

the addresses of the third and fourth victims were within 300 yards of his address at the time in @entity103 ’ road			0
jurors unanimously convicted @entity5 of three rapes and the brutal beating of a fourth victim following a short trial last month			1
although he was only tried for four attacks , he has been blamed for other similar crimes during the same period , including the rape and murder of 68 - year - old @entity113			1
the grandmother was sexually attacked and stabbed to death with a kitchen knife on may 31 , 1990			0
her body lay undiscovered for six weeks at her council maisonette in @entity90 , may 31 , 1990			0
after the jury delivered its verdicts the court heard @entity5 had been linked to two other violent attacks on victims aged 68 and 78 in 1989			1
but the murder of mrs @entity113 remained unsolved			0
judge @entity29 , likening the case to the case of ‘ @entity127 ’ @entity128 and said : ‘ your depravity knows no bounds			2
‘ these are very grave offences			0
the victims of your offences were all elderly			0
you broke into their houses and in the middle of the night			0
‘ you then proceeded to submit them to humiliating and degrading sexual attacks and , unlike @entity128 , your offences are aggravated and marked by terrible violence			0
‘ i ’m quite satisfied that you are a danger to society therefore i do sentence you to imprisonment for the rest if your natural life			1
’ @entity5 appeared in the dock wearing light beige trousers and a black shirt			1
he evaded capture hiding a distinctive scar on his forehead from his victims by wearing his hair in a floppy fringe and warning the victims not to look at his face			2
but other features gave him away , including his back , which one of the women accurately said was covered in brown marks and moles , and his clothing , including a dirty green tracksuit			0
his fourth victim was so badly beaten that she remembered nothing about her attacker			0
@entity5 confessed that assault to his girlfriend at the time after hearing it reported on the radio , the jury heard			2
jurors at @entity25 unanimously convicted @entity5 of three rapes and the brutal beating of a fourth victim following a short trial last month @entity176 recovered from the attacker ’s semen and saliva from cigarettes he smoked only provided ‘ partial ’ matches to @entity5 ’ profile , with a one in 79,000 chance that it did not come from him in one sample down to as much as a one in 16 chance in another			2
but prosecutor @entity185 said all the evidence taken together , with partial matches found at three different scenes , alongside the visual identifications , the confession to his girlfriend and other circumstantial evidence , the jury could be sure he was the attacker			0
judge @entity29 likened the case to the ' @entity127 ' @entity128 , pictured , who attacked pensioners over 17 years @entity5 lived within a few hundred yards of all four victims , and staked out their homes prior to the attacks			1
he chose elderly woman living alone in ground floor flats , and attacked them in their homes late at night before making off with small amounts of cash and jewellery			0
his victims described how he smelled strongly of alcohol , and told one of them he had been at the pub before the attack			0
the jury heard evidence from the two women @entity5 lived with during the period of the attacks - @entity217 and @entity218			1
he had been violent to both women and @entity220 described in a statement how he was a petty criminal who would often return home late at night with handbags he had stolen			0
she told the court he used to scan newspapers for coverage of his exploits , believing at the time that he was referring to lesser crimes			0
miss @entity218 also said she remembered he owned a pale green tracksuit similar to that described by one of the victims			0
miss @entity217 said that after hearing about the fourth attack on the radio , the savage beating of an 83 - year - old woman , he told her : ‘ i did that , but i did n’t rape her			2
’ although he did not give evidence during the trial , @entity5 ’ barrister @entity242 , @entity243 , told the jury in his closing speech that the @entity248 had not produced enough evidence to prove he had committed the offences			2
@entity5 , formerly of @entity251 , @entity90 , was convicted of three counts of rape , four counts of burglary , two counts of indecent assault , two counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent , and one count of buggery			1
speaking outside court , a son of one of his victims said : ' today ’s sentence for the families is absolutely brilliant			2
he deserves everything he got			0
' detective inspector @entity267 , one of the investigating officers on the case , said : ' @entity5 is a sexual predator who preyed on vulnerable women in the late 80s and early 90s			1
' unfortunately none of his victims lived to see him being brought to justice today but the family members of the victims have expressed deep satisfaction with handed down today			2
