winner : olympic gold medallist @entity1 was celebrated in the @entity2			1
his fame has n't swayed @entity5 customs officials who still insisted on going through checks even after seeing his medals as one of the most famous athletes in the world , getting recognised can be a problem for @entity1			1
everywhere except in @entity5 airports , that is			1
for more than a year after his double gold medal triumph at @entity18 , the @entity16 star is still ' always ' pulled aside by suspicious @entity5 customs officials - because his full name is @entity20 , he said today			1
even showing them his medals does not stop them suspecting he is a terrorist and questioning him			0
but the runner also told how it is impossible for him to train in @entity25 - because he is too well known and would get mobbed by fans			2
@entity27 , who moved to @entity28 , @entity29 , two years ago to work with coach @entity31 , said : ' i 'm always stopped by @entity5 customs			1
i think it 's something to do with my name , that 's the only thing i can put together			2
' i always get stopped and get questioned			0
it used to be really bad where you 'd get stopped and go through to a room and they 'd do an extra search - " what are you doing here ? how many countries you been to ? "			0
' asked if he 'd ever been tempted to show them his 5,000m and 10,000m gold medals , he said : ' i did at one point when i was coming through and they were like " no matter , i still need to do this search "			2
' @entity53 - born @entity27 , 30 , who moved to the @entity25 with his @entity25 - born father at eight , remains sanguine about the situation , however , and believes it is down to ' the system on the computer '			1
interviewed on @entity61 's @entity62 , he said : ' when i was coming here even , i was trying to check in and it wo n't let me check in so i go to the lady and ask her to check in and then she had to make a special call			0
' before you actually check in you have to make a call to make sure you 're clear then you check in			0
i always have a fair problem			0
' pride : @entity27 celebrated winning the men 's 5000metre event , his second gold medal at @entity18 , by draping himself in the @entity77 flag do the @entity78 : @entity27 was recognised for his ' @entity78 ' sign during the olympic games previously it has been reported that @entity27 , who was awarded a cbe in the @entity84 , was hauled aside at customs as he returned to his training base in @entity29 just before last @entity88			1
afterwards , he said : ' i even got my medals out to show who i am , but they would n't have it			0
' he was eventually allowed into the @entity5			2
@entity27 , who trains in @entity93 as well as the @entity5 , also told how despite his love of the fans who cheered him on to double @entity16 glory , he could not train in the @entity25 because his fame and the attention it brings would interrupt his strict regime			1
' it 's not possible for me to train in @entity25 because of the amount of miles i do			2
i love the people , i love the support and i want to be here , but if i want to win medals i need the simple life - eat , sleep , train , not worry about anything else , ' he said			0
training : the athlete , pictured here winning the 5000metres at the @entity113 in @entity114 , moved to @entity5 two years ago to train world champion : @entity1 , pictured here winning the 3000metres at the @entity117 in @entity118 , is a household name and recognisable figure to many but still gets challenged at @entity5 airports ' unfortunately i ca n't do that right now			1
but i will be back at some point			0
' @entity27 is currently in the @entity25 promoting his autobiography @entity124			2
while he was being brought up in the @entity25 , his twin brother @entity126 was 6000 miles away in @entity53			0
although they were separated until he went to his brother 's wedding in 2003 , @entity27 says they have since been in touch every day and ' the way i see it we are not different people , we are part of the same person '			1
he added : ' i made him run with me in 2003			0
i was quite amused because he almost kept up with me for a little while			0
' @entity27 's ' new goal ' is to prove himself as a marathon runner in next year 's @entity142 , but he dismissed reports he 'd said he could cover the 26.2 miles in under two hours			1
' to say i 'm going to break two hours when i 've never run a marathon is crazy , ' said @entity27 , who ran half the event this year as preparation for his full debut in 2014			1
' my target is to get close to the @entity25 record which is 2 minutes 7 seconds			0

double gold medal winner @entity1 says @entity5 customs officials always pull him aside
@entity27 said he believes it 's because his full named is @entity20
the @entity16 star moved to @entity28 , @entity29 , two years ago to train out of the *spotlight*
