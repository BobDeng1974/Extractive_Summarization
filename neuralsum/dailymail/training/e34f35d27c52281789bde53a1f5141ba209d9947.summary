by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 follow @ @ @entity3 @entity4 will be given a shock call - up to @entity8 ’s @entity7 squad if injury shatters @entity11 ’s dream of going to @entity12			1
the @entity14 defender made his @entity16 debut only last september and has not figured in any of the squads @entity18 has named this season			1
but he has starred for the under 21s and @entity21 understands that @entity18 will turn to the 19 - year - old if @entity11 is ruled out			2
only 18 months ago , @entity23 was playing for his hometown club @entity24 before moving to @entity14 for £ 2million			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity23 score against @entity28 and @entity18 on @entity8 fast track : @entity4 ( c ) will get a @entity7 call - up if @entity11 fails to recover from injury teenage kicks : the 19 - year - old has been impressive at @entity14 since his £ 3million move from @entity24 @entity11 was forced off early during @entity36 ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity37 on tuesday with a serious shoulder problem			1
his club have yet to release an official bulletin on the damage but it was initially suspected to be a dislocation			0
@entity36 caretaker manager @entity43 said after the game ‘ it did n’t look good ’			2
@entity18 , who will unveil his 23 - man party on monday , watched stones in action at @entity49 last weekend when @entity14 were beaten 3 - 2 by @entity50			1
former @entity8 striker @entity51 has urged @entity18 to take the gamble on @entity23			2
‘ i really like him , ’ said @entity51			0
‘ he has got a lot about him			0
sometimes central defenders need a bit more experience because of the extra discipline and nature of that role			0
but is he worth a gamble ? well , if @entity11 does n’t make it — what else have we got ? ’ @entity65 manager @entity64 has admitted the next few days will determine if @entity66 will be fit for the @entity7			1
that 's torn it ! @entity11 ( c ) is waiting on results after appearing to dislocate his shoulder against @entity37 @entity66 returned to @entity65 training yesterday and came through unscathed , but he is still troubled by a groin problem			1
@entity64 is not counting on him for the @entity74 final on saturday week and admits he will have to rule the 20 - year - old midfielder out of @entity12 if the problem flares up			1
‘ his time is getting short now but i am still convinced he can do it if he gets over the next hurdle , ’ said @entity64			0
i do n’t believe he will need surgery			0
we will stop him before that			0
if he gets over the next three or four days and he has no pain , he will be available for @entity12			2
if he does n’t , it becomes more doubtful			0
sweating : @entity66 faces a nervous wait to find out if he 'll be fit for @entity12 will they , wo n't they ? @entity91 rivals @entity92 ( @entity93 ) and @entity94 ( r ) are @entity8 's other doubts ‘ he is desperate to go but we are in a job where your body responds or it does n’t			1
he can only go to the @entity7 if he is completely fit			2
it would n’t be helpful for @entity8 for him to go there and not be 100 per cent			2
’ it would be a huge blow for @entity18 , who has already lost wingers @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 to injuries			0
@entity92 , out with an ankle injury since march , is expected to return to the @entity65 squad for sunday ’s game at @entity113 , but is not certain to start			1
and @entity116 right back @entity94 , who has been out for two months with a groin injury , is not likely to feature in their final game of the season			1
unleash the cubs ! @entity120 ( c ) has urged @entity8 to go with youth after taking @entity122 ( @entity93 ) and @entity123 ( r ) to the @entity124 meanwhile , former @entity8 manager @entity120 has backed @entity21 ’s campaign calling for @entity18 to unleash the @entity126			1
@entity120 , who was speaking at a @entity7 event for @entity128 , said : ‘ we have seen some electrifying prospects over the years			1
i was very fortunate to have a young @entity122 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity123			0
they were four fantastic players			0
‘ did they know everything then ? no. were they as good then as they eventually became ? no. they grew and gained experience			0
‘ @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 will be so much better for the experience of going to the @entity7			0

@entity14 defender @entity4 will get a @entity7 call up if @entity11 fails to recover from injury
@entity11 is awaiting test results after appearing to dislocate his shoulder in @entity36 's 3 - 1 defeat of @entity37
@entity66 faces a fitness race to book his place to @entity12
@entity92 and @entity94 *remain* doubtful to make the final squad
@entity120 has urged @entity8 to take young players , like he did in 1998
