by @entity1 reporter published : 17:54 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 07:17 est , 8 march 2014 ' illustrious horsewoman ' @entity3 facing £ 150k bill for selling a mount ' not fit for purpose in 2007 a champion showjumper sold one of her riding pupils an elderly horse that was ‘ ready for the knacker ’s yard ’ , a court heard			1
@entity15 claims the ‘ defective ’ horse had to be put down just months after he bought it from three - day eventer @entity19			1
miss @entity3 now faces a huge £ 150,000 bill for legal costs after senior judges upheld mr @entity15 ’s second appeal , after he lost the original case			1
mr @entity15 , a financial adviser , of @entity26 , @entity27 , launched court action against ‘ illustrious horsewoman ’ miss @entity3 , a previous winner of the @entity32 horse trials , claiming she sold him a mount which was ‘ unfit for purpose ’ , in 2007			1
however , miss @entity3 , who runs a riding stable at @entity35 , @entity36 , insisted she had never owned the horse – a 14 - year - old hunter named @entity39 – and that she merely acted as an agent for mr @entity15 in the purchase , at his request			1
she denied any responsibility for @entity39 ’s state of health or that he ‘ lacked merchantable quality at the time of sale or was unfit for purpose ’			0
mr @entity15 lost the argument after two court hearings , but senior judges in @entity51 have now upheld his appeal , opening a new chapter in the enormously costly legal saga			2
@entity56 judge , sir @entity55 , decried the legal costs of the case – estimated at £ 150,000			0
‘ this is in many ways a sad case			0
the claim is for less than £ 9,000 , ’ he observed			0
‘ we are now hearing a second appeal in this case - in which the costs by now must inevitably be many times the value of the claim			0
’ @entity70 , for mr @entity15 , said his client had asked miss @entity3 to ‘ keep an eye out ’ for a suitable mount for him to use as a novice in eventing and initially agreed to pay £ 5,000 for @entity39 in the belief that he was an 11 - year - old			1
he added that mr @entity15 , 55 , later dropped the price to £ 2,750 after seeing the horse ’s papers and learning he was 14			2
after buying and riding the horse , mr @entity15 found it had an ‘ abnormal hopping gait ’ , which caused him to occasionally lose balance while riding			1
mr @entity84 said : ‘ the horse went lame shortly after mr @entity15 bought it and was put out to grass thereafter			1
’ after a vet declared @entity39 unsuitable to ride , he was put down in june 2008 for medical reasons			0
mr @entity84 told the court that a post-mortem examination of the animal revealed that one of its front feet was bigger than the other			0
the barrister told the judges : ‘ mr @entity15 bought a horse which turned out to be of unsatisfactory quality and unfit for its purpose			2
‘ he says he bought it from @entity102 in the course of her business as a horse trainer and occasional dealer and that the sale was therefore subject to the statutory implied terms as to quality and fitness			0
’ @entity15 ( pictured with his wife left ) claims the horse had to be put down just months after he bought it from the three - day eventer ( right ) @entity115 , for @entity102 , told the court that the showjumper did not own the horse and that mr @entity15 should have known that			1
‘ though an illustrious horsewoman , with considerable equine knowledge , miss @entity3 was merely seeking to help him find a horse in response to requests that she source one for him , ’ the barrister said			2
at the original hearing , a judge found in favour of @entity102 , who regularly competes at @entity129			0
mr @entity15 appealed but this was dismissed by a county court judge			2
sir @entity55 , sitting with sir @entity133 and @entity134 , said the ‘ vital points ’ in deciding the case were ‘ the nature of the agreement and whether the horse was in fact defective ’			0
allowing mr @entity15 ’s appeal and sending the case back to be re-heard , sir @entity55 concluded : ‘ there was no sensible finding of fact as to the condition of @entity39 at the point of sale			2
‘ i see no alternative but for the case to be remitted to the @entity150 for re-hearing by a different judge			0
’ outside court , mr @entity15 said : ‘ i would never have bought it if i had known what it was – it was ready for the knacker ’s yard			1
