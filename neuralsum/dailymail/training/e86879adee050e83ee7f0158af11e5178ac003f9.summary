by @entity0 @entity1 turned the clock back 28 years in putting holders @entity3 out of the @entity5 's @entity4 in an absorbing quarter - final at the @entity7			1
the @entity1 demonstrated their sparkling @entity9 form is no fluke by pulling off a thoroughly - deserved 16 - 4 triumph to inflict on @entity3 their first home @entity4 defeat since 1986			1
@entity1 were also the victors that day on their way to lifting the trophy at @entity17 for the last time and they now join @entity19 and @entity20 in the semi-final draw , which will be made after the last quarter - final between @entity23 and @entity24 on sunday			1
last four : @entity1 players celebrate after beating @entity3 16 - 4 to reach the @entity4 semi-finals roar ! @entity1 congratulate @entity27 ( c ) after his late try sealed victory at the @entity7 the @entity1 were clinging to a six - point lead when former @entity3 prop @entity27 burst through a tiring @entity32 defence to score his first try for the club on only his third appearance three minutes from the end to seal a famous victory			1
@entity3 coach @entity38 had accused the @entity39 of ' disrespect ' in the build - up but the @entity1 had every right to feel confident after winning their last two matches against the @entity32 and they were good value for the hat - trick			1
a downpour before kick - off made the handling difficult and no doubt contributed to a scrappy opening in which both teams squandered promising scoring positions by conceding penalties for obstruction , the rule that is seen as the current blight on the game			0
video referee @entity57 angered the big travelling contingent by disallowing a try to @entity1 full - back @entity60 on 28 minutes for the slightest of obstructions and produced ironic cheers when he gave the green light to winger @entity68 's touchdown two minutes later			2
diving in : @entity1 ' @entity69 goes over for a try past @entity3 @entity71 ( r ) it was the only try of the first half but the @entity1 could have had three or four with steadier finishing and a touch more luck			0
the visitors failed to make the most of clear breaks from right winger @entity69 and prop @entity80 , while a legal ball steal on @entity80 by @entity3 second rower @entity82 helped keep the @entity32 in the game by half - time despite being totally outplayed			0
spurred by @entity38 's interval pep talk , the holders visibly attempted to raise the pace of the game in the second half and they looked more threatening teenage wing sensation @entity91 , one of nine @entity3 players called into the @entity94 squad , failed to take @entity96 's pass with the line beckoning and skipper @entity98 got over the line only to have the ball knocked from his grasp			0
sandwich : @entity3 's @entity103 is tackled by @entity1 's @entity104 ( @entity105 ) and @entity80 ( r ) @entity1 were forced to scramble heroically to keep their line intact and were especially grateful to forward @entity107 for a last - ditch tackle on @entity103 after @entity109 came up with a half - break			1
@entity98 , @entity111 and @entity112 were all held up agonisingly short but the pressure finally told on 62 minutes when @entity96 took @entity103 ' pass 15 metres out and spun out of a two - man tackle to touch down for @entity3 's 100th try of the season			2
however , the holders failed to draw level when @entity121 's conversion attempt went wide and with that went their last chance to keep their hold on the trophy			0
the @entity1 had spurned a clear - cut chance when @entity60 sliced through the first line of defence but captain @entity129 could not take his pass cleanly			0
catch me ! @entity1 's @entity60 skips away from @entity3 's @entity112 ( c ) and @entity132 ( r ) however , they demonstrated slicker finishing 11 minutes from the end to seal a memorable win			1
@entity60 once more linked effectively from deep and centre @entity104 came up with a superb one - handed flick pass which was taken brilliantly by his winger @entity69 , who went over for all - important try			0
@entity140 could not add the goal but @entity1 made sure when @entity27 , who joined the club last month from @entity144 club @entity143 , charged over for his side 's third try , with @entity140 kicking his second goal			2
@entity3 finished a well - beaten side but will not have to wait to get their revenge , with the two teams meeting in @entity9 at the @entity7 next friday .			0

@entity1 defeated @entity3 16 - 4 in the @entity5 's @entity4 quarter finals
@entity1 join @entity19 and @entity20 in the semi-final draw
@entity27 sealed victory with his first ever try in the dying minutes
