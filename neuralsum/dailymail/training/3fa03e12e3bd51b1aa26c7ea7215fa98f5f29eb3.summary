on a mission : a @entity2 crewman heads out to attack is targets @entity5 airstrikes against @entity7 militants are being conducted by morale - sapped pilots who are using broken equipment , claims an @entity12 serviceman			1
the insider said @entity14 in @entity15 was being neglected , morale was poor and ground crews had been forced to eat humanitarian rations meant for @entity18			1
in a strongly - worded letter it was said that there is no hospital at the base – even though there are daily operations involving live ammunition			1
in the letter to @entity30 ’s @entity29 , the serviceman alleged that ‘ the costs and quality of the catering and retail support are a disgrace ’ and that crews there are led by a chain of command ‘ so laced with budgetary fear … that no one knows what the plan is ’			1
it was also claimed that because services were undertaken by private contractors , @entity15 cleaners at the base were being charged to the @entity5 taxpayers at three times the annual cost of an airman ’s salary			1
an @entity12 spokesman dismissed many of the claims , saying : ‘ in our opinion this letter is factually inaccurate			1
in layman ’s terms , it is completely full of holes			2
’ but a @entity60 source confirmed that an incident in which ground crew had been given aid rations had taken place			2
during a recent visit to the base by an air vice-marshal , one sergeant from @entity68 complained about the quality of the food available to crews working overnight on @entity2 jets			2
the officer was said to have been so disgusted by the cheese sandwiches offered as meals to the night shift , he broke into a pallet of rations intended for dropping to refugees in northern @entity18 and handed it out			2
the serviceman ’s letter added : ‘ it was better than what we were feeding our airmen			2
’ @entity29 reported that due to their age , the battle to keep some of the eight @entity89 at the base airworthy has required long hours of work by ground crews , particularly on the engines			0
on many days , just two or three of the jets are available for missions over @entity18			0
the tornado , which has undergone numerous upgrades , has been in service with the @entity12 for more than 30 years			0
however , the @entity60 source insisted that the jet ‘ continues to offer good serviceability and is meeting required tasking ’			0
many @entity12 personnel are said to be exhausted after years of continuous deployments			0
although an @entity60 source said facilities at @entity14 are comparable with @entity12 stations around the world , conditions are reported to be worse than those that personnel had experienced on operations in @entity115			1
hot meals are only served during the day , with snacks provided at night			0
above , two @entity2 fighter jets prepare to land at @entity14 a crew member stands on top of one of the jets at the air base in @entity15 where , according to one serviceman , conditions are worse than those in @entity115 responding to suggestions that personnel are poorly fed , the @entity60 source said ‘ crews were offered a small number of excess rations [ a vegetarian curry ] as a one - off gesture during a testing deployment ’ , and argued there was no question of the crews needing the humanitarian rations in order to be ‘ adequately fed ’			1
shortly after operations began against @entity7 in september , the number of @entity2 fighter bombers was increased from six to eight			0
@entity29 reported this increase was necessary in order to ensure there were always two aircraft available for bombing missions			0
@entity12 @entity89 are flying daily missions over @entity18 , identifying and destroying is strongpoints and weaponry .			0
