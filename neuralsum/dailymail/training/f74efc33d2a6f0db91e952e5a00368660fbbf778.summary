one of @entity1 's earliest memories was seeing her father being taken away by the police after they stormed into her home to arrest him on rape charges			1
he was later jailed leaving @entity1 with a dysfunctional mother who suffered from nervous breakdowns			1
but @entity1 , now 36 , told @entity8 she did n't miss her father as he was a violent man who regularly battered her mother , who once even jumped through a glass window to escape him			1
misspent youth : @entity1 was part of a gang and was jailed for robbery as a teenager the teenager then had a step father who she was so scared of , she slept with a knife under her pillow			1
so it is perhaps no surprise that by the age of 13 , @entity1 had sought solace by being part of a gang , and she would rather be out with them as they terrorised the streets of @entity29 , @entity30 , than at home			1
' the whole vibe of the gang seemed quite exciting , ' she explained			1
. she joined the notorious ' @entity33 ' becoming involved in robberies , drug dealing and violence			2
she recalled : ' i used to go along on some of the robberies just for the hell of it			2
police called it " steaming "			2
they would run in , jump around the counter , grab money from the till and they were gone again			2
' reformed : now the mother - of - two wants to help other young people out of a life of crime she started to arm herself with the knife she once kept under her pillow , threatening to stab a girl at her school which led to her being expelled			1
she admits she was an aggressive youngster and would not hesitate in using her knife if she became involved in an altercation			1
as a result , arguments over the years led to her stabbing her sister in the leg and her boyfriend in the abdomen on different occasions			1
' i feel the most remorse for that , ' she admits			2
' i see these people on a normal day and it hurts me to know what i did to them			1
' during this time , @entity1 was also a victim herself , as she was raped at the age of 15			1
she shares this horrific experience in her memoir , sour : my story , which has been published by @entity78 and shows how she survived gangland culture to eventually put her troubled past behind her			2
it was becoming pregnant with her daughter , @entity84 , now 16 , that led @entity1 to finally change her ways			1
aggressive : in her youth , @entity1 once stabbed her sister and her boyfriend			1
she 's written a book telling her story and how she became ' a changed person ' she said : ' trying to live a gang life as a 36 - year - old is n't possible			1
i have children and responsibilities			2
if you want to step away from gangs you can if you have strength of character			2
' she added that she has learnt to not lash out , even when provoked			2
' i have been in arguments since and i have controlled myself			2
unless my life was threatened , i would never harm someone again , ' she said			1
' i have been slapped in the face and not retaliated which shocked my friends			0
they said i would never let something like that go in the past			0
but i tell them , " i 'm a changed person "			0
' as well as @entity84 , she also has another , daughter , @entity115 , three , and she says she 's determined to be a good mother to them and keep them on the straight and narrow			1
she said : ' @entity84 is a very good kid			0
by the time i was 16 i had already been to prison			0
the contrast between us is mind - blowing			1
she says to me , " with respect , i would never turn out like you "			0
she knows i have survived a lot			0
' she added : ' i was aggressive , my past has shaped who i am now			0
now i am a very good mum			0
' now @entity1 , who still lives in @entity30 , mentors young people , encouraging them to steer clear of gangs			1
crime does n't pay : @entity1 hopes young people and parents can learn from her experiences she explained : ' i mentor children at schools and young offenders ' institutes or the children of friends			1
sometimes i just approach teenagers on the street and talk to them			0
i tell them not to hang around but to go home , the devil makes work for idle hands			0
' she believes she 's in a unique position to help troubled young people as she knows what they are going through - and is an example of how you can break the cycle of committing crime			1
she said : ' there are outlets if you need help			0
kids do n't like to be dictated to , i listen to them			0
when they trust you , you can give them alternatives views so they can see something negative in a positive light			0
i give them steps to work towards			0
' i understand what they are going through and they are often surprised when i tell them about my past			0
' @entity1 said she penned her book to illustrate these points but she also hopes it can change the views of parents and politicians if they read it			1
she said : ' children are byproducts of their environment			0
parents need to think about what their children are doing once they are out of their peripheral view			0
i want politicians to read my book and see from the inside what life is like for a troubled youngster			2
' i also want youngsters to know it 's a fallacy to think that badness is good and that it pays			2
i have n't got anything to show for what i did then			0
do n't follow that path			0
' ' sour : my story			0
a troubled girl from a broken home			0
the @entity29 gang she nearly died for			1
the baby she fought to live for ' is out now published by @entity78			0
