a mother - of - two nearly died after developing blood poisoning just days after giving birth to her second child			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , was placed in a coma , her life hanging in the balance as sepsis ravaged her body causing the flesh in her legs to die			1
for 11 days the mother - of two , who had yet to meet her newborn daughter @entity16 , fought the vicious condition			1
when she finally woke , mrs @entity18 was left paralysed after losing muscle function while lying in the medically induced coma			1
today , against the odds , mrs @entity18 has made a full recovery , and is now enjoying looking after her two daughters , @entity25 , five and @entity16 now 18 months			1
@entity7 , 31 , from @entity8 was struck down with life - threatening blood poisoning just days after giving birth to baby @entity16 , now 18 months the blood poisoning surging through her body caused necrosis - where the body 's flesh dies due to lack of oxygen reaching the tissue she was also left paralysed because her muscles wasted away from being in a coma for so long mrs @entity7 said : ' after giving birth to @entity16 i was so excited to be at home , @entity25 was so happy to have a baby sister and it should have been a wonderful time			1
' but within days my health deteriorate rapidly			0
' i felt sick all the time and was so weak - i could n't even hold @entity16 as she felt so heavy in my arms			1
' when i eventually went to hospital my family were told i might not make it through the night , it was that serious			0
' when i came around after my coma i could n't believe what was happening to me - and being paralysed was very scary			1
' but my girls gave me the motivation to keep going and recover quickly , and my husband , @entity52 , was amazing			0
' i 'm so lucky - i was very close to losing my arms and legs - and even my life			0
' i 'm so glad i 'm still here to be a mum for my girls			0
' mrs @entity59 's first daughter , @entity58 , had been a @entity60 , so when she went home she thought being exhausted and weak was usual after a normal birth mrs @entity7 received five different skin graft operations and had physiotherapy to learn to walk again sepsis is a common but potentially life - threatening condition			1
it is triggered by an infection , and causes the body 's immune system to go into overdrive			2
it causes widespread inflammation , swelling and blood clotting			0
it can lead to a significant fall in blood pressure , which can compromise blood flow to vital organs , including the heart , brain and kidneys			0
if not treated quickly , sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death			0
each year in the @entity89 , it is estimated more than 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with sepsis and around 37,000 people die as a result of the condition			0
early symptoms include : in more severe cases a person is likely to suffer : source : @entity100 mrs @entity7 was suffering from sepsis , a life - threatening blood poisoning that kills 37,000 people in the @entity89 each year			1
the poison was forcing her organs to fail and was causing necrosis - the death of body tissue - to her legs			1
doctors put mrs @entity18 into a medically induced coma while they worked to drain her body of the poison that was killing her			1
she was left with scars and parts of her muscles missing because the poison prevented oxygen flowing to the tissue , killing the body 's flesh			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' when i came around from the coma i knew something was wrong but i was n't totally sure			2
' it was a huge shock to realise i could n't move			0
' because i 'd been in a coma for so long i 'd lost all the use of my muscles - i could n't even move my fingers			2
' it was horrible because i still had n't held @entity16 properly , they just had to lie her next to me			2
' i had to have five different skin graft operations on my legs too and then i had to learn to walk again			2
' there was just so much to deal with			0
' mrs @entity7 first became ill the evening after @entity16 was born			1
she said : ' @entity16 was born early in the morning and by the evening i was at home			2
' but i began to feel very weak and tired - not myself at all			0
' @entity25 had been born by c - section , so as i 'd never gone through a natural birth before i was n't sure what to expect , i just thought that the way i was feeling was totally normal			1
mrs @entity7 was in hospital for 11 weeks , and found it difficult to be away from her daughters			1
' i hated being away from them , i was worried all the time and i knew i was missing out on watching them grow up - especially with @entity16 , ' she said @entity146 , five and baby @entity16 , 18 months came to visit their mother in hospital and took her scary appearance ' in their stride ' mrs @entity7 said her girls gave her the motivation to keep going and her husband @entity52 was ' amazing ' ' but as the days wore on i was getting worse and worse			1
' i was constantly thirsty and just totally exhausted - i could barely get out of bed			0
' it was only when , six days later , a nurse came out to me , that she took one look at me and told me to get to the hospital immediately			1
' apparently the infection actually gives off a smell , and the nurse could smell it in my bedroom			0
' i do n't remember much after that , but i know i was in a critical condition			0
' i later found out that the doctors had caught me in what they call the ' golden hour ' - the hour where they need to diagnose and treat me , or it 's too late			2
' i was incredibly lucky			0
' ' my story could have ended so differently , and i know i 'm one of the lucky ones - many people do n't survive ' mrs @entity7 says doctors rushed her into an operating theatre where they worked to drain the body of poison			1
she was then in a coma for 11 days while her body worked to recover			2
mrs @entity7 , said : ' i was brought out of the coma after 11 days , but my journey was far from over			1
' i was given five skin grafts on my legs where they 'd cut away the dying tissue , and i then had to begin intensive physiotherapy to get my muscles working again			1
' it was awful not being able to move - all i wanted to do was cuddle my girls and i could n't			0
' i hated being away from them , i was worried all the time and i knew i was missing out on watching them grow up - especially with @entity16			2
' i finally saw them after three weeks , but even then i was worried they 'd be scared by my appearance			0
' luckily they took it all in their stride and slowly i went from strength to strength			0
' but finally after 11 weeks in hospital i stood up on my own for the very first time , and the doctors agreed that i could go home			1
' i was still unwell but being at home with @entity52 and the girls was the best medicine i could have asked for			0
' now mrs @entity7 has recovered , and is keen to raise awareness of the condition that nearly stole her life			2
she said : ' i still do n't know why i got sepsis , but it can happen to anyone at any time			2
' i just want to make sure people are aware of the symptoms , and to get medical attention immediately			0
' my story could have ended so differently , and i know i 'm one of the lucky ones - many people do n't survive			0
' i ca n't thank the doctors and nurses who treated me enough , they saved my life			2
