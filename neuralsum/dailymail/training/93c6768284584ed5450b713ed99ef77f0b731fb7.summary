by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 13 october 2012 updated : 08:03 est , 14 october 2012 president @entity1 has admitted that giving the green light to the raid that killed @entity4 was ' a flip of the coin ' decision			1
the president revealed he was only 50 per cent confident that the man spotted by the @entity10 living in an @entity12 compound was the world 's most wanted terrorist , according to a new book that weaves together accounts from @entity1 and top decision - makers on the events leading up to the daring operation and it 's aftermath			1
' this is 50 – 50 , ' @entity1 said , silencing the small group of senior officials gathered in the situation room			2
' this is a flip of the coin			0
you guys , i ca n't base this decision on the notion that we have any greater certainty than that			0
' crucial meetings : president @entity1 , pictured left , discussed the raid with his team of security advisers on may 1 2011 published in part in the latest @entity40 , @entity38 's eye - opening book reveals how the head of the @entity10 's bin laden team was only 60 per cent sure the terrorist was living in the @entity45 property			1
@entity46 said the evidence to suggest that @entity48 was hoarding weapons of mass destruction , which later turned out not to be the case , was ' much stronger ' than the intelligence on @entity4 's whereabouts			1
@entity46 had been personally involved in the flawed analysis of @entity48 's weapons capability			1
' i 'm telling you , the case for @entity59 was n't just stronger — it was much stronger , ' he said			2
but @entity1 decided to press ahead			2
nail - biting events : the president sat with vice president @entity62 , and secretary of state @entity63 to watch the mission against @entity4 in the @entity66 ' one of the things you learn as president is you 're always dealing with probabilities , ' he told mr @entity38			1
' no issue comes to my desk that is perfectly solvable			0
no issue comes to my desk where there ’s 100 per cent confidence that this is the right thing to do			0
' because if people were absolutely certain then it would have been decided by someone else			0
' in this situation , what you started getting was probabilities that disguised uncertainty as opposed to actually providing you with more useful information			0
' the only major dissenter to the plan was @entity62 , the book says			0
' mr president , my suggestion is : do n't go , ' the vice president said , believing that a failed attack would scupper any chance of a second term			1
@entity98 : the @entity98 , pictured during a training course , were chosen to conduct the raid on the compound last year ' we have to do two more things to see if he 's there			2
' despite coming to terms with the 50/50 per cent probability that the so - called ' @entity108 ' who teams had been monitoring as he walked around the compound 's grounds , was @entity4 , @entity1 said he could n't help churning the details over in his mind the night before the raid			1
' it was a matter of taking one last breath and just making sure , asking is there something that i have n’t thought of ? ' @entity1 said			0
' is there something that we need to do ? ... at that point my estimation was that we were n't going to be able to do it better a month or two months or three months from now			0
' we were n’t going to have better certainty about whether @entity4 was there , and so it was just a matter of pulling the trigger			0
' the book explains that a courier initially led the @entity10 to the compound where they discovered three families living together in the large property , which was out of place for the area			1
in hiding : this undated image from video seized from the walled compound of @entity145 leader @entity4 in @entity12 , @entity45 the identity of the third family , however , was a mystery			1
the most important clue was the figure who came to be known as @entity108 , a man in traditional @entity45 attire and prayer cap who regularly took walks around the vegetable garden			2
agents took photos and video footage of the man as he paced the grounds			0
they also counted the pieces of laundry that were hung out to dry to determine the size of the hidden family			0
the number of wives and children corresponded with the number of family members they believed might be living with @entity4			2
the @entity10 then got mission commander admiral @entity173 on board , and the elite group of @entity98 did two separate practice runs on @entity178 soil before the nail - biting may 2011 raid , which ended the life of the @entity145 leader .			1

new book reveals @entity1 believed there was a 50/50 chance the man spotted by the @entity10 in @entity45 was @entity4
head of agency 's bin laden team @entity46 said the evidence suggesting @entity48 was hoarding weapons of mass destruction was ' much stronger ' than the intelligence on @entity4 's whereabouts
president said he could n't *sleep* the night before the daring may 2011 raid that killed the terrorist
