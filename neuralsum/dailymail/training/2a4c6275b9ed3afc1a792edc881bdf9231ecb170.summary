by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 6 december 2013 social media campaign : @entity2 , 49 , took to @entity3 to voice her concerns @entity5 up at seeing the local shopping centre boarded up for years after @entity7 ’s failed to deliver its ‘ regeneration ’ plan , @entity2 sprang into action			1
the mother of three took a photograph of the eyesore and posted it on the supermarket chain ’s @entity3 page , asking : ‘ what are you doing ? ’ it was a question baffling the residents of @entity20 – not least because the village is where @entity7 ’s chief executive @entity22 grew up			1
within 48 hours , her photo had been ‘ liked ’ by 500 people			0
so began a campaign by @entity27 which many in the village believe played a crucial role in shaming @entity7 ’s into building the store it had long promised them			2
it was in 2008 that the company spent £ 18million on a large piece of land in @entity20 , near @entity38 , @entity39 , including the 1960s shopping precinct			2
two years later , it tried to get planning permission for a 25,000 sq ft store on the site but failed amid opposition from locals who felt it was too overbearing			1
a smaller proposal was approved the next year			0
but then , having helped traders relocate from the precinct , @entity7 ’s did nothing for over a year before declaring that its proposed supermarket was not commercially viable because of ‘ continuing uncertainty ’ in the economy			0
by the time mrs @entity2 took her photograph in february , there was growing discontent , with some villagers fearing @entity20 had fallen foul of ‘ land - banking ’ – the practice whereby supermarkets buy land to prevent rivals moving in			1
the 49 - year - old set up a @entity3 page , customising the company logo to read ‘ @entity72 ’s ’ , started a @entity69 account @ justinkinghome and launched an online petition			2
eventually , @entity7 ’s moved into action , obtaining permission for a larger store and workmen were seen at the site this week in readiness for demolition of the precinct and the opening of a supermarket for christmas 2014			1
boarded up : the precinct in @entity20 was bought with the rest of the land by @entity7 's for £ 18m in 2008 yesterday mrs @entity2 , a leadership coach , said : ‘ i ’ve never protested like this before but i was fed up at looking at a boarded - up site			1
‘ the supermarket plan was very divisive in the village from the start , but my own position was fairly neutral towards it			0
where i became very angry , and active , was that having got planning permission , i felt @entity7 ’s should build			0
‘ the promise was regeneration			2
there was a sense of betrayal when @entity7 ’s did nothing with the site for so long			0
’ @entity102 , chairman of @entity103 ’ @entity101 , said : ‘ we asked @entity7 ’s what was going on and got fobbed off			0
‘ one wonders what would have happened if @entity2 had not embarrassed the ceo			1
’ @entity7 ’s denied land - banking and blamed planning laws for the long delay .			0

mother of three @entity2 launched social media campaign in home town of the chain 's ceo @entity22 after failed regeneration promise
supermarket chain bought the *derelict* site but failed to *renovate* it in 2008
mrs @entity2 's comment *sparked* *reaction* and store now set to open in 2014
