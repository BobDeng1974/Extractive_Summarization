marriage is as important to the future of the nation as climate change and poverty , a senior family lawyer said yesterday			2
@entity6 said the growing numbers of families without fathers was doing more harm to the next generation than other factors such as smoking , alcohol , poor diet and lack of exercise			1
and she warned that a conspiracy of silence surrounded the issue because political leaders were afraid to say married families were better for children than cohabiting families or single parent families			1
' @entity26 ' : politicians are now too afraid to offend single parent families , says @entity29 @entity29 , who is head of the @entity30 , made her remarks at a conference organised by the @entity33 , a pressure group led by @entity35 family judge sir @entity34			1
she said marriage was based on a public promise and evidence showed married parents were twice as likely to stay together through a child ’s early years as cohabiting parents			1
children of single mothers have greater problems than those of cohabitee parents , and children of cohabitees have greater problems than those of married parents			1
‘ since this is so incontrovertible , why is it so brave , as sir @entity53 would put it , to tackle the desirability of marriage over cohabitation , both for adults and children ? ’ @entity29 asked			2
‘ the topic has become a no - go area			0
‘ we live in a world where we are encouraged to take care of our own and our children ’s health : we are constantly admonished to take exercise , eat healthily , wear a cycle helmet , study the side of the package , stop smoking , recycle , combat global warming , brush our teeth , control our drinking habits and have health checks			0
but when it comes to the one issue that does more harm to the next generation than any of these – the absence of a father in the family – there is a conspiracy of silence			2
championing marriage : baroness @entity6 says children of single mothers and cohabitees have greater problems than those of married parents ‘ politicians fear to address it			1
it is time to place marriage issues up there along with climate change , poverty and peace as a topic pre-eminently relevant to the present and future happiness and health of all people			0
’ @entity29 said those who favoured cohabitation often said marriage was ‘ only a piece of paper ’ , adding : ‘ it is clearly a very important piece of paper , nonetheless , of the utmost significance to life , equal love and happiness , say the gay community , when gay marriage is on the agenda			0
’ other kinds of relationship are seen as lesser than marriage , she added			0
‘ children deserve natural parents who are prepared to make the act of commitment and aspiration found only in marriage , in order to demonstrate to those children that they intend to be there for them , without question , as they grow up			2
‘ the wedding ceremony highlights the fact that marriage is the strongest bond ever invented to link together two people and two families , for now and posterity – intimately , legally , politically , religiously , civilly and publicly			0
’ @entity29 added that same - sex couples who have entered civil partnerships are pressing to have marriage , which is seen as a ‘ better alternative ’ .			0

*supporting* marriage has become a ' no go area ' for our politicians says @entity6
she says an absence of fathers is ' harming ' the next generation of children
politicians are ' too afraid ' of offending cohabiting partners or single parents
