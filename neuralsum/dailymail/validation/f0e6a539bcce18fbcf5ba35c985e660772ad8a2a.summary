@entity0 , 62 , had cancelled several planned meetings during the week leading to speculation over his health and even claims that he was fighting to retain his position			2
@entity16 showed footage of @entity0 meeting with supreme court president @entity18 , which it claims was shot on friday			1
@entity0 is due to meet with the president of @entity33 in @entity34 on monday according to the @entity35			1
the @entity31 president was last seen in public on march 5			1
for the past week , the @entity31 government has been reluctantly answering questions about @entity0 's health and suggestions that his unofficial girlfriend @entity42 had checked into a @entity44 maternity clinic			1
rumours about 31 - year - old @entity42 surfaced with reports in @entity44 , @entity47 and @entity31 suggesting the gymnast had either given birth or was about to do so			1

@entity42 has been largely out of sight since quitting as an mp in @entity0 's @entity85 last september , when she took over as head of a major media conglomerate			1
meanwhile , the @entity35 today issued a new picture showing @entity0 meeting the chairman of the @entity90 @entity18 at his out - of - @entity92 residence @entity93			1
the image was meant to scotch suggestions that @entity0 was not at work amid speculation over a coup or illness			0
however , there were immediate claims the picture and tv footage was old , and that it was further evidence of his mystery absence			0
current rumours in @entity92 include @entity0 suffering a stroke , or an unfolding palace coup , following his sudden cancellation of a scheduled trip to @entity112			2
with @entity92 in febrile mood , a former senior aide to the strongman claimed another @entity117 spy is being urgently lined up to take over from him			0
the theory suggests the @entity35 's chief of staff @entity119 - a former defence minister - will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre @entity123			1

and @entity123 , who served as president for four years to 2012 , is also out of the limelight			0
some kremlin - watchers say that @entity173 sanctions have created huge tensions inside @entity0 's fractious entourage in recent weeks , with cash streams closed off			2
the murder of opposition leader @entity178 - branded a ' provocation ' by @entity0 - has only intensified the infighting with blame for his slaying blamed on the president 's close allies in @entity185			0
@entity142 , a senior follow at the @entity187 in @entity188 , earlier alleged a cover - up by the @entity31 authorities over @entity178 's shooting yards from the @entity35			2

the former gymnast is rumoured to be the president 's girlfriend the @entity35 insists he is healthy , but this has done nothing to end speculation from @entity31 who for years were lied to over the health of geriatric @entity206 leaders , and also @entity0 's predecessor @entity207			1
' @entity209 's assertion that @entity0 is in good health , however , could also mean recent developments in @entity31 politics required @entity0 's presence in @entity92 , ' stated the @entity214 today			1
' a heightening of the conflict in eastern @entity144 and the murder of opposition politician @entity178 , the investigation into whose death was reportedly accompanied by signs of an increased power struggle within the @entity31 administration , could have kept @entity0 busy behind closed doors			0
' in december , @entity0 brushed aside claims he could be overthrown			0
' i can assure you that we do n't have palaces , so a palace coup is n't really possible			0
the official presidential residence is the @entity35			0
