eligible : the number of claimants has soared to 3.2million , with 135,000 receiving the allowance for back pain tens of thousands of people have been awarded disability benefits for back pain			1
others are claiming the cash for problems such as drug or alcohol abuse and asthma			1
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) is supposed to help those who have difficulty walking or washing and dressing			2
but new figures released under freedom of information laws have revealed the benefit was paid to claimants with a surprising range of conditions			0
last year the mobility component of the benefit , worth up to £ 55.25 a week , was handed out to 140,000 people suffering from back pain			1
there were 18,000 awards for alcohol and drug abuse , 25,000 for asthma and 1,500 for ‘ frailty ’			1
the care component of the benefit , which is worth up to £ 79.15 a week , was paid to 135,000 people with back pain			1
there were 21,000 awards last year for asthma , 19,000 for alcohol or drug abuse and nearly 1,000 for people suffering from ‘ multiple allergy syndrome ’			1
the number of claimants has already spiralled to 3.2million			0
and the amount of people claiming @entity14 is set to rise to 3.5million by 2015 – more than three times the 1.1million who received the benefit when it was created in 1992			1
this costs taxpayers £ 13.2billion a year , around the same amount as the entire budget of the @entity54			1
the government ’s plan to replace @entity14 with a new @entity57 has prompted angry complaints from medical charities and disability groups			2
but ministers say that , without reform , one in 17 people will be claiming the benefit by 2018			1
the latest in a series of radical changes to the welfare system will come into effect today			2
most benefit payments are due to be increased by just 1 per cent – a figure below inflation – while @entity14 will begin to be replaced by @entity57			1
official figures suggest 71 per cent of those currently being paid @entity14 get the benefit ‘ without systematic checks ’			2
often they are simply asked to hand in a form assessing their capability which they have filled out themselves			0
now most claimants will be told to attend a compulsory face - to - face assessment			0
like the @entity14 , @entity57 will be non-means tested , non-taxable and is paid to people whether they are in or out of work			2
initially , it will only apply to new claimants but existing ones will gradually be reassessed			0
paralympian and disability rights campaigner @entity89 has insisted the changes will hit vulnerable people			0
differing opinions : paralympian @entity89 ( right ) said @entity14 is a lifeline for people with a wide range of conditions who need support			2
@entity101 , ( left ) minister for disabled people said the new benefit system will make sure the support is given to those who need it most reforms : official figures suggest 71 per cent of those currently being paid @entity14 get the benefit ' without systematic checks '			1
a stricter system will crack down on people claiming for conditions including asthma and @entity115 , @entity117 @entity116 chief executive , said : ‘ our members tell us they face an incomprehensible maze of benefits changes – the bedroom tax , housing benefit changes , changes to social care eligibility , and the introduction of @entity57			1
‘ social security is a springboard to participation			0
it is an investment in disabled people ’s contribution to society			0
‘ benefits provide a bit of support , like an adapted car or a travelling companion for someone with a learning disability			0
‘ they can make the difference between the person living for decades isolated and out of work or making a full contribution to society			0
’ but disability minister @entity101 insisted : ‘ the @entity57 has been designed to better reflect today ’s understanding of disability , particularly to update our thinking on mental health and fluctuating conditions			0
‘ we are introducing a new face - to - face assessment and regular reviews – something missing in the current system			0
‘ this will ensure the billions we spend on the benefit give more targeted support to those who need it most			0

3.2 million people claiming @entity14 cost the taxpayer £ 13.2billion
drug and alcohol abuse and asthma are listed as reasons for claiming the benefit
135,000 people who suffer from back pain are given £ *80* a week to pay for personal care
stricter system that assesses claimant *'s* need comes into effect *tomorrow*
