@entity0 set his sights on a century of @entity3 tries and the all - time scoring record after striking twice at @entity5 to condemn @entity6 to a 20th successive league defeat			1
the 29 - year - old wing took his personal try tally in the competition to 79 — seven behind @entity11 — as @entity12 surged into fifth in the table with this bonus - point victory			1
having touched down once in each half , @entity0 revealed his ambition to finish his career ahead of his wing rival from @entity20			1
‘ i ’m chasing him , but i ’ve still got a long way to go , ’ he said			2
‘ of course that ’s a target of mine but i ’m not going to set a time - frame for it			2
i just have to focus on playing well for my team , but there is always that carrot that i want to finish as top try - scorer			2
@entity12 's prolific @entity0 crosses for his second try against @entity6 a general view of a line out during the @entity3 match between @entity12 and @entity6 @entity12 ' @entity35 claims the ball from a line out during the @entity3 match at @entity5 @entity12 : @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 , 66 ) , @entity0 ; @entity44 ( @entity45 , 54 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 , 57 ) ; @entity48 ( @entity49 , 60 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 , 57 ) , @entity53 - @entity52 ( @entity54 , 56 ) ; @entity35 , @entity55 ( @entity56 , 66 ) ; @entity58 , @entity57 ( @entity59 , 64 ) sin bin : @entity43 , 73 @entity6 : @entity61 ; @entity63 ( @entity62 , 53 ) , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ; @entity67 ( @entity68 , 56 ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 , 59 ) ; @entity72 ( @entity71 , 34 ) , @entity73 ( @entity74 , 59 ) , @entity75 ( @entity76 , 59 ) ; @entity77 , @entity78 ( @entity79 , 51 ) ; @entity80 ( @entity81 , 51 ) , @entity82 ‘ that would be nice			1
i ’m not sure how long i would keep it for , because there are a lot of young wingers coming through , but chasing @entity11 is definitely one of my targets			0
’ @entity0 admitted being left out of the @entity12 side for the first game of the season — following the signing of @entity94 from @entity95 — had served as a ‘ kick up the a * * e ’ which has led to a run of three tries in three matches			1
he has his eye on the three - figure landmark , adding : ‘ 100 tries in your career in the @entity3 would be awesome			1
’ @entity105 are n’t exactly awash with prolific try - scoring candidates to play on the wing ahead of next year ’s @entity108 , but @entity0 has n’t played for his country since 2008			1
he retains faint hope , saying : ‘ it ’s in my head , but i ca n’t go out thinking about that			0
i ’m 29 , i ’m not ancient			0
i ’ve got to carry on playing the best i can and hopefully @entity114 ( @entity115 ) will see what i can offer			0
’ this was not an emphatic triumph by @entity12 , but it was a good return given that director of rugby , @entity120 , had rotated his squad , with @entity105 lock @entity122 resting in the stand			1
their victory was founded on a superb showing by @entity127 flanker @entity58 , who carried strongly , handled with sublime class and set up two tries , as well as tackling with gusto and competing fiercely at the breakdown			0
‘ i thought he was a deserving man of the match , ’ said @entity120			0
‘ he has been outstanding for us all season — he ’s a real talisman and he comes up with some big plays			0
’ however , @entity120 ’s opposite number , @entity138 , was not convinced by one of those plays — the pass to send @entity0 away for his second try			2
it looked marginally forward , but was not reviewed by the referee — another @entity138 — and that incensed the man in charge of @entity6 , who suggested his struggling team had been harshly treated			2
@entity41 of @entity12 looks on during the @entity3 match between @entity12 and @entity6 @entity6 ' @entity66 ( right ) is tackled by @entity12 ' @entity50 at @entity5 on sunday @entity12 ' @entity150 claims the ball from a lineout during the @entity3 match at @entity5 ‘ @entity0 scored a try off a pass by @entity58 which was only two yards forward , ’ he quipped			1
‘ i do n’t know why the ref did n’t come back for that and it really affected the morale of our guys			0
you do n’t get anything when you are down at the bottom and the refs do n’t even listen			0
our physios and water - boys told the ref that was a forward pass and he did n’t even listen			0
’ remarkably , @entity170 claimed the @entity6 ’ sequence of league defeats , which is nearing a full calendar year in duration is ‘ not much of a concern to the guys at all ’			1
it should be , as the @entity179 club are destined for another season of grim struggle against the spectre of relegation			0
at least the visitors scored two tries — the first a twisting effort from scrum half @entity69 and the second a penalty try at the death when @entity43 was sin - binned for what was deemed a deliberate knock - on near his own line			2
they could have had another , but @entity71 knocked on over the line in the second half			0
yet , the outcome was not really in doubt from the 20th minute , when @entity41 ’s sharp offload teed up @entity0 ’s first try			2
@entity44 ’s kicking kept the hosts in front and @entity35 galloped over before the break			1
@entity58 set up @entity0 for another left - corner strike and @entity39 burst away for @entity12 ’ bonus - point try from @entity43 ’s pass in the closing stages			1
@entity120 had mixed feelings , saying : ‘ parts of our game were very good and parts of our game were messy , ’ but his side are heading in the right direction .			0

wasps comfortably see off @entity6 at @entity5 to jump up five spots
@entity12 scored four tries through @entity0 ( two ) , @entity39 and @entity35 with @entity44 kicking three penalties and two **conversion*s*
@entity39 also added a *conversion* as @entity6 failed to get to grips
@entity6 's miserable run of @entity3 defeats was extended to 20
