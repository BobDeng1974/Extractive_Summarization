and to those who did n't have a voice , you do now			0

there is said to be a file of ' damaging material ' about @entity6 's sessions with auditors at the church that will stop him from dissenting			1
others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of @entity69 's @entity68 in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church , it was claimed			1
the claims have been disputed by the @entity41 who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as ' admitted ' liars and perjurers and ' professional anti-scientologists			1
' directed by @entity80 , going @entity14 aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including film stars @entity6 and @entity85			1
it included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated			2
these included descriptions of a ' prison camp ' , revealed by former member @entity97			0
people put into this camp are forced to do around 30 hours of hard labour , broken up by three hour rest breaks			1
@entity102 was once the point of contact between the @entity41 and @entity6 and said she was sent to this ' prison camp ' , known as the @entity107 which , she claims , is where members are ' reindoctrinated			1
' the documentary also claimed @entity1 chiefs hold a ' black pr package ' on @entity6 , with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions			1

as well as beatings in ' @entity151 ' , they are allegedly also subjected to demeaning tasks including mopping up the floor with their tongue to force t them to confess their crimes against the @entity41			1
others are apparently ordered to play musical chairs to the sound of @entity69 's @entity68 - fighting each other for chairs which allow them to remain in the church , with losers being expelled			1

former senior executive @entity208 was also interviewed for the documentary and made claims about the church 's tax requirements			2
@entity208 was a senior aide to the current leader of the @entity41 , and alleged the church 's goal was to be recognised by the @entity216 ( @entity216 ) in order to be made a fully tax - exempt religion , which it achieved in 1993			2
members are said to have filed dozens of lawsuits against @entity216 and employed private investigators to dig for information in a bid to get the church recognized			2
@entity226 - once a member of the @entity41 and the point of contact with @entity6 - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30 - hour shifts , with around three hours of breaks another senior former member interviewed was @entity51 , a former director of the church			1
he said once members reached a certain level they would see founder @entity238 's handwritten account of the creation myth			0
this states that @entity241 , a galactic dictator froze people and dropped their bodies into volcanoes , 75 million years ago			0
these spirits are said to have jumped into the bodies of newborns and are now used as the explanation for the source of all of our anxieties and fears			0
@entity238 is also said to have created ' ethics ' - a series of punishments for auditors who made mistakes			0
mr @entity51 left the church citing problems with its stance on gay rights , after his two gay daughters told him how they were being treated by members			0
the @entity266 winning filmmaker wrote an infamous resignation to @entity268 , @entity1 's chairman and @entity238 's successor , saying he was disappointed that he had failed to denounce actions of a @entity272 church against gay people			1
the documentary , based on a book by journalist @entity276 , also claims that when the church thought @entity85 was ‘ slipping away ’ during his marriage to @entity187 , it worked with him to wiretap her phone , a claim that is flatly denied			2
in an interview with @entity282 said he took great steps to ensure that those who spoke out were not put into a compromising position and he ensured he never filmed them at their homes or arrived at a meeting point at the same time			0
he added : ' i often used throw - away phones and encrypted e-mail			0
' the @entity41 , which is believed to have around 50,000 members , denied the allegations featured in going @entity14 and said the statements included were ' entirely false			1
' @entity80 ( left ) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members and @entity51 ( right ) the documentary was screened in @entity300 on sunday evening and is based on @entity276 's book in a statement it said : ' the church has documented evidence that those featured in @entity80 's film regurgitating their stale , discredited allegations are admitted perjurers , admitted liars and professional anti-scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims			1
all have been gone so long from the @entity41 they know nothing of it today			0
' yet @entity80 and @entity16 stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the @entity41 to offer relevant information about them , with more than 25 individuals with first - hand information eager to speak			0
to this day , neither @entity16 nor @entity80 can deny that they have yet to present the @entity41 with a single allegation from the film so the @entity41 may have an opportunity to respond			0
the @entity41 never sought special treatment , only fair treatment			0
' since going @entity14 premiered at the @entity328 in january , the church has created a website dedicated to criticising the film and released its own version , called ' get the truth			2
' representatives also branded the documentary a ' bigoted propaganda piece			0

but you know , my religion 's fair game , i guess , " cause it 's new "			0
