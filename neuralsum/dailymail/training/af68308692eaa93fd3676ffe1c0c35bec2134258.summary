by @entity0 published : 20:42 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 03:11 est , 14 february 2013 @entity1 has released an astonishing image of what they believe is the youngest black hole in the @entity6 galaxy and , in space terms at least , it 's just around the corner			1
information from the agency 's @entity10 , a telescope that observes the cosmos from an orbit 139,000 kilometres above the @entity15 , suggests that the supernova remnant 's oddly - shaped clouds of glowing gas may contain a young black hole			1
the remnant , called @entity21 , is about 1,000 years old			1
that is equivalent to a blink of an eye in a universe believed to be nearly 14 billion years old			1
our own sun has clocked up 4.5billion years			1
music of the spheres : a highly distorted supernova remnant that , according to @entity1 , may contain the most recent black hole formed in the @entity6 galaxy			1
the remnant , called @entity21 , is about a thousand years old , as seen from @entity15 , and is at a distance of about 26,000 light years away a black hole is a region of space - time where gravity prevents anything , including light , from escaping			1
it is called ' black ' because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon , reflecting nothing , just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics			1
black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle			2
after a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings			2
it 's also just 26,000 light years away and was created in a very rare way , reports the @entity59			1
' it appears its parent star ended its life in a way that most others do n’t , ' said @entity65 , who led the study at the @entity67			0
@entity1 said the supernova explosion that occurred when this star ran out of fuel was ' peculiar '			2
the star exploded with ' jets shooting away from the star ’s poles ' — making the supernova elongated and elliptical			0
usually , the explosions tend to be symmetrical			0
supernova explosions occur when massive stars run out of fuel , but @entity1 notes such blasts are not well understood			0
another surprising element is that there was no neutron star			0
normally , the collapse of some massive stars leaves a dense , spinning core , but not this one			0
@entity86 , press officer at @entity1 ’s @entity10 , said it ’s that lack of evidence that points to the existence of a black hole			0
' in this case … the lack of pulsations from the other possible explanation ( a rapidly rotating dense star called a neutron star ) add to the evidence that a black hole is there , ' @entity86 said			0
' in other situations , however , astronomers can detect the black hole ’s presence by its influence on the material around it			2
' the possible black hole and the reason behind it remain something of a mystery			0
as @entity112 says in a blog post , these ' exotic explosions can happen within our own galaxy , and further study … will give great insights into how these awesome events come about '			2
@entity1 launched the @entity10 in 1999			0
the findings about @entity21 will be published in an upcoming issue of the @entity121 .			1

@entity21 is just 1,000 years old , a split second in a universe that is *estimated* to be 14 billion years old
it is only 26,000 light years away - just around the corner when *compared* with other *objects* in our galaxy
the explosion that formed it is *unusually* shaped , *intriguing* astronomers
