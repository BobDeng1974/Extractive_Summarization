by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 19:47 est , 17 march 2014 @entity2 must be wary of @entity4 's @entity3 on tuesday evening			1
here , @entity5 runs the rule over the @entity8 giants and identifies three key men who can dent the @entity11 ' hopes of progressing to the quarter - finals			0
the old friend @entity14 will make an emotional return to @entity16 on tuesday but could still do his old employers some damage			2
he had a quiet night in the first leg in @entity20 where @entity21 marshalled him well , but he has scored twice for @entity3 since that meeting and will want to add to his tally on a ground where he found the net 89 times for @entity2			2
returning hero : @entity14 will be back at @entity16 and is certain to get a warm reception no love lost : @entity14 says it will be difficult to play against @entity2 but will do his utmost to win the game history boy : @entity14 was instrumental in @entity2 's @entity35 win over @entity36 in 2012 1 - 1 after the first leg kick - off : 7.45pm , @entity16 @entity39 : live on @entity40 from 7.30pm and @entity41 and @entity42 referee : @entity44 ( @entity45 ) @entity46 : @entity14 to score — 10 - 3 the one @entity47 got away @entity48 was linked with a move to @entity2 last summer but the @entity50 opted to go to @entity8 instead where he is now one of @entity3 ’s most creative players			1
in the first leg his corner led to his team ’s equaliser and he created more chances than any other player on the pitch			0
he also knows what it takes to win at @entity16 — in his only appearance at the ground he helped @entity63 to a 1 - 0 win in 2010			0
his manager that night ? @entity66			0
the and now : @entity48 was a key player in @entity66 's treble - winning @entity63 side maestro : @entity48 's eye for a pass makes him a dangerous opponent in front of the @entity11 ' defence three to fear : @entity14 ( right ) , @entity48 and @entity75 pose for the cameras earlier this season tribute : @entity75 named his son after @entity79 , to the surprise of the former @entity82 star the @entity79 fan @entity75 might play in midfield but he always has one eye up front , so much so he named his son after @entity79			1
@entity75 explained in 2010 : ‘ i gave that name [ @entity88 ] to my son because i find it very beautiful			2
’ though flattered , @entity79 said : ‘ surely with the array of talent within the @entity94 team , he could have named him after someone other than a goal hanger like me ! ’ @entity75 has only scored twice all season , but he made more passes in the @entity2 half than any other player in the first leg			1
@entity2 ’s @entity104 if he plays tonight , @entity105 will be making his 100th appearance in the @entity35 , with 88 of those coming for @entity2 and the other 12 for @entity108			1
@entity3 will do well to get past the @entity110 goalkeeper — he has conceded just 10 goals at @entity16 this season and only one at home in 2014			2
interesting method : @entity105 could make his 100th appearance in the @entity35 on tuesday curious : @entity105 was put through his paces using a tennis racquet and tennis balls at @entity121 veteran : @entity105 concedes a penalty from then @entity125 playmaker @entity124 back in 2005 @entity3 are in good form having lost just one of their last 23 matches			1
but they have only won four out of 19 away games all season			0
the @entity8 also have a miserable record in @entity82			0
in eight matches they have won just once , drawing three and losing five .			0

@entity14 , @entity48 and @entity75 ones to watch
but @entity3 have poor away record this season under @entity4
@entity105 in line for 100th @entity35 appearance
