two women who say they were sexually abused as teenagers by financial guru and former @entity4 confidante @entity3 in his @entity6 mansion are hoping a trove of newly released documents will get the case reopened			1
@entity3 was suspected nearly a decade ago of paying for sex with dozens of underage girls			0
the @entity12 ultimately dropped its investigation , and @entity3 pleaded guilty to a single offense and served more than a year in jail			2
cutting a deal : @entity3 , seen here in 2008 , pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution but a host of other accusers had their cases dropped recently , though , @entity3 's accusers won a precedent - setting ruling that will let them see the documents regarding the deal @entity3 made with the government			1
the women say they were left in the dark about the agreement , only learning about it after @entity3 pleaded guilty to the single solicitation charge			0
the women are hoping to undo the agreement and subject @entity3 to more charges			0
the women 's lawyers say @entity3 got a sweetheart deal because of his wealth and connections			0
among those connections were his ties to then - president @entity4 who flew on @entity3 's private jet more than 10 times			1
flight logs from 2002 to 2005 that were only disclosed in march show that @entity4 , who was only recently out of the @entity48 at that point , travelled around the world courtesy of @entity3 while his wife , @entity52 , was a senator in @entity53			1
after jail : former president @entity4 cut ties to @entity3 after the prostitution scandal ( @entity3 at left in 2011 ) staying close : prince @entity59 visited @entity3 in @entity53 in 2011 ( pictured ) just shortly after he was released from jail for the prostitution charge among the stops were @entity3 ’s @entity64 island , @entity65 , where young girls were supposedly kept as sex slaves			1
@entity4 was deemed to be so close to @entity3 he was nearly forced to give a statement during the investigation into the latter ’s paedophilic tendencies , legal documents revealed in march			0
@entity3 , who is now 61 , is considered to be one of the most well - connected men in @entity75 caused acute embarrassment to prince @entity59 , who was at one point photographed with @entity78 , one of the girls @entity3 is said to have used as a sex slave			2
the @entity59 also stayed at @entity3 ’s home in @entity82 and flew with him in his private jet			2
mansion : the teenage girls accused @entity3 of sexually abusing them in his @entity6 mansion ( pictured ) the investigation into @entity3 's exploits came when a woman in @entity6 contacted police saying that her 14 - year - old daughter had been paid $ 300 to massage him and then have sex			2
the claim prompted a nearly year - long investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting prostitution which came as part of a plea deal			0
he spent 13 months of a 18 - month sentence in jail and remains a registered sex offender			0
several of his famous friends cut ties - including @entity4 and then - @entity53 governor @entity108 who returned his campaign donations - but not all of them : prince @entity59 reportedly stayed at @entity3 's mansion in @entity53 in 2010 , months after he was released from jail .			1

@entity3 served time after *pleasing* guilty to one count of soliciting a prostitute but accusations from teen girls of sex abuse were dropped
those alleged *victims* are now able to access the plea deal and are hoping to bring up further charges against the financial guru
he was very close with former president @entity4 and prince @entity59
flight logs that were released this spring show that @entity4 flew on @entity3 's private jet more than 10 times between 2002 and 2005
