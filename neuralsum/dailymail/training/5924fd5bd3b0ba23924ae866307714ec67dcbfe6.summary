by @entity0 an unlucky sword used by the losers of the battles of @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 over a period of 250 years is expected to reach £ 120,000 at auction			1
it is believed that the 11th century broadsword was originally carried to @entity12 by @entity14 raiders when it was captured , only to be lost a few weeks later at the @entity5 in 1066			1
in 1314 , the sword was carried to @entity16 at the @entity6 , where the owner was forced to retreat having witnessed his nephew axed to death			1
the sword , pictured , was on the losing side of four of the major battles which shaped @entity24 history however , the cursed sword 's bad luck continued at the @entity27 in 1322 , when the unfortunate owner was speared in the anus and killed			1
now , the weapon is going to be auctioned by @entity32 's auction house in @entity33			0
the 27 - inch 11th century @entity14 blade features an iron cross-guard			0
the sword has the coat of arms of sir @entity38 , whose nephew @entity39 was killed @entity6 by @entity40			1
according to @entity32 's the sword was captured three weeks before the @entity5 after @entity42 , the last @entity44 king of @entity24 defeated the @entity46 raider @entity47 at the @entity4 in @entity48			1
the sword features the crest of the @entity52 family who captured it at the @entity5 in 1066 the doomed sword was used at @entity5 where @entity42 was defeated by @entity55			1
experts believe that the sword was picked up from the battlefield by @entity38 , who was the victorious king 's god father			0
the blade was remounted with the @entity62 coat of arms , where sir @entity38 , 4th @entity63 and @entity64 carried it north to @entity16			0
he was killed eight years later at the @entity27 where a patient pikeman speared him in the anus			1
@entity32 ’s spokeswoman @entity68 said today : ' whilst it can not be proved , it is not at all inconceivable that the blade of the present sword was captured or taken as a trophy by @entity38 at @entity5 and was later remounted to become a family sword			1
' the present sword , whilst not being a war sword , would have served as a clear badge of identity with its gold and enamelled coat of arms on the pommel and eminently more practical as a side arm around camp when not mounted and armed for battle			2
it is therefore entirely possible that this sword was present at @entity6 in june 1314 if not actually on the field of battle			1
' @entity88 went to meet with a particularly gruesome end at the battle of @entity7 in @entity48 in march 1322			2
' for the last 50 years , the sword has been in the hands of two private collectors , firstly with the @entity95 - based @entity94 , and latterly with the present , anonymous , vendor			2
' sir @entity88 's unfortunate demise was later celebrated by the children 's tv show @entity98			0
the @entity14 sword arrived in september 1066 , where it was captured at the @entity4 in september 1066 @entity104 of @entity46 landed in @entity48 , with @entity105 , the brother of the reigning @entity24 monarch @entity42			1
@entity42 marched north to challenge the @entity107 who had already captured @entity109 and were threatening his throne			0
after freeing @entity109 , @entity42 confronted the @entity14 invaders at @entity4 where the sword was picked up from the battle field by forces loyal to the @entity24 king , who returned south to face the threat posed by the @entity118 one of @entity42 's men carried the sword south where it was again on the losing side at @entity5 just three weeks after the @entity4 , @entity42 was again facing a major challenge to his throne			1
this time , @entity55 , who had been promised the @entity24 throne by @entity124 landed on the @entity125			0
@entity55 delayed his invasion until after @entity42 fought the @entity107 at @entity4 so his adversary 's forces would be weakened			2
the battle took place on october 14 , 1066 when @entity55 's cavalry charged the defending @entity24 troops			2
historians believe the @entity24 defenders had an effective shield wall and were able to repel the initial charges until @entity42 was killed in battle , reputedly by an arrow in the eye			0
sir @entity38 witnessed his nephew killed by @entity40 before fleeing with the sword the two - day battle between june 23 - 24 1314 is one of the major points in @entity16 history			2
outnumbered by three - to - one , the @entity16 army under @entity40 , routed the forces of @entity148 among those at the battle was sir @entity38 , who was carrying the sword , his ancestor @entity149 had picked up from the battle field in @entity5 200 years earlier			1
he witnessed his nephew @entity154 charge @entity40 across the battlefield where the @entity16 king struck the @entity24 knight in the head			0
sir @entity88 fled the scene and was captured - along with his sword			2
sir @entity149 was killed at @entity7 eight years after escaping with his life at @entity6 , sir @entity149 was marching against troops loyal to @entity148 sir @entity88 tried to charge forces guarding a wooden bridge in @entity7 in @entity48 , with his unlucky sword			1
as he reached the bridge , a man using a pike , stabbed sir @entity88 from below , reportedly ramming the weapon through his anus			0
sir @entity88 was fighting for the @entity172 , who was contesting the @entity24 throne			0
following his defeat , the @entity172 was captured and later executed for treason			0
historians believe that @entity148 's men had learned several of the tactics deployed by the @entity16 at @entity6 to defeat his rivals			2
a @entity32 ’s expert said : ' the whereabouts of the sword prior to @entity185 ’s ownership is not known , but the mention of a family sword bearing the @entity189 arms in sir @entity88 ’s will and the use of a mid- 11th century @entity14 blade makes for an interesting train of thought potentially linking significant events of @entity12 history from the @entity107 , @entity5 and @entity6 through this object			1
' a series of x-rays which accompany the sword support the age of the items and show no modern repairs			0
” the sword blade is described as ' an extremely rare late medieval broadsword , with earlier @entity14 blade , and bearing the arms of the @entity52 family '			0
a memorial for the @entity27 , @entity48 , where the unlucky sword lost yet another owner @entity211 , @entity212 , said : ' we are delighted to be offering this extremely rare sword during the year in which the @entity6 celebrates its 700th birthday			1
' we imagine that the sword will be of broad interest to collectors of historical artefacts or arms and armours as well as to museums and institutions			0
' the sword will be on display for a month at our @entity228 saleroom which will allow it the publicity and exposure it deserves			0
' the sword , pictured , is expected to sell for between £ 80,000 and £ 120,000 later this summer in @entity33			0

the sword was first lost by @entity46 raiders at @entity4 in 1066
three weeks later , it was captured by the @entity118 at the @entity5
it was carried to @entity6 in 1322 where its owner *narrowly* escaped
eight years later his luck ran out when he was speared in the anus in battle
