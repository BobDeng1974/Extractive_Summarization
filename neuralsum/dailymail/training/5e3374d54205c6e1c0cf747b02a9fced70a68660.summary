it was a big game for us , right			2
i just was n't happy with some of the decisions			1
he just showed me the way off			2
no hard feelings or whatever			0
maybe i overreacted in that situation when he stopped the game when the ball hit @entity36 in the stomach and we were in a good position , two against one			0
‘ but nothing serious happened in that moment or after the game			0
i 'm not used to this kind of situation			0
‘ i had 60 or 70 games with @entity45 , but i think this is the second time i 've been asked out of the dug - out			1
‘ i do n't know the rules , but i see no reason for me not to be in the dug - out in @entity50 , really			1
if that was a reason , many coaches would be missing from the dug - out			2

‘ we are big time alive , though			0
we 're going to their soil , their stadium , in front of their spectators , but we did n't concede			0
‘ we played without our most important player ( @entity88 ) @entity87 , who is very likely to be fit for the second leg			2
