rock inscriptions and tomb carvings have shed light on the large beasts that thrived in @entity4 before they were wiped out around 6,000 years ago			1
the etchings depict horned hartebeest and oryx , as well as other big mammals , that lived in the @entity10 before its ecology changed dramatically , and the country became drier overall			1
experts claim that 37 large bodied mammals including lions , wild dogs , elephants and giraffes , lived in @entity4 before the time of the pharaohs which began in 3,100 bc - compared to just eight now			1
scientists studied depictions of animals in @entity4 artefacts to assemble a detailed record of the animals present in the @entity10 going back to pre-dynastic times			1
this 5,150 year - old ceremonial stone palette is ramed by two wild dogs clasping one another ’s paws and features ostrich , hartebeest , oryx and giraffes scientists have used depictions of animals in @entity4 artefacts to assemble a detailed record of the animals present in the @entity10 going back to pre-dynastic times			1
the study shows species extinctions in the area - probably caused by a drying climate and an exploding human population - made the ecosystem progressively less stable			2
one of the artefacts examined was a 5,150 year - old ceremonial stone palette housed in a museum at @entity48			0
it is framed by two wild dogs clasping one another ’s paws and features ostrich , hartebeest , wildebeest , ibex , oryx and giraffes			0
the palette also features mythical creatures including serpent - necked panthers and what is thought to be a griffin - a legendary bird with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle			0
the etchings depict horned hartebeest ( pictured left in the @entity73 desert ) and oryx ( pictured right ) as well as other cumbersome animals that lived in the @entity10 before its ecology changed dramatically and the country became drier experts say that 37 large bodied mammals also including lions , wild dogs , elephants and giraffes lived in @entity4 before the time of the pharaohs which began in 3,100 bc - compared to just eight now			1
computational analysis identified five episodes when dramatic changes occurred in @entity4 ’s mammals , three of which coincided with extreme environmental changes as the climate shifted to more arid conditions			1
these droughts also coincided with upheaval in human societies such as the collapse of the @entity99 around 4,000 years ago and the fall of the @entity101 about 1,000 years later			1
dr @entity102 said : ‘ there were three large pulses of aridification as @entity4 went from a wetter to a drier climate - starting with the end of the @entity108 5,000 years ago when the monsoons shifted to the south			1
‘ at the same time human population densities were increasing and competition for space along the @entity10 would have had a large impact on animal populations			1
’ the most recent major shift in mammalian communities occurred about 100 years ago			2
the analysis of predator - prey networks showed species extinctions in the past 150 years had a disproportionately large impact on ecosystem stability			2
another stone tablet , kept in the @entity124 , shows human hunters armed with bows , spears , clubs and lassoes stalking lions , gazelles , hartebeest and an ostrich			0
dr @entity102 , of the @entity134 in @entity135 , explained that when there were many species in the area , the loss of any one had little impact on the rest , but now the ecosystem is much more sensitive to perturbations			2
dr @entity102 , who was at @entity145 in @entity146 when he carried out the study , added : ‘ what was once a rich and diverse mammalian community is very different now			0
‘ as the number of species declined one of the primary things lost was the ecological redundancy of the system			0
there were multiple species of gazelles and other small herbivores which are important because so many different predators prey on them			0
‘ when there are fewer of those small herbivores the loss of any one species has a much greater effect on the stability of the system and can lead to additional extinctions			0
’ the study , published in the journal @entity171 , is based on records compiled in zoologist @entity174 ’s 1998 book @entity175 , which was , itself , based on archaeological and palaeontological evidence , as well as historical records			0
dr @entity102 said : ‘ @entity174 compiled an incredible database of when species were represented in artwork and how that changed over time			0
his work allowed us to use ecological modelling techniques to look at the ramifications of those changes			0
’ the study looked at which animals lived in the @entity10 ( marked in green ) before the time of the @entity190 computer analysis identified five episodes when dramatic changes occurred in @entity4 ’s mammal population , three of which coincided with extreme environmental changes as the climate shifted to more arid conditions			1
these droughts also coincided with upheaval in human societies such as the collapse of the @entity99 around 4,000 years ago , and the fall of the @entity101 about 1,000 years later			1

dr @entity102 said these findings have implications for understanding modern ecosystems			0
‘ this may be just one example of a larger pattern			0
we see a lot of ecosystems today in which a change in one species produces a big shift in how the ecosystem functions - and that might be a modern phenomenon , ’ he said			0
computational analysis identified five episodes when dramatic changes occurred in @entity4 ’s mammals , three of which coincided with extreme environmental changes as the climate shifted to more arid conditions			1

37 large bodied mammals lived in @entity4 before the time of the *pharoahs*
now just eight of the species recorded by *ancient* *people* live in the area
experts studied etchings to look at *biodiversity* in the @entity10 , @entity4
computational analysis identified 5 episodes when changes occurred in @entity4 ’s mammals , 3 of which coincided with environmental changes
droughts also coincided with upheaval in human societies such as the collapse of the @entity99 around 4,000 years ago
