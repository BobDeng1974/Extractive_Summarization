@entity0 and @entity1 are the two best players in world football , but @entity4 is the heir to the throne			1
there is no doubt he can be the best player on the planet in five years ’ time			1
what @entity4 has achieved in his first season at @entity11 is nothing short of sensational			1
to go to a new club , a new country and an entirely new culture and perform as he has done is remarkable			0
he was not at his best on saturday night but big players change games and that ’s exactly what he ’s done			0
he scored a wonder goal to win the @entity24 last month and made the crucial breakthrough in extra time in the @entity27			1
the heir : @entity11 star @entity4 will become the best player in the world in five years ' time the very best : @entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) are considered the finest players in the world devastating : @entity4 and @entity0 have both been exceptional for @entity11 this season he wasted some good chances in @entity35 but if you want an indicator of the impact he had , just look at @entity40			1
the @entity41 left back has been excellent but he wo n’t have run as hard all season			1
by the end of the game he was on the floor with cramp			0
that ’s what happens when you spend your evening chasing @entity4 ’s shadow			0
explosive pace has always been @entity4 ’s primary weapon , but now he is the complete player			0
his raw speed makes him so hard to defend against but it ’s his technique at high speed that now sets him apart			0
the cap fits : @entity4 has proved he can match @entity0 's backwards baseball cap look off the pitch ripped : @entity0 celebrates his goal in the @entity27 final by tearing off his shirt spot the difference : @entity4 's celebration after netting against @entity41 was not dissimilar to @entity0 's technically the best : @entity0 blasts a rocket shot at goal while in action for @entity11 almost as good : @entity4 shows he can use his right foot just as well as his favoured left on the charge : @entity4 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) carry the attack for @entity11 with a rampaging run match winner : @entity4 is now the complete power , with excellent technique along with explosive pace chasing shadows : @entity40 is an excellent defender but he was run ragged by the @entity76 he can play anywhere across the front , score with his left or right foot and with his head			1
he has a fantastic leap and he showed it by being in the right place at the right time to score against @entity41			1
the frightening thing is he is still learning the game			0
playing alongside and studying @entity0 , he can only get better			0
@entity4 is so strong in the air but imagine if he attacked crosses with the same aggression as @entity0 — he could be impossible to stop			1
i remember seeing him play in the @entity91 youth team when i was at the club			0
most of the talk then was about a young @entity95 , but there was also a dark - haired kid who was a pretty handy left back			0
passive : @entity4 is good in the air but he needs to be more aggressive when he attacks the ball flourished : @entity4 has come a long way since his time as a left back for @entity91 he was very shy but once he came out of his shell it did not take long to realise you were in the presence of somebody special			2
it was the same at @entity111 when he started to play further forward and was shredding defences for fun			0
that shy young left back has transformed into quite a man			0
@entity4 now has the world at his feet but he remains that rarest of things : a humble superstar			2
i ’m sure if he wanted to whip his shirt off and celebrate @entity0 - style he ’d look just as good , but that ’s not how he is			2
@entity125 dragon : @entity4 celebrates his goal in the @entity27 final with @entity41 on saturday , the header putting his team 2 - 1 up in extra time sensational : @entity0 looks to the heavens in triumph after @entity11 beat @entity41 to win their 10th @entity27 copycats : @entity4 celebrates with arms outstretched after scoring at the @entity135 , while @entity0 ( below ) went topless for his carbon copy celebration trendsetters : @entity4 and @entity0 share the same tastes in fashion , especially for the backwards baseball cap technique : @entity0 ( above ) and @entity4 ( below ) generate speed and spin when striking the ball he is just a lovely kid and is the exception to those who say you need a mean streak to succeed in football			1
when you watch him play , you can still see the wonder in his eyes as if he ’s thinking : ‘ blimey , i ’m playing for @entity11			0
’ that is every football fan ’s dream but he ’s not just playing for @entity11 , he ’s starring for them			0
crowded out : both @entity0 ( above ) and @entity4 ( below ) possess the ability to fire off shots even in the busiest of penalty areas @entity158 superstar : @entity4 has now been instrumental in @entity11 winning two trophies in his debut season when he made the move last summer , i was full of admiration			1
playing for a club like @entity11 is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , but it takes a lot of courage to move abroad and plenty have failed in the past			2
@entity4 ’s debut season has been like a fairytale			2
@entity0 was 24 when he moved to @entity11 and he scored 33 goals in his opening season , 11 more than @entity4			1
but there is one big difference between the two : @entity0 won nothing whereas @entity4 has two trophies to his name			1
expectations at @entity11 are always sky - high , but that is some way to announce yourself			2
it ’s just a shame we are unlikely to see @entity4 play at his peak in a @entity186 because , make no mistake , he has everything needed to become the best player in the world .			2

@entity11 team - mate @entity0 and @entity193 rival are *undoubtedly* the two best players in the world , but the @entity76 is next in line
in five years ' time there is no doubt he can be the best
the former @entity111 winger has been sensational in his first season in @entity203
@entity4 scored the winner in the @entity24 and the crucial goal in the 4 - 1 victory over @entity41 as @entity11 won the @entity27
