by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity3 dentist who last week lost his $ 34,000 legal action against @entity5 after he and his partner were flown to @entity7 in the @entity8 instead of @entity9 in @entity10 has spoken out			1
dr. @entity11 flew from @entity12 to @entity13 in september of 2013 and instead of fulfilling his life - long dream of visiting the medieval city boarded a flight right back across the @entity18 after a ticketing mistake			1
' i had a conference in @entity22 , @entity23 , and i saw that as my opportunity to finally get to @entity10 , ' said dr. @entity11 , of @entity26 , @entity27 , to @entity28			1
' i had always wanted to see the @entity29 in @entity9 , @entity10			2
' @entity8 paradise : an @entity3 dentist visiting @entity32 has sued @entity5 after the airline refused to reimburse him for two first class tickets after flying him and his partner to @entity7 in the @entity8 instead of @entity9 in @entity10 however , @entity11 and his partner realized to their horror 20 minutes into their connecting flight that they were not flying southwards from @entity13 , back west			1
' within 20 minutes of departing … we look at this little monitor in front of us , and the plane ’s heading west , so i go up to the flight attendant and said , ‘ why west ? why not south ? we ’re going to @entity10 , ’ @entity11 recalled			1
' he said , ‘ @entity10 , what are you talking about ? we ’re going to @entity7			0
we ’re in the @entity48 , ’ and my heart just dropped			0
' @entity5 had allocated them incorrect tickets for their journey and even though @entity7 was clearly written out , @entity11 claims he did n't notice because he was on vacation			2
' we had just flown across the @entity18 first class and really enjoyed it			0
i think just my mindset was like , ‘ just lay back , and do n’t think about it , ’ said @entity11 to @entity28			0
once they arrived in the @entity8 , @entity11 and his partner hoped on a flight to @entity62 and from @entity62 they flew to @entity13 and eventually made it to @entity7			1
the couple spent three days flying on seven flights and spent $ 2,2776			0
' when i booked the trip , with @entity5 , not only was i specific on city and country , but i even gave airport codes , ' he said			0
holiday mistake : mr @entity11 always wanted to visit @entity29 in @entity9 , @entity10 , but he was sent to @entity7 in the @entity8 ' and i certainly had no way of anticipating that there could be a booking agent who did n’t know the difference between the @entity48 and @entity10			1
' in the aftermath of the ticketing mix up , @entity11 sued @entity5 for $ 34,000 based on the cost of the extra first class flights he paid for and the lost time in salary for when he would have been working			1
however , a court in @entity12 dismissed the case last week			0
@entity5 told @entity28 that they had tried to make up for the unfortunate error and the court was satisfied they had			0
' @entity5 is focused on providing exceptional service to all its customers , ' the statement said			0
' as a goodwill gesture we offered mr. @entity11 and his companion new flights to @entity9 , @entity10 , which they declined			1
' instead they accepted free - of - charge flights to an alternate destination and enough @entity98 frequent flyer points for them to book another trip in the future			0
' the customers also continued to pursue a legal case against @entity5 , which was dismissed by the court in @entity12 last week			2
' @entity11 denies that @entity5 ever made this offer			2
@entity11 told a @entity106 newspaper in june of his disappointment : ‘ i have a lifelong interest in @entity110 art. i ’m also of @entity10 @entity112 heritage so it was something i had always wanted to do to visit @entity9 and the @entity29			1
i made it absolutely clear to the booking agent i wanted to go to @entity9 in @entity10			2
why on earth would i want to go to @entity7 in the @entity8 if i was flying back to @entity3 from @entity22 ? ‘ it ’s just so sad			2
a trip we had been really looking forward to was ruined and ... @entity5 wo n’t do the decent thing			0
