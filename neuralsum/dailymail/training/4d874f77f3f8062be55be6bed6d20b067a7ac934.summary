by @entity0 it may look odd to us , but in the @entity6 @entity5 tribe , this enormous lip plate is actually a sign of beauty			1
when girls hit puberty they have their bottom two teeth removed in a bizarre ritual before a small hole is cut into their bottom lip			1
a clay disc is then inserted into the hole , which is steadily increased , stretching the lip , much like flesh - tunnel piercings which have become popular with teenagers in the @entity21			2
the larger the lip plate the more cows the girl 's father can demand in dowry when his daughter is married - usually 40 for a small plate and 60 for a larger one			2
men on the other hand take part in the considerably less - painful ritual of body painting			0
a basic paint is made from herbs and plants mixed with soil , before the tribesmen cover themselves with it , sculpting it into patterns			0
in recent years , some young women from the tribes are refusing to have their lips pierced , and removing their teeth can be a violent and sometimes traumatising task			0
a @entity5 tribeswoman from @entity6 is pictured wearing a large lip plug which is a traditional sign of beauty when a @entity5 girl reaches puberty her two bottom teeth are removed and a small clay plate inserted which is slowly increased			1
the larger the plate the more cows her father can demand in dowry when she marries @entity5 tribesmen engage in the less painful practice of body painting			1
they make a basic paint from soil , herbs and plants before scratching patterns into it			0
