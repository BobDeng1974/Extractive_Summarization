a press conference with the @entity2 ’s director of elite development @entity3 at @entity5 on wednesday will mark a considerable power shift in control of the @entity9 football team			1
@entity3 , already anointed by chairman @entity10 as the new technical director , will be giving a presentation of the ‘ @entity9 dna ’ that will act as the blueprint for the playing style and preparation of international teams and , hopefully , eventually lead to tournament success			1
the fact @entity3 is going public with his plans , formulated with his growing army of technical specialists handpicked since he arrived from @entity23 in september 2012 , shows he has the full backing of the @entity2 hierarchy to take the helm in plotting @entity9 football ’s future			1
@entity9 's director of football @entity3 will present his new blueprint to improve the @entity32 ' fortunes the @entity2 board , who had the first viewing of @entity3 ’s masterplan , want to give his department their head , knowing a proper long - term strategy is in place rather than the previous haphazard regime under sir @entity42			1
the repercussions will see the @entity44 - based @entity9 set - up having to fit in with @entity3 ’s agenda run from @entity5 , where the next @entity9 manager is more likely to have his main office within @entity3 ’s technical area			1
the @entity2 promised a sponsor for their flagship @entity50 would be in place by the third round of the tournament			1
but the draw takes place on monday with no sign of a backer to replace £ 9million - a - year @entity56			2
for the @entity2 ’s hapless commercial department , who brought in an expensive recruit from @entity61 for this search , it is a fiasco on a par with the @entity9 team exiting the @entity65 after two group matches			1
a spokesman said they ‘ remain confident ’ of finding that elusive sponsor			2
at least the @entity2 ca n’t be faulted for their scrupulous recognition of almost every military encounter in history			2
there are no fewer than three major set - pieces starting this weekend marking the centenary of the christmas truce football match with @entity77 in no - man ’s land , as well as twin team photos			1
the @entity2 are still struggling to find a flagship sponsor to replace @entity56 's £ 9million - a - year deal @entity82 would be keen to have @entity83 back on their roster of pundits following his departure from @entity87			1
but they will allow the @entity88 to concentrate on his role as assistant manager with the @entity91 before asking him back			2
meanwhile , @entity83 ’s autobiography remains high in the best - seller charts , while @entity95 ’s book , launched in the same week in october , is unlikely to remain in the top 10 next week			0
@entity82 will wait before asking @entity83 ( left ) to return on their roster of pundits the @entity98 sports awards has belied its low - key status by attracting world - class superstars @entity102 and @entity103 to pick up the main trophy in person over the last two years			0
monday night ’s bash at the @entity107 , @entity108 , also had @entity110 and darts world champion @entity109 presenting gongs			0
the event ’s big - spending sponsors @entity113 are prepared to splash the cash for personal appearances			0
@entity117 shun baa - baas it is no surprise that @entity117 2015 , who are heavily populated with staff from @entity123 , have gone for choreographer @entity124 and @entity126 ’s event team @entity125 , who both worked on the @entity128 ceremonies , to deliver the curtain raiser for the @entity130 next september			0
however , the 25 - minute show on the @entity133 pitch will not feature any of the live animals from @entity136 ’s @entity128 launch , with speculation still around on wednesday as to whether all the sheep survived the event			0
lt sums up the grandstanding by some mps over the @entity65 corruption inquiry that @entity144 mp @entity143 fancifully called for the @entity145 to get involved — even though it has no jurisdiction to do so			0
solicitor general @entity147 responded for the government by saying rugby is his ‘ first love ’			0
@entity151 posted his anti-semitic @entity153 picture despite having attended a session with social media specialists , laid on for all @entity157 staff , that explained the hazards facing public figures			0
@entity151 is in trouble after uploading an anti-semitic picture to his @entity153 account			0

@entity3 is @entity9 's current technical director of football
@entity3 has devised a presentation of the ' @entity9 dna ' that will act as a blueprint for all of the international teams
