it has risen in the last year by 0.4 per cent in the @entity50 to 16.4 per cent			0
in contrast , @entity52 's vacancy is 7.9 per cent			0

' of the top 10 best - performing town centres with the least vacant units , seven are in @entity52 and the @entity75			2
' he added : ' people have to realise these town centres are not going back to pre- 2008 levels and accept at least 20 per cent of shops there are no longer required			2
they have got to create smaller centres that pull viable businesses into a vibrant core			0
' the @entity85 said the way rates are set is unfair on high street shops and has called for a reform of the business rates system			1
it said retailers pay £ 7billion a year - which is £ 500million more than three years ago			2
another problem for high street shops is that more than 10 per cent of retail spending is now online , while many shoppers go to out - of - town retail parks to avoid pricey town centre parking charges			1
' @entity26 ' got £ 100,000 ­ government grants in 2012 tv guru @entity102 was appointed by the government to bring about a revival in areas worst affected by the economic downturn and the rise of out - of - town shopping centres			1

since the dark ages , governments have used a tax on residential and commercial property to pay for local services			0
but store groups are struggling to keep their costs and prices down to fend off competition from online rivals			0
the problem is not so much the imbalance in the amount of corporation tax paid by the likes of @entity173 and @entity174 - compared with their @entity3 - domiciled rivals - but business rates			1
at a time when online sales are rising fast and traditional retailers are struggling , business rates are effectively a tax on the high street			1

however , the traditional store chains find they are seeing profits fall but are paying a lot more in business rates			2
