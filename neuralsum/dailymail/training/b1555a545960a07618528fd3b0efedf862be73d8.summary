@entity0 has admitted exposing one of its workers to asbestos , which led to her developing a terminal lung cancer			1
@entity5 , 53 , worked in the flagship store on @entity7 in the 1970s and 1980s			1
last year she was diagnosed with mesothelioma , an incurable cancer linked to inhaling asbestos			1
mrs @entity5 , who has been given just months to live , says she feels betrayed and that the store ' ruined her life ' by exposing her to the deadly chemical			1
@entity0 admitted negligently exposing mrs @entity5 to the substance while she worked at the @entity7 store and another outlet in @entity28 , @entity29			1
after admitting liability at the @entity31 in @entity29 , @entity0 agreed to pay ' significant ' damages , and agreed an undisclosed figure with mrs @entity5 outside of court			1
after the settlement , mrs @entity5 , whose husband @entity35 also worked for @entity0 , said the company ' betrayed ' her			1
she said : ' i wish that i hard never worked for @entity0 at all , that i had never known @entity39 i worked for them i was proud to work for them - i was in the premier store			1
long service : mrs @entity5 spent years working at the flagship @entity0 store in @entity7 , @entity29 ' now i wish that i 'd never , ever worked for them because they 've ruined my life			1
' i felt betrayed , really			2
i worked hard for them ... i ca n't explain how angry it made me feel that they had such disregard for the safety of their staff			2
' the case is thought to be the first victory for a @entity0 employee who only ever worked on the shop floor , as opposed to staff such as builders and electricians who had direct contact			1
her case is thought to be the first in which judgment has been given in court for a @entity0 employee who was exposed to asbestos by simply working on the shop floor , as opposed to industrial contractors or electricians who came into direct contact with the substance			2
beginnings : mrs @entity5 , pictured left and right , started working at the store when she was a teenager			1
it was there she met her husband , @entity35 , centre right @entity80 , the law firm which acted for mrs @entity5 , has voiced concerns that many more workers could have contracted the deadly cancer through their working life			1
mesothelioma is a cancer of membrane cells which line major organs			2
it occurs most often in tissue around the lungs			0
symptoms of the disease include acute chest pains , such as mrs @entity5 suffered , a persistent cough and difficulty breathing , high temperatures and weight loss			1
more than 2,500 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma every year , with five times more men than women falling victim			1
according to the @entity106 , the disease is ' almost always ' caused by asbestos , and takes 20 to 60 years to develop after the initial exposure			0
the cancer can be difficult to diagnose accurately , as affected cells do not look distinctive			0
chemotherapy is the main treatment			0
some surgical procedures are being investigated , but remain unproven			0
because mesothelioma is so difficult to diagnose , it is often terminal by the time doctors notice			0
patients rarely survive more than three years after diagnosis			0
the average is 12 months			0
some 2,300 per year die of the disease , though experts expect this to increase as more workers exposed to asbestos in past decades are affected			0
by 2050 , it is thought the cancer will have taken 90,000 lives			0
@entity129 , a solicitor at @entity80 , said : ' it can take as long as 40 years for exposure to asbestos to manifest in those who have inhaled asbestos '			0
the case was aided by evidence from @entity135 , a @entity136 who had informed the @entity138 of the criminally unsafe work with asbestos at @entity0 ’s @entity142 branch , as a result of which the company was fined £ 1million			2
mr @entity135 also worked at the @entity145 in 1998 , and acted as a witness in @entity148 's legal claim			0
he told the @entity31 : ' there were minefields – asbestos minefields , for want of a better expression			2
you could not have guaranteed the safety of anybody – the workers , the staff , the customers			0
you could not have given a 100 per cent guarantee that those people were safe '			0
a @entity0 spokesman claimed the company could not comment on individual cases , but extended ' deepest sympathies ' to mrs @entity5			1
she also insisted that its stores are no longer dangerous			0
the spokesman said : ' this is an historic case and relates to times of exposure that pre-date the banning of asbestos , when the consequences of its everyday use were still unknown			0
' we had very clear policies in place that were the best they could be based on the knowledge of the time - but like other retailers and organisations with a large property portfolio dating back to the post war era , @entity0 will be subject to asbestos claims			2
' we are confident that we now have the most rigorous policy we can have in place and that @entity0 stores are safe for our employees and our customers			2

@entity5 , 53 , worked on @entity7 for the store in the 1970s and 80s
last year she was diagnosed with mesothelioma - a deadly lung cancer
