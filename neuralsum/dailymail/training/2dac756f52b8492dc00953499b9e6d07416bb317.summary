by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 22:30 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 19:49 est , 10 december 2012 fears over @entity4 are ‘ humbug ’ , the new farming minister insisted yesterday , arguing that many @entity6 happily eat beef from cattle fed on @entity10 crops			1
addressing public concern about the genetically modified food industry ’s increasing influence , @entity11 said : ‘ there is n’t a single piece of meat being served [ in a typical @entity19 restaurant ] where a bullock has n’t eaten some @entity10 feed			1
so it ’s a complete nonsense			0
’ but the environment secretary ’s dismissive response angered campaigners , who pointed out that consumers ’ apparent willingness to eat @entity10 - raised beef was simply a result of the food not being labelled as such			1
controversial : critics fear genetically modified foods can cause environmental harm and damage human health the row emerged as @entity35 said @entity36 was backing moves to speed up the approval process for controversial new @entity10 crops and food			1
ministers and officials are currently lobbying in @entity43 for the @entity44 to make it easier for @entity46 giants to cultivate their crops			0
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ the government has a position on @entity10 foods which is , provided that it ’s used safely and responsibly , it can deliver benefits and help address the challenge of global food security			1
‘ we have to ensure public safety and take decisions based on the scientific evidence , though in principle we are obviously supportive			0
if we can speed up a slow system then we should do that			0
’ mr @entity11 ’s support is a victory for the biotech giants , such as @entity67 , which have been lobbying ministers and officials			1
unfounded : @entity11 said concern about genetically modified food was ' a complete nonsense ' his stance is all the more remarkable as he was once a champion of organic farming			1
in 2000 he challenged @entity75 ministers to ensure proper separation distances around @entity10 crops to avoid contaminating regular crops			2
successive governments , including the @entity80 , have gone to great lengths to ensure there is no label to identify food that comes from animals reared on a @entity10 diet			2
as a result , shoppers can not know whether their food has a link to imports of @entity10 feed , such as corn or soya			2
currently , the only way to avoid @entity10 is to shop at @entity96 , which has a ban , or to choose organic meat , milk and eggs			2
mr @entity11 argued that the cultivation of @entity10 crops would have ‘ real environmental benefits ’			1
he said : ‘ emphatically we should be looking at @entity10 … i ’m very clear it would be a good thing			2
the trouble is all this stuff about “ frankenstein foods ” and “ putting poisons in foods ”			0
‘ there are real benefits , and what you ’ve got to do is sell the real environmental benefits			1
’ in fact , @entity6 ’s only large - scale gm crop farm trials – carried out ten years ago – found evidence of real harm to wild plants , insects , and , potentially , farmland birds such as the skylark			0
@entity124 research shows the widespread cultivation of @entity10 crops has brought disaster for many farmers following the emergence of superweeds and superbugs			0
in some cases the only way to remove the rampant weeds is with large quantities of highly toxic chemicals , machetes and flamethrowers to burn out their roots			0
at the same time , studies continue to raise questions over whether @entity10 crops and food are safe for human health			2
@entity143 , of the @entity144 , which campaigns against @entity10 , said : ‘ @entity11 says that people are eating meat from animals fed on @entity10 feed without realising it			1
that is because the @entity6 government has consistently opposed moves to label to give consumers accurate information , and he should put that right by immediately introducing compulsory labelling of meat and milk from animals fed on @entity10 feed			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity11 is wrong to claim that @entity10 crops are good for the environment			1
the @entity6 @entity150 ’s own farm - scale experiment showed that overall the @entity10 crops were worse for @entity6 wildlife			0
‘ @entity150 figures show that overall pesticide use has increased since @entity10 crops have been grown there , because , as scientists opposed to @entity10 predicted , superweeds and resistant insects have multiplied			0
’ @entity168 , of campaign group @entity169 , said : ‘ mr @entity11 has got his facts wrong as well as fundamentally misunderstanding why @entity10 is not grown or sold in the @entity6			1
‘ the @entity6 does not grow @entity10 crops because the government ’s own farm - scale trials showed a decade ago that @entity10 harms wildlife already threatened by industrial farming			0
‘ the evolution of superweeds and superbugs was an inevitable consequence of following a model of food production that still fails to deliver food to people who need it while causing considerable harm to the planet			0

environment secretary @entity11 said there are ' real environmental benefits ' to @entity10 *technology*
mr @entity11 claimed public concerns about genetically modified food were unfounded
