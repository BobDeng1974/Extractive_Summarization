back in 2001 , @entity0 launched its first straighteners - and transformed the hair of an entire nation			1
twelve years on , and @entity0 is launching a new straightener which promises even faster styling for the most unruly hair			1
but it ’s up against some pretty stiff competition			1
from straighteners infused with keratin and argan oil to steam shots and irons with built - in combs and heat protection , it ’s no longer just about two heated ceramic plates			1
with the help of @entity19 , senior stylist at @entity20 , we put some of the latest designs to the test			1
banishing curls : @entity25 tries the @entity27 straighteners simple but effective : cloud nine @entity28 cloud nine @entity28 , £ 54.95 , cloudninehair.com they say : at ‘ only six inches in length ’ this iron is undoubtedly micro and billed as ‘ perfect for styling on the go ’			1
@entity19 ’s view : a simple - to - use and good - quality mini iron			1
you would n’t want to use them on a lot of hair , but they ’d be great around the hairline , and because they have a relatively low fixed temperature it means you ’re less likely to fry the hair in this area , which tends to need lower temperatures as it ’s finer			2
verdict : 4/5 best for : short hair , or someone who can justify having a second pair specifically for the hairline , or touch - ups			2
get what you pay for : @entity56 @entity56 , £ 195 , ghdhair.com they say : ‘ breakthrough patented tri-zone technology ’ means there are six sensors in the plates which maintain a constant temperature , so even the unruliest hair only needs a single stroke			2
@entity19 ’s view : @entity0 established the market for straighteners in the @entity69 and this new pair upholds its reputation			1
i like the idea of a fixed temperature , as too often people straighten at 230c , which is just too high			2
these have no gimmicks , they feel good , glide well and have rounded edges so you can use them to curl , too			2
the @entity81 of irons , but i ’m not convinced they need to be so pricey - and this loses them a point			2
verdict : 4/5 best for : those who want the best and are prepared to pay for it			2
best for thick hair : @entity89 @entity89 , £ 150 , lorealprofessionel.co.uk they say : the accompanying water reservoir helps ‘ deliver a continuous flow of high - pressure steam ’			1
temperature : five settings , ranging from 170c to 210c			0
@entity19 ’s view : in the salon , we never use steam to straighten hair and we ’d never advise using irons on wet hair , as it ’s more prone to damage when wet			1
these certainly left hair wet after the first stroke			0
i do n’t think for most people the result justifies the hassle and the high price			0
verdict : 2/5 best for : thick , coarse hair that ’s difficult to blow - dry			0
do n't bother : @entity114 with @entity115 @entity114 with @entity115 , £ 49.99 , nickyclarke.com they say : a built - in comb that gives hair ‘ a smooth and shiny look and keeps a natural - looking amount of volume ’ , plus a tourmaline plate that helps lock moisture in			0
temperature : six settings up to 230c			0
@entity19 ’s view : there is some evidence tourmaline can produce ions that help give a smoother finish to hair , but that did n’t help these			1
the plates did n’t feel smooth , the controls were easy to knock and the comb is pointless			0
square plates mean you ca n’t use them to curl			0
rubber at the ends to stop you burning your fingers was a nice touch			0
verdict : 1/5 best for : sorry , do n’t bother , they ’re cheap and they feel it			0
did n't impress : @entity148 @entity150 , £ 79.99 , @entity149 they say : a ‘ unique conditioning treatment reservoir ’ in the straighteners is designed to be filled with a heat protection mist			1
this means , according to the manufacturer , ‘ you can skip a step and do n’t have to worry about heat damage			0
’ temperature : five settings from 160c to 230c			0
@entity19 ’s view : the reservoir was really fiddly and made the straighteners very heavy			1
they did n’t glide through hair like they should and did n’t impress overall			0
verdict : 1/5 best for : save your money and buy the @entity171 ones at the same price instead ( right )			0
reduces damage to hair : @entity175 @entity175 , £ 89.99 , argos.co.uk they say : ‘ @entity177 are infused in the @entity178 coated plates ’ and with a ‘ heat protection sensor ’ that lowers the temperature if your hair is wet to prevent damage			1
these reduce breakage by up to 57 per cent compared with standard straighteners			1
temperature : five settings from 160c to 230c @entity19 ’s view : these went through the hair nicely and i like the idea that they adjust the heat if they think it ’s damaging your hair			1
the company says the keratin - a protein that ’s an essential part of strong hair - comes to the surface of the plates when you heat them			1
they guarantee the keratin will last at least five years			1
if it ’s true that ’s quite impressive			0
verdict : 3/5 best for : anyone who wants to minimise damage to their hair			0
style over substance : @entity220 @entity220 , £ 99.99 , @entity149 they say : ceramic plates are infused with @entity224 argan oil , which helps them ‘ glide through each section to smooth , remove frizz , condition and add amazing shine ’			1
temperature : eleven settings from 120c to 220c			0
@entity233 ’ view : once you get over the garish animal print styling - they come in different colours , too - they slide through the hair really nicely			2
the argan oil is a bit gimmicky because while it does make the plates smoother so they glide through the hair more quickly , you ’re not left with any oil on your hair so it ’s a bit misleading			0
it ’s not bad , but it seems like more of a fashion item			0
verdict : 3/5 best for : trend - obsessed teens			0
not bad : @entity254 @entity255 , £ 79.99 , @entity149 they say : heated plates are coated in 100 per cent titanium ‘ which helps to reduce the build up of bacteria and provide hair with maximum moisture protection ’			0
temperature : five settings from 150c to 230c @entity19 ’s view : these feel more expensive than they are , they ’re not too heavy and the temperature gauge is in a sensible place			1
i ’d argue ‘ build up of bacteria ’ is n’t a real problem for straighteners , but they went through the hair well and did n’t catch too badly when i used them to curl			2
verdict : 4/5 best for : an everyday straightener and a more pocket - friendly price than @entity282 .			2
