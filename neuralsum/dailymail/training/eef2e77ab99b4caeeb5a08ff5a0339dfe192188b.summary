as research topics go , it has to be one of the most bird - brained			2
a university has received £ 2million of taxpayers ’ cash to investigate how humans have got on with chickens over the past 8,000 years			0
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) awarded the grant to a three - year study , led by @entity12 , called ‘ @entity13 ’			1
@entity14 ( pictured ) reader in @entity16 at @entity12 is involved in the three year study			1
the controversial £ 2m grant , will be used to fund experts from six universities while they examine and collate data , write articles and go on field trips to examine the history of the chicken but critics have reacted with fury that public money is going to such a project while funds for the disabled and sick are being cut			1
some of the cash will even be used to send students to live in @entity34 and @entity35 to learn about how people there interact with chickens			1
the study begins in january , and will involve archaeologists , phd students , geneticists and anthropologists			2
project leader @entity14 , reader in archaeology at @entity12 , said : ‘ what we uncover about chickens may lead us to find out more of a wider history about the people keeping them			1
’ and he defended the size of the grant , saying it will be shared between university researchers at @entity12 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
the results of the research will be used in a series of exhibitions in museums across @entity64			0
some of the funding will be used to send students to live in @entity34 and @entity35 ( pictured ) to study how people there interact with chickens			1
but taxpayer campaign groups are crying fowl over the publicly funded project and have branded it a ' ridiculous study ' the three - year investigation will start in january and will be carried about by academics including archaeologists , phd students , geneticists , and anthropologists			1
researchers will examine when domesticated chickens spread across @entity82 and when humans started using them for meat and eggs a spokesman for the @entity9 said : ‘ today there are well over 20billion chickens worldwide , yet we still know very little about their social and cultural history			0
pugh our attitudes towards chickens are complex – from the rituals of the roast dinner on sunday and the convenience of fast food , to named birds kept in back yards			0
‘ this project will conduct detailed analysis of their natural and cultural history in the @entity103 and the findings will be shared with poultry breeders and schoolchildren			2
’ but @entity108 , of the @entity109 ’ @entity107 , said yesterday : ‘ this is frankly an absurd sum of money to spend on what appears to be a ridiculous study			1
‘ given the limited budget and important challenges facing the @entity64 , research like this should be way down the pecking order for taxpayer - funded grants			0
’ meanwhile , the @entity121 is struggling to secure £ 40,000 of funding to maintain services it offers to vulnerable people			0
its chief executive , @entity125 , said : ‘ i am really struggling to see why funding something of this nature should take priority over a charity supporting disabled people			0
‘ i am also struggling to understand the need for this research , especially given how tight funding is for a charity like ours			0
‘ we have spoken to the local authority several times about funding without success			0

the money will be used to send students to live in @entity34 and @entity35 as well as to pay academics for collating data and writing reports
the @entity12 - led project aims to investigate the history of the birds , which could tell *scientists* more about the people who kept them
the @entity107 has branded the three year study ' ridiculous ' and a ' waste of money '
