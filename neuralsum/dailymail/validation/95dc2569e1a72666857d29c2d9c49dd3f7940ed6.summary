in february , they were up 187 per cent ; and so far this month , nearly 250 per cent			2
the boom is just one sign that the rush is on to see @entity1 now — before , as many predict , @entity12 's claims a spot in @entity6 and @entity14 moves in on @entity15 , the island 's premium coffee brand			1
the sense that detente will unleash an invasion of @entity22 tourists and change the unique character of one of the world 's last remaining bastions of communism is shared by many travelers flocking here			0
bookings to @entity1 have spiked since news of the @entity31 government restoring ties with the government in @entity6 bookings to @entity1 jumped 57 percent for one @entity3 tour operator in the weeks after it was announced that the @entity31 would restore diplomatic ties , despite the fact that the @entity31 embargo remains largely in place ' @entity1 has a very authentic atmosphere which you see nowhere else in the world , ' @entity39 of @entity40 said while walking through @entity44			1
' i wanted to see it before the @entity31 world ... but also the modern western world comes here			2
' outsiders may romanticize the ' time - capsule ' nation , but many on the island are ready for change			0
where foreigners see charming , historic architecture , bright 1950s - era @entity31 cars and vast stretches of white - sand beaches , locals see decaying buildings in need of repair , new vehicles priced beyond their reach and a lack of economic opportunity			2
for many @entity1 living in dilapidated , multigeneration tenements , change could be good			2
it may expand access to the @entity72 and the outside world , creating engagement that could bring brighter economic days and , practically speaking , make it easier to fix a leaky roof			0
' we 're very excited , ' said @entity79 , a 26 - year - old @entity81 major at the @entity82 who moonlights as a tour guide			0
it 's unlikely @entity1 will see major changes overnight			2
talks to take the first steps toward normalized relations are just beginning and there is stiff opposition in the @entity92 to lifting the 53 - year - old embargo that bars most trade with and travel to the island			2
still , the december announcement appears to have sparked an influx of tourism			0
the sense that the future will unleash an invasion of @entity22 tourists and change the unique character of one of the world 's last remaining bastions of communism is shared by many travelers flocking to @entity1 a tourist gets out of a classic @entity31 car in @entity6 , @entity1			1

tourism , a $ 2.6 billion - plus industry , is one of the main engines that has kept @entity1 's economy sputtering along			1
last year , the country welcomed 3 million visitors , a record			1
about 600,000 @entity31 travelers are estimated to visit @entity1 each year , most of them @entity141 visiting family but also tens of thousands coming on approved cultural , religious and educational exchanges			1
an untold number of others have , for years , skirted travel restrictions by journeying through third countries such as the @entity149 or @entity150			0
@entity1 officials estimate that 1.5 million @entity31 would travel here annually if all restrictions were removed , supplanting @entity154 as the no. 1 source of tourism and potentially adding some $ 2 billion a year to state coffers			1
however , the island is hardly ready for a @entity22 invasion			0
already it strains to accommodate travelers during the december - april high season			0

some travel agents report being turned away when trying to book group reservations			0
@entity188 , a tourist from @entity154 , predicts demand will continue to outpace capacity			0
' i see a lot of construction , very nice restorations — that 's very good , ' he said			0
' but there wo n't be enough hotels			0
there wo n't be enough restaurants			0
there wo n't be enough services to accommodate the @entity31 who will come like rats on a ship			2
' privately run b&bs and diners that have mushroomed under president @entity206 's economic reforms could help ease the load on the government 's 64,000 hotel rooms and bland , poorly stocked restaurants			0
the recently renovated @entity6 airport is set to undergo a $ 207 million expansion led by @entity215 conglomerate @entity213			1
several @entity31 airlines have talked of launching service to the island ; currently all @entity31 - @entity1 flights are operated by charter companies			1

@entity238 @entity237 , head of @entity240 - based tour operator @entity239 , expressed hope that @entity1 would reserve some quota of capacity for @entity245 travelers			2
' we tour operators , ' he said , ' can say that we view the arrival of @entity31 tourism with trepidation			0
' for now , @entity237 is busy tending to travelers interested ' in experiencing this @entity1 , and right away			0
' @entity79 , the university student and tour guide , dismisses concerns that the island will lose its character			0
@entity1 , he said , eagerly await change but wo n't allow their country to become the capitalist playground it was before the 1959 revolution			0
' it 's not going to be that way			0
our identity , we will preserve it at all cost , ' he said			0
' that 's why i think that it 's going to be really hard for you to find a @entity12 's or a @entity14 right down the corner			0
' @entity272 , a 28 - year - old tourist from @entity273 , @entity81 , however , was among the visitors taking in the experience of seeing @entity1 now — before , he said , it risks becoming ' another outpost of @entity278			1
' some @entity245 visitors to @entity1 are afraid that the @entity31 opening up to the island risks it becoming ' another outpost of @entity278			1
' tourists cross traffic lights in @entity6 , @entity1			1
