ambulance bosses are routinely making a 21,500 - mile round trip to @entity2 to hire paramedics on £ 4,500 ‘ golden hello ’ payments because it is far cheaper than training them in @entity7			1
managers from the @entity9 , the largest in the @entity10 , have just filled 225 vacant posts with applicants from @entity13 and @entity14			1
they were recruited on the back of a series of practical demonstrations on dummies , a written exam and an interview that lasted in all between four and six hours			0

the selection process , held at five - star hotels , was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job the increasing demand on ambulances means they are taking longer to reach the seriously ill. as a result , many paramedics are choosing to take up posts as ‘ advanced practitioners ’ in @entity57 , gp surgeries and call centres for the 111 helpline where the work is less stressful and they can earn more			1
@entity9 has been the hardest hit by this exodus			0
currently 340 posts are vacant , a fifth of the total workforce needed			0

@entity103 , director of operations at @entity9 , said : ‘ it ’s not our long - term solution but is helping us fill a skills shortage while we train more people to become paramedics in the @entity7			1

we will spend a minimum of two years there			0

’ @entity147 , 23 , from @entity148 in the @entity149 , @entity150 , said she was encouraged to move to @entity102 after talking to friends given jobs in september			2

managers from the @entity9 just filled 225 vacant posts
applicants all from @entity13 and @entity14 recruited after one day of tests
latest example of how @entity10 recruits overseas as it fails to train staff in @entity7
hospital managers have been hiring batches of 30 nurses on trips to @entity36
paramedics are being offered £ 4,500 ‘ golden hellos ’ if they agree to move to @entity7 within three months .
managers are so *anxious* to fill posts that 91 per cent of those who turned up to *assessments* were offered jobs .
applicants told the @entity45 they had been promised a ‘ new lifestyle ’ that would enable them to gain *valuable* experience , visit *distant* relatives and ‘ shoot off ’ to @entity36 for the weekend .
the few paramedics who did **n’t** get jobs when managers first flew out in september were so keen they returned for the latest round of recruitment days – and *vowed* to turn up a third time if they still were **n’t** hired .
managers claim they can save the @entity10 £ 9million by flying out to @entity2 rather than training paramedics in @entity7 .
