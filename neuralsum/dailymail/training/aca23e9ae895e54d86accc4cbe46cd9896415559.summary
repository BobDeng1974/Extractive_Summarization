she was working full - time in a demanding job while raising her two young boys on her own , but that did n't stop @entity4 from transforming her life			1
five years ago and 28 kilograms heavier than she is now , @entity4 was unhealthy and exhausted , and had never stepped foot in a gym in her life			1
eating a lot of processed food while trying to maintain her energy and a balance in her life , the busy mum decided something had to give			1
' i was never overweight before i had the boys , ( but ) when i was pregnant i put on 28 kilos , and that 's when i really realised i needed to make a change , ' the 25 - year - old told @entity19			1
then once the weight started to shift she would get up at 4am in the morning and work out at home before heading off to a full day at her job			1
she used anything she would get her hands on in the house to train with , and soon the results really started to show			2
' i would use stairs at the house , do step ups on chairs , fill water bottles up and use them as weights ' , @entity4 revealed			1
' i would try and utilise anything i could			0
' about 18 months after she first decided to get healthy , @entity4 signed up the gym for the first time in her life			1
' i had never really been into a gym before i had my kids , i had never stepped into a gym			2
' while training one day she was approached by a coach who offered to sponsor her so she could compete in a bodybuilding competition			1
when @entity4 said she did n't think it was for her , he gave her another option			1
' he said " okay , i 'll train you for six months and if you do n't want to hop on stage you do n't have to "			0
' but by the time six months came around i was so confident , i hopped on stage and i won , then i went on to nationals and i won nationals , ' @entity4 said			1
her most recent title is from the @entity71 held in @entity72 - one of the most prestigious competitions worldwide - where @entity4 placed fifth overall			1
' competing was never really my goal , it sort of just fell into my lap , ' she revealed			0
@entity4 said bodybuilding ' sort of fell into my lap ' but despite this she won the first competition she entered in march the mum - of - two placed fifth in the @entity71 held in @entity72 - one of the world 's most prestigious competitions after she had built up some cardio endurance , @entity4 would get up at 4am to work out before heading to an eight hour day at her job although @entity4 acknowledged that exercise was crucial to her transformation , she said there 's nothing better in the world you can do for yourself than ' eat clean '			1
' when i started implementing the nutrition changes that 's when the weight really dropped off			0
' for the most part , @entity4 's family consumes only food they have made themselves , the bulk of which is prepared twice a week - on a sundays and wednesdays			1
her kids - now six and seven - help make and pack their own school lunches , and @entity4 said she likes the keep them involved in the whole process			1
' we go to the markets , we get what they want and they 're there form the beginning , ' she said			0
' @entity111 wraps with chicken or lamb and salad they 'll make that themselves			0
' sweet potato chips and homemade roll - ups made in a dehydrator also pop up in the kids ' lunchboxes , as well as banana bread and blueberry muffins			0
but this has caused some clashes in the past , and one particular confrontation with her eldest son 's first pre-school comes to mind for @entity4			2
' my eldest son had started kindergarten and i sent him to school with some healthier options , but when i picked him up i had a little fine for a $ 6 lunch voucher because they had to give him lunch			0
' ' he had quinoa bread and banana bread ... they said to me that unfortunately it does n't meet their nutritional needs and he could nâ€™t eat it , ' @entity21 said			0
getting the kids involved is also a great way to keep them occupied while you work out the mum - of - two said while she was never overweight , she felt slow and her energy levels were nowhere near where they are today getting the whole family involved is a great way to get active and outdoors , like taking a bike ride or going for a hike @entity4 said homemade blueberry muffins was also off the cards according to the school , who told her the nutritional requirements were that children bring a sandwich with a spread , @entity165 , honey , or jam			1
@entity4 was also accused of sending her son to school with nuts , despite quinoa being a grain			2
' i pulled them out of that kindy , for obvious reasons ' , she laughed			0
one a more serious note she added : ' i think that they need to put more guidelines in place including options that mums can send in to schools that are nutritious			2
' with one book already under her belt , @entity184 , and another due for release this month , my kids eat , @entity4 said the key to maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle comes down to preparation			2
' buy everything in bulk , there 's quite a few health food stores where you can buy kilos of things especially things like dates			0
' always buy in season , that 's so important			0
' and everyone always says they 're too scared to buy my cookbooks because they think they need special equipment			0
the only thing that i recommend is a good food processor , ' @entity4 said			2
some of her other top tips for busy mums included not doing the groceries hungry , always buy fresh produce in season , and ditching the coffee dates for the beach instead			0
' instead of catching up for coffee or dinner i try and catch up with friends by going to beach , walk , bike , hike			0
do n't base your social life around food , ' @entity4 said			1
she acknowledged that exercise was crucial to her transformation , she said there 's nothing better in the world you can do for yourself than ' eat clean ' the mum said preparation and organisation is the key to leading a successful healthy lifestyle @entity4 and her husband - also a champion bodybuilder - now run a gym and coaching busines now working as a coach herself at her husband 's gym , the busy mum said she has no plans to return to competition just yet			1
' i just have so many beautiful girls i 'm training at the moment and i do n't want to do that to them , ' @entity4 laughed			2
she stressed to all the busy mums - and others - out there , you certainly do n't need a gym membership to lead an active lifestyle			2
@entity4 still trains at home when she needs to , and even incorporates her kids during school holidays			1
' we have 15 litre water container bottles and i will hold that and do lunges , squats , sit ups , anything , ' she revealed			0
' i will even use my boys as weights , ' @entity21 said			0
' ( @entity269 ) lot of my exercise now is fun - based , they 're ( her kids ) at the age now where we go for bike rides , go for a surf , the boys like to kick a foot around at the part , that sort of thing .			0
