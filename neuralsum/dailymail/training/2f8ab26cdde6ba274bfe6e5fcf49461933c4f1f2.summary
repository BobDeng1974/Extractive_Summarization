@entity1 prop @entity0 expects to face a ' hurting ' @entity3 team when @entity4 tackle the @entity3 at @entity5 on sunday			1
it is just over three months since @entity4 inflicted a 45 - 0 drubbing on @entity3 - their record victory in the fixture - and another win this weekend would complete a first season 's league double over the @entity3 since 2004			1
but while @entity4 are on a five - game unbeaten @entity14 run and they will remain second in the table behind leaders @entity19 whatever happens on sunday , a @entity3 triumph could lift them into the title play - off zone			1
the @entity3 players look dejected after their 45 - 0 defeat against @entity4 back in september @entity25 of @entity4 is mobbed by his team mates after scoring in his side 's record victory against @entity3 @entity4 's @entity29 ( centre ) lifts his arms in celebration as the final whistle is blown at the @entity34 ' when you face @entity3 at home , they are always going to be a different proposition , ' said @entity0 , who lines up in a @entity4 side that also features rugby league recruit @entity42 making his first @entity14 start , appearing at outside centre			1
' they 've got a lot of players back , and the whole team will be hurting			0
' i am sure the 45 - 0 defeat will be on their minds			1
that was not the @entity3 anyone knows , and to beat them by that big a margin was a surprise for everyone , as much as a brilliant win for us			1
' but they 're getting together their power game through the pack , and they have got momentum now			0
' for their part , @entity3 recovered from successive @entity68 and domestic losses to @entity69 and @entity19 by staging a thrilling fightback to pip @entity71 32 - 30 last time out after being 15 points adrift			1
@entity4 and @entity1 prop @entity0 said that he expects to face a ' hurting ' @entity3 side ' we had lost two games leading into the @entity71 game , so it could have been easy for us to throw in the towel and accept defeat			1
to win in that manner was massive for us , ' @entity3 number eight @entity82 said			1
' it is going to be a tough one for us on sunday			0
' there is a bit of a bad taste in our mouths , but it is just another @entity14 game			2
we have not really spoken about the revenge aspect			0
' we owe them one , if you like , but we ca n't be as naive as we were down there			0
we probably need the points more than them at the moment			0
' @entity3 welcome back @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 from injury , while @entity42 forges @entity4 's midfield partnership with @entity104 , and four changes up front see starts for @entity0 , his fellow prop @entity107 , lock @entity108 and number eight @entity109			1
@entity3 recovered from successive @entity68 and domestic losses by beating @entity71 32 - 30 wasps expect a crowd of around 15,000 for their second @entity14 game at @entity116 's @entity115 on sunday , where victory over fellow play - off hopefuls sale would keep them firmly in the mix. ' we will be working hard to produce an 80 - minute performance on sunday , and we know we will need to be at our best against a strong @entity71 side , ' said @entity112 rugby director @entity122 , who includes former sale players @entity123 , @entity125 and @entity126 in his starting xv			1
' sale are a battle - hardened team with a fantastic driving lineout and some @entity131 players who can win games for them , so we know the threat they will bring			2
' while we were n't happy with aspects of our performance last sunday ( against @entity138 ) , it was good to get the monkey off our back by getting an away win in the @entity14			2
' @entity112 director of rugby @entity122 knows his side will need to be at their best against @entity71 on sunday @entity144 , 15 points adrift at the @entity14 basement following 11 successive league defeats , continue their domestic campaign at home against @entity150 on sunday			2
but despite what appears to be a hopeless position , head coach @entity151 insists the mood remains a positive one			0
' there is nobody in our environment burying their head in the sand , and that would be quite easy to do , ' he said			0
' it 's about rolling our sleeves up , continuing to work hard and continuing to look for that first win			2
' it seems to be a given for many now that we will be relegated , but we do n't see it that way			0
' we are 15 points adrift and there are 11 games left , but that 's not something we discuss			0
what we discuss is that we need to keep focusing and working hard			0
' people are still upbeat , and it 's still a good place to be			0

@entity0 is looking *forward* to facing a ' hurting ' @entity3 side
the last time the sides met @entity4 were victorious in a record 45 - 0 win
@entity0 's @entity4 are on a five - game unbeaten run in the @entity14
