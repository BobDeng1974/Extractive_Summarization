a range of tiny @entity11 have gone on sale for those who want to recreate laid - back life in @entity15			1
but they do n't come cheap - it could end up costing you the @entity19			2
a spacious @entity15 ' cottage ' - based on @entity23 ' home @entity21 - will set you back $ 14,995			2
what would @entity25 think ? the @entity11 start at $ 995 and the most expensive one - the spacious @entity15 cottage - costs $ 14,995 made to order : each @entity29 is hand crafted by a family firm run by husband and wife team @entity34 and @entity35 fit for the shire : the tiny homes have recreated the traditional dwellings of @entity9 's fictional @entity29 those not willing to shell out for the luxury property can choose from cheaper 20sq ft chicken coops for $ 995			1
each @entity29 is hand crafted to order by family firm @entity43 run by husband and wife team @entity34 and @entity35 in @entity45			2
@entity35 said : ' @entity34 had been doing traditional carpentry for over 15 years and he was ready for a change			0
' he was not only bored with the work , but we also have a young family , two sons @entity52 , three and @entity53 , one , so we wanted to build a home - based business			0
' @entity11 are just one of many fantastical structure concepts brewing in @entity34 's mind , but once we built the @entity29 prototype , the idea started to gain traction and we 've built the product line from there			0
' in between the chicken coop and the fully pimped @entity5 cottage are playhouses , garden sheds , and other outdoor structures to beautify your landscape			1
just like @entity21 : the company hopes to cash in on the hype surrounding the forthcoming film @entity5 @entity73 as @entity23 in the forthcoming film @entity5 ( left )			1
@entity74 as @entity75 and @entity76 as @entity25 in @entity2 ( right ) @entity34 had been doing traditional carpentry for more than 15 years before he started building @entity78 other uses customers have dreamed up for their @entity5 holes include saunas , reading rooms , bus stops , garden sheds , storage space , doghouses , yoga studios and meditation rooms			1
@entity35 added : ' we also have a @entity29 kit product line in development , which is particularly exciting because it will really broaden our reach			0
' the products in our current lines are delivered fully built and finished			0
while this allows us to have a highly customisable product , it also means there 's a limit to how far we can sell them before the cost of delivery becomes prohibitively expensive			0
' the kit options we 're working on will give folks outside @entity106 an opportunity to purchase a reasonably priced @entity108			0
