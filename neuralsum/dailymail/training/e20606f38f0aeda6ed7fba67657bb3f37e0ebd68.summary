transport minister @entity0 said today that @entity1 must build new roads that ' lift the soul ' and banish the ugly and ' brutalist ' monstrosities of the past @entity1 must build new roads that ' lift the soul ' and banish the ugly and ' brutalist ' monstrosities of the past , transport minister @entity0 said today			1
he announced that new highways will in future have to pass a ' beauty test ' before they are built , with local residents and campaigners having a key voice in their design			1
they should ' invoke the spirit of poet sir @entity17 and be in ' harmony ' with their surroundings and ' blend in ' with the landscape rather than being ' brutalising , ugly and dull '			1
a special ' @entity23 ' comprised of campaign groups , architects , engineers , highways authorities and suppliers , would have vet a new highway 's aesthetic appeal			0
firms bidding for road contracts will have to consider beauty – not just cost - cutting budgets - when tendering			1
the aim is to end fifty years of brutalist blight since the 1960s when @entity1 got it ' very , very wrong ' and to create a future where @entity1 is ' criss - crossed by award winning roads ' rather than ' hideous footbridges			1
' mr @entity0 said : ' i want design to create new landmarks that will be featured in local guides for decades to come			1
' i want new bridges that are not only useful but that are loved by the people who use them			0
' the minister 's plan to end decades of poorly designed highways in the countryside and inner - cities was unveiled at an event hosted by the @entity57 and the @entity58 and attended by former poet laureate sir @entity59 who chairs the @entity57			1
mr @entity0 said : ' there is a well - trodden path we have been down as a nation many times when it comes to major public projects over the past century – and that is the path of mere utility , of banality , even ugliness			1
' the former energy minister who insists ' wind turbines are ' simply ugly ' said the view from the driver 's seat of a legendary @entity74 should be as beautiful as the car itself : ' it 's perhaps ironic that we care so much about car design , about the sleek lines gracing our sports saloons , about the leather trimmed interiors and the burr walnut dashboards … when the scene outside the car is often so ugly			1
' the former energy minister who insists ' wind turbines are ' simply ugly ' said the view from the driver 's seat of a legendary @entity74 ( pictured ) should be as beautiful as the car itself the rot set in after the 1950s , he said : ' as the road network developed we seem to have cared less and less about good design			1
we grew to accept that roads and motorways must be intrinsically ugly			1
' but he insisted : ' i believe roads can lift the soul			2
' he made a strong connection between ugly roads and the ' failure of tower blocks as a social experiment ' from the 1960s and ' 70s noting : ' it seems so obvious that beautiful buildings and places can places designed in harmony with nature can often lift the spirits and inspire people … while so many discordant , ugly , post-war tower blocks and housing estates have blighted lives and destroyed communities			1
' mr @entity0 drew on the @entity118 's ten design principles set out last year as inspiration for government plans to build £ 15billion of new roads by 2020 announcing a ' fresh start ' , he said : ' roads are part of our landscape			1
we can not uninvent the car or order people to stay in the village of their birth			0
so we need to integrate roads into their surroundings , flowing with the landscape or concealing structures where possible			2
' he said : ' beauty should not just be seen as a ' nice to have ' something important that can enhance well - being			2
' we want roads to be based on principles of good design '			1
and he noted : ' good design need be no more expensive than bad design			2
' he said the @entity143 and the planned @entity144 by - pass were examples of what could be achieved while the @entity149 viaduct on the @entity150 was an example of what to avoid			2
citing bold new stations on the railways he said : ' we have reclaimed the vision of sir @entity156 , whose statue rightly adorns the reborn @entity158			0
' i want to see a similar vision for our road network and for the service areas , the bridges and tunnels that are integral to it			0
' he stressed : ' let 's be absolutely clear			0
for a long time we got it very , very wrong			0
we allowed sub-standard , ubiquitous , drab , cheap , soul - sapping design to proliferate until it became the norm			2
and as a nation we shrugged our shoulders			0
' he also noted : ' as individuals we may not have liked it			0
but collectively as governments , local councils , highways authorities , motorist organisations , architects , we did n't do anything to change it			0
' but he stressed : ' right now we have an opportunity to banish ugly design from new road schemes and make sure it never returns			1
' more tunnels and better noise barriers will help roads blend more easily into the landscape			2
but @entity192 light pollution should not be at the expense of road safety			0
in 1994 , prince @entity118 began developing @entity195 ( pictured ) , an eco-village in @entity197 , inspired by his ideas about architecture and planning as an example of what can be achieved , roads minister @entity0 cited the recent @entity204 bypass : ' a tunnel was built to bypass the village of @entity204 and remove a notorious traffic bottleneck			1
' developers planted 200,000 trees and shrubs to provide a magnificent haven for wildlife and lovers of our countryside			0
' the scheme reunited two previously split commons creating the largest area of lowland heath in @entity1 and the @entity220 sowed heather on broken earth where the old road had been			0
the @entity225 main road into @entity226 from @entity227 to @entity229 @entity228 – lined with local @entity226 hedges of stone and vegetation - is another ' award - wining ' scheme			0
the proposed @entity234 to bypass the ancient monument in @entity236 is among the schemes that also exemplify ambitions for the future , as well as the @entity240 on the @entity241 and the @entity242 in @entity243 where design and environmental concerns have been considered			2
he said : ' i want these schemes to be trail - blazers for the future – a future where @entity1 is criss - crossed by award - winning roads			2
' by contrast he cited the @entity149 viaduct on the @entity150 as an example of what to avoid , describing it as ' a set of brutalist monoliths that seem to have escaped from the grimmer end of some @entity261 metropolis			0
' and with some councils fretting more about the plight of newts than the landscape , he said : ' some recent examples of good practice have perhaps focussed too much on local amphibian populations			0
' mr @entity0 noted : ' ring - roads , footbridges , underpasses and pedestrianisation have all served to create a destructive sense of alienation from the built environment			1
' he said he wanted to put ' pride ' back into @entity278 roads : ' our goal is not just to undo the most intrusive road design of the past 50 years			1
it is to create new aesthetic values that reflect and even magnify the beauty of the local landscape			2
' mr @entity0 plans to appoint a special ' @entity23 ' including campaign groups such as the @entity57 and architects , engineers and suppliers , to ' enhance the beauty of the countryside ' while also involving local communities in planning			1
local people would be involved early in design issues and at public consultation stage			2
under the new proposals materials , size and pavements and other aspects of design could be considered locally			0
he also drew on the @entity118 's ten design principles set out last year as inspiration for government plans to build £ 15billion of new roads by 2020			1
in 1994 , prince @entity118 began developing @entity195 , an eco-village in @entity197 , inspired by his ideas about architecture and planning			0
the eco-village – which is now home to 5,000 residents – was built so the houses , pedestrian - friendly streets , squares and lanes reflect the surrounding landscape and architecture			0
sir @entity59 , president of the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) and former poet laureate welcomed the ministers plans but said building new roads through the countryside should in any case be a ' last resort '			0
he said : ' the minister 's ambition to create a greater harmony between our road network and our priceless countryside is a noble aim , and i wholeheartedly welcome his understanding that our roads must be improved for the benefit of communities and the countryside			1
' i hope his ideas for blending existing roads with the landscape - while reducing the noise , air and light pollution they produce - are taken just as seriously by his colleagues in the government			1
and in outlining such good ideas for improving our existing roads , it raises the question - why spend the vast majority of the @entity353 's budget on new roads ? ' sir @entity59 said : ' if we care about the countryside – its look , its feel , its sustainability , its durability - we must not trail yet more concrete highways through green fields , so they can simply fill up with more cars , emitting more fumes to hasten the death of the planet			0
new roads should always be an option of last resort			0

roads minister @entity0 said new roads must pass ' beauty test '
*homeowners* and campaigners to be given power to help design roads
wants roads to look more ' beautiful ' rather than ' brutal , crass and ugly '
government is looking to build £ 15billion of new roads by the year 2020
