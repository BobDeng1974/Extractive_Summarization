but it has been a case of the calm before the storm today with much of the country basking in the warm conditions and clear skies - and some stunning sunsets across parts of the @entity14			1
the spectacular summery weather is set to come to a dramatic end , however , with forecasters predicting that dismal conditions will settle in over the next few days			0
despite the settled weather in the last few dayts , the @entity42 has said that downpours over the next few days could lead to surface water flooding up to 60mm of rain could fall in a matter of hours while severe gales of up to 70mph are set to batter parts of the north with temperatures plunging by @entity53			1
the grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest september across the @entity0 since records began in 1910			1
it is also likely to finish in the top five warmest septembers			0

the grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest september across the @entity0 since records began in 1910 with the sun shinging and beneath clear blue skies , a man enjoys the fine weather as he walks his dog along the beach in @entity82 , @entity83 despite the dire weather forecast , these four girls found it warm enough today to paddle in the sea at the beach in @entity82 , @entity83 fine day for a walk : the surface of the water sparkles in the october sun today as a man walks his dog along the shore at @entity82 the @entity99 's assessment said : ' although such wind speeds are not unusual across these areas of @entity60 , the contrast with the recent quiet weather means that a few minor impacts may occur			1
' a yellow warning for rain was also issued with ' heavy and persistent ' downpours predicted in parts of southern @entity60 , @entity107 , northern @entity108 and @entity109 from friday afternoon until saturday morning			2
forecasters said between 20mm ( 0.8in ) and 40mm ( 1.6in ) could fall ' quite widely ' across the warning area , while some places could see more than 60mm ( 2.4in ) with much of the rain falling within a few hours			1
making a splash : a ' super-pod ' of more than a thousand dolphins was spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young experts at @entity120 counted the mass off the @entity123 coast in the @entity124			0
they say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under - estimate as they are impossible to keep track of sailing volunteers on the boat ' @entity130 ' were surrounded for nearly three hours by ' wall to wall ' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch the @entity42 said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding , saying : ' the public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding			0
' it said the high pressure which settled over @entity0 and protected it from @entity144 depressions in september is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with october			2
drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding			0
a man heads out early to the banks o the @entity26 in @entity153 for some fishing			0
rain is set to sweep in over the @entity14 and @entity156 tomorrow morning a team of rowers head out for an early morning row on the @entity26 while a thin blanket of mist covers the trees in the back ground			1
the calm scenes are set to come to an end when an @entity144 front moves in across @entity0 enjoy it while it lasts : temperatures across @entity0 have remained above average for the beginning of october - but the mercury could plummet by @entity53 in some parts with the glorious conditions expected to come to an end tomorrow forecasters say the high pressure that settled over @entity0 for much of september is finally moving away and wetter and cooler conditions are set to return temperatures could take a plunge in the next few days with forecasters predicting a return to conditions more in keeping with average october weather @entity186 rowers take a breather during an early morning practice session on the @entity26			1
the scene is a sharp contrast to the weather predicted over the next few days a cyclist is pictured riding along the banks of the @entity26 in @entity153 this morning			0
temperatures topped @entity195 in some parts of @entity0 today the sun shines through the trees along the banks of the @entity26 as two women enjoy a morning row			1
@entity202 weather is set to sweep in from tonight @entity203 , head of the @entity205 's flood rescue team , said : ' it 's a case of " change of month , change of weather "			2
' after precious little rain in september , autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas			2
' while river catchments may well be able to take this volume of water after the very dry september , a lot may fall within 12 to 24 hours , so flash flooding is likely to be the main issue for drivers in the affected areas			0
dark clouds gather from the coast off @entity223 , @entity224 this afternoon with @entity60 's @entity24 looking over for the time being after severe winds and rain battered much of the north last night and into this morning @entity60 and northern @entity108 is expected to see winds gusting up to 70mph as the fine spell of weather finally comes to an end ' be wary of places where water may accumulate ; for instance , dips in the road and under bridges			2
' in dark , wet conditions , it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that 's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it 's too late			0
' tomorrow evening 's rush hour could be particularly affected , so allow a bit more time if you 're heading away for the weekend , and check your car 's lights and wiper blades			0
