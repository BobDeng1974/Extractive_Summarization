he praised the actor for making the film what he calls a cautionary tale rather than glorifying the excessive behavior , as many critics have claimed the film does			0
' originally when @entity10 saw this project , he wanted to get it on screen – and he said this publicly – because it represented the mistakes that i made , and the attitude i had at the time , represents a lot of what went really wrong ultimately , many years later with @entity38 , ' he told @entity50			1
' it was important to him , and i think that - what impressed @entity10 , i think about my new life so much , is he saw me make this really radical turn , and i think that moved him			1
and i was really proud and shocked that he did that			0
' according to @entity9 , he and his associates at the time did n't lose their souls all at once - the decline happened bit by bit			1
turn around : the man , right , who is played by @entity10 in the @entity12 - nominated film , described his life and the movie in the interview with @entity68 , left ' what happens when you get to this section of @entity38 is it 's very easy to rationalize everything you do one action at a time and then it goes further and further , ' he said			1

' i had come to terms with my old life			2
i wrote this book , and that was like a cathartic experience for me			0
but to see it on film like that , with someone that did such a good job , i literally , i felt myself sweating at certain points , when some of the cocaine was being snorted			0
i got almost sympathetic reactions to it			0
' @entity9 then saw the movie again with his 18 - year - old son and his ex-wife , who he is shown punching in the stomach in the movie - something he claims did n't happen in real life			1
hard to watch : @entity9 attended ' @entity113 of @entity38 ' film premiere in december with his partner certain larger - than - life things that did take place , however , include a scene where a woman shaves her head for $ 10,000 , which she used to pay for breast implants , and another where stock brokers are throwing a dwarf at a dart board in the office			1
@entity9 's pal really did eat a live goldfish and there was a ' sex - free zone ' in the promiscuous workplace			1
' it started with the elevator , someone christened the elevator early on , ' he explained			0

' i ca n't say it on tv			0
it was an act of sexual depravity that made even me speechless , ' he said			0
' it happened in front of a crowd of 100 people , there were 50 prostitutes there and they said it was the most depraved thing they ever saw			1
' @entity9 told @entity50 his lowest moment though was when his family fell apart			1
hard : some moments were hard to watch in @entity84 's three hour epic , pictured , @entity9 confessed ' my marriage unwound and the thought of losing my children was the bottom , ' he said			1
thankfully , his kids were young enough when he quit his addictions that they only know him as the man he is today , he said			2
' i was an amazing father and i was proud of that			0
i got sober when my daughter was 3 and my son was 1 , ' he said			0
he added that his parents never judged him and always showed him unconditional support despite his criminal behavior			2
when @entity50 noted that if @entity9 had stayed legitimate , the hardworking salesman would have been worth a fortune today , he responded : ' that 's the shame of it all			1
the biggest mistake i made was not delaying my gratification , i would have been worth $ 10 - 20 billion now			0
' @entity9 reportedly owed some $ 110 million to the victims of his scam			1
but he said he 's paid back around $ 12 million of his debt and is giving 100 per cent of cash made from the book sales and the movie to the compensation fund			1
' i think it 'll be many , many millions of dollars and i 'm really happy about that , ' he told @entity50			1
caution : he praised @entity10 , pictured in the movie , for making the film what he calls a cautionary tale rather than glorifying the excessive behavior , as many critics have claimed the film does according to @entity202 , the film based upon his life has already grossed more than $ 91 million since opening a month ago			1

but @entity9 said he had n't met with any of his victims			2
' i have not ... no one has sought me out , ' he said			0
' what i 'm doing here , by turning over 100 percent of the profits , is probably the most genuine thing i can do			2
honestly i feel terrible about what happened			0
you asked if i had shame : back then , yes			0
now , no. i 'm not going to live my life in shame			0
i think that 's a toxic emotion			0
' i live with remorse , and that means i go out and do things actively to make up for the wrongs that i committed in the past			0
' but the former @entity233 said he was open to meeting some of the people he swindled in a bid to make amends .			0
