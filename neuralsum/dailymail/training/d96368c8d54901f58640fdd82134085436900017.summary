these monsters of the deep were captured on camera dead or alive in one photographer 's attempt to catalogue what lies beneath the surface of our oceans			1
@entity10 photographer @entity9 produced the series of detailed images - of mainly dead creatures - to give a glimpse into our planet 's largest but least explored habitat			1
disheartened that scientists know more about our moon and the other planets in our solar system than what lies at the bottom of our oceans , mr @entity9 embarked on the challenging project to help bring the unknown to life			2
a viper fish : @entity10 photographer @entity9 produced this series of detailed images - of mainly dead creatures - to give a glimpse into our planet 's largest but least explored habitat a longfin dragonfish : known as @entity35 , the @entity34 is found in the @entity36 down to depths of 6,600 ft the species typically grows to a length of 13.5in a snipe eel : this family of eels are found in every ocean , mostly at depths of 300 - 600m but sometimes as deep as 4000m			1
adults may reach 30 - 60in in length , yet they weigh only a few ounces to a pound @entity48 is a @entity36 dragonfish , showing the long beard - like appendage that earned the creature its name			2
right is a larval snipe eel , a juvenile specimen of the species pictured above a squat lobster : these dorsoventrally flattened crustaceans have long tails which are held curled beneath the thorax			0
found in oceans worldwide , they occur from near the surface to deep sea hydrothermal vents a sabretooth : these small , fierce - looking deep - sea fish , named for their oversized , recurved teeth , similar to those of sabre - toothed cats , are found in tropical to subtropical parts of the @entity72 , @entity73 , and @entity36 the mysterious creatures were shot at @entity75 and @entity10 laboratories in @entity77 , and on unmanned deep sea deployments off the coast of the @entity80			1
he said : ' as of today , we 've only explored about 5 percent of deep ocean habitats , and if their was ever a final frontier , the deep ocean is it			1
imagine what other animals live there			0
' most of my thoughts during shooting were questions like : " what the hell am i doing photographing this weird stuff ? nobody is going to get it			0
' but at the same time , as the images were coming into view , i felt excited and inspired			1
these creatures have a strange beauty and i felt privileged being able to work with and learn about them			1
' a grunt sculpin : it is native to temperate coastal waters of the @entity36 , from @entity106 to @entity107 and south to @entity77 where it inhabits tide pools , rocky areas , and sandy bottoms at depths of up to 165m a rat fish : also known as @entity114 , this fish lives in depths of 50 @entity117 in the eastern - @entity72 , from west - @entity118 up to @entity119			0
it wields a poisonous spike on the dorsal fin that can cause a lot of pain @entity48 is a sea spider , of which there are over 1,300 known species , ranging in size from 0.039in to over 35in			0
right is a deep - sea skate , common below 1,000m in the @entity36 and often caught in deepwater trawls and traps a smooth hound shark : the smooth - hounds are a genus , @entity135 , of sharks in the family @entity137			0
the genus name comes from the @entity140 for weasel			0
they can grow up to 5ft 3in long and weigh more than 29 lb ' these creatures have a strange beauty ' : disheartened that scientists know more about our moon than the bottom of the oceans , mr @entity9 embarked on the challenging project to help bring the unknown to life mr @entity9 came up with the idea by chance while visiting an event promoting non-profit organisations , where his wife showed him a picture she took of a jar of preserved krill			1
' i thought , what a great idea , ' he said			0
' why not study sets of animals that ca n't be easily observed in nature ? ' admittedly , the krill in the jar were dead and preserved and yes most people might find it disgusting , or weird at best			2
' but i was taken by the textures , patterns , tones and shapes of the tiny shrimps as they sat suspended in their preserving fluid			0
' most of the alien - like fish , whether dead or alive , were shot against black or white backgrounds in an aquarium lit by studio strobe flashes .			2
