a @entity1 community has voiced objection to plans of a forensic research ' body farm ' in which human bodies will be left in @entity1 elements for extended periods of time			2
@entity10 , which would be located in @entity11 , is a joint project between the @entity13 and the @entity14			1
it has the potential to offer forensic scientists and law - enforcement investigators a chance to see what happens to the bodies when they are left in @entity1 elements			2
five to ten bodies from @entity23 would be buried or placed on two acres of the @entity24 in @entity11 , which is a 230 - acre plot of land bordered by a landfill and county property			1
@entity41 commissioner @entity40 has taken a stand against the facility , while state attorney general @entity44 and @entity41 sheriff @entity45 have supported the project			1
' just the reputation alone of having a quote ' body farm ' in your community could have a drastic impact , ' @entity40 told @entity53			0
' our perception has always been in @entity58 that we get , for lack of a better term , the junk that no one else wants			0
' other areas in the training center are used to teach deputies how to safely drive during chases , shoot a gun and subdue airplane hostage takers , according to the @entity67			0
@entity68 , associate professor of anthropology at @entity23 , said that this research could potentially help solve the more than 500 cold cases in @entity41 , @entity72 and @entity74 counties @entity41 commissioner @entity40 has taken a stand against the facility , fearing strong odors and the reputation it could bring to his community the nearest houses are about half a mile away from the site , and officials from the sheriff 's office said the bodies would be surrounded by a seven - foot fence , so no decomposing bodies would be visible to passersby or from houses			1
a deputy who lives at the site would provide 24 - hour security for the bodies			0
but residents of @entity11 are still reluctant to support the project			1
some fear that unwanted animals might happen upon the site , including coyotes , panthers and other predators			1
resident @entity103 , whose five acres of land border the training facility , fears the bodies might bring with them an unpleasant smell			2
' you say you can contain the smell , but what 's it going to do when the heat gets up and the wind starts blowing and we 're sitting on our porch swing we 've worked hard to have in our retirement and those bodies get rancid ? ' @entity103 told the @entity117			0
' i can smell the dump 10 miles away			0
' as of now , there is no timeline for the project , which has been in the works for more than a year , though it was just announced to residents a few weeks ago			2
@entity68 , associate professor of anthropology at @entity23 , said that there are more than 500 cold cases in @entity41 , @entity72 and @entity74 counties , and the facility could help change that			1
@entity68 said that no taxpayer money would be used to fund the project , but rather grants and donations would be used			1
she added that there would be no odor or affect on the soil and water in the area ' improving on our current methods helps solve long - term open cases and that 's what this is ultimately about , ' @entity68 told the @entity67			1
' it 's a tremendous gift to give these remains back to a family			0
' she added that the body farm would not draw taxpayer money and would n't contaminate soil or water or create an odor			0
it would operate solely on donations and grant funding			0
@entity40 told the @entity157 that a dialogue had not been engaged with ' any local officials ' , though @entity68 said she 's been working with the @entity161 's office since march 2014			2
' how in the world would someone think people are going to react when they hear that a ' body farm ' might be coming into the community ? this is an ivory tower academia mind - set at its finest , ' @entity40 said .			0

@entity10 would be located in @entity11 in @entity41
it is a joint project between the @entity172 and the @entity14
residents fear it will bring unwanted predators and a strong odor to area
@entity23 associate professor @entity68 said the project could help investigators solve cold cases and other crimes
there are more than 500 cold cases in @entity41 , @entity72 and @entity74 counties - areas close to the research facility
