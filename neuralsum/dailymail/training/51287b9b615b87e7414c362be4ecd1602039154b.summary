it is made up of 631 branches @entity6 was forced to sell off by the @entity25 as a condition of its £ 20billion bail out by taxpayers during the financial crisis			2
a quarter of the shares will be sold initially , with the offer open to ordinary retail investors as well as institutional investors such as pension funds			1
to entice retail investors they will be offered one free ‘ loyalty ’ share for every 20 they buy , as long as they hang on to them for at least a year			1
@entity6 wants to prevent savers from trying to make a quick profit by cashing in their shares early - as happened with the float of @entity46 last october			1
but investors will have to wait until 2017 before tsb is in a position to hand out dividends			2
retail investors will only be allowed to buy a fifth of the shares on offer , with the remainder allocated to institutional investors			2
@entity6 will also foot the bill for any mis - selling that occurred under its watch , including payment protection insurance which has cost the bank almost £ 10billion so far			1
the announcement comes just days after over- 50s cruise and finance firm @entity62 launched a £ 2.1billion float on the stockmarket			0
half of the shares were bought by retail investors , but the float was considered a flop as the shares were sold on the cheap			2
chief executive @entity17 ( above ) said @entity10 would be different from other scandal - hit lenders on the @entity21 yesterday chief executive @entity17 launched an appeal to customers and potential investors , promising that @entity10 would be different from the other scandal - hit lenders on the @entity21			0

’ he added : ‘ you can never say never			0
but i ’m doing everything in my power to minimise the likelihood that there will be a new mis - selling scandal at @entity10			0
’ offloading the branches has proved a major headache for @entity6 , with the co-op pulling out of a £ 750million deal to buy the branches last april			0
@entity6 has run up a £ 1.6billion bill to create a separate lender , which it called @entity10 – resurrecting a brand which disappeared when @entity6 merged with @entity10 in 1995			0
launched in september , @entity10 has 4.5million customers - most of whom were transferred from @entity101 and @entity102			0
@entity10 is the seventh biggest bank on the @entity21 , but is planning to boost its share of the market and expand its network of branches			0
@entity6 has to sell off the rest of @entity10 by the @entity25 deadline which falls at the end of next year			1
the first sell off next month will also clear the way for the government to sell off a third tranche of taxpayers ’ stake in @entity6 in the @entity116			1
it is expected to finally open up the offer to retail investors , having raised £ 7.4billion from selling two tranches of shares to institutional investors			0
