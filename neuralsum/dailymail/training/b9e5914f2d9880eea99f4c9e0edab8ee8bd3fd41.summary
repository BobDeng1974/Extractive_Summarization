it ’s bad enough checking your partner ’s phone when they leave the room , or taking a peek at their @entity8 page , yet a new app takes this level of snooping not just a step further , but a giant leap forward			2
the @entity14 app works on select smartphones including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 and can be used to gain access to an unprecedented level of personal information			1
it records phone calls , tracks a person ’s location , lets users remotely read texts , @entity30 , @entity8 and @entity31 messages , view browsing history and even see how much battery the phone has left			1
the app also lets them read text messages , emails , @entity30 chats , @entity8 messages and more three fifths of men in relationships in the @entity49 claim to have snooped for ' incriminating messages or activity ' , compared to a third of women , according to recent research by mobilephonechecker.co.uk			1
when asked to reveal if they had ever looked through a current or ex-partner ’s mobile phone without their knowledge , 62 per cent of the men taking part and just 34 per cent of female respondents admitted that they had done so			0
when asked for the motivations behind wanting to check up on their partner , the majority ( 89 per cent ) admitted they had done so to see if their partner had been talking to anyone else in a romantic or sexual context , indicating signs of infidelity			0
furthermore , 52 per cent of those asked admitted that they knew the passcode or password needed to access their partner ’s phone in order to do this			0
according to @entity83 - based @entity14 ’s website the app is designed for ' monitoring your children , employees or others on a smartphone or mobile device ’			2
however , it adds the person doing the spying must own the device being tracked , or the person being tracked must give their permission			2
to use the app , spies must pay a monthly fee that starts at £ 24.99 for a limited range of features , up to £ 44.99 for access to them all			1
spies can also use the app to view videos and photos stored on a device , see the phone owner 's list of applications and software updates , open their calendar , notes and tasks , and even get hold of the phone ’s unique imei number			2
they can additionally remotely lock or wipe a device , block websites and calls from certain contacts as well as record the person ’s surroundings			2
people wanting to use the app do need to physically install it onto the phone they wish to track , yet once installed @entity14 promises the app is 100 per cent undetectable			1
the app also tracks a person 's location and plots where they 've been on a map , pictured , that can be accessed from an online dashboard remotely			2
@entity138 additionally stores browsing history and can even tell a spy how much battery is left on the device this is because the app runs it what the company calls ‘ stealth mode ’ and does n’t appear in the phone owner ’s apps list			1
it works in a similar way to encryption lockers that are designed to be hidden deliberately and can only be found by the installer			0
these apps , however , are designed to protect information and privacy			0
subscribers can choose to sync the data automatically , only over @entity160 , or manually and if automatic sync is selected the data is updated every 30 minutes			1
users can then track this information from anywhere by signing into an online account and viewing it all on a dashboard			1
the dashboard produces charts that show which apps have been used and how often , while the person ’s location is plotted on to a map			0
‘ we do have quite a large portion of our customers who use @entity178 specifically to catch a cheating spouse , " @entity181 ’s @entity180 told @entity183 22 news			0
but added ‘ we do ask our users to make sure they 've got their monitored partners consent			0
’ according to @entity14 the app works on @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity188 , however , it will only work on jailbroken @entity190 devices and does n’t work with @entity190			1
@entity17 phones , similarly , need to be rooted			2
to use the app , spies must pay a monthly fee that starts at £ 24.99 for a limited range of features including access to videos , photos and data stored on the device			1
for £ 44.99 a month , subscribers also get access to @entity30 messages , pictured , @entity8 chats and other in - app content subscribers can install the app on multiple devices to track different children in a family , for example , or employees			1
commenting on the app , @entity213 , director of @entity214 , told @entity216 : ' the fact companies are selling extremely intrusive spyware so brazenly begs the question if we are properly protecting people from snooping by their boss , parents or indeed anyone who has enough time to install the app on their phone			0
' this is the kind of technology you 'd expect the security services to be using , not for sale with the click of a mouse			0
you do n’t teach kids to think about their privacy by secretly listening to their calls or reading their emails , nor do you create a productive working environment by routinely snooping on your employees			0
' buried in the small print is the fact it is illegal to monitor someone ’s phone without notifying them , but the risks of abuse are only too clear and this kind of technology needs to be much more tightly regulated			0
