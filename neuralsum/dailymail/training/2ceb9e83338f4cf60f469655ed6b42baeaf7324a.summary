i got married to my beautiful girlfriend @entity1 in @entity2 last week and it was a wonderful experience			1
i was n't sure if i would feel anxious about the occasion , but it was such a pleasure			0
there was only a small group of friends and family , it was quite intimate – and we all went to a beach restaurant after the ceremony and we continued the celebrations there			1
it was an awesome day , very emotional and it just felt right			0
only 48 hours later , @entity17 then faced @entity18 in the @entity20 final			1
i watched the game with my family at my parents ' house in @entity2			1
in the end , the @entity17 did it when @entity35 scored with just seven minutes of extra-time remaining			1
it was so , so awesome			0
i went crazy in the apartment when we scored and it was a great experience , one that i will always remember			2
it was well deserved because @entity17 were the best team at the tournament			1
i came home to @entity17 on tuesday so i followed their celebrations with the bus going through @entity49 ; there were some great pictures and great energy			1
the whole team were fantastic throughout the tournament			2
some players were better in some matches and some in other games , so everyone contributed			0
we 've done it : @entity25 celebrates @entity17 's @entity20 triumph over @entity18			1
@entity17 won 1 - 0 in extra-time on wednesday , it was announced that i 've agreed a new contract with @entity27 , and i am very proud to have signed a new deal with , for me , the most special team in @entity67			1
i am a @entity17 driver at a @entity17 team , and i am so proud to continue the history of the @entity71			1
it is great that we are dominating the sport , we are the best team , and i am grateful for the trust that @entity76 , @entity77 and everyone else have shown in me			2
the discussions about my new deal started a long time ago because most of us had great interest in continuing what has been a successful relationship			2
the process was an on - going one , but it was always relaxed and the time had come to solidify and announce the deal			1
this is the place where i want to be			0
i feel very much at home here , and they have shown a lot of faith and respect in me and it is a great collaboration , so i am looking forward to many more successful years with the team			2
i am also enjoying the moment , because is special knowing that if i do a good job at each race i can be on pole and if i do a good job on sunday i will win the grand prix			0
it does n't get better than that			0
on track : it was announced on wednesday that he 29 - year - old had agreed a ' multi-year ' deal with @entity27 @entity107 signs @entity27 extension this week is my second home race – the @entity17 @entity110 – and it would round off an incredible week if i could win on sunday			1
so , that is the mission and i am looking forward to completing it			0
i am also looking forward to receiving the support from the home fans which will be great			0
this race is special because i know so many people are supporting us , and i am in the fortunate position where i have two home races – in @entity2 and @entity120			1
in response to @entity123 ' comments about my nationality , i do n't really read the press , but i got a jist of what he said			0
i am very much laid back about it , and i understand it was a joke from @entity123 rather than something serious			0
i am easy going and i do n't have any problems with such opinions and that is all i really have to say on the matter			0
the atmosphere last time out at the @entity138 @entity110 was amazing			1
the fans were obviously there to support @entity123 , but everybody gave me the respect as well and even i could enjoy what was a brilliant occasion , despite my own personal result			0
unfortunately my gearbox broke during the race and @entity123 went on to win			0
naturally , there was then a lot of interest in whether i would have won the race had i not suffered my first dnf of the season			0
it is impossible to say but let us give the benefit to the guy who was leading			0
i was doing well at the time , so i was pretty confident i could have made it happen and stayed out in front			0
the early part of the race was red flagged for one hour following @entity162 's huge shunt			2
i just tried to chill out ; i also went to see @entity1 and my friends and discuss the re-start with my team			1
on @entity162 's crash , it was certainly a big one , but it is difficult to comment on it			2
there was a bump off the track which he hit and it is difficult to foresee those sort of things so i ca n't really judge whether he could have avoided it or not			0
i saw that his wheel narrowly missed @entity182 's helmet and i am sure we will have to discuss the idea of closed - cockpit racing with the @entity186 at some point in the near future			1
wreck : @entity162 was fortunate to avoid any major injury following his first - lap crash at the @entity138 gp retirement : @entity25 suffered his first dnf of the year at @entity193			2
he leads the championship by four points @entity25 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity198 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity67 mechanics and their families , putting @entity67 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			1
you can follow @entity25 on @entity210 @ nico_rosberg and @entity27 @ @entity211 .			2

i married my partner @entity1 at an intimate ceremony in @entity2 last week
watching @entity17 beat @entity18 in the final was incredible *...* i went crazy
i am proud to have signed a new deal with @entity27 - @entity67 's best team
winning the @entity17 @entity110 would round off an incredible week for me
