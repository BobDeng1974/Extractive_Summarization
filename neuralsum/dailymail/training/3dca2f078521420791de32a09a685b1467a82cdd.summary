dramatic : lifeguards and passersby try to secure the vehicle as waves crash around it what remained : just moments after the children were taken out of the car , it flipped over completely and waves tore through it emergency responders : the good samaritans led the charge but then beach patrol took over ' the children were in the back seat , they were buckled in and were not in distress			1

she drove right toward it , so it 's hard to believe it was an accident			0

good samaritans @entity46 and @entity8 saw the children in distress in the car and ran to help them out
@entity20 's relatives were alarmed on tuesday when she started talking ' about @entity114 and how there were demons in her house '
police pulled her over and did a welfare check but she told them she feared her husband and was going to a domestic violence safe house
they legally had no grounds to keep her and so they let her go
hours later tourists saw her drive *straight* into the water at @entity36
rescuers pulled her three children - ages 3 , 9 , and 10 - from the car
