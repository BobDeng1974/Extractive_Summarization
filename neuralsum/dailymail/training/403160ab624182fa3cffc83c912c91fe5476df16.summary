unlike other continents , the soils and topography of @entity3 prevent almost all of its rain from running off into the ocean , causing dry areas of @entity3 to act like an enormous sponge			1
according to a @entity27 study , the effect caused by the @entity25 weather pattern around @entity3 meant global sea levels fell for 18 months during 2010 and 2011 , bucking the long - term trend of rising sea levels caused by higher temperatures and melting ice sheets			1
the scientists said that as the atmospheric patterns have returned to normal , more rain is falling over the tropical oceans once more and the seas are rising again			2
dr @entity38 , a scientist at the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in the @entity27 said : ' it 's a beautiful illustration of how complicated our climate system is			2
' ' the smallest continent in the world can affect sea level worldwide			0
its influence is so strong that it can temporarily overcome the background trend of rising sea levels that we see with climate change			1
' dr @entity38 said most of the rain that normally falls over land usually travels back to the sea via streams and rivers over months so when there is torrential rain over the land , the effect on the world 's sea levels is almost invisible			2
however , during the @entity25 of 2010 - 11 , which saw the temperature of the eastern @entity14 drop and more rainfall over land then normal , global sea levels dropped by 0.3 inches for around 18 months			1

according to a @entity27 study , the effect caused by the @entity25 weather pattern around @entity3 meant global sea levels fell for 18 months during 2010 and 2011 the fall goes against the larger trend of sea levels rising by around 0.1 inch per year since 1993 , which is believed to be caused by melting glaciers and ice sheets as well as water temperatures warming up , which are linked to global warming			1
however , since 2011 and the end of @entity25 , sea levels have risen faster than before at around 0.4 inches per year			0
the research , published in @entity84 , links the fall in sea levels to more water storage on land , which occurred at the same time as @entity25			0
dr @entity38 noted there have been other @entity25 events when scientists did not observe a drop in sea levels as dramatic as in 2010 - 11			2
by the time this second image was taken in march 26 , 2011 , a huge amount of rain had fallen across @entity3 instead of in the ocean			0
the scientists said that as the atmospheric patterns have returned to normal , more rain is falling over the tropical oceans once more and the seas are rising again in a bid to explain the phenomenon , the scientists found @entity25 coincided with two other weather patterns that effectively funneled the water over @entity3 's land mass , where it seldom rains			1
the @entity108 weather pattern , which carried atmospheric moisture across the ocean from the west , met the easterly moving moisture from @entity25			0
a third pattern called the @entity114 then caused the rain to fall on the huge continent			0
dr @entity38 told @entity117 : ' you have this collision of transports in the @entity14 and then southward into @entity3 — so a big funnel of tropical moisture into @entity3 — and that led to one of the wettest years on record in @entity3 , if not the wettest			0
' almost 1ft of rain fell over @entity3 during the 18 month period in 2010 - 11 , which was effectively trapped in the @entity127 ( pictured ) with nowhere to go			1
dr @entity38 said only in @entity3 could the atmosphere carry such heavy tropical rains to such a large area , only to have those rains fail to make their way to the ocean almost one foot of rain fell over @entity3 during the period and the rain was effectively trapped in the @entity127 - the dry , interior of the continent - with nowhere to go			1
dr @entity38 said : ' no other continent has this combination of atmospheric set - up and topography			0
only in @entity3 could the atmosphere carry such heavy tropical rains to such a large area , only to have those rains fail to make their way to the ocean			0
' much of the water collected in the @entity150 , which has been likened to a massive inland sea in the east of the country , while most of the rest of the water was absorbed by the dry soil of the @entity157			0
it is not known whether this strange occurrence will happen more regularly as earth warms up and scientists are not sure how global warming could effect the @entity164 and @entity25 cycle			2
dr @entity38 believes the event if partly due to climate change , but also partly natural as he claims it was a ' serendipitous interaction ' of weather patterns that caused global sea levels to temporarily fall .			1

@entity27 scientists said a combination of weather patterns over the @entity13 and @entity14 oceans funneled rain over @entity3
for an 18 - month period the oceans dropped by about 7 *millimeters* bucking the trend of rising sea levels said to be caused by global warming
a study by @entity39 said the soils and topography of @entity3 prevented rain running into the ocean , causing dry areas to act like an enormous sponge
