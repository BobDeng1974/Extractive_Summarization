@entity0 in the height of summer with children			1
would you buy that for a dollar ? precisely			2
but take your crew 90 minutes north of the @entity7 to @entity8 in the heart of the @entity10 and you ’ll not regret it for a second			1
it gets its name from the surrounding @entity16 , on the fringes of the monumental @entity18 , a vast cliff band that runs down through @entity20 to @entity21			2
it is astonishing to find such wilderness so close to the city			0
the hotel is a faux - gothic @entity27 castle and may look too faux to @entity29 eyes , but the lake , gardens and trails are a vast adventure playground for all ages			1
a world away : the faux - gothic @entity27 castle hotel @entity8 enjoys a spectacular location perfect : @entity38 found the hotel , lake , gardens and trails to be an adventure playground for his young family one afternoon , we check our two girls into the kids ’ club and climb up the @entity50 trail ( one of eight epic scrambles ) to @entity53 on the high bluff above the lake			1
we clamber over boulders , up timber ladders and squeeze through tiny gaps in the cliff band			0
the 360 - degree views are inspirational			2
the kids ’ club is the best we have experienced			0
our girls make paper bag whales , cork puppets and chalk drawings , dress up and sing songs , go on pony and boat rides			0
we use the club as a drop - in once or twice a day , using our free time to explore the 5,000 acres of hotel grounds and the surrounding preserve			1
water water everywhere : the hotel sits on the banks of @entity76 in @entity77 's @entity10 another afternoon , we check in to the spa ; another morning , we ride @entity79 on horseback as turkey vultures , red - tailed hawks and bald eagles soar overhead			1
in between , we have a ball with the children			0
we take them out on the lake in pedalos , and walk the lakeside path following a baby deer			0
on the opposite side of the lake , a path down from the cliff leads to a sandy beach and swimming area			0
high on the cliff above is the @entity99 restaurant , a wonderful open - air grill that serves lunch and lobster cook - outs			1
rooms are divided between the four sections of the hotel , some traditional , some contemporary			2
all are comfortable , a good size and most come with private balconies			0
splash : guests of the hotel can enjoy a day on the lake in canoes , one of many available outdoor activities the hotel began life as a ten - room drinking inn			1
then , 145 years ago , two quaker twins , @entity122 and @entity123 , fell in love with its setting and bought it to use as a teetotal retreat for the great and good			1
it was full from their first season , has played host to five @entity132 presidents and is still owned and run by the @entity123 family			2
but grown - ups will be pleased to know the ban on alcohol has long passed			2
we raise a glass to simple pleasures			0
@entity140 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity141 from £ 439 return			0
