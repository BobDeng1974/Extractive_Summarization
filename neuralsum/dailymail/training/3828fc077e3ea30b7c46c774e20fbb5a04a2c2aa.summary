while most @entity2 do all they can to avoid rats lurking in subway stops and city alleyways , a group of students is actively searching them out			2
two teams from @entity7 have been traipsing across @entity2 to catch rats for research - in the hopes of finding out how the species has evolved differently across the island of @entity13			1
photojournalist @entity14 , who is based on @entity15 , snapped a series of intriguing images showing the students hard at work as they sniffed out the fearsome rodents - before snipping off parts of their tails or feet for tests			1
the black - and - white photo series shows the students heading to far corners of the city or climbing through shrubbery as they put down traps filled with peanut butter , bacon bits and other greasy foods			1
a few days later , they return to collect them and carry out their tests			0
@entity37 : @entity7 student @entity38 measures a rat as part of a project to determine if rats in different parts of @entity2 display different genetic traits			1
the project began in 2013 and the small team has been collecting samples across the city ever since search : another student , @entity50 , searches for traps , which the team has so far laid across @entity53 and @entity54 study : sample can be any part that contains dna , but is most often taken from the tail or the foot , photographer @entity14 explained the students believe that there are genetic differences in rats that are specific to their area in the city , that is , rats in downtown @entity13 could be genetically different from those in the @entity70			1
they have noticed , perhaps unsurprisingly , that well - kept areas of the city do not have many rats - such as @entity53 - whereas well - populated areas , including playgrounds , are overrun with the rodents			2
' i thought it was ironic , how rat populations relate to socioeconomics , ' @entity14 told @entity81 in an earlier interview			0
the duo 's project started in 2013 and will continue for at least two years			0
so far , they have set traps and collected samples in @entity53 and @entity54 , which is the northern-most part of @entity13 , and next year they will be searching other parts of the city , including @entity91			1
' our research seeks to understand how rats inhabit this environment , ' student @entity38 explained to @entity97			0
' what makes them more or less successful , and how they travel through a dense urban matrix like @entity13			0
' their tests have so far found ' there 's a pattern of evolution ' , @entity81 reported			0
ongoing search : the team plans to set more traps next year in parts of the city , including @entity91 strange sight : @entity14 said he was inspired to capture the project because he wanted to look at a part of the city he had not seen before findings : the team believes the rats could have different genetics depending on where they are found in the city for @entity14 , the strange subject choice was appealing			1
' i wanted to focus on a project in the city that i had n't seen before , ' he said			2
in other photographs , shared on his website , @entity14 snapped another rat catcher team appropriately named ' @entity128 ' , which stands for @entity130 's @entity129			0
the team , led by @entity130 , goes out at night with between four and ten dogs to catch as many as 20 rats in areas of the city			2
they train the dogs , mostly terriers , by allowing them to chew on rats as pups , or by simply taking them on searches until they show their genetic leaning towards hunting			0
the @entity7 students are now working with @entity128 to collect samples for their study			1
the students found that the rat hunters were a far more efficient way of helping them find the rodents , @entity97 reported			0
the team says they have the support of nearby residents - and police even point them in the right direction for their next hunt			0
killed : a dead rat can be seen inside a trap after being poisoned with @entity162 , a chloroform - like substance that the scientists use to kill rats that are still alive in the traps			2
they capture the rats by putting peanut butter or bacon bits inside the traps log : a book shows the researchers ' log of rat numbers ; they also get rats with the help of a city rat hunting society hopeful : the project , which will continue throughout next year , could show how rats have evolved within the island of @entity13			1

@entity7 students are capturing rats across the city in the hopes of finding out how the species has evolved differently across the island of @entity13
photojournalist @entity14 followed the students as they *delved* into parks or far corners of the city to lay the traps and collect them to carry out tests
they also get help from a rat - hunting society that catches as many as 20 rodents a night with their dogs
@entity14 said he was intrigued by the project because he wanted to focus on a part of the city he *'d* not seen before
