@entity1 winger @entity0 has lost his appeal against a seven - match ban for using racist language			1
a @entity6 appeal tribunal threw out the appeal after the on - loan @entity9 winger was earlier banned over an incident involving @entity14 full - back @entity12			1
the @entity6 has published the report of both panels who examined the case			2
@entity1 's @entity0 ( right ) was handed a seven - match ban for racially abusing @entity14 's @entity12 ( left ) in a match in september and he has now had his appeal rejected by the @entity6 @entity1 manager @entity22 had earlier indicated the club would challenge the decision further if it was upheld			1
the report of the original panel hearing stated that @entity12 had accused @entity0 of saying : ' do n't touch me you black c * * * ' when the @entity14 defender put his arm across the @entity1 player moments after fouling him			1
@entity0 denied saying the offensive words and no - one else heard them but the panel heard that @entity12 quickly told his captain , @entity37 , referee @entity38 , and manager @entity39			1
the report described @entity12 as an ' impressive witness '			2
@entity43 and @entity1 assistant manager @entity42 ( left ) leave @entity44 after the original hearing it added : ' he gave his evidence in a careful and measured manner			2
he gave clear and unequivocal evidence that mr @entity0 had used the language complained of and that it had been targeted at him			0
' however , the panel stated they were unable to accept the @entity52 as ' either credible or reliable ' on the central issue of the case			2
the report continued : ' his evidence on his understanding of the language said to have been used , was particularly unsatisfactory			0
' in chief examination his evidence was to the effect that he did not know what the word ' c * * * ' meant			0
' on cross examination he explained that he had heard the term in his time at @entity9 but did not know what it meant			0
he then accepted that he was aware that it was a term of abuse			0
@entity0 ( centre ) sits with @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 on the bench against @entity75 ' the impression was of a witness giving a less than a full account of his actual understanding ; and seemed to the tribunal to be an inherently improbable account			0
' @entity1 , who were earlier issued with a @entity84 charge over alleged ' crowd disturbances ' during their @entity87 defeat by @entity75 last week , said they were ' extremely disappointed ' by the outcome and vowed to take up the case with the governing body			0
a club statement read : ' we do not consider that any player should be found guilty of such a grave offence on the basis of the evidence presented in this case			1
' @entity1 will be approaching the @entity6 to seek to address this issue			1
the winger heads through @entity101 airport ahead of @entity1 's trip to @entity103 ' we would like to make it clear that at no stage was it ever suggested that @entity12 had made any false allegations			1
however , @entity0 's position consistently has been that he did not say the words that were alleged to have been said and that he is not a racist			0
' @entity1 has enjoyed an excellent relationship with @entity14 and this , of course , will continue			1
' as we have said many times before , racism has no place in football and as a club which has been open to all ever since its formation in 1888 , @entity1 abhors racism of any kind			0
' clearly , @entity0 continues to have our full support			0
' @entity1 will face another disciplinary hearing on february 19 when @entity84 's control , ethics and disciplinary body meets to discuss the incident in @entity128 , which saw a flare lit in the visiting end			2
