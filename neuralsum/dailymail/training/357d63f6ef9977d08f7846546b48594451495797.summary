by @entity0 with her bulging muscles and intense fitness regime , @entity1 is n't your average teenager			1
the 19 - year - old is a bodybuilder and has swapped mooning over one direction for six meals a day , five workouts a week and an impressive 10st 3lb physique			1
and it would appear that the teenager 's dedication has paid off , after she took home a gold medal in the @entity17 [ @entity18 and @entity19 ] @entity20 this summer			1
' my mum and dad are really into keeping fit , so there were always weights and stuff lying around the house when i was younger			2
' i was about 17 when i decided i wanted to take up bodybuilding properly , although i was already quite stacked by then			2
' i knew it was an unusual thing for a girl my age to want to do - most girls want to be thin and dainty - but i really love it			0
' the teen , who is a statuesque 5ft 7in tall , revealed that her powerful frame had divided opinions among her friends , family and the opposite sex			0
' my parents and friends are really proud of me and think i look great , but my brother is the total opposite - he does n’t get the whole bodybuilding thing at all , ' she said			0
' i do n’t have a boyfriend at the moment , but i do n’t think my unusual hobby will put all boys off			0
yes , some are a bit intimidated by my muscles , but others like them - i think it ’s an acquired taste			2
' tough : @entity1 's routine includes six meals a day and intense workouts five days a week bodybuilder : @entity1 follows in the footsteps of model - turned - athlete @entity63 , who also competes but while @entity1 is used to showing off her toned physique in a string bikini onstage , she is keen to cover up in everyday life			1
' although bodybuilding has really helped my self - esteem , i tend to cover myself up when i ’m out and about , ' she said ' if i do n’t , people stare at me - especially at my arms and shoulders			0
i get a lot of compliments for my physique , but i get a lot of insults too - quite a few people have said nasty things about me in the past			0
' but @entity1 , who trains at professional bodybuilder @entity80 ' @entity83 ’s @entity82 in @entity84 , has n’t let the insults get her down and has upped her regime ahead of the @entity87 , which are due to take place in @entity89 in october			1
' i was delighted to qualify for the championships , but i am having to be very careful with what i eat , ” she added			2
see @entity93 's tips online in full here and more videos on @entity96 criticism : @entity1 prefers to cover up when out and about as people are sometimes rude about her looks ' i have the same sort of stuff - rice , turkey and eggs - six times a day and ca n’t go out for any nice meals with my family and friends			1
' i get hungry every few hours anyway , so it ’s not too bad , but it does make living a normal teenage life quite difficult			0
' the determined athlete , who recently graduated from @entity112 , said she dreams of becoming a pro bodybuilder with the @entity114 ( @entity114 )			1
' i really enjoy competing and would love to be a pro one day , ' she said			2
' i get quite scared before stepping on to the stage , but i ’m alright once i ’m up there			0
' i ’ve also made a lot of like - minded friends , like @entity119 , through bodybuilding , who keep me going and keep me focused			1
i would quite like to go to university at some point though , so i ’ll just have to see what happens			0

the @entity130 teenager says *reaction* to her muscles is mixed
