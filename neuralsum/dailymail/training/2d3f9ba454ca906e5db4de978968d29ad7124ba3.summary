a former @entity1 soldier who survived weeks of torture at the hands of @entity5 interrogators believes it can be used to prevent terrorists attacks			1
@entity8 believes security services have a ' moral responsibility ' to torture suspects if innocent lives hang in the balance			1
a report released earlier this week revealed that brutal techniques used by @entity17 agents against @entity19 suspects in the wake of the september 11 bombings failed to produce useful intelligence			1

protest : human rights activists in @entity51 demonstrate ' water - boarding ' on a volunteer ( file photo ) the former @entity56 sergeant told @entity57 he ' would n't think twice ' about ' inflicting pain ' on someone if he thought it could prevent an atrocity such as the 2005 @entity63 bombings			1
he said : ' i would deem it a moral responsibility to interrogate , to physically torture him to get the information out			0
' torture is a really blunt instrument but it is an instrument that if it used right can yield results			0
' there will always be legislation to make sure that we do n't do it , but we will do it ... we could moan about tactical interrogation or we could moan about 24 - 28 people getting blown up on a tube			1
it 's a tough call			0
' @entity8 was stripped of his clothing , beaten and held in isolation for three weeks in @entity84			2
he and three of his colleagues were then whipped until they bled @entity5 forces pressed a red - hot spoon into their open wounds the back molars on the left side of his jaw were extracted using pliers			2
he was taken to another detention centre in @entity96 where he was beaten for another three weeks his comments follow calls for a judge - led inquiry into @entity102 involvement in @entity17 torture , following a @entity40 @entity104 which claimed ' abhorrent ' interrogation techniques were used by @entity40 agents			1
@entity107 , @entity108 , admitted some agents had used ' unauthorised methods ' , but insists they gained some valuable information through techniques such as ' water - boarding ' - which was used to save lives			2
@entity8 , which is a pseudonym he coined after 20 years of military service , says there are a number of ' quick , harmful , painful techniques ' which can be used to effectively extract information from a captive			0
he conceded that he only supported the use of torture immediately after a suspect was captured rather than months later , when the information they possessed would be ' out of date '			2
tortured : @entity128 ( pictured ) , who 's believed to be the mastermind behind the september 11 attacks , was water - boarded 183 times justified : the director of the @entity17 , @entity108 ( pictured ) , defended the @entity40 spy agency 's use of torture - saying the information gained through punishment saved lives the former special forces officer was himself tortured by @entity5 forces , after being captured on covert mission during the first @entity141 in january 1991			1
