by @entity1 reporter the next generation of rockets has been revealed as @entity5 founder @entity4 showed off a reusable capsule he says will revolutionize access to space			1
@entity4 , who was behind the @entity10 electric sports car , showed off his @entity11 at the headquarters of his rocket building company near @entity14 on thursday			1
the company has already flown unmanned capsules to the @entity17 , but the latest design will be capable of taking up to seven astronauts into low - earth orbit			1
the technology would enable rapid reloading as well as meaning the spacecraft could be reused he said , noting that in the past rockets and space craft return to @entity40 in a fireball			1
' this is extremely important for revolutionizing access to space because as long as we continue to throw away rockets and space crafts , we will never truly have access to space it 'll always be incredibly expensive , ' @entity4 said			2
the white capsule featured a sleek interior with swing - up computer screens at the control station , a two - level seating system to accommodate up to seven astronauts , and windows for them to marvel at @entity40 's curvature			1
since the shuttle fleet retired in 2011 , @entity59 has depended on @entity62 rockets to transport astronauts to orbit and back , paying nearly $ 71 million per seat			2
countdown : @entity65 of @entity5 stands inside the @entity11 , which is competing for a @entity59 contract high tech : the space shuttle has screens that can fold away , and windows so the crew can watch the @entity40 the space agency said that it wants @entity74 companies to fill the void by 2017 and has handed out seed money to spur innovation			1
@entity5 , which stands for @entity5 , has made four cargo runs to the @entity17 about 200 miles above @entity40			2
last month , its @entity79 splashed into the @entity80 , returning nearly 2 tons of science experiments and old equipment			0
companies competing for the right to ferry station astronauts need to design a spacecraft that can seat a crew of four or more , and be equipped with life support systems and an escape hatch in case of emergency			2
@entity5 has said that it is designing a seven - seat spacecraft			0
@entity5 and longtime @entity59 contractor @entity100 are ' more or less neck and neck ' in the competition , but there 's a long way to go before astronauts can rocket out of the atmosphere on private spacecraft , @entity96 , professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at @entity99 , said			0
next generation : @entity5 says the shuttle will provide a less expensive way to connect to the @entity17 rocket man : @entity4 and his company are competing for rights to be the carrier of astronauts to the @entity115 @entity96 said progress by private companies is slower than anticipated mainly because @entity118 has not fully funded @entity59 's budget request for the effort			0
he said it was important for the @entity74 to wean its reliance on @entity62 given the political tension over the annexation of @entity125			0
' it 's essential to have our own capability to transport people to space , ' he said			0
' this is an important step in that direction			0
