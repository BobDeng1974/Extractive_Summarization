by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 06:44 est , 7 november 2012 officials have banned @entity3 lights from a busy @entity4 for the first time in 20 years unless traders fork out up to £ 4,000 to have lampposts tested for health and safety reasons			1
furious residents and local business owners have slammed a new rule which means the @entity13 must pay for test certificates to ensure lampposts are strong enough to support @entity3 lights			1
the charge was introduced after the @entity4 was designated a red route , meaning it is managed by @entity17 ( @entity17 ) rather than @entity18			2
in happier times : how @entity13 looked during previous festive seasons unseasonal : @entity21 could be without its @entity3 lights this year as one of @entity25 ’s major roads , the @entity4 carries up to 30 per cent of city traffic			1
secretary of the association @entity27 manages the family - run shop waterways , in the @entity4 , which has been running for more 30 years			2
she said : ' we ’ve had @entity3 lights for over 20 years			1
my mum used to do it and then i took it over			0
' it does n’t make a massive difference to trade , it just gives a good community feeling			0
' @entity21 has been a red route for four or five years and they never asked for anything			0
' but last year they said we need to comply with regulations which are different to @entity18 ’s			0
' we ’re going to fight them all the way			0
we wo n’t let them dampen our @entity3 spirits			1
' resident @entity49 , a 70 - year - old retired property executive who has lived in the area for around 35 years , said : ' it has killed the @entity3 spirit in the @entity13 area			1
@entity55 up : traders in @entity13 are furious their @entity4 might be without @entity3 lights this year ' @entity17 is being ridiculous			1
i simply do not understand how something that has worked for a long time is now suddenly unsafe			0
' mr @entity49 , a member of @entity61 , added : ' it ’s just sad because in this economic climate , the traders ca n’t afford it			0
' @entity66 talks about the big society where people do something for themselves and this is what happens			0
' @entity71 , campaign manager of the @entity72 said : ' with money tight councils do n’t have a fortune to spend on @entity3 lights			2
' bureaucrats should n't be making it more expensive to decorate town centres with some @entity3 cheer			1
tradition : @entity13 residents hope they will soon put up their own festive street decorations ' if traders and residents are willing to invest in their community ’s festive celebrations then authorities should support that , not get in the way with needless red tape and bureaucracy			1
' @entity17 director of roads @entity92 said : ' safety on our road network is the top priority and any additional attachments to a lighting column on our road network have to be fully considered to ensure their weight or size does not have the potential to put the public at risk			0
' that is why we have a clear licensing procedure in place to help ensure any applications for decorations can be assessed appropriately			0
' hundreds of these licences are issued for festive decorations across @entity25 every year however we are meeting with local traders tomorrow to discuss the matter , with a look to finding a workable solution			2
' councillor for renewal and recreation @entity119 said : ' the traders have worked extremely hard to gather funds together to decorate their @entity4 and we have supported them in this			0
' we are now pressing @entity17 , who are responsible for this road as a red route , to see if anything can be done to rectify this situation in time for @entity3			2
' a @entity17 spokesman said £ 4,000 was the maximum charge for the tests , which would cover a £ 75 admin fee plus any additional charges required to restrict traffic along the road to install or remove the decorations .			1
