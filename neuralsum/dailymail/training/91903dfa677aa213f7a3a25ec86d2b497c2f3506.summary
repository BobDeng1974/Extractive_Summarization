the judge banned the parents from naming their daughter after the popular @entity4 spread - and renamed her @entity5 instead a @entity7 judge banned parents from naming their daughter @entity4 - because it is the trademarked name of a chocolate spread - and renamed her @entity5 instead			1
after a newborn baby in @entity12 was named after the spread , the judge ruled the parents ' decision was not in the interest of the child			1
but in the absence of the parents , the judge chose to rename the girl @entity5			2
' the name ‘ @entity4 ’ given to the child is the trade name of a spread , ' the court ruled , according to @entity24			0
' and it is contrary to the child ’s interest to have a name that can only lead to teasing or disparaging thoughts			0
' as the parents failed to appear in court on the appointed day in november last year the judge ordered the child , born on september 24 , to be renamed @entity5			1
and a second family , from @entity34 , who named their child @entity35 - or @entity36 - were told the name could ‘ be the cause of mockery ’ that ‘ could have a negative impact on the child ’			0
so they opted to used the name @entity42 , which was popular in the 19th century			0
in @entity7 , parents are free to choose the names of their children , but the registrar checks the name at the time the birth certificate is registered			0
if the chosen name seems contrary to the child 's interest , the registrar must notify the prosecutor - who may then enter a family court order to change the name			2
the court ruled the parents ' decision was against child 's interests and would only lead to ' teasing '			1

@entity65 said parents could *n't* use trademarked name of a chocolate spread
ruled decision was against child 's interests and would lead to ' teasing '
after parents failed to appear in court , the judge renamed her @entity5
