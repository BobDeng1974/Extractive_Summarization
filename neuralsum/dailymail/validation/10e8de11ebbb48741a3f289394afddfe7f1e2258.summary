@entity0 remains ' pretty confident ' his @entity2 side will be crowned @entity4 champions , but @entity5 is an injury concern for their title run - in			1
the @entity9 restored their six - point lead over @entity11 with a 3 - 2 win over spirited @entity13 on sunday and retain a game in hand against rock - bottom @entity16			1
that makes them heavy favourites to lift the trophy and @entity0 was happy to accept the role of front - runners after @entity23 grabbed a 77th minute winner at the @entity25			1
@entity0 is confident that his @entity2 side will be able to secure the @entity4 title this season @entity23 came on as a substitute and scored the winning goal to secure three points for the @entity9 ' i 'm not pretty sure , i 'm pretty confident			1
i believe in my players , i believe that we can do it but i know it 's difficult , ' he said			2
' i keep thinking the same , the title race should be over			0
in normal conditions , @entity2 should have eight , 10 , 12 points more than we have ; title race over			2
' but football is unpredictable and the reality is we have a six - point lead , one game in hand , which is our best situation for the whole season			0
' @entity5 's short - term involvement is an open question , though			2
the @entity49 striker claimed his 20th goal of the season with a wonderful curling effort to put @entity2 2 - 0 up inside nine minutes , but hobbled off with a hamstring injury			1
one negative for @entity2 was the hamstring injury suffered by @entity5 , which ended his involvement @entity5 's replacement , @entity23 , scored the winning goal and @entity0 thinks he has sufficient replacements his exit allowed for @entity23 's match - winning arrival , but whether he emerges from the imminent international break in match condition is uncertain			1
' when a striker is playing , the team needs a goal to win the game and with 15 minutes to go the striker , a guy with a lot of experience of hamstring injuries , says " it is over for me " , then it is over for him , ' said @entity0			1
' he has this problem			0
he tried to play the @entity77 final for @entity78 ( @entity79 , last season ) and was injured again and again and again			0
' we know his hamstring is not a strong one			0
he works hard through the week to compensate the weakness he has there but the injury can come			0
@entity23 ( centre ) celebrates scoring @entity2 's third goal against @entity13 at the @entity25 @entity0 watches on from the bench as his @entity2 side go six points clear of nearest rivals @entity11 ' if he is injured then we have @entity23 , we have @entity94			1
we never cry about injured players			1
' @entity5 can at least expect to miss @entity49 's forthcoming games against @entity97 and @entity98 , but despite the added rehabilitation time , @entity0 would rather be pressing on with the domestic calendar			1
' for @entity5 ( the break ) is good , because imagine we play three matches in one week , that 's three matches he does n't play			2
' but in this moment we have nine matches to play and i would like to play every week , so it 's not good for us			0
' @entity108 scored the first goal of the game inside two minutes to get @entity2 on track @entity112 made an error to gift @entity13 their second , but later made amends with a string of saves @entity2 goalkeeper @entity112 gifted @entity119 an equaliser just a minute after @entity121 made it 2 - 1 , side - footing a back pass straight to the @entity11 striker			1
but @entity125 boss @entity124 believes the @entity127 's brilliance later in the piece was crucial to the outcome			0
@entity112 produced a sensational triple save from @entity121 , @entity131 and @entity132 in the 64th minute to keep the scores level			0
' the big turning point in the game was where @entity112 pulls off three saves which change the course of the game , ' said @entity124 , who was nevertheless delighted with his side 's endeavour			2
' that 's as good as we 've played for a long , long time , against the best team in @entity145			0
' we 're obviously disappointed to lose the game because i do n't think we deserved that			0
' we gave @entity2 a hell of a run for their money and on another day it could have gone our way			2
' i 'm sure we 've got enough and i 'm convinced if we play like that , we 're good enough to stay in this division			0

@entity2 went 2 - 0 up against @entity13 , but were pulled back to 2 - 2
@entity23 scored @entity2 's third goal to secure all three points
@entity0 is ' pretty confident ' that his side will win the league
@entity5 hobbled off with a hamstring injury , but @entity0 said : ' we never cry about injured players '
