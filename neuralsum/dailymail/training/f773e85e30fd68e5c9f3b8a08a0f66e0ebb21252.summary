strategy chief @entity5 ( right ) , who earns £ 295,000 , and finance director @entity6 , on £ 395,000 , were accused of ‘ scare tactics ’ as they threatened to slash the programming budget to save more money meanwhile mr @entity5 – who is a former @entity21 cabinet minister – refused to rule out the closure of another tv channel such as arts station @entity25 to save cash			1
but @entity28 mp @entity27 claimed yesterday there was ‘ plenty more fat to be cut from the @entity2 ’s bloated management ’ and accused them of trying to frighten viewers into supporting an increase in the licence fee			1
he said : ‘ this is a scare tactic to get public support for the @entity2 budget			0
this has @entity5 ’s fingerprints all over it			1
it used to be a standard @entity21 tactic to cut essential services rather than salaries			2
‘ then they complain about how hard the cuts are affecting ordinary people , while holding on to their own pay deals			0
i just hope the @entity50 and the public do n’t fall for it			0
this reminds me of the dark arts of the @entity56 spin years			0
’ miss @entity6 published a report entitled @entity58 at the @entity2 in which she said the corporation had made £ 1.1billion in annual savings since 2007 , but needs to find an extra £ 400million a year by 2017			1

she insisted that by reducing senior manager numbers and pay , the @entity2 had saved £ 20million a year , but argued that ‘ the @entity2 ’s ability to deliver efficiencies in the same scale is reducing ’			0

director general @entity76 – who earns £ 450,000 a year - has already announced plans to axe youth channel @entity79 , but it is thought @entity25 could be the next to go thirteen of the @entity2 ’s most senior directors – who control its news , radio and tv channels – are paid a combined £ 3.6million			2
director general @entity76 – who earns £ 450,000 a year - has already announced plans to axe youth channel @entity79 , but it is thought @entity25 could be the next to go			2
interviewed on @entity88 ’s today programme , mr @entity5 refused to rule out scrapping the arts station , saying only : ‘ we ’re not announcing anything about @entity25 today			1
‘ we do n’t want to close @entity25			0
what we are doing is making efficiency savings … we ’re saving as much money as we possibly can			0
’ in her report , miss @entity6 complained that although the £ 145.50 licence fee has remained the same since 2010 , the @entity96 has seen its real terms funding had decreased by 26 per cent because of inflation and increased obligations , such as the need to fund broadband rollout			1
but @entity103 , @entity104 , said : ‘ the @entity2 should be doing what it can to save money and cut frivolous services that do n’t adhere to its public service commitment			2
