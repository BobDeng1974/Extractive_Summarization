but @entity49 has refused to carry out the procedure saying it is not ‘ exceptional ’			1
mr @entity4 said : ' it ’s really frustrating , i was hoping the operation would shut the door on this nightmare			1
i want to get my life back			2
' because one leg is shorter than the other as a result of my injuries i ca n’t balance at the moment			2
i have to walk with sticks			2
' in future it could lead to hip problems and back problems			0
i was told because of where i live , it ’s not on the list of procedures that they do			0
it ’s a post code lottery			0
' x-ray : duncans lower legs , shows how he was left with a damaged left knee and legs of different lengths , making him hobble overcoming adversity : mr @entity4 undergoing physio on @entity81 at the @entity82 in @entity83 on @entity84 long road : mr @entity4 's left knee was repaired after the smash ( l ) while his elbow needed reconstruction ( r ) he added : ' i ca n’t work at the moment but i want to get back to my job as a web tutor			1

i ’m disappointed with the hospital ’s decision			0
' after the accident near @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity4 was cut out of his car and airlifted to hospital - where doctors fought for hours to save him			1
