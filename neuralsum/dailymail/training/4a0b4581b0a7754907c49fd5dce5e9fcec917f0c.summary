@entity0 walked out of @entity1 after only a week in the job after being asked to accept a pay - cut that in turn would cover the salary of another new coach ; @entity7			1
in consultation with his legal team the former @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 manager is now understood to be considering a case of constructive dismissal			0
having agreed the terms of his employment to become assistant head coach to new boss @entity19 – indeed he was even sent a draft of his contract by the club – @entity0 was then staggered to find himself being asked to accept a revised salary package			1
@entity0 left @entity1 after only a week as assistant head coach to @entity19 this , @entity24 understands , was a request made by @entity19 but only after it was made clear to @entity27 by his new employers that he could not add @entity7 to his team if it meant spending more than the agreed figure on his new backroom staff			1
@entity0 and fellow coach @entity32 were asked to consider a pay cut – believed to be less than £ 20,000 each – last friday , with @entity0 returning on monday to say that , having given the matter some thought , he was leaving after only seven days into his new role			2
while the 50 - year - old had not signed the original contract , believed to be worth well in excess of £ 100,000 a year , he had already begun working for the club on those fiscal terms and he felt his new employers had unilaterally altered his payment			0
the news comes as a blow to @entity19 , who is looking to guide @entity1 to @entity47 safety while @entity1 do not deny the request for a pay - cut was was behind @entity0 ’s departure , they insisted they had not broken any agreement with @entity0			1
' we would dispute most strongly any suggestion that we have reneged on a deal , ' said a spokesman			0
but a club that has been accused of penny - pinching in the past does appear to have lost a valuable member of its new coaching staff over what seems to be a relatively small amount of money			0
angered by reports in wednesday ’s newspapers that he had left by mutual consent , @entity0 issued a statement of his own			1
@entity7 has replaced @entity0 at @entity1 , continuing a seven - year working partnership with @entity70 ‘ my departure was not by mutual consent , ’ he said			1
‘ it is in the hands of my lawyer			0
i will not be making any further comment at this stage			0
’ an official club statement issued on tuesday night said only : ‘ @entity0 decided that he will not be continuing his recent assistance on a more formal basis			2
’ @entity0 ’s appointment represented a bold move by @entity19 , who likes to surround himself with experienced deputies			1
his working relationship with @entity7 now enters a seventh year			2
the former @entity86 and @entity87 manager had been helping @entity1 informally on a part - time basis since the 7 - 0 cup win over @entity89 earlier this month			2
asked by @entity90 on wednesday if he was unaware of the reasons behind @entity0 's departure , he said : ‘ i 've no idea			1
he was there saturday , i was there saturday at the game			0
i do n't really know what the situation is from that point of view			0
i only found out myself last night			0
' the situation leaves @entity19 now searching for another assistant , given that @entity7 only works part - time			1
while @entity0 has already been linked with a move to @entity104 to assist @entity105 .			0
