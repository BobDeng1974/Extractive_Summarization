beneath the arms and armour of a thousand years of monarchy , the former chief of the @entity2 ’s @entity1 had dinner with the @entity7 at @entity8 last night			2
and he heard her declare firmly : ‘ we are walking together towards a brighter , more settled , future			0
we shall remember our past but we will no longer allow our past to ensnare our future			0
’ on a day brimming with powerful symbolism in honour of the first state visit by a @entity19 , there were so many historic moments to choose from – president @entity21 bowing at @entity23 ’s @entity22 and addressing both houses of @entity25 ; the @entity27 head of state being invited ( in @entity27 ) to inspect the @entity28			1
but even the clattering pomp of a full state carriage procession through cheering @entity8 streets festooned with the @entity27 tricolour could not match the significance of @entity34 – in white tie and tails – rising to toast the @entity37 and the @entity39 people at last night ’s state banquet			1
on this reciprocal visit , he was determined not to misjudge the mood again			1
so it was that mr @entity34 found himself seated just 16 places down from the @entity54 – between scientist sir @entity55 and @entity56 of the pressure group , @entity57			1
shortly before taking his place , as the orchestra played a light @entity27 medley , he could be seen deep in conversation with both the @entity39 and @entity63 prime ministers			1
@entity34 at the start of the @entity65 in honour of the @entity27 president at @entity44 with @entity68 , left and @entity27 prime minister @entity69 @entity34 , the deputy first minister of northern ireland , top right , talks with @entity39 prime minister @entity68 , left , and @entity27 prime minister , @entity69 there could hardly have been a more quintessentially @entity39 – or , indeed , @entity74 – setting			1
@entity75 , built in homage to @entity74 ’s patron saint by @entity78 , boasts @entity39 ’s longest table , a 168ft mahogany piece longer than an @entity82 swimming pool			2
yesterday it was heaving with gold candelabra , flowers and more than 2,000 pieces of cutlery and linen			0
every table setting ( laid out with a ruler , 17 inches apart ) included priceless @entity92 china and @entity94 crystal			0
a dinner of @entity97 halibut and tournedos of @entity8 beef was accompanied by a 2005 @entity100 and a fine claret , @entity102 1990			0
for teetotallers such as mr @entity34 , there was @entity106 apple juice and @entity107 the theme of her visit three years ago , the @entity37 urged her 160 guests – an unusually celeb - packed collection including sir @entity112 and @entity113 and actors @entity114 and @entity116 – to look to the future			1
this was no mean feat in a 14th - century chamber lined with a dozen suits of armour and the shields of every @entity124 in history			0
@entity126 ‘ the goal of modern @entity39 - @entity27 relations can be simply stated , ’ said the @entity37			1
‘ it is that we , who inhabit these islands , should live together as neighbours and friends ; respectful of each other ’s nationhood , sovereignty and traditions ; co-operating to our mutual benefit ; at ease in each other ’s company			2
’ dressed in her @entity144 portrait gown , she had even ordered emerald green droplets to be inserted into the @entity148 @entity147 tiara in honour of her guests			0
so , too , was the harp playing @entity153 as the royal procession came in to dinner			0
in what must rank as one of her most significant speeches in recent years , the @entity37 even made direct reference to her most controversial guest : ‘ our two governments will continue to work together in @entity27 to support the @entity162 and deputy first minister			1
’ @entity34 at the start of the @entity65 in honour of the @entity27 president at @entity44 the latter is also a man whose comrades - in - arms murdered the @entity171 ’s uncle , @entity168 , along with thousands of innocents			1
yet the @entity37 first met mr @entity34 during her @entity144 visit to @entity27 in 2012			1
last night brought another introduction , away from the cameras , as all the guests were presented to the @entity37 , the @entity171 and @entity34 and mrs @entity177 on their way through to dinner			1
as protocol dictates , the @entity54 was not part of the greeting line ( which involves only heads of state and their spouses ) and so was not due to meet the former @entity2 capo			2
given the @entity54 ’s closeness to @entity168 , this was probably a relief to both			2
labour leader @entity189 talks to @entity27 politician and former @entity2 leader @entity34 at @entity65 at @entity44 as ever the @entity37 was speaking on the advice of her ministers			1
the only veiled hint of any personal loss came as she reflected on ‘ so much chequered history , the avoidable and regrettable pain of which is still felt by many of us ’			0
@entity34 photographed after a brief talk with @entity68 at the banquet the presence of mr @entity34 was too much for some			1
outside the castle , a small group of grieving families held up banners demanding justice for the victims of the @entity2 bombings in @entity211 and @entity212			0
the protesters , however , conceded that the @entity37 had no option but to invite mr @entity34 since that is what her government had asked of her			1
after all she has been obliged to entertain some 24 - carat monsters in her time , not least the @entity219 of @entity220 and the @entity221 of @entity222 ( who smuggled a dog in their luggage )			0
a key theme of this visit is the @entity27 contribution to @entity39 life			1
last night , the @entity37 saluted all the @entity27 - born soldiers who gave their lives for king and country in the @entity234			1
and she did not duck another unhappy relic of the past : ‘ many @entity27 migrants to @entity39 encountered discrimination and a lack of appreciation			2
happily , those days are now behind us			0
’ there was humour , too			0
harking back to the @entity82 , the @entity37 drew warm laughter as she added : ‘ it took someone of @entity27 descent – @entity247 – to get me to jump from a helicopter			2
’ in his response , president @entity21 , a former arts minister who writes his own poetry , echoed the @entity37 ’s sentiments			1
‘ through conquest and resistance , we have cast shadows on each other , but we have also gained strength from one another as neighbours , ’ he said			0
this ‘ joyous occasion ’ would ‘ celebrate the bonds of mutual understanding between our two peoples , and the warm , enduring friendship on which we have so happily embarked ’			0
@entity34 arriving at @entity44 last night for the @entity65 held by the queen earlier , he had received the traditional honour of a carriage procession with a full escort from the @entity270			2
some @entity27 spectators wondered why the @entity37 and her guest were travelling in the @entity273 rather than the @entity63 state coach			1
the @entity273 model , however , is the only one with heating			0
and @entity63 was hardly under - represented			0
every single one of the 161 horses on parade is actually @entity27			2
the @entity280 buys all its chargers there			0
royal welcome : the @entity37 and prince @entity171 with mr @entity21 and his wife @entity283 pose for a photograph ahead of the @entity65 at @entity44 after presenting the @entity286 with a smart new coat for the enormous regimental mascot , domhnall the wolfhound , mr @entity21 was ushered in to the castle for a private lunch and an intriguing exhibition of royal / @entity27 artefacts			1
these included queen @entity296 ’s own journals about her trips to @entity27 and a book of poems which @entity301 presented to the future @entity302 much in evidence were the works of @entity27 - born @entity305 , including a fiery letter to the @entity307 attacking the powers of censorship enjoyed ( no longer ) by the @entity7 ’s @entity310			2
the historic sights are far from over			0
mr @entity34 will be back here tomorrow for a @entity27 reception and another meeting with the @entity37			1
later , he will join her at the @entity314			0
it ’s not so long ago that his old mob were trying to blow it up			0
still , that ’s progress for you .			0

mr @entity34 boycotted @entity37 ’s state visit to the @entity49 in 2011
on this reciprocal visit , he was determined not to misjudge the mood again
mr @entity34 was seated just 16 places down from the @entity54
captured in conversation with both the @entity39 and @entity27 prime ministers
