mobile app developers are collecting vast amounts of data from children online , including a person 's location and even recordings of their voice , according to privacy researchers and consumer advocates			1
a landmark 2013 law aimed at protecting the privacy of @entity15 's youngest mobile consumers has n't stopped the developers , it has been revealed			1
whether mobile app developers seek parental consent first — as required by law — or pass the information on to advertisers is n't entirely clear			1
an attendee pis pictured playing @entity23 at the @entity25 booth at the @entity26 in @entity28 - apps like this one collects information from the user for advertisers but if you prefer to stay anonymous , your options are limited : wade through each mobile app 's privacy policies to make sure you are ok with the terms , or stick the phone on ' airplane mode ' to shut off the wireless connection and risk losing functionality			1
' kids are such a lucrative market , especially for apps , ' said @entity46 , executive director of the @entity47			0
' unfortunately , there are still companies out there that are more concerned about generating revenue than protecting the privacy of kids			1
' @entity15 have traded vast amounts of personal data in exchange for the ease and functionality of fun mobile applications on their phones			1
but how is industry using that information ? @entity64 and other consumer advocates allege that fast food chains are increasingly focusing advertising dollars on digital media , targeting blacks and @entity70			0
they also warn that data from phones can be combined with offline information like home prices , race or income in ways that could violate fair lending laws			0
a new site , @entity80 , found that many popular kids ' apps like @entity83 and @entity23 collect information in ways parents would n't necessarily expect			1
concerned in particular about industries ' focus on kids online , the @entity86 in july 2013 expanded the @entity90 , or @entity90 , to require app developers to get parental consent before collecting personal data on anyone younger than 13			1
that includes information like the unique identifying device on a phone , a person 's phone number or a device 's location			2
' it 's upped the ante for companies deciding whether they are going to market to kids , ' said @entity108 of the @entity109			0
' and that 's a good thing			0
' but with the number of smartphones expected to reach 3.5 billion in the next five years , according to @entity113 , the mobile app and advertising industry has exploded			1
regulators do n't have an easy , automated way of analyzing the hundreds of mobile apps popping up each day			2
since the updated regulation went into effect , the @entity86 has brought about only two enforcement actions against mobile apps			2
last september , the commission announced that @entity123 agreed to pay $ 450,000 and @entity124			0
$ 300,000 to settle separate charges that their companies knowingly collected information on young children through their mobile apps			1
' our ultimate goal is compliance , ' said @entity133 , an attorney in the @entity86 's @entity134			0
but ' that does n't undermine our desire to bring cases against companies that violate @entity90 ... where we find violations , we will bring cases against mobile apps			2
' according to @entity80 , which is run by computer scientists at @entity146 , scores of apps that collect information are still aimed at kids			2
for example , @entity23 collects a phone 's location , which could be passed on to advertisers			1
and @entity83 , where kids can talk to and ' tickle ' an alley cat using the touch screen , collects a child 's audio recordings along with other information that can uniquely identify a phone			2
whether these apps would violate @entity90 would depend on a number of factors , including whether and how they seek parental consent			0
but because these apps collect information in surprising ways , @entity80 gave them both @entity170 grades			0
@entity171 , the developer behind @entity83 , said in a statement that personal information and recordings are never shared with advertisers			0
the developer says its app also complies with @entity90 by providing ' appropriate gate protections ... to distinguish adults from minors and restrict sharing on social media , ' according to the statement			0
@entity184 , which developed @entity23 , said in a statement that it planned to release updates to @entity23 and other apps to increase privacy protections			2
' parents and players are understandably cautious about the privacy aspects of online games , and the way their data is handled , ' said company ceo @entity195			1
' creating a safe and secure app is no longer enough to answer consumers ' needs for assurance			0
developers must also ensure that permissions are clearly explained and easy to access at every applicable point in a game			0

many game apps aimed at children are collecting data from children for advertisers
this is happening despite the landmark 2013 law aimed at protecting @entity15 's youngs mobile consumers ' privacy
parents should check each mobile app 's privacy settings or put the phone on ' airplane mode ' to protect their children
