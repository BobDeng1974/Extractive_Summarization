there we were thinking this was an all - new @entity3			1
here was a match which , for much of it , appeared to build on that 2 - 0 away win at @entity6 in january			1
the renaissance @entity3 team seems solid , workmanlike and ready to hit teams on the counter			1
with @entity12 orchestrating , @entity11 turning into a warrior - like centre forward who can hold the ball up superbly , and the speed and skill of @entity19 and @entity20 wide , they are perfectly equipped to play this type of game			1
and with @entity25 ’s importance growing with every game , there seemed to be a solidity about @entity3 which has rarely been evident in the past			1
it is , however , something of a mirage , an illusion			0
they might appear more robust but their fragility seems to haunt them , hanging around like an un-exorcised spirit			0
@entity36 puts @entity3 into the lead from the penalty spot to score his seventh @entity40 goal of the season the @entity43 midfielder celebrates after sending @entity44 the wrong way to put the @entity46 a goal up at @entity48 @entity20 is brought down by @entity49 for the penalty but his challenge appeared to be just outside the box @entity11 pokes home from close range to make it 2 - 0 in first half stoppage time , somewhat against the run of play @entity11 is congratulated by @entity20 after scoring his 50th goal for @entity3 , following a @entity44 save @entity20 looked to be just offside during the build - up to @entity11 's strike at @entity48 @entity62 stabs home from close range following a goalmouth scramble to give @entity66 a sniff of a point , but it came too late @entity19 celebrates @entity3 's victory over @entity66 at @entity48 in his pants with his teammates @entity3 were in control of this game			1
the clock was ticking on and three minutes of injury time had been play when @entity78 met a corner at the far post			1
amidst the confusion – a ricochet off @entity83 , a bounce off per mertesacker – @entity85 drove in shot which @entity87 parried and in snuck substitute @entity62 to prod home a goal			1
still , it was no more than a consolation			0
barely enough time remained for @entity3 to kick off			1
yet within the remaining 90 seconds , @entity3 demonstrated sufficient vulnerability to ruin their new image			2
@entity95 went tearing down the left and swung in a cross			0
@entity87 came diving out to punch away and missed the ball completely			0
at the far post lurked @entity62 waiting to head home			2
he met the ball cleanly and yet hit the post with the ball rebounding into the hands of the fortunate and relieved @entity87			0
that last kick – or head – of the game should have seen @entity3 forfeit two points			2
and even though it did n’t , it was enough to suggest that old habits die hard			0
if @entity3 have truly changed , then maybe they could yet enjoy a sustained run in the @entity114 and approach an @entity116 tie at @entity117 with confidence			2
the final two minutes on injury time yesterday suggested otherwise			2
‘ we can learn from every game and i believe the players know that they switched off a little bit early , ’ said @entity120 ruefully			0
‘ certainly they thought it was done			0
in the @entity40 it is never done			0
and when that header went off the post , we were a bit fortunate			0
’ @entity66 were doughty opponents yesterday			2
they absolutely make the most of what they have			0
the return of @entity137 from winning the @entity138 with @entity139 adds more fortitude to an already hard - working midfield			2
the pace of @entity143 and @entity85 and later @entity95 was always a threat			0
@entity66 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity44 6 ; @entity145 6.5 , @entity146 6.5 , @entity147 6.5 , @entity148 6 ; @entity149 6.5 ( @entity78 79 mins ) , @entity150 7 , @entity151 6.5 ; @entity152 6.5 , @entity143 6.5 ( @entity62 79 ) , @entity153 6 ( @entity95 57 , 7 ) subs not used : @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity137 , @entity157 goal : @entity62 booked : @entity159 @entity3 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity160 6.5 ; @entity161 6.5 , mertesacker 7 , @entity162 7 , @entity163 6.5 ; @entity25 7 , @entity36 7 ; @entity19 7 ( @entity164 89 ) , @entity12 7 ( @entity83 76 ) , @entity20 7 ( @entity165 76 ) ; @entity11 7.5 subs not used : @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170			1
goals : @entity36 ( pen ) , @entity11 booked : @entity25 , @entity11 , @entity161 referee : @entity174 5.5 @entity175 : @entity11 attendance : 24 , 721 @entity11 started and finished the move for @entity3 's second goal			1
the strike came from a lovely @entity19 pass to @entity20 , whose shot was parried into the path of @entity11			1
for more stats , pitch maps and analysis see our brilliant match zone @entity146 ( left ) and @entity187 argue with referee @entity174 after the penalty was awarded , but it was a clear foul @entity36 made no mistake from the penalty spot in the eighth minute , converting from 12 yards for the sixth time this season @entity44 goes the wrong way as @entity194 keeps his cool from the penalty spot to put the @entity46 into an early lead @entity36 is congratulated by his team - mates as @entity3 looked to pick up an eighth win in nine games ‘ that ’s probably the best we ’ve played since i ’ve been manager , ’ said @entity200			1
‘ the one that hit the post and goes in the keeper ’s hands summed our day up really			0
i actually though the spin of the ball was going to take it into the net when it came off the post			0
it could have gone anywhere			0
it was n’t to be			0
there was some great team play , some great individual moments and probably the best players were on our team , but we ’ve lost			0
’ @entity3 were presented with an unexpected foothold in the game with a penalty on 8 minutes			1
@entity66 were aggrieved but perhaps only to spare the blushes of @entity222			2
only last week @entity200 was warning that it would take the @entity224 left back time to adjust to the speed and intensity of the @entity40			2
he was miles off the pace on seven minutes , mis - controlling the ball and then lunging at @entity20 as the @entity3 player chased the ball down ruthlessly			1
@entity66 ’s complaint was that initial contact occurred outside the box – though @entity234 planted his foot on the line of the penalty area and his leg appeared to follow through into the box as he felled @entity20			1
‘ it ’s a mistake and he should better but the call is tough on us as it looked as if the incident happened outside the box , ’ said @entity200			0
‘ he just got caught out and dwelled ion it and he ’ll need to learn from that			0
’ though it took several replays to ascertain the truth , on this occasion the instincts of the referee and his assistant were correct			0
@entity36 took the spot kick , swept it confidently to his right and celebrated enthusiastically in front of the @entity66 fans			1
thereafter , @entity66 played rather well but it was turning into a scrappy , physical game with little direction until @entity3 extended their lead on 43 minutes			1
this time @entity66 had legitimate cause for complaint			1
@entity85 skips past @entity265 in the opening moments , and the @entity268 winger caused his full back plenty of problems @entity152 attempts to put a cross in as he provided @entity66 's major creative outlet in the early stages at @entity48 @entity11 holds the ball up under pressure from @entity276 , but the @entity3 striker was starved of ball in the first half @entity162 halts the run of @entity150 with a well - timed tackle as @entity66 struggled to create clear - cut chances ‘ it ’s a mistake and he should better but the call is tough on us as it looked as if the incident happened outside the box , ’ said @entity200			1
‘ he just got caught out and dwelled ion it and he ’ll need to learn from that			0

@entity19 leads an @entity3 break			2
the @entity308 played a brilliant pass to @entity20 in the build - up to @entity3 's second goal @entity19 ( right ) tracks back to help his full back @entity265 deal with @entity152 , as @entity66 responded well to going behind @entity147 's despairing dive ca n't stop the ball reaching @entity11 , who tapped home to extend the @entity3 lead before the break @entity11 celebrates with @entity36 and full back @entity318 after doubling @entity3 's advantage shortly before half time @entity11 's goal came against the run of play , with @entity66 causing @entity3 plenty of problems without hitting the target in the first 45 minutes though the ball from @entity19 for @entity20 was utterly sublime , the effect was ruined somewhat by @entity20 starting his run a fraction early and ending up in an offside position - just – as the ball was played			1
he shot , @entity44 parried and @entity11 , who has been superb holding the ball up in the build up , followed up from close range to score his 50th for the club			1
‘ the second goal is offside , ’ said @entity200			0
‘ and that should be made that call			0
i had more problems with the second goal than the first			0
it ’s just before half time and you have to get that call right			2
’ @entity66 were much brighter in the second half			1
@entity265 was required to block a @entity152 strike amidst a chaotic goal - mouth scramble			2
@entity49 showed his attacking qualities with a delightful cross which @entity143 met and headed wide			0
their efforts were ultimately in vain			0
but they came mightily close to exposing @entity3			2
@entity12 is tackled by @entity150 as @entity3 kept up their good form to move back into the @entity114 places @entity20 , who was involved in both @entity3 goals , breaks past the bearded @entity149 as @entity3 attempted to close the game out @entity25 , who has been a crucial part of @entity3 's recent form , takes a tumble after jumping with @entity159 per @entity362 heads away from @entity159 with @entity161 watching on , but for all their pressure @entity66 rarely tested @entity87 @entity120 throws his arms up in frustration during a performance that was n't always convincing , but earned his side three points @entity36 carries the ball away from @entity150 as @entity3 put in a disciplined , if unspectacular , performance to go third in the league			1

@entity36 puts @entity3 in front on eight minutes after @entity20 was brought down in the box
@entity11 makes it 2 - 0 in first half stoppage time after @entity44 had saved a @entity20 shot
@entity66 showed fight and *dominated* for spells , but did n't manage a shot on target until the 83rd minute
@entity62 pulls a goal back for the hosts deep into stoppage time
