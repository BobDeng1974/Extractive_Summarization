@entity11 , an 18 - year - old business manager from @entity12 , is no stranger to hard knocks but refuses to let them stop her from pursuing her dream career in ballet			1
on the verge of giving up her dreams because she was deemed too fat to be a dancer , she says her appearance on @entity22 's @entity21 proves once and for all that nothing should stand in the way of bigger girls desperate for a dancing career			1
' i have danced since the age of three and i have always loved it , ' she explained in an interview with the @entity47			2

nevertheless , after being turned down for ballet school because , she believes , of her weight , she had almost given up on her dreams when the chance to be in @entity141 came along			1
