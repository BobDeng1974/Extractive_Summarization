by @entity0 @entity2 ’s £ 16million transfer from @entity3 to @entity4 has caused plenty of excitement on the red half of @entity8 , and according to industry experts , the @entity9 have kopped a bargain by paying £ 14m less than the @entity13 striker is currently worth			1
analysts at @entity16 - based @entity15 have placed ‘ market values ’ on top players from around @entity19 based on a wide range of ‘ objective ’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position , performance data and international experience			0
the comparison between transfer fees paid by clubs to sign new players and their current market value allows us to assess the best and worst recruitments from a financial perspective			0
great value : experts say @entity4 's purchase of @entity2 for £ 16m represents excellent value , given that the player 's true worth is nearer £ 30m ready for action : @entity2 in training at @entity4 's @entity44 training ground ahead of a possible debut at @entity46 on sunday @entity2 ( @entity3 to @entity4 ) paid : £ 16m value : £ 30m ( - £ 14m ) @entity48 ( @entity49 to @entity50 ) paid : £ 32m value : £ 40m ( - £ 8m ) @entity52 ( @entity50 to @entity53 ) paid : £ 50m value : £ 24m ( + £ 26m ) they calculate that @entity2 was worth £ 30m , based on a market rates for what a buyer should have reasonably paid for him this summer			1
that is £ 14m less than @entity4 paid for him and explains why manager @entity63 called the deal ‘ outstanding value ’			1
the @entity2 deal represents the best value signing for a @entity69 club so far this window from a financial perspective , with @entity4 paying just over half of his transfer value			2
@entity75 and @entity50 have pulled off the best sale involving a @entity69 club so far during this transfer window , by offloading @entity79 defender @entity52 to @entity53 for £ 50m - £ 26m more than his transfer valuation of £ 24m			1
good business : @entity50 did very well to get £ 50m for @entity52 , who is actually worth £ 24m shrewd operator : @entity75 sanctioned the sale of @entity52 , which has pocketed @entity50 £ 26m @entity85 ( @entity4 to @entity86 ) paid : £ 75m value : £ 85m ( - £ 10m ) @entity88 ( @entity89 to @entity90 ) paid : £ 60m value : £ 25m ( + £ 35m ) @entity92 ( @entity86 to @entity93 ) paid : £ 35m value : £ 23m ( + £ 12m ) without the attraction of @entity97 this season @entity90 appear willing to overpay to ensure they continue to attract the best players			1
@entity88 represents the most over-valued player brought in by a @entity69 club			0
@entity90 paid @entity89 £ 60m for the versatile @entity104 @entity103 star , but is ‘ worth ’ just £ 25m - suggesting the club have overpaid by a massive £ 35m			1
however the club ’s deal for @entity108 was close to his market value			0
the fee of £ 27m paid to @entity111 to secure his services , was just £ 2.5m over his valuation of £ 24.5m			0
over the odds : the research suggests @entity90 have paid £ 35m more for @entity88 than his value @entity119 is right : the research suggests @entity90 have paid the going rate for @entity108 while @entity4 may have pulled off a coup to bring in @entity2 , it seems the @entity125 club sold @entity85 to @entity86 for £ 10m less than his worth			1
despite bringing in £ 75m to the club ’s coffers , @entity85 ’s value was actually £ 85m			1
uncharacteristically , @entity130 appears to have overspent to secure the services of @entity92 from @entity86			0
the @entity133 winger was brought to the @entity134 for £ 35m , £ 12m more than his book value - although his winner against @entity137 this week secured @entity97 football for the @entity139 again this season and will have paid much of that amount back			2
other major transfers involving @entity69 clubs have seen players move for amounts close to @entity15 valuations			0
@entity147 snapped up @entity148 for a club - record £ 28m , £ 2m less than his value , while @entity151 joined @entity50 from @entity86 for £ 26.6m			2
he was valued at £ 28.5m			2
follow @entity0 on @entity152 @ alexmiller73 @entity153 : @entity93 have spent £ 12m more on @entity92 than his desk value			0

@entity2 's £ 16m transfer to @entity4 is the best transfer business of the summer - £ 14m less than his transfer value
@entity50 's transfer of @entity52 is the best sale , a *whopping* £ 26m over his transfer value
@entity90 overpaid by £ 35m to land di @entity163
@entity85 is valued at £ 85m , *meaning* @entity4 *undersold* by £ 10m
