by @entity0 night of the living : a new study shows that people undergoing heart surgery have a lower death rate if their operation is done when the moon is starting to wane for thousands of years , people feared the moon could change us into werewolves or even mermaids			1
these days , alternative health gurus sell calendars that show the ' best ' lunar phase for losing weight ( supposedly a waning moon - one that is getting smaller in the sky ) or using face packs ( a waxing moon - which is getting larger )			1
such ideas may seem scientifically laughable			0
but might there be something in them ? last week , @entity26 surgeons reported that people undergoing heart surgery have a lower death rate if their operation is done when the moon is starting to wane			1
the study at @entity32 followed 210 patients who 'd undergone surgery between january 1996 and december 2011 to repair life - threatening tears in the lining of the aorta , a rare condition known as aortic dissection			0
dr @entity40 , the lead researcher and chief cardiothoracic surgeon , says : ' we found the odds of dying following the procedure were greatly reduced during the waning full moon , and that length of stay was also reduced during the full moon			1
' indeed , people who had the surgery during a full moon stayed in hospital for an average of ten days , compared with 14 for those who underwent it at other times in the lunar cycle , according to a report in the journal @entity59 and @entity60			2
this kind of lunar influence - also known as the ' @entity63 ' - has long caused rows among medical experts			1
does the moon really affect our bodies , or is such evidence is merely the result of coincidences and statistical quirks ? a report in april 's @entity73 seems to support the moon - believers			1
as with the @entity32 study , it found that the waning moon just after a full moon may protect people 's hearts			1
the researchers , from the @entity82 of @entity83 , @entity84 , studied the records of 16,000 heart - attack victims , and also found significantly fewer attacks occurred in the three days after a new moon			2
some experts believe this may be caused by the moon 's gravitational pull affecting heart functions			1
when the moon is full , and at new moons ( when the sun and moon are aligned ) , the gravitational pull of the moon and sun are combined , and gravity is thought to be at its strongest			2
the idea is that this may have the most beneficial effect on human circulation at or just after a full moon			1
evidence for this effect has also been found in @entity109 by researchers at @entity111			2
they asked 80 students to do exercises every day for a month while having their heart rate , blood pressure and athletic performance monitored			0
the ' @entity63 ' : some experts believe the moon 's gravitational pull affects heart functions the results suggested that at full moons , people 's cardiovascular systems were working at their most efficient rates , reported the @entity126 last november			1
some medics also believe that the moon 's gravitational pull can affect the flow of fluid in the human body			1
if this is the case , then it should prompt kidney - stone trouble at times when the moon 's pull is strongest - at full moons and new moons			1
one study , in the journal @entity141 , found that hospital admissions for kidney stones did n't vary according to lunar cycles			0
however , other research suggests the opposite			0
in 2011 , the @entity148 published evidence from a study of nearly 1,500 patients that renal colic - pain commonly caused by kidney stones - seemed to increase significantly at the time of the full moon			1
furthermore , a study at the @entity157 in 2008 found that emergency urological admissions did seem to be affected by lunar phases			0
' emergency urological admissions were higher on full - moon days , ' said lead researcher @entity162 in the journal @entity164			2
' the new moon had a calming effect			2
' the pull of gravity may also make a difference to other fluids in our bodies - even our brains - according to @entity175 researchers			2
their study of more than 5,400 patients in 2011 showed that emergency admissions of psychiatric patients rose during full - moon periods			2
the researchers , from @entity183 , @entity184 , suggest this may be caused by the moon 's gravity affecting the flow of fluids in the brain - and in individual brain cells - which in turn may alter people 's mood and behaviour			1
controversial findings : results from this study suggest that at full moons , people 's cardiovascular systems were working at their most efficient rates the effect of the moon on patients ' health has also been noted by @entity206			1
in a study published in the doctors ' newspaper pulse , dr @entity210 , a gp in @entity212 , interviewed 79 general practitioners and found that emergency calls for all conditions increased by 3 per cent at full moon and dropped by 6 per cent during a new moon			2
similar research at @entity219 has found that @entity211 consultation rates rise by 3.6 per cent during a full moon			2
many experts remain highly sceptical , however			0
numerous studies have found no influence in areas where the moon was thought to have power			0
for example , the moon may have been worshipped in ancient times as the goddess of fertility and delivery , but there seems to be no link between its phases and the rates of childbirth			0
this was the conclusion of a study of 13,000 births by @entity244 's @entity243 , published in the @entity126 of @entity245 last july , which investigated whether this phenomenon existed			0
some @entity84 scientists seem particularly keen to debunk the idea of lunar influence			0
surveys in @entity84 show that more than one in ten people are convinced that the moon affects their health , and lunar calendars with recommendations for daily life have become increasingly popular there			1
some people have claimed that the lunar phase may produce more beneficial outcomes in other surgery , such as hip replacements , but @entity84 statistical research so far has shown there 's no link			0
but even if we accept that the moon has an effect , this may not be due only to the moon 's gravitational pull , argue some scientists			1
rather , the effect might be due to the way the moon 's proximity distorts the @entity279 's magnetic field			1
however , sceptics say that such effects are tiny compared with our home environment , which is full of magnets			0
perhaps lunar influence could also come down to something simpler than invisible forces			0
it might be caused by changes in natural levels of light			0
the full moon 's light is up to 16 times greater than at other lunar phases			1
researchers at @entity295 have discovered that the number of epileptic seizures , which are related to electrical activity in the brain , falls when the moon is at its brightest			0
' these findings suggest that epileptic seizures are less likely to occur on brighter nights , ' says dr @entity304 from the @entity305 , who led the study			0
she believes the hormone melatonin , secreted only at night and in the dark , might be implicated , although it is not clear how			0
so far , all these research efforts leave us with more tantalising questions than answers			0
and , as dr @entity40 , author of the latest research , has asked , even if we do prove that the moon has a medical influence , what should we do with that knowledge ? while it may help some people with epilepsy to reduce their risk of fits on certain nights , it would cause widespread chaos if hospitals cancelled all surgical operations on nights when the lunar phase appeared statistically unhelpful			1
anyone who suggested such a thing might be dismissed as moonstruck , or justifiably labelled a complete lunatic .			0

the idea that the moon affects our bodies has long caused controversy
new evidence seems to prove the connection
however , not everyone believes in what 's called the ' @entity63 '
