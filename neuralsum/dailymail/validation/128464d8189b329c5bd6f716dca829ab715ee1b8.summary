however , the firm has confirmed if this is still the case			0
signing on : @entity11 climbs on the table as she signs a document as one of the high profile co-owners of the new service the difference means that @entity117 offers higher sound quality for audiophiles with advanced sound systems - but that casual listeners using simple laptops or smartphones may face slower connections			1
the venue for the event was transformed to display a walkway paying tribute to the different decades in music , starting with the 1950s			0

@entity185 started his fashion career at the tender age of 19 , working with esteemed legends in the industry like stylist @entity209 and @entity210			0
so it only makes sense that the young entrepreneur went on to dress the likes of @entity10 , @entity215 , and @entity12 herself in his unique and innovative pieces			0
