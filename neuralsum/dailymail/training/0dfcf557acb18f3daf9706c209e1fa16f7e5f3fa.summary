more than one million @entity1 customers have been left confused about whether they are one of the 333,000 borrowers to have their loans written off by the controversial payday lender			1
the company announced it would write off £ 220million in debts after regulatory body , the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , revealed it had loaned money to people who could not afford to repay			1
it means that those who have fallen more than 30 days behind with repayments and should never have been given loans will have their debt wiped entirely			1
but borrowers have been left in limbo after @entity1 ’s announcement last week when they were told all customers would be contacted to notify them about whether they will be included in the redress programme			1
the @entity5 told the lender , which quotes an annual interest rate of 5,853 per cent , it had to contact those affected by the end of the day yesterday			1
one customer told the @entity36 he did not know whether he should pay an instalment of his repayment plan or risk accruing more charges if it was deemed he was not entitled to a write - off			2
the payday company said yesterday that it had contacted 375,000 customers by email to let them know what they needed to do next and urged them not to involve a third party with their case			1
in the email from @entity1 to those affected it said the company ‘ will automatically clear any outstanding debt you have with us ’ by the end of october			1
@entity1 's tv adverts , which feature ' pensioner puppets ' , have been criticised by the @entity59 it added : ‘ we recognise that we may not have always made the right lending decisions and for this we apologise			2
we intend to be sure in the future that we only lend to customers who can afford to repay the loans ’			0
customers were also advised they ‘ do not need to do anything ’			0
@entity1 is expected to contact the remainder of its one million customers to let those that have not been affected that that is the case			1
however regulator @entity5 said there is no set timeframe for this , but it is anticipated it will be done as quickly as possible			0
however some borrowers who say they were over the 30 - day arrears period have taken to online forums after they did not hear from the payday lender			1
' @entity78 ' posted on the @entity79 forum : ' i never heard a thing either , 197 days in arrears and still they want £ 1045 off me on a £ 1000 loan ( salary only £ 1200 ) have paid £ 600 back already			1
really thought i would be one of the ones to be wiped			0
' the user explained to forum members that his financial problems began in november when they missed a couple of payments on a credit file			0
they added : ' by march when they lent me the £ 1000 i would have had lots of late payments on my credit card , next account and on my car payments			2
' @entity78 later updated the thread saying they had rung @entity1 and was informed they were not affected by the redress			1
some @entity1 customers who expected to receive an email after being over the 30 - day arrears period say they have been told by the company that they were not affected by the redress ' when i asked why she said she could n't tell and did n't know what criteria had been used and then just read me a scripted response really , ' they added			1
' wonder why they 've deemed me not affected when they lend me 80 per cent of my monthly salary			0
' the user has since said they intend to contact the financial ombudsman about the issue			0
other users said that they were expecting an email from the company , despite the fact their debt had been sold on to a third party			1
it comes after the @entity79 reported that @entity1 would be handling cases ' even if a customer 's debt has been sold on to a third party or they 've entered into an individual voluntary arrangement or debt management scheme			1
' forum user ' @entity132 ' posted : ' @entity1 did sell debts on ... ...			1
. mine sold to @entity136 ( @entity137 ...			0
? ) i have heard nothing - no email or anything			0
' but @entity1 posted on its @entity142 page today that the forbearance programme does not include customers whose debt was sold			1
