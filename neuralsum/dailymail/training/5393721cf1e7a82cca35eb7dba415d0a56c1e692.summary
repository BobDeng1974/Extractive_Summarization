the @entity0 is campaigning for more @entity10 to become livesavers and learn first aid			1
she is pictured here with @entity27 who hosted the @entity11 awards			1
@entity29 saved the life of a man who collapsed in the street ' then she had to run to find someone to call for an ambulance			1
after this she went back to the man and stayed with him until help arrived , ’ said @entity0 , @entity0			1
‘ during all this time not one person stopped to offer assistance			2
thankfully this girl had received first - aid training so she did all the right things			1
‘ so many people seem to walk on by when something happens ; i think the biggest barrier is that without proper first - aid training we think that we might do more harm than good			1
’ her call echoes @entity13 ’s campaign for every schoolchild to be taught first aid			1
the awards were presented by @entity27 at a star - studded ceremony at the @entity56			1

‘ i watched him collapse and quickly ran over , ’ says @entity66 , who had been sent on a first - aid course a few months before through her work at @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76			1
‘ it took me a few moments to work out what was going on and then i started compressions straight away			2
the adrenaline kicked in and i was completely focused on keeping going and saving his life			2
i carried on for 35 minutes , which was pretty exhausting			2
even when the ambulance arrived i carried on as they set up the defibrillator			2
’ @entity66 , 26 , adds : ‘ it was a strange experience but i did n’t have time to stop and think about it at the time			2
' i ’d only done my first aid training really recently and never imagined i ’d have to use it in real life in such a serious situation			1
’ @entity68 went on to make a full recovery and the pair have kept in touch @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 , won the @entity101 for its forward - thinking attitude to teaching first aid			1
all 500 children are given the opportunity to attend first - aid training – starting when they are just four			1

‘ we start with teaching them how to call 999 and by @entity115 they are learning basic cpr , ’ says nursery nurse and first aider @entity111			2
‘ at the beginning they are just bouncing around but they can do it quite competently by @entity121			0
' so many adults do n’t know how to do it but it ’s an essential life skill and i ’d love it to be part of the national curriculum			0
’ @entity111 , right , adds : ‘ it ’s really important to start teaching children first aid from as young as possible			1
’ the school is the first in the country to have an automated defibrillator , which is also available for use by the community			0

she said : ‘ as a mum to two young daughters , i ’ve seen my share of cut knees and bumps to the head			0
but seeing the advert , i realised how serious some childhood accidents can be			0
’ mail on sunday readers voted 15 - year - old @entity29 winner of the @entity158			1
he saved a man who collapsed in the street , despite himself having a congenital heart defect			1
@entity29 had received first - aid training as an @entity163 so he immediately began @entity116			1
‘ because of my heart condition i was worried i would n’t have the strength to perform cpr for long so i showed a woman who was passing by how to do it , ’ says @entity29			1
assistant head teacher @entity168 saved the life of a 15 - month - old boy found face down in a stream			1
@entity168 , 40 , had just arrived at a holiday park for a camping trip with his wife @entity175 , 32 , and children @entity177 , four , and @entity178 , two , when he heard the distressed cries of the toddler ’s family and ran over			0
‘ he was limp and his skin was purple and he looked bloated , ’ says @entity168 , who began cpr while everyone around him was panicking and shouting			0
‘ the family were clearly distraught so i stepped in			0
i feel instantly calm in situations like that and i went on to autopilot ; i knew we had zero time to waste			0
’ @entity168 , right , had learnt cpr after co-coordinating and supervising first - aid classes for his pupils at @entity192 over several years			1
after three minutes of @entity116 , @entity168 had made no progress so he held the toddler upside down to allow some water to come out of his mouth and nose			1
then he carried on with cpr for a couple of minutes until the boy vomited			0
he suddenly heard shallow , gurgling breaths coming from the child			0
he explained : ‘ i did n’t want to carry on in case i caused damage so we put him in the recovery position and put a blanket over him until the ambulance arrived			0

@entity168 describes the events of that day as ‘ the best and worst experience of my life			0
’ he still has flashbacks but imagines it is the lives of his own children he is trying to save			0
‘ having young children myself has made it really hard to come to terms with , ’ he says			1
‘ not having seen the boy or spoken to the family since that day it ’s been difficult to get any closure			0
it still feels very raw			0
’ ‘ we do lots of practice at first aid in @entity234 but i never thought i ’d use it in real life			1
’ @entity29 , who lives in @entity237 with lorry driver father dad @entity238 , 50 , stepmother @entity239 , 44 , who is a shop assistant , sister @entity240 , 17 , step sister @entity241 , 17 and step brother @entity242 , 13 , has @entity244 syndrome			1

@entity276 dialled 999 while @entity277 , 49 , drove them – and the defibrillator – to the meeting room in a different building on the site in @entity294 , @entity295			0
the pair could tell things did n’t look good for @entity279 , whose breathing was ragged and sporadic			2
the 999 operator stayed on the line the whole time and advised them to use the defibrillator			0
‘ i was surprised to have to use it because @entity279 did n’t look like heart attack material			0
he ’s young , not overweight			0
the training kicked in though and we just got on with it , ’ says @entity277 , who lives in @entity303 , @entity304 , with husband @entity305			0
after delivering the first shock to @entity279 , @entity276 carried on with @entity116			0
they were then advised to give him a further shock , after which @entity277 took over with cpr until an ambulance arrived			0
‘ seeing @entity279 looking so much better now is lovely , ’ adds @entity276 , who lives in @entity316 with her 13 - year - old son @entity317			0
‘ i still get very upset at the thought that he might have missed his first father ’s day with his baby son if it had n’t been for the defibrillator			0
