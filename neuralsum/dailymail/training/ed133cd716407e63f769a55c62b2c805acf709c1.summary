' we want to be really careful not to forecast too long term because the determining factors are complete beyond @entity45 's control and prices can change suddenly , but we do n't expect prices to go up any time in the next few weeks			0
' @entity37 spokesperson , @entity36 , said the average price for petrol was likely to drop below $ 1.09 in the next few days an employee from @entity17 in @entity18 told @entity19 that the station , which was selling @entity11 petrol for 99 cents a litre on tuesday and wednesday , had queues of excited people filling their tanks to the top ' they 're all taking pictures and saying they have n't seen it for so long , like for 20 years or something , ' the employee said mr @entity36 said that global factors were driving prices down , adding that independent retailers had a hand in lowering costs due to creating competition in the market			1
' supply is out - shipping demand - we do n't see that very often in the industry , ' he said			0

global factors are driving prices down : ' there is significant production in the @entity77 at the moment and @entity79 are competing by increasing their own production so there is more oil in the market and that 's why it 's so cheap , ' mr @entity36 said ' there also tends to be a lot more traffic going through them [ outer suburbs ] so there 's more volume being sold and more competition than say on the coast of @entity2 where you have more local traffic			2
' on the contrary , mr @entity36 said that the further out of capital cities that commuters travel , the less likely prices would fall , with some areas consistently paying about 20 - 30 cents per litre more than the average price in the city			2
