three caesarean sections had taken their toll on the body of @entity3 , 39 , leaving her overweight and self - conscious about her sagging stomach			1
but when the @entity7 mother flew to the @entity8 for a cut - price tummy tuck , the consequences were worse than she could ever have imagined			1
far from getting the flat tummy she had always longed for , ms @entity3 was subjected to a botch job that left her badly scarred and attached to a shunt for six months			1
botched : @entity3 , 39 , from @entity7 , was left in agony following a badly bungled tummy tuck unhappy : @entity3 had been embarrassed about her flabby tummy - the result of three pregnancies now ms @entity3 , who has since had much of the damage repaired in the @entity20 , has warned of the dangers of travelling abroad for surgery and says she was left feeing like a ' walking , living freak '			1
' i 've got three children , i had three caesarean sections with them and i had this roll of fat that i did n't like - like an apron of skin , ' she explains			1
' i looked around the @entity20 and there was nothing i could afford			2
they were asking from £ 8,000 upwards really			2
' desperate to get rid of the flabby tummy that was making her self - conscious , she decided to look abroad			1
' i found this company in @entity41 and they were a lot cheaper , ' she explains			2
' prices were anything from £ 1,500 to £ 3,000 really			2
' beguiled by the prospect of a cheap tummy tuck , ms @entity3 packed her bags and flew to the @entity8 capital			1
but soon , she realised things were n't quite as they seemed			2
' the accommodation i was supposed to have gone into was n't ready so they dumped me in a hotel , ' she remembers			2
' it was at that point i realised it was going to go wrong			2
' despite her qualms , she decided to go ahead with the surgery			1
' they took me into see the surgeon , ' she says			0
' communication between us was difficult but the agreement was , he was going to cut me from right to left , one scarring , tighten up the stomach muscles , end of story			1
' but when she woke up , she was appalled by the results			0
not only had the surgeon cut right to left , he had also cut top to bottom from her belly button down			1
' i was horrified because it was not what we agreed , ' she reveals			0
' they did n't explain why			0
they just said they had to			0
' after 10 days recuperating in @entity41 , ms @entity3 flew home			1
but things were about to get even worse			0
already suffering from excruciating stomach pain , she had to be rushed to hospital after her scar burst open and a mysterious , painful lump appeared on her side			0
doctors said her skin was no longer attached to her stomach muscles and discovered that the wound had become badly infected			2
roll : ms @entity3 hated the roll of fat left around her middle following three pregnancies damage : she had to be rushed to hospital after her scar burst open and became badly infected scarred : the scars left by the infection and the botched surgery left her feeling like ' a walking , talking freak ' ' they said they had never seen anything like this before , ' recounts a horrified ms @entity3			1
' injuries like this normally come through gunshot wounds - not surgery			1
' they then turned round and told me i 'd have to have a vacuum pump so they could heal me from the inside out			0
' she was attached to the pump for 24 hours a day for the next six months			0
when it was finally removed , her scars were worse than ever and the lump had n't gone away			0
' i hated looking in the mirror , ' she admits			0
' i did n't even like my partner seeing it			0
but i forced myself to look in the mirror to remind me of the stupid mistake i made by going over there			0
' i was a walking , living freak			0
' eventually , two years after the bungled operation that almost destroyed her life , ms @entity3 decided to take action and travelled to @entity139 to see surgeon @entity140			1
big improvement : ms @entity3 has now had a second operation to fix the damage and restore her confidence having gained weight due to the upset caused by the failed tummy tuck , ms @entity3 was told she needed to lose a stone and a half before she could even be considered for an operation			1
astonishingly , she managed to lose the weight in just 10 weeks and finally went under the knife to have the damage repaired			2
during the lengthy operation , dr @entity140 was forced to remove 626g of tissue , including internal scar tissue and the lump itself			0
she also fixed the scars that left ms @entity3 hating her body and completed the tummy tuck the @entity8 surgeon had botched			1
' it 's been a long emotional road , ' says ms @entity3 , who is delighted with her new - look stomach			1
' it 's the end of a book and a new chapter is opening for me			0
' i have so much more confidence than i ever had before			0
it is what i should have had in the first place			0
