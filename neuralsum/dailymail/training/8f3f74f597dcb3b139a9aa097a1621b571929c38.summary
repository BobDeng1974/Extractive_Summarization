by @entity0 published : 20:19 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 20:19 est , 31 october 2013 plans to build the controversial high - speed railway line linking @entity3 to the @entity4 were approved in a @entity6 vote yesterday			1
the @entity7 was passed by 350 to 34 votes , giving a clear @entity10 majority of 316 – despite the efforts of 17 rebel @entity13 mps			1
the @entity14 , which would allow ministers to buy property from residents and businesses on the proposed track route , will now progress to the @entity20 for further scrutiny			1
an artist 's impression of the potential @entity25 train design : the @entity7 , which will release funds for the project , was passed by 350 to 34 votes , giving a clear @entity10 majority of 316 @entity25 was hailed as an ‘ essential ’ railway by @entity30 ahead of the vote			1
he said : ‘ the fact is our @entity35 mainline is full			1
every day between @entity38 and @entity3 there are thousands of people standing on trains that need to be able to sit down and work			1
’ he added : ‘ the question is , do we build an old - style rail line or one of these new - fangled high - speed ones like they are building in @entity46 and @entity47 ? i think we should go for high speed			1
‘ the cost of high speed is only 9 per cent more			1
i hope @entity51 will see sense and stop talking about pulling the plug			1
’ the rebellion is smaller than the 21 @entity13 mps who voted against the @entity14 at second reading			1
@entity51 ’s threats to oppose the bill evaporated last night when they finally hinted they would back it , if the government could rein in the spiralling costs			1
the high speed rail line will only go as far north as @entity63 and @entity64			1
but last night ministers announced a study to try and increase the benefits @entity68 gets from @entity25 , pledging to slash journey times between @entity3 and @entity70 and @entity71 to just three hours			1
travel times between @entity3 and @entity71 or @entity70 are already set to reduce from 3 hours 38 when the final phase of @entity25 is operational in 2032			2
the planned route : the high speed rail line will only go as far north as @entity63 and @entity64			1
but last night ministers announced a study to try and increase the benefits @entity68 gets from @entity25 transport minister @entity79 had instructed @entity25 to improve rail capacity and journey times for passengers and freight to @entity68			1
she said : ‘ @entity68 will already benefit from day one with reduced journey times to and from @entity3 and once the full network is open these times will be reduced by up to an hour			2
however , we want to see if more can be done and so we are commissioning this study			2
’ @entity68 secretary @entity91 said : ‘ today ’s announcement is good news for @entity68			2
the goal of delivering a genuinely national network with high - speed services shows this government is serious about promoting economic growth right across the @entity99			2
’ he added : ‘ tourism on both sides of the border will also be supported as the @entity99 is opened up to faster travel			2
’ the @entity104 approved in the @entity6 yesterday by 350 votes to 34 against will release the funding for the project , if its backed by the @entity20			2
funds will be used to buy property and compensate evicted families along the route , which runs through the picturesque @entity114 countryside			1
@entity13 mps whose constituencies fall along the proposed railway have been largely opposed to the project while others have criticised the spiralling costs , which have already hit £ 50 billion including the cost of rolling stock			2
despite their concerns , only 17 @entity122 ended up rebelling , including former @entity13 leadership hopeful @entity124			2
many sceptics want to hold their fire until parliament votes next year on whether construction can begin			0
opposition : an @entity132 rail project sign stands outside the clubhouse of @entity134 , which sits on the planned route of the rail link , in @entity137			1
many rural communities oppose the development @entity140 , the @entity13 mp for @entity141 , abstained on voting last night , saying : ‘ the case for the project is threadbare and at the moment i ’ll oppose the substantive legislation next year			0
’ despite threats by @entity51 to withdraw their support for the project , the party lined up behind it because the bill is only paving legislation for funding			0
@entity154 transport secretary @entity153 said @entity51 would back the @entity14 after all			0
‘ @entity51 supports @entity25 because we must address the capacity problems that mean thousands of commuters face cramped , miserable journeys into @entity38 , @entity64 , @entity63 and @entity3 , ” she said , outside the @entity6			0
‘ however , government mismanagement has pushed up costs			0
our message to @entity30 is clear			0
get a grip on this project , get control of the budget and get it back on track			0
’ her remarks are in contrast to other signals coming from @entity51 , including from shadow chancellor @entity170 who said he would not be writing blank cheques for the project if @entity51 wins the next election			0
this week it emerged that the expected benefits of @entity25 compared to the costs had been lowered			0
the ‘ benefit - cost ratio ’ was reduced from £ 2.50 to £ 2.30 in benefits for every pound spent			0
this was mostly due to the increase in the total expected cost earlier this year			0
rebels : prominent @entity13 backbenchers @entity185 and @entity124 oppose the @entity25 project @entity185 , conservative mp for @entity187 and opponent of the rail link said the money could be better spent on other projects			0
‘ there are other infrastructural priorities such as housing in our constituencies which are in desperate need and in areas of regeneration , ’ she said			0
@entity25 ‘ actually deprives finance from those valuable projects ’ , she said			0
but fellow conservative and former transport minister @entity201 told @entity203 that @entity204 in @entity205 , which had opposed having the first high speed rail line in its patch was now ‘ begging ’ for a new station			0
the mp for @entity210 said : ‘ there was one town in @entity205 that successfully lobbied not to have a station in its place and that was @entity204 and they stopped it			0
‘ it was put at @entity217 and now they are begging for a station at @entity204 because they are missing out on the regeneration and improvements to the economy that @entity223 and @entity217 are having			0

@entity7 would allow ministers to secure route
it will give them funds and powers to buy property along the way
