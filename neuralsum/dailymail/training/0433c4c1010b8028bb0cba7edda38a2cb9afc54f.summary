action : foreign secretary @entity1 said today that @entity2 could provide experts to help seize the @entity6 government 's chemical weapons stockpiles @entity2 is willing to send experts to @entity6 to help seize its government 's chemical weapons stockpiles but will not send soldiers to protect them , said @entity1 today			1
the foreign secretary said that sending @entity2 troops might ' create strong feelings ' within @entity6 and suggested that alternative security arrangements would be looked at			1
under an agreement between the @entity19 and @entity20 , @entity6 president @entity17 's regime is required to submit a full inventory of its chemical stockpile by the end of the week			1
that 's the first deadline in a timetable to allow international inspectors into the country by november and complete the surrender of its arsenal by mid- 2014			0
it comes after @entity33 inspectors confirmed that said there was ‘ clear and convincing evidence ’ that deadly sarin gas was used in the attack on a @entity40 suburb that killed hundreds of people , many of them children			1
@entity33 secretary - general ban ki - moon said the evidence suggested the incident was the world ’s worst chemical weapons attack for 25 years , when @entity48 used them in @entity50 in 1988 , killing 5,000			1
‘ this is a war crime and a grave violation of international law , ’ mr @entity51 said			0
‘ the results are overwhelming and indisputable			0
the facts speak for themselves			0
’ although the @entity33 report did not say who was to blame , mr @entity1 has said the its findings backed the @entity61 's claims that @entity6 government forces were behind the attack			1
the foreign secretary told the @entity65 today that he now hopes a @entity33 security resolution enshrining the @entity6 regime 's responsibility to hand over its chemical weapons stocks will be drawn up over the weekend			1
asked if @entity2 troops could be deployed to @entity6 , mr @entity1 told @entity72 's today programme : ' no. we will not be sending @entity2 troops into @entity6			1
' not for these or any other circumstances			0
we wo n't be sending boots on the ground , deploying boots on the ground in @entity6			2
' ' i do n't think that would be a good way to provide security inside @entity6 , given that might create strong feelings within @entity6 , so that would have to be provided in a different way			1
' ' @entity87 and convincing evidence ' : professor @entity88 , head of the chemical weapons team working in @entity6 , hands over the report on the @entity93 massacre to @entity33 secretary - general ban ki - moon on the issue of sending @entity2 experts , mr @entity1 said : ' well , we 're open to that			1
we would want to be confident about their security			0
' i think all countries that have expertise in this area should be ready to use it , to deploy it as part of an international team			0
' when asked again on the matter of sending @entity2 experts if there was a requirement , the foreign secretary confirmed : ' we 'd be willing to do so			1
' mr @entity1 said there has to be confidence that the people dealing with the weapons are secure			0
chemical weapons : people walk in a narrow alley past a poster featuring @entity6 president @entity17 in the @entity6 capital , @entity40			2
the @entity33 report into the atrocity does not appear to have apportioned blame he continued : ' of course , all the areas concerned are in regime hands			1
interestingly , given all the debate in the past about whether this was the regime or the opposition , there is no consideration being given to securing chemical weapons held by the opposition because nobody actually believes they 've got any			0
' even the @entity20 are not discussing the declaration and destruction of opposition - held chemical weapons because even they do n't think they really exist			2
' so this is all about places in regime - held territory			2
it should be possible to make security arrangements but again this is a perfectly legitimate question , but that all remains to be sorted out in the coming days			0
' i hope the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) will come to its decision by the end of the week			0
we 'll then be working on agreeing a security council resolution over the weekend			2
' of course , those timetables might slip but we 're looking at days , not weeks			0
' massacre : @entity6 activists inspect the bodies of people they say were killed by nerve gas in the @entity163 region , in the @entity165 neighbourhood of @entity40 , @entity6 earlier the foreign secretary said @entity2 involvement will depend on the arrangements made by the @entity151 and what is agreed at the security council			1
he said : ' we do have experts in these matters in the @entity2			2
when the inspectors went in in the last few weeks , the @entity6 regime would n't agree to have anybody from the @entity2 or the @entity19			1
' questioned on whether the @entity6 regime still has the right to make such refusals , mr @entity1 said : ' that depends on the terms of the resolution , the work of the @entity151			2
' mr @entity1 said he did not think it would be the case that @entity17 could choose who comes to look at his chemical weapons			0
he said : ' but that , of course , is all being sorted out and what he is not able to choose now is whether to declare there 's chemical weapons and to get rid of them			0
' so this is undoubtedly an advance compared to where we were a few weeks ago			0
