under @entity3 - winning president @entity2 , @entity1 's nuclear weapons spending will eclipse $ 1 trillion over the next 30 years as the @entity1 spent more in 2014 on its arsenal than at any time in its history – including during the @entity6 and @entity7 the stunning news from the @entity9 comes just five years after a newly minted @entity2 won the prize for , in part , using international diplomacy to further a ' vision of a world free from nuclear arms			1
' the @entity17 committee wrote just nine months after @entity2 took office that his creation of a ' new climate in international politics ' had already led to ' dialogue and negotiations ' being ' preferred as instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts			2
' ' the vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations , ' @entity2 's award citation read , describing his accomplishments			1
but the @entity9 reported monday on its front page that a massive effort to revitalize and refurbish @entity1 's crumbling nuclear weapons resources has become a spending sprint , catapulting the @entity1 past @entity6 levels			1
but as @entity67 sunk its teeth in new home - district spending opportunities and both @entity70 and @entity71 have seized opportunities to rattle sabers , the atomic reboot has taken on a life of its own			0
as a result , the @entity75 and the @entity76 spent upwards of $ 11 billion this year on nuclear weapons research , development , testing and production			1
that number does n't include any @entity85 spending on aircraft , missile silos or staffing to keep the nuclear button a viable option in the event of a first - strike by one of @entity1 's enemies			1
the @entity95 estimated in 1998 that the entirety of the @entity97 and other spending on nuclear weapons research and production from 1940 to 1945 amounted to $ 30.3 billion , in 2014 dollars			1
that six - year figure is less than the projected @entity1 nuclear spending for each of the next 30 years , according to a january 2014 research paper published by the @entity105 , a graduate school of the far - left - leaning @entity107 in @entity108			1
the ramp - up of spending has left some of @entity2 's early supporters dumbfounded			2
@entity113 ? the 1983 film ' @entity115 ' portrayed nuclear weapons buildups as a sure road to global ruin , but @entity1 has never changed its deterrence strategy cheap : the atomic bomb that leveled @entity122 in 1945 came from a government program that spent less in five years than the @entity1 will spend on its successor in each of the next 30 ageing : @entity1 's nuclear launch facilities are an often - derided throwback to the 1970s , with antiquated computers that spending advocates argue are in desperate need of replacement ' a lot of it is hard to explain , ' former @entity132 @entity1 senator @entity131 told the @entity9			1
' the president 's vision was a significant change in direction			2
but the process has preserved the status quo			0
' but as geopolitics shift , the appetite for weakening @entity1 's offensive weaponry has all but disappeared			1
' the most fundamental game changer is @entity148 ’s invasion of @entity149 , ' @entity144 , @entity2 ’s principal nuclear adviser during his first term added			2
' that has made any measure to reduce the stockpile unilaterally politically impossible			0
' the game changed earlier than that , however			0
the 1.5 million - square - foot @entity155 opened last month after $ 687 million of spending that was authorized in the waning months of the @entity158 presidency			0
' the successful construction of the @entity155 here in @entity39 is part of our broader effort to transform our cold war era infrastructure into a 21st century nuclear security enterprise , ' energy secretary @entity159 said during a dedication ceremony			0
and with that modernization , the @entity1 is pot - committed in the never - ending high stakes poker game that is global nuclear diplomacy			2
change : @entity2 promised to work for nuclear disarmament in 2008 as a presidential candidate -- something that has n't made @entity1 's 21st - century foes budge much crumbling : many of @entity1 's long - range intercontinental ballistic missiles are in dire need of refurbishment , and some of suspected of not being able to perform as intended former deputy energy secretary @entity179 told the @entity9 that ' the whole design of the modernization enables us to make reductions ' in spending in the future			1
the new plant , officials say , will save $ 150 million in energy costs each year			0
that number , however , may be part of an endless stream of pledges from the @entity2 administration that have yet to bear fruit			1
a senior aide to a @entity197 senator who will be involved in budget negotiations for the 2016 fiscal year – a haggling process that will begin in january or february – told @entity201 that there will likely be opposition from both sides of the aisle if @entity2 proposes any kind of cuts			0
' democrats do n't want their 2016 [ presidential ] candidate to have to run on a legacy of weakness , ' he said			0
' @entity215 , in the @entity214 they 've never seen a spending bill they could n't excuse			0
' ' and some @entity197 , ' he offered , ' are still pining for @entity220 's " peace through strength " years from the @entity221 days			0
with @entity148 going crazy , we might need that outlook again			0

the @entity1 spent more in 2014 on nuclear weapons research , development , testing and production than ever , including during @entity7
@entity2 campaigned on shrinking @entity1 's nuclear arsenal
2009 @entity3 *honored* @entity2 for furthering a ' vision of a world free from nuclear arms '
plans call for modernizing @entity1 nuclear weapons to make it better leverage and force the world to shrink arsenals everywhere
but replacing rusting *hulks* of *radioactivity* with modern , computerized weapons systems has become an end unto itself
under the @entity2 administration 's current *policies* , the next 30 years will see $ 1 trillion in new nuclear *defense* spending
