@entity1 manager @entity0 praised the ' world - class ' ability of @entity4 as he revealed that another striker , @entity5 , had delayed talks over his long - term future			1
@entity4 has started the last two games - his first starts in the @entity10 since august - and rewarded @entity0 with a goal in wednesday 's 4 - 0 victory over @entity13 , which sent the @entity15 top of the league			1
@entity5 has not got off the bench in either of those games as he continues to wait for his first goal since november , a barren run that contrasts sharply with his prolific start to his @entity23 career , which saw him net 11 times in 10 matches			1
@entity5 has been in good form this season for @entity1 but has been linked with @entity28 @entity1 are believed to have agreed a fee with @entity30 to sign the striker on a permanent deal at the end of the season but the @entity34 is keeping his options open amid reported interest from @entity28			1
@entity0 , who is ' 100 per cent sure ' that @entity5 will complete his season - long loan , said : ' we 've been speaking with @entity5 for a long time but he 's decided now he wants to wait to see what his options are until march or april , maybe longer , so there wo n't be any final decision this month			1
but we know we have him until the end of the season			2
' the 22 - year - old recently boasted he would hit a hat - trick in the @entity44 semi-final against @entity46 on february 1 but he might not get in the team if @entity4 continues to impress @entity0 against @entity48 in @entity49 on saturday			2
the former @entity51 player had been linked with a return to @entity53 but looks to have won over his sceptical manager			2
@entity0 said : ' there is big competition up front and it 's also about the opponents we meet but @entity4 has made improvement in a lot of things			2
he looks sharper now and needs even more confidence			2
@entity0 is ' 100 per cent sure ' that @entity5 will see out his loan deal with @entity1 ' i believe in him			1
i think he 's a very exciting player and his left foot is world - class , i 've not seen any player have a better left foot in my life			2
' he has skills but again you have to perform over time when you play at @entity1			1
' i would n't play him if i wanted him to leave			0
' we made some demands of him and he has really , really worked hard to tune into that			0
he still needs to improve , everybody does , but he is getting to a new level			0
' you saw yesterday how much he works for the team , how sharp he is , and he scored a very nice goal as well			1
so he is going in the right direction			0
' he has played the last two games and we have won the games and he has played well , so he has in a better position than three or four weeks ago			1
' with the likes of @entity87 and @entity88 returning to fitness , @entity0 is pleased with his options , a situation highlighted by the fact that right - back @entity93 struck two goals against @entity13 on his comeback from a hamstring injury after coming on for @entity98 , who netted against @entity99 in their previous game			1
@entity4 ( right ) heads in @entity104 's second goal during the @entity10 4 - 0 win against @entity13 so he does not appear desperate to sign players in january			1
' in january it 's hard but to keep the players is most important now that we have consistency through the season , ' he said			0
' we 're getting a better level in the team so it 's important to keep it			0
that 's more important than getting players in but if we can add some in as well then it will be perfect			0
' one player @entity0 has missed out on is 16 - year - old @entity120 , who has moved from the @entity123 manager 's former club , @entity124 , to @entity125			0
@entity0 said : ' i met him , but he had some options			0
it was tough choice for him , there were so many clubs			0
' i gave him his debut at 15 years old			0
he is a special , special boy			0

@entity5 scored 11 goals in his first 10 games for @entity1
but the striker has not scored again since november
despite his goal *drought* , @entity28 are reportedly interested in the @entity30 loanee
