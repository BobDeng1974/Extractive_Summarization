only last year , he debuted as a rapping spaceman for the school ’s annual talent show			2
he is seen alongside @entity5 students rapping , singing , and wearing a space - age getup of a white leather jacket and green glow sticks			2
but despite the bouts of silliness , dr @entity4 has an impressive resume – including an @entity61 from @entity62 and a phd in anthropology , also from @entity62 , and received the coveted @entity66 grant in 2003			1
mr @entity3 , speaking from the @entity7 , acknowledged dr @entity4 ’s credentials : ' it is time for a development professional to lead the world 's largest development agency			1

departing : they were also joined by treasury secretary @entity73 ( left ) as mr @entity3 made the announcement at the @entity7 a spokeswoman for @entity111 economist @entity110 said he was withdrawing his nomination in support of dr @entity4			1
' professor @entity110 supports dr @entity72 per cent and with complete enthusiasm , ' spokeswoman @entity114 said			0
the @entity111 has held the presidency since the bank 's inception after @entity119 , and a @entity120 has always headed the @entity99			0
