by @entity0 @entity1 has quit @entity3 @entity2 after one series			0
the pint - sized popstar – who replaced @entity6 as a coach on the singing competition for its third series – has decided to bow out from her role after just one year due to a schedule clash with her upcoming @entity12			1
she wrote on her @entity14 page : ' @entity15 , thanks to all of you for your incredible support throughout this past season of @entity3 @entity2			0
departure : @entity22 has quit @entity3 @entity2 after just one season announcement : @entity22 broke the news to fans via her @entity14 page ' i ’m sad to say that , due to the timing of my @entity29 tour , i wo n’t be back for season 4			1
i absolutely loved my time on the show , and i ’ll miss all of the incredible people who were a part of my experience			0
' i hope to see you all on my @entity12 , and wish continued success to everyone at @entity3 ! ' she added on @entity40 : # lovers , due to timing of my tour i wo n’t be back next season for @entity3 @entity2			2
thanks to all who supported ! hope to see you on my @entity48 tour ! ' the 45 - year - old singer joined the panel with fellow newcomer @entity51 , sitting alongside veteran coaches will.i.am and sir @entity53			1
panel : @entity22 was a judge on the show alongside @entity52 , sir @entity53 and @entity51 belting it out : @entity22 took to the stage with her act @entity59 for the show 's final last saturday night @entity3 producer @entity61 said : ' @entity22 has brought her own very special magic to @entity3 and we have loved having her on the show			1
we wish her well for her tour and hope to welcome her back in the future			0
' @entity22 performed on the final night last weekend with her act @entity59 , but the contest was eventually won by @entity69			1
her decision not to return for the next season comes after the final of the @entity2 show earned the lowest ratings to date - averaging 6.6 million viewers across its two hours , which was down over 600,000 viewers on last year ’s figure of 7.2 million and 2012 ′ s 7.1 million			0
clash : @entity22 cited the main reason for her decision as a clash with her @entity12 the good news though was that the final of the series was significantly up on last week 's series low which only managed to attract 5.9 million viewers			1
yet that 's still almost two million viewers down on the figure that the show started with during the blind auditions of this year 's @entity1 - powered series of @entity3			0
@entity22 stunned fans when she announced last year that she would be joining the judging panel for the @entity97 talent show - after previously having turned down roles on other similar programmes			1
however , explaining her decision to take part in the show , @entity22 said : ' the producers told me all the statistics about how being on the show would boost my record sales , but i ’d heard it all before			2
i said , " that ’s great , but my question is to @entity110 – how has the experience of being a coach on @entity3 impacted on you ? " boost : the addition of @entity22 , seen here in @entity116 earlier this month , to the judging panel helped boost ratings on this year 's show , but they were still disappointing ' he said he learned a lot about himself and how he reacts with his audience , and it ’s true			1
you have no option but to be yourself , and it ’s kind of liberating			0
at the end of a 13 - hour day , when there ’s still all those cameras about , there ’s nowhere to hide			0
you have to let go			0
' it remains to be seen whether will.i , am , sir @entity53 and @entity51 will follow in @entity22 's footsteps or stay on the show for the next season			1
although she ’s quit the @entity138 version , @entity22 is expected to be a coach on the @entity141 version of @entity3 with will.i.am this year			2
