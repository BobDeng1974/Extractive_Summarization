a @entity5 firm has unveiled plans for a radical new cargo ship with a hull so large it acts as a sail			2

the @entity10 , designed by @entity11 , uses a hull designed to act as a giant airfoil the makers of the wind - powered hybrid merchant ship say that while engines are still needed , their design could achieve fuel savings of 60 per cent while reducing emissions by 80 per cent			1
special software will monitor the wind conditions and calculate the best route for the ship			0
the design has a large opening for cargo , and lifeboats that drop from a ‘ lip ’ around the top of the boat if needed			0
the @entity10 , designed by @entity11 , uses a hull designed to act as a giant airfoil			1
its makers say that while engines are still needed , their design could achieve fuel savings of 60 per cent while reducing emissions by 80 per cent the firm also says the design , which draws inspiration from the aerospace industry to create the ' symmetrical airfoil ' hull , could eventually be used for giant cruise ships			1
the company claims the airfoil helps harnesses a force akin to aerodynamic lift , pulling the ship along			1
it would use a liquefied natural gas - powered electrical generator for the remainder of its energy requirements and to get going from a standstill			0
@entity61 says it hopes to license the design to ship builders around the world			2

the firm also says the design could eventually be used for giant cruise ships last month , the world 's largest solar boat - the @entity75 - docked in @entity76 as part of its epic scientific discovery along the @entity80			1
the eco-friendly boat 's crew of nine was collecting data on the sea and atmosphere between the @entity86 and @entity5 as part of an investigation into climate change			0
the impressive vessel crossed the @entity91 in a record breaking 22 days earlier this year when it travelled from @entity93 , @entity94 to @entity95 in the @entity97 catamaran , which is a scientific research platform for the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , has a top speed of 14 knots and has 809 solar panels that can generate up to 480 kwh on a sunny day .			0

a @entity5 firm designed the vessel , which could achieve fuel savings of 60 per cent while reducing emissions by 80 per cent
the @entity108 by @entity11 , uses a hull designed to act as a giant airfoil , which helps harness a force akin to lift to pull the ship along
the firm says the design could eventually be used for giant cruise ships
