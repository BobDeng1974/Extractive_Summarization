' last night 's violence and attacks on police officers were shameful , ' she said today			1
' after success for @entity8 this summer as host to both the @entity125 ( in @entity126 in june ) and the @entity117 , disorder on the streets is a hugely regrettable step backwards			2
' last night 's violence spread from the @entity45 area as the @entity27 parade , which was sanctioned by the @entity134 adjudication body , approached from north @entity3			1
some direct clashes with loyalists and republicans ensued close to the entrance to the unionist @entity140 , and police said they came under attack from both sides , but officers have stressed that loyalist protesters were responsible for the vast majority of the violence			1

' mr @entity179 characterised the violence in @entity45 as ' very severe '			1
' there were all sorts of weapons and equipment being used against police , including scaffolding , masonry , people were pulling up the paving stones from the busiest shopping precinct in @entity3 and were destroying our city and taking that masonry and throwing it at our police officers who put their lives on the line to try and keep people safe			2
' there was nothing lawful about this protest , there was nothing peaceful about it - it was sheer thuggery			0

' but the police did not re-route the parade away from @entity45 and in fact we were within minutes of having @entity45 cleared to allow the parade go through			2
' mr @entity179 added : ' we would call on anyone with any influence to stand up and be counted , actually to show some leadership around what is a difficult set of circumstances for us , but we actually need those with influence within the community to use that for good , so that we do n't resort to the violent scenes that we saw last night			0
