the fast - moving river of air that controls weather over @entity3 and @entity4 is undergoing a dramatic shift that could lead to harsher winters			1
scientists believe the jet stream which girdles @entity9 is increasingly taken a longer , meandering path causing weather patterns to become ‘ stuck ’			1
this could result in longer and harsher winters over @entity4 and northern @entity3 , according to researchers in @entity15			1
the @entity17 's jet stream is a fast - moving belt of westerly winds that traverses the lower layers of the atmosphere			1
experts believe it is taking a meandering path causing weather patterns to get ' stuck ' the jet stream is a ribbon of high altitude , high - speed wind in northern latitudes that blows from west to east			1
it is formed when the cold @entity33 air clashes with warmer air from further south			0
the greater the difference in temperature , the faster the jet stream moves			1
according to @entity40 , a climate expert at @entity42 , the @entity33 air has warmed in recent years as a result of melting polar ice caps			0
this means there is now less of a difference in temperatures when it hits air from lower latitudes			0

the jet stream is formed when the cold @entity33 air clashes with warmer air from further south			1
the greater the difference in temperature , the faster the jet stream moves one of the @entity62 ’s senior experts claims there is no link between global warming and the storms that have battered @entity67 and the @entity54			1
@entity68 , a professor in climate systems at @entity70 , said the storms have been driven by the jet stream which has been ‘ stuck ’ further south than usual			1
professor @entity68 said : ‘ there is no evidence that global warming can cause the jet stream to get stuck in the way it has this winter			1
if this is due to climate change , it is outside our knowledge			0
’ professor @entity68 is also a senior adviser for the @entity85 @entity84 ( @entity84 )			0
his statement appears to contradict @entity62 chief scientist dame @entity87			0
last weekend , she said ‘ all the evidence suggests that climate change has a role to play ’ in the storms			0
professor @entity68 made clear that he believes it is likely global warming could lead to higher rainfall totals , because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water			0
but he said this has nothing to do with the storm conveyor belt			0
‘ the jet stream is a very fast moving river of air over our head , ’ she said on saturday at a meeting of the @entity102			1
‘ but over the past two decades the jet stream has weakened			1
this is something we can measure , ’ she said			0
as a result , instead of circling the @entity9 in the far north , the jet stream has begun to meander , like a river heading off course			1
this has brought chilly @entity33 weather further south than normal and warmer temperatures north			1
perhaps most disturbingly , it remains in place for longer periods of time			2
the @entity67 is currently enduring an especially bitter winter , with the midwestern and southern states experiencing unusually low temperatures			0
in contrast , far northern regions like @entity125 are going through an unusually warm winter this year			2
this suggests ‘ that weather patterns are changing , ’ professor @entity127 said			2
‘ we can expect more of the same and we can expect it to happen more frequently			0
’ temperatures in the @entity33 have been rising ‘ two to three times faster than the rest of the planet , ’ said @entity136 , a weather expert with the @entity138 ( @entity138 )			2
this photograph shows waves crashing into @entity141 in @entity142 on friday night			0
scientists believe changes to the jet stream could create permanent harsher winters professor @entity127 added that it is premature to blame humans for these changes			1
‘ our data to look at this effect is very short and so it is hard to get very clear signal , ’ she said			0
‘ but as we have more data i do think we will start to see the influence of climate change			0
’ the meandering jet steam phenomenon , sometimes called ‘ @entity160 ’ , remains a controversial idea			2
‘ there is evidence for and against it , ’ said @entity162 , director of the @entity163 in @entity164 , @entity165			0
but he said rising @entity33 temperatures are directly linked to melting ice caps			0
‘ the sea ice cover acts as a lid which separates the ocean from a colder atmosphere , ’ mr @entity162 told the conference			2
but if the lid is removed , then warmth contained in the water rises into the atmosphere			0
this warming trend and the shifting jet stream will have a dire impact on agriculture , especially in the farm - rich middle - latitudes in the @entity67			1
‘ we are going to see changes in patterns of precipitation , of temperatures that might be linked to what is going on in the far north , ’ said mr @entity162			2
the main impact on agriculture and livestock will not come from small temperature changes , but rather from temperature extremes and the weather patterns that hold them in place for longer periods of time .			2

the jet stream controls weather over @entity3 and @entity4
over the past two decades , scientists believe the jet stream has weakened
instead of circling @entity9 in the north , the jet stream has begun to meander
this could cause longer and colder winters over the northern *hemisphere*
