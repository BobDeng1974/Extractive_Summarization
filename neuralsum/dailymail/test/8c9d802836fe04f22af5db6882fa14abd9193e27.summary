patients who always see the same gp are more likely to have cancer symptoms missed , research has shown			1
a study found that if doctors know patients well , they could mistake warning signs for ongoing medical problems or depression			0
the study of 18,500 patients found that people with bowel cancer who saw their normal gp were diagnosed , on average , a week later than others			1
patients who always see the same gp are more likely to have cancer symptoms missed , research has shown ( posed by model ) the findings are worrying because @entity23 has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in @entity26 , and this has partly been blamed on family doctors missing symptoms			1
even delays of a few weeks can be vital because the cancer can quickly spread to other organs and become very difficult to treat			1
the study by academics at the @entity35 and @entity36 compared the records of patients diagnosed with breast , lung and bowel cancer between 2000 and 2009			1
the findings , published in the @entity43 , show that seeing the same gp was not linked to a later diagnosis for breast cancer or lung cancer			1
but for bowel cancer – commonly confused with irritable bowel syndrome or piles – there was an average delay of a week			1
researchers said the reason there was no link between breast cancer might be because the symptoms are more obvious			2
and lung cancer is notoriously difficult to detect because there are often no symptoms in the early stages			2
but according to the study , doctors who are ‘ familiar ’ with patients can ‘ misattribute ’ new symptoms to ongoing medical complaints or even depression			0
@entity16 and lead researcher dr @entity67 said : ‘ gps should follow up patients who present with potential cancer symptoms to make sure they receive a timely diagnosis			2
‘ but your regular doctor might not be the best person to spot those symptoms in the first place			0
so in some cases getting a second opinion from a different doctor could speed up the time to diagnosis			0
’ the findings , published in the @entity43 , show that seeing the same gp was not linked to a later diagnosis for breast cancer or lung cancer ( posed by model ) figures last month showed that cancer survival rates in @entity23 lagged ten years behind those of many other @entity26 countries			1
and last summer health secretary @entity89 pledged to name and shame @entity68 who fail to pick up on early warning signs and refer patients for urgent tests			0
dr @entity93 , @entity36 ’s gp expert , said : ‘ these intriguing findings suggest that in some cases a fresh pair of eyes could be better at spotting early signs of cancer			0
anything that can be done to support gps in diagnosing cancer earlier is worth pursuing			0
’ and @entity103 , @entity36 ’s director of early diagnosis , said : ‘ this study provides a useful insight into how seeing the same doctor could impact the time to cancer diagnosis			0
any delay in getting cancer diagnosed has the potential to impact the success of treatment , so it ’s vital we do everything possible to help gps refer patients with potential cancer symptoms without delay			2

bowel cancer patients who saw normal gp diagnosed week later than others , study shows
findings not linked to a later diagnosis for breast cancer or lung cancer
delays can be vital because cancer can quickly spread to other organs
@entity23 has one of @entity26 *'s* lowest cancer survival rates , partly blamed on missed symptoms
