by @entity0 published : 14:08 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 1 november 2013 this is the moment a wallaby was caught on camera hopping around @entity4			1
at first , the footage seems to be a normal shot of the famous graveyard - the burial site of numerous famous figures including @entity10			1
but if you look closely , you can see the creature standing by one of the graves staring right at the camera			1
the footage , taken on monday , then continues to follow the wallaby while it skulks around , hopping between the bushes and around gravestones of the westerly area of the cemetery			1
the creature goes on quite the tour - and explores a fair amount of the @entity37 registered site			1
eventually , it hops off down a gravel road and out of site			0
visitor and volunteer coordinator @entity41 said someone first saw the marsupial , which belongs to the same family as the kangeroo , on sunday			1
she said : ' it ’s quite extraordinary and so unexpected			0
' @entity48 is quite secure so it ’s a mystery how he got in there but now he ’s in , it ’s quite a good place to be as he wo n’t be crossing the roads			2
' @entity55 , a documentary maker who lives next door to the cemetery , heard about the unexpected visitor			1
explore : in the footage , filmed by documentary maker @entity55 , the animal hops among the bushes adventure : the marsupial then hops off to have a peak around some of the 53,000 graves at the burial site mr @entity55 , who is also a zoologist , managed to film the creature for around two minutes			1
he said : ' i live right next to the cemetery and when i heard there was a wallaby i was straight round			2
' i saw some pictures that visitors had taken during the day on sunday but i did n't see the animal myself			2
' i went back the next day and there it was - hopping around			2
' it is quite odd			0
apparently they do live in packs wild across the country , however strange that seems			0
' i do n't think it is alone either			0
i later saw a wallaby but it looked different somehow - so perhaps there are two of them			2
i ca n't be sure though			0
' i heard someone had seen a wallaby in the park too			2
' visit : the animal , seen next to the tree in this shot , was first spotted on sunday by visitors to the @entity37 site who took pictures of the unusual event extraordinary : mr @entity55 said the wallaby 's visit was odd - and that he thought it may not have been alone last week , a man claims to have seen a wallaby in @entity111 , near @entity112 , also in @entity4			1
@entity113 managed to take a blurry photo of the creature before it ran away			0
mr @entity55 said he contacted numerous local zoos - and none of them were missing a wallaby			1
nearby @entity121 homes wallabies but a spokesperson said that none of their animals had escaped in recent years			0
@entity125 in @entity126 also confirmed that none of their animals had escaped			0
not alone : the sighting follows news that another wallaby was seen on @entity112 last week i 'm off : eventually , the creature makes its way down a gravel path and out of site the @entity135 , which runs the @entity112 , said that there had been no official reports of wallaby sightings			1
a spokesperson said : ' we have n’t spotted any wallabies though there may be a few @entity143 lurking around			0
' we ’ve had no unusual sightings in recent times so it seems this is a case like the @entity148 , more imagined than actual reality			0
' wallabies belong to the same family as kangaroos , though they are much smaller , and are native to @entity143 .			0

marsupial first spotted on sunday in @entity4 , north @entity18
film maker @entity55 took the *remarkable* footage on monday
sees creature casually hopping between the graves and around bushes
follows another wallaby sighting near @entity112 last week
mystery continues as no local zoos are missing one of the creatures - which are from the same family as the kangaroo
