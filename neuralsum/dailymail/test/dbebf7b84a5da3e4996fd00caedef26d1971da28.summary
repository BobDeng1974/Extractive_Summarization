you probably wo n’t realise they are coming until it ’s too late			0
tiny robots , the size of an @entity5 sheet , are being programmed to lift cars that are up to two tonnes in weight			2
working together , these creepy machines are able to sneak up unnoticed and silently remove their target from the scene			0
tiny robots , the size of an @entity5 sheet , are being programmed to lift cars that are up to two tons in weight the robots , collectively called @entity15 , are the creation of a @entity18 consortium led by the @entity19 in @entity20			1
a ‘ @entity22 ’ ( @entity15 ) computer first selects a vehicle to be moved after cameras have mapping the area in detail			1
the @entity15 system then works by sending a deployment unit to scan the area again and identify new potential obstacles			1
once this has been done , bogies deploy from the depolyment unit and are tracked to a target vehicle , where they dock onto the wheels and lift the car			1
the robots , collectively called @entity15 , are the creation of a @entity18 consortium led by the @entity19 in @entity20 these bogies are fitted with on - board sensors , including two lasers and a digital camera			1
the sensors help the @entity15 tool move the vehicle without human intervention , while avoiding obstacles			1
while the system may seem creepy , it could have important applications for bomb disposal teams			1
researchers envisage the system being used by the police to remove suspicious vehicles , potentially rigged with explosives , from within buildings			1
‘ current methods of bomb disruption and neutralisation are hindered in the event that the device is shielded , blocked or for whatever reason can not be accessed for examination , ’ the researcher wrote on their site			2
@entity67 ceo @entity66 revealed a terrifying glimpse of the future - a swarm of robot spiders @entity67 has shown of a terrifying glimpse of the future - a swarm of robot spiders that can be controlled with a flick of the wrist			0
at the chip giant 's developers forum in @entity78 , @entity67 ceo @entity66 revealed the demonstration to show off the firm 's button sized computed and controller wristband			0
he was able to cause lights on the robots to change shape , and control their movement from the bans			2
the robots were powered by @entity89 , a computer the size of a button developed by @entity67			2
' the @entity95 module is a tiny hardware product based on the @entity98 system chip , which is the company 's first purpose - built system on a chip for wearable devices , ' the firm said			0
it contains @entity104 low - energy radio , sensors and battery charging technologies			0
@entity66 said that there 's a dedicated sensor hub processor and pattern classification engine that allows it , for example , to identify different sporting activities quickly and precisely			0
‘ @entity15 can provide an autonomous capability to remove blocking vehicles which is not currently available			1
’ other uses could include removing cars parked in a tight spot or helping vehicles move within a car park without a driver			2
the team has been working on the technology since 2012 and believes a production model could be ready by next year			0
they will be showcasing the system at the upcoming @entity125 ( @entity126 ) on may 26th to 30th in @entity127			0
working together , these creepy machines are able to sneak up unnoticed and silently remove their target the team has been working on the technology since 2012 and says a production model could be ready in 2016			0

the robots , collectively called @entity15 , are attached to a deployment unit
unit is used to scan the area for obstacles and plan a route to the car
it then releases bogies which travel to the car and dock onto the wheels
system may help bomb disposal teams deal with suspicious vehicles
