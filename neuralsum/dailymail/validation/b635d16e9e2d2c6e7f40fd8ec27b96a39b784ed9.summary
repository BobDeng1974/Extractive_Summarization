' my family has a vineyard and winery in @entity39 so i grew up in the wine making industry			2
' once i was old enough to help , i asked why we spend so much time filling small barrels of wine for oak ageing versus pouring it all into a giant barrel like we do the fermentation tanks			2
' the answer , my father told me , was the smaller the oak barrel we use the faster the oak infusion and the faster we can achieve the desired oak tannin we are looking for in our wine			0
' the best wines spend years ageing in oak barrels he then spent three years developing the @entity44 , which he claims is the ' smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made '			0
