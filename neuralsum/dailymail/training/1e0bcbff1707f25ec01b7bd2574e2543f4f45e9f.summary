@entity1 's deputy president @entity0 pointed out the group of whites as proof that the @entity5 appealed beyond its core black constituency @entity1 's ruling @entity5 has been accused of bribing poor white people to attend a party rally in an attempt to bolster its multi-racial credentials			1
the @entity5 's alleged ' hire a white ' scheme was exposed after more than a 100 poor white people sat in the front few rows of a political rally in the north of the country			1
speaking at the conference , on saturday , @entity1 's billionaire deputy president @entity0 pointed out the group of whites as proof that the @entity5 appealed beyond its core black constituency			2
' this is the proof [ we are ] the party for everyone ' , he said			0
despite it being 19 years since the end of apartheid in @entity1 , the country remains divided by race , especially when it comes to politics			0
photographs of saturday 's @entity5 rally in the @entity34 town of @entity35 showed the small group of white people sitting together at the front of a large marquee which was otherwise filled with black people			1
the pictures showed how many of the white people at the rally had pulled yellow @entity5 t - shirts featuring pictures of @entity1 's president @entity46 over their normal clothes			2
despite this show of apparent support for president @entity46 , some of the whites in the t - shirts told a local newspaper that they did not know who he was			0
the @entity57 language @entity55 newspaper reported that many of the group seemed ' confused ' , saying they only attended the rally in order to obtain free food parcels			1

although @entity1 's ruling @entity5 is overwhelmingly popular among the country 's blacks - who make up 80 per cent of its population - it struggles for votes among the country 's other apartheid era race groups : namely whites , @entity76 and mixed race people			1

@entity1 president @entity46 ( left ) with deputy @entity0 , pictured last year in recent years some black voters have abandoned the party of liberation in frustration with high levels of corruption and unemployment as they have started to desert the party - whose figurehead @entity91 became the country 's first black president in 1994 - the @entity5 has started to look for support elsewhere			0
it appears to have turned @entity1 's small population of poor , rural , @entity57 - speaking white people , some of whom may sympathise with the party 's message of fighting exploitation with strong labour laws			2
@entity103 , a local @entity5 politician with responsibility for minorities denied that the white delegates were part of a ' hire - a - white ' election strategy or that the group had been promised food parcels			1
she explained that some of them may not have know who president @entity46 was because they were too poor to have access to the media			0
she went on to claim that many white @entity1 support the @entity5 .			2
