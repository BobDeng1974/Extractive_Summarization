confused , she eventually pulled over on the @entity33 at @entity34 in @entity35 , around 60 miles north - east of @entity27 , for a coffee in the early hours of the morning			2
when she left the service station - after nearly 19 hours on the roads - she accidentally drove back down the carriageway she had arrived on - into the oncoming traffic			1

lost : @entity7 , 83 , should have got to @entity18 from her home in just three hours but got very confused - and ended up near @entity27 ' on the dual carriageway she realised that she was going the wrong way so she moved to the lane alongside the central reservation trying to find a gap			1

' when she was stopped , she confirmed she knew she had been travelling the wrong way			0
' she was asked why she had not turned around and she replied " because i did not want to go that way "			0
