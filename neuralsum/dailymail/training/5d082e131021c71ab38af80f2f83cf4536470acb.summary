this lane is only 6ft wide and has a sign to warn off larger vehicles , so you might have thought truck drivers would steer well clear			1
but to the dismay of resident @entity6 , some just blindly follow their satnavs – getting themselves stuck and damaging her beautiful @entity10 - listed home			1
she estimates that lorries have so far caused around £ 50,000 damage to her side and garden walls , and to her neighbour ’s wall on the opposite side			1
they ignore the evidence of their own eyes that it ’s too narrow and just carry on until they get stuck ‘ the worst incident happened in 2008 when a big lorry got stuck then tried to ram its way down , costing £ 13,000 in repairs			1
' there have been so many incidents , i ca n’t remember them all			0
several have caused £ 5,000 damage			1
' i ’ve started claiming off my own insurance because it was so slow claiming third party from the driver ’s insurance			0
‘ it ’s heartbreaking because as soon as something is repaired it ’s just a matter of time before it gets damaged again			0
’ in the past week three motorists ran into trouble on the small , narrow lane in @entity63 , @entity64 over the years ms @entity6 said around £ 50,000 worth of damage has been done to her home and grounds sometimes the homeowner does not even have the chance to see the culprit , and they get out of the situation ' scot free ' ms @entity6 ( left ) is pleading with council officials to make signage before the turn down the lane more obvious ( right ) there is a sign at the top of the lane in @entity63 , near @entity81 , @entity64 , warning drivers of the width restriction			1
but miss @entity6 , who has lived there for 23 years , wants the council to make it more prominent			1
three trucks have got stuck in the last week alone , she said			2
one driver had to get in and out of the cab through a window while they waited four hours for a rescue vehicle to arrive			0
garden designer @entity93 added that she believes the problem is partly down to some drivers still using domestic satnavs designed for cars , rather than specialist satnavs for commercial vehicles			2
‘ i ’m told the commercial ones do carry warnings about the lane ’s width but the domestic ones do n’t , ’ she said			0
' sometimes i ’ve come home and the damage has been done and the driver has gone and got away scot free			0
' luckily i ’ve got a neighbour who works from home who can now get the driver details of most incidents when they happen			0
' but i ’ve started claiming off my own insurance because it was so slow claiming third party from the driver ’s insurance - things would drag on and on because it was lower priority			0
the homeowner has lived at the property for 23 years and has faced ' countless ' problems , she says despite hearing from council representatives , little is being done to solve the problem in @entity63 , @entity64 council officials say the road signs are obvious enough despite repeated incidents			1
three motorists in just one week have had trouble at the site ms @entity6 said drivers of lorries and vans should pay more attention to the road than to their sat nav on one occasion a driver caused £ 33,000 worth of damage after getting stuck in the lane and damaging the wall the council said the sign is clearly marked enough though ms @entity6 says more needs to be done ' last monday we had a big sewage tanker , with an escort to make sure it travelled safely , and it took him half - an - hour to reverse out			1
' then on wednesday night someone collided with our low wall which stops vehicles coming off the lane and into our courtyard			2
' another guy was trapped for six hours			0
if only truck drivers used their common sense as the lane got narrower and narrower			2
' you would think they ought to know better			0
' ' there needs to be more prominent signage at the top of the lane			1
' i ’ve had visits from council representatives who are sympathetic and make all the right noises but nothing ever gets done			2
' it ’s heartbreaking because as soon as something is repaired it ’s just a matter of time before it gets damaged again			0
' a spokesman for @entity175 council said there were enough warnings in place to avoid lorries getting stuck in the lane			1
' there are already signs in place at this location and we recommend drivers pay attention to these			0

@entity6 has lived in cottage in @entity63 for 23 years
@entity192 has ' lost count ' of times drivers have become stuck in lane
calling on council officials to make signage at top of road more obvious
ms @entity6 says crashes to her wall have caused £ 50,000 in damage
