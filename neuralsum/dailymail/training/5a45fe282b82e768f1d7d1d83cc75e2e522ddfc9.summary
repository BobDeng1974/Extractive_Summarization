a few nifty tricks will allow you to access @entity3 bargains from the comfort of your own home from cheap computers to half - price clothes and huge savings on cameras , we ’re forever hearing how much less goods cost across the @entity12			1
yet while few of us can afford to jet off to @entity3 for a @entity16 shopping spree , there is a way to access those bargains and save huge sums — all from the comfort of your sofa			1
for although online shopping overseas sounds daunting — and is not as simple as just redirecting yourself to @entity3 websites — with a few nifty tricks you could save yourself thousands of pounds , especially on big - ticket electronic items			1
and that ’s even when adding postage and tax costs			0
take a digital slr camera , for example			1
one of the best and most popular on the market now is the @entity33 , which on the @entity35 version of @entity36 costs a whopping £ 4,499 new , plus £ 6.15 postage			1
but find yourself on the @entity3 site of @entity36 and you can pick it up for £ 2,369 — nearly half the price			1
even when you ’ve added on taxes , shipping and duty — upping the total to £ 3,009.70 — you still pay £ 1,495.45 less			0
elsewhere , an @entity48 from the @entity3 , with taxes and postage added , would cost £ 444.98 from @entity51 , compared with £ 479 from @entity52 in the @entity35			1
you can end up with a @entity54 cardigan and @entity56 ’s jeans for half price			1
such are the savings — and the ever - easier buying process — more people are shopping and shipping abroad			2
and there is still time to order and receive goods in time for @entity16			0
‘ with online retail we ’re seeing geographical boundaries breaking down , ’ says @entity63 , founder of fashion aggregation site @entity65			0
those clothes items are often on sale for the same figure in dollars as in @entity35 pounds , making them around 50 per cent cheaper in the @entity3			1
’ that is why most international companies make it difficult to shop from their @entity3 sites and automatically redirect visitors from the @entity35 to a website specifically for the @entity35 market			1
but there are ways round this			0
for some , such as @entity36 , it ’s as simple as changing the ending of the web address to @entity36 on the address bar			1
for others , such as @entity52 , the more complex web address will include the letters ‘ en ’ , as in ‘ @entity98 ’ — try changing that to ‘ @entity3 ’ and you may find yourself on the @entity3 site			1
in most cases though , it ’s a question of looking at the top and bottom of the homepage for a tiny @entity108 flag or the words ‘ @entity35 ’			2
near these should be the option to change your territory to ‘ @entity3 ’ or to click on an @entity3 flag			2
huge savings can be made on expensive electronic products such as the @entity48 by buying them on @entity3 websites once you have found the correct site and currency , remember that operations abroad do not always work the same as in the @entity35			1
when calculating prices you should remember that in many states , sales tax is added at the checkout rather than marked on the selling price			0
‘ even if you ’re buying through an @entity132 seller that looks great , you ’re often still going to have to pay duty , so be careful buying abroad unless the pricing is absolutely transparent , ’ says consumer expert @entity127 , who works with the government ’s online safety campaign @entity128			0
for goods sold within the @entity3 tax varies from state to state and is generally calculated after you ’ve added your delivery address , because it usually depends on which state the item is being delivered to			1
the highest is 9.4 per cent in @entity143 , while shipping to @entity144 or @entity145 carries no sales tax at all			0
while delivering direct to the @entity35 might seem a better option , many @entity3 companies will deliver only to a @entity3 address and insist you use an @entity3 credit card			1
but you can get around this by using a shopping and shipping site , which will handle the transaction and delivery on your behalf — then send the goods to the @entity35			2
this is when the @entity3 state taxes become important			2
one reputable service is @entity161 , which is free to subscribe to after a $ 10 ( £ 6 ) joining fee and gives you what is effectively a @entity165 for your deliveries			0
this is in @entity168 , meaning a middle - ground 6 per cent sales tax			0
it also provides a ‘ personal shopper ’ service , which can place orders on your behalf to avoid the need for an @entity3 credit card			2
it will also check orders when they arrive to make sure they are undamaged , sort out the tax and @entity35 customs payments , and deal with any paperwork , such as that needed to transport hazardous materials , which include the lithium batteries in laptops or flammable products such as nail polish			1
it then puts your packages into one parcel to send to you , potentially saving hundreds of pounds on shipping packages individually			0
it will not deal with certain major issues , however , such as negotiating items that could be considered a threat to national security , like advanced electronics and firearms			0
the double delivery means you must allow time for a product to reach @entity161 — for @entity52 , that is two days — and time for it to ship from its depot to the @entity35			2
that ’s an average of three days , though over the @entity16 period its fastest courier , @entity207 , says december 18 is the final day for shipping to the @entity35			2
although online shopping overseas sounds daunting - and is not as simple as just redirecting yourself to @entity3 websites - with a few nifty tricks you could save yourself thousands of pounds that means tomorrow is the last day on standard delivery within @entity3 , though some @entity3 firms have same - day or one - day delivery , which may extend your window			1
it ’s still down to you to check whether the @entity3 saving really does add up once taxes , shipping costs and also custom duties have been added			1
if you have goods delivered to the @entity35 you must also pay duty and import vat on anything over £ 135			2
while this can be quite complicated and differs depending on the type of item and price range , services such as @entity228 will work the charges out and some sites , such as @entity235 , calculate it at the checkout			0
for example , on a @entity76 handbag with a @entity3 price of £ 142.57 ( @entity240 ) , sales tax at 6 per cent is around £ 8.55 , shipping is £ 35.08 , duty is 4 per cent , so £ 5.70 , and import vat is 20 per cent , around £ 28.51 — all told about £ 220 , compared with £ 285 in the @entity35			1
further details of the duty on different items can be found at @entity250			0
just remember to check these factors first , or you could pay more despite lower prices			0
the @entity35 price for the 11in @entity255 macbook air is £ 899 , compared with £ 699.50 from the @entity257 in the @entity3			1
yet by the time you ’ve added sales tax , shipping and @entity35 duty , the actual cost is £ 925.30 — £ 26.30 more			2
the only way round this is to wait for a sale or try a discount dealer such as @entity268 , which has macbooks for $ 100 less			0
and not all items will have guarantees			0
@entity52 has an international warranty on many products but not on @entity274 , because they are bought with a service provider			0
the same applies to cellular @entity276 , which are not likely to be covered , while wifi @entity276 are			0
you can get refunds , but this can be complicated and expensive			0
as services such as @entity284 check products for damage , you can send products back before they leave the @entity3 , however			0
sometimes savings may seem small , but if you bulk - buy , you can consolidate shipping prices , making it possible to save thousands on a big spree			1
that could make it ideal for those doing @entity16 shopping in one go — without all the jet - lag .			0

shoppers can save thousands of pounds on big - ticket electronic items
@entity303 digital slr camera costs nearly half in @entity3 what it does in @entity35
most companies make it difficult for people to shop from their @entity3 sites
but there are simple *solutions* such as changing the end of web address
