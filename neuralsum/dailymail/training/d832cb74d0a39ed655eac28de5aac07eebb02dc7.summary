@entity0 or @entity1 ? the man who has never lost a foursomes match on @entity5 soil or the rock of so many @entity8 victories ? the man with a brilliant singles record and the only player to have competed in four @entity12 and never been on a losing side ; or the golfer who is an inspirational figure both on the course and in the team room ? that , i believe , should be the incredibly difficult choice facing @entity5 ’s captain @entity21 on tuesday on what promises to be an intriguing wildcard occasion on both sides of the @entity25			1
for @entity21 , it ’s a @entity27 in every sense with his three - card trick being broadcast to the nation at midday , while his opposite number @entity32 ’s choices follow on around midnight ( @entity35 time )			1
let us start with @entity21 , and the four players in the frame for the three precious spots : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity0 and @entity1			1
on paper , you would go for the three englishmen every time , and never mind that the match is being played 34 miles from @entity41 ’s home at @entity47			1
the trio have got the @entity8 medals to prove it , and few captains ever bestow a pick on debutants			2
tough to split : @entity21 may have to choose between @entity1 and @entity0 for the @entity8 tough choice : @entity0 is among four @entity55 in the running to make captain @entity21 's @entity5 team out of form : veteran and @entity8 inspiration @entity1 is n't in good touch coming into the clash with the @entity63 but the problem @entity21 faces is the palpable fact that all three englishmen are hopelessly out of form			1
@entity40 has garnered fewer world ranking points this year than any other player in the top 40 except the injured @entity69			2
@entity1 did not even make the top 100 who were eligible for the second @entity73 event that finished in @entity63 on monday night , while @entity0 has not had a single high finish all summer			1
going into a @entity8 with a quarter of your team misfiring to this extent in regular tournaments would surely be placing far too much value on experience over form and constitute a gamble veering towards the reckless			1
@entity41 , meanwhile , has gathered more world ranking points than @entity0 and @entity40 combined			1
the match is being played on @entity5 soil and in his last four @entity5 starts he has finished tied fourth , tied 15th at @entity89 , tied seventh , and third at the @entity91 open on sunday			2
he finished so close to making it by right - just 1.16 points behind ninth - placed @entity95 - it ’s no wonder there is such a clamour for @entity21 to make an exception in this instance and bestow a wildcard on a rookie			1
mr @entity8 : @entity40 's won his last seven @entity8 matches and was an inspiration at @entity106 rookie : @entity108 's @entity41 has more world ranking points than @entity0 and @entity40 combined wildcard contenders age : 38			1
this season : @entity113 does n’t begin to cover it , with injuries playing a big part			0
why he should be picked : seriously ? after what happened at @entity106 ? why he should n’t : inconceivable that captain @entity21 would n’t pick ‘ mr @entity8 ’			1
this season : top - 15 finishes at two majors and a win in @entity126			0
why he should be picked : never let @entity5 down in all those eight matches			2
why he should n’t : can he still hole the big putts when vital points are on the line ? age : 36			0
this season : runner - up in @entity137 event and tied third in @entity5 ’s flagship event			2
why he should be picked : @entity5 ’s best putter and wonderful @entity8 record			1
why he should n’t : coming off the most disappointing summer of his career			0
this season : wonderfully consistent , and beat @entity148 to win in @entity149			0
why he should be picked : fabulous ball striker , and hometown hero			0
why he should n’t : lacks experience			0
can he handle the unique atmosphere ? there is one other factor that ought to be considered as well , for you do not have to be a rabid advocate for @entity108 independence to wonder what effect it would have on the atmosphere if @entity21 went for three out - of - form englishmen over the hometown hero			1
alongside @entity41 , the case for @entity40 is unanswerable			1
how could you possibly leave out the man who has won his last seven @entity8 matches and turned the last contest at @entity106 in @entity5 ’s favour almost single - handedly ? just to complete the picture , @entity40 was playing average golf going into previous @entity12 and still delivered			1
so that leaves @entity0 or @entity1			1
waiting for @entity0 is the perfect foursomes partner in his great friend , the revitalised @entity172			2
waiting for @entity1 would be 11 team - mates who all look up to him and recognise his contribution to @entity8 lore			1
helping @entity1 ’s case is the fact one of @entity21 ’s assistant captains is @entity179			1
he is one of @entity1 ’s closest golfing buddies and already on record as saying he believes he should be in the team			2
in the hot seat : @entity21 will make his call on the final three wildcards for @entity5 on tuesday @entity5 already qualified : @entity148 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity172 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity95			1
three wildcards to be added			0
@entity196 : @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200			0
already qualified : @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209			0
but the thing that might prove pivotal in this marginal decision is the fact @entity1 has shown glimpses of his true form this summer			2
there was a special round of 63 to close out the @entity217 at @entity218 and three rounds in the 60s - including one of 65 in the first round - at the @entity222			0
from @entity0 , alas , the magic has been missing			2
still , leaving out the match play specialist , and perhaps the best putter in @entity5 golf ? one thing is for certain : whoever gets the call will be under immense pressure to justify his selection			2
as for the @entity63 , @entity32 has had a good three weeks following his embarrassing uncertainty regarding @entity69 , when even a fool could see @entity69 was not in any fit state to play			0
since then , @entity194 has stepped up to the plate and will resume his formidable partnership with @entity205 , as has @entity195 , who will be burning to make amends for his fatal mistake against @entity95 in their singles match at @entity241 in 2010			0
miracle at @entity106 : ( from left ) @entity189 celebrates last year 's @entity8 win @entity1 , @entity0 and @entity40 regarding the third spot , that could well be determined by events at the @entity246 in @entity247 late last night , where a clutch of young @entity63 had the ideal opportunity to impress against @entity148			1
it should be some @entity251 tuesday			0
quote of the week ‘ i do n’t think he needs a swing coach			0
if i were advising him , i ’d tell him : “ you ’re the greatest player that ever lived , just go to the range and hit shots ”			0
’ @entity259 , the best coach @entity69 ever had , offers some sound advice in the wake of @entity69 ’s not - so - shocking split from his most recent guru , @entity264			0
second chances in life are rarely so profitable or joyous as @entity267 ’s on the senior circuit			0
an overwhelming 10 - shot triumph at @entity270 on sunday in the @entity271 was his third victory of a season that has also seen him claim two senior majors and has taken the 51 - year - old @entity276 ’s earnings to loose change short of $ 2million			0
by my calculations , that places him just above the amount mustered by @entity189 for seventh place in the race to @entity149			0
it 's not too late to play @entity285 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity1 and @entity0 are in *weakest* position *ahead* of @entity8
@entity21 must choose three wildcards to complete his @entity5 team
@entity40 and @entity41 most likely to be given a place
@entity21 will make his *announcement* at midday on tuesday
2014 @entity8 takes place at @entity47 , @entity108 , on *september* *23* - 28
@entity5 are *defending* champions after winning at @entity106 in 2012
