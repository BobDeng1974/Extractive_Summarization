where there is muck there really is brass with scientists claiming that millions can be made by extracting gold from human waste			1
in fact as well as gold , faeces contains platinum , silver and other metals along with rare elements such as palladium and vanadium			1
researchers now hope to ' mine ' sewage reducing the need to mine raw metals from the ground , while reducing pollution by recycling human waste			2
scientists have discovered a literal goldmine of precious metals in human @entity29 @entity28 researchers are investigating ways of flushing out the valuable minerals , including gold , silver and rare elements such as palladium and vanadium			1
pictured are microscopic gold - rich and lead - rich particles in human waste taking a lesson from industrial mining , the scientists are experimenting with chemicals called leachates that are used to pull metals out of rock			1
some of these chemicals have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment			0
but in controlled conditions , they could safely be used to recover metals from treated solid waste , dr @entity46 claims			2
in the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum , silver and gold observing microscopic - sized metal particles in biosolids			1
previous research estimated the waste from one million @entity28 could contain as much as $ 12 million ( £ 8.7 million ) worth of metals			1
in 1999 the @entity61 produced over 1,130,000 tonnes of sludge dry solids , which averages to about 20kg generated by each person			2
if @entity61 's waste was mined it could be worth $ 762 million ( £ 510 million ) a year			1
dr @entity46 of the @entity68 said : ' if you can get rid of some of the nuisance metals that currently limit how much of these biosolids we can use on fields and forests , and at the same time recover valuable metals and other elements , that 's a win - win			1
' there are metals everywhere			0
they are in your hair care products , detergents , even nanoparticles that are put in socks to prevent bad odours			0
' yet all end up at the sewage works and many metals end up in the leftover solid waste			2
at treatment plants , wastewater goes through a series of physical , biological and chemical processes and the end products are treated water and biosolids			0
in the @entity28 alone seven million tons are leftover each year with half used as fertiliser on fields and in forests and the other half incinerated or sent to landfills			1
dr @entity46 added : ' we have a two - pronged approach			0
' in one part of the study , we are looking at removing some regulated metals from the biosolids that limit their use for land application			0
if @entity61 's waste was mined it could be worth $ 762 million ( £ 510 million ) a year			1
previous research estimated the waste from one million @entity28 could contain as much as $ 12 million ( £ 8.7 million ) worth of metals			1
' in the other part of the project , we 're interested in collecting valuable metals that could be sold , including some of the more technologically important metals , such as vanadium and copper that are in cell phones , computers and alloys			2
' the study aims to use the same chemicals , called leachates , which the mining industry uses to pull metals out of rock			0
while some of these leachates have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment , in a controlled setting , they could safely be used to recover metals in treated solid waste			0
in the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum , silver and gold observing microscopic - sized metal particles in biosolids using a scanning electron microscope			2
' the gold we found was at the level of a minimal mineral deposit ' meaning if that amount were in rock , it might be commercially viable to mine it			0
dr @entity46 added that ' the economic and technical feasibility of metal recovery from biosolids needs to be evaluated on a case - by - case basis			0
' the study presented at the 249th @entity166 of the @entity167 ( @entity167 ) involved collecting samples from small towns in the @entity170 , rural communities and big cities			0
for a more comprehensive picture , they plan to combine their information with many years ' worth of existing data collected by the @entity177 and other groups at the @entity68 .			0
