breakthroughs in @entity4 could ‘ threaten our humanity ’ by prompting parents to demand designer babies , @entity0 has warned			1
the fertility pioneer said that he feared a time when the rich could alter the appearance and ability of children by tinkering with their genes			1
and he claimed a ‘ toxic ’ climate had been created by the desperation of childless couples and the pace of scientific developments in the booming ivf industry			1
warning : @entity21 fertility expert professor @entity0 warns that recent breakthroughs in @entity4 treatment technology could encourage gene manipulation of foetuses warning of a resurgence in eugenics , the broadcaster and @entity28 peer said there was a ‘ real risk that we could see that kind of attitude in our humanity occurring again ’			1
in the future , he claimed , the rich may be able to pay to have babies with enhanced intelligence , musical ability and strength			1
lord @entity0 ’s comments will be hugely controversial among fertility experts , not least because he is a pioneer in @entity4 treatment and has helped to bring more than 10,000 babies into the world			1
medical ethicists last night praised him for speaking out , saying it was refreshing to hear a scientist who ‘ saw the bigger picture ’ about the potential dangers			0
but his comments angered fertility groups			2
they said @entity4 was a ‘ lifeline ’ and it was wrong to suggest childless couples were looking to have a designer baby as the vast majority simply wanted a child			0
lord @entity0 , who is instantly recognisable from his tv programmes such as @entity63 and @entity64 , told a fertility conference that new genetic screening technologies meant scientists working with @entity4 needed to be particularly aware of the danger of eugenics becoming more prevalent			1
worry : lord @entity0 claims the rich may be able to pay to have babies with enhanced intelligence , musical ability and strength taking aim at fertility colleagues and patients , he said : ‘ one of the problems with our work is that we have been carried away with massive enthusiasms in reproduction			1
that mixture of enthusiasm and patient desperation is actually a very toxic and heady mixture			2
it is worthwhile standing back a little from the technologies that we employ			0
‘ one of the issues of the market is that rich people may well be able to afford , in due course , the kind of enhancement to their genetics that other poor people may not be able to afford			0
’ the 73 - year - old added that a growing market for fertility treatments and pressure to enhance human qualities could mean we ‘ end up with a society where some people may actually have something that might threaten our humanity ’			1
lord @entity0 , emeritus professor of fertility studies at @entity107 , was delivering a speech at the @entity109 titled reflections on ivf technology – will we be human in 100 years ?			1
he told fellow fertility experts : ‘ the age of eugenics is one that we do n’t think of as being important now			2
’ but he added : ‘ in a world where there is conflict , where there is shortage of resources , shortage of water , shortage of food , climate change , i do n’t think it is impossible that this is necessarily going to die out			2
’ @entity4 scare : lord @entity0 , says experts and scientists have been ' carried away ' and that the breakthroughs might threaten ' our humanity ' the hugely controversial theory of eugenics suggests that humans can be improved by preventing people with supposedly undesirable qualities or genetic defects from reproducing			1
similarly , those seen to have ‘ desirable qualities ’ should be encouraged to have babies			0
it has been regarded as a toxic doctrine since it was used by the @entity144 to justify a compulsory sterilisation programme , whereby ‘ defectives ’ were not allowed to reproduce			2
@entity149 , of campaign group comment on @entity148 , said that @entity4 gives people the chance to think about having a perfect baby			0
she added : ‘ in many aspects , the opportunities to think about best and better are increasing by the moment			0
’ @entity156 , of the @entity157 , said : ‘ if lord @entity0 is saying this , i hope that people take notice			1
he is someone who is an expert in the area but also someone who sees the bigger picture			2
’ but @entity163 , chief executive of support group @entity164 @entity21 , said : ‘ most patients just want to have a baby			0
they are not looking to have a designer baby			0
’ she added that to the average patient , @entity4 is a lifeline – and eugenics is the last thing on their mind			0
dr @entity173 , the chairman of the @entity174 , said he doubts we will ever have the skill to alter complex traits such as musical ability			0
he added : ‘ the law prohibits it , even if it was technically possible			0
‘ most infertile couples are desperate for a baby , rather than a specific type of baby , and i do n’t see that changing			0

fertility expert @entity0 warns against breakthroughs in treatments
new ivf technology could see ' gene manipulation ' of foetuses in future
lord @entity0 says breakthroughs have created a ' toxic ' climate
