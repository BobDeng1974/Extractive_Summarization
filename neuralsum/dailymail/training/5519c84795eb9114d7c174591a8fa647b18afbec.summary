@entity7 , 14 , broke her right arm during a @entity10 lesson and could no longer play the violin after her arm healed at a bent angle			1
her parents were so concerned they took her for a second opinion to a surgeon at @entity17 to ask if there was anything he could do to help her continue her musical career			0
surgeon @entity23 then re-broke her arm and fixed it in place using a special titanium nail			1
after a few weeks of rest , her arm healed in the correct position and now @entity7 is back playing her violin			1
playing again : @entity7 , 14 , can play her violin again thanks to surgeons inserting a flexible nail in her forearm after her broken arm healed in a bent position before and after : @entity7 's right forearm was left bent in the middle after it healed from a break , pictured right , but it is now straight again after a flexible nail was inserted by surgeons , pictured left she has recently received the most promising player award from the orchestra that she plays with			1
her mother , @entity43 , 46 , a teaching assistant , said : ‘ we are just so thrilled			0
the operation has given @entity7 her confidence back and she can play the violin again , which is wonderful to hear			1
‘ she was devastated when she broke her arm and could n’t play the violin afterwards			1
her arm was bent at such an angle that it made it impossible for her to play			1
now she is back playing and loving every minute of it			0
’ @entity7 suffered the injury whilst having a @entity10 lesson at school in november 2011 , when she tripped over a trampoline			1
she went to @entity58 where her arm was put in plaster for eight weeks			0
but when the plaster was removed , @entity7 ’s arm had healed in a bent position , an occurrence which is rare but not unheard of and made it impossible for her to straighten it			1
jumping for joy : @entity7 had feared that she would never be able to play her instrument again mrs @entity68 , who lives with husband @entity70 , 50 , a primary school support worker , in @entity72 , said : ‘ we were shocked when the plaster cast was removed as she could n’t straighten her arm at all			1
‘ @entity7 was very embarrassed about what it looked like , so she wore long sleeved tops all the time			2
but it also meant that she could n’t play her violin anymore			2
she had been a very promising violinist up until the accident			0
it was a lot for a 12 year old girl to cope with			0
‘ she ’s been playing since the age of nine , and has already passed her grade four examination			0
she loves playing the violin and it was heartbreaking that she could n’t play it anymore			2
she could n’t rotate or straighten her arm at all			0
’ so mrs @entity68 took @entity7 back to see her gp in august last year , and she was referred to surgeon @entity23 at @entity17			2
he said he would try and re-break her arm and fix it using the special long flexible nail			1
delighted : @entity7 pictured with her mother @entity89 who took her to see specialist surgeon @entity23 so she could have a chance to play her violin again mrs @entity68 said : ‘ @entity7 was so excited before her operation			1
we were nervous in case it did n’t work , but we wanted her to have the chance to play her violin again and live a normal life			2
’ the operation was carried out in november and was a success			0
she remained in a plaster cast for six weeks and when it was removed , her arm was perfectly straight			2
@entity7 is now back playing her violin and is due to sit her grade five examination			2
she is also studying for her music gcse exam and has just been awarded the @entity103 award from her orchestra			0
mrs @entity68 said : ‘ she is thrilled to be back playing her violin and its all thanks to the surgeon who has helped her achieve that			0
‘ it is wonderful to hear her playing again			0
when her bone was so bent , we never thought it would be possible again			0
but now she can play beautifully again			0
’ surgeon @entity23 said : ‘ we corrected her arm fracture and stabilised it with an intramedullary flexible nail			1
she has now healed up , has full rotation once more and is back playing her violin - a fantastic result			0
