as they put hid ' body ' on a stretcher , one worker noticed the man was moving his arms not dead : although incredibly weak , the man could clearly be seen moving his arms to indicate he was still alive @entity48 : the realistion that the man was still alive prompted cheers from the large crowd of onlookers , who then had to plead with paramedics to take the man for treatment at the hospital the incident occurred earlier this week in an ebola - ravaged section of the @entity4 capital @entity12 and was captured on video by @entity32			1
thinking the man had already died , reporter dr @entity31 was filming a piece to camera , having spoken to several community leaders about the way the victim had been abandoned without medical treatment for several days			1
while the item was being recorded , a burial team arrived and began spraying the man - who had been covered by a blanket - with disinfectant and bleach			0
minutes later , as they started lifting him onto a stretcher to be placed in a mortuary vehicle , one of the funeral workers noticed he was still moving and a cry of ' he 's alive ' rang out			1

dying : the realisation that the man was still alive initially had little impact other than to convince the burial team to take the critically ill man off their stretcher and dump him back on the street reluctant : an ambulance arrived within 10 minutes , but locals had to plead with paramedics through the vehicle 's window to ensure the man was finally transported to a hospital at last : ambulance workers eventually put the critically ill man on a stretcher and took him to hospital hope : the reason it was difficult to get the dying man the medical care he so desperately needed is due to a chronic shortage of hospital beds for @entity1 victims in the virus - ravaged @entity4 capital @entity12 the sick man 's current state of health is not known , but dr @entity31 said he appeared so ill that it seems unlikely he would have been able to cling on to life for much longer than a few more hours			1
he said the reason it had proven so difficult to get him the medical care he so desperately needed is due to a chronic shortage of hospital beds for @entity1 victims in virus - ravaged @entity12			1
on the other hand , there is still plenty of space at @entity4 's cemeteries and crematoriums , which is why the burial team were more than happy to pick up what they thought was the man 's corpse within a hour of him being reported dead			0
