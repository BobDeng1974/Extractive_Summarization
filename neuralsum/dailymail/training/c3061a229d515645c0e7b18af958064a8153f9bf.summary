@entity5 , now 35 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , is suing the @entity8 for £ 750,000 , claiming surgeons ignored official cancer guidelines - robbing her of seeing her children grow up			1
the mother - of - two , who has terminal breast cancer , told the @entity14 in @entity15 that she was forced to wait five and half months before being seen by a specialist because of her age			1
dying mother : @entity5 ( left ) , 35 , of @entity6 , is suing the @entity8 for £ 750,000			1
surgeon @entity19 ( right ) classed the case as not one of ' urgent suspected cancer ' - because she was under 35 three breast cancer surgeons at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity7 , went against national guidelines of treating all lumps in women over 30 as urgent , the hearing was told			1
miss @entity5 was aged 31 when she went to her local gp after noticing a lump in her left breast			1
she told the court today : ‘ i could n’t but think that there was cancer inside my body			2
‘ i know the feeling of a cyst and this was a hard lump which got bigger			0
it started off as a lump the size of a pea and continued through my menstrual cycle and continued afterwards			0
‘ i went to my gp as i was concerned with my family history - my grandmother and great aunts all had breast cancer			2
’ her gp was so worried he faxed an ‘ urgent referral ’ form to the @entity52 - which brings together groups involved in planning , commissioning and provision of cancer care			2
but when surgeon @entity19 received the referral form he downgraded her to ‘ routine ’ and classed the case as not one of ‘ urgent suspected cancer ’ - because she was under 35			1
government guidelines state any woman aged 30 or older with a discrete lump which has persisted after her period should receive an urgent referral and be seen by a specialist within two weeks			1
in @entity69 this means miss @entity5 should have seen a specialist and had surgery to remove the tumour within two months			1
treatment : three breast cancer surgeons at the @entity25 ( above ) in @entity26 , @entity7 , went against national guidelines of treating all lumps in women over 30 as urgent , the hearing was told but because she had been downgraded to a routine referral she had to wait five and a half months to see a specialist , with the tumour growing in her breast and spreading through her body			1
an ultrasound scan performed on the day she finally saw the specialist confirmed her fears that she had cancer			1
she underwent surgery and lengthy chemotherapy and was cancer for free for several years until a lump appeared in her neck in april this year and she was told by doctors she had only 18 months to live			1
miss @entity5 told the hearing : ‘ standing or sitting for long periods of time is uncomfortable because of the cancer in my pelvis , spine and lower back			1
‘ it ’s hard cleaning the house or lifting my youngest son			0
i receive a lot of help from my partner and mother - in law - they help with the children and cleaning			0
’ @entity113 , representing @entity114 , told the hearing that medical experts were in ‘ broad agreement ’ that a woman of her age would have had a 90 per cent chance of surviving more than 10 years with urgent treatment			0
he said : ‘ that is what oncologists would regard as being cured			0
in the five and half month wait for treatment her chances of survival fell to between 70 and 80 per cent			0
’ terminal cancer : miss @entity5 ( pictured ) is due to marry her partner next month and her children @entity133 and @entity134 will be by her side at the service miss @entity5 is due to marry her partner next month and her children @entity133 , 14 , and @entity134 , 10 , will be by her side at the service			1
the mother , who was training to be a nurse when she was diagnosed as terminal , has been given 18 months to live			0
miss @entity5 is suing the @entity143 claiming mr @entity144 was negligent in downgrading her case to routine			1
miss @entity5 ’s damages claim includes the ‘ loss of unquantifiable services of a wife and mother ’			2
these include £ 7,500 a year from april 2017 to april 2027 , when her son @entity134 will be 21 , to cover the cost of a nanny for 20 hours a week at £ 6.93 an hour			0
mr @entity144 denies the accusation of negligence and said it was ‘ reasonable ’ to downgrade her case with the information he was given			0
he said because of the aggressive form of cancer @entity160 suffers from , the delay in her treatment has made no difference to her eventual terminal illness			0
he admits negligence in failing to tell her gp about the downgrading of her case and in not arranging for her case to be reviewed within three months			0
the court hearing was told mr @entity144 and two other surgeons at the hospital have now changed their policy to meet national guidelines			2
it also heard that @entity160 would have been seen within two weeks if she had lived in @entity175 rather than in @entity69			0
mr @entity176 told mr @entity144 : ‘ a woman of miss @entity5 ’s age with a discrete breast lump which had persisted for six weeks , referred on an urgent basis by her gp - certainly in @entity175 , that woman would expect to be seen in two weeks			2
‘ but at your hospital it was five - and - a - half months and you were happy for her to wait this long with a lump in her breast			2
’ mr @entity144 said : ‘ this is a hospital policy which i have to follow			0
’ the surgeon told the hearing he ‘ definitely ’ would have changed the referral back to urgent if he had received a letter or telephone call from the gp who initially referred her saying how concerned he was			0
but the hearing has been told @entity160 ’s gp was never made aware his patient had been downgraded against all national guidelines			0

@entity5 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , is suing @entity8 for £ 750,000
@entity205 , now aged 35 , claims surgeons ignored official cancer guidelines
