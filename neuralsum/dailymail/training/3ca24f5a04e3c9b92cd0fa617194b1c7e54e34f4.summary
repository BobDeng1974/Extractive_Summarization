they have been given a considerable helping hand , however , by @entity87			0
the normally assured @entity89 goalkeeper has fatally blundered twice and the mood around @entity5 is boiling			0
@entity91 will not be dissuaded from searching for goalkeeper cover in the summer			0
@entity87 makes a mess of @entity95 's cross from the right with @entity14 latching onto the loose ball and firing goalwards and it 's the @entity99 veteran @entity20 who pounces to give @entity1 the lead here with 20 minutes remaining			1

that was a gilt - edged chance for @entity1 to take the lead here			0
will it come back to haunt them later on ? a dour day on @entity174 so far			0
@entity91 's side have looked dangerous on the break but have failed to create enough goal - scoring opportunities despite dominating for long periods of that first half			0
@entity10 has set up us @entity1 side to contain the @entity0 and save for a few hairy moments , they have just that			1
@entity20 has looked a class apart for the visitors but @entity35 needs to up his game in the second half ... @entity1 play their way out from the back with @entity25 , @entity95 , @entity20 and @entity161 all getting plenty of touches before @entity136 intercepts and clears for a @entity13 throw - in			1
@entity196 shows good strength to hold up posession in the @entity0 box but @entity137 disposesses the @entity1 striker before laying the ball onto @entity136 whose deft pass releases @entity203 down the right			1
@entity203 plays the ball to @entity35 but @entity25 blocks his effort before @entity136 smashes the rebound high and wide			1
@entity76 causes havoc down the right again and drives into the @entity1 box before squaring the ball to @entity35 who fires over the bar			2
after his hat - trick heroics on thursday , he 'll be disappointed with that effort			0
@entity148 clatters into @entity6 and referee @entity215 reaches for the yellow card immediately			0
the @entity1 centre back will need to be on his best behaviour for the rest of the contest			0
not an ideal situation when you 're marking @entity35 mind			0

the young @entity0 midfielder drives forward and frees up @entity35 with clever , disguised pass but the @entity109 is caught marginally offside with the @entity1 goal at his mercy			1
another let - off for @entity1			0
after a shaky start , @entity0 are looking far more assured here at @entity5 with @entity137 , @entity54 and @entity136 getting plenty of touches between them			1
@entity47 and @entity76 are looking threatening and are getting forward with far more regularity			0

@entity76 gets free on the right again and plays the ball into the @entity13 box but @entity148 does well to intercept			2
@entity20 does well to steal to steal possession from @entity269 and lays the ball onto @entity114 who plays a lovely one - two with @entity113 before launching a strong right - footed shot which @entity87 parries away for a corner			1
@entity0 clear the danger but the visitors will be happy with that early attack			0
@entity148 and @entity276 are leading out their sides at @entity5			2
