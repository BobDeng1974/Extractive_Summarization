on the day it was revealed @entity3 will almost certainly play no part in the @entity5 , veteran @entity1 @entity0 provided yet another reminder of his timeless quality as @entity8 tamed @entity9 with consummate ease			1
@entity11 may have won the last of his 47 international caps in @entity15 ’s @entity14 quarter - final defeat to @entity16 in @entity17 almost four years ago , but at 36 he retains all the qualities which made him @entity19 ’s first - choice @entity20 during his reign			1
on saturday , playing his 250th match for the club , he was simply outstanding			1
veteran no 8 @entity0 put in a man of the match display as @entity8 kept their play - off hopes alive @entity11 , who won the last of his 47 @entity15 caps four years ago , was outstanding for @entity8 against @entity9 his first - half off - load to put @entity29 in for a try was as good as anything seen in the @entity33 this season and he deservedly won the man - of - the - match award in a high - class @entity8 back row which also included returning @entity15 captain @entity37 and the hugely promising @entity38			1
‘ @entity0 ’s off - load was not just world class , it was out of this world , ’ said delighted @entity8 director of rugby @entity39			1
‘ we ’ve been very , very fortunate to have @entity0 at the club while i ’ve been here			2
he may be old school in some ways , he challenges , but he plays at a level that very few people can			0
‘ the harder the going becomes , the better he plays			0
’ @entity29 impressed for @entity8 in front of watching @entity15 forwards coach @entity53 @entity29 breaks through a tackle to score his side 's first try against @entity9 on saturday @entity57 has steadfastly resisted calls to pick @entity11 since taking over from @entity19 following the @entity60 debacle , preferring to blood youngsters @entity3 and @entity62			1
but with the clock ticking until the next @entity14 , and @entity11 in the form of his life , it will be hard for him to ignore him much longer			0
‘ i ’ve stopped speaking to @entity57 about him because i ’m banging my head , ’ @entity39 added			0
‘ i do n’t know what @entity3 ’s injury is but @entity0 wants to play for @entity15			1
@entity57 and i had a good long chat about him last year and his worry was always whether he would get to the @entity14 with the ability to play with that sort of intensity and that pace and if he comes to the end of the season playing like that he will have a look at him			0
‘ i ’ve no doubt in a few months ’ time he ’ll be more than ready but it ’s not my choice			0
’ it remains to be seen if @entity85 will select @entity11 for his side ’s opening @entity5 clash with @entity88 in @entity89 on february 6 but with two big @entity91 fixtures against @entity92 and then @entity93 , @entity11 has two more huge stages to showcase his skills over the next fortnight			0
@entity15 captain @entity37 ( centre ) made a winning return as he helped @entity8 to a bonus - point victory @entity37 had been absent for the last five weeks as he recovered from a shoulder injury former @entity15 captain @entity101 in the commentary box was certainly in no about @entity11 ’s qualities as he described him as ‘ the best @entity20 in the @entity33 ’			1
@entity37 was hardly less impressive in his first game in four weeks following the shoulder injury which threatened his @entity5 participation and could yet require surgery			1
the @entity15 skipper carried superbly and , alongside the intelligent @entity38 at @entity110 , @entity8 ’ back row completely outplayed the vaunted @entity9 trio of @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			2
this was right up there with @entity8 ’ best display of the season and , following an impressive run in @entity91 , they are hitting the second half of the season with real impetus			0
the deserved bonus - point win , sealed by substitute @entity127 ’s 80th - minute try , moves @entity39 ’s men up to seventh place in the @entity33 table , just two points off the top four			1
fly - half @entity132 contributed 10 points for @entity8 with two penalties and two conversions every side above them will be looking anxiously over their shoulders			2
‘ we needed a win like this to get us buzzing , ’ added @entity39			2
‘ we needed that win more than @entity9			2
’ care ’s try was the pick of the game for @entity8 , simply for the brilliance of @entity0 ’s pass out of @entity151 ’ tackle , but @entity38 also crossed for a well - worked first - half score and @entity153 capitalised on a wayward @entity155 clearance to cross for the home side ’s third try in the 46th minute			1
@entity132 kicked 12 points for @entity8 with @entity155 kicking four penalties for a desperately under par @entity9 side in front of 14,800 at the @entity162			0
‘ we got what we deserved , ’ said @entity9 boss @entity163			0
‘ you have to take your opportunities in games and we did n’t take ours			0
we were n’t accurate and it ’s disappointing			0

@entity15 captain @entity37 returned after five weeks out with injury
@entity0 , 36 , was outstanding at no 8 for man - of - the - match
@entity29 's impact will also have had national selectors taking note
*harlequins* remain in the hunt for a top - four finish after bonus - point win
