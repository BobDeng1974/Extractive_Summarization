by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 08:34 est , 6 june 2013 it was the scene of some of @entity4 ’s fiercest fighting , where almost 700 brave @entity6 troops were killed or wounded			1
exactly 69 years ago today - june 6 1944 - courageous @entity6 forces went ashore at @entity8 into a ferocious barrage from @entity11 guns			1
but on the anniversary of the @entity4 , as thousands congregate on the coast to remember the selfless @entity16 sacrifice , veterans are furious their role in history is being airbrushed by money - grabbing @entity21 tourism chiefs			1
exactly 69 years ago today - june 6 1944 - courageous @entity6 forces went ashore at @entity8 into a ferocious barrage from @entity11 guns a new promotional campaign to highlight the ‘ secteur mythique ’ - or ‘ mythical sector ’ where the invasion took place - has wiped the legendary landing zone off the map			1
@entity4 was a key turning point in the destruction of the @entity32			1
but the tourist trail , designed to appeal to visitors from all over the world , covers only four of the five main areas of @entity16 assault			0
it stretches from @entity40 and @entity41 in the west , where @entity44 troops landed , to @entity46 and @entity47 beaches , where @entity6 and @entity49 servicemen respectively attacked occupied @entity50			2
but under controversial proposals it stops short of @entity53 , the eastern-most flank of @entity55 , the largest seaborne invasion in military history			0
it also excludes drop zones inland where @entity6 paratroopers and glider pilots from @entity62 ’s @entity61 landed to secure fabled @entity63 , the strategically - vital crossing over the @entity65			1
the successful taking of the bridge played an important role in limiting the effectiveness of a @entity11 counter-attack in the days and weeks following the invasion			0
six tourist boards along the @entity74 coast said they wanted the ‘ mythical sector ’ to concentrate on the @entity44 sectors - featured in the @entity77 blockbuster @entity76 - which attract 85 per cent of the 4.5 million visitors each year			2
but veterans and local people have accused officials of being motivated by greed rather than honouring the sacrifices made on @entity8			2
@entity86 , 88 , the honorary secretary general of the @entity85 , said : ‘ i ’m astounded			0
i ca n’t see how you can do the story of @entity74 without including all the beaches			0
‘ during the ten weeks of the @entity74 campaign the @entity6 accounted for almost half of those killed			2
surely this has to be covered			0
‘ a couple of my good mates were on @entity8 and they went through hell			2
to ignore it is disrespect to those who were killed , injured or fought there			0
’ mr @entity86 , who served in the @entity99 on d - day , said that were he alive today the @entity6 commander in chief general sir @entity102 ‘ would be absolutely livid			1
’ @entity104 , 92 , a former @entity6 infantryman who landed on nearby @entity105 , said : ‘ leaving places like @entity53 and @entity107 out of a d - day tourist trail is disgraceful – there can be no good reason for it , except to perpetuate the myth that the @entity44 did all the fighting			1
a new promotional campaign to highlight the ' secteur mythique ' - or ' mythical sector ' where the invasion took place - has wiped the legendary landing zone off the map ‘ this kind of nonsense has been going on for too long			1
the sacrifice our troops made should never be forgotten			0
’ @entity21 historian @entity125 , who runs the @entity128 website @entity126 , criticised the decision by local tourism officials			1
he said : ‘ what they consider is money			0
instead of making an effort on @entity8 and the @entity138 drop zones , these tourist offices just care about the most popular areas			2
‘ what will @entity6 and @entity21 veterans who landed at @entity140 on @entity4 think ? what will be the thoughts of those who were parachuted northeast of @entity144 ? ‘ what about their fallen comrades , killed to free a piece of land that is not considered “ mythical ” enough according to these six tourist offices ? ’ admiral @entity150 , head of @entity151 , which organises d - day commemorations in @entity21 , said @entity53 was a ‘ sacred ’ sector , and that the initiative was driven by money - spinning tourist concerns			1
‘ there should be a rethink , ’ he said			0
a protest petition calling for the scrapping of the ‘ disrespectful ’ project has attracted more than 3,000 signatures			0
on june 6 some 135,000 @entity16 soldiers landed on the five beaches			0
by the end of the ferocious fighting on what was immortalised in film as the @entity169 , around 4,000 @entity16 troops had been killed – but the invaders had secured a foothold in @entity172			0
@entity8 stretches roughly five miles from @entity173 to @entity174			2
the @entity16 forces most heavily involved in the assault there were the @entity6 3rd @entity178 was where brigadier @entity179 landed with a brigade of @entity182 soldiers who later linked up with troops holding @entity63			1
symbolically , the @entity6 were accompanied by a small unit of free @entity21 commandoes , led by gallic war hero @entity186			1
the @entity21 lost 177 men on @entity8			1
@entity188 , president of the @entity189 , said : ‘ is the sweat , the blood shed by the @entity6 and @entity21 commandoes of less value ? ’ the ‘ mythical sector ’ campaign is designed to promote the area ahead of next year ’s 70th anniversary , and is the theme for this month ’s d – @entity200 , organised by the tourist boards			1
@entity202 , mayor of @entity204 , and a tourist chief supporting the six local boards ’ decision , said : ‘ i do n’t understand the controversy			0
‘ the draft mythical sector and its scope are still under consideration			0
we have not committed to anything			0
