@entity1 mps are pushing to bring into effect measures in the @entity11 – which were not implemented by the @entity12 – making companies publish the difference between male and female pay			1
conservatives resisted the plans on the basis that companies should not be loaded with more red tape as the economy recovers from the financial crash			1
but government sources said that with @entity25 backing a change in the law , the @entity24 were confronted with the prospect of defeat in a crunch vote in the @entity31			1
one said conservative ministers had agreed the reform would be introduced , but only after a consultation with business leaders on exactly how it will work			0
former conservative deputy prime minister @entity36 said he opposed the legislation because it would create ‘ more bureaucracy , more forms , more deterrent for companies to take on people ’			2
the new law will make it compulsory for larger companies to publish the average difference between the pay of their male and female employees			1
a voluntary approach to pay transparency encouraged by the government has so far led to only five of the country ’s larger companies revealing their gender pay gaps			1
@entity25 says that analysis of the @entity58 ’ annual survey of hours and earnings show that over a career , from the age of 22 to 64 , a woman earns an average of £ 209,976 less than men			1

‘ these measures will shine a light on a company ’s policy so that women can rightly challenge their employer where they are not being properly valued and rewarded			0
’ a @entity1 source added : ‘ in discussions this week it was clear that the @entity24 wanted to delay taking any action on equal pay and kick the can down the road , just like they have for the last five years			1
‘ it ’s a huge u-turn from the @entity24 but it ’s welcomed			2
at last we can take some real action			0
