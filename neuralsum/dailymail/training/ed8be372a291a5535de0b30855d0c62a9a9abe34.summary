by @entity1 reporter published : 07:39 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 4 october 2013 government services across the @entity3 may have all but ground to a halt , but there is one that remains open for business as usual : the @entity10 paradise of @entity11			1
the woodland retreat has stayed immune to the shutdown because it falls under the aegis of the @entity15 , whose staff are designated as active - duty military personnel			1
more than 250 chefs , gardeners , electricians and anybody else who keeps the camp running in @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , should the president drop by are not only still working , but are also getting paid , according to website @entity28			1
meanwhile , almost a million federal workers across the nation are sitting at home wondering when their next paycheck will drop through the letterbox as they wait for a resolution to the long - running dispute			1
presidential paradise : @entity3 president @entity38 reads briefing material while meeting with advisors inside his cabin at @entity11 , @entity27 , last year but their situation showed little sign of improving today as lawmakers consumed day three of the shutdown with a stalling game revealing no end in sight until the next crisis hits @entity51 around october 17			1
meanwhile , in a speech at a @entity27 construction company yesterday , @entity38 challenged republicans to ' stop this farce ' by allowing a straight vote on a spending bill			2
he reiterated he will not negotiate on the spending bill or the debt ceiling			2
danger : the situation gives ' every appearance of getting dangerously close to the conversation on the debt ceiling , ' @entity65 , the @entity66 @entity38 said there were enough @entity54 willing to pass a spending bill immediately if @entity70 speaker @entity69 would allow a vote on a bill without partisan conditions attached , a so - called clean vote			2
but @entity38 said the speaker was refusing to do so because ' he does n't want to anger the extremists in his party			2
' the 180 - acre compound has been a home from home for @entity3 presidents to relax in since @entity81 converted it in 1942 and renamed it ' @entity84 ' , after the fictional @entity86 paradise			2
it was renamed @entity11 by @entity88 , in honor of his father and grandson , both named @entity92			1
it has a swimming pool , tennis courts , a skeet range , a bathhouse , a bowling alley , a horseshoe pit and many cabins for the president 's guests			1
@entity11 is not open to the general public			2
@entity25 does not indicate the location of @entity11 on its official park maps due to privacy and security concerns			2
( pictured : @entity109 bush and former @entity111 prime minister @entity110 during a visit to camp @entity92 in 2007 ) ' my simple message today is ' call a vote , ' @entity38 said			1
stop this farce , and end this shutdown right now			2
' @entity119 must raise the nation 's borrowing authority or risk default by october 17 , and members of @entity119 now expect it to be the flashpoint for a larger clash over the @entity3 budget as well as president @entity38 's healthcare law			1
the situation gives ' every appearance of getting dangerously close to the conversation on the debt ceiling , ' @entity65 , the @entity66			2
in fact , she said , ' we 're in the conversation on the debt ceiling			2
' at the same time , hopes that the debt ceiling fight could be resolved without a catastrophe were raised by reports in the @entity140 and @entity141 that @entity70 speaker @entity69 told other lawmakers he would work to avoid default , even if it meant relying on the votes of @entity145 , as he did in august of 2011			1
a spokesman for @entity69 would neither confirm nor deny the reports , restating previous public statements by the speaker that ' the @entity3 will not default on its debt			0
' senator @entity149 , the second - ranking @entity151 @entity150 , reacting to the reports , said , ' this could be the beginnings of a significant breakthrough			0
' the @entity156 senator added , ' even coming close to the edge of default is very dangerous , ' as he urged quick passage of legislation to raise the $ 16.7 trillion cap on borrowing			0
closed : staff at @entity164 and museums across the country were stopped from coming to work , closing those sites to the public deserted : the usually - crowded @entity169 , site of the original @entity3 @entity171 , is empty of visitors after tours were closed safety first : airport - screening staff will remain at work during the shutdown with safety being a top priority there was little action along with the talk on thursday			1
the @entity54 - controlled @entity70 continued what has become a long process of voting to fund publicly popular federal agencies - like the @entity186 , the @entity187 and the @entity188 - that are now partially closed			0
@entity54 know that neither the @entity66 - controlled @entity151 or president @entity38 will go along with such an approach , but it allows them to accuse @entity145 of working against the interests of veterans , @entity164 and cancer patients			1
up to one million @entity3 federal workers have been on furloughs without pay since tuesday morning			0
all military personnel continued in a normal duty status but a large number of civilian employees may be temporarily furloughed			0
the employees who have been put on unpaid leave are those classified as excepted workers , meaning that the president 's staff of 1,265 at the @entity70 will dwindle to 436			1
staff at @entity164 and museums across the country were stopped from coming to work , closing those sites to the public			1
both domestic and international air travel remained relatively unchanged as air traffic controllers will be kept at their posts and @entity219 agents will continue security checks			0
one problem may arise as the state @entity15 will be understaffed , meaning that while it will not stop processing passport applications			1
federal courts remain open for about 10 business days			1
by october 15 , the federal judiciary will need to provide more guidance			0
meat inspectors for the @entity3 @entity230 , considered necessary to national food security , have stayed on the job			0
@entity70 @entity54 on thursday began queuing up 11 more bills to fund targeted programs			0
they are to fund nutrition programs for low - income women and their children , a program to secure nuclear weapons and non-proliferation , food and drug safety , intelligence - gathering , border patrols , @entity245 and @entity248 health and education programs , weather monitoring , @entity251 school programs for the poor and other aid for schools that rely heavily on federal assistance			0
disaster assistance also is slated for temporary renewal under the @entity70 measures , as well as a bill to provide retroactive pay to federal workers during the government shutdown			0
' we 're trying to see if we can get the @entity151 and the president to start talking to us , on anything			1
they 're just not talking to us , ' said @entity266 representative @entity266 of @entity267 , explaining the tactic			0
the bills are likely to be debated on the @entity70 floor over coming days , not all at once			0
@entity145 have rejected the piecemeal approach and @entity38 has said he will veto the measures			0
work in @entity119 was interrupted on thursday afternoon when the @entity3 @entity274 was locked down briefly due to gunshots fired outside the building			1
one female suspect was shot dead after a brief car chase across downtown @entity51			0
police said it appeared to be an isolated incident			0
the security alert halted work in both the @entity70 and the @entity151 and briefly diverted attention from the shutdown that took effect at midnight on monday , leaving nearly a million federal workers sidelined without pay and many others in the private sector suffering from the knock - on effect			1
the @entity279 who responded to the incident are working without pay due to the shutdown - they are deemed essential so remain on the job , but their pay is frozen			1
in his speech earlier , @entity38 warned that as painful as the government shutdown was , a default caused by a failure to raise the debt limit would be dramatically worse for the economy			0
lunch is served : school students who qualify for free school lunches and breakfast will not go hungry even if the shutdown goes ahead this week shutdown : the tourist trips to @entity310 stopped running though some moderate @entity54 have begun to question their party 's strategy , @entity69 so far has kept them largely united with the small bills to re-open national parks , restore health research and other parts of the government most visibly affected by the shutdown			0
the @entity319 , one of the anti-tax groups in the conservative @entity319 that has led the fight against @entity323 , sent an email to supporters on wednesday evening saying that as many as 12 @entity54 had indicated they were willing to " give up on the fight " and join @entity145 in voting for a funding bill without conditions			0
' we need your immediate support to put pressure on the weak republicans to pass a sensible solution that allows @entity3 to avoid the @entity323 train - wreck , while fully funding the federal government , ' the group said in its email .			0

more than 250 camp @entity92 staff remain at work should the president drop by
they *include* chefs , gardeners and electricians who are also getting paid
the camp falls under @entity15 so all staff are deemed essential
