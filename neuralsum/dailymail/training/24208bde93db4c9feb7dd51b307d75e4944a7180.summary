he will be remembered for ever but that is no compliment			0
the @entity3 will be associated with @entity4 in the same way @entity6 1982 is synonymous with @entity7			1
i hardly saw the @entity10 goalkeeper play but mention his name and i know immediately he was responsible for the outrageous collision in the semi-final that left @entity15 midfielder @entity14 unconscious			1
it was one of the most shocking incidents in @entity3 history but , unfortunately , @entity4 has put himself in that bracket after biting @entity20			1
rather than being regarded as one of the finest forwards in the game , he ’s now simply known as the one who bites people			1
i worked with @entity4 every day for two - and - a - half years at @entity36 and if you spent time in his company at @entity39 , you would struggle to believe he was capable of such ridiculous moments			1
he ’s a quiet lad , in the main			0
he ’s not someone who squares up to people on the training ground if things do n’t go his way and he ’s not overly - aggressive or a bully			2
yes , his desire to win is fierce but that is no different from a lot of top professionals			0
as for him needing a ‘ mental edge ’ to operate at the highest level , that ’s nonsense			0
he is a special footballer because he scores incredible goals , his skill , tremendous physical capabilities and enthusiasm			0
he pushes himself to the limit but that does n’t mean we should have to accept moments of madness			0
star : @entity4 has deservedly picked up a host of personal awards while at @entity36 shocking : @entity20 shows his wounds to the referee during @entity31 's win against @entity70 playing the victim : the 27 - year - old held his teeth in pain after the incident against @entity70 on tuesday evidence : @entity20 seemed to have a red bite mark on his left shoulder after the incident @entity4 will be distraught today			1
when he bit @entity80 during a 2 - 2 draw with @entity82 in april 2013 , in the days and weeks that followed you could see how much of an impact it had made on him			0
he was devastated , as was his wife , @entity88			0
do not think , however , i am looking to defend him			0
i did n’t when he tangled with @entity80 and i ’m not changing my view			0
@entity4 ’s actions have been disgraceful and it defies belief that he could behave as if he was in a playground once again after everything @entity36 have done for him			1
the signs last season had been encouraging			0
he was booked only six times ( compared to 11 times in 2012 - 13 ) and benefited from a philosophy @entity100 calls ‘ match management ’			0
he wants players to remain calm and focused at all times			0
dr @entity104 goes to every @entity36 game for a variety of reasons but part of it is to analyse ‘ impulse management ’ and he will study how players react in pressure situations			1
the system worked last year because @entity36 topped the fair play league			2
horrifying : @entity7 of @entity10 ( right ) jumps past the ball as he gets ready to collide with @entity116 defender @entity14 ( left ) during the 1982 @entity3 semi-final wrong : @entity7 's collision with @entity14 is one of the most shocking incident in @entity3 history but away from that environment , he has lost focus and if i ’m honest , i do n’t believe he will change			1
he will always have that tendency to self - destruct			0
this latest incident mirrored the ones with @entity80 and @entity130 ’s @entity129 — it was a split - second reaction , instinctive			0
could there be an element he felt he would get away with it ? think about it : why would you choose to bite someone ? when the red mist descends on a footballer , you may expect a punch to be thrown , an elbow to be swung or even a headbutt but if you bite someone , it is virtually impossible to be detected by match officials			0
no referee will ever see you if you get in close enough and tv pictures may prove inconclusive			0
had these incidents taken place 20 years ago , when there were not so many tv cameras in stadiums , @entity4 might never have been punished			2
after all , none of the referees in the games in which he bit @entity129 , @entity80 and @entity20 sent him off , as neither they nor their assistants saw the crime take place			2
guilty ? the @entity31 talisman seemed to have something on his mind after the final whistle shame : @entity4 would have been remembered for his stunning performance against @entity165 stunning : the forward scored twice to help @entity31 defeat @entity165 in the @entity169 clash but he has been caught and now some questions need to be answered on what the consequences will be for @entity36 , who have done everything they can to help him psychologically by making dr @entity104 available to him at all times			1
the biggest previous punishment handed out by @entity178 , of course , was the eight - game ban imposed on @entity181 when he broke @entity183 ’s nose with an elbow at the @entity185 @entity3 in 1994 — i maintain a footballer would rather be bitten than have his nose smashed or be left unconscious , like @entity14			1
i have thought about it and believe the biggest way to hurt him would have been for @entity178 to suspend him for the rest of the @entity3 and then ban him for a calendar year , which would rule him out of @entity31 ’s @entity196 defence in @entity197 next summer			2
people are calling for a worldwide ban but i do n’t think @entity36 should be punished			1
@entity31 did n’t suffer when he served the @entity80 ban , did they ? he missed the first five @entity204 games , during which time @entity36 dropped five points against @entity207 and @entity208			2
the form @entity4 was in last year , i ’m certain he would have made the difference in those matches and @entity36 would have then won the title			1
down : @entity20 clutches his shoulder after clashing with @entity4 during the @entity169 match trouble ahead : @entity4 ( left ) is the subject of disciplinary proceedings by @entity178 rematch : @entity4 has had his eyes on @entity20 for quite some time ¿ the pair met in last year ¿ s @entity220 with @entity36 , his situation is even more complicated			1
those who are saying the club should make a stand and drum him out have no grasp on reality because no business would get shot of an £ 80million asset for nothing or a reduced fee			0
@entity4 is not like @entity232 , the @entity233 goalkeeper who was sacked by @entity36 in 2009 after he was caught misbehaving at the @entity234			1
@entity232 was no good , had a bad attitude and was never going to play , so getting shot of him was easy to do			0
you would never say the same about @entity4 but there comes a point when enough is enough			2
you have to wonder whether @entity241 and @entity242 have been put off by what they saw in @entity32 but there is no doubt his future will become a massive issue			1
bad attitude : @entity232 was sacked by @entity36 in 2009 after misbehaving at the @entity234 decision : @entity100 may have to allow @entity4 to leave @entity36 after his latest misdemeanor now you get the feeling that @entity36 might actually be relieved if @entity241 or @entity242 come in with a bid that triggers a move			1
if a lucrative offer arrives in the next few weeks , i am convinced @entity4 will be playing his football somewhere else next season			2
he has been a magnificent player and that is why @entity36 supporters have staunchly stood by him but even they believe now that this latest controversy is something the club can do without			2
and the problem you have with @entity4 , for all his wonderful gifts , is that this episode is unlikely to be his last			2
@entity267 : @entity36 may be relieved when @entity241 or @entity242 come in with a bid			1

the @entity3 will be associated with @entity4 's bite on @entity20
the incident is *n't* dissimilar to @entity7 's lunge on @entity14 during the 1982 @entity3
@entity36 may actually be relieved if @entity242 or @entity241 make a bid for the *striker*
he should be regarded as one of the finest but he will be known as the one who bites people
