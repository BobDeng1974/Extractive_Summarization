" i 'm going to be boring from now on , " he said			2
" ( i will ) give you nothing to write about			0

" @entity0 's comments were made after @entity5 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity10 in october @entity0 could have fallen foul of the @entity3 for questioning decisions in the two matches either side of the @entity10 defeat , with the loss at @entity54 and a 2 - 2 draw at @entity56 also seeing him question certain decisions			1
he then saw @entity5 lose 3 - 1 at home to @entity59 on monday night in a game where the @entity5 were denied at least one clear penalty			2
the former @entity63 and @entity64 boss reined in his comments following the defeat as he struggles to work out what would constitute an @entity3 charge , having seen @entity70 's @entity69 avoid a fine for his remarks after a soft penalty was awarded in their game at @entity75			2
" you have to watch what you say otherwise you are going to get fined , " he added			0
