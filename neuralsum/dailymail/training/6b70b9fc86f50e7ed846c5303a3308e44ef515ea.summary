nemesis : @entity6 's arch - rival in the record - setting business is @entity106 , the @entity107 businessman in his 70s who claims to have logged more than 15 million miles on different airlines while his friend abandoned the challenge due to health problems , the 59 - year - old decided to go for the record , although he admits that he could not have done it flying coach			2
