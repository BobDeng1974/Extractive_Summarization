president @entity0 told @entity1 on tuesday that 2014 should be the year to finally close the @entity1 prison at @entity3 as the @entity1 winds down its military role in @entity5 and shifts away from a ‘ permanent war footing			1
’ in his annual @entity8 address , mr @entity0 renewed his old vow - dating back to the start of his presidency five years ago - to shut the internationally condemned jail at the @entity1 @entity13 in @entity14 , and he called on @entity15 for further action to help him do so			1
‘ this needs to be the year @entity15 lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at @entity3 , ’ he said			1
‘ because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action , but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world			2
they were rounded up overseas after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and have been held without trial ever since			1
after @entity1 lawmakers made it easier late last year to transfer @entity3 inmates to their home countries , mr @entity0 is now in a better position to gradually reduce the detainee population			1
but signaling that major obstacles remain , he said @entity15 needed to give him further flexibility			2
the effort to close @entity3 is a critical part of the president 's broader drive to roll back some of controversial aspects of the global fight against @entity60 militants as he presses ahead with plans to formally end the long , unpopular war in @entity5 by the end of the year			1
‘ even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks , ’ mr @entity0 said , ‘ @entity1 must move off a permanent war footing			0
’ in a speech that focused mostly on domestic issues , mr @entity0 reminded @entity1 that he had already imposed ‘ prudent limits ’ on deadly @entity1 drone strikes against @entity71 and its allies - a campaign that has drawn criticism for civilian casualties in countries such as @entity77 , @entity5 and @entity78			0
‘ we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence , ’ he said			0
detainees sit in a holding area watched by military police at @entity86 inside @entity87 , @entity14 , during processing police escort a detainee to his cell at @entity3 , a detention facility @entity0 has vowed to shut down he also reasserted the pledge he made earlier this month to reform @entity1 surveillance activities			1
the move was triggered by former spy agency contractor @entity96 's revelations of the government 's vast collection of phone data , including eavesdropping on some allied foreign leaders			0
reaction from human rights groups was initially muted			0
‘ president @entity0 's legacy is at stake and his time is slipping away , ’ said @entity105 , director of @entity107 's @entity106			2
‘ we 've heard this before and now is the time for action , to finally transfer the 77 @entity3 detainees cleared to leave , reveal the names of people killed by drones , end mass surveillance and end the constant state of war , ’ he said			1
opened by president @entity122 in 2002 , @entity3 became a symbol of the excesses of his administration 's ‘ war on terror ’ interrogation and detention practices			1
even he expressed a desire to close the camp near the end of his presidency			0
while seeking to turn the page on the @entity122 era , mr @entity0 failed to meet his promise to shut the prison within a year of taking office in early 2009			1
though he recommitted several times to his pledge , he was reluctant to set a new time frame for achieving it			0
@entity0 stopped short in his speech of offering any new prescriptions on how he intends to empty @entity3 of its remaining 155 prisoners long a subject of international criticism but low on the list of the @entity1 public 's concerns , @entity3 was thrust back in the spotlight last year by a hunger strike and the military 's decision to force - feed prisoners to keep them alive			1
mr @entity0 's renewed promise followed congressional passage in december of a broader defense spending bill that loosened some restrictions on his ability to send more of the detainees home			0
despite that , he still faces limits on his room to maneuver			0
lawmakers refused to budge on a ban on bringing @entity3 prisoners to the @entity1 mainland			1
on top of that , complications remain with @entity78 , where @entity1 officials fear released prisoners might join up with an active @entity71 branch			2
@entity78 's government also has yet to build a long - promised detention center for any prisoners sent home			2
about half of @entity3 's remaining detainees have been cleared for transfer or release since 2009 , but most were blocked from going home because of congressional restrictions			1
still , nearly four dozen prisoners are considered too dangerous to release			2
and @entity0 can also expect continued pressure from some lawmakers , including @entity189 critics , who want to keep @entity3 open			1
despite that , the administration has shown signs of a more active transfer policy in recent months			0
it sent two detainees back to @entity196 , two to @entity197 and two to @entity199 , and it sent the three remaining ethnic @entity202 @entity201 inmates to @entity203			0
mr @entity0 also used his speech to reassure a war - weary @entity1 public that the @entity1 military was on track to withdraw from @entity5 after more than a decade of war there			0
‘ we will complete our mission there by the end of this year , and @entity1 's longest war will finally be over , ’ he said			0
he also sent a thinly veiled warning to @entity5 president @entity217 , who is locked in a test of wills with @entity36 over efforts to reach a long - term security pact that would enable a small contingent of @entity1 forces to remain in the country beyond 2014			2
the @entity225 has warned that it will resort to a ‘ zero option , ’ pulling out all @entity1 forces at the end of the year unless he signs a security deal soon .			0
