by @entity0 published : 04:28 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 13:44 est , 22 march 2013 an extremely rare fossil of footprints made more than 300million years ago has been discovered by a 10 - year - old schoolboy			1
@entity4 , a pupil at @entity5 in @entity6 , brought a piece of shale with what he thought might be a fossilised imprint to the after - school club at @entity13 's @entity12			1
astonished museum experts found it appeared to contain trackways left by a horseshoe crab crawling up the muddy slopes of an ancient shore around 320million years ago			1
amazing find : @entity6 schoolboy @entity4 holds up the piece of shale he found which experts say contains the fossilised footprints made by a pair of mating horseshoe crabs 300million years ago well spotted : a close - up view shows the faint tracks on the piece of slate @entity31 , education officer at the museum , said : ‘ footprints of this age are incredibly rare and extremely hard to spot , so we were amazed when @entity4 produced them at our after - @entity37			1
@entity4 poses with a preserved horseshoe crab : the 10 - year - old collected the fossil while on holiday in @entity42 last summer ' still more impressive is the fact that @entity4 had a hunch they might be some kind of footprints , even though the specimen had some of our world expert geologists arguing about it over their microscopes ! ' @entity4 ’s fossil has been confirmed by the @entity12 as likely showing footprints of a pair of mating horseshoe crabs laid down during the @entity59 period , some 308 - 327million years ago			1
at this time , the sea was slowly being sealed off as the @entity62 ’s landmasses crunched together to form @entity63			0
the museum 's @entity64 encourages year 6 children to develop their interest in the natural world			2
it is hopes that some might become the next generation of geologists and zoologists			0
the club ’s weekly sessions look at rocks , fossils , insects and other animal life			2
members are encouraged to make observations and collect specimens to be shared each week			0
horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans , but are more closely related to spiders and scorpions than lobsters and shrimp			0
they are one of the world 's oldest species , with the earliest fossils found in strata from the late @entity95 period , roughly 450 million years ago			1
they live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms , but will occasionally come on shore for mating			0
they are commonly used as bait and in fertilizer , and in recent years , habitat destruction and over-harvesting has led to a decline in numbers			0
@entity4 was specially selected for the club by his teachers , after showing a particular interest in nature			2
he collected the fossil while on holiday in @entity42 last summer			1
‘ unfortunately , the excitement and motivation that many children instinctively feel for studying nature is often lost during their teenage years as it is seen as ' uncool ' or a bit ' weird ' , and science can become text - book oriented and exam - driven during secondary school , ’ mr @entity31 said			1
‘ the club is our attempt to encourage children to value and extend their skills and knowledge and to follow their interests			0
' i hope it is helping to create a group of kids that will continue to share their interests into their teenage years and beyond			0
’ @entity4 and his family have decided to donate the fossil specimen to the @entity12 ’s collection .			2

youngster brought shale containing prints to museum after - school club
experts say crab footprints were laid down in the @entity59 period
