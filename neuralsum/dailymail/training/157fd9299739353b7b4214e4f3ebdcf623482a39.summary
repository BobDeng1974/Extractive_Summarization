by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:36 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 12:53 est , 30 september 2013 @entity2 tonight tore into the @entity4 @entity3 , warning a vote for the @entity7 party would hand election victory to @entity9			1
the mayor of @entity11 burnished his eurosceptic credentials , claiming people are twice as likely to be murdered in @entity14 as in @entity11 – blaming @entity15 ‘ bumping off their husbands with poisoned profiteroles ’			2
but arriving at the @entity20 party conference in @entity21 without the media hullabaloo seen in previous years , he appeared to go further than ever before in ruling out one day running for party leader			1
thumbs down : @entity2 rejected the overtures of the @entity4 @entity3 insisting voters @entity9 could slip into power mr @entity2 ’s appearance at the @entity20 gathering has become an tradition of media scrums , jokes and leadership ambition			1
but with @entity36 ’s position at the helm of the @entity20 party considered more secure , mr @entity2 ’s appearance at a rally tonight was more low key			1
before addressing delegates , he used an interview with @entity42 to go further than before in apparently ruling out rrunning for party leader			0
he said : ‘ i have no such plans			0
’ asked clarify whether he still has ambitions to lead the @entity46			0
‘ ever , now , whenever			0
’ however , he did allow himself to take a mild swipe at mr @entity36 , mocking him for the photo posted on @entity49 by his sister - in - law sleeping next to his red box			1
the photograph was taken by @entity53 as her sister @entity54 prepared for her wedding day and posted on @entity49 , apparently not realising it could be seen by anyone			2
direction : the mayor of @entity11 visited @entity60 , makers of destination boards in @entity63 , during the second day of the @entity20 in @entity21 business : mr @entity2 said investors were drawn to a booming @entity11 , but would be deterred if @entity9 returned to power the @entity11 mayor delivered a typically erratic but joke - filled speech at the conference , where he revealed how he had rejected a request from @entity71 , wife of @entity3 leader @entity72 , to address their party conference			1
‘ it ’s time to lash myself to the mast and resist the siren song of @entity71 , i said to myself , because with a general election less than two years away there is only one relevant fact			0
‘ and that is that her party would deprive me and everyone in my generation of a chance to have a vote on @entity88 in a referendum			0
‘ because they would help to put @entity91 in power , and i do n’t to give back the economic management of this country to the people who were on the bridge when the ship ran aground			0
’ in a sustained attack on the @entity9 , mr @entity2 withdrew his recent remarks claiming @entity103 and @entity91 ‘ belonged to the @entity101 school of helmsmanship ’			2
he added : ‘ i meant the titanic school of economic management , or the @entity106 or the @entity107 or the @entity108			0
‘ or whatever metaphor you pick to convey the scale of the most disastrous economic shipwreck of the last 50 years			0
’ rejection : mr @entity2 revealed he had turned down an invitation to speak at the @entity3 annual conference alongside @entity115 he dismissed criticism from @entity9 ’s @entity117 making comparisons between crime rates in @entity11 and @entity120			1
‘ after 5 years of a @entity20 mayor , with common sense policies of putting more police on the street and increasing patrols we have the murder rate down to the lowest level since 1969 , when @entity117 was n’t even born			2
‘ you are about 20 times more likely to be murdered in @entity120 as in @entity11 , about 4 times more likely to be murdered in @entity130			2
open door : mr @entity2 appeared to go further than previously in ruling out running for @entity20 leader ‘ and you are more than twice as likely to be murdered in sleepy old @entity14 where they have 3 murders per 100,000 as opposed to 1.3 in @entity11			1
‘ @entity135 knows what they are doing there – bumping off their husbands with poisoned profiteroles i expect			0
’ mr @entity2 insisted @entity11 is now the safest global city in the world which is why investors are flocking to the capital , drawn to the upgrades of the @entity145 and @entity146			2
‘ we want to continue in @entity11 with that work , and we do n’t want @entity9 with its 1970s blend of divisiveness and business - bashing and union control			1
‘ what is the definition of a millisecond ? the time it takes @entity91 to follow the instructions of @entity158			0
. ‘ what is the definition of a millimetre ? the distance @entity103 will deviate from union diktat			0
‘ and i say to the charming @entity163 and her friends do n’t vote for @entity3 because we will see this country sleepwalk into a @entity9 government @entity3 if you want to – @entity36 ’s not for kipping not unless , obviously , he ’s at his sister - in - law ’s wedding			1
‘ my friends we are in a far better position than we could have dreamed ; we can win the argument about living standards and show that we are the party with the serious policies to continue creating the conditions for a sustained and durable private sector recovery			0
‘ and we can show that this is the best way to spread opportunity , to generate jobs , to tackle poverty and inequality and to take @entity4 forward			2
‘ we won the argument in @entity11 in 2012 , between short term fool ’s gold and investment in our city ; we are seeing exactly the same pitch from @entity9 in the country as a whole – and i have no doubt we can win in 2015			1
’ putting his feet up : @entity36 is pictured snoozing next to his red box behind his sister - in - law on her wedding day			1
