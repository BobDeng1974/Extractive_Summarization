by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 18 april 2013 @entity2 : 12:08 est , 18 april 2013 smart clothes that change their colour and shape according to the wearer 's movement have been developed by @entity10 experts			1
the ' @entity12 ' project , launched by @entity13 in @entity14 , weaves electronic fabric into clothes allowing the storage of energy from the body			1
the new lines by the team behind the innovation include a dress which can change shape and colour and a shirt which can charge a mobile phone			1
clothes that change their colour and shape according to the wearer 's movement have been developed by @entity10 experts			1
the @entity31 is a transformative garment from the prototype collection prof @entity33 , of the @entity34 at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity10 , said it would be a long time before the clothes hit the high street			2
she said : ' we wo n't see such garments in stores for another 20 or 30 years , but the practical and creative possibilities are exciting			0
' our goal is to create garments that can transform in complex and surprising ways - far beyond reversible jackets , or shirts that change colour in response to heat			1
' @entity50 s why the project is called @entity12			2
' prof @entity33 said the major innovation of this research project is the ability to embed electronic or computer functions within the fibre itself			2
rather than being simply attached to the textile , the electronic components are woven into these new composite fibres			0
the fibres consist of multiple layers of polymers , which , when stretched and drawn out to a small diameter , begin to interact with each other			0
prof @entity33 said the major innovation of this research project is the ability to embed these electronic or computer functions within the fibre itself the use of smart fabrics has already been considered for a wide range of uses , including clothes which can warm the wearer with electronically conducting materials			1
one other suggested use is as a performance device - where the state and shape of the fabric is controlled by someone other than the wearer			0
soldiers ' uniforms could soon use the special yarn , which would be woven directly into the clothing			0
although the garments designed by the university are still years from being made available , prototype designs have been developed to show the concepts in action			0
ms @entity33 's ideas will be presented at the @entity95 2013 conference this week in @entity96 .			0

' @entity12 ' project weaves electronic fabrics into clothes
the material allows for the storage of energy from the body
includes garments that change shape and colour , and can charge phones
