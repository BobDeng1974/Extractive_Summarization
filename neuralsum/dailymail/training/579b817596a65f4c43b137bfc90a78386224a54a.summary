losing weight without dieting or exercising is every slimmer ’s dream come true			0
now , a @entity3 scientist has developed an ' ice jacket ' he claims allows people to burn 500 calories a day - the equivalent of a @entity8 , two snickers bars or four slices of bacon			1
the @entity12 cools the body so it has to work harder to stay warm , burning more calories in the process			1
professor @entity16 , of @entity17 and a visiting scientist at @entity3 ’s @entity19 , claims the jacket will burn 1lb of fat a week when worn for two hours a day			1
in fact , it more than doubles the fat burning achieved from dieting alone , he says			0
these cool the body , forcing it to generate more heat - and burn more calories - to stay warm			1
but because the ice is placed on the shoulders and back , where there are fewer nerve endings , the user does n't feel uncomfortably cold and does n't shiver , professor @entity16 claims the jacket is kept in the freezer , so when it is taken out and put on the skin it will be the same temperature as the freezer			1
the ice melts to 0 ° c and cools the back , neck and shoulders , where most of the body 's fat - burning and heat - generating ' brown ' fat is found			1
@entity53 fat burns more calories when the body is cold ' it could be used for people trying to lose weight , or for damage control , offsetting a temporary binge such as over the holidays , ' he told @entity63 ' my wife intends to use it for post-childbirth weight loss			2
' the jacket is a waistcoat which drapes gel packs of ice over the shoulders and across the back			2
it is kept in the freezer so it remains chilled - and should then be worn when a person is at a comfortable temperature and not exercising			0
‘ if you are sitting down at rest in a room ( or your car , or whatever ) that is at a comfortable temperature , ’ professor @entity16 told @entity63			2
‘ then wearing @entity86 directly from the freezer , and with a shirt underneath , will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm			1
’ the vest will not work if a person is in a hot environment , or if are exercising , as it will simply keep the user cool but not force their body to burn more calories to stay warm , he warned			1
he claims the jacket is n't particularly uncomfortable to wear			0
' the first time you wear it , yes , it 'll feel cold , ' he said			0
' but you wo n’t shiver			0
after trying it a few times , you ’ll hardly notice you ’re wearing it			0
' the comfort factor is the incentive for wearing the jacket and not turning off the heating , he said			0
the @entity12 jacket drapes ice over the back and shoulders			2
under the skin of the shoulders and back is where most of the body ’s brown fat , or brown adipose tissue , is found			1
adults have a small amount of this brown or ‘ good ’ fat in this area			0
the jacket can help people burn 500 calories a day - a pound a week , professor @entity16 says this fat is different to the white fat , which is amassed from gorging on too many calories			1
@entity53 fat is made of several fat droplets and large numbers of iron - containing mitochondria , which – along with blood vessels – is which is what gives the fat its brownish appearance			0
it burns calories to generate heat , and burns calories when a person enters mild cold			1
professor @entity16 claims cooling the body will force brown fat to burn more calories to generate heat			1
his own clinical trials found wearing the @entity12 vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than a person would burn without it			1
that 's the equivalent of 1lb a week			2
' if you turn off your heating in winter your whole body will be cold and you 'll be uncomfortable			0
this way you wo n't be uncomfortable			0
it 's a " cheat 's way " of being cold , ' he told @entity63			0
the jacket works using a phenomenon known as mild cold exposure , which professor @entity16 said has long been studied by scientists			1
‘ any mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories , whether it ’s a cold day outside , air conditioning set too high , or your skin being in contact with a cold object , ’ he said			1
he added : ‘ scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades , and it ’s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn			0
' the shoulders and back is the most comfortable place to put the ice because that ’s where the body has the fewest nerve endings , he explained			2
mild cold exposure has no known side effects , and has long been studied by scientists as a way to burn calories , professor @entity16 said			1
however , he warns it is not a panacea for weight loss as its effect can easily be nullified by eating an extra 500 calories this area is also where most of the body ’s brown fat , or brown adipose tissue is found			1
adults have a small amount of this brown or ‘ good ’ fat in this area			0
this fat is different to the white fat , which is amassed from gorging on too many calories			0
@entity53 fat is made of several fat droplets and large numbers of iron - containing mitochondria , which – along with blood vessels – is which is what gives the fat its brownish appearance			0
it burns calories to generate heat , and burns calories when a person enters mild cold			1
therefore cooling the area of the body where brown fat is found – the back and shoulders – will force brown fat to burn more calories to generate heat , professor @entity16 said			1
@entity8 : 550 calories half a tub ( 500ml ) of @entity235 's @entity234 ice cream : 555 two @entity237 bars : 500 calories four slices of streaky bacon : 500 calories bottle of @entity243 wine : 595 calories he warns that too much cold exposure can be fatal			1
‘ on the other hand , mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy , and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories			2
’ his own clinical trials , of eight people , found wearing the @entity12 vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than a person would burn without it			2
however , he warns the jacket is not a panacea to weight loss - it can simply aid fat burning for people who are reducing their calorie intake			2
he said : ' the vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed , but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 calories			2
' so do n't expect that you can continue to eat junk food , wear the vest , and lose weight			0
' and while it might seem like an extreme way to lose weight , he argues it ’s no more wacky than other methods			0
he said : ‘ think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat			0
starving themselves ? while cooling the body might seem like an extreme way of burning calories , professor @entity16 ( pictured ) argues it is no more wacky than other methods such as starving oneself , wearing a corset or liposuction ‘ eating zero - calorie clay just to feel full , which carries a risk of arsenic poising ? exhausting themselves in the gym ? ingesting questionable supplements that , if they work at all , have side effects like insomnia or over ‐ stimulation ? ‘ how about wearing a corset just to appear thinner ? drug injections ? @entity305 ? freezing fat cells ? @entity308 ‐ intestinal surgery ? ’ he concluded : ‘ considering these options , wearing a cool , calorie - burning vest is pretty tame in comparison			1
’ the jacket costs $ 160 and will be available in sizes xs to @entity315			0

professor @entity16 , of @entity17 , developed the jacket
it cools the body , forcing it to generate more heat to stay warm
professor @entity16 claims it can burn 500 extra calories a day , or 1lb a week
that 's the equivalent of a @entity8 or half a tub of @entity235 's ice cream
this is because it activate 's the body 's brown or ' healthy fat ' - found on the shoulders and back - which burns calories when cold
