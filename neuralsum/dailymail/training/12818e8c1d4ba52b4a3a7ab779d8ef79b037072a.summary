by @entity0 published : 04:12 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 05:14 est , 11 june 2013 cleared : @entity1 , 48 , of @entity3 , was told the case would be dropped because all three allegations amounted to less than one minute of contact in total a science teacher admitted he was ' stabbed in the back ' by three of his female pupils who maliciously accused him of sexual assault after he leaned over them during chemistry lessons			1
@entity1 , 48 , who was a teacher for 24 years , was yesterday cleared of touching three girls aged 11 to 16 for his sexual gratification			1
mr @entity1 - who was also head of science at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity3 - was repeatedly told the case would be dropped because all three allegations amounted to less than one minute of contact			1
but instead he was hauled through the courts , suspended from his £ 38,000 - a - year job , and forced to wait 15 months to prove his innocence			1
after a six - day trial which cost nearly £ 100,000 , a jury agreed with mr @entity1 's case that his contact with the girls was accidental and innocent			1
one pupil had even gone to the headteacher of the school to stop the case because he thought it was malicious - but the boy was not listened to			1
mr @entity1 spoke outside @entity34 yesterday after being found not guilty of two charges of sexual assault , one of sexual activity with a child and another of indecent assault			1
he said : ‘ i have been through 15 months of hell for no good reason			2
it should never have come to court			2
i knew i was innocent			2
my lawyers kept saying it would be dropped , but no - one wanted to make that common sense decision			2
‘ my thoughts were only for the children ’s welfare			0
when i moved around the classroom to lean over children it was only in the proper context			0
‘ you do n’t expect a knife in the back from a child , but innocent teachers run a daily risk of having their lives destroyed by false claims from children			0
i am afraid the teaching profession is under siege from similar complaints			0
’ and magistrate @entity69 , a former teacher whose daughter was taught by mr @entity1 , said : ‘ i had no doubt about his innocence , but he has paid a high price			1
' the one thing that has struck me about this case is the girls have remained anonymous , but his personal life has been pilloried			1
’ the case was sparked by a girl who told a friend she would ‘ get him done ’ for touching her hair while using a paper towel to remove ink sprayed on her face by a disruptive pupil in a lesson			1
she was unhappy that he had moved hair out of the way and told her mother , saying he had put his hand near her crotch and brushed her thigh			2
mr @entity1 denied any touching had taken place at all			1
he said the girl had not liked it when he told her to take her coat off in a lesson and she had refused			2
school : mr @entity1 had been teaching at @entity16 ( pictured ) in @entity17 , @entity3 he said it had been a battle not worth fighting because she was part of a troubling group who were working			1
a male classmate of the girl told the jury he saw her outside immediately after the incident			2
the boy said she was grinning and initially claimed it had been an accident			0
but when challenged about reporting the touching , the pupil claimed she told him : ‘ i do n’t care			1
i do n’t like him ’ he said he was so concerned he went to the headteacher , but could not stop the case progressing			1
the boy added that mr @entity1 had already been suspended , but over the coming weeks he found the girl ’s account was changing as she told it to other people			1
he said : ‘ he was a good teacher one of the best i had for science			2
i never saw him behave in a sexually inappropriate way			0
i heard her tell three or four different accounts to people			0
i thought there was something odd about this			2
she did not seem distraught in any way			0
’ ' innocent teachers run a daily risk of having their lives destroyed by false claims from children ' @entity1 mr @entity1 told the jury : ‘ i am an enthusiastic and dedicated teacher who has a child ’s best possible interests at heart			1
i always aimed to get them to fulfil their potential			0
’ the jury heard there were two other complaints from girls of touching as he leant across them			1
one girl claimed he pull a paper towel out from under her bottom and touched her buttock			0
mr @entity1 said the girls had made up the allegations			1
he told police one girl was probably just after compensation because she only came forward after reading about his arrest in the local newspaper			2
on the main complaint where he was said to have brushed her hair sexually , he said : ‘ she asked me where the ink was			0
it could easily have gone in her eye			0
legal process : after a six - day trial at @entity34 ( pictured ) , which cost neatly £ 100,000 , a jury took less than three hours to agree with mr @entity1 's case that his contact with the girls was accidental and innocent ‘ the contact with the paper towel was a few seconds			1
it was not sexually motivated			0
i got no pleasure from it			0
i was far from happy at the time			0
i wanted her to get back to work			0
’ @entity1 will now have his suspension reviewed , the local council confirmed today			1
director of children , family and adult services at @entity188 , @entity189 , said : ‘ the overriding concern of the council is the health and welfare of @entity3 pupils			0
‘ as soon as the council is advised of an accusation against a member of staff or anyone working with children , immediate action is taken to safeguard the young people concerned and the police are informed			0
‘ i would urge anyone who has any concerns about someone to speak up and all calls made to the @entity206 are always treated in the strictest of confidence			0
@entity188 will be reviewing mr @entity1 's suspension following the conclusion of the court proceedings			1
’ he told the court there were 23 students in most of his classes and he treated boys the same as girls , adding : ‘ it is best practice to circulate as much as possible when teaching			2
‘ i accept it means coming into close proximity with students			0
it is impossible to read their work if you do n’t get to their eye line			0
i place myself in a position where i could see their work			0
’ eleven members of staff and nine former pupils gave glowing character references to the jury			0
a 19 - year - old @entity239 chemistry student , said : ‘ he is a very good teacher and easy to get along with			1
he gave up his lunch times to help with revision only two other teachers did that			0
’ defence barrister @entity244 told the jury mr @entity1 had worked his way up through the school to his job without criticism			1
he said schools were the worst place for @entity253 whispers - which could produce the most sinister meanings			2
mr @entity244 added that mr @entity1 ’s character references showed he did not have a bad reputation and the allegations were not credible			2
mr @entity1 himself said after the case that he was waiting to discover whether he will be re-instated in his job and wanted the case out of the way to return in september			1
he added that despite adverse headlines in the local newspaper , he had not suffered in the street from taunts and found a huge amount of support from people .			0
