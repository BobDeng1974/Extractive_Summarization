@entity1 's curiosity rover has captured the passing of @entity4 ' two miniature moons in a fascinating photo sequence taken from the surface of the red planet			1
the eclipse of the moons - @entity10 - was captured for the first time from @entity4 using @entity0 's telephoto - lens camera and it is so detailed that craters are visible			1
the larger moon , @entity15 , passes in front of @entity17 in the 30 - second video comprised of 41 images taken by the robotic vehicle that were stitched together by scientists working at @entity1 's @entity22			1
the video will enable scientists to learn more about the moons , including giving a more precise picture of the moons ' orbits			0
@entity46 of @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' the ultimate goal is to improve orbit knowledge enough that we can improve the measurement of the tides @entity15 raises on the @entity4 solid surface , giving knowledge of the @entity4 interior			0
' ' we may also get data good enough to detect density variations within @entity15 and to determine if @entity17 ' orbit is systematically changing , ' he said			0
the orbit of the larger moon , @entity15 , is slowly getting closer to @entity4 , while smaller @entity17 ' orbit is gradually moving away from the red planet			1
@entity15 has a diameter of less than one per cent of the @entity67 's moon and it orbits much closer to @entity4 than our moon 's distance from @entity67			2
the larger of @entity4 ' moons measures just 22 kilometres in diameter but orbits just 3,700 miles from @entity4 ' surface			0
when viewed from the surface of @entity4 , @entity15 looks about half as wide the @entity67 's moon appears to viewers on @entity67 , according to the scientists			2
the larger of the two moons ( pictured ) , @entity15 , passes in front of @entity17 in the 30 - second video comprised of 41 images taken by the robotic vehicle that were stitched together by scientists working at @entity1 's @entity22			1
here @entity15 is seen just before the eclipse here , @entity15 eclipses @entity17 , as seen by the @entity0 on @entity4			1
the smaller moon becomes visible once more in the right - hand image the @entity67 's moon is vast compared to the @entity4 moons , with a diameter of around 2,160 miles but orbits much further away from it 's planet 's surface at an average of 239,000 miles			2
dr @entity46 and his colleagues said the two moons would be visible crossing paths at a time shortly after @entity0 would be awake for transmitting data to @entity1 's @entity95 for relay to @entity67			1
this made the moon observations feasible with minimal impact on the rover 's energy budget			0
@entity1 's @entity104 project is using @entity0 and the rover 's 10 science instruments to investigate the environmental history within @entity108 , a location where the project has found that conditions were long ago favorable for microbial life			2
this illustration provides a comparison for how big the moons of @entity4 appear to be , as seen from the surface of @entity4 , in relation to how big the @entity67 's moon looks from the surface of @entity67			0
@entity67 's moon actually has a diameter more than 100 times greater than the larger @entity4 moon , @entity15 the rover recently celebrated its first anniversary on @entity4 by using its @entity123 at @entity4 ( @entity125 ) instrument to ' sing ' @entity126 by vibrating at different frequencies			1
since completing its dramatic landing sequence just over a year ago , the rover has already achieved its mission aim by discovering that @entity4 could have supported life and is sending back information about its surroundings to inform future missions to @entity4			0
the mobile laboratory has provided more than 190 gigabits of data , returned more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images , fired more than 75,000 laser shots to investigate the composition of targets , collected and analyzed sample material from two rocks and driven more than one mile			0
@entity1 's @entity104 project is using @entity0 ( a computer - generated illustration is pictured ) landed on @entity4 in august last year for a two - year mission to determine if the planet most like @entity67 in the solar system has , or ever had , the an environment to sustain life the rover has travelled almost 700 metres in the past month since leaving an area of @entity4 where it has been analysing rocks for around six months			1
@entity151 is now trundling along to its final destination - @entity152 - where it will look at the lower layers of the mountain that towers over the centre of @entity108 by almost three and a half miles			0
@entity152 is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet 's changing environment over time .			0

@entity1 's @entity22 said the larger of the two moons , @entity15 , passed in front of @entity17 on 1 august
scientists *created* a video of the event by stitchng together 41 images taken by the @entity0 on @entity4
first time the @entity4 moon eclipse has been captured from the red planet
