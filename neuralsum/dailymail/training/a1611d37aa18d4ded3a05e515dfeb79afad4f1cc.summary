by @entity0 according to the film @entity2 , 2015 is supposed to be the year of the flying car			0
but if you 're thinking that flying cars arriving as early as next year sounds a bit far - fetched , then you might want to check out proposals from @entity8			1
he claims his design , known as the @entity11 , could be the air - borne method of transport we were promised by @entity15 and @entity16 's time travelling exploits			1
we have all imagined the concept of flying cars whizzing past us in the future			0
this idea has been explored by scientists and certainly in futuristic films , however @entity8 has taken the idea a step further with his creation called the @entity11 ( pictured ) the @entity11 is essentially a personal helicopter designed to transport us around cities in a much more efficient and eco-friendly way than relying on driving or waiting for a bus			1
portable nuclear fusion reactors flying cars self - tying shoes changeable window scenery weather forecasts accurate to the second self - drying clothes automated petrol stations @entity40 @entity8 said for now , he hopes that this concept will inspire creative people working within the transportation industry to consider developing alternative means of eco-friendly travel in crowded places			1
the designer noticed that urban traffic is becoming increasingly busy and starting to overflow as the urban population in busy cities continue to grow			1
' the pollution caused by co2 emission is making the urban atmosphere worse each time , ' he says			0
' in @entity55 , this year , government provided public transportation for free and asked people to not use their cars for three days in an attempt of battle against the intense pollution of the air			2
' also in this year , in @entity64 , giant lcd panels were used to show a virtual sunset to pedestrians , while the city was evolved in a very dense and polluted atmosphere hiding the natural horizon			0
' look familiar ? the concept of a flying personal vehicle with a spherical roof was popularised by the cartoon @entity74 , which had some rather fantastical visions of the future on @entity77 the @entity11 is essentially a personal helicopter designed to transport us around cities in a much more efficient and eco-friendly way than relying on driving or waiting for a bus @entity8 said for now , he hopes that this concept will inspire creative people working within the transportation industry to consider developing alternative means of eco-friendly travel in crowded places the inventor points out how cities across the world , including @entity93 , experienced terrible fog and pollution in april this year			1
dimensions : 20.8 x 17.1 x 18 feet ( 6.34 x 5.20 x 5.49 metres ) weight : 2,450 pounds ( 1,110 kilograms ) @entity98 : 12,000 feet ( 3,600 metres ) @entity99 : 120 miles ( 190 kilometres ) per hour range : 300 miles ( 480 kilometres ) baggage loading : 210 pounds ( 95 kilograms ) ready to fly in 1 minute however he believes that we are experiencing a ' strong wave of green energy ' , representing a human effort to challenge global warming			1
and he claims that his personal helicopters could be part of this green revolution , providing people with greener and easier ways of getting to work			1
using fans and electric engines , the portable vehicles would limit the creation of pollutants			0
by simply blowing air , @entity8 hopes they would help to alleviate the waste chemicals that are leaked by cars in urban centres at the moment			1
the vehicle would be powered by electricity and recharged by the sun using solar cells			0
it would be similar in flight and handling to a helicopter , albeit cheaper , easier to control , quieter and smoother thanks to its multiple fans according to @entity8			2
while it can be controlled manually , it can also apparently go into autopilot mode for take - off , flight and landing			0
it would be made from carbon , aluminium and titanium , with its side coated in solar cells			0
however , he is n't in the process of building the vehicle at the moment			0
for now , he says the concept is ' just to inspire creative people from the industry of transportation about another possible way to make a new reality come true '			2
' the pollution caused by co2 emission is making the urban atmosphere worse each time , ' says @entity8			2
' in @entity55 , this year , government provided public transportation for free and asked people to not use their cars for three days in an attempt of battle against the intense pollution of the air '			0

designer @entity8 has *unveiled* his concept for air vehicles
known as the @entity11 , he says it could let people commute by air
it builds on visions from popular *culture* such as @entity177
he claims his design could be part of a ' strong wave of green energy '
personal helicopters would transport us around cities and alleviate traffic
