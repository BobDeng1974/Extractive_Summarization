@entity0 let mounting criticism of his @entity3 holiday wash over him today - by going body boarding			1
opponents have accused the prime minister of complacency over the @entity9 crisis and have publicly demanded that he return to @entity10 to get a grip on the developing crisis in @entity9			1
mr @entity0 only returned to @entity13 on wednesday morning , following the brutal execution of hostage @entity15 - but went back to the @entity17 just 19 hours later			1
he returned to his holiday after a 19 - hour dash to @entity13 mr @entity0 today appeared to put the stresses of high office to one side , by joining fellow holidaymakers riding the waves on a beach in @entity3			1
it comes after the @entity33 sparked anger in the @entity35 after being pictured laughing with friends on a golf course just hours after describing the beheading of mr @entity15 ' an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world '			1
images of mr @entity0 playing in the surf come amid mounting pressure for a recall of @entity48 to deal with the growing threat of @entity51 insurgents sweeping through @entity9 and @entity52			1
in the latest developments , foreign secretary @entity53 , who has been left in charge of the situation while mr @entity0 is in @entity3 , last night ruled out a deal with @entity52 ’s @entity58 – despite warnings it will be impossible to defeat @entity51 fanatics without his help			1
dealing with the tyrant , who has killed tens of thousands of his people , would poison @entity66 ’s wider diplomatic efforts in the @entity67 , he said			2
‘ i ’ve said very often that one of the first things you learn in the @entity67 is that my enemy ’s enemy is not necessarily my friend			1
‘ we may very well find that we are aligned against a common enemy , but that does n’t make us friends			2
‘ it does n’t make us able to trust them , it does n’t enable us to work with them			2
it would poison what we are trying to achieve in separating moderate @entity84 opinion from the poisonous ideology of @entity86			0
’ surfing safari : @entity0 clutches his body board as he walks across the beach after time in the sea despite the protestations , some kind of deal might be reached , with the independent newspaper reporting that the @entity35 has already supplied @entity58 ’s forces with intelligence about the location of jihadi leaders – allowing @entity52 aircraft and artillery to target them			1
the newspaper claims the @entity104 intelligence service , the @entity105 , had been used as a back channel for the communications			0
the prime minister returned to @entity13 for emergency meetings with the foreign secretary on wednesday morning after a video was published online of the brutal beheading of mr @entity15 by a jihadi thought to be @entity66			1
mr @entity0 is believed to have ordered the security services to track down mr @entity15 's @entity66 killers , but pledged not to offer a ' knee jerk ' response to the murder			1
speaking from @entity13 , mr @entity0 said : ' let me condemn the barbaric and brutal act that has taken place and let 's be clear what this act is - it is an act of murder , and murder without any justification			1
' just 19 hours later however @entity10 announced that mr @entity0 was on his way back to @entity3 to join his third family holiday of the year - and his fifteenth since becoming prime minister			1
mr @entity0 today took to the water in a three quarter - length wet suit and brightly - coloured bodyboard after hiring boards from a local trader			0
an onlooker said : ' he seemed pretty relaxed and having a good time by himself			2
' he did n't do any real surfing - the conditions were n't really there for it - but he had a go on the body board a couple of times			2
wet and wild : wet suit wearing @entity0 turned a few heads as he strolled along the sand after a dip the pm was pictured back on the beach hours after being accused of complacency over the @entity9 crisis crashing the waves : @entity0 decided to go back to his holiday instead of handling the crisis in @entity13 ' the weather was pretty good - rather sunny - and he took full advantage of it			1
' another onlooker said : ' he then walked down the beach and happily spent around 20 minutes body boarding in the sea			1
' the waves were over a metre high so there was a bit of surf to play in			0
he seemed to really enjoy himself			0
after a while they all got out and walked back up the beach			0
' after the surf session mr @entity0 left in his security convoy			0
government sources have insisted that he remains in full touch with @entity177 during his break with a secure phone line set up for his stay			0
but critics accused the prime minister of a dereliction of duty – and questioned why he has refused to recall @entity48 to debate mr @entity15 ’s murder and the threat to security posed by jihadis who return to the @entity66			1
in the @entity35 , president @entity33 faced similar criticism after he was pictured smiling on the golf course within minutes of giving a speech condemning the murder			0
mr @entity33 's decision to return to the golf course just hours after giving a sombre five minute address over the killing of mr @entity15 sparked fury in the @entity35			1
the president told a global audience that ' when people harm @entity35 , anywhere , we do what ’s necessary to see that justice is done '			0
but he was then seen laughing with friends and fist - bumping them during a five - hour round at @entity204 on @entity205 in @entity206			0
@entity208 lieutenant colonel @entity207 could hardly contain his anger wednesday night on the @entity210 as he discussed @entity33 's reactions to the @entity214 terror network 's beheading of @entity15 , an @entity35 who had been missing since 2012			1
' there is no way the president should be stupid enough to go play golf ' after such a somber speech , @entity207 said			0
@entity0 's security team watched the @entity222 from the beach while he enjoyed the surf for 20 minutes ' not only did he insult the @entity15 family ; he sent a message to @entity227 ( the leader of @entity214 ) and all of the other jihadi terrorist militants – now soldiers of a jihadi army – that he does n't take it all seriously			1
' @entity233 mp @entity232 , former @entity66 human rights envoy to @entity9 , was equally furious about mr @entity0 's decision to return to his holiday in @entity66			2
she said : ‘ i just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in @entity238 – it is just not good enough			2
' if he is serious about the threat to @entity66 , as he says he is and as he ought to be , then he should not be pushing off on holiday			0
he should be recalling mps to @entity48 so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response			0
' meanwhile , former @entity208 chief @entity247 , once a defence adviser to @entity0 , said the @entity17 would have to talk to @entity58 if it was serious about destroying @entity86			2
‘ the @entity52 dimension has got to be addressed , ’ he said			2
‘ you can not deal with half a problem			2
whether it is above the counter or below the counter , a conversation has got to be held with him			0
‘ because if there is going to be any question of air strikes over @entity52 airspace it ’s got to be with the @entity58 regime ’s approval			1
’ he spoke as defence chiefs put the @entity264 - based @entity263 on ‘ high readiness ’ to deploy to @entity266 , as special forces focus on identifying is commanders and @entity66 recruits			0
@entity270 and sand : but critics accused the prime minister of a dereliction of duty and questioned why he has refused to recall @entity48 to debate mr @entity15 ’s murder and the threat to security posed by jihadis in the @entity35 , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff @entity279 said is strongholds in @entity52 , as well as @entity9 , would ‘ have to be addressed ’			1
@entity35 defence secretary @entity282 said the extremist group was ‘ beyond anything we have seen ’ and suggested that strikes in @entity52 would be necessary to defeat them			2
but mr @entity53 was backed by @entity288 mp @entity287 , chairman of the commons defence committee , who said : ‘ i would be very , very cautious about seeing @entity58 as an ally			1
‘ he is completely unreliable and he may have his own reasons for wanting to keep is in place in some form , because their presence relieves the pressure for regime change			0
’ fellow @entity288 @entity297 , who has just returned from northern @entity9 , said : ‘ the real issue , unpalatable as it is , is working with @entity299 , which holds much more sway in the region			2
’ however , former foreign secretary sir @entity302 said : ‘ you can not get rid of the @entity305 terrorist in northern @entity9 and allow them to have safe haven in @entity52			1
‘ we are all determined to get rid of this ghastly @entity310 caliphate state which carried out such savage acts of terrorism and which is such a threat			0
we ’ve got to be serious about it and swallow hard as to what is required to do that			0
’ the government is under growing pressure to reintroduce anti-terror control orders to stop radicalised @entity66 going overseas to fight or plotting attacks at home			0
independent terror watchdog @entity324 , his predecessor @entity321 and @entity323 criticised the @entity326 for axing control orders in 2011			0
these were replaced by weaker powers – @entity330 – which allowed terror suspects more freedom so as not to breach their human rights			0
but not a single person is currently covered by the measures , designed to protect the public from fanatics who can not be jailed			0
a @entity339 spokesman said : ‘ we introduced @entity341 precisely because control orders were not working and their powers were being struck down by the courts			0
‘ people seeking to travel to engage in terrorist activity in @entity52 or @entity9 should be in no doubt we will take the strongest possible action			1

the pm took time off dealing with @entity9 crisis to go body boarding in @entity3
he returned to @entity13 following @entity15 's execution *yesterday*
but returned after just 19 hours in @entity238 and critics say he 's ' complacent '
meanwhile , foreign secretary has ruled out deal with @entity52 @entity58
@entity53 said ' my enemy 's enemy is not necessarily my friend '
