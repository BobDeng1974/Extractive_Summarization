@entity1 's outstanding second - half performance for @entity2 against @entity3 on tuesday night has put him on course to become the longest - serving outfield player to represent the @entity2 behind sir @entity6			1
@entity1 made his @entity2 debut against @entity8 in may 2001 as a teenager with @entity10 and if – as now seems likely – he carries through to @entity11 , he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary sir @entity6 to have an international career spanning more than 15 years			1
@entity6 won his 54 @entity2 caps over a 23 - year period between 1934 and 1957 , interrupted of course by the @entity17			2
@entity1 's appearance for @entity2 against @entity3 on tuesday night keeps him in the longest - serving list @entity1 has played for @entity2 for 13 years , 310 days - while sir @entity6 reached 22 years , 228 days sir @entity6 runs with the ball in action for @entity2 against @entity22 at @entity23 in an international friendly @entity6 ( 1934 - 57 ) 22 yrs , 228 days @entity25 ( 1970 - 90 ) 19 yrs , 224 days @entity26 ( 1999 - 2014 ) 14 yrs , 257 days @entity27 ( 2000 - 2014 ) 14 yrs , 23 days @entity28 ( 1988 - 2002 ) 13 yrs , 335 days @entity1 ( 2001 - ) 13 yrs , 310 days ... and the legends he @entity30 @entity31 ( 1996 - 2009 ) – 13 yrs , 43 days sir @entity33 ( 1958 - 70 ) 12 yrs , 23 days @entity34 ( 1962 - 73 ) 11 yrs , 178 days @entity35 ( 1984 - 1992 ) 8 yrs , 22 days @entity1 was hailed by @entity37 team - mate @entity36 as ' the best player on the pitch by a mile ' after the 33 - year - old was introduced as a half - time substitute in @entity42 and helped @entity44 's men fight back to earn a 1 - 1 draw			1
his longevity already surpasses that of great names like sir @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity31 and @entity35 and if he continues to play in the next @entity49 he will overtake @entity27 and @entity26 too			0
the only player to have had a longer career since @entity6 is goalkeeper @entity25 who played for @entity2 between 1971 and 1990			2
it also begs the question why @entity1 , who has won four @entity55 titles and the @entity56 with @entity37 , has been used so sparingly by his country at international tournaments			0
he played once at the 2006 @entity59 in a 1 - 0 victory against @entity61 , was in the squad but never played by @entity63 in the disastrous 2010 campaign in @entity65 , and was n't even selected by @entity44 last year in @entity22 , even though @entity2 's perennial problem has been keeping the ball			0
with @entity36 now captain and clearly a huge fan of the midfielder , it seems unlikely @entity1 will be overlooked again and is now finally getting the recognition he deserves			0
the 33 - year - old may still have a few years left but remains a long way off sir @entity6 's record @entity1 ( left ) pictured with @entity2 team - mates @entity78 ( centre ) and @entity80 ( right ) vs @entity3 , march 31 , 2015 vs @entity81 , mar 27 , 2015 vs @entity82 , october 15 , 2013 vs @entity83 , october 11 , 2013 vs @entity22 , june 2 , 2013 vs @entity84 , may 29 , 2013 vs @entity83 , march 26 , 2013 vs @entity82 , october 17 , 2012 vs @entity85 , october 12 , 2012 vs @entity86 , september 12 , 2012 vs @entity3 , august 15 , 2012 vs @entity8 , may 24 , 2010 vs @entity87 , march 3 , 2010 vs @entity88 , october 10 , 2009 vs @entity89 , september 5 , 2009 vs @entity90 , august 12 , 2009 vs @entity91 , march 28 , 2009 vs @entity92 , february 11 , 2009 vs @entity93 , november 19 , 2008 vs @entity93 , august 22 , 2007 vs @entity22 , june 1 , 2007 vs @entity92 , february 7 , 2007 vs @entity90 , november 15 , 2006 vs @entity94 , october 11 , 2006 vs @entity95 , october 7 , 2006 vs @entity95 , september 6 , 2006 vs @entity61 , june 25 , 2006 vs @entity96 , june 3 , 2006 vs @entity97 , march 1 , 2006 vs @entity98 , may 31 , 2005 vs @entity99 , may 28 , 2005 vs @entity90 , august 15 , 2001 vs @entity8 , may 25 , 2001			1
