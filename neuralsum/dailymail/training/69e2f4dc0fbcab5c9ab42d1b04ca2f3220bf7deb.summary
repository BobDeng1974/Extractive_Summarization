by @entity0 @entity1 should n’t be keeping pace in this title race			1
with three forwards who have managed just eight league goals between them , they should be watching @entity7 disappear into the distance			1
but @entity1 — the team i tipped for the title at the start of the season — are right in the thick of it because they have the ultimate big - game manager			1
do not underestimate how influential @entity15 will be as the season reaches its climax			1
energised : @entity1 manager @entity15 always comes alive for the big games title favourites : many are expecting @entity7 to run away with the league in the second half of the season showdowns like sunday ’s with @entity25 make @entity15 tick			1
he comes alive in the build - up and has a way of dominating the agenda			1
as an opposition player , it complicates things as you find yourself thinking about him as much as the players you have to stop in the game			1
i said on this page earlier in the season how i felt @entity15 was ‘ the different one ’ but time has proved he is , in many respects , the same as when he first arrived here nine years ago			1
take what happened with @entity42 against @entity43 last month			0
@entity42 should have been sent off and should also have given a penalty away yet @entity15 managed to flip the post-match narrative to attack @entity48 ’s diving and the number of former @entity43 players working in the media ! mind games : @entity15 deflected attention away from @entity42 's apparent trip on @entity48 last month the main similarity between the @entity15 of then and now comes from his ability to deliver in the season - shaping contests			1
when @entity1 won back - to - back titles during his first reign , his record against @entity59 , @entity25 and @entity43 was almost exemplary			1
he knows what it takes to find a result when it matters and , over those first two campaigns , @entity1 took 29 points off their main rivals , winning nine and drawing two of the 12 games			1
you can see why he has won nine of the 12 major cup finals he has contested during his managerial career			0
@entity15 is repeating the trick			1
each time @entity1 have faced a defining match in the @entity76 this year , @entity15 has come up with the right solution			1
some will argue his teams are not always the most attractive but they are absolutely effective			0
it started in his second match when he set up a team with no strikers to get a point at @entity84			0
a month later at @entity88 , the introduction of @entity86 at half - time was the catalyst to turn a one - goal deficit into a 1 - 1 draw , even though @entity1 finished with 10 men			1
he then coaxed a last - gasp 2 - 1 home win against @entity7 in october , flooded the midfield at @entity59 to get a 0 - 0 draw before @entity96 then played to the gallery in the 2 - 1 win over @entity43 , whipping up the fans and inspiring his players			1
that was always the thing about tackling @entity1			1
you never felt like you were just facing 11 men — you felt you had to play him , too			0
sir @entity105 had a habit of appearing on the touchline at key moments and @entity15 is a master of that , too			1
he also knows how to play mind games , which is why i smiled when i read his comments about how he had ‘ heard ’ things were ‘ not happy ’ at @entity84			2
there was also a casual remark that @entity25 are ‘ out of the title race ’			2
@entity15 used to say things like that all the time about @entity43			1
i remember him complaining about @entity1 not getting a penalty in the first leg of the @entity123 semi-final in 2007 when @entity124 accidentally handled outside the area			1
@entity15 kept saying how he hoped @entity1 ‘ would n’t be crying about another big decision ’ in the return			1
he was relentless , so the only way to take him on was with humour			0
before the second leg , i said he was the funniest thing to come out of @entity132 since @entity133 and @entity134			0
gearing up : @entity15 puts his players through their paces at @entity1 's @entity138 training ground on friday we had @entity1 ’s number then — we beat them in three semi-finals in three years — and the wins were extra special as he would have tried everything to grind you down			1
when he left in 2007 , we felt even more confident about beating them , even though they were essentially still his team			0
maybe @entity15 had a point to prove when he came back this summer after the two @entity149 clubs looked elsewhere for new managers			1
but he is working like a man on a mission and whatever he is doing , it is working			0
he has hardly made any changes to a squad that in the past two seasons finished 25 points then 14 points off the title winners , yet here they are bang in contention , just two points off the lead and getting stronger			2
of course , they have some top performers			0
@entity165 told me 18 months ago that @entity167 would blossom into a star and he has taken his game up a level after a slow start to the season			0
star in the making : @entity167 's game has come on since @entity15 took over at @entity176 if he maintains this vein of form , he could challenge @entity48 when the individual honours are handed out later on			1
aside from inspiring hazard , his handling of @entity86 — not selecting a crowd favourite — has been proved correct by results and the impact of @entity185 and @entity186			0
the biggest impact of all , however , has come from @entity15			1
should @entity1 win tomorrow , @entity15 will have his 100th @entity76 victory			1
it would be symbolic , as his first came against @entity25 in 2004			0
it would be a record , too , as it would only have taken 141 matches to get there			0
for context , @entity105 needed 162 ; @entity196 took 179 matches			0
but , above all , it would also be ominous for @entity1 ’s rivals			2
@entity7 might be exciting with all their goals but they ca n’t , for one moment , be considered title certainties			1
not when @entity15 ’s influence remains stronger than ever			2
pointing the finger : @entity15 shouts at @entity0 during the 2005 @entity206 final kick politics out of football so , @entity209 won the @entity210 but what we really saw at the glittering award ceremony in @entity214 was the politics of the voting system laid bare			2
do n’t think what happened is something new			0
in fact , i ’d go as far as to say it happens at every club in the country when the @entity225 forms are handed out			0
put it this way : if @entity43 had someone in the running for the @entity231 award , or the @entity233 award , the ‘ rule ’ in the dressing room would be : do not vote for any of their rivals			0
proud moment : @entity239 frontman @entity209 poses with the @entity210 on monday night here is an example : @entity48 has an outstanding chance of winning the @entity225 award this season			0
seeing as you ca n’t pick anyone from your own club , i would n’t expect any @entity43 player to choose @entity250 , @entity167 or @entity251 as their selection			0
i ’m not saying @entity209 did n’t deserve to win the @entity210 for the second time , as he had an astonishing year and his consistency and endurance have been remarkable , but there should be a way of making the award even more significant			0
votes for the @entity210 should be taken away from national coaches and captains and it should be left exclusively to journalists , as it used to be			0
leading contenders : but @entity250 ( left ) and @entity48 ( right ) will be hindered by the voting process @entity43 ’s game with @entity268 this evening carries particular significance for me , as it is 17 years to the day since i marked my first start in a red shirt with a goal in front of @entity274			0
it was a day i will never forget — we won 3 - 0 — and i ’m sure the players i ’ve picked out here would say the same			2
1 @entity279 : one of the great strikers of the modern era served notice of what was to come when , on his full debut in april 1988 ( below ) , he scored three for @entity286 against @entity59 in a 4 - 2 win			2
aged 17 , he became the youngest player , at that time , to score a hat - trick in the top flight			2
2 @entity292 : we all knew @entity292 would be a success when he went to @entity25 but nobody expected the startling impact he made in his first game in september 2004			0
he scored a hat - trick at @entity84 in the 6 - 2 @entity123 victory against @entity300 ( below )			2
3 @entity301 : i remember the day @entity301 introduced himself to @entity304 football in august 1996			0
i made the bench for the first time at the @entity308 , it was a glorious day and a superb 3 - 3 draw			2
i ’ll never forget the celebration — pulling his shirt over his head — after each of his three @entity316 goals			0
4 @entity318 : there was a big buzz around the opening day in august 1994 and much of it was because @entity318 had joined @entity323			2
he did n’t disappoint at @entity324 , scoring a header , celebrating with a dive ( below ) to mock his critics and inspiring a 4 - 3 win at @entity329			2
5 @entity330 : @entity331 could n’t wait to get a glimpse of @entity330 after he arrived at @entity333 for a @entity335 record £ 2.2million from @entity336 in august 1988			0
that month he made a brilliant first impression , scoring three goals in a 4 - 0 win over @entity340 ( below ) .			2

@entity7 should be well ahead of @entity1 when you compare *strikeforces*
@entity15 knows how to bring the best out of his players in the big games
he dominates the build - up and gets in the heads of the opposition
city are by no means a title certainty as long as @entity15 is around
