by @entity0 skull pieces from an early human who lived 100,000 years ago in northern @entity3 suggest that inbreeding might have been common among our ancestors , a new study claims			1
the remains found at @entity9 , in the @entity10 , have a now - rare congenital deformation usually only found in incestuously conceived offspring			1
it adds to a growing body of archaeological evidence that human ancestors regularly inbred at least until the end of the @entity19 era			1
incest : a view of the @entity9 site and internal and external view of the @entity24 skull piece with its position indicated on the drawing of a complete skull examination of the skull , known as @entity24 , revealed an unusual perforation through the top of the brain case - an enlarged parietal foramen ( @entity34 ) or ' hole in the skull '			0
the symptom is consistent with modern humans diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation in the homeobox genes @entity40 on chromosome 11 and @entity42 on chromosome 5			2
these specific genetic mutations interfere with bone formation and prevent the closure of small holes in the back of the prenatal braincase , a process that is normally completed within the first five months of fetal development			2
it occurs in about one out of every 25,000 modern human births and is associated with inbreeding			0
abnormality : examination of the skull , known as @entity24 , revealed an unusual perforation through the top of the brain case - an enlarged parietal foramen ( @entity34 ) or ' hole in the skull ' although this genetic abnormality is sometimes associated with cognitive deficits , the older adult age of @entity62 suggests that any such deficits in this individual were minor			2
traces of genetic abnormalities , such as @entity34 , are seen unusually often in the skulls of @entity71 humans , from early @entity72 to the end of the @entity19			1
study author @entity74 , professor of anthropology at @entity76 , said : ' the probability of finding one of these abnormalities in the small available sample of human fossils is very low , and the cumulative probability of finding so many is exceedingly small			0
' the presence of the @entity9 and other @entity71 human abnormalities therefore suggests unusual population dynamics , most likely from high levels of inbreeding and local population instability			0
' it therefore provides a background for understanding populational and cultural dynamics through much of human evolution , he added			0
genetic : the symptom is consistent with modern humans diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation in the homeobox genes @entity95 on chromosome 11 and @entity42 on chromosome 5 speaking to @entity102 , dr @entity74 said : ' these populations were probably relatively isolated , very small and , as a consequence , fairly inbred			1
' the apparently common occurrence of such genetic abnormalities ' reinforces the idea that during much of this period of human evolution , human populations were very small ' , he added			1
the findings of the study , co-authored by @entity114 and @entity115 of the @entity116 , @entity117 , were published yesterday in the open - access journal @entity119 .			0

remains were found in northern @entity3 *'s* @entity10
the discovery adds to growing evidence that early humans inbred often
that could be because populations were so small , *researcher* suggests
