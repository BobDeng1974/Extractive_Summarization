by @entity0 published : 19:36 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:10 est , 4 december 2013 @entity4 teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths , science and reading for the first time			2
tests on more than half a million pupils worldwide found those in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 have a much better command of the core subjects			1
children in @entity13 are three years ahead of their @entity4 counterparts by the age of 15 , according to the major international study published yesterday			1
falling behind : @entity4 teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths , science and reading for the first time despite a near doubling of the education budget between 1997 and 2010 under @entity26 – from £ 50billion a year to £ 89billion – the study showed @entity4 children are still lagging			1
education secretary @entity28 said the poor results showed radical reform was necessary in a ‘ stagnating ’ education system			1
overall , the @entity4 was ranked 26th out of 65 countries and major economic regions by the @entity34			2
in maths the @entity4 was 26th – although researchers said a truer position would be 31st – while in reading it was 23rd			2
a slump in science took @entity4 from 16th in 2009 to 21st place now			2
in 2006 , @entity4 children came 14th in science , 17th in reading and 24th in maths			1
the @entity34 bases its research on two hours of problem solving tests designed to assess how children use their knowledge and skills in real life			1
one in five @entity4 15 - year - olds had only the most basic level of numeracy			1
one in six struggled with basic literacy and one in seven had only a rudimentary understanding of science			2
in the @entity4 , £ 59,719 is spent on each child between the ages of six and 15 compared with the equivalent of only £ 29,852 in @entity13			1
could do better : around one in seven teenagers have no more than a basic understanding of science surprisingly the report found boys did better than girls in maths and science , with the gender gap in @entity4 schools wider than in most other countries			1
this suggests fewer girls will head into careers in technology , engineering and science			2
and in a snap shot of the culture of our schools 25 per cent of the @entity4 children who sat the @entity34 test had skipped lessons in the previous two weeks , compared with just 4 per cent in @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity13			1
@entity26 yesterday attempted to lay the blame on the @entity85 , with education spokesman @entity86 claiming its schools policy was ‘ failing to confront the international challenge we face ’			2
‘ this report exposes the failings of this government ’s schools policy : a policy that has sent unqualified teachers into the classroom and prevented effective collaboration between schools , ’ he said			0
coalition reforms since 2010 include the introduction of free schools , tougher exams , performance - related pay for teachers and recruiting more top graduates into classrooms			0
@entity106 , the @entity34 ’s deputy director for education and skills , said : ‘ you surely could not expect any reforms to take effect for 2012 when these reforms were just being implemented			0
’ @entity113 had by far the worst performance among the home nations			0
based on its test scores , it would have been 41st in maths , 39th in reading and 36th in science in the @entity34 tables			0
@entity123 has been in charge of education policy since devolution in 1998 , although pay , conditions and pensions are still handled by @entity130			0
one of the main differences is its commitment to community - led comprehensives			0
this means there are no free schools or academies , which are state - funded but free from council control – giving heads far more autonomy			0
some foundation schools are independent from local authorities but legislation was introduced to stop more schools following their lead			1
based on its @entity34 test results , @entity147 would have been 26th in maths , 23rd in reading and 18th in science			0
out of the home nations , @entity152 was top but still way below the international best			0
it would have been 25th in maths and 21st for reading but behind @entity147 in science at 22nd			0
@entity113 is ahead of @entity147 in introducing a new curriculum			1
children aged between three and seven have been following a @entity160 - influenced agenda which favours ‘ experiential learning ’ over formal instruction			1
the reforms were brought in five years ago , meaning they will not have fed through to the teenagers taking the @entity34 tests			1
the @entity152 education system has a tradition of greater breadth of learning , with a wide range of subjects at secondary level than is seen in @entity147 schools			1
mr @entity28 said : ‘ these poor results show the last government failed to secure the improvements in school standards our young people desperately need			1
‘ @entity26 poured billions of pounds into schools and ratcheted up exam grades – yet our education system stagnated and we fell behind other nations			2
’ @entity184 of the @entity185 said : ‘ unfortunately , thanks to historic complacency , the @entity4 appears to have its feet shackled at the starting line			0
’ @entity4 spending on education is around 20 per cent higher than the @entity34 average but the report found no obvious benefit			2
‘ these comparative advantages do not have a clear relationship with educational outcomes , ’ it said			0
another @entity34 report , published in october , found the @entity4 was the only wealthy country where teenagers and young adults were worse at maths and reading than their grandparents , despite years of rising exam grades			1
and a study from the @entity206 , a @entity207 - based think - tank , found education here lags behind poorer countries such as @entity211 and @entity212			2
the @entity34 ’s @entity214 survey , ( @entity214 ) , was based on 510,000 students			0
in the @entity4 , 12,638 15 - year - olds sat the two - hour problem - solving tests in 477 secondary schools in 2012			1
@entity221 countries such as @entity222 , @entity82 and @entity223 reinforced their reputation as educational powerhouses			0
@entity13 came top in every subject for the second time in a row			1
@entity228 , the @entity230 ’s chief policy director , said @entity4 schools had been treading water and the report was a ‘ wake - up call ’			0
but experts claimed that even wide - ranging reforms would not close the gap with the leading nations because the @entity4 lacks their work ethic			0
@entity240 , professor of education at @entity241 , said : ‘ while high - level teaching skills are essential for maximising student performance , at a national level these can not have any impact without a culture of hard work , a drive to succeed educationally , backed up by strong support outside school			0
‘ although , of course , many would say this kind of culture could be unhealthy			0
’ the @entity255 teaching union said that @entity214 provided only a snapshot and should not be used to ‘ denigrate the hard work , commitment and capability of teachers ’ .			0

tests found pupils in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 better at core subjects
@entity13 children are three years ahead of @entity267 by the age of 15
