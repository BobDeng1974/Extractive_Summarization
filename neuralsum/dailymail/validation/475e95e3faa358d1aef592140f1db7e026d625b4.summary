@entity0 are the biggest @entity1 club when measured solely by the number of major trophies won , all - time			1
with 18 league titles , seven @entity5 , eight @entity6 , five @entity8 cups and three @entity9 , they have lifted 41 major honours in their history , two more than their closest rivals in this regard , @entity15 , who have 39			1
@entity15 have more league titles , 20 , and 13 of those have been won since @entity0 ’s last league title in 1989 - 90			1
they also have more @entity21 wins than @entity0 ( 11 ) , but fewer @entity6 ( four ) , fewer @entity22 ( three ) and fewer other @entity8 trophies ( one , the @entity24 of 1990 - 91 )			1
the silverware has been totted up as part of a @entity28 study to explore which @entity1 clubs are the ‘ biggest ’ ; 59 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been considered , having played in @entity34 ’s top division for at least a season			1
@entity36 and @entity37 celebrate in 1990 with the last league trophy to head to @entity0 @entity39 hoists @entity40 aloft after that famous night in @entity41 crowds we ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull			2
then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates			0
their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs			0
global fanbase we added up the total number of fans and followers for each club on @entity64 and @entity65 — by far the most popular global social media platforms			0
every club has official accounts			0
trophies we counted ‘ major ’ trophies won by each club , giving points for each ; 10pts for each @entity81 / @entity81 win , 8pts for each top - division @entity1 title , 5pts for each @entity21 or other @entity8 trophy win , and 3pts for each @entity78 win			1
no ‘ one - off ’ trophies such as the @entity83 are considered because they are not the product of multi-match competitions			0
and being a losing finalist does not count for points either — here at @entity28 , winning is everything , second is nowhere			2
average league finish the average league finish position for each of the clubs since 1888 - 89			2
player quality we counted the number of players from each club who have played for @entity34 , all - time , ranking the clubs by total			2
this reflects historic ‘ bigness ’			0
we then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the @entity107 — a measure of modern ‘ bigness ’			0
the overall ranking is an aggregate of these two			0
income we ranked the clubs by their income for the most recent season available			0
the biggest clubs have generally had the most money and been able to buy and pay the best players			0
the trophies considered as ‘ major ’ are those earned through playing a whole season , tournament or competition , so no ‘ one - off match ’ silverware has been included , such as the @entity83 or @entity125 , nor have we counted silverware won in events that have ever been ‘ one - off match ’ occasions - like the @entity128 , which morphed into the @entity129			2
some trophies are bigger than others ; few would disagree a league title is more impressive than an @entity21 , or that a @entity81 is bigger than a @entity78			1
so we have weighted the trophies , awarding 10 points for each @entity81 , eight for each league title , five for an @entity21 or other @entity8 trophy and three for each @entity78 win			1
in fact when the clubs are ranked 1 to 59 on total trophy wins without weighting , the order is very similar to the order when weightings have been applied			0
@entity0 stay at @entity147 for example ahead of @entity15 , themselves clear of @entity149 ( 28 trophies ) in third , @entity151 ( 20 ) in fourth and @entity152 ( also 20 ) in fifth			1
when clubs have the same number of trophies the total points are used to separate them			0
@entity151 and @entity152 have both won a @entity81 but @entity151 ’s seven league titles to @entity152 ’s four made the difference between that pair			1
when the points are the same , the club with the higher number of most important trophies are ranked higher			0
the full rankings of the ‘ biggest ’ clubs by trophies accompany this piece			0
of the 59 teams in our study , 46 of them have won at least one major trophy			2
the 12 that have n’t are ranked by how closely they have come , for example as runners - up in the @entity21 ( which is as close as @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 among others have come ) , runners - up in the @entity78 ( @entity184 ) and then by the highest position they ever achieved in the top division			0
after the top five trophy winners come @entity191 and @entity193 in sixth and seventh places , @entity191 ahead on points because their nine league titles , the last of them in 1986 - 87 , are far superior to @entity193 ’s two titles , the second and last in 1960 - 61			1
spurs are more cup specialists , having won eight @entity5 , four @entity6 and three cups in @entity199 , albeit not the @entity81			1
@entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 fill out the top 10 places , with rankings 10 to 20 dominated by former @entity206 teams , among them @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 among them , all of who have won the @entity1 title at least once and all of whom have won between four and 10 major trophies in their histories			1
@entity222 in 23rd place are the highest - ranked club never to have won the title , and are 23rd courtesy of their four @entity21 wins			1
they are a place above @entity228 , who have also never won the title and have won three @entity5			2
@entity232 and @entity233 beam after @entity149 won the @entity234 in 2002 @entity200 won their second @entity206 title in three years with victory in 201 @entity237 holds the @entity238 after @entity191 's 1987 title victory @entity152 claimed the first trophy of @entity242 's second stint with the club earlier this month			2

with 18 league titles , seven @entity5 , eight @entity6 , five @entity8 cups and three @entity9 , @entity0 have lifted 41 major honours
@entity15 have more league titles , 20 , and 13 of those have been won since @entity0 ’s last league title in 1989 - 90
