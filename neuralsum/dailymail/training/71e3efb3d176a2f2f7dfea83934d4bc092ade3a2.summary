by @entity0 a major row has broken out over the credibility of a groundbreaking experiment to detect what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the @entity10			1
the experiment was hailed as a look at the very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation			2
however , some researchers have now questioned the results			2
scroll down to see the moment the stunned @entity22 scientist is told his theory is correct gravitational waves from inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background , which is the afterglow of the afterglow of the @entity10 scientists , from left , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity36 - @entity35 and @entity38 smile during a news conference at the @entity40 in @entity41 to announce their groundbreaking results on gravitational waves scientists view the the universe as being made up of a ' fabric of space - time '			1
this corresponds to @entity50 's @entity49 which was published 1916			2
objects in the universe bend this fabric , and more massive objects bend it more			0
gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric			1
they can be produced for instance , when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies			0
gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the @entity10			1
online rumours earlier this week claimed that the scientists who reported the find have now admitted to making a mistake			1
the team missed a key detail in its analysis of galactic dust , the rumours say , making it more likely that the signal came from a source other than gravitational waves			1
physicist @entity76 of the @entity77 of @entity78 , @entity79 , on monday reported that ' experts now put a finger on what exactly went wrong in @entity83 ' in a controversial post			0
' among this understandable excitement , we have been aware that the signal has to be confirmed by other experiments before the discovery is established , ' he wrote			1
however , the team behind the experiment has hit back			0
' we 've done no such thing , ' principal investigator @entity38 at @entity93 told @entity94			0
' we tried to do a careful job in the paper of addressing what public information there was , and also being upfront about the uncertainties			0
' we are quite comfortable with the approach we have taken			0
' however , confirmation of the experiment wo n't be known until another group either supports or opposes their finding , which could happen later this year			0
according to @entity50 when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space - time known as ' gravitational waves '			1
the very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave background radiation - the afterglow of the @entity10 - as they pass through space			1
the theory suggests that this intial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble			0
earlier this year experts hailed the experiment as a massive step forward - but admitted the theory needed more work			0
' it 's just unbelievable quite honestly , ' professor @entity132 , who helped build the instrument that detected the waves , told @entity135			1
' this is confirming what is , to me , a wacky idea			0
' the next step is quite clear ; to confirm the data with another technology			0
' this graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the @entity10 to now			1
@entity146 scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth the finding by the @entity154 telescope ( pictured ) in the @entity155 could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years researchers at the @entity159 for astrophysics in @entity161 built super-sensitive radiation detectors and installed them in the @entity154 radio telescope at the @entity155 to find these ' ripples in the sand			1
' nine years later they found these swirling patterns in cosmic background radiation created by the gravitational waves caused by the very beginnings of the universe			1
many scientists already believed that an initial , extremely rapid growth spurt happened , but finding this evidence has been a key goal in the study of the universe			2
the results have been described as ' spectacular ' , and are expected to result in a @entity179 for the scientists the discovery gives us a window on the universe at the very beginning when it was far less than one - trillionth of a second old			2
the work still has to be reviewed by other scientists , but there is already talk of a @entity179			2
' it 's what 's i would term @entity179 winning physics , ' continued professor @entity132			0
' just who that prize goes to , however , will be up for debate			0
' @entity199 , or @entity199 for short , is a faint glow of light that fills the universe			1
pictured is the microwave radiation from the whole sky , captured by the @entity207 's @entity206 satellite according to @entity50 when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space - time known as ' gravitational waves ' a telescope at the south pole , called @entity154 ( @entity216 of cosmic @entity217 ) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves			1
the instrument , which scans the sky from the @entity155 , examines what is called the cosmic microwave background , the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe			2
the background radiation is not precisely uniform			0
like light , the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space			2
computer models predicted a particular curl pattern in the background radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe 's inflation after the big bang			2
it did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation			2
this is radiation that was created in the @entity10 and originally discovered in 1964			1
@entity154 measured the large - scale polarisation of this microwave radiation			1
only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern , and only if they have been amplified by inflation			1
‘ it 's just amazing , ’ added theoretical physicist @entity251 of @entity253 , who was not involved in the work			0
‘ you can see back to the beginning of time			0
’ another outside expert , physicist @entity259 of the @entity260 , said the finding already suggests that some ideas about the rapid expansion of the universe can be ruled out			0
right after the @entity10 , the universe was a hot soup of particles			1
it took about 380,000 years to cool enough that the particles could form atoms , then stars and galaxies			0
billions of years later , planets formed from gas and dust that were orbiting stars			0
the universe has continued to spread out			0
professor @entity251 said he thinks the new finding could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years , such as the @entity179 - winning discovery that the universe 's expansion is accelerating			0
the new results were announced by a collaboration that includes researchers from the @entity40 , the @entity286 , @entity22 , the @entity287 and @entity146 ’s @entity288			0
the team plans to submit its results to a scientific journal this week , said its leader , @entity38 of @entity40			0
this image shows temperature fluctuations , indicated by variations in colour , of the cosmic microwave background ( @entity199 )			2
researchers say since the @entity199 is a form of light , it exhibits all the properties of light , including polarisation ( shown by black lines )			2
the changes in polarisation are thought to be caused by gravitational waves the 14 - billion - year - long history of our universe			1
it shows the main events that occurred between the initial phase of the cosmos -- where its properties were almost uniform and punctuated only by tiny fluctuations - to the cosmic structure that we see today , ranging from stars and planets to galaxies and galaxy clusters a telescope at the south pole , called @entity154 ( @entity216 of cosmic @entity217 ) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves			1
@entity154 is shown here in the foreground with the @entity330 in the background for their research , astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the @entity155 , chosen for its very dry air , to aid in the observations			1
they were looking for a specific pattern in light waves within the faint microwave glow left over from the @entity10			1
the pattern has long been considered evidence of the rapid growth spurt , known as inflation			2
professor @entity38 called it ‘ the smoking gun signature of inflation			0
’ the scientists said the light - wave pattern was caused by gravitational waves , which are ripples in the interweaving of space and time that sprawls through the universe			1
the @entity154 telescope 's focal plane uses novel technology , developed at @entity146 's @entity288 , to build an array of devices that use superconductivity to gather , filter , detect , and amplify polarised radiation from the cosmic microwave background			1
each pixel is made from a printed antenna sensitive to polarised millimeter - wave radiation a full - sky map of the oldest light in the universe			2
colors indicate ' warmer ' ( red ) and ' cooler ' ( blue ) spots			0
@entity146 has called this image the best baby picture of the @entity372 ever taken if confirmed , the new work would be the first detection of such waves from the birth of the universe , which have been called the first tremors of the @entity10			1
@entity253 's @entity251 cautioned that it 's possible that the light - wave pattern is not a sign of inflation , although he stressed it 's ' extremely likely ’ that it is			1
it 's ‘ our best hope ’ for a direct test of whether the rapid growth spurt happened , he added			0
professor @entity251 and other experts said the results must be verified by other observations - a standard caveat in science			0
@entity393 , a theoretical physicist at @entity394 who did n't participate in the work , called the detection of the light - wave pattern ‘ huge news ’ for the study of the cosmos			1
‘ it 's not every day you wake up and learn something completely new about the early universe , ’ he said .			0

using the @entity154 telescope , scientists looked at specific patterns in light waves within the faint microwave glow left from the @entity10
they found pattern which they believe was caused by gravitational waves
new claims say signal came from another source
