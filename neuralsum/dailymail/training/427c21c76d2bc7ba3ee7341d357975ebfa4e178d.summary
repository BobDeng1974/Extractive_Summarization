a dad accused of killing his 10 - week - old baby has claimed that his miniature dachshund tripped him , causing him to fall on the child			1
the murder trial of @entity5 , 41 , began in @entity6 , @entity7 on tuesday , 20 months after the death of his baby son , @entity9 , at their home in @entity12 in january 2013			1
@entity5 has claimed he was holding @entity9 in one arm and letting his dog in through a glass door , when the pet ran between his legs , tripping him and causing him to drop the baby on the carpet and then fall on top of him , @entity13 reported			1
but in court , jurors heard how , during a three - hour interview with cops , @entity5 eventually said that he had squeezed the crying baby twice before hitting his head against a bed multiple times			1
@entity5 insists he tripped on his dog and fell on the child ' proud ' : a picture shared in court shows @entity5 with his baby son , @entity9 , before the boy 's death police and fire officials were dispatched to the home around 4pm on january 4 , 2013 and found the baby not breathing			1
detective @entity45 previously told the court that , after hours of interviewing @entity5 , the father admitted he had ' lost it ' and squeezed the boy			1
he then took his son into the living room to make it appear as if the incident had happened there			0
@entity54 attended the child 's autopsy , where the doctor showed him previous and more - recent broken ribs , a lacerated liver , skull fracture , and bleeding on the brain			0
heartbroken : @entity62 , the baby 's mother and @entity5 's former girlfriend , appears in court on wednesday			1
@entity5 said he falsely confessed to killing the boy so that he could get home to her testimony : paramedic @entity70 points to where he saw and felt damage to baby @entity9 's head discovery : @entity70 points to where he saw the baby inside the @entity6 home			1
@entity5 told detectives in an interview that he had squeezed the baby and thrown him against a bed before taking him to the living room on wednesday , the jury members were to hear a recording of the apparent confession , which @entity5 's defense team insists he only made after little sleep and much heartbreak			1
claims : @entity5 told cops and fire officials that he had tripped on his miniature dachshund , pictured in court , the @entity12 fire chief , a police officer , a police sergeant and a paramedic all testified that @entity5 told them the same story about tripping and falling on the boy			2
the only difference between the stories was that , while he told most he dropped the boy and then fell on him , the fire chief remembers @entity5 saying the two fell together			2
they also testified that bruises on the boy 's chin and body appeared to be semi-healed , suggesting that they were not newly inflicted			0
prosecutor @entity109 has said he believes @entity5 should be found guilty of first - degree murder , which comes with a mandatory life sentence			2
to secure this , prosecutors must show the dad intended to kill the boy or showed ' willful and wanton disregard ' for the fact that he could harm or kill the baby			0
@entity109 said he will prove that the boy had received multiple injuries , saying : ' this was no accident			0
' @entity5 faces an open murder charge , however , meaning he could still face second - degree murder or a manslaughter charge			2
loss : @entity9 was found unresponsive in his parents ' home on january 4 , 2013 and an autopsy later revealed he had broken ribs , a lacerated liver , skull fracture , and bleeding on the brain but the defense team , led by @entity134 public defender @entity133 insisted that the dog story was true and that @entity5 , who has some learning difficulties , told detectives he 'd shaken the baby so that he could return home to his fiancee			1
@entity133 added that no family members had spotted signs of abuse on the little boy			0
' what happened here is n't murder , ' @entity133 said			0
' this man idolized this child			0
... it was a tragic accident			0
' the trial has long been delayed due to legal wrangling			0
most recently , prosecutors were granted permission to play @entity5 's videotaped statement to cops .			2
