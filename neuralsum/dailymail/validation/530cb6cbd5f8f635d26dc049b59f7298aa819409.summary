we have been here before , of course — a breathless @entity3 win over @entity4 secured by the brilliant right foot of @entity6			1
that was last april and we all know what happened next			0
this time , the @entity3 charge is locked on a different target			2
last season , despite their slaying of @entity4 at @entity13 , they could not secure the @entity16 title and it remains to be seen if this tilt at the top four ends more happily			1
if it does , this will be looked upon as a pivotal day			0
@entity6 lets fly from range to score the winning goal for @entity3 as they continued their rich vein of form @entity6 , along with the @entity4 defence , watch on as the @entity26 's shot arrows towards the @entity4 net @entity28 is left helpless as @entity6 's effort rises above his outstretched hand and nestles in the back of the keeper 's net @entity6 leads the celebrations as @entity36 and @entity37 chase after him after his stunning winning strike @entity6 is lost among a heap of his @entity3 team - mates as the @entity13 side celebrate the @entity26 's winner against @entity4 @entity3 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity43 6.5 , can 7 , @entity36 7 , @entity44 6.5 , @entity45 6.5 ( @entity46 76 ) , @entity47 8.5 , @entity37 8.5 , @entity48 6.5 ( @entity49 82 ) , @entity6 9.5 , @entity50 7.5 , @entity51 8 subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57			1

no doubt feeling thursday night ’s @entity100 exit in their minds and legs , @entity59 ’ team faced a fresher @entity4 side hungry to close the gap on @entity105 at the top			1
still , though , @entity3 won , still they managed to take another step towards hauling in @entity108 and @entity109 in the places above them			2
this really was a remarkable effort , perhaps one of the most significant of @entity59 ’ reign			0
for @entity4 , questions remain			1
manager @entity79 still can not find a way to secure the centre of the field in games such as this			0
@entity124 pundits @entity122 and @entity125 described @entity4 ’s lack of control in that area as ‘ embarrassing ’			2
that may be overstating it but @entity4 continue to be undone the same way in too many big games			1
last season they got away with it but this time round they may not			0
having said that , it took a heck of a goal to win this			0
@entity6 was the game ’s star player			2
rarely has @entity61 on the @entity4 right had such an uncomfortable time			2
the goal , though , was something else			0
a right - foot shot from the angle of the box , it was so perfect in angle and trajectory that @entity28 , though he had plenty of time to see it , had absolutely no chance of stopping it			2
it came out of nothing			0
the game had fallen into a fallow period with 15 minutes to go			1
@entity79 had sent on an extra midfield player in an attempt to close the game down and a contest that had been open for an hour had become scratchy			0
perhaps @entity6 sensed the mood			2
that is what the best players do			0
perhaps he knew that if he did n’t take the occasion by the lapels and shake two extra points from it , nobody else would			0
he had been a pest earlier , too			0
@entity4 had started the brighter of the sides and could have taken the lead when @entity49 chipped a cute ball over the top for @entity61 to volley over			1
@entity47 continues to impress in the @entity3 midfield and he curled home the opening goal against @entity4 @entity47 's shot flies towards @entity4 goalkeeper @entity28 who attempts to position himself to make the save @entity28 attempts to fling his right hand across his body to stop the shot but must realise @entity47 's effort will evade his grasp @entity47 is mobbed by his @entity3 team - mates and @entity13 boss @entity59 after his effort beat @entity28 all ends up ten minutes in , though , @entity3 suddenly clicked and @entity6 was at the heart of it			1
first he played @entity51 through a gaping hole between @entity62 and @entity63 , only for the midfielder to shoot weakly at @entity28			0
then , moments later , @entity51 lashed the ball into the net from an angle , only to be ruled offside			0
pressure was mounting and it was n’t long before @entity3 were ahead			2
@entity67 sold @entity195 short with a pass in midfield and when the @entity198 could not catch @entity6 , the ball was funnelled forwards to @entity47			1
the @entity201 man moved the ball out of his feet and curled it past @entity28 with his right instep from 20 yards			1
it was a lovely goal and the celebrations by the @entity3 bench said everything for its importance			2
for a while , @entity3 were at their waspish best and , as a result , @entity4 rocked			1
@entity3 were not in front for long as @entity71 finished off a delightful team passing move to bring parity to the @entity13 clash @entity71 celebrates his strike with his team - mates who played an instrumental part in the build up to @entity4 's equaliser @entity70 fires in a shot under pressure from @entity3 midfielder @entity51 as both sides looked to edge in front @entity227 did race through to strike a post but at the other end @entity48 wasted one chance and @entity50 — once again playing as a centre forward — ran on to a @entity6 pass to mug toure and slide a cross-shot wide			1
at 1 - 0 , @entity3 were in the ascendancy			1
@entity4 , though , looked dangerous when they moved forwards and after @entity6 had erred for once by presenting a clearance to @entity61 in the 26th minute , the visitors moved through the gears , enabling @entity71 to run on to @entity70 ’s neat through pass and beat @entity43 with his right foot			1
for a while , this was a contest that crackled with energy and attacking threat			0
@entity6 was @entity3 ’s go - to man throughout while , for @entity4 , @entity69 was equally dangerous			1
the @entity248 enjoyed himself at @entity13 last season and was prominent once again here			0
@entity51 screwed a chance wide late in the first half following @entity45 ’s lovely chip , while @entity70 and @entity50 missed opportunities at the start of the second period that they perhaps should have taken			0
beyond @entity6 ’s goal , @entity4 did raise themselves a little			1
@entity69 slashed a chance wide after a buccaneering @entity49 run while @entity70 did likewise			0
at the @entity261 , meanwhile , @entity46 ran clear but could not convert			0
at full - time , it felt a significant result			0
but , to repeat , we have been here before			0
@entity3 boss @entity59 ca n't hide his joy at the final whistle as @entity3 edged out @entity4 to ignite their top - four hopes as @entity59 celebrates @entity3 's victory , @entity4 boss @entity79 ( right ) looks dejected as his side 's title hopes take a hit @entity28 , beaten by two cracking strikes , looks dejected ( left ) and is consoled by his @entity201 team - mate and @entity3 midfielder @entity47 @entity51 fires a shot across @entity28 but the in - form midfielder ca n't find the target from a narrow angle @entity55 and @entity46 warm up on the sidelines as they watched their side take on @entity4 @entity55 looks less than happy as he sits among the @entity3 substitutes during his side 's victory at @entity13 @entity49 and his brother @entity287 played against each other for the first time when the latter came on for @entity3 in the second half			1

@entity47 curled home a @entity295 opener from 20 yards to put @entity3 in front
@entity71 finished off a well - worked team move 15 minutes later to haul the @entity16 champions level
@entity6 scored the winner for the home side in the second half to continue their fine run of league form
@entity4 remain five points behind leaders @entity105 at the top of the league as their title *challenge* *stalled*
