@entity0 asked @entity3 blog @entity1 about the dilemma facing @entity5 as he mulls over who to appoint as his captain to replace the departed @entity8			1
shortly after the exit of @entity8 came the arrival of new manager @entity5			1
the @entity12 ’s departure sparked a debate over who will become club captain , but the @entity16 is adamant that he will not rush the awaited decision			2
@entity18 speaks regularly on how important deciding a captain is for his side			2
he looks for players with similar outlooks to himself on life and , of course , football philosophy			2
while leading @entity27 to a @entity29 semi-final , he named @entity31 captain , which reveals the pre-existing trust within their working relationship , thereby making the striker a prominent front - runner for the @entity3 job			1
video scroll dwon to watch @entity5 closely supervising @entity3 training decision time : @entity5 will name his @entity3 captain before the start of the season ' for me , it [ is ] always very important , the choice of the captain , because he is the captain on the pitch , and he can enlarge my influence , ' @entity18 told @entity48			1
' he more or less needs to have the same philosophy and the way of seeing life			0
that [ person ] is not so simple to choose , so i need time to do that			2
' this summer alone , @entity3 have lost four players that have previously served as captain : @entity8 , @entity56 , @entity57 , and @entity58			1
each one ’s leadership was significant in the dressing room , and will be missed			0
at the least , @entity58 is still present as assistant manager			1
in the current squad , @entity63 has most frequently worn the captain ’s armband , but , being unfamiliar to @entity18 , is not a definite shout for the role			1
at the moment , four players are in contention for captaincy			2
they are as follows , in no particular order : farewell : @entity8 applauds the @entity74 crowd for the final time after @entity3 beat @entity76 in may @entity31 @entity77 played six matches ( 548 minutes in total ) at the @entity29 , scoring four goals			1
yet , @entity18 was not afraid to substitute his main man up top when they were in search of a goal			0
@entity85 was the usual replacement , and the @entity88 man rewarded his boss with a key goal and an assist in three energetic appearances			0
the argument against making @entity77 captain would be his well - publicised clashes with @entity96 , last season			1
@entity98 may have borne out many of his opinions , but issues within the club should stay there , rather that be aired out in the press			0
the new manager ’s previous relationship with the player , however , makes any repeat episodes highly unlikely			0
it was no secret that @entity77 struggled to get on with @entity111 and was tempted on more than one occasion to leave the club			0
sir @entity114 had promised to be there the for three seasons of @entity77 's contract but now when he looks at it , things could not have worked out better			0
@entity121 delight : @entity18 and @entity77 celebrate after the @entity27 captain 's wonder goal vs @entity124 @entity63 having deputised for others on several occasions , serving as the de facto captain would be a role that @entity63 would relish			1
approached with the proper attitude the responsibility could carry him to the next level in his development as a player , building confidence within him , and transforming what has become a tarnished image without			0
earning the new manager ’s trust , and leading @entity3 back into the @entity142 title race would also bolster his credentials for the recently - vacated @entity145 captaincy			1
@entity63 's previous contract maneuverings , with rumours that he was pushing for a move to @entity150 in 2010 , and @entity151 last summer , are the same type of dissension in which @entity77 engaged with @entity96			1
there are also the troubles with his fitness and accusations regarding an off - season regimen erring on the side of light			2
@entity18 surely knows about these issues , and will wish to see nothing less than a full commitment to training , and to the club , before he is willing to trust the face of @entity3 with its future			1
such a commitment , however , will have supporters looking eagerly towards his ascension up the venerated club 's all - time goal - scoring list , on which his 216 trail only @entity175 's 237 and sir @entity174 's 249			1
it is said that @entity96 had intended to hand the captaincy to @entity63 this season , with @entity8 's retirement to @entity182 completed , but , at this point , the @entity3 universe is past caring the least what @entity96 ' plans were			1
for his own betterment , @entity63 should be , as well			1
he 's behind you : @entity18 keeps a close eye on @entity63 during training in @entity191 last month @entity192 the @entity194 centre half has endured a couple of rough patches at @entity3 since he broke into the first team			1
@entity192 was often offered up as the sacrificial lamb after poor results , regardless of the self - evidence of his ability and potential			2
it has become all too familiar for @entity3 to have a wrongly acclaimed scapegoat down the years			1
like @entity205 , @entity192 has been successful in terms of proving many doubters wrong , but to this day others remain none the wiser			0
in fact , of the club ’s current defenders , he is arguably the best			0
both @entity212 and @entity213 have some work to do			0
in regards to captaincy , @entity192 is a personal favourite for the role			1
the 26 - year - old already has already displayed leadership			2
many will argue that he remains a work in progress , but if the time is not now , do not be surprised if it arrives soon			2
following loan spells at @entity226 and @entity76 , the centre back returned to @entity74 with vast improvements and it was only a matter of time before sir @entity114 made use of that			2
@entity18 has an eye for talent , and surely will , as well			0
@entity233 : the centre back has been something of an unsung hero over the last few years @entity237 what a u-turn @entity237 has made with his football career			0
a year or so ago , everyone , including sir @entity114 , doubted whether he would play again after a difficult battle with an intestinal disease			0
the @entity243 has slowly but surely returned , but uncertainty over the permanence of his recovery , and his match fitness , place him on the perimeter of the squad			0
he seems a newcomer rather than an old veteran			0
i suspect that @entity254 ’s captain with the @entity256 national team will have to do more than even @entity63 to earn the armband from @entity18			1
experienced : @entity237 , 30 , made his @entity3 debut in the 2002 - 03 season @entity205 ( n / a ) unfortunately , @entity205 ’s serious ankle injury , suffered prior to the pre-season tour , has put him on the shelf for three months			1
it goes without saying that the knock completely rules him out of the this race for captaincy			2
in terms of leadership , @entity205 let himself down last season			0
he was one of the players expected to pull his weight when @entity3 ’s backs were against the wall			1
saying that , it was a season the club need to write off , and , had he not been injured , @entity205 would have deserved the same clean slate now being given to @entity77			0
the quicker @entity3 get @entity205 back into the fold the better			1
maybe not as captain , mind			0
out of the running : @entity205 ( centre ) will miss a large chunk of the season with an ankle injury @entity5 has come into the job late , but with no preconceptions , and no sense of urgency			1
every player in the squad is being given the opportunity to impress			0
the @entity16 will continue to observe his squad for the remainder of this @entity296 tour , searching for the perfect blend of youth , talent , athleticism , experience , and leadership			0
he is more patient with the process than @entity3 supporters who have just endured the worst season in living memory			2
when he is ready , he will name his squad , and captain			0
until then , all the rest of us can do is guess .			0

@entity3 captaincy vacant after @entity8 left to join @entity313
regular stand - ins @entity57 , @entity56 and @entity58 also gone
@entity5 has said he will take his time before making appointment
@entity31 the favourite , with @entity63 also in the running
