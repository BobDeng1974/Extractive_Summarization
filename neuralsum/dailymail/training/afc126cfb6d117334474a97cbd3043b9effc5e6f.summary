by @entity0 published : 04:59 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 05:42 est , 19 march 2012 @entity2 radio presenter @entity1 has revealed he was targeted by an abusive internet troll for nearly two years after he replaced @entity4 on @entity5			1
the anonymous online abuse was directed not only at him , but also his wife and baby son and became so hateful , he was forced to report the suspect to the police			1
the 36 - year - old has spoken out in a documentary about cyber bullying due to be shown tonight , despite fearing this will provide further ammunition for internet trolls			1
concern : @entity2 radio presenter @entity1 has revealed he was targeted by an abusive internet troll for nearly two years the rise of internet trolls - the name for people who offend and bait others on the web - has significantly risen with the development of social networks which people feel give them a place to insult other internet users without real - life repercussions			1
@entity1 said the abuse began when he replaced @entity4 on the radio show and the man voiced his dislike of the new programme on @entity36			1
but then it started to take on a more sinister tone when the troll started to mention the former @entity42 presenter 's wife @entity40 and the couple 's five - month - old son @entity43			1
in a @entity2 article @entity1 explained ' this fella was fantasising about my death , daydreaming about me dying in a plane crash , and expressing his hope that my body would be mangled in a car wreck			1
' personal attack : the online comments started to take on a more sinister tone when the troll started to mention the presenter 's wife @entity40 and the couple 's five - month - old son @entity43 ' not content with just repeating how much he hated me on a daily , sometimes hourly , basis , he started posting links full of abuse to my wife , mother and work colleagues			1
' in the @entity2 3 documentary , @entity67 , @entity1 tried to track down his abuser and also met bereaved relatives left distraught after they were preyed on by ' @entity71 ' posting offensive messages on tribute sites			2
the suspect is a man in his forties and during the three months the documentary was being made , the man posted 255 abusive tweets			0
@entity1 originally wanted to try to meet the troll who was targeting him , but had been advised to take it to the police			1
' i wanted to know how a dislike of a radio station could go to contacting my family and tweeting about my baby , ' he said			1
' but the advice i got from a psychologist and a police officer was to make an official complaint , so i 'm in the process right now of making a complaint to the police			0
' in an article for the @entity97 on sunday , the radio presenter described how the internet abuse spread			1
' a few years ago , he began a blog called ‘ @entity1 is a * * * * ’			0
he then went on @entity36 and , using as his wallpaper a photograph of me when i had been assaulted a few years ago , he began tweeting abuse to me , my family and work colleagues			1
' as a broadcaster , a bit of abuse comes with the territory , and in no way am i comparing what i was exposed to with the shocking levels of abuse directed at the grieving families i met			2
' but when the abuse started to escalate , i felt he had crossed a line , ' he wrote in the newspaper			2
his partner @entity40 tried to reason with the troll on @entity36 , but the abuse escalated and it experts were called in to help piece together the identity of the suspected troll using clues from his online activity			1
hate campaign : he said the abuse began when he replaced @entity4 on the radio show and the man voiced his dislike of @entity1 's programme on @entity36 during the programme @entity1 met families who had been targeted by trolls , in cases he said were far more distressing than what he had been through			1
' what i have been through is n't that bad really , it 's been distressing for my family but personally as a broadcaster it 's something i know how to deal with			0
' what 's really heartbreaking is the parents and families of people who have killed themselves			0
' he met the parents of @entity141 , 15 , from @entity142 , @entity143 , who apparently killed himself after being bullied online			2
a tribute site for him was hit by trolls , leaving vulgar messages that were seen by his family and friends			0
' they see these nice tributes then they also see these weird sexual , violent comment and imagery , ' he said			0
' for people who do n't even understand @entity159 in the first place , as well as being upsetting and prolonging their grief , it 's confusing			0
' during the documentary , he also met a self - appointed ' troll hunter ' , who tries to track the people down and expose them			1
' what he does is he works out who they are then posts letters to their neighbours saying , ' do you know your neighbour is doing this ? ' in the documentary @entity1 tracked down @entity175 , who was jailed for posting obscene messages on sites in memory of dead people , including @entity180 star @entity180 and tribute site to @entity182 , a @entity183 boy mauled to death by a dog he said the ' troll hunter ' told him perpetrators had started hacking other people 's accounts and sending offensive messages from their identities , which could lead to retaliation			2
' imagine if you 're the brother of the person who has killed themselves and you see the name and picture of a person you think is doing it , some people might react with violence			0
' the troll thing is in an abstract world , but increasingly what they do is crossing over into the real world			2
' in the documentary @entity1 also tracks down @entity175 , who was jailed for 18 weeks in october 2010 for posting obscene messages on @entity159 sites in memory of dead people , including @entity180 star @entity180 and tribute site to @entity182 , a @entity183 boy mauled to death by a dog			0
@entity1 said he hoped to alert people to the growing problem and how to stop it : ' i met two in the show , they are quite intelligent , meek and mild people and some have quite respectable jobs			2
' their power and the thrills they get all come from their anonymity			0
' he said he thought some trolls saw themselves as ' brave ' , and making dangerous ' jokes ' , but added : ' but what they are doing is targeting individuals			0
' they know their fellow trolls are watching			0
you can abuse someone in front of an audience and that 's why in the end all it is is bullying			2
' some of these trolls will themselves be deserving of sympathy but that does n't mean we should n't tackle them			0
' it 's time to stand up to them , it 's time to either expose them or if you 're a victim go to the police			0
' the @entity67 airs tonight at 9pm on @entity253 .			0

@entity5 presenter said *criticism* of his radio show turned into abuse involving his mother and wife , as well as his five - month old son
the former @entity42 said the online troll ' fantasised about me dying in a plane crash and being mangled in a car wreck '
