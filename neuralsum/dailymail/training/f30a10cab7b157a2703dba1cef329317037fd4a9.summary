according to a recently released study , the average @entity1 household has access to nearly 200 cable television channels - and most of those households only actually watch fewer than 20 of them			1
on tuesday , @entity8 released its @entity10 and @entity11 report , which found that the average @entity1 home had access to 189 cable channels in 2013 - a big jump 2008 , when the average household had about 129 channels			1
according to @entity8 's study , the average @entity1 only watches about 17 of the 189 television channels that they pay for , which has technology analysts concluding that cable customers are getting much less value for their money than they have in the past			2
cable bill : the average @entity1 pays for 172 cable television channels that they do n't actually watch ' cable companies keep adding more channels to watch and keep increasing the price we pay month after month , yet we still only watch the same channels , ' technology consultant @entity29 tells @entity35			1
' we pay roughly double this year compared to what we paid ten years ago			0
' the national average bill for cable customers is about $ 90 per month - which has nearly doubled since 2003			2
by 2020 , experts estimate that the average cable bill will be more in the neighborhood of $ 200 per month			2
the study concludes that more content - or television channels - does n't result in increased channel consumption			0
the numbers should be a sign to advertisers and content creators that quality is crucial because consumers have so many options in terms of what type of programming they view			0
streaming : many @entity1 have ditched cable altogether and are replacing it with less expensive video streaming services like @entity58 ' this data is significant in that it substantiates the notion that more content does not necessarily equate to more channel consumption , ' @entity8 explains in its report			1
' and that means quality is imperative -- for both content creators and advertisers			0
so the best way to reach consumers in a world with myriad options is to be the best option			0
' this is a crucial time for cable providers , as many former customers have opted to ' cut the cord ' and ditch cable tv altogether rather than pay for more than 100 channels they do n't watch - many media consumers are now using video streaming services like @entity58 and @entity82 rather than rely on the cable company			1
currently , a subscription to @entity58 costs $ 7.99 per month .			0
