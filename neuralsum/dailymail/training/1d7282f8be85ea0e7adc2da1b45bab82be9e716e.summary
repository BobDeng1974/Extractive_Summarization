she proved a match for @entity2 when she broke @entity4 ’s codes at @entity5 , so lord king of @entity7 should have known better than to comment on the advancing years of @entity8 of @entity9			1
the formidable 89 - year - old conservative life peer was unimpressed when her relatively junior colleague gestured towards her to illustrate his point about the extreme age of @entity15 veterans			1
@entity16 hit back against his patronising reference with a distinctly unparliamentary gesture of her own - commonly known as the two - finger salute and reminiscent of @entity20 's famed @entity22 ' sign			1
@entity16 appeared to be minding her own business peering down at some papers over her spectacles as the former defence secretary paid tribute to veterans of the @entity44 who had ‘ gradually faded away ’			2
then turning towards @entity16 , @entity6 , 78 , raised his arm towards her and continued : ‘ and then the survivors of @entity15 started to look pretty old as well			2
as my noble friend , the @entity8 , reminds me			1
' at this point , @entity16 glared at him with disdain , raised two fingers at him to signal ‘ up yours ’ , and then went back to studying her notes			1
the exchange instantly became an internet hit with viewers describing the former chain - smoking lady @entity57 – known by colleagues as ‘ @entity60 ’ - as a ‘ heroine ’			1
extraordinary : the clash between the two peers took place on thursday when @entity6 was making a speech in a @entity36 debate in the @entity37 @entity16 , formerly @entity8 , yesterday claimed that the gesture was not intentional and insisted her hand must have ‘ flown up ’ accidentally			1
she told the @entity70 : ‘ i did n’t mean to make the gesture			1
my hand must have flown up			2
i have never been offended by @entity6			0
i do n’t remember doing it			0
’ born in 1922 , @entity16 was also a former mayor of @entity72			0
between 1989 to 1992 , she was a minister of state at the @entity73 – which , at the age of 69 , made her the oldest woman minister ever			1
codebreaker : the @entity8 helped to crack @entity4 's codes at @entity5 during the 1940s in 2005 , she was made a @entity80			1
as a @entity8 she was a member of the @entity81			1
a former 70 - a - day smoker , @entity16 is well - liked by colleagues for her wicked sense of humour and straight - talking			0
during a debate on equality , @entity16 sent peers into gales of laughter by revealed that booking into a hotel used to give a ‘ certain frisson ’ as her late husband had to use a different name			0
when she was a guest on @entity95 , she chose the crown jewels as her luxury item , in order to maximise her chances of being rescued			0
lord @entity6 last night insisted that the pair were ‘ old friends ’ and that @entity16 had been joking with him when she made the gesture			1
he said : ‘ we had been joking together before we went into the chamber			0
‘ she is a wonderful person and was the only person in the chamber who had been in the second @entity15 and was taking part in the debate			0
‘ she made some sort of gesture			1
i think it must have been my reference to her age			2
but there is absolutely no ill feeling between us at all			0
she is a very old friend of mine			0
‘ she went on to make a wonderful contribution to the debate and was on very good form			0
it is rather frightening that this is now all over the internet			2
i hope nobody thinks i was offending her			0
’ well - liked : the @entity8 is popular among her peers for her wicked sense of humour and straight - talking lord @entity6 served in the @entity127 from 1983 until 1992 and was appointed @entity128 under prime minister @entity129 during the @entity130			1
he left the @entity127 after the 1992 general election , and returned to the backbenches where he served as chairman of the @entity134 from 1994 - 2001			0
he was made a life peer in 2001			0
one comment on the website @entity138 said : ‘ my headmaster 's wife way back in the 60s , and a formidable battleaxe back then			2
she 's a fine woman who has had an illustrious career in the @entity37 for many many years			0
’ another added : ‘ surely it was a reference to @entity20 ’s victory gesture ? ’			2

@entity8 was hitting back at comments about her age
