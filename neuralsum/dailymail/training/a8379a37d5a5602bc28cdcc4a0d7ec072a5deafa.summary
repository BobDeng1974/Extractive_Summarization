most tourists visiting the capital will call in at @entity2 and visit @entity3 , but very few will venture beyond to some of the secret - but equally beautiful - sights in @entity8			0
however , one photographer has dedicated four years of his life to tracking down some of the most unusual and overlooked attractions in the city , taking beautiful photos to celebrate their history			1
from corridors of power to shrines of religion and music , photographer @entity15 has caught them all on camera for a book entitled ' @entity23 '			1
following vandalism after it became defunct in the 1950s , but volunteers have helped restore its beautiful @entity33 heritage designed by sir @entity35 and @entity36 , the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , was first used in 1867 when it was the @entity41 building @entity43 ’ @entity42 , built between 1927 and 1932 in @entity44 , is the headquarters of the @entity46 of @entity47 and the principal meeting place for @entity49 in @entity8 , and right , the @entity50 in the @entity52 building at 71 @entity53 , the highlight of @entity56 's architectural genius the @entity57 has an elaborate match of tradition and modern fare			2
the building is fully open to the public and free tours are available most week days londoner @entity15 , 66,compiled his labour of love after first being inspired by a view from his own apartment across the @entity68 from @entity69			1
he said : ' i 'm a @entity15 myself and my apartment between the @entity72 and @entity73 overlooked the @entity69			1
' over the years i saw it 's transformation and when i was first allowed in there to photograph it was incredible			1
' it was the change of this building that inspired me to think what other great parts of @entity8 nobody had seen or knew about			2
' the city is constantly evolving and some of these buildings will be lost without someone ever seeing them			0
@entity87 ' @entity86 in @entity88 has an extensive range of classic and modern outboard equipment ; any operator of this would certainly have to know what they are doing however @entity87 were made famous by @entity94 , who recorded an album of the same name , which of course , featured the group walking over the pedestrian crossing outside the venue @entity86 is the largest purpose - built recording studio and can comfortably house a 110 - piece orchestra ' now @entity69 is set to hold three hotels , 3,990 apartments , 250 shops and restaurants with a studio going for £ 950,000			0
' in his stunning pictures some unlikely locations prove themselves real hidden gems - like the incredible interior of the 1859 @entity26 , in @entity25			1
@entity15 said : ' the irony is that this pumping station was designed as part of the sewer works created by sir @entity29 to take the waste out of @entity8			1
but his ancestor went on to produce tv 's @entity120 , in my opinion bringing it back in			2
@entity87 has become a favourite tourist attraction , with fans keen to leave their own personal mark there , and right , the @entity124 imposes from near and far this motor provides the power for the @entity124 's revolving floor , that has once housed a restaurant			2
nowadays the venue is reserved for specially - organised trips @entity137 @entity136 used coal to power two pumping engines that pumped water from a reservoir under the floor into the hydraulic system that helped open @entity144 up for ships to pass while @entity144 is recognisable from the front , if you were shown this photo you might not know you were in the bascule chamber underneath one of @entity8 's famous landmarks ' the interior of @entity154 was interesting , it goes back to a time when people respected their bank manager			1
it includes bespoke furniture including a cupboard for the management 's top hats and a drawer below for their canes			0
' and people do n't realise @entity166 which i photographed is big enough to hold a symphony orchestra , for film scores , and they still record in analogue			0
' the @entity124 is open to access and what fascinated me was the tiny lawnmower sized engine responsible for revolving the top floor of the @entity124			0
@entity176 's @entity175 on @entity177 , @entity178 , was built in 1879 by the @entity175 community in @entity8			0
it is built in the form of a cruciform basilica with a central dome @entity69 is a decommissioned coal - fired power station located on the south bank of the @entity68			1
the development of flats and houses could see the area become more like a village in a city ' a lot of the buildings in the book you can get in to see but it 's not easy and you can perhaps only have five minutes in them			1
' for example i 've walked past the @entity201 's building in @entity202 thousands of times and had no idea of the hidden gem inside			2
' ' @entity8 was a four year journey of discovery starting with @entity69			0
many photographs in this book will be the last record of a disappearing world			0
' to order a copy of the book visit : @entity214 and click on ' @entity23 '			1
@entity215 provides a high class of boarding education for children in @entity8			0
there is some evidence of a school being on the site as far back as 1243 , but the one we know today is believed to have dated back to 1572 @entity223 and @entity224 are some of the most famous alumni of @entity215 ; more recent old scholars include actor @entity227 and and current @entity47 rugby international @entity229 the squash courts at @entity215 , where the yearly fees are almost £ 36,000 for education and boarding the @entity154 board room is found close to the @entity235 and @entity236 in the @entity237			0
the building was built between 1924 - 1939 and @entity239 designed the exterior elevations plus the ground floor banking hall , basement safe deposit area , directors ' and boardroom floors plus staircases and certain other areas			0
