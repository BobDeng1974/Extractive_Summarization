the capture of the @entity22 crossing on @entity9 's de facto border in the @entity13 - the only official crossing between @entity9 and @entity2 - held more symbolic value than strategic , but rebels said it would provide relief to nearby villages that were under siege by government troops			1
rebel fighters captured the @entity9 side of the sole crossing over the armistice line on wednesday morning in a deadly battle with government troops			1
stray mortar fire into the @entity13 left an @entity2 officer moderately wounded , with the army saying that it immediately launched a counter-attack			1
' in response to the errant fire from the internal fighting in @entity9 , which hit @entity2 earlier today and injured an @entity61 ( @entity61 ) officer , the @entity61 just targeted two @entity9 army positions in the @entity67			1
hits were confirmed , ' it said in a statement			0
this afternoon , lieutenant colonel @entity70 told @entity71 : ' from what we know , opposition forces overran the @entity9 regime forces on the @entity9 side of the @entity22 crossing , some of those including the @entity5 , which ultimately leave the crossing in the opposition forces ' hands			1
' the capture of the @entity22 crossing on @entity9 's de facto border in the @entity13 - the only official crossing between @entity9 and @entity2 - held more symbolic value than strategic for the rebel the fighting at the crossing with the @entity2 - occupied @entity13 began on wednesday morning smoke rises at the @entity9 - @entity2 border after the heavy clashes @entity2 tourists peer down at the scene of the conflict , which left 24 dead ' we have declared a closed military zone in the immediate area of the crossing and the roads leading to it			1
we are prepared for any potential spillover effect into @entity2 , ' he said			2
' the opposition forces including the @entity5 have been on the border area for some time now , but this is not necessarily an increased threat ( to @entity2 ) , ' these forces have said multiple times that when they are done with @entity9 , they will head to @entity2			1
their hands are tied up in @entity9 at the moment , so we have to be prepared for that development			0
' earlier the army said it had responded by hitting two @entity9 army posts			0
as a result of the fighting on the @entity9 - controlled side of the plateau , the level of alert was raised on the @entity2 side , a spokeswoman said , without confirming that it had been increased to the highest level			1
on sunday , at least five rockets hit the @entity2 - occupied side of the plateau , all of which were due to stray fire , the army said			1
in june , an @entity2 teenager was killed in a deliberate cross-border attack , which prompted @entity2 warplanes to attack @entity9 military headquarters and positions			1

since the @entity9 conflict erupted in 2011 , the plateau has been tense , with a growing number of rockets and mortar rounds hitting the @entity2 side , mostly stray , prompting occasional armed responses			1

@entity222 's comments , delivered in a prime - time address on national television , appeared aimed at countering critics of the war , with both hard - liners in his governing coalition and residents of rocket - scarred southern @entity2 saying the war was a failure because it did not halt @entity207 's rocket attacks or oust the group from power			1
