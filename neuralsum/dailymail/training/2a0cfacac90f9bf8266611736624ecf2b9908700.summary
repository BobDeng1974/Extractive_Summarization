by @entity0 for @entity1 when it came to their granddaughter 's 21st birthday one pair of grandparents were n't content with gifting a key in the door			0
@entity9 and @entity10 made their granddaughter 's dreams come true when they paid for her to get the boob job she had always wanted			0
@entity14 , 22 , from @entity15 had always suffered from low body confidence due to her @entity18 bust			1
so when it came to deciding on a 21st birthday present , breast implants were the obvious choice for @entity14			2
however , when the air stewardess approached her mother with her request , @entity31 said that operation - costing £ 5000 - was out of the question			1
desperate to get the breasts to match her size 8 figure , @entity14 turned to her grandparents			1
@entity14 says she had always felt really self - conscious wearing a bikini with her 34a breasts @entity14 has now gone up four cup sizes to a @entity41 and she says she has never felt more confident her doting relatives were hesitant at first but when @entity14 said that if they could n't help she would take out a commercial loan @entity10 and @entity9 finally relented and agreed to lend her the cash			1
once she was given the go ahead , @entity14 wasted no time and days later had booked an appointment with a private surgeon and decided on a double d pair to take the place of her natural boobs			2
the stewardess was no stranger to surgery having had her teeth corrected when she was just a teenager			2
' when i was 17 i had veneers for my teeth and they made me so much more confident and willing to smile i figured that it would be a similar story with my boobs			0
' since her operation @entity14 has felt confident enough to try her hand at beauty pageants despite it being a life long dream to have bigger breasts , @entity14 admits that she was nervous about the operation			1
' i had a wobble the week before my surgery but when they came to draw on me i figured it was too late now and i was sure it was the right decision			0
' since having the procedure the 22 - year - old feels so confident that she has turned to beauty pageants to flaunt her new figure and has spent the last year strutting the catwalk			1
' i 'm loving getting in to the pageant circuit - i would never have had the confidence before i had the surgery ' says @entity14			1
doting grandparents : when @entity14 ( centre ) first approached them @entity9 and @entity10 were hesitant to loan her the money , but when their granddaughter said she would turn to a commercial loan they gave in ' the best bit is that it 's not all about looking nice and pretty dresses - it 's about inspiring younger girls and raising thousands for charity			1
' @entity14 says that since her operation she has been able to where whatever she wants without feeling self conscious about her small chest			2
' i 've always been flat - chested and all my friends are really skinny with massive boobs and i would actually hide and refuse to sunbathe next to them			0
' now i never worry about putting on a bikini or a nice dress to go out because my boobs are ample enough to fill them			0
and it 's all thanks to my grandma and granddad			0
' @entity14 thought about keeping her procedure a secret but has decided her implants are something to be proud of although her grandparents originally paid for the procedure @entity14 is helping to cover the cost by repaying them slowly			1
' borrowing the money from my grandparents was definitely worth it - even though i 'm paying it back bit by bit every month			0
' @entity14 attempted to keep her breast implants quiet but has since decided that they are something to be proud of			2
' i thought about keeping my fake boobs a secret , but when a friend told everyone in my hometown i did n't really have a choice			0
' and then i thought : " why should i be ashamed ? " i have a career , i did n't take money from the @entity133 to get them , and i 'm much happier			0

@entity14 had always suffered from body confidence issues
she hated being pictured in a bikini because of her 34a cup size
@entity14 turned to her grandparents to fund the £ *5,000* surgery
the air stewardess has now gone up to a cup size @entity41
she is now so confident that she has began *competing* in pageants
