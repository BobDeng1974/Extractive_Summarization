by @entity0 published : 20:10 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 21:25 est , 23 january 2013 a drunken brawl with his equerry			1
a married mistress , secret hotel assignations , an illegitimate child — surely our brand - new hero @entity7 is n’t up to his old tricks again already ? thankfully not			1
but details emerged this week of another @entity7 — the @entity12 ’s uncle , not her grandson — which shed light on the pressures of life as a royal soldier and which demonstrate that , in the @entity19 , change does not come quickly			1
extraordinarily , it ’s the sale of a small pair of gilt cufflinks which have brought to light just how our prince @entity7 has , by comparison with his namesake , comported himself with rather more decorum than we might previously have given him credit for			1
flying prince : the @entity32 prince @entity32 got into a fight with his loyal equerry after being told to choose a wife against his wishes after all , we have n’t heard of him sharing the bed of a married woman with his elder brother			1
or creating a love - nest outside the back door of @entity44			1
or splashing out the equivalent of £ 1 million to pay for a love - child			1
prince @entity7 , @entity32 , third son of @entity47 , did all of that and more , and got away with it			1
yet it has taken an auction in a @entity54 saleroom for the comparisons to come out			2
lot number 1384 in @entity57 and @entity59 ’s sale today is a handsome pair of monogrammed cufflinks — the sort of desirable trinket royalty used to hand out to friends and devoted courtiers			2
the cufflinks owe their presence in the saleroom thanks to their connection to a hitherto undisclosed punch - up between the prince and his equerry at @entity71 in @entity72 in the summer of 1934			1
in front of their appalled host , the @entity73 , the two men , dressed in white tie and tails , waded into each other and had to be pulled apart by a beefy aide - de - camp			2
drink , inevitably , had been taken			0
the mists of time , alas , conceal the exact words exchanged between the two old friends			0
but the demands of trying to be both a royal prince and a soldier — the very thing young prince @entity7 was trying to explain about his own life this week — had a lot to do with it			1
like his young relation , old @entity7 was an ambitious officer in a cavalry regiment , trying to make his way in a profession which respected royalty but also put it to the test			0
then , as now , the conflict of royal duty versus commitment to his brothers - in - arms made for hard choices			1
at 34 , old @entity7 ’s greatest wish was to command his regiment			0
but public duties kept getting in the way , and in the summer of 1934 he was in @entity106 undertaking a diary of engagements which would make modern - day royals blanch			2
namesake : prince @entity7 , pictured at @entity111 , @entity112 , shares his love of the @entity114 with his great uncle the @entity32 there had been five days of pressing the flesh , listening to boring speeches , rebuffing the attentions of @entity121 matrons			1
in addition , @entity7 had learned that a three - month tour of @entity124 handed to brother @entity125 was being passed over to him — because @entity125 was ‘ exhausted ’ from a tour of @entity127			2
it meant his chances of promotion within the 10th hussars were pushed back by at least a year			0
at @entity71 the anger and frustration finally boiled over : the prince and his devoted equerry , a @entity133 - educated @entity132 called @entity138 , came to blows and had to be pulled apart			1
the root of it all was @entity7 ’s infatuation with a married woman , mrs @entity143			1
some years earlier he ’d travelled to @entity144 with his eldest brother , the @entity7 — later @entity146 — on a safari which morphed into a babes ’ n ’ booze-fest that would put the present - day @entity151 larks in the shade			2
the royal brothers shared the bed ( thankfully on different evenings ) of @entity157 , daughter of a @entity159 racehorse trainer and unusually a woman who ’d made a name for herself as a pilot			1
striking rather than beautiful , she had a voracious appetite for men			0
but while the @entity7 had the sense to move on , @entity7 could not : he made her his long - time mistress			2
though her life was centred on @entity144 , he paid for a permanent suite at the @entity170 , a five - minute walk from the back gates of @entity44 , so that he could simply move in with her			2
some time later , it emerged that she was pregnant			2
‘ people naturally assumed , with the @entity32 always in and out of her suite , even going to the nursing home the day the child was born , that it was his , ’ wrote her friend @entity175			1
@entity143 , of course , had a husband — and his family were incandescent that she ’d blackened the family name by giving birth to a royal bastard			1
@entity187 , pictured at the @entity188 , @entity189 , with a young prince @entity32 , had to shell out the equivalent of £ 1million on a child rumoured to have been fathered by the @entity32 there was an angry showdown at the @entity44 between @entity143 ’s husband and @entity7 ’s mother @entity187 after the head of @entity143 ’s family — baronet sir @entity192 — threatened to reveal the contents of letters sent by the prince			1
‘ old @entity187 opened her purse - strings , ’ observed a family friend , and a sum equivalent to £ 1 million today was settled on @entity205 for the upbringing of her son			1
she was paid the interest until her death in 1986 , never once revealing that the child had not been fathered by @entity7 , a fact the scheming mrs @entity143 knew all along			1
but @entity7 was reckless , and rather proud of himself for having — so he thought — fathered a son			2
@entity187 , however , was outraged			0
she soon sent her son a short - list of @entity217 princesses and ordered him to take his pick			1
on top of that , @entity7 had just been informed his brother @entity221 was ‘ too tired ’ to go to @entity222			0
‘ this hit him twice over , ’ wrote an old friend			0
‘ @entity7 was being asked to be a substitute for his effete brother when all he wanted to do was get back to soldiering			0
he had high hopes of commanding the regiment , and did n’t want to jeopardise that by spending months away from home			0
and @entity143 was due back in @entity231 and he was aching to see her			1
’ thus , with @entity7 in militant mood , @entity138 probably went too far that day at @entity71 in 1934 when he suggested life would be so much easier if the prince just got himself a wife — and that there was an ideal girl to hand			2
she was the daughter of a @entity239 grandee , the @entity240			0
maybe @entity241 was , at 34 , a little long in the tooth but the @entity243 were the biggest landowners in @entity217 and , in @entity246 country , held more sway than the @entity248			0
@entity7 did n’t like the idea			0
he ’d met the girl			0
he ’d met her sisters , too , all four of them , and there was n’t anything to choose between them			0
he was in no hurry to cast off his bachelor status — he saw himself as a bit of a ladies ’ man			0
was n’t the mother of his son , @entity143 , about to fly back to @entity261 from @entity144 and take up residence in their old suite at the @entity170 ? maybe this was the moment when @entity138 told old @entity7 to wake up and smell the coffee			1
and as a consequence his master took a swing at him			0
despite his infatuation with mrs @entity143 , who also shared the bed of his elder brother @entity146 , prince @entity32 married princess @entity274 in 1935 , pictured and the confrontation seems to have spurred @entity7 to face up to his responsibilities			1
on his return from the hated @entity222 tour months later in 1935 , @entity7 went to stay with his friend @entity279 at @entity280 in the @entity281			0
there , by design , was @entity284			0
‘ that was when we became engaged , ’ she recalled , rather glumly			0
‘ there was no formal declaration on his part			0
i think he just muttered it as an aside during one of our walks			0
he certainly did n’t shower me with flowers because that was not his way			0
’ not like he ’d showered @entity143 with champagne and jewels , that ’s for sure			1
@entity7 had been cornered — by circumstance , by his overbearing parents , by the whole ruddy royal apparatus			2
the marriage was a success — it lasted 38 years until his death in 1974 — but it might be concluded that @entity7 cared less about life after that			0
could it be that in his dotage , he still looked back on that bout of fisticuffs as a turning - point ? certainly , he regarded the clash with @entity138 as regrettable , for the aide - de - camp who pulled them apart was sent the cufflinks as a mark of gratitude			2
then , as an afterthought , he was also made a commander of the @entity323 , a considerable honour			0
@entity7 got a gong as well			0
he was made a @entity326 , the @entity328 equivalent of the @entity329 , for those few hectic days in @entity121			0
it sat prettily on his heavily - bemedalled chest , for the @entity32 in his dotage took consolation in a glass of wine and wearing impressive uniforms			1
let us hope that on his return from @entity112 , @entity337 might look at his great - great - uncle ’s adventures , and draw valuable lessons about the responsibilities that come with being a prince of the realm .			1

details have emerged this week of a punch - up between royal soldier @entity32 , the @entity12 *'s* uncle , and his loyal equerry over a married woman
prince @entity32 was infatuated by mrs @entity143 , who was rumoured to have given birth to his son
