according to its website , these minimum security prison camps , have dormitory housing , a relatively low staff - to - inmate ratio , and limited or no perimeter fencing			2
they are usually work - and - program oriented and inmates help serve the labor needs of the larger institution or base			2
former @entity47 officer @entity46 , former @entity49 assemblyman @entity48 and one time underworld mafia boss @entity50 , 96 , are currently inmates there			2
the medical center inmates are often allowed to leave the facility to see outside specialists and for tests and medical procedures not available in the medical center			1
the @entity59 is focused on preventing rehabilitation by encouraging inmates to participate in a range of programs that have been proven to reduce repeat offending			0
the level of security which @entity4 will be held under depends on his changing circumstances - because he is a pretrial inmate - and he has no set protocol at this time			1
@entity4 will have access to medical and dental care , and the prison 's handbook states that inmates have the right to a healthy , nutritious diet , as well as information about staying healthy while behind bars			1
he spoke to police from his hospital bed			2
whether suspected terrorists should be read their @entity86 rights has become a controversial issue in the @entity88 reflecting on the scenes of destruction at @entity92 , vice president @entity89 condemned the bombing suspects as ' two twisted , perverted , cowardly , knockoff jihadis ' yesterday @entity4 admitted to his role in the attacks to the @entity97 - but clammed up when finally read his @entity86 rights			1

it has been revealed that @entity4 , initially confessed to authorities that he and his older brother , @entity171 , 26 , carried out the attacks during 16 - hours of questioning over the weekend			1
@entity4 has been communicating with law enforcement officials by writing on a pad after suffering an injury to his throat during the frenzied manhunt for him which renders him unable to talk			1
however , the moment he was read his rights on monday - which as a citizen of the @entity88 entitle him to the constitutional right to remain silent and seek a lawyer - he stopped communicating			1
indeed , it has been claimed that federal agents were surprised when a magistrate judge and a representative from the @entity88 attorney 's office entered the hospital room and read @entity4 his rights , four officials and one law enforcement official said			1
investigators had planned to keep questioning him			0
this apparent confusion came after the @entity194 decided against treating @entity4 as an enemy combatant			1

@entity4 is recovering in a hospital from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt last friday			1
police had previously said @entity4 exchanged gunfire with them for more than an hour last friday before they captured him inside a boat in a suburban @entity14 neighbourhood			1
a piece of remote control equipment has been found amongst the debris at the scene of the bombing			1
experts say it would have been triggered just blocks away from the site of the bomb confused reports about the shootout in a @entity14 backyard have emerged			2
officials now claim that @entity4 was unarmed as he hid in boat in @entity249			1
this contradicts @entity14 police commissioner 's account of hour - long firefight with @entity4 but yesterday , two unnamed officials said that he was unarmed when captured , raising questions about the gunfire and how he was injured			2
the report contradicts the @entity14 police department 's own account of @entity261 's capture - after commissioner @entity262 describes a firefight between him and officers before the terror suspect was captured			0
more than 4,000 mourners at the @entity267 paid tribute to a campus police officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing suspects			0
