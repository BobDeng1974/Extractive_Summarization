@entity0 chairman @entity13 said : ' @entity4 is a key signing for us and will bring both quality and depth to our half - back options and combinations			1
@entity4 will join @entity0 from @entity3 in a three - year deal from next year ' he is a proven and experienced stand - off and will also bring directness and toughness as well as a strong kicking game			1
' @entity4 began his career at @entity26 and also played for @entity27 and the @entity11 before moving to @entity7 with @entity3 in 2013			1
he was forced to sit out the first month of last season due to a suspension carried over from the @entity30 for a high tackle , but went on to make 49 appearances in his two seasons at the @entity34 , scoring eight tries , 84 goals and two drop goals , and also played for the @entity38 against @entity39 in the summer of 2013			0
@entity4 said : ' i want to thank the club , particularly @entity42 and @entity43 , for the opportunity to come to @entity3 ' i was staring down the barrel of a long suspension in the @entity30 and they gave me the chance to come to a great club and made me and my family feel so welcome whilst we 've been here			2
' leaving the club will be sad but it 's a decision i had to make in the best interests of my family			0
we only get a small space of time in rugby league to do the best we can and the opportunity at @entity59 was in the best interests of both parties			0
' i am really excited to be joining @entity59			0
it will be great linking with my friend and former team - mate @entity10 and what is an exciting and strong squad			1
' @entity3 will now step up the search for a replacement for @entity4 , as well as @entity70 - bound hooker @entity69 , with chief executive @entity43 currently in @entity2 on a scouting mission			2
chairman @entity42 said : ' @entity4 leaves with our best wishes			2
we sat down with him to discuss his plans for next season and beyond but whilst we were willing to open negotiations about a contract extension around @entity79 time next year , we were n't prepared to commit to a new deal before then			0
' we understood his desire for stability with a second child on the way and we gave him permission to speak to other clubs			0
saints made us an offer that was too good to turn down and we decided to accept it			0
' we are now on the hunt for a new half - back and the fees received for both @entity4 and @entity69 will be reinvested into the squad and will allow us to spend to the full salary cap next season			2
