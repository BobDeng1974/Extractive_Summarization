captured by award - winning photographer @entity12 , the picture shows the @entity13 ’ youngest child gripping her father ’s neck while she snuggles against her mother			2
it is striking that the three - year - old features so prominently because @entity2 has closely guarded his children ’s privacy since moving to @entity8 and usually requests that all photographs of them are pixelated			1
greeting : prime minister @entity2 and his wife @entity24 photographed with daughter @entity25 at 10 @entity27 for their 2013 @entity7 card it is the second time @entity25 has taken centre stage on the @entity2 ’s card , after appearing in 2010 just months after her birth			1
more than 2,000 cards have been printed for the prime minister to send in the coming weeks			1
however , he will not sign them all personally and many will be pre-printed with his signature			0
mr @entity2 has opted for a photograph of himself and wife @entity24 each year since taking power in 2010 , when they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby @entity25 on the steps of @entity8			2
@entity47 also appeared on the prime minister 's card in 2010 in 2011 it was a photograph taken during a street party to mark the @entity52 , and last year they were seen welcoming the @entity55 flame to @entity27 on the eve of the @entity57			1
this year ’s card rounds off a year when young @entity25 has often made the news			1
mr @entity2 has spoken of his desire to take her to nursery in @entity62 as often as possible and is often pictured leaving @entity8 carrying scooters , dolls and buggies			0
in july @entity25 was rushed to hospital after getting a sticker trapped up her nose			0
doctors at @entity71 ’ in @entity72 removed the sticker after her concerned parents ’ unsuccessful attempts to do so at their @entity27 flat			1
this week @entity78 revealed his official @entity7 card , an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who turned up too late to see @entity82			1
festive ? this painting of the fourth wise man @entity84 by @entity85 will grace the front of the first minister @entity78 's 2013 charity @entity7 card the @entity90 first minister has opted for the bleak , sinewy painting of @entity92 by @entity90 artist @entity85			2
the artwork will be sold to raise money for charity , but some questioned whether its choice for a @entity7 card was not very festive			2
since 2007 mr @entity78 has raised £ 148,000 for charities in @entity90 through sales of the original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card			1
today he unveiled the @entity104 painting , which will be sold at auction in the @entity106 with the proceeds shared between the @entity108 ( @entity109 ) , @entity110 , @entity111 ( @entity111 ) and @entity112 , the charity chosen by the artist			0
he insisted the image of @entity92 is a ‘ hugely appropriate ’ work for his card			2
mr @entity78 said : ‘ the legend of @entity92 , or the fourth wise man , is based on a novel by @entity119			0
it tells the tale of a @entity123 scholar who , delayed by helping the vulnerable , follows the star to @entity125 but arrives just too late to herald the birth of the @entity128 child			0
‘ thirty years on in @entity129 , at passover , @entity84 is still searching			0
‘ now an old man , he parts with the last of his three gifts to @entity82 , a sapphire , a ruby and a pearl , to save a young girl from slavery			0
however , in a dying vision , @entity84 is comforted that his devotion to the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven			0
