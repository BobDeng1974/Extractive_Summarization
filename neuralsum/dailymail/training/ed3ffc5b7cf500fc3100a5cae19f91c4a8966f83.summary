positioned as a place for passers - by to take a well - earned rest , the wrought - iron based bench lies under the @entity15 lift in @entity8 , @entity16			1
the bench at @entity15 lift in @entity8 , which has been dubbed the worst view in @entity19 @entity20 , 36 , who has lived in @entity8 all of his life , said : ' i have often wondered why it 's there , what a horrible place to put a bench			1
' it must be the worst view in @entity19			2
' i would never sit on the bench , all you can see is graffiti and a dark hollow , it 's the stuff of nightmares			0
' there are benches round the corner you can sit on with a much nicer view , and you 're not in a dingy , dark environment			0
' whoever decided to plonk it there needs a serious talking to			0
