the former chief of the @entity1 , professor @entity2 , has warned that @entity3 needs to prepare itself for a century - long war , both overseas and at home , against radical @entity8 militants			1
currently the director of the @entity10 at the @entity11 , professor @entity2 told @entity13 that as a liberal , secular society , @entity3 is perceived as ' the far enemy ' by radical @entity8 groups and individuals , and would no doubt continue to be targeted			1
' we are already affected in that there are places that would be wise for us not to travel to and there have been terrorist bombings in places that we do travel to , as we can see from 9/11 and both of the @entity26 bombings , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' but terrorists only have to be lucky once			0
' mr @entity2 told @entity39 that the war against radical @entity8 was likely to last for nearly 100 years			1
' @entity3 is involved in the early stages of a war which is likely to last for the rest of the century , ' he said			2
' we must be ready to protect ourselves and , where necessary , act pre-emptively to neutralise the evident threat			0
get ready for a long war			0
' he also noted the significant increase in brainwashing content online from radicals looking to recruit @entity3 to their cause and the effect this information has on national security			1
' one example is a radical online magazine called @entity58 , which encourages people to make attacks , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' one recent issue had a photo of the @entity63 on the front cover			0
' he continued : ' plots have been thwarted at the @entity68 army base for instance , and other iconic locations			2
' i do n't see big armies coming here , but i mean these people who have been radicalised , they â€™re getting ideas off the internet and these ideas are pouring into our lounge rooms			0
he said @entity3 needs to defend itself against individuals who are being brainwashed by radical information online , travel overseas to fight and then ' return home radicalized and decentralized and looking to continue the fight ' ' there are certain elements of jihad groups who see the @entity88 as a target , and there are people living in @entity3 who have these ideas and some have gone overseas to fight , who will return home radicalised and decentralised and looking to continue the fight			2
' his warnings come only a day after @entity99 chief @entity98 addressed the media to explain the necessity of the mandatory data retention plans that were recently approved by the @entity103			0
' the terrorist threat is suddenly starting to impact on @entity3 citizens and on the security of @entity3 citizens to a greater degree than it has in the past , ' mr @entity98 told media			2
on wednesday , mr @entity110 also revealed the government was increasing the authority of national counter-terror agencies as well as granting them $ 630 million in funding to assist in the fight against home - grown terrorism			1
the warnings come after @entity99 chief @entity98 argued the necessity of mandatory data retention and mr @entity110 revealed the $ 630 million in funding being granted to national counter-terror agencies mr @entity2 voiced his support for the new policies , saying the restriction of civil liberties was an unfortunate necessity for national security			1
he also suggested that @entity3 had to ' protect itself ' by ' making it difficult for certain individuals to come to @entity3			0
' ' i think the most import thing is to identify that the threat is not the individual terror group but the radical ideology that they 're following , ' mr @entity2 said			2
' we need to counter that			0
that 's a job for moderate @entity141 nations and leaders in @entity144 communities to say " these radical ideas are wrong and we should be following the rules of the nation we live in "			0
mr @entity2 said the conflicts derive from a century old ' battle of ideas ' of how we should live in society , with radical @entity8 societies believing that there should be no difference between politics and religion ' we also have to support the @entity144 community in @entity3 and the de-radicalisation of these ideas			1
' he suggested that @entity3 should follow in the footstep of the @entity162 and become involved internationally in the internal struggles , highlighting a key point made by mr @entity165 in a speech before launching an air - raid on @entity168			0
' as we look out from @entity3 , we can see chaos and unprecedented savagery in some of these lands , particularly in the @entity173 groups in @entity168 and @entity174 , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' how long can we sit back and watch this before we decide out of morality that we have to do something about this ? '			0

@entity2 claims @entity3 is one of many @entity181 countries perceived as ' the far enemy ' by radical @entity8 militants
he said terrorist plots have been thwarted for iconic @entity3 *landmarks*
his warning comes only a few days after the government *announced* its $ 630 million funding boost to national counter-terror agencies
