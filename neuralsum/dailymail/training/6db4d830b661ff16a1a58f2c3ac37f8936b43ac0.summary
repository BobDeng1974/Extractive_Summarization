a new @entity1 style app allows travellers to connect all over the globe , without having ever met in person			1
@entity5 allows tourists and backpackers to maximise the social side of their trips , by introducing them to people who will be in the same place , at the same time - before they even get there			1
' with @entity5 , planning a trip becomes more about ' who ' than it is about ' where ' and ' when ' , ceo and founder of @entity5 , @entity18 , told @entity19			0
no more fomo and much more social travelling			0
you 'll never hear about a friend that was in the same city of you and you had no idea , ever again			0
' first , users create a profile , entering in information about their itinerary , the name of the city they 'll be visiting or an attraction or event they 're heading for			1
then they enter their preferences about who they 'd like to meet up with , and can start anonymously swiping through potential travel buddies			1
if two users ' like ' each other - a connection is made , via @entity50			1
' we chose to use @entity50 for a few reasons , ' @entity18 said			0
' first , it makes the initial sign - up significantly quicker ; it also provides a degree of authentication that we would not be able to offer at this stage ; and we are able to show how people are connected via different degrees of separation			0
' users can anonymously swipe through potential travel buddies and make connection ' we are aiming to fundamentally change the way that people travel , ' says @entity18			1
' at the moment , who a traveller can meet is limited to where they stay , what they do and chance			2
this drastically reduces the number of people that a traveller can meet			2
' the app has drawn comparisons to dating app @entity1 , but @entity18 says there 's a lot more on offer with @entity5			1
' we have seen a lot of people that are using @entity1 to meet new people on their travels but have been put off by the more ' sexual ' nature of app. travellers can match with locals , which is great for local advice like places to stay or things to do on your trip ' the other problem that they experience is that they often get ' matched ' after they have already left			1
with @entity5 you can connect well in advance			0
' the other bonus of @entity5 is that you can match with locals , which is great for local advice like places to stay or things to do on your trip			0
people may well use @entity5 for travel dating but we want it to be so much more			2
we want people to connect with like minded travellers regardless of sex			2
' and what of the potential dangers of meeting up with strangers ? ' the advantage with @entity5 is that for 1st , 2nd and 3rd degree connections , the user can see how they are connected , ' says @entity18			2
' this offers a degree of safety because the user can then ask the mutual friend for a reference on any new potential travel friend			1
the anonymous nature of the swiping also means that if you ' x ' a user , they will not be able to contact you			2
you can only contact another tripr user if you both approve each other			0
' users enter information such as they will be travelling and preferences about who they 'd like to meet ' the argument for its safety can be put like this ; you could meet a stranger at a bar on your travels ( degree of risk ) or you could connect with them ( potentially months in advance ) on @entity5 and get to know them , get a reference from a mutual friend and make sure they are who they say they are , long before you actually meet them in person			1
' lastly , all our users login via @entity50 ands this provides an extra degree of user verification			0
' the app was initially aimed at students , but @entity18 hopes it will appeal to ' a new generation of backpacker ' and eventually to all travelers			0
@entity161 is available for @entity163 devices through @entity165 's app store .			0

new travel app allows backpackers to arrange to meet up all over the globe
users can do *preliminary* *research* on potential travel buddies
appeals to travellers put off more sexual nature of @entity1
