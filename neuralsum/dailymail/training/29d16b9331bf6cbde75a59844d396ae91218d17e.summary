@entity0 has likened @entity2 's first defeat as @entity4 manager to his own struggles at @entity6			1
@entity7 took over from the @entity8 in the summer after a terrible campaign with @entity0 at the helm - but the @entity12 's arrival could n't sort the @entity13 out straight away with @entity4 falling to a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity15			1
and @entity4 flop @entity0 says @entity7 is suffering the same problems he did during his year in charge - and has urged @entity4 bosses to stick with their man and to give him the time @entity0 did not enjoy			2
' every team in the @entity32 is very organised now and quite often it ’s the special players that win you the games			0
' @entity0 backed @entity7 to do what he could n't do by revamping the @entity4 squad from the sir @entity40 era			1
' everybody knew it was going to take time , ' he told @entity44			0
' taking over from sir @entity40 for anybody , it would take time			2
' @entity2 will need the time to do the job as well			0
he ’ll need to have that opportunity to change things and get a team he wants			0
' give us a wave : will @entity7 get the time at @entity6 that @entity0 says he needs ? lots to think over : @entity7 has a bigger job on his hands at @entity4 than it first seemed face palm : @entity61 managed four games last season but that experience could n't help @entity7			1
