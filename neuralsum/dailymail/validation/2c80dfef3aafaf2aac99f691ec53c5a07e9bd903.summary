a primary school headteacher has banned pupils from watching this friday 's solar eclipse on health and safety grounds			1
in a letter sent to parents , @entity6 claimed @entity10 school in @entity11 would not take ' risks around pupil safety and wellbeing ' during this friday 's rare cosmic event			1
parents have spoken out about the overzealous measures , suggesting the children should be given the chance to see the phenomenon - but the school says the protective glasses are not suitable for children under ten			1
@entity24 : new @entity10 school in @entity11 , above , will not allow children to watch the eclipse on friday in mr @entity6 's letter , he wrote : ' it is with disappointment that i need to advise you that we will no longer be purchasing the solar eclipse glasses and viewing the eclipse as a school			1
' this is after further careful consideration of the health and safety advice , alongside guidance from @entity11 's @entity42 colleagues			1
' clearly the school will never take any risks around pupil safety and wellbeing			1
i do hope you understand my decision			2
' staring directly at an eclipse carries the risk of permanent damage or even blindness unless specialist lenses or devices are used			2
although the moon is expected to block out 98 per cent of the sun 's light , even staring at the remainder of it for too long can cause irreparable damage to the eye			0
mr @entity6 referred to an online report which suggested the protective glasses may be too big to be worn securely by children , and that children under ten should only watch the eclipse on tv or with an indirect viewer			1
the partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on friday , march 20 , and will be visible for thousands of kilometres parents of the pupils at @entity74 in @entity11 said they were disappointed they would miss out on witnessing the phenomenon , which will not reoccur in @entity76 until 2026			1
one parent , @entity77 , said : ' it just seems like a little bit too much political correctness			0
' i understand that it 's for the kids ' safety , but if the glasses fit my kids correctly i 'd let them see it			1
' another father , @entity88 , added : ' it 's a shame			0
my daughter @entity90 was looking forward to seeing the eclipse , but the school has got to put safety first really			1
' @entity94 , @entity11 's director of education and children 's services , said : ' schools will decide individually on activities to watch the eclipse and will do so safely			1
' the last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 august 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029			2
an eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun 's diameter obscured by the moon			2
it is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration , which is a measure of the sun 's surface area covered by the moon			2
the value given is taken at the moment when the eclipse is at is maximum			2
the maximum of two minutes and 23 seconds of totality for the 1999 eclipse occurred close to @entity124 in @entity125			2
it was said to have been the first total eclipse visible in @entity128 since 22 july 1990 , and the first visible in the @entity76 since 29 june 1927			2
local councillor @entity129 added : ' some might say this is health and safety gone mad but i think the school is doing the right thing to protect the children 's eyesight			1
' new @entity10 is not the first school to make the ruling			1
@entity140 in @entity141 said it will not let children watch the natural display outside , even if they have bought special glasses with solar filters			1
instead , the primary school will show the eclipse on a live feed inside the school premises			1
the decision came following an email which was reportedly sent to the schools by @entity153			2
the memo advised schools to read a leaflet from the @entity157 on how to observe an eclipse safely			0
the partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on friday , march 20 , and will be visible for thousands of kilometres			0
it will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush - hour in the @entity76 , and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment			0
experts have warned that drivers may be dazzled as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter			0
the proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near - total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the @entity76 , so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in @entity183 , @entity181 will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			0
the most ' complete ' eclipse in the @entity76 will be see from @entity189 in the @entity190			0
@entity191 will vary , so that in @entity183 , the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will begin at 8.24am			0
the eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. by 10.41am , the moon will leave the sun 's edge and the partial eclipse will end			0
astronomer @entity205 from @entity206 do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse ? ' it 's all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening , but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes , binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight			0
' that 's not to say that you ca n't watch the eclipse on friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection			1
many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse - they can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers ' dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk			1
however , unless you already own one , know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy , they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds			0
' there are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse , though			0
' are solar glasses fine to use ? ' many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse			1
these can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers			0
' they work by employing a @entity248 film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun 's light , allowing you to view the eclipse safely			0
' before using them though , you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer			0
if you 're in doubt , do n't use your viewers at all			0
