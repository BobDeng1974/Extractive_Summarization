every year around 6,000 people go to @entity11 to be treated for cancer			1
unison regional head of health @entity192 said : ' the decision to take @entity11 into special measures is the right one			1
' the trust board has lost the confidence of patients and the public in north east @entity201 and people want to see strong , positive action to improve health care at the hospital			2
