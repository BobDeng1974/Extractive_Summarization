@entity2 wants to see the independent state of @entity4 wiped off the map , the country ’s interim prime minister claimed yesterday			1
as fresh clashes erupted in @entity9 and across the east of the country , pro-western @entity6 blamed @entity13 ’s secret services for dozens killed in a fire in the city on friday			1
‘ what happened in @entity9 was part of a plan by the @entity20 to destroy @entity4 and its statehood , ’ mr @entity6 alleged			1
‘ @entity22 sent people here to create chaos , ’ he added			0
further violence engulfed the country over the weekend			0
in the eastern city of @entity41 , @entity39 forces tricked soldiers into eating food laced with a sleeping potion before taking them hostage on saturday			0
some 2,000 pro-moscow activists stormed the @entity9 police @entity48 in the normally easygoing @entity51 resort , shouting ‘ fascists , fascists ’ and ‘ @entity22 wo n’t abandon its own ’ as they demanded the release of almost 130 ‘ comrades ’ arrested for bloody unrest in which 42 were killed			2
after forcing their way into the yard and smashing windows , the authorities caved in and released some 30 of the detainees			0
engulfed by violence which is rapidly plunging @entity4 into full - scale civil war , the bespectacled @entity6 begged his people to unite and to bury their differences ‘ so as not to give the terrorists backed by @entity13 the opportunity to divide our people ’			1
attack : pro-western @entity6 said @entity20 president @entity2 wants to ' destroy @entity4 and its statehood ' @entity22 had a very different take on it , with one senior figure demanding that @entity76 ’s leaders should be hauled before the @entity77 in the @entity78 over the @entity9 ‘ massacre ’ in which pro-russians were killed			1
senior mp @entity81 warned ‘ that @entity85 ’s fate is in store for @entity4 ’ , referring to the years of ethnically - fuelled bloodshed that scarred the @entity83			2
@entity6 countered by accusing @entity2 of a plan ‘ to repeat in @entity9 what is happening in the east of the country ’			1
he spoke in @entity9 , in @entity4 ’s south , which was founded by @entity20 empress @entity92 , and is seen by some as a key target for @entity22 in seeking to grab territory stretching from @entity98 eastern areas to the @entity100 enclave of @entity101 which will this week make a new bid to be subsumed into the @entity104 empire			1
but he was also critical of his police , firing all commanders on @entity9 for failing to protect people and failing to counter ‘ terrorist forces ’			2
‘ there were dozens of casualties resulting from a well prepared and organised action against people , against @entity4 and against @entity9 , ’ said @entity6 , whose government is being closely aided by operatives from the @entity111 and @entity112 according to @entity114 sources			1
at the weekend , @entity2 ’s entourage revealed he had received ‘ thousands ’ of calls for help from @entity4			1
' @entity124 fighter ' : a man cries after being released from a local police station which was stormed by @entity39 protesters in @entity9 , @entity4 two sides : the protesters can be seen surrounding a @entity4 policeman outside the @entity9 police department reunion : the crowd cheer as released detainees reunite with friend and family outside the police station in @entity9 brotherhood : a protester gets a kiss from a supporter after being released by police he has already secured permission from the @entity20 parliament to use military forces in @entity4 , and has as many as 65,000 in @entity22 and annexed @entity4 , where there was a show of aerial force - strategic bombers and fighter jets - at the weekend			1
in @entity41 , embarrassed troop commanders revealed that donations of food were spiked			0
‘ it turned out that the food contained a substance that induced sleep among the servicemen , ’ the acting head of @entity41 criminal police department , @entity152 , said			0
‘ after about half an hour , about 20 unidentified people arrived in three cars and , taking advantage of their helpless state , took them prisoner along with four automatic rifles , a grenade launcher , a machine gun and ammunition			0
’ they were held overnight before being released yesterday			0
@entity4 faces acute tests in the next week as two regions - @entity170 and @entity172 - stage ‘ illegal ’ referendums which could see them splitting permanently from @entity4			2
western intelligence suspects that @entity22 is engaged in a plan to re-take vast swathes of @entity4 which in tsarist times were called ‘ @entity22 ’ , or @entity22 , stretching from @entity177 in the north - east to @entity9 in the south - west as well as @entity179 in the west			1
under such a scenario , @entity4 would have its east and south lopped off and become a rump state cut off entirely from the @entity51 , with all the industrial muscle and port cities falling to the @entity104			2
in february , before @entity187 was annexed , a mysterious internet petition in @entity22 called on @entity2 to invade ‘ @entity22 ’ - and met with overwhelming approval			2
after 100,000 signed , it was dramatically withdrawn with no traces left on the web but now there is suspicion that it revealed a @entity104 plan			0
in his tv question and answer session three weeks ago , @entity2 dropped another hint			0
‘ @entity196 , @entity172 , @entity170 , and @entity9 were not part of @entity4 in @entity198 times , ’ he said			1
‘ they were transferred in 1920 [ after the @entity200 ]			0
’ @entity4 forces were last night said to be surrounding @entity203 amid expectations its troops were planning to storm the city to free it from control by @entity39 militants .			0
