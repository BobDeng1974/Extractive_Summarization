@entity13 told @entity32 that a @entity34 staff member asked him to remove the shirt due to new terrorism laws			1
the lyrics , from painters and @entity40 ’s 1990 classic single of the same name , was deemed a ' threat ' by staff , who thought the shirt inappropriate			2

' however , a statement from @entity9 claimed the ban was imposed because of the offence the shirt may have caused other passengers			1
