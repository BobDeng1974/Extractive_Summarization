by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 02:43 est , 4 december 2012 @entity2 plans to scupper @entity4 ’s attempts to introduce a ‘ @entity6 law ’ regulating the 300 - year - old @entity7 , government sources say			1
a communications green paper , which the @entity9 could use to try to force legislation on to the statute book , is expected to be shelved			1
editors are meeting the prime minister today to discuss the industry ’s response to last week ’s 2,000 - page report by @entity6			1
opposing sides : prime minister @entity2 , left , plans to scupper @entity4 's chance to force in a ' @entity6 law ' though a communications green paper while @entity4 leader @entity21 , right , insists he believes independent regulation of the press backed by legislation could work concerned : culture secretary @entity25 has voiced her concerns that any legislation could later be used to gag the press the senior journalists were warned by culture secretary @entity25 yesterday that the government will legislate if they do not agree to set up a genuinely tough and independent self - regulatory body			1
but , without the communications @entity32 , @entity4 will have little chance to force the issue			2
‘ that @entity32 is the only thing on which @entity4 might be able to hang some sort of @entity6 clause , and it is going into very long grass , ’ said one source			0
the prime minister last week voiced ‘ serious concerns and misgivings ’ about @entity6 ’s key recommendation of legislative underpinning for a new regulator			1
time for change : @entity6 has recommended legislative underpinning for a new regulator but @entity49 sources said he would tell the industry in @entity49 this morning that there can be ‘ no delay ’ in setting up a new system themselves			2
addressing mps , mrs @entity25 voiced concern that any legislation could be amended by future administrations to gag the press , and warned it would harm the @entity62 ’s reputation as an advocate of free speech			1
‘ can we credibly question and challenge others on issues of liberty and freedom if we place our own @entity59 in a legislative framework ? ’ she said			0
however , she made clear it had not been ruled out as a last resort if editors fail to agree to set up a new , entirely independent press watchdog which meets the principles set out in the judge ’s report			1
‘ the prime minister is clear – we will see change			1
that change can either come with the support of the @entity59 or – if we are given no option – without it			0
be in no doubt that if the industry does n’t respond , the government will , ’ she said			0
she confirmed the action envisaged by ministers ‘ would include legislation ’ if the industry ’s proposals fall short of @entity6 ’s suggestion that a new regulator must be truly independent and able to impose big fines on errant newspapers			2
‘ we will not accept a puppet show with the same people pulling the same strings , ’ mrs @entity25 added			2
however , asked by @entity100 , a @entity101 mp who had indicated she wanted the government at least to consider an underpinning in law , whether she would concede a free vote on the issue in the @entity107 , the @entity25 made clear : ‘ i ’m hoping that there will be no votes on this			1
’ despite another round of cross-party talks on the issue yesterday , @entity4 leader @entity21 again insisted he believed independent regulation of the press backed by legislation could work			1
‘ a large majority of the public also want that change			0
that ’s why we ’re going to draft legislation , working with other parties , the @entity116 and the @entity117 , to show that independent , self - regulation , guaranteed by law , @entity6 ’s proposal , can work , ’ he said			2
lord justice @entity6 , center back , delivers a statement following the release of the @entity132 report at the @entity133 in @entity134 the final report : a man carries copies of the @entity132 report as he leaves the @entity138 where lord justice @entity6 released his report after a year long inquiry @entity101 mps who signed a letter backing laws to police the @entity59 would not vote with @entity4 to force the issue , a ringleader said last night			0
the intervention by the mp , who did not wish to be named , came as splits within the group of 42 deepened			0
seven of the signatories now say a tougher regulator without a law – as advocated by the prime minister – would work			1
while most of the signatories stuck to their guns and believed some form of legal underpinning was unavoidable , a growing number told the @entity159 a robust new form of self - regulation would be the best course , and claimed the @entity4 ’s refusal to accept it was ‘ shameful ’			0
the letter , which circulated last month , was organised by @entity2 ’s former press secretary @entity165			2
‘ the government said they want to produce legislation to show it ca n’t work , we believe it can			2
’ in the @entity107 , deputy labour leader @entity170 said self - regulation had repeatedly failed to prevent unwarranted intrusion by the press			0
‘ we need statute because the current system of self - regulation has failed year after year for 70 years and despite seven major reports , ’ she said			0
‘ the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome			0
’ miss @entity170 said @entity4 was drawing up its own ‘ tightly drafted and forensic ’ @entity32 to demonstrate that @entity6 ’s recommendations could be implemented without the difficulties feared by @entity184 sources said mr @entity21 was determined that it should be introduced			0
however , a @entity185 , which could be brought in by a single @entity4 mp , would stand no chance of becoming law unless the government allowed time for its passage through @entity190			0
the communications green paper has been prepared – but not published – with legislation to deal with issues such as internet piracy and public service broadcasting .			1

government 's own communications green paper could be used by the *opposition* to force legislation on to the statute book
culture secretary @entity25 voiced concern that any legislation could be amended by future administrations to gag the press
