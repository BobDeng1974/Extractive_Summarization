@entity50 tried desperately to resuscitate her partner , @entity32 , who died at their home in the county following a night of celebrations			1
another man – a friend of the couple who is also believed to have taken pills from a batch of ecstasy tablets marked with a ‘ @entity3 ’ logo – remained in hospital last night			1
@entity64 yesterday took the unprecedented move of offering an amnesty to anyone who hands in the tablets , as they desperately attempt to get them off the streets and trace the dealers			1
@entity72 , 30 , said last night that her boyfriend , a labourer originally from @entity74 , was not a regular drug user			0
the pills are described as red and triangular with a @entity3 logo printed on them ( pictured ) he had stayed up late partying at their flat to celebrate his 24th birthday and @entity85			1
she said : ‘ i went to bed at 2am and woke up a few times because him and his friend were making a bit of noise			0
i had no idea that they had been taking drugs			1
‘ every time i got up to tell them to keep quiet , they were looking the worse for wear			0
his friend popped out and when i checked on @entity32 , he was breathing in a funny way			1
i propped him up and went back to bed			0
‘ i then came back in the lounge because he was not making the breathing noise any more			0
’ she dialled 999 at around 9.40am on @entity37 and took advice over the phone on how to try to resuscitate her boyfriend			0
a tearful @entity72 , a recruitment agency manager , said : ‘ then the ambulances and the helicopter came along			0
they tried and tried to save him			0
at one point they got his heartbeat back and then it went again			0
’ she added : ‘ he was in good health , went to the gym and ate well			0
he was a wonderful person who was always helping people			0
’ mr @entity32 was pronounced dead at 10.10am			1
his girlfriend said she wanted his story to serve as a warning to others to avoid drugs			2
‘ if anyone else was thinking of taking them , i would say , “ if you have got that pill in your hand , you either live or die ” , ’ she said			2
‘ drugs are a death wish			2
just do n’t do it , because you will hurt yourself , your family and your friends			0
life is just too short			0
’ @entity21 , also known as @entity29 , worked in a @entity136 factory in the @entity14 town and was found dead on decemeber 24 @entity64 said the drugs are similar to some found in the @entity139 which contained a very high amount of the substance pmma			1
this gives the pills a delayed effect and users often overdose accidentally because they think the drug is not working , leading to a fatal rise in body temperature			0
@entity150 mr @entity19 died around three hours before mr @entity32 at his home 13 miles away			1
mr @entity33 , the only victim outside @entity13 and the surrounding area , was found dead at a house in @entity34 at 1.45pm on @entity37			1

@entity159 mp @entity158 said last night : ‘ it ’s very sad indeed ... if you are buying drugs you are never going to be sure about where they come from			2
’ police believe the men , who were all in their twenties , may have been involved with the drug after emergency services were called to three addresses across @entity13 in the space of one week ( pictured ) it is believed @entity19 had been with friends who lived at the house in @entity31 on @entity85 a spokesman for @entity64 said this is the first time they have come across pills matching this description			1
the force has drawn a link between these drugs and dangerous pills with a similar appearance which were in circulation in the @entity139 last month			2
those tablets had a large concentration of @entity188 , which acts more slowly than @entity189 , the main component of ecstasy			2
this causes people to take more pills because they think they are not working			0
@entity188 can cause high body temperature and an increased heart rate			0
there are also concerns the pills could be linked to 120,000 similar ones seized in @entity201 last month			0
police say the drugs may also be in a round shape with the 's ' superman logo embossed on them ( pictured ) chief inspector @entity207 said : ' as well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs , it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths			2
' we would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you do n't know where they have come from , what they are made up of , or how your body will react to them			2
' if you have been offered drugs in the @entity13 area over the past few weeks , in particular ecstasy , we 'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets			1
