holidaymakers have been warned to be vigilant this summer as @entity3 's coastal seas could to be turned into ' jellyfish soup '			1
pollution , over-fishing and climate change are among the theories being used to explain the increase in the stinging creatures , the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) said			0
the warning comes after the temporary closure of the @entity15 nuclear power station in @entity16 last month when swarms of moon jellyfish blocked its water intake cooling systems			1
surge : @entity21 - or moon jellyfish - swarmed the @entity15 nuclear power station in @entity23 , @entity16 last month jellyfish : the nuclear plant , pictured , closed both their reactors to allow the filters to be cleared of jellyfish the @entity5 is now asking beach - goers to take part in its crowd - sourced survey of jellyfish numbers in the seas to learn more about them			1
' there is strong evidence that jellyfish numbers are increasing around the world , including @entity3 seas , and these increases have been linked to factors such as pollution , over-fishing and possibly climate change , ' said @entity5 biodiversity programme manager @entity43			1
' we should consider jellyfish populations as important indicators of the state of our seas , and the @entity5 jellyfish survey helps provide some of the information we need to understand more about them			1
' species usually seen in @entity3 waters are the barrel , moon , compass , blue and lion 's mane jellyfish			1
those brave enough to get close to the jellyfish are being urged to ' look but not touch '			2
most of the species have only a mild sting but some , like the lion 's mane , which usually comes as far south as the @entity67 and @entity68 , have a strong - but none - fatal - sting			0
@entity3 - bound : marine experts have suggested some species of jellyfish could come as far south as the @entity67 or the @entity68 coastline ( pictured ) the nuclear power station @entity15 was shut down for two days after jellyfish inundated the seas near the site			1
local fishermen on three trawlers helped to clear the moon jellyfish from the seas around the station			1
@entity83 , which operates the plant , said reactors were shut down as a precautionary measure and there was no danger to the public at any time			0
jellyfish are the staple diet of the critically - endangered leatherback turtles , seasonal visitors to @entity3 waters who migrate from their tropical nesting beaches to feed on the jellyfish blooms			2
examinations of dead leatherbacks stranded on @entity3 shores have revealed that they feed on several species			0
by comparing the distribution of jellyfish with environmental factors such as sea temperature , plankton production and current flow , scientists hope to understand what influences the seasonal distribution of jellyfish and leatherbacks in @entity3 waters			2
this year there have been three confirmed leatherback sightings since june , all spotted in waters off western @entity3 where jellyfish blooms have been reported			2
' most jellyfish bloom in summer , but some species can survive the cool winter months too , ' mr @entity43 added			0
' this year , we received our first reports of the huge but harmless barrel jellyfish off @entity123 back in early january , and this species has occurred in huge numbers in the @entity67 and beyond ever since , with reports received from north @entity127 to the @entity128			0
' since may we have also received reports of large numbers of several other species of jellyfish from various coastal all sites round the @entity3			0
' dr @entity135 , of the @entity136 , who analyses the survey data , said the study , which has been going since 2003 , had yet to throw up any ' shocking ' revelations but that there were signs of a link between jellyfish numbers and the @entity144 , a climatic phenomenon which affects the flow of warm air between the tropics and northern regions			0

warning comes after jellyfish swarm closed @entity16 power station last month
