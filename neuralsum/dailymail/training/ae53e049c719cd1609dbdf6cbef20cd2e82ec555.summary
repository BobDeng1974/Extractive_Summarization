a look at the @entity2 table does not make happy reading initially for those championing @entity6 managers			1
the bottom six teams are managed by @entity8 although , apart from @entity10 , you ’d expect them to be there			2
but look to @entity12 and you ’ll find plenty of room for optimism			1
@entity17 takes his @entity19 side to @entity20 fifth in the table and just three points behind the champions			1
he is doing a very good job			2
@entity19 have beaten @entity25 and @entity26 this season and both times @entity28 has tactically outdone his opposite number			1
that is impressive when you consider that @entity33 and @entity34 are two of @entity36 ’s most decorated managers			2
he obviously has a good footballing brain			2
@entity38 was back in training for @entity20 on friday after returning from international duty @entity41 and @entity42 could feature for @entity20 on saturday one of the most impressive things about @entity28 is transfer dealings			1
he realised that the atmosphere at the club was n’t as it should be when he took over from @entity48 and had no hesitation in moving players on to get rid of cliques : out went @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			2
@entity17 had been a player in that dressing room so he knew who he needed to keep and get rid of to restore harmony			1
he also knew what a good signing and influence @entity61 would be from his earlier spell at the club and made sure he brought him back			2
a manager from outside the club might not have thought of him but @entity61 has been superb			0
he is one of the most underrated players in the @entity2 , @entity68 were wrong to let him go and not many in the league could hit a free kick with the accuracy he did against @entity26			0
@entity19 got off to the best possible start by beating @entity25 on the opening day @entity28 has assembled a squad of match - winners : @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 are foreign signings who must have been expertly scouted and who look incredibly promising			1
it meant that even without three key men — @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 — they could still beat @entity26			0
to spot @entity79 among the stars at the @entity90 was particularly impressive			0
he obviously sees something good in @entity92 under 21 captain @entity93 too			0
the 22 - year - old is on loan from @entity68 and there are n’t many midfielders of that age playing such a key role in our top flight			1
they will all need to be on fire as @entity19 have never scored at the @entity103 and have n’t won away at @entity20 since 1951			1
@entity104 ( left ) and @entity61 celebrate the second goal in 2 - 1 victory over @entity26 behind all that exciting attack is @entity108 , the central defender who continues to improve			1
can you think of any centre halves who are performing better than him for club and country at the moment ? i ca n’t			0
things could easily have been different , of course			0
before the @entity26 game , @entity19 had won just one league game in seven , were four points off the relegation zone and @entity28 made some pretty aggressive comments about @entity125 ’s @entity124 diving , calling him a cheat			1
he has a rougher edge than those who have gone before him at the @entity132 and he might have to choose his words more carefully in future			0
but he has regained his composure now and his performance should inspire @entity6 coaches that they might get their big break and encourage chairmen to give them a chance			0
@entity19 's @entity17 has got the better of @entity33 and @entity34 this season it is good for a player to be fast - tracked — @entity143 did so with @entity144 at @entity145			1
it was another good call from chairman @entity147 who has now appointed @entity149 , @entity150 ( now boss in the @entity152 with @entity153 ) , @entity154 and @entity48			0
they all play attractive , passing football too			0
if they can scrape a result on saturday , with their next two games at home to @entity163 and @entity164 , maybe it ’s time to start dreaming .			0

@entity17 takes his @entity19 side to the @entity103 fifth in the table
the @entity12 side have *n't* won at away at @entity20 since 1951
