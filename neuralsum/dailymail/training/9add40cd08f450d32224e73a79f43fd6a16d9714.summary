the @entity0 said thursday it will consider whether retailer @entity1 discriminated against a @entity3 woman who was denied a job because her headscarf conflicted with the company 's dress code , which the clothing chain has since changed			1
the justices agreed to hear the @entity12 administration 's appeal of a lower court decision that ruled the @entity16 , @entity15 - based company did not discriminate because the job applicant did not specifically say she needed a religious accommodation			1
at issue is how employers must deal with laws that require them to make allowances for a worker 's religious practices , as long as doing so does not cause the business too much hardship			0
a federal judge initially sided with the @entity30 , which sued on behalf of @entity31			2
standing up for herself : @entity31 , 20 , of @entity33 , says @entity1 refused to hire her because she wears a head scarf for religious reasons			1
she has taken her complaint to the @entity37 @entity0 the agency alleged @entity31 was n't hired at a @entity33 , @entity40 , store because her hijab violated @entity1 's ' look policy ' , described at the time as a ' classic @entity44 collegiate style '			1
but the 10th @entity37 @entity45 reversed that decision			1
the appeals court said @entity31 never directly informed her interviewer she needed a religious accommodation , even though she was wearing the headscarf during her interview			0
@entity1 , which has faced slumping sales and could face negative publicity in the case , has pressed on with its defense , saying it was @entity31 's obligation to explain any special needs based on her religion			1
the company has settled two other @entity30 discrimination lawsuits over the same issue and it changed its ' look policy ' four years ago to allow its workers to wear hijabs			0
in their brief for the @entity30 , government lawyers said the appeals court ruling undercuts legal protection for religious practices because it unfairly places the entire the burden on the job applicant to raise the issue			2
under fire : @entity1 and @entity1 say they never received actual notice of a religious conflict with its company - enforced dress and appearance codes sometimes job applicants are n't aware of a potential conflict between a religious practice and a company policy , the government said			2
in this case , the @entity30 says @entity31 never requested an accommodation because she did n't know about the ' look policy '			2
the agency also claims that @entity1 was clearly on notice that @entity31 needed to wear the headscarf for religious reasons , or else it would n't have denied her a job			0
@entity1 's lawyers say the law is clear that an employer must have actual knowledge that a religious conflict exists before any accommodation is offered			0
the company argues that job applicants ' are not permitted to remain silent and to assume that the employer recognizes the religious motivations behind their fashion decisions '			0
the @entity37 @entity30 sued on @entity31 's behalf after she was denied a job at @entity107 in @entity33 in 2008			1
now the @entity37 @entity0 will make a ruling on the case in 2013 , the company settled two other @entity30 discrimination suits filed in @entity112			1
in one case , a judge determined the company fired a @entity3 worker from a @entity112 store , while another judge said it refused to hire another woman in the state because of her refusal to remove the hijab during work			0
the court will hear arguments next year in @entity30 v. @entity125 , 14 - 86 .			0

@entity31 interviewed for a job at @entity107 in @entity33 , @entity40 , in 2008
she *missed* out on a job because her hijab violated the company 's ' look policy '
the @entity37 @entity30 sued on @entity31 's behalf and won
however the 10th @entity37 *circuit* court of appeals reversed that decision
on thursday the @entity0 said it will rule on whether @entity1 discriminated against @entity31 's religious *beliefs*
the case will look at whether workers need to tell *prospective* employers about religious *exemptions* before they are hired
