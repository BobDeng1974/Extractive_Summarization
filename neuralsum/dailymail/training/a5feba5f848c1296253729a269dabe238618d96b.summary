late night snacking has led to @entity2 women becoming bigger than their @entity4 counterparts claims chef @entity5 late night snacking , too much wine and not cooking with butter has led to @entity2 women becoming bigger than their @entity4 counterparts claims chef @entity5			1
mr @entity5 , who moved to the @entity2 in the 1970s , says it is @entity2 's culture which has led to females being among the heaviest in @entity11			0
' one glass of wine a day is better than six ! again , cook with butter - just use a little and most important , do not eat after 7 o'clock in the evening , ' he says			1
' that 's a big tip because most people eat more at night and that when you put the weight on			0
be ware of your snacks as well , ' advised the @entity4 chef who has recently been teaching @entity24 singer @entity23 how to cook			1
' yes @entity4 woman do get fat , but it seems that there is a food culture in @entity4 which often defines how people eat and in @entity4 we eat well			1
' ' eating well , a varied diet , which omits bacon and eggs every morning or six glasses of wine at night , means a better diet , ' he told @entity38			1
' one glass of wine a day is better than six ! again , cook with butter - just use a little and most important , do not eat after 7 o'clock in the evening , ' says the tv chef ' my mother @entity41			1
she 's 91 and when i was a boy she gave me a deep understanding of food , its purity and nobility , and how it celebrates life , ' he said mr @entity5 , who credits his mother as his culinary inspiration , also said she was a fine example of a petite @entity4 woman			1
she ’s 91 and when i was a boy she gave me a deep understanding of food , its purity and nobility , and how it celebrates life , ' he told @entity59			1
mr @entity5 , whose @entity61 restaurant boasts two @entity63 stars , spent @entity64 with his mother after his @entity66 born fiancee @entity65 called off their engagement late last year			1
it was only in october the chef said this country ’s attitude to food was changing , with a growing appreciation of the importance of quality produce and that @entity4 was ' losing its strong food culture , while @entity2 is gaining one '			1
@entity5 has recently split up with his @entity66 - born doctor fiancee @entity65 ( both seen right ) but he has now taken to the kitchen to school singer @entity23 ( left ) in the art of cooking mr @entity5 , who credits his mother as his culinary inspiration , also said she was a fine example of a petite @entity4 woman despite saying @entity2 women are fatter then the @entity4 , last year @entity5 attacked a @entity88 contestant because she was ' thin '			1
the chef sparked anger when he wrote on @entity91 , mistakenly referring to @entity92 as the show ’s winner on the night of the final			2
he tweeted : ' @entity88			0
not much skills , female tears and a winner so thin who makes me doubt of her love for great cooking , baking			0
' but @entity92 hit back , writing : ' @ raymond - blanc ‘ female tears ’ ? ! and what has anyone ’s size got to do with it ? ' i do n’t care if you ’re a patisserie king - do n’t be an idiot			2
' @entity5 later apologised , tweeting co-host @entity113 : ' apologies if i upset people this morning			0
i would like to congratulate you on a show			0
best @entity118 ' figures in recent years have shown that @entity2 women are now officially the most overweight in @entity11			0
a quarter are obese – so fat it threatens their health – according to alarming figures			0
but it is not just @entity2 women - men are doing almost as badly , with more than one in five classed as obese			2
experts are especially concerned by the young age at which so many women here are developing serious weight problems			0
fifteen per cent of women in @entity133 are obese , while they are slimmer still in @entity4 ( 12.7 per cent ) and @entity134 ( 9.3 per cent )			1
only the @entity135 and @entity136 , which are not included in the @entity138 league table , have higher obesity rates in the developed world			0
@entity141 , director of policy and public affairs at the @entity144 , said the @entity2 led the field in obesity			0
but he added that in almost all developed countries two - thirds of adults are overweight or obese			2
‘ levels of fatness are increasing all the time , ’ he said			0
‘ they go from overweight to obesity and affect more than 60 per cent of adults in most countries '			0
butter : @entity157 , @entity158 at @entity159 's , @entity156 would disagree with @entity161 's advice about cooking with butter			0
she says : ' butter is rich in saturated fat and this is a major health concern			0
it is our high saturated - fat intake that helps make cardiovascular disease our most common cause of death , claiming 193,000 lives a year			1
saturated fat increases your risk of heart disease by increasing blood cholesterol levels , particularly the ' bad ' ldl cholesterol			0
' men should consume no more than 30g of saturated fat a day , and women no more than 24g to protect our heart health , and i believe we should try to stick to this			2
' two teaspoons ( 10g ) of butter provide more than 5g of saturated fat			0
swapping to a polyunsaturated or olive - oil - based spread reduces that amount to a mere 1.5g			2
so choosing between butter or a spread can greatly influence your saturated - fat intake			2
' eating late at night : the tv chef says snacking late at night can contribute to weight gain - and he is correct			1
scientists warned last year found that eating while we stay up to browse the internet or watch a late film is likely to be contributing to rising obesity levels			2
the research came after tests on mice			0
one group were allowed to eat only during an eight - hour period , while a second group could graze on what they wanted all day and night			1
@entity135 researchers found that even though the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories , those who ate at set times during the day did not become obese			2
they suggest that those who ate when they wanted to gained weight because they disrupted their body clock – and they believe the same principle may apply to humans			0
drinking alcohol : @entity5 says drinking six glasses of wine at night can led to weight gain			2
official guidelines state women should not regularly drink more than 2 - 3 units a day - that ’s no more than a standard 175ml glass of wine ( @entity221 13 % )			1
the average glass of wine has 140 calories			1
@entity224 and eggs for breakfast every day : the @entity63 - starred chef says women should not eat bacon and eggs every morning , but a high - fat breakfast of bacon and eggs may be the healthiest start to the day , a study at the @entity235 study			1
' the first meal you have appears to program your metabolism for the rest of the day , ' said study senior author @entity240 , @entity241 , associate professor of medicine in the @entity243 of @entity244			0
this study suggests that if you ate a carbohydrate - rich breakfast it would promote carbohydrate utilization throughout the rest of the day , whereas , if you have a fat - rich breakfast , you have metabolic plasticity to transfer your energy utilization between carbohydrate and fat			1

' one glass of wine a day is better than six , ' advises @entity256 - starrred chef
he holds his 91 - year - old mother up as an ideal @entity4 petite woman
