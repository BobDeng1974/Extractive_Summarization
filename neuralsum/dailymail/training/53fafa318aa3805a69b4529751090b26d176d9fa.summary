@entity0 is out of @entity2 ’s clash with @entity3 on wednesday night and now faces a race against time to be fit for next week ’s @entity7 decider against @entity8			1
the news is a bitter blow for the @entity12 champions with @entity13 already out of the trip to @entity15 and @entity16 a major doubt			1
@entity0 ended sunday ’s win over @entity19 complaining of discomfort in his hamstring and @entity2 yesterday confirmed that their influential captain will miss tonight ’s trip to the @entity25 and the home game against @entity27 on saturday			1
@entity2 went down to nine men late on at @entity19 after @entity0 came off @entity2 captain @entity0 had only recently returned from an injury lay - off the @entity31 defender was sent for more scans yesterday to determine if he will have a chance of playing in the final @entity34 tie a week today			1
with @entity13 suspended after his red card against @entity36 and @entity16 having missed the last six games with a knee injury , @entity2 could go into their biggest game of the season without three of their biggest stars			1
‘ @entity0 is not able to play against @entity3 or @entity27 , ’ said manager @entity42 , who is still without @entity43 and @entity44			1
‘ we ’ll see if he makes it against @entity8			1
that will depend on the opinion of the doctor			0
‘ it depends what degree of muscle injury he has			2
it ’s very difficult to know in this moment if he can play against @entity8			1
‘ @entity16 is improving , we ’ll see on thursday if he can be in the squad list for @entity27 but i ’m not sure			0
i think it ’s difficult			0
’ with @entity58 banned tonight following his sending - off at @entity19 and @entity59 still not match fit , @entity0 ’s absence also hands @entity42 a problem for the game at @entity3 , where @entity2 have lost 1 - 0 on their last four visits			1
@entity63 , whose only two appearances this season have been in the @entity66 and @entity67 , or @entity68 is set to partner @entity69 in defence as @entity2 look to keep pace with @entity73			1
‘ we have three options and we will see which two of them will play , ’ said @entity42 , who also insisted that the decision to keep @entity75 does not hinge on the outcome in @entity77			1
despite @entity2 ’s poor record at the @entity25 , @entity81 is confident they can end the losing sequence there after three wins in a row in all competitions			0
@entity3 became the first team to shut @entity73 out on saturday but @entity81 is convinced that @entity89 , the @entity12 ’s 12 - goal top scorer , will find a way through			2
‘ in the past we have not had good experiences against @entity3 , ’ said the @entity91			2
‘ but up front we have someone who is flying and he can help us unlock any defence in the world			2
so we have to capitalise on that and hope he can make a difference			0
centre back @entity58 is suspended for wednesday night 's visit to @entity3 either @entity63 ( left ) or @entity68 is likely to partner @entity69 ( second left ) ‘ we had a lack of confidence earlier in the season but everything is coming back			1
’ meanwhile , @entity3 midfielder @entity103 says @entity2 can expect the same treatment served to @entity73 when they bid to break down @entity3			2
midfielder @entity103 set the tone for the @entity3 ’ resistance during saturday ’s stalemate and warns the champions that @entity109 will employ the same tactics this evening			2
‘ if we can go with the same game - plan and repeat the performance we put in on saturday then i ’m sure we ’ll come away with something , ’ he said			0
@entity109 admits that he can not explain @entity3 ’s home hoodoo over @entity2			2
‘ it is incredible , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t know how and i do n’t know why			0
after what we did against @entity73 , we want to do something similar but with a goal			0
‘ we need to get a bit better and we will see what happens			0
i will take another 1 - 0			0
@entity2 see an opportunity having closed the gap on @entity73 and they do not want to lose any more games			0
they will come here to win			0
