by @entity0 published : 18:08 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 20:10 est , 22 october 2013 poor standards : a study has found that @entity4 school leavers had poorer literacy , numeracy and problem - solving skills than their grandparents the collapse in educational standards was caused by the end of the @entity15 grammar school system , experts said last night			1
a report this month found that @entity4 school leavers had poorer literacy , numeracy and problem - solving skills than their grandparents – the only place among 24 wealthy nations where this was the case			1
but a new analysis of the data has found that @entity15 ’s over- 55s actually outperform their peers in other countries			1
researcher dr @entity29 said this was down to the quality of @entity15 schools in the @entity33 and early seventies			1
he added : ‘ the general decline in performance is due to the ageing process			0
the @entity15 was the only country where there was a blip			2
‘ it would seem that primary and secondary education was so good that it still has an effect today			1
’ many grammars were replaced with comprehensives in the @entity34			0
today , there are just 164 left			2
this decline in selective education corresponds with the last significant intake of grammar pupils whose scores today as over- 55s are so high			1
those who left secondary school in 1975 would be 56			2
dr @entity29 , a reader in psychology at @entity58 ’s @entity57 , said that in almost every nation studied , individuals showed a general improvement in the three areas until they reached their mid to late - 20s			1
this was followed by a sustained fall until retirement , which was put down to ‘ general cognitive decline due to ageing ’			0
but the only exception was the @entity15 , where the older generation significantly outperformed contemporaries in other nations			0
education : @entity15 's over- 55s outperform their peers in other countries - a fact that researcher say is down to the quality of schooling in the 60s and 70s ( library image ) he said : ‘ the school system changed from one where children went to a secondary school based on ability , to one where they went to any school , irrespective of ability			1
‘ it is most likely many factors played a role in our findings but @entity4 and @entity96 did so unusually well [ in the 55 - plus age group ] compared to other countries that it makes sense grammar schools were a major factor			1
’ the first comprehensives were set up in 1946 , and huge expansion began in 1965 under @entity105 ’s @entity104 government			0
when the @entity107 took power in 1970 it was too late to reverse the decline in grammar schools			0
by 1975 , most local authorities had abandoned the 11 - plus exam and adopted the comprehensive system			0
there was also a trend away from ‘ streaming ’ or ‘ setting ’ pupils according to ability within state schools under @entity104 after 1997			0
mixed : 16 to 24 year olds in @entity4 and @entity96 came 22nd in literacy and 21st in numeracy tests streaming puts some pupils in the top classes for all subjects , and setting places them in classes in each subject according to ability			1
by 2007 , the proportion of lessons taught according to ability stood at just 40 per cent , while in some subjects , such as history and geography , nearly three - quarters of lessons took place in mixed - ability classes			0
the original report by the @entity142 looked at core skills among 16 to 65 - year - olds			2
those aged 16 to 24 in @entity4 and @entity96 came 22nd in literacy and 21st in numeracy			1
but 55 to 65 - year - olds were among the best educated in the developed world			0
the @entity107 said the findings showed the last @entity104 government let academic performance slide , even as marks went up			0
dr @entity29 suggested exam marks had become ‘ more realistic ’ since education secretary @entity156 demanded an end to grade inflation			1
he said underperformance among 16 to 55 - year - olds compared to other countries could be explained by the comprehensive system			2
experts have criticised the dumbing down of syllabuses , particularly since the @entity34 , and the introduction of trendy teaching methods			0
mr @entity156 is introducing a curriculum that involves more learning by rote and in - depth study			0
education expert professor @entity172 , of the @entity173 , said : ‘ grammar schools picked out highly able children and brought them together with very good teachers and helped them develop			2
‘ in @entity4 there was an emphasis on grammar and being accurate and maths required the ability to carry out basic calculations			2
now there is a more cavalier attitude			0
’ @entity185 , of the @entity186 , added : ‘ there is no doubt that the advent of the comprehensive was the beginning of a downward trend in literacy , numeracy and problem solving			1

school leavers had poorer literacy , numeracy and problem - solving skills than their grandparents , a report by @entity58 has found
@entity4 only country among 24 wealthy nations where this was the case
dr @entity29 found over- 55s outperform peers from other countries - a fact he says is down to *excellent* education standards in the 60s and 70s
' education was so good it still has an effect today , ' he said
