this parent is giving a whole new meaning to ‘ school bag ’ as he helps a class of primary pupils safely cross a river by taking them in a plastic bag			1
when the children in @entity11 village , @entity12 , near @entity13 in northern @entity14 could not get to school due to spring floods , one father found an unorthodox solution			2
as the nearby suspension bridge was out of action , he put the children in a plastic bag to keep them dry , and carried them across the flooded river			1
in the clip , one of the children ’s fathers can be seen carefully wrapping up each child in a plastic bag before he launches himself neck deep into the raging torrent			1
once at the other side , the still dry child jumps out , before the man swims back to pick up another			0

miss @entity83 told the newspaper : ‘ it 's normal			0
that 's the only way to cross the stream because no bridge can stand floodwater			0
‘ i 've taught here since september last year			0

staying ' safe ' : despite everything parents tell you about not putting a plastic bag over your head , this parent ensures the bag is tied up tight staying afloat : the parent carried the bag in one hand and swam across with the children one by one ready for school : a girl getting out of the plastic bag the other side of the river in @entity11 village , @entity12 , near @entity13			1
