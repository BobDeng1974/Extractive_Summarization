she was everything to me : @entity2 with wife @entity3 at a social event in 2012 nestled with the many photos and mementos of his 35 - year marriage lies a letter that @entity10 actor @entity2 wishes he had never had to read			1
written by a stranger , its contents are unimaginable to most of us			0
yet for @entity2 it has provided some small semblance of comfort following the suicide of his wife @entity3 , recounting , as it does , the last minutes of her life			1
for , while on screen the distinguished actor has become a global star as @entity10 's dr @entity24 – keeping millions of fans guessing if his unrequited love for @entity27 might end in marriage – in private , for the past 18 months he has been struggling to come to terms with @entity3 's death			1
on july 17 , 2013 , the woman he thought of as his rock left home and jumped in front of a train at @entity39 station			1
' she was the most gentle of people – she hated it if i had even a minor altercation with anyone , so the idea that she could have done this , inflict that on herself , is something i can not comprehend , ' he says softly			0
work and the close friendship of the @entity10 cast members – who have become like a second family to him during the past five years – has helped			1
' a little squeeze on the shoulder from @entity56 as she leaves the make - up trailer is enough to show me i have wonderful support , ' he says			0
' @entity3 would sometimes come to @entity10 get - togethers with me , and became friends with the actresses @entity61 and @entity63			1
people were attracted to @entity3 , she was such a vibrant person			2
' like so many suicides , there was no note , no inkling of the tragedy to come			2
two nights before her death she was at a drinks party swapping numbers with friends			0
there was even a holiday marked in the diary			0
' i certainly do n't believe that , when we were at the party , she was thinking she would be dead in a couple of days , ' says @entity2 , who met his wife in 1975 when she was 18 and they starred together in a @entity87 play			2
the letter about @entity3 's death came from a woman who had witnessed the suicide			1
' it was the most beautiful letter from a lady who had been standing beside her on the platform , ' recalls @entity2 67			1
' she told me that @entity3 was calm , did n't seem distressed in anyway , looked almost serene			1
' as the train came in it seemed as if @entity3 was looking over the track as if she had lost something , and then she was gone			1
' the actress 's career had taken off when she was 19 , playing @entity104 in a musical adaptation of @entity107 's @entity106 starring @entity108 and @entity109			2
she went on to star in a string of tv hits including @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity116 drama @entity117			1
on screen : @entity2 as dr @entity24 in @entity10 with @entity120 as @entity27 @entity3 suffered from anorexia as a teenager – something @entity2 attributes to the death of her mother from pneumonia when she was seven			1
but it was n't until she turned 50 that her eating disorder returned			0
ironically , as @entity2 's career flourished with the success of @entity10 , his wife felt hers was over , something he believes triggered the anorexia			1
' it is like alcoholism , ' he maintains			0
' you can not touch a drink for 50 years , but you are still an alcoholic			2
it might have gone into mental remission for years but it was still there '			2
her close friend , actress @entity140 , warned @entity3 she would die unless she sought help when her weight dropped to six - and - a - half stone – severely underweight for her 5ft 7in frame			1
' @entity3 felt washed up , that no one remembered her and no matter how much i reassured her she felt worthless , a failure , ' @entity2 says			1
' of course she was n't , but that is what this business can do to you , especially if you are a woman			0
' @entity2 admits relations between them had been strained the night before her death			2
' we were meeting friends at a pub in @entity159 and when i arrived @entity3 had already had a drink , ' he says			2
' being anorexic i knew she had to eat before she had a drink otherwise the alcohol was fast - acting so i was policing her for the rest of the evening			0
' walking back home later that evening , she pressed me , trying to have an argument and i was n't having it so we were a bit sniffy with each other , but it was nothing more serious than that			0
' we got up a bit earlier than usual because we had the decorators in , but @entity3 was doing her usual morning exercises			2
as she did her sit - ups , i even remember stepping over her at one point to get ready in the bathroom			0
' i heard the front door close and assumed she 'd gone for a long walk to clear her head			2
i knew she was going to meet friends to see a matinee performance in @entity185			0
' @entity2 , who recently played sir @entity186 in the @entity188 's adaptation of @entity189 , admits he initially became concerned when he heard @entity3 's mobile phone ring			1
' i 'd no idea she had n't taken it with her until i saw a text saying , ' @entity104 , where are you , we are in the bar ? ' ' he continues			0
then at 4pm the police arrived with the news that @entity3 was dead			2
warning : @entity3 with close friend and actress @entity140 , who was worried about her friend ' all she had on her was her wedding ring and my oyster card [ for the @entity206 ] , ' he recalls			1
' i understood what had happened but my heart just could n't believe she 'd done it			0
i remember thinking who the hell was i living my life with all these years			2
' the days and months that followed were a blur			0
' initially you are on auto - pilot , my friends and neighbours looked after me – every morning at 8.15am one would arrive with a coffee and a croissant , ' @entity2 admits			1
' then i began to over-socialise and drink like a fish			0
luckily i do n't have an addictive gene and i stopped that			0
there were also days when i had the feeling that i just did n't want to wake up			0
' somehow you settle into a kind of rhythm and you just stagger on			0
' with his on - screen success , the couple were more financially secure than they 'd been for years and @entity2 believed they had reached a stage in their life where they could look forward to their future			1
the guilt , however unwarranted , is relentless			0
' it does n't matter how much i know intellectually that it was not my fault , there is something at the heart of me that believes if i 'd maybe told her i loved her more or noticed some small sign , anything ... ' sweethearts : @entity2 and @entity3 had starred in a @entity87 play together and were married for 35 years slowly @entity2 's life is changing to accommodate the new normality forced upon him , and the loss of equilibrium in his life which he is not sure he will ever get back			1
he is anxious not to be defined by @entity3 's death and the normally private actor agreed to speak to @entity257 only to highlight a moving @entity188 documentary which shows the devastating aftermath for family left behind after a suicide			1
@entity2 , who has volunteered with the @entity262 since 1987 , had no doubts about returning to work there six months after @entity3 's death			1
' initially when i went back i was n't on the phones , but gradually i started dealing with calls again , ' he reveals			0
' maybe i have a greater understanding when someone calls to talk now , i am perhaps more aware of the little triggers			0
' sadly , many of his memories of the woman who captured his heart with her charismatic personality and sparkling laughter have started to fade			0
' i ca n't imagine cuddling her any more and i do n't feel her presence anywhere – that spiritual connection , it 's gone , ' he says			0
@entity2 admits to missing the intimacy of a relationship – ' i hate the idea of being a single , old bloke ' – but says @entity3 is an almost impossible act to follow , adding : ' she was everything to me			1
