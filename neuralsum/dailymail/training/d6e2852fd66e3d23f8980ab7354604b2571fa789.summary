@entity0 today looks to his wife @entity1 to help the @entity2 in the ' fight of our lives ' to stay in power			1
the @entity2 leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in may , but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the @entity14 or @entity15			1
asked if he would rather get into bed with @entity17 or @entity18 in a new power - sharing deal , mr @entity0 joked ' it 's @entity1 every single time ' , as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school			1
however , mr @entity0 is adamant that he could yet hold the balance of power , if @entity15 and the @entity40 both fall short of an overall majority			1
embarking on a whirlwind of tv and radio interviews , mr @entity0 attacked both other parties			1
he said both of the larger parties had veered away from the political centre ground since the last election , while @entity2 wanted both a ' stronger economy and a fairer society '			1
asked by @entity52 whether he would rather ' get into bed ' with mr @entity17 or mr @entity18 in a hung parliament , mr @entity0 insisted : ' @entity1 , every single time , if you must put it that way			1
' the @entity58 are expected to make a joint appearance at a school today to promote @entity2 policies on free school meals and childcare			1
the @entity2 leader added : ' i really do think that if either @entity15 or the @entity40 were to run this country on their own again , the country would go backwards			1
it would go backwards economically under @entity15 , it would go backwards socially under conservatives			2
' i 'm really pleased that we are the party saying that there 's a more hopeful , positive vision of the future built around a simple old - fashioned liberal concept , which is opportunity for everybody			0
' the @entity58 tried their hand at making scones with the children , including measuring milk into a jug mr @entity0 's visit came after a media blitz of tv and radio interviews , in which he argued the @entity2 did not face wipeout in 2015 mr and mrs @entity58 were joined on the visit to the school by business minister @entity90 ( right ) @entity91 has faced claims a vote for @entity94 makes a @entity15 government more likely voters who back @entity94 at the next election risk ' going to bed with @entity91 and waking up with @entity18 ' , @entity17 warned last week the prime minister said the next election would be a ' straight fight ' between @entity15 and the @entity14 , and a vote for @entity94 made it more likely that @entity18 becomes prime minister in 2015			1
the pm warned voters toying with the idea of voting @entity94 that they were really voting for @entity15 he told the @entity40 conference : '' let 's be clear			1
this is a straight fight			0
it does n't matter whether @entity111 is hung , drawn or quartered , there is only one real choice			0
' the conservatives or @entity15			2
me in @entity116 , or @entity18 in @entity116			2
' if you vote @entity94 – that 's really a vote for @entity15			2
' he went on : ' here 's a thought : on 7th may you could go to bed with @entity91 , and wake up with @entity18			2
i do n't know about you but not one bit of that works for me			0
@entity17 warned that a vote for @entity94 would make it easier for @entity15 to win the next election he told @entity131 's @entity130 : ' in the same way that @entity15 took a very sharp turn to the left , the @entity40 took a very sharp turn to the right			1
' when i went into coalition with @entity17 , the @entity40 said they cared about the environment - they clearly do n't			0
they wanted to protect civil liberties and human rights - they now want to trash them			0
' and that they cared about the most vulnerable in society			0
and yet @entity143 said very clearly last week that their ambition if they were in government on their own is to only balance the books by making the working - age poor make additional sacrifices			0
' he said the @entity2 were making clear ' that 's not a vision we share '			2
mr @entity0 was also forced to deny there was a ' flat ' atmosphere spirit at this year 's conference			0
' it 's an incredibly lively atmosphere here			0
people are really up for it , they 're really up for the fight			0
' we know we 've got the fight of our lives on our hands , but we 're incredibly proud , as i say , of what we 've done and actually people are really relishing getting out there to tell our side of the story on the campaign trail in the coming months			0
' he also revealed he would be reading his main conference speech from a script , and not attempting to memorise it , as @entity15 leader @entity18 tried , but forgot to mention the deficit			1
mr @entity0 said : ' i wo n't be doing the speech from memory			2
i think @entity18 has demonstrated the perils of doing that			2
' a major split has opened up between the @entity14 and @entity2 over how £ 25billion can be raised to eradicate the deficit after the election			1
last week @entity14 chancellor @entity143 made clear it should come entirely from spending cuts , including £ 3billion from freezing benefits			1
but mr @entity0 has insisted some of the money should come from tax rises			0
he told @entity188 's today programme : ' our overall approach is that we want to maintain roughly what we have done in this government , which is that the bulk of the savings come from spending reductions , about 80 per cent but about 20 per cent come from tax increases			0
' on @entity198 , mr @entity0 hinted that he would allow an in - out referendum on @entity201 's membership of the @entity202 if he entered a new coalition with the @entity14			2
' we have said in law for the first time ever , if there is a change in the rules of the @entity202 , the so called treaties , powers are moved from @entity213 and @entity214 to @entity215 , there will be a referendum			0
' i have gone even further than that , i have been saying for as long as i have been leader of this party , when that referendum takes place , the decision should be in or out			0
' our position is clear , there will be a referendum , we have guaranteed it in law , when the rules of the game change in the @entity202 and new things are asked of the @entity201 and i believe that when that is held the question on the ballot paper should be in or out			0
' appearing on @entity234 / @entity233 , mr @entity0 admitted to mistakes in the early days of the coalition , saying he disappeared into the ' boiler room ' of government to make ' gory decisions ' but failed to speak to the public about what he was doing			1
mr @entity0 admitted that the @entity2 ' slightly lost our voice ' in the first year or so of the coalition , as he disappeared into the ' boiler room ' of government to take ' gory ' decisions in an attempt to differentiate the @entity2 dems from both parties , mr @entity0 launched attacks on the @entity14 on fairness and @entity15 on the economy mr @entity0 insisted that despite being at just 6 per cent in the polls , the @entity2 are not heading for disaster in 2015 asked what he would do differently if he found himself in a coalition administration again after next may 's poll , mr @entity0 said : ' i think probably what we would n't need to do next time is what we had to do this time , which was , right at the beginning , i slightly disappeared into the boiler room of the government to make sure we took all these difficult , gory and , frankly , unpopular decisions to pull the economy back from the brink where we found it and to prove to people that coalition government could work			1
' i think we slightly lost our voice in the first year or so of the coalition government and that probably was inevitable because we needed to show people that coalition government could work			1
' i think now people are used to the idea that coalition is what it says on the tin - two parties with different identities - and i think we could be more relaxed about that openly from day one if we were to be in coalition again			0
' mr @entity0 dismissed suggestions that his party , which has slumped to as little as 6 per cent support in the polls , is heading for disaster in the 2015 election			1
' i 've literally lost count of the times , with the greatest respect , that i 've been asked questions saying ' oh , is n't it going to be a disaster ? are n't you going to be wiped out ? is n't it all going to be terrible ? '			0
and every time we confound the sceptics and i genuinely think we will do so next year , ' he said .			0
