think you can come up with a @entity2 last 16 dream team picking one player from each side ? harder than it might , initially , sound			1
as @entity8 ’s elite competition moves into the knock - out stages , @entity6 has endeavoured to devise the best squad - 11 players plus five substitutes - from all 16 remaining teams			1
the only rule is that only one player from each team can be chosen			1
goalkeeper : @entity18 ( @entity19 ) without doubt @entity18 is the best goalkeeper on the planet and there is no competition for a place between the sticks when he is involved			2
conceded just four goals in @entity19 ’s six tough group stage games against @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			2
@entity19 's @entity18 has firmly established himself as the best goalkeeper in the world right - back : @entity34 ( @entity35 ) the @entity35 captain and @entity38 winner with @entity39 makes it in at right back			2
@entity34 , who played every single minute of the @entity38 in @entity41 , can play consummately across the back four and has been one of the stand - out defenders in the @entity2 this season			1
@entity34 ( centre ) has been a mainstay in the right back position for @entity35 this season centre - back : @entity49 ( @entity29 ) there are few better in world football at the heart of a defence than @entity29 captain @entity49			2
there were a number of @entity29 attacking options who narrowly missed out on selection - @entity58 and @entity59 were two strong contenders - but @entity49 ’s presence at the back earned him a place			0
captain @entity49 ( left ) remains a rock at the heart of the @entity29 defence centre - back : @entity68 ( @entity69 ) @entity68 was practically the whole of @entity41 ’s defence in the @entity38			0
they conceded seven in five games with him in the side , then seven in one game without him as they were crushed by @entity39 in the semi-final			1
he has continued that form for @entity69 and has been their best defender this season			0
@entity68 ( left ) continues to show why @entity41 missed him so much in the @entity38 semi-final last summer left - back : @entity85 ( @entity86 ) the @entity87 was the best left - back in the group stages			0
subject to scouting from @entity91 and @entity92 , he is a threat going forward with his pace and crossing ability and equally strong defensively			0
@entity85 ( right ) in action against @entity98 's @entity97 during a @entity101 @entity100 match @entity103 midfield : @entity104 ( @entity105 ) the 21 - year - old is one of the hottest properties in the game			0
comfortable in attack and defence , he would sit alongside @entity111 but remain the more offensive of the central , holding midfielders			0
@entity104 is prone to making astonishing things happen on the pitch			0
@entity104 has been in scintillating form for @entity105 this season and is the driving force in midfield @entity103 midfield : @entity111 ( @entity92 ) every attack - minded team needs a midfielder prepared to sit in front of the back four and act as a shield , and @entity111 has proven this season at @entity92 he is formidable in that role			0
the tall @entity129 is phenomenal at breaking up opposition play with tackles and interceptions			0
@entity111 has established himself as @entity92 's tour de force in their midfield since re-joining the club attacking midfield centre : @entity137 ( @entity138 ) @entity137 is told he is not the world ’s best player , instead the accolade going to @entity142 last month , so he replies with 14 goals in eight games including two hat - tricks			1
he is another who is an obvious choice , in behind the striker , in this side			1
@entity137 shows no sign of slowing as he spearheads the @entity138 team at home and abroad attacking midfield right : @entity142 ( @entity153 ) the @entity155 winner is a cert for his favoured right wing position			1
his 38 goals in 35 games this season , and the fact him not scoring for the past three games is verging on crisis , says it all			0
@entity142 is bidding to win his second consecutive @entity2 trophy with @entity153 attacking midfield left : @entity169 ( @entity170 ) @entity170 manager @entity171 ca n’t stop purring over his new signing and he is unquestionably their strongest player since his move from @entity138 in the summer			1
in a competition with a plethora of potential forward players , the @entity175 just makes it in on the left of the attacking midfield trio			0
@entity169 hit the ground running for @entity170 when he arrived from @entity138 and has not slowed down striker : @entity184 ( @entity185 ) unexpectedly , a @entity185 player is leading the line			1
@entity184 can not be overlooked after his nine goals in the group stage helped the @entity191 club through to the last 16 and put him top of the scoring charts			2
he also had a hand in six other goals , playing a part in every single goal his side scored			2
how our @entity2 dream team lines up substitutes goalkeeper : @entity204 ( @entity205 ) almost made it into the starting @entity207 after conceding just one goal in the six group stage matches			1
that ’s five clean sheets			0
centre back : @entity212 ( @entity213 ) the @entity215 defender has been immense at the back for the @entity218 side in @entity8 , despite their struggles in the @entity218 , and even weighed - in with a goal in the last round of the @entity2			1
centre back : emir @entity223 ( @entity224 ) @entity223 was at centre of one of the leanest defences in the tournament so far , conceding just four goals , and was one of the form players of the group stages			0
attacking midfield : @entity234 ( @entity235 ) hard to leave @entity234 out of the first team , and not to include one of last year ’s finalists , but he has been arguably their best player and there were too many stronger players ahead of him			2
forward : @entity242 ( @entity243 ) the exciting teenager from @entity245 , who only turned 18 two days ago , has already scored six in nine league starts for the @entity249 side including a @entity2 goal to his name against @entity252 .			1
