the 377,000 - square - foot @entity11 is the tallest building in downtown @entity6 , and has been in construction for nearly 15 years			1
the opening of the building will mark the first time @entity5 have a place to practice the ' @entity17 ' program , developed by the religion 's founder l @entity18 in the 1970s			1
while the city was told to expect 10,000 @entity5 this weekend , the crowd gathered outside the @entity11 yesterday was noticeably smaller			1
the @entity22 estimated that numbers could have been less than 6,000			2
in the front row : @entity0 and @entity2 side - by - side in the front row as the @entity27 's @entity11 in downtown @entity6 , @entity7 is opened			1
the building is rumored to have a floor where members can get ' super powers ' jumbo - tron : @entity27 leader @entity34 's speech was broadcast to the large crowd on a large video screen applause : confetti falls as the @entity27 leader @entity34 dedicates the massive @entity11 in downtown @entity6 the ceremony was for parishioners only but even born - and - bred @entity5 could n't get into the exclusive dedication ceremony			1
@entity41 is a third - generation scientologist who belongs to the church in @entity6 , but was n't allowed past the thick security surrounding the new buidling			1
instead , she stood outside the event and tried to get as good a look at the new building as possible			2
' it sounds like @entity51 in there , ' she told the @entity53			0
exclusive : the ceremony was for parishioners only but even born - and - bred @entity5 could n't get into the dedication headquarters : the $ 145m building reportedly will be the only place where a highly classified @entity17 program , first advanced by church founder @entity18 in the 1970s , will be conducted but she did n't seem to hold any grudge against the church for not letting her into the event			1
' thank @entity67 it 's finally done , ' she said			2
' there are so many more people joining the church we really needed more space so we could be more comfortable and do more things for the community , and the response today is absolutely breathtajing			2
we 've been looking forward to this for a long , long time			0
' @entity77 is a second - generation scientologist from nearby @entity78 and he too was n't allowed into the ceremony			0
mr @entity77 climbed a palm tree just for a better vantage point into the ceremony			0
' i 've been watching this come out of the ground for the better part of 15 years			1
it 's huge , ' he told the @entity22			2
after a quick eight - minute speech by @entity27 's leader @entity34 , confetti - rained down and the cathedral 's doors were opened to the thousands gathered outside			1
but for non-church members excluded on the outside , the building 's opening was not a celebration			2
around four people were seen protesting the event in @entity101 masks , while other locals were n't happy at the religion 's takeover of the city			0
long - awaited moment : a live image of @entity27 leader @entity34 is projected on a screen for a crowd tight security : many people were n't allowed into the event to watch the unveiling			1
but they did n't mind			0
@entity41 said : ' thank @entity67 it 's done , we need more space ' huge crowds : thousands of @entity5 were there to see the opening of the building which has been under construction for 15 years the @entity17 course was developed by @entity27 founder @entity18 and promises to boost a person 's perceptions or senses through a series of mental and physical @entity127 believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing , sight , touch , taste and smell we have 57 additional abilities known as ' perceptics '			1
these include an ability to sense blood circulation , balance , compass direction , temperature , gravity as well as an ' awareness of importance , unimportance			0
' in his writings @entity18 described the course as : ' a superfantastic , but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anyone whether @entity153 clear or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing the super power of a thetan			0
' this is the means that puts @entity5 into a new realm of ability enabling them to create the new world			0
it puts world clearing within reach in the future			0
' it consists of 12 separate high - power rundowns which are brand - new and enter realms of the tech never before approached			0
' @entity18 had originally wanted to offer the course in 1978 but many of his staff who had been through the instructor training left the church on completion of the @entity178 a written statement , church spokesman @entity171 said : ' @entity17 is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint , increase his perception , exercise his power of choice , and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities			1
' ' people do n't want to come to downtown @entity6 because that 's all you see â€” big groups ( of @entity5 ) walking everywhere			1
@entity6 could be a really interesting , vibrant place , ' said @entity192 , 62 , of @entity193			2
the local restauranteur sees the center 's opening as a money - making opportunity			0
he opened his new restaurant @entity201 and grill yesterday as well and aims to bring in @entity27 parishioners			1
' the church will play a big part in bringing attractions , festivals and nightlife to the downtown area , and we 're just the first , ' he said			0
' the @entity5 are always well dressed , they look nice , and they keep our city a nice place			0
and they need to eat , too			0
' the group broke ground on the @entity216 - style building in 1998 , but stopped work after finishing the shell			1
for three years , the group ceased construction on the project until the city started imposing $ 250 - a - day fines for code violations			2
scientology defectors have explained that the building 's slow construction is due to church leader 's who have allegedly used the project as a fundraising cash cow			1
an analysis by the @entity22 discovered that the church had raised $ 145million for the building , much higher than the $ 100million it was estimated to cost			2
former @entity237 couple @entity236 and @entity238 of @entity239 , @entity235 contributed more than $ 340,000 to the construction of the @entity11 , before ultimately suing the church in federal court for dragging out the project ' as a shill '			1
church representatives have described the @entity238 's suit as ' frivolous '			2
while the new building is part of a larger complex of buildings that serve as a spiritual retreat for @entity5 , there will be space on the ground floor for visitors to learn about the religion			2
the visitor center will have a ' grand lobby ' with a three - story atrium and exhibits that explain the religion 's belief system and practices			0
the second and third floors are home to offices and classrooms while the basement houses a huge kitchen and dining areas			0
three hundred small rooms for ' auditing ' can be found on the buildings upper floors			0
auditing is the religions form of counseling and a session can cost $ 1,000			0
but the jewel in the crown of the @entity11 is on the fifth floor , where members can pariticapte in the @entity17 program for the first time			1
the @entity17 program was developed by the religion 's found @entity18 and described as one of his greatest discoveries			1
' @entity17 is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint , increase his perception , exercise his power of choice , and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities , ' church spokesman @entity171 said in a statement			1
@entity18 went further in his description of the program saying : ' @entity17 is the answer to a sick , a dying and dead society ... with it we literally revive the dead			2
' as part of that therapy , members will be spun on an anit - gravity simulator blindfolded to improve their ' @entity308 's 57 senses which include sight , smell , taste , blood circulation , and awareness of awareness			0
another interesting feature of the building is the circular running track located on floor six			0
@entity5 use the track for ' @entity320 '			0
basically they run until they have a moment of enlightenment called ' cognition '			0
allegations : former members of the church claim leaders have used the building 's lengthy construction process as a fundraising ploy a giant tent with the phrase '' @entity332 '' on it was set up next to the new @entity11 for its dedication in downtown @entity6 photographers look over the crowd which is estimated to have been around 6,000 strong @entity338 audience : the @entity27 leader @entity34 addresses the crowd of @entity5 during the dedication ceremony for their massive @entity11 large crowds : roads around the building were closed off for the event not present : scientologists @entity345 and @entity347 were not present			1
