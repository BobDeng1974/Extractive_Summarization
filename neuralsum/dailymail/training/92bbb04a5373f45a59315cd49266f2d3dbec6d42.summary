@entity123 , 18 , enjoys posting @entity10 videos of him ' harassing ' people in public
his latest attempt to film a video went horribly *wrong* when some of his victims called the police
he was arrested and faces battery charges , which could *potentially* result in a jail sentence
he has *apologized* but is unrepentant and plans to post the wedgies video just as soon as the police give him back his camera
