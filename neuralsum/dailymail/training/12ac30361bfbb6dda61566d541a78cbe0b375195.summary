by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 04:01 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 04:10 est , 2 march 2014 @entity3 put its armed forces on full alert and braced for an invasion on saturday night after accusing @entity7 of ‘ naked aggression ’ for sending 6,000 troops into its @entity11 territory			1
tensions rose alarmingly as @entity7 soldiers , armed with machine guns , surrounded key strategic sites on the peninsula , including the parliament and @entity19			1
@entity7 president @entity20 won parliamentary backing to deploy his forces anywhere in @entity3 under the pretext of protecting @entity7 interests			1
occupation : armed men patrol around the regional parliament building in the @entity11 city of @entity29 on saturday but @entity3 ’s new interim president @entity30 warned his country was threatened with a ‘ military invasion and occupation ’ and ordered increased security at nuclear power plants and airports			1
prime minister @entity37 said last night there was ‘ growing concern ’ over the crisis			1
he added : ‘ there can be no excuse for outside military intervention in @entity3 , a point i made to president @entity20 when we spoke yesterday			1
’ @entity49 president @entity48 also spoke to @entity20 in a 90 - minute call and warned of the consequences of continued ‘ violation of international law ’			1
but @entity7 ’s actions seem to be calling his bluff as a hitherto covert invasion turned into a chillingly obvious new wargame			1
the news came as : the @entity59 called an emergency meeting , and @entity3 has asked the four permanent members other than @entity7 – the @entity49 , @entity63 @entity62 and @entity64 – for help as @entity66 ban ki - moon said he was ‘ gravely concerned ’ about the situation			1
president @entity48 has warned @entity7 against any military intervention in @entity3 after the country 's new leaders accused @entity72 of deploying forces in the @entity1 region flashpoints : @entity7 moves in yesterday began with troops surrounding key positions			1
soldiers patrolling in the @entity11 capital @entity29 wore no insignia but spoke with @entity7 accents			1
then @entity7 claimed gunmen from @entity82 tried to seize the @entity83 , and although the claims were heavily contested the @entity11 premier asked for @entity20 ’s help to ensure peace in his region , which was granted			1
after president @entity48 ’s warning , @entity90 leaders urged all sides to refrain from anything that might increase tensions			0
it is hard to envisage a more volatile situation – and @entity63 , along with the @entity49 , is a guarantor of @entity3 territorial integrity under the @entity100			1
@entity102 ambassadors will meet today to assess the situation			0
yet the reality on the ground is that @entity7 is already controlling @entity1 with support from many residents			2
crowds flocked yesterday to the centre of @entity29 to show support for the @entity7 soldiers			1
‘ i am very happy to see them here , ’ said @entity111 , a pensioner in @entity112			0
others waved military flags , sang patriotic songs and chanted : ‘ @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity7			2
’ ' invasion ' : these troops , amassed outside the @entity11 town of @entity120 , have been decried by the @entity3 government as an occupying force there is growing antagonism towards the @entity125 over its support for the new government in @entity82			1
there were also chants of ‘ @entity130 , @entity130 ’ , a reference to the special forces disbanded after being accused of killing 88 protesters in @entity82			2
at @entity29 ’s @entity130 base i found barricades erected , drivers honking horns in support and people taking food to the paramilitaries			0
one man warned of bloodshed if @entity3 forces moved on them			0
according to one witness , the latest @entity7 troops went into @entity29 city centre shortly after 5am			2
within hours , troop trucks were on the streets and cordons were erected around government buildings			0
the soldiers were supported by locals organised into what they called civil defence groups , who blocked streets , supported by traffic police			2
‘ we are here to ensure stability and return power to our legally elected president , ’ said the leader of one unit			2
‘ the revolution in @entity82 was illegal			0
we think it was carried out by the @entity169 powers			0
their goal is to cause civil war			0
’ @entity7 ’s foreign ministry claimed ‘ unknown armed men from @entity82 ’ had tried to seize the @entity83 on friday night , leaving several people injured			1
it said the assault was defeated by ‘ the decisive action of self - defence squads ’			2
but guards at the ministry yesterday said they were unaware of any overnight attacks			0
@entity11 police also rejected the claims			2
among the crowds protesting in front of parliament i found @entity188 , 72 , who spent 15 years in a @entity190 jail and five years exiled in @entity191 after joining a 1961 uprising			0
‘ even if there are sacrifices now they will be for the benefit of our children , ’ he told me			0
@entity188 seemed happy to believe @entity7 propaganda , which focused heavily on far - right involvement in the @entity82 protests			2
‘ the people have decided to join @entity7 where there is no oppression and people are free – and there are no @entity207 , ’ he said			2
but support for deposed president @entity209 seems to have withered after his flight to @entity7 , despite his insistence he remains @entity3 ’s rightful president			1
‘ he betrayed his country , ’ said activist @entity213 , 47			0
‘ he should have stood his ground and taken responsibility for his deeds , even if he was lynched			0
’ @entity3 ’s new president signed a decree yesterday declaring that thursday ’s appointment of @entity221 , the @entity11 premier of @entity1 , was illegal			1
@entity221 insisted he had taken control of local troops , customs and tax administration			0
he also brought forward a referendum on the region ’s status to the end of this month			0
if it goes ahead despite the opposition of the @entity82 government , it will almost certainly endorse some form of independence under the wing of @entity72			0
there are also signs of tensions between the majority @entity7 and the @entity240 , who comprise 250,000 of the two million @entity242			0
