by @entity0 published : 05:34 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 05:48 est , 30 may 2012 a mother - of two has endured feeling permanently seasick since spending a few days on a friend 's boat two years ago			1
@entity4 decided to live on a house boat with her architect husband @entity6 and their two children while they built their dream home in @entity12 , @entity13			1
but after just a few days of staying on the boat in @entity16 , ms @entity4 was left feeling dizzy , struggling to balance and vomiting up to five times a day			1
queasy : after just a few days of staying on the boat in @entity16 , @entity4 was left feeling dizzy , struggling to balance and vomiting up to five times a day the 44 - year - old company director , said the symptoms started when a water taxi raced passed and shook the boat violently while she was asleep			1
she said she felt like she was rocking from side to side all day , but took some seasickness tablets and hoped the symptoms would pass			2
but ms @entity4 was horrified when even after moving off the boat within days she still felt seasick - with symptoms so severe she struggled to walk down the road			1
with constant dizziness and sickness and finding it increasingly difficult to work , ms @entity4 went to see a specialist who diagnosed her with the rare condition , @entity35 ( @entity35 )			1
there is no known cure for the condition , and ms @entity4 still suffers from symptoms over two years later			1
she said : ' having spent years designing other people ’s dream homes and 15 years looking for a site , @entity43 and i had found a suitable piece of land in @entity13 on which to build a house			0
' we sold our flat to fund the build and with our two children moved onto a house boat , kindly lent to us by a friend			1
construction site : @entity4 and her architect husband @entity6 filmed during the building of their home on the @entity61 show @entity60 ' we moved on the friday , and i was fine until the monday morning when a river taxi went racing under @entity63 at the same time as the tide being very high			1
@entity35 syndrome means ' illness of disembarkation			2
' it is a very rare condition that is triggered by travel , such as on a boat or plane			1
the symptoms last long after the journey has finished			0
instead of the usual symptoms of motion sickness , such as nausea , people with mal de debarquement syndrome feel as though they are rocking or bobbing , and may describe it as feeling as if they are still on the boat			2
many people feel like this for a few hours after a journey , but for people with mal de debarquement syndrome , the symptoms can last for months or even years			0
there are currently not any known cures for the condition			0
@entity91 ' i remember it was 6.30am and i leapt out of bed in absolute terror , the whole boat was violently rocking from side to side and i could n’t get my bearings at all , i got off the boat as quickly as possible and went to work			2
' that day i felt very unstable on my feet , i was literally rocking from side to side			0
i went to the chemist and bought myself acupressure wrist bands to ease the sickness and also sea sickness pills , neither of which helped in any way			0
' that night i was very nervous about being back on the boat			0
the next morning the same thing happened and again , i left as quickly as possible			0
with the nausea and dizziness now unbearable , ms @entity4 took to the internet to find out if there was anything she could do to ease the symptoms			1
having previously suffered from labyrinthitis , an ear condition which can cause imbalance ms @entity4 thought she may be suffering from it again as the symptoms she was experiencing were very similar			1
she contacted a labryrinthist specialist and within twenty minutes of meeting him , he diagnosed her with @entity35			1
ms @entity4 said : ' i was devastated , not only was there no cure , my symptoms at this point were unbearable and by now i was throwing up regularly , he suggested we move off the boat immediately and find somewhere else to live			1
' luckily some friends of ours came to the rescue and let us move into a flat of theirs they had bought to renovate			0
' we moved the next day , having stayed on the boat for less than a week			0
' ' i went for a series of vestibular tests and it was one of the most horrific three hours of my life as my balance and vision was put under exceptional testing			0
final creation : the family lived on the boat until their innovative mews home in central @entity13 was built dream home : the couple even designed a light - up dance floor in their @entity12 home ' again i was throwing up and for someone who rarely cries , i was weeping constantly as my life with these symptoms had become unbearable , i was begging for this torture to end			2
' i was prepared to do anything , if only someone could take this condition away			0
' but ms @entity4 was distraught to discover there was no cure for her condition and although her symptoms have eased over the years , she still faces a daily battle with the condition			1
ms @entity4 and her family have since moved into their dream home which featured on homebuilding show , @entity60 last year			1
but she said despite living on dry land for the last two years there are still days when her symptoms are so severe she finds herself holding onto the wall to walk down the street			2
she added : ' i have had @entity35 for two years , and on some days my symptoms are so dreadful that i feel that awful misery coming back			2
' thankfully i love walking and one of the best things to do is to walk whilst looking left and right over and over again			0
' stress makes the symptoms worse , along with headaches			0
on days of stress and headaches i ’m rocking and rolling all over the place			0
' one of the things i find hard now , apart from living permanently with @entity35 , is the fact that many people see it as an amusing and trifling illness			2
' what they do n’t understand is it is an incredibly invasive and life changing condition , the only relief i ever experienced was when i am driving or sleeping			0
' i can no longer do many things that i was easily capable of			0
