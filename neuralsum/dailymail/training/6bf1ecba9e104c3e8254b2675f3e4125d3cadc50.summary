extraordinary new research has emerged suggesting @entity2 's beheading was faked by @entity3 , and that the @entity5 aid worker was killed by a gunshot , not decapitated by @entity7 as implied			1
medical experts examining an @entity3 propaganda video in which mr @entity2 's severed head is seen at the feet of @entity3 ' @entity13 executioner in chief , have concluded that he is likely to have been shot dead			1
the claims add further weight to speculation over why mr @entity2 's full body was not shown in the video			1
unlike @entity3 ' previous sickening filmed murders , he did not speak directly to camera before being killed and his body was not shown after the murder			2
a popular theory is that mr @entity2 was killed before the video was shot because he did not cooperate with the jihadists - either refusing to give a final speech on camera or possibly even fighting back while the murder was taking place			2
@entity51 , a researcher at @entity52 think tank that will be publishing the analysis this week - told @entity54 : ' we have had a senior face and neck surgeon independently look at some of the screenshots we took			0
' ' his initial assessment was that a contusion above mr @entity2 's left eye was a gunshot wound			1
closer analysis of the wound reinforced that initial assessment , leading him to believe that the wound was probably the cause of death , rather than beheading , ' he added			0
digital analysis of the film also suggests that @entity7 may have been superimposed in the frame where he is seen standing over mr @entity2 's severed head			1
the raises the question of whether mr @entity2 was murdered in an entirely different location to the @entity44 soldiers			2
it is understood that shadows supposedly cast by @entity7 do not match up with the alignment of the sun and that the digital editing programme @entity39 - which costs around £ 200,000 and is used in @entity82 - had been used to add shadows , albeit in an amateur fashion			1
sickening : the latest @entity3 video showed a group of @entity44 soldiers being marched along a desert road in @entity89 and brutally murdered by a large number of unmasked militants unusual : @entity2 is pictured while working as an aid worker in @entity44 before his capture			1
his murder is not actually shown in the film and he does not deliver a final message as other @entity98 hostages have another alternative claim emerged just days after mr @entity2 's death and suggested that the aid worker could have been accidentally killed in a @entity5 - led airstrike			1
speaking over @entity106 from a hiding place near the @entity109 border , the head of the @entity105 resistance group @entity104 is being slaughtered silently claimed there are reports that mr @entity2 died on november 5 , when coalition fighter planes and drones pounded @entity114 in northern @entity44			2
the resistance leader , a 22 year old medical student who uses the @entity116 , said in an interview : ' i think @entity3 did n't execute @entity2			0
an @entity3 soldier told me this morning that @entity2 died in an airstrike on 5th november in @entity121 and that is why they did n't show a video of the execution			0
' the soldier was one of the first who arrived on the scene to secure it after an airstrike hit the islamic state court building in @entity121			0
he said there was immediate high security and nobody was permitted entry to the building , not even @entity3 fighters			0
then two bodies were taken out of the building and put into a speeding car			0
' mr @entity116 claims that the soldier said one of the bodies was that of mr @entity2 .			0

mr @entity2 's severed head was seen in a sickening @entity3 murder video
experts believe bruise seen above left eye was in fact a gunshot wound
suggests @entity5 aid worker was already dead when militants severed head
digital analysis also raises questions over where mr @entity2 was killed
*inconsistent* shadows cast by @entity7 suggests he was superimposed into shot using £ 200,000 editing *software* *favoured* by @entity82
