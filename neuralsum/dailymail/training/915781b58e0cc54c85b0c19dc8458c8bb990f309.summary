by @entity0 , @entity1 editor last updated at 6:12 pm on 20th january 2012 @entity2 : almost nine per cent of the holding company that owns the water and sewerage firm was bought by the @entity6 the @entity6 government has bought nearly 10per cent of @entity10 ’s biggest water company in a move that could signal an economic revolution			1
it is the first of many investments in the @entity10 ’s infrastructure and business sectors that are predicted to transform the nation ’s commercial dna			1
projects as diverse as a new @entity21 airport in the @entity22 to vast new wind farms , nuclear power plants , the @entity26 rail line and a new super sewer for @entity21 will be trying to attract investment from the @entity6			2
separately , house builders , tech companies and manufacturers , who are struggling to borrow from @entity10 banks , will be vying for a slice of the ‘ @entity35 ’			1
@entity6 ’s sovereign wealth fund is buying 8.7per cent of @entity2 in a deal that could be worth £ 1billion			2
the fund is fabulously wealthy , with reserves running to £ 300billion , which the @entity6 government is keen to invest overseas			0
however , the idea of an arm of a @entity51 @entity6 government – albeit one that is adopting a more capitalist and consumer - led approach – owning a stake in a key strategic businesses is controversial			0
man on a trade mission : chancellor @entity54 addresses the @entity55 in @entity56 earlier this week			2
it is unlikely that nations such as the @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 would contemplate foreign businesses or governments owning their infrastructure			1
a tv poll by @entity66 found 90per cent of people are opposed to @entity2 being foreign owned			0
however , advocates insist that @entity10 will benefit from the promised @entity6 investment that will fuel economic growth and create jobs			1
the chancellor , @entity54 , welcomed the announcement saying : ‘ this is a significant step by @entity6			0
it is a vote of confidence in @entity10 as a place to invest and do business			1
‘ this investment is good news for both the @entity10 and @entity6 economies			1
’ good news : former trade minister lord @entity79 welcomed the investment by the @entity6			1
the former trade minister lord @entity79 said the investment was good news			1
but he said it was wrong that @entity10 companies do not have the same freedom to invest around the world			1
speaking to the @entity87 programme , he said : ‘ there are two worries			0
everyone praises @entity10 for having an open market , including the @entity6 , but it is not quite a level playing field			1
‘ i do n’t think you would find the @entity60 doing this , or the @entity61 or the @entity59			1
’ lord @entity79 said pressure should be put on other countries to open up their economies to allow @entity10 business to expand around the globe			1
the sovereign wealth fund is run by @entity104 ( @entity104 )			0
it announced the purchase of the stake in @entity2 in a one line sentence			0
the company did not reveal the price paid , however its stake in @entity2 , which has 14 million customers across @entity21 and the south , is thought to be worth more than £ 1billion			0
the @entity104 chairman @entity114 announced plans in november to invest in @entity117 and @entity59 infrastructure , beginning in @entity10			1
the plans are part of a drive to spur global growth and so underpin the demand among western consumers for @entity6 goods			0
@entity104 was created to invest abroad in the hope of earning a better return on a portion of @entity6 's £ 2trillion in foreign reserves			0
mr @entity114 has made clear that the fund 's investments are made on commercial rather than political grounds and are aimed at making a profit			2
huge investments funds : @entity136 's @entity135 skyline underlines the massive scale of the superpower 's economy which has given them the cash to buy into firms like @entity2 the decision to invest in @entity2 follows mr @entity54 ’s return earlier this week from a visit to @entity6			0
during the trip , he outlined plans to make @entity21 the international centre for trading in the @entity6 currency , the @entity151 , which could be worth billions to the @entity152 and the wider economy			0
@entity2 , once publicly - owned , has gone through several foreign hands since privatisation in 1989			0
it was owned by @entity156 of @entity60 for many years before being sold to a consortium called @entity158 , headed by the @entity160 bank @entity159			2
in december , another huge sovereign wealth fund , the @entity162 , bought 9.9per cent of @entity158			0
it is an attractive investment because profits are effectively guaranteed by a regime that allows price rises every year			2
fury : protestors made their feelings plain after it had been agreed that @entity172 would be subject to a £ 11.5billion takeover from @entity59 giant @entity174			1
@entity176 : the sovereign state fund sovereign wealth fund , the @entity162 , bought 9.9per cent of @entity2 holding company @entity158 in december			0
@entity6 entrepreneurs have already made tentative steps into buying @entity10 businesses			1
for example , @entity181 , which is run by @entity183 ’s richest man , @entity182 , bought @entity185 in august for £ 2.4billion			0
other famous names to fall into @entity6 hands include @entity188 and @entity189			0
last year a @entity6 food company made an unsuccessful approach to buy @entity192 , home to famous brands such as @entity195 and @entity197 ’s digestives			2
in the past , @entity10 governments have taken a hands - off approach to allowing foreign corporate giants to snap up important @entity10 businesses , including water and energy companies			2
the result is that @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 business giants now own a huge proportion of @entity10 ’s infrastructure			1
however , giving the green light to foreign investment has created controversy			2
for example , the decision to allow @entity212 of the @entity59 to buy @entity172 only then to lay off thousands of workers drew condemnation			2
similarly , the idea that four of the ‘ big six ’ energy firms are foreign owned has angered consumers			0
@entity221 and @entity222 are both @entity60 , @entity223 is @entity61 and @entity224 is @entity225 - owned			1
the @entity225 also own @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity230 airports through @entity232 ’s ownership of @entity233 .			0

investment comes after @entity236 made @entity238 plea for investment in @entity10 infrastructure
trade giant says ' i do *n't* think you would find the @entity60 , @entity61 or @entity59 doing this '
