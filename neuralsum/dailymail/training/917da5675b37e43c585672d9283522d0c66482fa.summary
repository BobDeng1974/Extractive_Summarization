investigators in @entity7 claim that someone with a very similar name to her father is director of the cafe where ms @entity2 is said to be working			1
the last reports of her whereabouts were back in 2011 , when it was believed she may have been holed up in an inner - west suburb of @entity24 after strange signs with her name scrawled on them emerged			1
ms @entity2 fled @entity3 18 years ago , having become the first foreigner to be given bail on serious drug charges , after her millionaire father , @entity30 , had paid around $ 55,000 to secure her temporary freedom to await future court appearances			1
it had been claimed by police that she was carrying opium when she was first arrested as she tried to fly out of @entity9 - a charge that can result in the death penalty - but that was reduced to 4kg of hashish and 500 amphetamine tablets after her parents arrived in the country with a top lawyer			2
ms @entity2 told police she had been paid to take a backpack to @entity45 for a @entity47 man named ' @entity48 ' , and she was set up as a distraction from a larger smuggling operation			0

the woman , who was 20 years old at the time of her imprisonment , was allegedly residing in an inner - west suburb of @entity24 in 2011 then in 2011 small , fascinating signs written on pieces of plaster and wood , popped up around the inner - west suburbs of @entity24 suggesting that @entity71 was living in the area - and may have even scrawled one of them herself			1
written on a small block of white - painted wood , it has been screwed into the tree and the following words written on it in black paint : ' @entity2			0

' just two days earlier another small sign was discovered , written on a piece of plaster that had been painted red , and stuck on the side of a house			0
