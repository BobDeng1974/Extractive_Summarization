when @entity2 manager @entity1 lost his temper and took out his anger on a cooler box before picking a fight with @entity8 boss @entity7 , it brought back memories of many a touchline scrap			1
the technical area of the @entity12 seems to have a way of bringing out the worst in managers - only last year @entity15 attempted a headbutt on @entity8 's @entity17			1
so , with tuesday night 's flare - up in mind , @entity18 looks back at our top 10 technical area spats			1
@entity8 boss @entity7 and @entity2 's @entity1 played down their spat and have now shaken hands @entity7 is held back by the assistant referee during his clash with @entity1 on the touchline things turned sour when @entity7 and @entity1 began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart as the pair locked horns @entity7 makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in @entity1 's direction @entity15 swears at @entity35 , january 11 , 2014 the sight of a 52 - year - old man calling a 60 - year - old a ' f * * * ing old c * * * ' seemed to shock many - and @entity15 later apologised for his ' heat - of - the - moment ' outburst			1
a @entity44 goal disallowed for offside while @entity35 's @entity46 were 1 - 0 up prompted the row between the two bosses and as the fourth official looked to separate them @entity15 had a pop at his opposite number			1
the @entity53 ' reminded him of his responsibilites ' - a bit of a let - off for the man now in charge of @entity60			2
@entity15 ( centre ) and @entity35 clashed over a disallowed goal back in 2014 @entity63 and @entity64 let off steam , april 22 , 2006 for such a usually mild - mannered man , @entity64 does seem to get into his fair share of rows with other managers - and on this occasion it was @entity72 's @entity63			1
@entity63 's side refused to put the ball out in the build - up to @entity76 scoring an opening goal at @entity78 while @entity79 had a man down			2
this infuriated @entity64 , who was challenged on his views by @entity63			2
they were separated by the fourth official but @entity64 still had to go back for one last pop at @entity85 - and he perhaps had the last laugh with @entity79 equalising and eventually pipping @entity72 to fourth place in the @entity89 by two points			2
@entity64 ( left ) and @entity63 had a disagreement over putting the ball out of play for an injury @entity95 vs @entity64 , october 5 , 2014 these two have history dating back 11 years , and they still do n't seem to get on to this day			1
@entity95 's arrival in the @entity89 back in 2004 , when @entity64 's @entity79 were champions , heralded the end of the north @entity102 club 's annual title hopes - and @entity95 certainly has a way of getting under his opposite number 's skin			1
just over 12 months after his return to the @entity89 in 2013 and he was winding up @entity64 again			2
the @entity107 took exception to @entity110 's challenge on @entity111 in a 2 - 0 @entity113 win at @entity114 and stepped into @entity95 's allocated area			1
some verbals from the @entity117 saw the pair come face - to - face before @entity64 pushed the @entity121 boss in the chest			1
he later said he had ' nothing to apologise for '			0
@entity64 pushes @entity113 manager @entity95 during @entity113 's clash with @entity79 this season @entity95 was furious with @entity64 's behaviour and even brings up the lack of punishment to this day the pair have history and have consistently rowed since @entity95 arrived in @entity130 back in 2004 @entity131 tells @entity64 to ' f * * * off ' , april 17 , 2011 the third of a @entity64 trio of incidents - but on this occasion he was remarkably restrained			1
@entity79 looked to have kept their title hopes alive at the @entity137 with a @entity139 penalty eight minutes into stoppage time but @entity141 kept his cool to slot in a 102nd - minute spot - kick to level things and effectively hand the title to @entity146			0
@entity147 manager @entity131 was n't too happy with @entity64 's touchline protests and at the whistle after @entity141 converted he approached the @entity79 boss with his arms outstretched and shouted ' it 's a penalty , p * * * off ! ' before adding ' it 's a penalty , f * * * off ! '			1
it 's fair to say he got his point across			0
@entity157 takes on @entity158 , march 25 , 2010 @entity157 was criticised for his lack of results against big clubs but on this occasion his @entity163 side managed a win at the @entity166 - and wound up his opposite number at the same time			0
both managers were sent off following a physical confrontation with @entity158 trying to barge @entity157 out of the way and then seeing the @entity171 square up to him			0
they were escorted down the tunnel by police such was the animosity			0
however , the pair shook hands after being told they had to share a lift to watch the rest of the game from the upper tier			0
@entity158 pushes @entity157 during their spells as @entity46 and @entity163 managers referee @entity185 saw the stoppage - time clash worthy of sending both managers to the stands @entity189 and @entity190 square up , march 2 , 2011 old firm clashes always tend to be heated occasions , whether in the stands or on the field , but @entity189 and @entity190 extended the rowing into the technical area back in 2011			0
three red cards , 13 cautions and 34 arrests at @entity200 told the story of the afternoon and @entity189 angered the home dugout with something he said at the final whistle			0
the two squared up and pushed each other before being pulled apart			0
@entity189 got a two - match ban for his troubles while @entity190 's previous record saw him take a four - game suspension , but the @entity211 would have been the happier after a 1 - 0 win			1
@entity190 makes his point clear to @entity214 assistant manager @entity189 on the @entity200 touchline @entity217 's grip on @entity218 , february 7 , 2015 even a month on , nobody really seems to understand what was going through @entity217 's head on the touchline at the @entity222			2
what started out as a jokey exchange suddenly became more sinister as the @entity226 boss seemed to pin down the @entity60 midfielder by the throat as he looked to resume play with a throw - in			0
the fact that @entity217 had failed in a bid to sign @entity218 a few months back added to the confusion			0
@entity217 appeared to grab @entity218 around the throat and the floored player was seen mouthing ' get off me '			0
things got even more strange in the aftermath when @entity217 dismissed the incident as ' light - hearted ' and told journalists that he could ' look after himself ' and then seemed close to the sack before eventually keeping his job			0
@entity217 clashed with @entity218 when @entity226 hosted @entity60 last month @entity226 boss @entity217 ( left ) appears to put his hands towards the neck of @entity218 in february @entity95 's gouge on @entity247 , august 17 , 2011 it 's a rare occasion that the @entity117 admits he was in the wrong , but he did here , which gives you an idea of how shameful his actions were towards @entity255 's then - assistant			1
during a familiar @entity258 @entity257 clash , @entity95 stole up behind @entity247 while a touchline row was already going on and jabbed a finger into his eye			2
@entity247 shoved back and both were handed bans			0
' i should not have done what i did , obviously not , ' @entity95 later said			2
' the person who messed up there was me			0
' @entity268 rows with @entity269 , february 16 , 2011 recognised as two hard - nuts of the game , not many people were keen to get between @entity269 and @entity273 as they rowed at the @entity274			0
having been beaten by @entity72 at home in the @entity276 , @entity269 seemed to want to distract from the defeat by picking on the @entity72 bench			0
a fierce full - time shouting match between the two ended with the @entity280 grabbing the @entity72 man by the throat before aiming a headbutt at him			0
@entity269 got a four - match ban , but given @entity268 's record as a player he was probably lucky @entity288 's @entity287 did n't have a go back - and the @entity72 manager admitted as much			2
@entity268 and @entity269 come close after @entity72 's win over @entity291 in the @entity274 @entity269 grabs @entity72 's assistant by the throat as @entity72 manager @entity288 tries to seperate them @entity15 headbutts @entity17 , march 1 , 2014 @entity15 , then @entity44 boss , was sent to the stands after headbutting @entity8 's @entity17 at the @entity12			1
with the @entity296 3 - 1 up , @entity17 shoved past @entity15 as he went to retrieve the ball for a throw - in - and the @entity44 boss was unimpressed , coming together with the @entity8 player and pushing his head into his face			1
he received a £ 100,000 fine from his club , £ 60,000 from the @entity53 , was given a formal warning by @entity44 and was slapped with a three - match stadium ban and a touchline ban for a further four games by the @entity53			2
@entity15 's punishment represented the longest ban for a manager in @entity130 since 1989 - and he also underwent anger management counselling in the aftermath			1
@entity15 and @entity8 's @entity17 confront each other on the touchline at the @entity12 last season @entity15 appeared to lay a headbutt on @entity17 in ridiculous scenes while @entity318 watched on a steward escorts @entity15 from the pitch and he was later given a hefty fine and ban for his behaviour			1

@entity1 refused to apologise for touchline spat with @entity7
the pair squared up during @entity8 and @entity2 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity12
@entity18 picks out some famous *flashpoints* on the touchline
