@entity1 @entity0 has criticised the inability of @entity4 footballers to adjust the pace of their game to suit the hot conditions expected at the @entity8			1
' as a coach , it happened to me several times , ' said the former @entity14 and @entity15 manager			1
' i would ask for a lower tempo to respond to certain technical and tactical details , but i could n’t do anything , they all continue the same			0
i have looked over some of the examples of their goalkeepers , and they have made some incredible mistakes			0
' @entity23 , @entity24 ’s first opponents in @entity37 , have not won since september but @entity0 , who did not win an international cap , believes they are better equipped than @entity40 ’s team to cope with the heat and humidity of @entity43 , in the @entity45 rainforest			1
' i ’ve noticed some difficulties for @entity23 but the @entity1 players have the value of flexibility , they can change position , ' he said			1
' they may lack a true identity , but at a physical level our work from the past two weeks will be better than that of the @entity4 , who are exhausted			1
no goo enough : @entity0 believes @entity24 will not be able to adapt to the heat in @entity37 getting down to it : @entity24 stars @entity25 , @entity62 and @entity64 training on friday ' @entity24 are missing parts , the reserves are not up to scratch			1
the players are tired - i really like @entity25 but he arrives in these competitions cooked , because he plays a lot of games in the season			0
' he gives all of himself in every game and the @entity37 temperatures will be very hard for him			0
in @entity24 they do not have a winter break and it is great to play at @entity78 , but they then pay for this in june			2
in this period , fatigue can be devastating			0
' @entity24 have freshness , youth , but it will be difficult for them to go through			2
they are unable to manage themselves			0
they always put in the maximum and always have to give 200 per cent			0
' @entity0 picked out @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity27 as ' interesting talents ' in the @entity24 squad and hailed teenager @entity90 was ' one of the best full - backs in @entity92 '			1
but he added : ' the @entity4 have a problem			2
they do not attack the space and must have a better understanding			0

former @entity14 manager *slams* @entity4 players for not being good enough to play at a *slower* tempo
@entity0 claims @entity24 will be exhausted and will lose to @entity23
@entity1 says @entity24 *'s* reserve players ' are not up to scratch '
