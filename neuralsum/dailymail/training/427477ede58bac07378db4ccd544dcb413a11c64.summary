by @entity1 reporter an exhausted – and soaked - owl takes a breather on a canoe ’s deck after it was rescued from a freezing @entity7 lake by a local adventurer			1
the @entity9 was found in the cold waters of @entity11 , just north of @entity12			0
once the owl had been transported ashore and dried off , it was able to fly off to the safety of the forest			2
thanks for getting me hoot : the exhausted @entity9 rests atop of the canoe deck after it was rescued from the freezing @entity7 lake @entity9 , or @entity9 , differs from a majority of owls as it is not nocturnal , i.e. it is active during the day			1
like many owls , it feeds on small rodents and mammals as well as other birds			0
its name hails from a similarity in appearance and behaviour to hawks and can be found in @entity32 and across @entity33 and northern @entity34			0
lucky bird : canoeist @entity36 found the owl floating in the water and rescued it from a sure death in the icy temperatures phew : once safely ashore , the owl was dried off and returned to the forest wet and wild : the bird was found in @entity11 , north of the capital of @entity12 , in @entity7			2

@entity9 saved from @entity7 lake by a local canoeist
once ashore , the bird was dried off and could fly to safety
