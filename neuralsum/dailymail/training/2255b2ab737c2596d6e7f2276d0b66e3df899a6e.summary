it is one of the smallest self - governing territories in the world and is home to just 30,000 people but that has n't prevented @entity7 from launching its own beauty pageant			1
indeed , @entity10 has been running since 1959 when @entity11 took the title and , in 2009 , spawned the winner of @entity14 in the ( perfectly formed ) shape of @entity16			1
now @entity17 , 39 , one of the organisers of the 2014 edition , has revealed what working on one of the world 's smallest beauty pageants is really like			2
glamorous : miss @entity7 organiser @entity17 with the eight women who entered this year 's competition mr @entity17 , who appears on @entity28 's @entity7 : @entity29 in the @entity30 tonight , has been involved with the competition since 2003 and says it is one of the highlights of the @entity35 's social calendar			1
nevertheless , with a tiny pool of candidates to choose from - and an even smaller selection of judges - he says making it happen is n't always easy			0
' all pageants come with their challenges , ' he admits			0
' it ’s really important to remain fair and impartial so we ask the @entity45 to fly judges in from abroad			0
' in such a small community it would be impossible to recruit judges who did n't know at least one of the contestants			0
' looking good : judges put the @entity10 competitors through their paces in the swimsuit round finding enough candidates can also prove challenging , with the @entity35 's small population limiting the pool - particularly as @entity35 women and those from neighbouring @entity61 are n't allowed in unless they live permanently in @entity7			1
despite the challenges , mr @entity62 says he loves working on the show which he describes as a ' big social occasion ' and a cross between sunday night at the @entity67 and @entity29 's @entity68			1
girls taking part in this year 's event 22 - year - old teaching assistant @entity72 , who says entering the competition is a ' childhood dream ' and @entity75 , a 23 - year - old student teacher			2
but , says mr @entity62 , for the girls to emerge triumphant , they 're going to need more than a pretty face and fabulous figure			0
' confidence , personality and i think , above all , coming across as genuine are important factors , ' he explains			0
' a good performance - in short , someone who has taken direction from the producers and then delivered on stage - is also important			0
beautiful : miss @entity7 entrants @entity72 , 22 , ( left ) and 23 - year - old @entity75 ( right ) winning ways : @entity7 has produced one @entity14 winner , although neighbouring @entity61 has had none ' gibraltarian women generally have a real charm and a @entity94 feel about them			1
even so , it 's not just about looks			0
' good looks notwithstanding , mr @entity62 also says there 's more to becoming a beauty queen - in @entity7 at least - than turning up at photo shoots			1
' the pageant has to reflect much more than just physical beauty , ' he says , passionately			2
' talent , personality and , most importantly , charity work are all taken into account			0
' indeed , for the past few years , we have asked each contestant to represent a charity [ on stage ] , which has been an enriching experience for everyone			0
' normally none , or very few , of the young women who embark on the @entity10 journey have done public speaking before			2
small pool : judges have to be flown in from abroad while , thanks to the small population , just eight enter ' when you see them stand in front of hundreds - knowing thousands are watching at home - and they passionately talk about their charities , it is proof that beauty queens really can make a difference and matter for much more than their looks			0
' nevertheless , the man from the tiny territory that has produced as many @entity14 winners as @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 - and more than neighbouring @entity61 which has had none - says looks are one of the reasons for his country 's success			1
' are @entity148 women among the world ’s most beautiful ? ' he says			0
' that ’s an easy one ! yes , yes , yes ! ' not only did @entity29 invent @entity14 , it has won it more times than any other nation barring one - @entity154			1
@entity35 beauties won the title in 1961 , 1964 , 1965 , 1974 and 1983 , although recent years have proved less fruitful			1
nevertheless , @entity35 winners have triumphed on more occasions than almost anyone else , with @entity160 taking third place on the winner 's podium behind the @entity29 and @entity154 and the @entity164 in fourth			1
other countries to enjoy multiple wins include @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 , all of which have won twice or three times			2
along with @entity7 , one - off winners include @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity138 , @entity137 and @entity178 , as well as @entity139 and the @entity179			2
despite being home to approximately 46 million people , neighbouring @entity61 - which dwarfs tiny @entity7 - has never managed to produce a winner .			1

the yearly @entity10 competition *attracts* just eight entrants each time
nevertheless , the @entity35 won @entity14 in 2009
@entity188 , 39 , is the man behind the glamorous annual pageant
neighbouring @entity61 , which has *46m* people , has never managed to win
@entity29 has won the competition more times than anyone but @entity154
@entity7 : @entity29 in the @entity30 , tonight at *8pm* on @entity28
