police say they missed the .380 - caliber handgun @entity9 was carrying during two searches and that he was able to pull it out and commit suicide			1
but his family and activists are skeptical and claim his is one more wrongful death of a young black at the hands of authorities			2
skeptical : @entity9 's family says he was n't suicidal and they are doubting the official police version of events in his shooting bizarre : police in @entity10 , @entity11 , say they missed the small handgun @entity9 was carrying and only found it after he had shot himself in the temple while being held in a squad car ' if you could find a dime bag of marijuana on a person , you could find a .380 , ' his great - aunt , @entity38 , said			1
local authorities are now investigating @entity9 's death , and the @entity45 is monitoring the case			1
@entity10 police chief @entity47 said this week it appears that @entity9 shot himself , but he said he 's waiting on autopsy results which could provide more details about the shooting			1

supporters also have been expressing their doubts about the police account online			2
columnists and pundits have been skeptical of the official police story -- comparing it to the deaths of @entity71 , the unarmed teen who was killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer who claimed self defense , and @entity75 , a @entity65 man shot four times in 2006 when police opened fire on his car as he was leaving a nightclub because they thought he had a gun			1

wanted : officers discovered a $ 10 baggie of marijuana in @entity9 's pocket and also discovered he was wanted on a warrant from @entity58 a @entity96 group called ' @entity97 ' says : ' 21 year old @entity9 was shot in cold blooded murder			1

@entity9 's great - aunt said she has been wondering the same thing , especially since her great - nephew did n't seem to have a sad bone in his body			1

' how do you shoot yourself in the head with your hands handcuffed behind your back ? police are out of control			0
' rapper @entity86 on @entity89 @entity122 , a @entity123 - based attorney representing @entity9 's mother and grandmother , declined to talk about what they believe happened			1
but @entity9 's mother , @entity128 , told a @entity123 television station that her son was n't suicidal			2
police said video and audio recordings , as well as statements from witnesses , show neither officer pulled his weapon nor fired a shot during the traffic stop			0
however , police have refused to release those recordings , citing the ongoing investigation			0
@entity47 said investigators have figured out several ways someone could shoot themselves while handcuffed , although he refused to describe them while the investigation was under way			0
@entity147 , who chairs the criminal justice department at the @entity149 at @entity150 , agreed it was possible			0
' it is very , very , very rare and usually it 's on a missed gun , ' he said			0

that 51 - year - old man survived , @entity156 police spokeswoman @entity162 said			2
she said officers responding to a report of a domestic dispute on wednesday found two knives when they searched the man but missed the gun			0
@entity47 , the police chief in @entity10 , about 130 miles northeast of @entity150 , said most officers eventually miss something in a search			1
rallying cry : @entity9 's death has been compared to the shooting of @entity71 as well as wrongful police shootings in the past ' most of them , sooner or later , you find yourself in a position where you missed a knife or a firearm or some drugs or a razor or something like that , ' he said			1
in @entity9 's case , the searches came after police received a report of a suspicious vehicle driving up and down a residential street in @entity10			1
police pulled the truck over and frisked or patted down the three men inside			0
one of the officers found marijuana in @entity9 's pocket and placed him in the back of a patrol car , without handcuffs , according to the police report			1
@entity9 gave police a false name , but at some point , they learned who he was and that there was an arrest warrant for him in @entity58			2
court records show it had to do with a drug case out of @entity214			0
one of the officers handcuffed @entity9 , searched him again and put him back in the patrol car , police said			2
the officers spoke to the other men in the truck for a while and then released them because they did n't have any outstanding warrants , police said			0
as the officers were getting ready to leave , one smelled something burning and noticed @entity9 slumped over in the patrol car			2
