by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:28 est , 20 august 2012 updated : 08:28 est , 20 august 2012 we are , if the rumours are to be believed , only weeks away from an official unveiling of the next @entity5			0
but a phone company has leaked what it claims is the official front cover of @entity10 's soon - to - be - released upgrade to its @entity5 range , which appears to confirm a larger screen for the bestseller			1
this could be @entity10 's response to other phone companies , who increasingly provide larger ' widescreen ' displays for their top models			1
the new @entity5 5 ? these images purport to show the new version of @entity10 's popular smartphone how it looked before : the older iphones sport a 3.5inch screen phone repair shop @entity28 released two images of the ' @entity5 '			1
it follows rumours that the next @entity5 will be thinner than ever , with a thickness of 7.6mm , making it two millimetres thinner than the @entity33			0
it is believed the @entity5 will be announced on september 12 , with pre-orders opening immediately			2
the phone itself is expected to launch just over a week later on september 21			1
however , @entity10 fans in the @entity38 may have to wait another two weeks until october 5 before getting their hands on a phone			1
@entity10 are notoriously secretive and have not even revealed what they will call their next @entity5			2
it could be ' @entity5 ' , or it may follow this year 's spring @entity44 launch and simply be called ' the new @entity5 '			0
last week , more component pictures appeared to confirm the controversial new ' dock connector ' , the power and data port which has been redesigned - leaving older charger cables and docks useless without adapters			2
leaked : this picture purports to show the the flex cable components for @entity10 's @entity54 and @entity5 incorporating the new smaller dock connector , headphone jack and home button connector change : this picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new @entity5 , with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete the photograph , shared by @entity64 tech website nowhereelse.fr , shows two components , one of which is said to be similar to another apparently leaked picture of a part of the new @entity5			1
as well as the new dock connector , the part also seems to take in the headphone jack and the home button connector for the hotly awaited devices			0
there was a public outcry when it was revealed that the next @entity5 would get a new docking port connector			0
the newer , slimline port means that thousands of current @entity10 accessories will need a potentially clunky adapter to work with the ' @entity5 ' - or their devices will become unusable			2
leaks from the website @entity85 , which has strong sources ' close to @entity10 ' , earlier this month suggested the entire next generation of @entity90 , including the @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity54 and future versions of the @entity44 , will use the new port			1
the site believes a special connector will be released to connect older accessories - such as docking stations and speakers - to newer versions of the range			0
the ' @entity103 ' slot , containing the sim card which connects a phone to the carrier network , has also been redesigned to be thinner , although this will be unlikely to cause much disruption to users as networks will provide replacements sims if necessary			0
popular : but @entity5 users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device obsolete : the @entity116 speaker , left , and the @entity117 10 , right , are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the @entity5			0

phone repair website leaks images which appear to confirm four - inch screen for movie and *tv* *playback*
@entity10 expected to unveil phone on september 12th , followed by @entity38 launch in early october
