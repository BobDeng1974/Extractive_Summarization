the @entity3 magazine at the centre of the topless pictures scandal has ‘ more intimate ’ photographs of the @entity7 and @entity8 , its editor boasted last night			1
@entity9 remained defiantly unapologetic over her decision to publish the first set of photos in the @entity3 version of @entity2			1
she said the widespread outrage over the pictures was ‘ disproportionate ’ and tried to insist the shots were ‘ not degrading ’			1
meanwhile , the role of owner @entity24 ( right ) remains unclear grotesque : the magazine put three naked photos of the @entity8 on the front cover with a smile on her face she even said prince @entity31 would feel ‘ less alone ’ as she compared the photos of a topless @entity8 to those taken of him cavorting naked in his @entity35 hotel room last month			1
and in comments which will further distress the @entity8 , she said : ‘ i wo n’t hide the fact that there are more intimate pictures that exist			1
’ the @entity3 edition of @entity2 is owned by @entity42 media group @entity41 , the chairman of which is @entity24 , daughter of @entity42 ’s former prime minister @entity44			1
last night it remained unclear what influence , if any , miss @entity24 had on the decision to publish the graphic photographs			1
what is certain is that both women will face an avalanche of criticism for what @entity53 and @entity8 called a ‘ grotesque and totally unjustifiable ’ invasion of privacy			1
strained : the royal couple looked strained as they left the @entity58 while on a visit shortly after the photos were published			1
both @entity8 and @entity53 are said to be furious about the publication of the pictures instead of showing remorse at the pain felt by the royal couple , ms @entity63 gave numerous interviews to tv networks in a shameless attempt to justify her decision and sell more copies of her magazine			1
she also posted a series of titillating messages on @entity75 saying readers could expect the ‘ hot @entity78 version of the crown jewels ’			2
she added that readers would get the chance to ‘ discover very sensual shots of @entity8 and her husband @entity53 ’			2
‘ what we saw in the pictures was a young couple who are just married , who are in love , who are beautiful , ’ the editor said			1
‘ she is the princess of the 21st century			2
‘ they are a young couple in love			2
she is a young woman who ’s topless , just like the ones who can be seen on all of the beaches of @entity97 and the world			2
these are pictures that are full of joy			2
the pictures are not degrading			2
’ preview : the topless pictures were muzzed out on the @entity3 version of @entity2 's website billed as a ' @entity107 in an attempt to justify the intrusion of privacy ms @entity63 said the @entity7 and @entity8 were ‘ on a terrace of a chateau in the south of @entity97 which is not far from a road on which cars pass without any problems ’			2
‘ they are visible from the street , ’ she added			0
‘ it ’s a nice series which we have a worldwide exclusive on at the moment			0
these are pictures that will go around the world			0
‘ and honestly i do n’t know of a single celebrity magazine in the world that would not have published these if they had them			0
they would n’t have hesitated two seconds before running			0
one should n’t be hypocritical			0
’ the editor tried to downplay the furore by claiming that topless pictures of a princess were ‘ not really new ’			1
@entity133 near @entity134 , @entity78 , @entity97 , where the young royal couple were relaxing invasion of privacy : the @entity137 by ( bottom left ) on the opposing valley slope is where is where it is believed the pictures were shot with a long zoom camera in reality , the couple ’s balcony was about 1,000 yards from the road and the couple would not have been visible without the most sophisticated telescopic lenses			0
the @entity3 version of @entity2 magazine was launched in june 2005 as a sister title to the @entity155 edition , which is published by @entity156			0
it was sold in august 2006 to @entity158 , a subsidiary of the @entity42 company , and now sells around 400,000 copies a week			0
@entity3 closer insisted there had been no breach of safety or security in obtaining the photos			1
one source at the magazine said : ‘ if two public figures chose to strip off in full view of a public road then they can expect to be pictured , and they were			0
’ soldiering on : the young @entity173 had been told about the magazine 's plans to publish the pictures just before their first ever visit to a mosque earlier in the day last night a spokesman for @entity41 declined to comment			1
@entity156 said it had ‘ complained in the strongest terms ’ to @entity41 about the pictures			0
chief executive @entity181 said his company deplored the publication of the ‘ intrusive and offensive pictures ’			0
he said : ‘ @entity156 and closer @entity155 regards publication of these photographs as a gross intrusion of their @entity190 ’ privacy			0
‘ we have absolutely no control over the editorial decisions of @entity194			0
’ video : watch the interview here ...			0

remains unclear if @entity24 influenced decision to publish photos
