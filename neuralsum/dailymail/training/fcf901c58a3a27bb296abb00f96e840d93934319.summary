hospital patients are so confused by @entity3 complaints procedures that many do not bother to speak out at all , a report warns today			0
thousands are put off lodging a formal grievance by baffling systems or concerns that their gripes will lead to reprisals against a loved one , say watchdogs			0
a review by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) also pointed to poor complaint handling , slow investigations and patients not being taken seriously as key areas of concern in hospitals			1
but it is also worried about ‘ very few ’ complaints over adult social care and primary care , which could indicate the lack of an open culture in which concerns are welcomed			1
professor sir @entity37 , chief inspector of hospitals at the @entity16 , said : ‘ a service that is safe , responsive and well - led will treat every concern as an opportunity to improve , will encourage its staff to raise concerns without fear of reprisal , and will respond to complaints openly and honestly			2
‘ unfortunately this is not happening everywhere			0
while most providers have complaints systems in place , people ’s experiences of these are not consistently good			0
‘ we know from the thousands of people who contact the @entity16 every year that many people do not even get as far as making a complaint as they are put off by the confusing system or worried about the impact that complaining might have on their or their loved one ’s care			1
‘ more needs to be done to encourage an open culture where concerns are welcomed and learned from			2
’ the @entity16 received more than 18,000 complaints about poor care last year – 50 a day – while written complaints about the @entity3 to the @entity67 topped 75,000			1
@entity68 recently estimated that 250,000 incidents went unreported last year because people felt unable to complain for various reasons			0
warning : health secretary @entity72 said : ‘ one of the biggest lessons of the tragedy at @entity76 is the need to listen and act on all complaints the @entity79 last month found half of complaints were not handled well and warned the culture of secrecy in the @entity3 has barely changed since the @entity85 hospital scandal , in which hundreds of patients died due to neglect			2
health secretary @entity72 said : ‘ one of the biggest lessons of the tragedy at @entity76 is the need to listen and act on all complaints			0
‘ so as part of our drive to confront poor care we ’re making sure people know how to complain and transforming complaints handling – now a crucial part of the @entity16 ’s tough , independent inspection regime			1
’ terrible experience : @entity102 mp @entity101 broke down in the @entity103 as she described how her husband died in hospital ‘ like a battery hen ’ the @entity16 ’s inspection teams are now being told to take complaints handling into account during inspections in @entity68			1
