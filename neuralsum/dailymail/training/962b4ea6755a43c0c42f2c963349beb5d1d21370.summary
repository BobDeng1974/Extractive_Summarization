though they could prove a nightmare for more irritable employees , these images show the ingenuity of the mischievous colleagues who left a surprise for their beloved co-workers			1
one set of pranksters appear to have forced an entire keyboard through the desk , while another constructed a festive @entity23 's grotto as a sign of @entity26 - time goodwill			1
the nervous employee who had a headstone surreptitiously installed in their office will also have to hope it is n't a macabre hint from their hr department			2
it comes a soon after an office prank took a particularly unfortunate turn , when ' @entity39 ' broker @entity38 , 44 , was crept up on by colleagues at brokers @entity41			2
the workers shouted ' bang ! ' behind , a reference to a horrific incident last month when he was shot in the leg by masked assailants			0
the shock caused him to fall over and re-open the wound in his leg			0

mischievous co-workers left surprises for their colleagues , *including* leaving a keyboard and mouse to set in jelly
