with motorists and cyclists battling for space on @entity5 ’s congested roads , a company is proposing a £ 600m ‘ floating cycleway ’ that would take thousands of cyclists of the streets and put them on the @entity9			1
proposed by the @entity11 , the @entity10 would serve as a nearly eight - mile cycling route from @entity13 to @entity14			1
the first composite image released by the organisation , founded by artist @entity17 and architect @entity18 , shows the costly path skirting the south bank in front of @entity22 and slipping past @entity23			2
without any vehicular traffic to impede them , fit cyclists could pedal the entire length in about 30 minutes			1
the mid-point would be the @entity40			0
share the road : @entity10 users would be charged £ 1.50 per journey to cover upkeep costs halfway there : @entity40 would be the mid-point of the path through central @entity5 users would be charged £ 1.50 per journey to cover upkeep costs , while the path ’s lights and refreshment kiosks would be powered using solar , tide and wind energy			1
with its unique proposal , @entity11 is challenging city planners to think outside the box to reduce congestion and pollution while encouraging more people to cycle			2
the group is raising money to conduct a feasibility study which will identify how many on - and off - ramps would be required and how it would avoid moorings			0
it plans to seek private investors if the project proceeds			0
this image shows a proposed segregated two - way cycle track included in @entity5 's ‘ @entity75 for bikes ’ plan this is what the proposed segregated two - way cycle track would look like on @entity80 but the plan faces hurdles because of its nine - figure price tag and planning requirements			0
in its proposal , @entity11 said the path would complement the ‘ @entity75 for bikes ’ plan unveiled by mayor @entity89 last month			1
under that proposal , two new urban cycleways – an 18 - mile east - west route from @entity92 to @entity93 , and a three - mile north - south route from @entity95 to @entity96 – would link to other routes at a cost £ 47m			2
scheduled to open in march 2016 , both cycleways would be almost entirely separated from vehicles			0
@entity5 is planning to construct two new urban cycleways that would link to other routes at a cost £ 47m			0

@entity10 cycling route would be nearly eight miles in length
users would be charged £ 1.50 per journey to cover maintenance costs
fit cyclists could pedal the entire length in about 30 minutes
@entity11 says path could be constructed in two years
