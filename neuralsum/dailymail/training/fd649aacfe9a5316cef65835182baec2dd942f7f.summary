by @entity0 and @entity1 time is running out to persuade the public of the benefits of fracking , @entity2 was warned last night			1
as mps complained that plans to incentivise communities with a share of the profits of shale gas ‘ do not go far enough ’ , the prime minister yesterday pledged that @entity14 would go ‘ all out ’ for shale gas			1
but in a stark warning , every mp in @entity17 and council leaders in the @entity19 have written a joint letter to warn mr @entity2 that ‘ opposition is hardening ’ to fracking			1
and they warn mr @entity2 he will be throwing away a ‘ once - in - a - generation opportunity ’ to close the @entity45 unless he acts now			0
crucially , the letter has also been signed by five council leaders , who are in charge of deciding whether to allow fracking in their areas			1
plans outlined by the prime minister yesterday mean local councils can pocket 100 per cent of the business rates collected from fracking firms – double the previous amount – plus £ 100,000 for every well drilled			1
protections will ensure fracking will only go ahead if environmental dangers can be avoided , mr @entity2 said demonstrators block the entrance to an @entity63 shale drilling plant oil depot near @entity28 , @entity29 during mr @entity2 's visit but local communities will get only 1 per cent of the total profits from shale gas exploration – compared with the 10 per cent demanded by the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) , while the government will pocket 62 per cent in taxes			1
mr @entity2 , who yesterday toured a drilling site near @entity28 , @entity17 , said : ‘ we ’re going all out for shale			0

i want us to get on board			0
’ but sir @entity83 , chairman of the @entity68 , dismissed the proposed community contributions as a ‘ token offer ’			2
he said : ‘ this is not happening in the @entity87			0
this is happening in and around local people and local communities , and they have got to get their fair share			2
’ but @entity92 , of @entity93 , said : ‘ this is a naked attempt by the government to bribe hard - pressed councils into accepting fracking in their area			2
’ meanwhile , protests continued last night at the site of a shale gas well near @entity103			0
for nearly two months , campaigners have tried to stop drilling at @entity106 , where an exploratory well is being sunk beside the @entity109			0
yesterday six campaigners were arrested for obstruction , bringing the total number of arrests to more than 50			0
