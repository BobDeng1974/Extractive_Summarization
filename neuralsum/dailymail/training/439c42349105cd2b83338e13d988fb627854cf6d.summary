by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 10 april 2013 barely a week passes without a celebrity showing off a new tattoo			2
inked stars such as the @entity5 boys , @entity6 and @entity7 are idolised by their fans , who often rush to copy their heroes			0
but now a renowned celebrity tattoo artist , who has created some of the tattoos on @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 has spoken out about the terrifying dark side to this body art trend			1
@entity18 has launched a campaign , ‘ @entity28 ’ , to introduce regulations on the tattoo industry after hearing too many horror stories of work going wrong or becoming infected because it was done by unqualified tattooists with kits that are easily available for anyone to purchase online			1
tattoos done by totally untrained artists or by those who have bought a kit online , can result in poor tattoos and dangerous infections @entity18 asked people to send in their pictures of badly done tattoos as part of the campaign and was inundated with responses even if unprofessional body art does n't become infected , the results are often a long way from the desired result , with poor colouring ( left ) and bad drawing ( right ) commonly seen currently there are very limited regulations on the industry			1
there are no qualifications required and no proof of training or experience is needed to open up a tattoo studio or - even more disturbingly - set up a ' mobile ' business from home			1
in order to open a tattoo parlour all that is required is that the premises must have wipeable surfaces , hot running water and must have an autoclave , easy to pick up online , which is used to sterilise certain equipment			2
' literally anybody can open up a tattoo studio , ' @entity18 told the @entity66			2
‘ this is putting members of the public at risk as there are thousands of people who are untrained and unaware of the necessary health risks involved setting up shops			0
‘ anybody can buy both cheap and professional tattoo equipment off the internet and there is no law to stop or prosecute people doing this			2
‘ @entity5 singer @entity13 is a client of @entity18 , but has also let his untrained friends tattoo him @entity15 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) have both had work done by @entity18 , tweeting from the studio @entity14 is just one of @entity18 's celebrity fans x factor winner @entity15 tweeted his enthusiasm of @entity18 's work @entity18 's celebrity clients have been tweeting about the campaign speaking about the consequences of such equipment being so readily available to anyone , @entity18 , who has been a full time tattooist since 2002 says : ‘ cheap equipment combined with someone who is untrained is a huge risk to people who are unaware of what to look for when getting a tattoo			1
‘ people who are untrained in tattooing are unaware of the infections and diseases that can be caused by using cheap and unsterile equipment			0
‘ permanent scarring to the skin can be caused if the tattoo is not done correctly and bloodborne diseases such as @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 can be spread			2
’ @entity18 is hopeful that his celebrity influence means that the campaign to introduce more regulation into the industry will be successful , and he has launched a huge media and social campaign to spread the message about the dangers of unprofessional tattoos			1
he will appear on @entity120 later this week and is to visit the @entity121 of @entity122 to discuss legislation with mps			0
the movement 's facebook page ‘ @entity28 ’ , is filled with pictures of body art that has gone wrong to illustrate the prevalence of the problem			0
a simple search on @entity132 reveals huge number of kits , including ' starter kits ' available to buy for as little as £ 20 , with no restrictions @entity18 says : ‘ members of the public assume that a tattoo studio is going to be run by professionals as it has been allowed to be opened , but the problem is that the council will currently allow anyone to open up a studio			1
‘ there needs to be a certain level of training required to open up a studio , preferably at least two years , and also a basic level of knowledge about tattooing and how to be safe and sterile , possibly a test needs to be taken and a certificate awarded when passed to prove this			0
‘ and not all of these people are opening studios , the majority of them are working from their homes where it is even harder to keep hygienic and sterile			0
the council are actually licensing these people to work from their homes which is outrageous , but only a small number of them even bother obtaining a license to carry out their work			0
@entity18 say the worry is that people just do n’t realise they may be putting their health , not to mention their appearance at risk by visiting some tattoo parlours , or going to ‘ artists ’ homes ‘ due to these people working from home , the number of underage kids getting tattooed has increased massively			1
we have contacted many schools which are aware of this but take no further action against it			0
‘ this needs to be stopped and changed to ensure the safety of the general public and to make tattooing a much safer business			2
we need to make people aware of what to look for when getting a tattoo			0
until the regulation of the industry is in place , @entity18 has some advice for anyone thinking of getting ‘ inked : ‘ people need to go into these studios and ask to see portfolios of healed work that has been done there before even considering getting tattooed by them			1
going off of a recommendation is another good way of finding a decent tattooist			0
' currently there is no qualification required and there is no proof of training , experience or knowledge about tattooing needed to open a parlour or buy kits online @entity18 is visiting the @entity213 to petition to have regulations put in place to make the tattoo industry safer visit the @entity28 2013 campaign 's @entity218 page here			1
