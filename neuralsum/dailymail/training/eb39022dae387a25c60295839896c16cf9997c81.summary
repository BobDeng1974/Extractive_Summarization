87.3 per cent of families have at least one person earning in work , the highest since records began almost two decades ago compared to 2008 , the biggest rise has been among lone parent families finding work , the @entity19 said the government insists that efforts to tackle so - called troubled families , where no - one works , have helped to tackle long - term unemployment			1
the @entity19 found that 87.3 per cent of families were classified as working families , the highest since comparable records began in 1996			1
the biggest increase was among lone parent families with dependent children up from 57.4 per cent in 1996 to 71.1 per cent this year			2
in the 2million workless families , more than half ( 53.8 per cent ) have had no one in work for three or more years			1

work and pensions secretary @entity63 said the government 's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to work			0
he said : ' the benefits system this government inherited was broken , often trapping the very people it was designed to help in cycles of worklessness and welfare dependency			0
' we are reforming the system so that people are given the skills as well as the opportunities to get into work , with @entity80 meaning that they can take employment safe in the knowledge that they will be better off than they would be on benefits			0
' and our reforms are clearly working - with figures released today confirming that the proportion of families where no - one works is now at an all - time low			0
furthermore , lone parent families have seen the biggest increases in employment rates and lone mothers now have the highest employment rate on record			2
