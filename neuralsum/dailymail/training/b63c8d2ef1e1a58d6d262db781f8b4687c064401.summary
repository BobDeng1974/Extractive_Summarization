breath - holding , shallow breathing and hyperventilating can all trigger something called the sympathetic nervous system ( @entity33 )			0
when activated , the @entity33 – among other things - can cause pupils to dilate , increases heart palpitations , enables opens up blood vessels in the face and can lead to restless legs and excessive sweating			1
it also helps in feeling sensations like cold , heat , and pain			0
its job is to protect the body when it ’s facing physical danger			1
during an episode , lack of oxygen causes a sufferer to come out of deep sleep and into a lighter state of sleep , or a brief period of wakefulness , to restore normal breathing			0
symptoms of the condition include tiredness , waking up with a sore or dry throat , poor memory and concentration , headaches , irritability , anxiety , depression , low libido and impotence			0

ms @entity87 offers some advice to deal with email apnoea , including monitoring breathing , trying to become better aware of anxious feelings and even using a heart - rate monitor			1
