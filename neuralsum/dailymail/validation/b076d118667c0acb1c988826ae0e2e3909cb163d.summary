it was a foregone conclusion that @entity1 would use this year 's @entity2 to launch its latest handset , but the @entity5 firm had something else up its sleeve			1
at the event in @entity10 the phone maker unveiled early details about a full - body virtual reality system it has developed in partnership with gaming giant @entity15			1
the system , dubbed @entity17 , moves beyond just a headset and uses @entity20 - style lasers to track even the smallest of body movements , letting players become fully immersed in their games			1
at @entity1 unveiled early details of a full - body virtual reality system developed in partnership with gaming giant @entity15			1
the system moves beyond a headset ( pictured ) and uses @entity20 - style lasers to track the smallest of body movements , letting players become fully immersed in game @entity20 is a system designed by @entity32 for use with its @entity35 games consoles			1
the technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its ' small object detection ' is said to be two - and - a - half times better			2
this means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller , for example			1
@entity1 ’s @entity46 has ‘ full room scale ’ and two wireless controllers with hand tracking			1
a developer version will launch in the spring and the consumer model will go on sale later in the year			1
the system is powered by the @entity55 technology and @entity1 will announce more information nearer the time of the developer launch			1
@entity1 also used the event to unveil its 5 - inch @entity62 @entity61 phone with @entity64 camera and a fitness band , in partnership with @entity67			1
in particular , the @entity71 's rear - facing 4 @entity69 camera has been added to the front of the @entity61 , and the @entity61 's rear camera has been upgraded to @entity64			2
@entity20 is a system designed by @entity32 for use with its @entity35 games consoles.the technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its ' small object detection ' is said to be two - and - a - half times @entity80 means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller , for example ( pictured ) ultrapixels are , for all intents and purposes , another name for megapixels			1
however , each individual pixel is marginally larger meaning they capture more light			0
in addition to the upgraded lenses , @entity1 has developed software called @entity95 designed around the human eye			1
when a photo is taken on the one @entity61 , this algorithm makes it appear as close to how the human eye would view it as possible , with the same light adjustment and focus			0
it also adds similar depth qualities , boosted by the dual camera the firm originally added on the @entity71			0
' i have previously struggled to buy into virtual reality when it consisted of sitting on a chair and simply looking around , but @entity1 ’s vive system has convinced me otherwise			1
during the demonstration i was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup , the @entity115 headset , two controllers and sensors on two of the walls			1
these sensors use lasers to plot the room ’s shape , size and obstacles			1
for the demonstration version , the headset was attached to the computer using wires			2
but the @entity1 spokesman told @entity130 this was because of the interference from the various networks covering the trade show and the final version will be wireless			1
during a demonstration @entity130 's @entity136 was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup , the @entity140 ( pictured ) , two controllers and sensors on two of the walls			1
these sensors use lasers to plot the room ’s shape , size and obstacles once i put the headset on , a grid appeared around me similar to how the holodeck appears in @entity154			1
the demonstrator handed me the wireless controllers , which in itself was a strange experience to see controllers ‘ floating ’ towards you but not see the hands holding them			2
i was then trained to use the controllers by blowing up a balloon with the left hand and punching it through the air with the right			1
the first ‘ experience ’ dropped me underwater onto a sunken ship			0
small fish swam around me , which i could ‘ touch ’ and move			0
i could look over the edge of the ship and explore the deck			0
if at any point i approached a real - world obstacle , a feint grid would appear to warn me			2
during this experience a virtual stingray swam near my face and a huge whale made me jump as it appeared on my left shoulder and cast a shadow over me			2
another experience involved painting in the air			0
colours and brushes were selected with the left controller and painted with the right			0
these paintings hung in the air and i was able to walk through them			0
i also made snow fall around me			0
a third involved exploring a kitchen , making a meal and serving it			0
at one point i dropped an egg near my foot and it broke and made a mess			0
i could use the controllers and triggers to pick up objects , move them around and drop them			2
these skills were then put to the test during another experience in which i had to repair a robot			0
while the final experience had me placed in the middle of a virtual battle			2
i could explore the battleground and kneel down so my face was in line with the ground			0
i could n't count the number of times i jumped , laughed , expressed surprise and was wowed by this technology			0
and this is an early version , with a limited number of trials			2
by these standards , this technology has the potential to live up to @entity1 ’s claims of being revolutionary			1
that said , there is one substantial benefit to having a stationary virtual reality experience compared to one you can explore and that ’s convenience			1
i ca n’t imagine many people have rooms they can dedicate entirely to this technology , or want to spend money on a host of kit , rather than just a headset			0
as it stands though this technology literally took my breath away at times and was the stand out tech of this year ’s @entity2			1
' @entity136 the ' full - body virtual reality system ' was a surprise announcement at an event where @entity1 also unveiled it @entity61 handset and a fitness band			1
the @entity61 has added incremental changes compared to previous @entity71 ( pictured ) and these include taking the 4 @entity69 camera from rear of @entity71 and adding it to the front of the @entity61 handset : @entity1 has also unveiled its 5 - inch @entity62 @entity61 phone with @entity64 camera and a fitness band beside this , however , the changes between the @entity71 and @entity61 are incremental with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system			1
these include highly customisable themes and dynamic home screens			0
using the phone 's location , and by learning about a user 's habits , the @entity61 will change which icons appear on the home screen throughout the day			0
for example , if it knows the user is at home it will prioritise gaming and social network apps , but when it senses the user is near a tube or train station it will push the @entity287 app - or similar - to the front			2
it only suggests apps that the user has already installed , and the suggestions can be customised or switched off completely			0
elsewhere , the @entity61 is powered by the latest @entity294 technology and features @entity295 of @entity296			0
it has @entity298 of storage with the option to extend this using an sd card , plus all customers get @entity304 for two years			0
@entity130 's @entity136 reveals her first impressions of @entity1 's new device			1
' there is little to get excited about with the one m9			0
' its predecessors - the original one known as @entity311 and the one @entity71 - are well - made , well - built and were global successes			2
' and the @entity61 is more of the same			0
' this means it has the same great design and feels comfortable to hold - so is far from a criticism - but it hardly warrants spending money to upgrade , especially from the @entity71			1
' the standout feature of the @entity61 is its cameras			0
' @entity1 leads the way with smartphone cameras and has tapped into the growing trend of ' smartphone photography '			1
' by adding the @entity326 camera from the @entity71 to the front of the @entity61 , it also understands its customers love of selfies			0
' seeing the @entity95 in action does highlight how shots on @entity332 and @entity334 devices can sometimes fall short , but again , this is n't a reason to upgrade on its own			2
' beyond that the innovations are minimal			0
' @entity1 prides itself on including features that add value rather than gimmicks , but without these there seems little incentive to switch - especially if you 're a @entity344 or @entity345 owner			1
' many of its software features , such as @entity348 and the new dynamic homescreen , will appeal to hardcore @entity1 fans , but may seem like bloatware to others			1
' that 's not to say the phone is poor , and if an @entity311 owner is looking to upgrade then the @entity61 seems like an obvious choice			0
' but by tapping into its existing market rather than looking to expand , the handset may struggle to emulate its predecessors successes			0
' the phone will be available from 31 march in three colours - ' gold on silver ' , ' gum metal grey on grey ' and ' gold on gold			2
' prices are yet to be announced			0
@entity1 also used the event to launch its first fitness band in partnership with @entity67			1
the partnership was announced in january and under @entity374 ’s team of designers , sports scientists and athletes have worked with @entity1 ’s @entity378 to create the wearable			1
it will work with @entity380 - an app that lets people record and analyse their activity levels from various other apps such as @entity385 and @entity386			2
the band pairs with @entity334 4.3 + and @entity389 7 + to also show phone notifications			0
it will additionally respond to gestures to make it easier to control when exercising , for example			0
@entity1 said the band launch in the @entity394 later this year and the company is ' evaluating ' it in @entity396			1
again , no price details were given			0
the @entity61 's rear camera has been upgraded to @entity64			0
in addition to the new lenses , @entity1 has developed software called @entity95 designed to mimic the human eye			1
when a photo is taken this algorithm adjusts exposure , focus and depth accordingly			0
this is boosted by the dual - lens setup added on the @entity71 ( shown ) beside the camera updates , the differences between the @entity71 and @entity61 are incremental , with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system			2
many of the leaked specifications ( pictured ) before the event have been confirmed including @entity295 of @entity296 , screen size , operating system and processor			2

the devices were unveiled at @entity2 in @entity10
full - body virtual reality system uses lasers to track smallest of movements
this means players will be able to become fully immersed in their games
@entity1 ’s @entity46 has ' full room scale ' and two controllers with hand tracking
