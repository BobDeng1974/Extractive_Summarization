@entity0 has hailed @entity2 's impact on @entity4 's squad and described his signing as a ' gift from the footballing gods '			1
@entity2 's influences on @entity4 's team has been growing with each week and he was outstanding in last sunday 's 3 - 1 win at @entity11 , scoring twice and coming within the width of a post of collecting the match ball			1
@entity0 moved late to sign the @entity15 in the final days of the transfer window , taking the chance to recruit him as a free agent after @entity19 opted to pursue a £ 16million deal for @entity21 instead			1
' nothing changes from our point of view in terms of how we will use him , ' said @entity0			1
' having @entity2 here is like a gift from the footballing gods for us			1
he is the perfect ingredient for our young players , a phenomenal example			2
' the way he has been working to get his fitness is pristine			2
he is a player of the highest , highest calibre			2
to see his performance on sunday – and every role he has played so far – has been so exciting and his knowhow has been very important , particularly in @entity56 games			2
' but the way he took his finishes at @entity11 was like the old days			1
i hope he can enjoy his football here and we are working hard to make that happen			2
i think he is enjoying it and that is very important			0
@entity2 is a phenomenal example for @entity4 's youngsters , including @entity68 ( left ) , according to @entity0 @entity2 worked his socks off in @entity4 ’s win at @entity71			1
far from his more familiar role as a target man , he played as an attacking midfielder in support of @entity76			0
though playing down the left , he moved across the width of the pitch , as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows ( below )			0
and he put in a shift in his own box for corners too			0
not too shabby for a 33 - year - old			0
' he has that stimulation to win things			0
he comes in every day with the highest standards and he wants more work			0
i think @entity4 can give him an important chapter in his career			1
' @entity2 could retain his place on saturday when @entity4 seek their third consecutive win in the @entity97 against @entity98 , the club with whom @entity0 started his managerial career			1
he expects @entity76 , who suffered what @entity0 called ' a couple of heavy knocks ' at @entity71 last sunday , to be in contention and @entity0 is thrilled with the attacking options @entity4 have			1
@entity0 is thrilled with his attacking options and @entity2 could retain his place for the visit of @entity98 ' we started the season well in terms of our attacking play , ' said @entity0			1
' we have been able to score in every game and there have been eight different scores so far			0
the goals we scored against @entity116 showed we have the potential to hurt anyone			1
' we were a bit soft at the back early on and conceded some goals that affected results			0
@entity123 is getting stronger game by game and we are very happy with the squad			0
i just want them to be in the best physical shape for the second half of the season			0
' but we are a lot tighter now , we have had back - to - back wins and it has been good to enjoy good performances in @entity136			0
we have now got a massive game against @entity98 and we will have to play as we did against @entity138 to get anything			2
