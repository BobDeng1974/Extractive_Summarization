by @entity0 for @entity1 if winning is a habit , it ’s one that @entity5 would like to reacquire with some haste			1
if few are yet willing to entertain the notion of @entity14 ’s men doing anything other than romping to this season ’s @entity12 title , they are n’t doing much cavorting at the moment			1
at @entity16 , they certainly played their part in a hugely entertaining 1 - 1 draw			1
yet the fact that @entity21 ’s home side were at least equally responsible for the thrills on a sunny afternoon said a great deal about @entity5 ’ s current state of readiness			1
when @entity14 admits , as he did yesterday , that his team looked ‘ afraid ’ in a game against newly - promoted opposition , something is n’t right			0
the @entity5 boss insists that all will be better after the international break – and after the ins and outs of a transfer window are completed			2
they ’ll need to be			0
equaliser : @entity38 came off the bench to score and earn @entity5 a point against @entity41 on @entity44 , a @entity43 header almost exactly one minute into this early kick - off was cancelled out when substitute @entity38 scored against one of his many former clubs not long after half - time			1
over 90 minutes plus added time of cut and thrust , to and fro , give and go – not to mention some slap and tickle among a @entity5 defence missing their star player , more of whom elsewhere and later , ad infinitum – both teams had their chances to win			2
each settled rather uneasily for a point at the end of a day when off - field events often intruded on the thoughts of spectators			0
the curse of the closing days of any transfer window is that every aspect of team selection , every tiny gesture , is magnified and analysed to the nth degree			0
often with good reason ; most of us are long enough in the tooth to read the runes at this time of year			0
@entity74 being left out , then , was obvious			0
we knew he wanted to leave @entity5 , we were aware of interest from several @entity77 teams – and we knew that @entity5 were n’t for turning on this issue			2
opener : @entity43 headed in a @entity81 corner to put the hosts in front @entity84 being recalled , meanwhile , could be interpreted as the manager looking to rebuild some goodwill with a player whose agent is arriving in @entity89 for contract talks tomorrow			1
pick your way through that one			0
as for @entity38 coming off the bench for the ineffectual @entity94 – hooked before half - time – to score and perform as well as any in @entity96 ? that ’ll be the end of any silly talk about him being loaned out to @entity101			1
@entity5 need all the livewires they can get at the moment			2
in a first half typified by @entity5 sluggishness and @entity41 ’s vigour , the visitors were constantly troubled down their left flank			1
partly because @entity109 could n’t cope with @entity41 winger @entity110 , making his league debut for the club – and partly because @entity5 counterpart @entity94 gave his full - back about as much protection as a paper mache tank			1
@entity94 was an empty jersey here , offering nothing in attack and less than zero in defence			0
on a day when @entity5 could not afford to be carrying any passengers , it was a minor miracle that the @entity122 made it to 40 minutes before @entity14 replaced him with @entity38			1
by that point @entity41 were sitting fairly comfortably on a 1 - 0 lead , having started at a pace that clearly caught @entity5 cold			1
it began inside the opening minute , @entity81 leaving impressive : @entity41 are currently sixth in the table , level on points with @entity5 @entity109 for dead and forcing @entity133 into a last - ditch tackle at the expense of a corner			1
an early tester from a set piece , then			0
it was a test that @entity5 failed			2
or , rather , one passed easily by @entity41 , as a @entity81 delivery was met by the forehead of a soaring @entity143 , the bounce of his downward header beating @entity147 on the post			2
@entity5 rallied to create a couple of near things but , with @entity151 always lively for the home side , @entity41 looked as likely to score as the reigning champions			1
especially when @entity81 got on the ball			0
the former @entity157 winger ’s best moment came as he was being castigated for a perceived lack of go - forward by failing to show down the line for a breaking @entity161			0
in reality , he was just biding his time , holding back to create the five or six yards needed to explode past @entity109 , beat @entity133 and fire in a low shot tipped on to the post by @entity167			0
the introduction of @entity38 helped @entity5 greatly , while central defender @entity169 replacing @entity170 at half - time – forcing @entity172 out to right back – also gave them more ability to carry the ball out from the back			1
captain : @entity84 ' @entity5 future is uncertain with a number of @entity180 clubs interested when the equaliser came , with 54 minutes on the clock , no - one inside @entity16 would have been surprised by the identity of the scorer			1
they know ‘ @entity186 in these parts			0
remember him with a certain fondness			0
taking the ball into feet on the edge of the box , the striker turned and hit a sweet low shot with his left foot , a deflection off the helpless @entity197 helping the ball to fizz and spin beyond the reach of a despairing @entity201 and in off the post			0
@entity5 were certainly energised by the equaliser , a superb charge from @entity205 ending with @entity206 strangely choosing not to shoot , while a fading @entity81 – eventually replaced – began to struggle with @entity109 ’s forward surges			2
yet @entity41 sub @entity208 , on for @entity81 , could easily have scored from one of three – yes , that ’s three – chances created by his blistering pace against a wandering @entity5 back line			1
on each occasion @entity208 stormed down the inside right channel , exposing gaps and skipping over a despairing @entity133 at one point			0
two of his shots were pulled just off target , the other swatted aside by @entity167 , whose reactions were equal to the powerful thump			0
chances came and went for both teams as this match rattled towards the finish , @entity206 hitting the post and @entity38 forcing @entity201 into a fine save from a 25 - yarder that moved wickedly through the air , while @entity231 twice came close to securing all three points for the hosts			1
it was breathless , occasionally brilliant , quite often barmy			0
not the kind of experience that @entity5 would like to make a habit of .			2

@entity41 and @entity5 draw 1 - 1 in @entity12 match at @entity16
@entity43 headed hosts in front
@entity38 came off the bench to equalise
