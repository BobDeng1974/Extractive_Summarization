thursday is the 11th anniversary of the day their 13 - year - old daughter , @entity4 , was abducted and murdered as she returned from school			1
it would be six months before her body was found in a wood 25 miles away from their home in @entity13 , @entity14			0
a family torn apart : murdered schoolgirl @entity16 , 13 , with her mother @entity18			2
thursday is the 11th anniversary of the day she was abducted and murdered @entity1 and @entity2 in the wake of daughter @entity21 's disappearance			1
it would be six months before her body was found in a wood 25 miles away from their home in @entity13 , @entity14 and it would be longer still , a full nine years , until @entity27 , the former club doorman who killed her , would finally be convicted of her murder			0
but for the @entity2 family even that would bring no closure			0
in july 2011 , less than a fortnight after the trial ended , the @entity34 reported that @entity38 journalists had intercepted and deleted voicemails on @entity4 ’s mobile phone			1
the claim was especially toxic because her parents had thought at the time that it might have been her deleting the messages , giving them false hope that she was still alive			1
for the @entity34 this ‘ false hope moment ’ would prove to be the spark it had been looking for to detonate the phone - hacking scandal			1
such was the scale of public outrage that within days @entity52 had closed down the 168 - year - old sunday tabloid			1
soon afterwards @entity54 , @entity55 ’s chief executive and a former editor of the paper , was forced to resign			0
@entity55 paid the @entity59 £ 2million compensation with @entity52 personally donating an additional £ 1million to charities of their choice			0
but it quickly emerged that the battle centred around @entity4 ’s parents was not just against the newspaper behind the hacking of their daughter ’s phone , but an entire industry			2
riding on the back of public sympathy for their plight , the @entity72 campaign was by now in full cry			2
launched by self - appointed media watchdog the @entity79 , its aim was to force a full - scale public inquiry into hacking and press standards generally			0
to amplify its voice , the celebrity victims of media intrusion were put at the forefront of the campaign – @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
but when it came to putting pressure on the politicians , the involvement of the @entity59 would prove critical			0
@entity95 meets with the family , including @entity1 , mother @entity18 and sister @entity97 , at his office following claims that @entity4 's mobile phone was hacked on behalf of the @entity38 a month after the @entity59 had given evidence at @entity103 , a senior @entity55 executive accused the @entity34 of ' sexing ' up its story about @entity38 journalists deleting messages from @entity16 's phone within a week of the @entity34 story the couple , accompanied by representatives of @entity72 , had met all three party leaders			1
the prime minister then announced the @entity114			0
when it convened in november 2011 , there again were hacked @entity72 ’s roster of celebrity victims , led by @entity89 , by now their cheerleader - in - chief			1
the @entity120 also attended , giving heartbreaking testimony			0
mrs @entity2 recounted the night of march 24 , 2002 , when she rang her daughter ’s mobile phone and found fresh space was available on its previously full voicemail account			0
she shouted to her husband : ‘ she ’s picked up her voicemail , @entity1			0
she ’s alive ! ’ the previously automated response had reverted to @entity4 ’s own greeting			2
the sound of her daughter ’s voice led mrs @entity2 to believe @entity4 had deleted some messages ( something later blamed on the actions of @entity38 journalists )			1
a month after the @entity59 had given evidence at @entity103 , a senior @entity55 executive accused the @entity34 of ‘ sexing ’ up its story about @entity38 journalists deleting messages from @entity16 ’s phone			1
lord @entity103 said the messages were probably deleted automatically by the mobile network operator ‘ the @entity146 has now confirmed that the @entity38 was not to blame for deleting the specific mobile phone messages of @entity16 that gave false hope too her parents that she was alive , ’ he said			1
the @entity34 was forced to print an apology			0
the following may , @entity153 ’s chief inspector @entity152 said in a statement to the @entity114 : ‘ we can not conclusively say whether any voicemails were manually deleted			1
’ and in his report , @entity103 accepted as much , saying the voicemail messages were in fact probably deleted automatically by the mobile network operator			1
‘ the inquiry does conclude on the lower standard of proof of the balance of probabilities that tampering with or illegal interception of @entity16 ’s voicemail was not the cause of the “ false hope moment ” , ’ he wrote			1
yet hacked off and its supporters dismissed the revelation as a minor detail			1
after all they had got their inquiry and the report they wanted			0
all they needed now was to force the political parties to accept the @entity103 recommendations in their entirety – and once again the @entity59 ’ name was key			2
last week it emerged that the campaign group had made extraordinary threats against @entity185 in an attempt to ‘ sabotage ’ cross-party agreement on press reform			1
the group threatened to publish a statement in which victims of phone hacking led by the @entity59 would condemn @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 in the strongest terms for agreeing to a ‘ dirty deal ’			2
concerns about @entity72 ’s motives were heightened yesterday after a secret dossier drawn up by the group was leaked to the @entity203			2
in it there is a discussion of how the @entity59 can be used to pressurise the prime minister			0
it concludes : ‘ it is in their name that we act			0
’ given the events of the past few days , some might argue that @entity72 should remind itself of that final phrase .			2

thursday is 11th anniversary of day 13 - year - old was abducted and murdered
it had been claimed journalists had intercepted and deleted her voicemails
parents said was ‘ false hope moment ’ which made them think she was alive
@entity103 has since said messages were probably deleted by network
but @entity72 pressure group dismissed the revelation as a minor detail
