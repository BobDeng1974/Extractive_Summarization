paying toll charges is an unfortunate reality of life on the road that most drivers just learn to deal with			2
but , as these pictures show , some motorists are so desperate to cling onto their loose change that almost anything is fair game for dodging the collectors - who often ask as little as 26 cents			2
everyday tactics for avoiding number plate - tracking cameras including bending the plate back or trying to change the numbers by smearing on grease			0
sneaky : a motorcyclist reaches back to obscure his numberplate - a dangerous move that will save him between 26 cents and a dollar and a half extreme : this passenger braved leaning out the back of his friend 's car to avoid paying a toll bent back : some drivers take the less eye - catching decision to bend their plates to an angle where they ca n't be read by cameras but truly inventive - or desperate - road users have gone even further , leaning out the trunks of their cars , or even standing on top of them to obscure the plates			1
motorcylists put their balance to the test , either reaching back to put their hand over the registrations plates , or even lifting up their legs and obscuring the letters and digits with their feet			0
new examples of the sneaky tricks were brought to light by an @entity51 investigation into the ongoing problem in southern @entity53			1
an accident ? duct tape and innocent - looking smears have also been employed as means of getting out of charges not recommended : in the most extreme example pictures , a man clings to the top of a car and obscures the plates with his legs dirty trick : another driver obscured his registration with semi-opaque plastic - while artfully - placed grease turned two zeroes into figures of 8 according to @entity72 , the organization which operates tolling in the area , the company loses out on $ 36million every year because of drivers who skip the charges			1
@entity51 reporters rode along with @entity53 's highway patrol as they tried to crack down on the problem - though apparent offenders were reluctant to explain themselves			0
according to officers , truck drivers are the most frequent offenders , as they pass the toll plazas several times per day and can expect their bills to reach hundreds of dollars a month			2
getting caught out dodging a toll can mean a fine of at least $ 135 , and repeated offences can lose motorists their license			0
but the threat seems to do little to deter the hundreds of drivers , finding ever - more - inventive ways to beat the system			0
careful : one motorcyclist leans as far forward as he can and wraps his legs around the vehicle to dodge the fare toe - tally shameless : this driver uses his foot to contribute to southern @entity53 's $ 36million toll - dodging problem cover - up : a simple sheet of paper or plastic makes this driver impossible to scope out at night			1

investigation in southern @entity53 showed road users going to extremes
some lean back on *motorbikes* , others cling to the backs of cars

tactic allows drivers to get through toll plazas without paying up
