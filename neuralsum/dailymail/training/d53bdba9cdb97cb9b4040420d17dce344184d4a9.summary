if you constantly hit the snooze button each morning to avoid getting out of bed , a new app might make waking for work a lot easier - or at least more interesting			2
instead of playing a generic tune or ringtone , the free @entity7 app lets random members call each other at set times			2
the app has members from around the world , and each call only lasts a minute - to make sure there are no ' awkward conversations or goodbyes '			2
@entity7 ( pictured ) was created @entity21 developer @entity20			1
to use @entity7 , an alarm is set via the app for 7am for example , and at 7am , the user who set the alarm will receive a phone call from another member			1
this member can be from anywhere in the world @entity7 was created @entity21 developer @entity20			1
to use @entity7 , an alarm is set via the app for 7am for example , and at 7am , the user who set the alarm will receive a phone call from another member			1
this member can be from anywhere in the world			2
each call lasts just 60 seconds , and users will hear a warning at 50 seconds , before the call is automatically cut off			1
user can also choose to wake someone else up , and the free app does not reveal phone numbers			2
each call is carried out over the internet , which means if a user is connected to @entity52 or a mobile network , they wo n’t be charged for the call			2
however , on a mobile network , the call will use data , and if the user has used more than their data limit , they may incur a fee			0
it was created by @entity21 developer @entity20 who states on the app 's website : ' wakie is a fun , friendly community of people			1
' it ’s a brand new way to wake up , made especially for those of us who hate the jarring noise of an alarm clock			0
‘ when you use @entity7 , you get to start your day with a smile instead of a frown ! ’ wakie is available on @entity76 and @entity77 , and is due to launch in the @entity78 soon			0
