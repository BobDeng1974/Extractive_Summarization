it ’s a really cool team , too , one of my favourites to have been on			0
’ other talented upstarts , such as sprinters @entity83 and @entity104 , have got their first taste of victory on the main stage , a point from which to push towards the @entity110 next year and the @entity111 in 2016			2
@entity22 , though , remains the most likely gold - medal prospect on the world stage			1
he might not be at his best but , in the watery afternoon sunshine at the @entity116 , he achieved what no athlete has before — a triple - double of @entity120 , world and @entity123 5k and 10k titles			1

’ @entity22 has spoken recently of feeling vulnerable on the start line			1
he has collapsed twice this year — once at the end of the @entity156 half - marathon and once again after a training run in @entity158 , @entity159 , which he said reminded him of the fragility of his career			1
but if he was feeling nervous , his rivals appeared petrified by his presence yesterday			0
they knew they were up against a runner who is a class apart			0

only @entity181 @entity180 took it to @entity22 , making a charge with 600m to go			2
@entity22 sailed past him and looked almost back to his best			2
‘ next year will be interesting , ’ he said , firing a thinly veiled warning shot in the direction of his @entity188 rivals			2
@entity26 , meanwhile , joked he was ‘ the biggest fluke going ’ , after taking his third major title in two years			0
it was a swipe at witless detractors who mock him for winning without breaking world records			0
@entity26 , now the reigning @entity120 , @entity196 and @entity123 champion , jumped an impressive 8.29m in the fourth round , improving on his second - round effort of 8.27m			0

‘ i had a slight tightening after the fourth and thought i ’d wait and see if someone could jump further			0
’ nobody did and the 27 - year - old celebrated by sprinting down the track draped in the @entity208			1
performance director @entity209 gave himself plenty of wriggle room before these championships , targeting a better finish than @entity214 in 2012 ( seven in total , four gold ) and worse than @entity57 in 2010 ( 19 , six gold )			0
in the end they achieved their best haul of 23 , with 12 gold , five silver and six bronze			0
‘ yes , these are the @entity43 , not global , ’ said @entity209			2
‘ but there were still some seriously impressive results and we are top of @entity227			0
it was an incredibly special sunday			0
