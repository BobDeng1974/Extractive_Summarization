@entity1 and not @entity2 was behind the hacking of millions of @entity5 phones , it was claimed today			1
in the latest extraordinary twist in the global eavesdropping scandal , @entity1 agents are said to have intercepted more than 70 million calls and text messages a month			1
up until now the @entity5 have been blaming the @entity2 , even summoning the country ’s @entity12 ambassador to provide an explanation			2
@entity5 first suspected the @entity2 of hacking into former president @entity17 ’s communications network when he was unsuccessfully trying for re-election in 2012			1

the @entity2 insisted they have never been behind any hacking in @entity5 , and were always keen to get on with the @entity5 , whom they viewed as some of their closest allies			1
they were so determined to be friends with the @entity5 , that @entity2 briefing notes included details of how to pronounce the names of the @entity5 officials			1
a note published in @entity20 shows that the @entity2 refused to rule out @entity41 , @entity1 ’s notoriously uncompromising intelligence agency , or the @entity43 , @entity1 ’s cyber-intelligence unit			0
today 's newspaper report was co-written by @entity46 , whose main contact is @entity49 whistleblower @entity48 ( pictured ) @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , the branch of the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) which deals with cyber-attacks , is referred to throughout the note			0
it reads : ‘ @entity52 intentionally did not ask either @entity41 or @entity43 whether they were involved as @entity5 is not an approved target for joint discussions			0
’ @entity20 ’s article , co-authored by @entity2 journalist @entity46 , whose main contact is @entity49 whistleblower @entity48 , however , hints that the @entity1 were doing the spying			2
both @entity2 and @entity5 intelligence work closely with @entity41 , but there is known to be a great deal of suspicion between all the agencies			2
a 2008 @entity49 note says that the @entity1 are ‘ excellent partners in terms of sharing information ’ , but it also says that @entity41 is ‘ the third most aggressive intelligence service in the world against the @entity2 ’			0
a spokesman for the @entity1 government told @entity20 : ‘ @entity1 is a country which is a friend , ally and partner of @entity5 and does not carry out any hostile activity which could pose a threat to its security			0
’ @entity5 has complained in the past about @entity41 's use of its soil to plan so called black operations including the 2010 assassination in @entity82 of @entity83 of the @entity85 movement @entity84			0
the revelation comes after senior @entity88 officials said they would be travelling to the @entity2 ' shortly ' to talk about allegations the @entity49 bugged @entity91 's phone			1
anger : @entity88 chancellor @entity91 ( left ) and @entity95 's @entity94 ( right ) have both voiced concerns over the @entity49 's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners the heads of @entity88 's foreign and domestic intelligence agencies will participate in high - level discussions with the @entity104 and @entity49 , government spokesman @entity100 said			1
news of the talks signals an escalation in the diplomatic tensions between the @entity2 and its allies after it was claimed the @entity49 had monitored the calls of 35 world leaders			2
@entity95 and @entity88 have joined forces in an attempt to pile pressure on the @entity115 to rein in the snooping activities			0
they want a @entity115 general resolution that promotes the right to online privacy			0
this step , the first major international response to the @entity49 's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners , comes after @entity88 chancellor @entity91 said the recent @entity2 espionage scandal has shattered international trust in @entity127			1
@entity91 said the recent espionage scandal has shattered international trust in president @entity127 not hacked : the @entity104 has denied that @entity131 's communications were ever monitored a month earlier @entity95 's president @entity94 branded the @entity49 's clandestine activities ' a breach of international law ' in a speech to the @entity137 and demanded steps be made to stop ' cyberspace from being used as a weapon of war '			1
@entity95 and @entity88 diplomats met in @entity143 yesterday to thrash out a draft resolution demanding the strengthening of privacy rights in the @entity147			0
while the @entity115 has no real power to reign in the @entity49 , there are fears among security experts that the effort alone could signal a growing consensus to freeze the @entity2 out of future international security dialogues .			2
