@entity0 , who was instrumental in cracking the @entity2 code , was found dead in 1954 at the age of 41 - reportedly from suicide code - breaking genius @entity0 - played by @entity6 in hit film @entity7 - was murdered , a new book claims			1
the brilliant mathematician who cracked @entity12 's @entity11 wartime code machines was found dead in 1954 at the age of 41			1
author @entity13 claims a note from the pathologist casts doubt over the official conclusion of suicide			1
the post mortem report said he died from cyanide poisoning , but the note adds that : ' death appears to be due to violence			1
' mr. @entity13 , a former mayor who has spent almost 30 years researching @entity0 and his work at @entity23 , said he was carrying out secret work before his death			2
he believes the code - cracker was killed by the @entity27 because he had information that would be ' extremely damaging or embarrassing			1
' mr @entity13 adds that @entity0 had been working on the top secret operation @entity30 , deciphering wartime radio signals to identify @entity33 agents in the @entity34			0

mr @entity13 , a founder member of @entity51 and former @entity53 mayor , said : ' i believe he was killed , perhaps by the @entity27 , and his death was made to look like a suicide			2
@entity0 's incredible life and work at @entity23 in @entity59 has been portrayed by @entity6 ( pictured ) in @entity7 @entity6 plays the genius mathematician , opposite co-stars @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 ( pictured in a scene from the film ) , as he cracks the @entity69 - a major factor in the @entity71 ' my theory is that he had stumbled upon some information that could be extremely damaging or embarrassing to certain people in @entity34			2
' his body was found on the tuesday morning and he was buried by wednesday afternoon			0
how could proper tests have been conducted in that time ? ' also there is no evidence he was depressed before his death			0
in fact there are reports from neighbours that he seemed cheerful			0
