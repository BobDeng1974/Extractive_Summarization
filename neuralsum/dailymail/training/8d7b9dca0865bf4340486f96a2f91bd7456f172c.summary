by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 04:01 est , 8 june 2013 pillar of the community : locals in @entity3 said it ' was a joke ' that @entity5 was arrested furious that his 14 - year - old son had been buying cannabis , @entity5 vowed to bring the dealer to justice			1
his anger was made worse by the fact his mother had recently been violently mugged for the sake of just £ 6 to buy drugs			2
but when the 53 - year - old tracked down the culprit and carted him to a police station , officers were not interested			1
they let the suspect walk free ... and put mr @entity5 in the dock instead			1
their decision triggered a five - month , £ 100,000 legal battle that ended only when the @entity26 decided to drop the charges without explanation			1
mr @entity5 had confronted the drug dealer in a ‘ sting ’ operation at a park , having been promised by police they would be there to make an arrest			1
no officers arrived and – following a fight – mr @entity5 , who is a dog warden and junior rugby coach , put the younger man in the boot of his car and drove to a police station			1
the station was closed so he telephoned officers who arrived 20 minutes later			2
to mr @entity5 ’s horror , they arrested him for assault – even though the dealer told them he did not wish to press charges			1
the next day he was charged with kidnap and causing actual bodily harm			0
that led to ten court appearances until , at @entity58 last month , prosecutors decided to offer no evidence and he was formally acquitted of both charges			1
one of his neighbours in @entity3 , near @entity58 , said : ‘ @entity62 is a pillar of our community			0
‘ he ’s there for young people week in week out at the rugby club and is well known in the area for being a lovely guy			0
' no one here will have a bad word to say about him			0
it ’s a joke that he was arrested in the first place			0
what a waste of everyone ’s time and money			2
’ mr @entity5 posted an emotional message on @entity81 about his arrest in january			1
in it he said his mother had been left black and blue by her mugging ordeal and needed hospital treatment , including stitches , for her injuries			0
he added : ‘ i would like to take this opportunity to thank my family , county councillors , community councillors , scout leaders and the people who have supported me over the past few weeks			0
battle : mr @entity5 appeared at @entity58 ten times during the five month legal struggle			1
last month , prosecutors decided to give no evidence and mr @entity5 was acquitted ‘ we have won the battle , but not the war over drugs in our community			1
we must stick together and keep on top of the drug dealers and report them to the police , so that they will always be looking over their shoulder in future			2
‘ we as a community have to help the police to get rid of this scum and hope they will respond to our concerns			2
' there will always be someone out there who will try to make money on the backs of our children by selling drugs to them			2
‘ they will cause misery and heartache to our families			0
our community is worth protecting			0
our children are worth protecting			0
our children are worth fighting for			0
’ no one from @entity128 was available for comment yesterday .			0
