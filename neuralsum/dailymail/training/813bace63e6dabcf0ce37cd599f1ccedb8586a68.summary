not content with being the largest search engine in the world , designing the most popular mobile operating system , creating a healthcare company and helping to develop lab - grown meat , @entity0 has now explained how it plans to solve societies biggest problems - through quantum computing			1
earlier this year @entity0 bought a quantum computer called @entity10 , which can perform tasks 3,600 times faster than normal computers			1
the company is hoping to use it to find cures for diseases , fix climate problems and help robots better understand human speech , for example			2
it is 3,600 faster than normal computers and could be used to tackle disease , climate change , and develop more sophisticated robots			1
@entity0 has created a video explaining the basics behind the computer and the company 's quantum project modern day computers run on a model designed by @entity45 in the 1930s			1
they are digital and use bits to transfer information and perform tasks			0
they use binary code and can only ever been in an active , or an inactive state - running at one or zero			0
this means that a single bit is either on or off at any one time			0
qubits work differently and can be on , off , or in a mixed state in between			0
as a result , qubits are able to be in multiple places at the same time			0
whereas the original @entity45 computer can only make one calculation at a time , quantum computers are capable of performing single tasks faster , and performing multiple tasks more effectively			2
tasks that would take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds using quantum computers like the @entity31			1
the company is hoping to unlock the power of the computer , which was built by @entity73 company @entity31 , at the new @entity74 , housed at @entity29 's @entity75 in @entity76			1
the video begins by explaining that : ' quantum physics puts everything into question ; it defies every intuition that you have about the natural world			2
@entity74 is a very strange regime of physics			0
' it goes on to explain objects can exist in a state of superposition - in which they can be one thing and another at the same time			0
it then moves onto quantum entanglement , quantum tunneling and the multi-verse , in which there are infinite numbers of other universes running parallel to ours			2
a @entity0 spokesman called @entity102 continues by explaining quantum computing uses these ideas behind quantum physics to process and calculate data at much faster speeds			1
@entity31 computers run on a 512 - qubit processor			2
normal computers are digital and use bits to transfer information and perform tasks			0
as a comparison , pcs found in homes run on 32 - bit or 64 - bit processors			0
the ' bits ' in modern - day computers can only ever been in an active , or an inactive state ; running at one or zero			0
this means a single ' bit ' is either on or off at any one time and they can only perform calculations individually			1
tasks that take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds by quantum computers , pictured			0
this , @entity0 explains in the video , makes quantum computers more capable of solving ' optimisation problems ' and gaining useful insights from data qubits work differently and can be on , off , or in a mixed state in between			1
as a result , qubits are able to be in multiple places at the same time and this means they are capable of performing single tasks faster , and performing multiple tasks more effectively			0
tasks that would take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds using quantum computers like the @entity147 @entity31 works closer to how the human brain works , but without the margin of human error			1
this , @entity151 explains , makes quantum computers , and the @entity31 specifically , more capable of solving what 's called ' optimisation problems			1
' an example of a basic - level optimisation problem explained in the video is if someone wants to travel across @entity160 , visiting 20 cities			0
a @entity31 128 - qubit processing chip			0
unlike ' bits ' found in normal computers that can only be on or off at any one time , qubits can also be in a ' mixed state ' between these points @entity0 's video also explains the basics behind the multi-verse , in which there are infinite numbers of other universes running parallel to ours with different variations of the same people this creates a huge number of variables , such as which order to visit the cities in , travel times , ticket prices , airlines , seat choices , routes , hotels , weather , attractions , events and so on			1
normal computers could solve this problem eventually , but quantum computers are better equipped to solve it quickly			2
this becomes even more important as the variables and complexities increase , and @entity0 is hoping to use the technology to develop cures for diseases , tackle the effects of climate change , better develop voice - activated technology and more			1
' in human civilisation we generate vast amounts of data , ' explains the video voiceover , including data on climate , genetics , ' but it 's very difficult to generate useful insights from that data			1
' @entity0 adds that quantum computers makes humans ' consider more sophisticated notions of how the reality around us is actually shaped			1
' ' we ca n't ask it how long we 'll live , or the meaning of life			0
really we do n't know what the best questions to ask this computer are and that 's exactly what we 're trying to understand now			0
' @entity0 could use the @entity31 quantum computer to further develop the technology in its self - driving cars			1
this is the view the cars currently see			0
future designs , created using the quantum computer , could better navigate the roads and react to obstacles in a more similar way to how human brains can the @entity31 quantum computer could be used to help robots understand human speech and lead to more sophisticated robotic designs , like the terminator in the classic sci - fi film the video adds : ' the greatest question is ' are we alone ? ' and we believe as quantum computers mature , they 're going to help us answer that question			1
' the @entity31 was first announced in may 2011 by the company based in @entity250 , @entity251			0
it was developed with financial backing from @entity254 founder @entity253			0
@entity31 was bought by defence group @entity255 in 2011 as part of a multi-year contract in a bid to try and solve some of its more challenging computational problems			2
in august last year , a team of @entity262 researchers were able to use the @entity31 to solve the largest protein folding problem ever , using the quantum computer			1
protein folding is a complex system found in all living things involving amino acids			0
@entity0 in particular could use the technology to improve the reaction times and processing speeds of its self - driving cars , or develop its @entity277 technology - a wearable computer that responds to motion and voice controls			1
to unlock this power , and test the computer 's potential , the two organisations have launched the @entity282 at @entity29 's @entity75 based in @entity76			2
@entity31 is also working on a quantum computer that will run on a 2,048 - qubit processor .			2

@entity0 's @entity31 computer is 3,600 times faster than a normal computer
it uses qubits to perform calculations and solve optimisation problems
in the video , @entity0 and @entity29 explain the basics of quantum computing
they *discuss* multi-verse theory and give an example of optimisation
faster speeds mean it can tackle complex problems such as disease , climate change and genetics
@entity0 hopes it will help develop sophisticated artificial life , and find aliens
