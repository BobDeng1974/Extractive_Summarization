by @entity0 last updated at 10:37 pm on 14th july 2011 a mother , whose two - year - old daughter died after her pet @entity4 python strangled and tried to eat her , was found guilty of third - degree murder on thursday			1
@entity6 , 21 , now faces up to 35 years in prison after a jury in @entity9 took two hours to also find her and boyfriend @entity10 , 34 , guilty of manslaughter and child neglect charges			1
defence lawyer @entity13 told the court in @entity15 that she has had to live with the horror ' like a dagger across her soul ' for two years			1
convicted : @entity6 and @entity10 also faced child neglect charges @entity21 , she said , never believed that her ' gentle ' 8ft 6in pet , named @entity23 , could be capable of killing a child and was distraught when her daughter @entity25 was found dead in her cot in july 2009 with the snake coiled tightly around her neck			1
the starving snake had been trying to eat her , according to a deputy chief medical examiner , @entity31			1
' there were also several clusters of puncture wounds that represent bites from the snake as the snake was trying to ingest her , basically , ' @entity31 told the jury while they viewed the grim post-mortem photos of the child			2
prosecutor @entity42 said in closing arguments that @entity21 and her boyfriend were completely at fault			2
the tragedy was , he said : ' needless , senseless , careless and reckless and the responsibility for @entity21 ’s death lies with those two defendants			2
' he showed the jury two pictures of the girl , one of her smiling happily and another of her after the post-mortem , which found she had been bitten by the albino snake and died of asphyxiation			1
@entity58 , he said , escaped from a tank over which the defendants had placed only a quilt as a makeshift lid			1
@entity21 burst into tears as the verdicts were read , while @entity10 showed no emotion other than to place his arm around her			2
both had rejected a pre-trial deal that could have seen them jailed for up to 10 years			1
huge beast : investigators take the 8ft 6in python from the property where it killed two - year - old @entity21 in her own closing arguments , miss @entity13 told the six - member jury that @entity21 was never anything but a ' loving mother ' to the toddler and insisted the girl ’s death was just an accident			1
@entity84 , another lawyer on the defence team , added : ' that event will shadow her for the rest of her life			2
' but there ’s not a scintilla of evidence that @entity92 was ever a bad mother			2
' we ’re talking about @entity58 , a pet that turned killer			1
did she look at this and say " @entity97 , is this potentially a killer animal that ’s going to kill us all ? " no , that was not her mindset			0
' but assistant state attorney @entity42 said that the couple should have known that keeping a deadly snake in a tank at their home in @entity108 , @entity9 , starving hungry and without a secure lid to keep it inside , posed a danger			0
the python had escaped several times before and had not been fed for a month			0
he also showed the court a photograph from 2005 when rangers in @entity9 ’s @entity115 found a 13ft @entity4 python dead after swallowing a six - foot alligator			0
he said : ' it does n’t take a rocket scientist			0
if that kind of snake will take down an alligator , it will eat something else – even a small two - year - old girl			1
' he added : ' the death of @entity21 was totally preventable			0
' the snake ’s not at fault in this case , folks , it ’s a wild animal			0
' but the defendants ’ lawyers said that @entity25 ’s death was just an awful accident , that had left them devastated			0
miss @entity13 said : ' @entity10 and @entity6 never in their wildest dreams ever thought this would happen			1
' they had no idea that their tame pet would suddenly go wild			0
' @entity10 , she said , was ' guilty of making a stupid decision and having a stupid pet			0
he ’s guilty of not being a dog lover , and liking snakes			0
' a sentencing hearing will be held at a later date .			0

@entity6 could face 35 years in prison
