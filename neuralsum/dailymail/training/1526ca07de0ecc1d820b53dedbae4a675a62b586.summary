it 's been more than ten years since @entity1 made its final transatlantic flight			0
but there 's a new generation of supersonic passenger aircraft beginning to emerge , boasting speeds at least twice as fast as current commercial planes			1
while these planes will first appear in the private and business jet market , catering only to the super rich with gargantuan price tags and first class service , supersonic may eventually reach regular holidaymakers			1
the aircraft would accommodate 80 passengers and have a tri-jet configuration in which one engine is on top of the aircraft and the other two are under each wing to reduce sonic boom			0
' to achieve revolutionary reductions in supersonic transportation airport noise , a totally new kind of propulsion system is being developed , ' said @entity43 , @entity18 manager of the @entity44 n +2 program			2
supersonic : the @entity47 jet will use proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology , flying at 1,217mph ' we are also exploring new techniques for low noise jet exhaust , integrated fan noise suppression , airframe noise suppression and computer customized airport noise abatement			1
' meanwhile , in @entity57 , @entity56 is teaming up with @entity26 - based aerospace firm @entity47 to create a supersonic jet that can fly from @entity59 to @entity20 in three hours and from @entity29 to @entity60 in six			1
the @entity47 business jet will fly at 1,217mph , using proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology - almost as fast as @entity1 , which flew at 1,350mph			1
engineers from @entity56 ' @entity64 will work with @entity47 at its base in @entity66			2
the cost of the @entity47 is thought to be more than $ 100million - over £ 60million - and @entity47 hopes test flights will begin by 2019			2
the cost of the @entity47 is thought to be more than $ 100m ( £ 60m ) - and test flights will begin by 2019 the jet , which will fly between major global cities , will be made mostly from carbon fibre composite material			1
design features include wings which reduce overall drag by 20 per cent , allowing for lower fuel consumption and longer range and a luxurious 30 - foot - long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers			0
@entity47 chairman @entity80 , said in a statement : ' this is a major step forward for @entity47			0
it puts us solidly on track toward our objective of certifying the world 's first supersonic business jet in 2021			2
' after 27 years of service , @entity88 retired the @entity56 ' concorde airliner - which travelled at more than twice the speed of sound - in october 2003 , signalling the end of the supersonic passenger jet			2
@entity94 : a 30 - foot - long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers in business - style comfort aerospace company @entity18 is behind the ambitious n +2 design			1
plane aims to fly from @entity20 to @entity21 in 2.5 hours - half the current five - hour time			1
the aircraft would accommodate 80 passengers and have a tri-jet configuration			0
designer aim to reduce noise caused by sonic boom			0
@entity56 is teaming up with @entity105 firm @entity47 to create a supersonic jet			1
the @entity47 business jet will fly at 1,217mph - 133mph slower than @entity1			1
test flights will begin in 2019 for the $ 100m ( £ 60m ) jet			0
@entity56 ' @entity64 will work with @entity47 at its base in @entity66			0
modern commercial long - haul jets typically cruise at speeds between 480mph and 560mph the plan is to certify the plane in 2021 with first delivery in 2022			2
flight testing would begin in roughly 2019			0
@entity47 officials knew it would take a well - established original equipment manufacturer to complete the project , he said			2
' we could n't be more delighted with the choice of @entity56 , ' @entity122 said			0
' we think that their footprint around the world is clearly going to help us as we develop the airplane			0
' flight testing could begin on the supersonic jet as early as 2019 with it becoming available in 2021 @entity131 has been open about his personal mission to offer the first business jet to fly faster than the speed of sound , a project begun in 2002			1
@entity136 , chief executive officer @entity137 , told @entity138 : ' the collaboration with @entity56 was an essential piece in order to bring the expertise of a premier aircraft development concern into the fold			0
' the @entity26 forbids civilian planes from the sound barrier - about 750mph per hour - while flying overland due to noisy sonic booms , but the @entity47 model will fly at subsonic speeds until it reaches the ocean , when it will speed up			1
over @entity150 it can fly at supersonic speeds without detection .			0

n +2 jet design is intended for commercial airliners - not just business jets
new generation of supersonic planes will fly more than *1,200mph*
@entity47 aims to create jet that can fly from @entity59 to @entity20 in 3 hours
