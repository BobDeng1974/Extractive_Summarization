the population of @entity1 has shrunk by nearly eight per cent in a decade , largely thanks to emigration			1
figures from the country ’s latest census showed yesterday that numbers have fallen by 1.5million over the last ten years			1
the key reason is that many younger @entity1 have departed to work in countries including @entity9 and @entity10 , leaving behind an ageing population and falling birthrates			1
@entity1 's population is falling as a result of migration and a low birth rate			1
last month several @entity1 squatters were found to be living in a ' shanty town ' illegally in @entity18 the census figures were published in advance of the new wave of emigration expected at the end of the year			1
in january @entity24 will open its labour market to citizens of @entity1 and @entity27			1
more than 100,000 @entity1 and @entity27 have already come to live in this country , but under @entity31 freedom of labour rules their citizens will be able to take @entity24 jobs without restrictions from january			1
the figures released in @entity36 yesterday showed that the @entity1 population was just over 20million in 2011			1
this was 1.55 million fewer than in the 2001 census			1
last month dozens of @entity1 immigrants were evicted from their camp on the former site of @entity43 in @entity18 some 68 mainly @entity1 squatters were living in the huts made of plastic and waste wood amid filth the population of @entity1 has fallen by 1.55million in just ten years according to the 2011 census in 1989 , when @entity1 emerged from the @entity53 communist dictatorship , the population was 23million			1
@entity54 has come under pressure to maintain restrictions next year in spite of @entity31 rules			2
ministers are deeply aware of powerful indications that @entity24 faces a large new influx of migrants			0
@entity1 and @entity27 are both deeply mired in poverty compared to most @entity31 countries			1
a @entity66 poll indicated in april that 8.2 per cent of @entity1 and 13.6 per cent of @entity27 are ready to consider travelling to @entity24 as a migration destination this year or next			1
@entity24 is a much more likely destination country than @entity10 or @entity9 , which are both suffering very high unemployment as their governments enforce austerity to deal with the euro crisis			0
last month police and immigration officials moved in to clear a ‘ shanty town ’ built by @entity1 migrants in a leafy @entity18 suburb			2
a total of 68 mainly @entity1 squatters were found living in huts built from waste wood and plastic amid the filth of a tip at the former @entity85 ground			2
the immigrants were said to have been living at the site for several months before the raid the @entity90 travellers were given papers ordering them to leave the site which had ' danger ' notices written in @entity1 just five of those at the camp , which was featured in the @entity96 earlier this month , were found to have the right to work in the @entity24			2
the rest were offered flights back to @entity1 at a cost of £ 50 per ticket to the taxpayer			2
only 19 took up the offer			0
those who did n't take the ticket were told they would have to leave the country within 30 days , but were released on to the street to live rough or in shelters			0
it could cost up to £ 15,000 for police to find each of them , monitor them and eventually remove them			0
@entity18 mayor @entity114 recently said that the country should give illegal immigrants amnesty			0
he said the government had to be ' honest ' that when someone has been in @entity24 for 15 or 20 years ' authorities no longer really pursue you '			2
but the prime minister has rejected the idea , warning last week that it would send out a ‘ terrible signal of @entity24 as a soft touch ’			0
@entity114 defied warnings from @entity54 to back the idea of allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the @entity24 the coalition has sought to take a tougher line on immigration , unveiling a raft of measures to curb benefit tourism and deport people in the @entity24 illegally			0
appearing on his new monthly radio phone - in on @entity138 , the @entity136 said : ' this is a chronic problem and if you look at what has happened in this country over the last 20 years , we have continuously failed to evict anybody			2
‘ if you look at the number of people who are staying here illegally and you measure that against the number that are meant to be on planes , it is absolutely astonishingly small			0
‘ the culture of human rights , the immense power of the ambulance - chasing lawyers who immediately come in and offer people protection against eviction , insert all sorts of delays into the procedure			0
it is blindingly difficult to get people on to planes			0
‘ they melt away into the maquis , into the undergrowth , and they are lost again			0
it is one of the reasons people lost confidence in the immigration system			0

population of @entity1 has fallen to 20 million in the last 10 years
2011 census showed a drop of 1.55million since the census in 2001
@entity1 *joined* the @entity31 in 2007 , allowing *increased* migration
this combined with the falling birth rate has caused the drop
