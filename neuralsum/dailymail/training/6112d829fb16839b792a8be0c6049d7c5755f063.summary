by @entity0 published : 07:45 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 07:45 est , 3 october 2012 the remains of two spitfires that were used for peacetime target practice by the @entity4 have been discovered on the same firing range nearly 60 years later			2
in 1954 , the surplus planes were dumped in the middle of the vast @entity8 in @entity9 for trainee pilots to strafe to hone their firing skills			1
the wrecks , which are still worth tens of thousands of pounds in their current state , were left in the remote spot and over the years became covered in long grass and weeds			1
the wreckage of two @entity2 used for peacetime target practice by the @entity4 have been found on the same firing range nearly 60 years later the surplus planes were dumped in the middle of the vast @entity8 in 1954 for trainee pilots to strafe to hone their firing skills the wrecks , which are still worth tens of thousands of pounds in their current state , were left in the remote spot in @entity9 and over the years became covered in long grass and weeds the machines remain in situ in the secret location on the plain - which is about the size of the @entity29 but plans are now in place to salvage what is left of the aircraft after historian @entity34 recently stumbled upon them during conservation work in the area			1
the fate of the two planes seems quite incredible now given the legendary status attached to the @entity2			1
fully restored versions of them are worth about £ 2million today			1
mr @entity34 looked through the @entity44 archives to identify these two as @entity46 and @entity47 , two @entity45 made in 1946			1
the fate of the two planes seems quite incredible now given the legendary status attached to the @entity2 the machines remain in situ in the secret location on the plain - which is about the size of the @entity29			1
it is understood the @entity53 plans to recover them in the near future			2
mr @entity34 , 51 , said : ' a colleague and i really just stumbled upon one of them by accident up a small hill			1
' i realised very quickly from the shape of it that it was the remnants of an aircraft			1
the wing clearly featured bays for guns			2
' but it was n’t until i got home and looked at comparison photographs that i identified it as a @entity2			1
' mr @entity34 checked the national archives which revealed that it was one of two given to the @entity75 at @entity76 , near @entity8 , for target practice in 1954			2
mr @entity34 returned to the scene and found the wreckage of the second @entity2 200 yards away from the first			2
he said : ' i could n’t believe that after all these years these two spitfires that had lain untouched and unseen for so long had been found			0
' the @entity46 and @entity47 aircraft would have been hit by the 30mm @entity83 fitted to @entity84 some 21,000 @entity2 were built during and after the @entity85 , although most were sold off for scrap in the early 1950s due to a shortage of metal			1
the emergence of the jet engine also hastened the demise of the propeller - powered aircraft			2
mr @entity34 , from @entity94 , @entity95 , said : ' spitfires were written off in the 1950s but there was a requirement for them to be used for training , like these two			0
' on june 1 , 1954 both aircraft were dispatched to @entity76			0
' @entity102 and @entity103 were erected as targets on the ranges at @entity8			0
' they would have been hit by the 30mm @entity83 fitted to @entity84			0
some 21,000 @entity2 were built during and after the @entity85			0
above , @entity4 fighter pilots run to their spitfires during an alert in 1940 ' i can only assume that the military chiefs thought they had been blown to pieces and left them there			0
' the area is so remote that it has been seldom visited over the years and their whereabouts became forgotten			0
' mr @entity34 believes the wreckage is still valuable today			0
he said : ' spitfires that crashed in @entity85 and were buried 20ft in the ground are still flying today after being salvaged			0
' it depends on what parts are left but collectively they could be worth tens of thousands of pounds			1
' spitfire pilot and expert @entity124 , who runs the @entity127 ’s only @entity2 flying school , said hardly anybody was interested in them after the war			0
he said : ' they were no longer needed and the military did n’t know what to do with them			0
' some were sold for scrap and some just buried in the ground			0
' it was n’t until about 20 or 30 years ago that there was a big revival of interest in them			0
' because they are so scarce , if you found one buried in a crater in a semi-preserved state and it came out still looking like a @entity2 , it could be worth £ 500,000			1
