by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:10 est , 7 february 2014 it 's hard enough to persuade young children to eat healthily but for @entity7 that campaign became a lot more difficult after opening a tin of sweetcorn to discover an inch - long caterpillar inside			1
ms @entity7 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , was preparing a healthy dinner for her two children @entity20 and @entity21 , aged eight and five , when she opened a tin of @entity18 sweetcorn and made a grisly discovery			1
she said : ' at first i thought it was a husk from the corn , but i picked it up and saw it had eyes			1
i screamed and threw it down			2
@entity7 said she screamed and threw the tin down after finding the dead bug ' i was going to give it to my kids to eat			1
' i would understand if it was in a normal lettuce , but not in a tin can			2
' the caterpillar measures just under an inch long			0
ms @entity7 said she bought the can of @entity41 sweetcorn from a branch of @entity18 in her hometown two weeks ago , but only opened it on tuesday			1
she tried to report the discovery to the store manager soon after but said nobody at the bargain retailer responded to her complaint			2
' i 'm really annoyed that they have not yet got back to me , ' she added			0
' something of that nature they should be back in touch straight away			0
' i was told i could not speak to a manager and ' i was annoyed because i felt they were n't taking the matter seriously			0
@entity7 ( centre ) was preparing dinner for daughter @entity21 ( left ) and son @entity20 ( right ) when she made the discovery the sweetcorn tin bought from @entity18 containing the one - inch caterpillar ' it was not that i found the product inferior , it was the fact i had found something dead in it			1
' an @entity18 spokesman said : ' we have strict quality control measures in place and take any complaints about the quality of our products very seriously			1
' we have asked mrs @entity7 to return this product so we can carry out a full investigation into what may have happened			1
