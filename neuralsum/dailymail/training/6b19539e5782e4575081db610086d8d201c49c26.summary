a boy on a serious seven day mission - this is now the third time @entity17 has accomplished this unusual feat for someone of such a young age			1

' but there was some talk on @entity40 that people were planning to get here on @entity43 , so i decided i 'd get here on @entity6			0
' his fascination with coins started when his mother showed him some of her own collection from when she was a child			0
