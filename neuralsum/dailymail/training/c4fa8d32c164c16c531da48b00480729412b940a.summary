by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:29 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 18 may 2013 @entity3 customers are unwittingly having money taken from their accounts through contactless payment cards – despite standing a foot from the till			1
shoppers say they are being charged on their contactless cards without knowing , simply by standing close to the machines			1
the problem was spotted only when a handful of eagle - eyed customers realised what was happening			0
it raises fears that more shoppers could have been charged without their knowledge			1
@entity3 customers complained that they have been charged twice for one transaction @entity20 , from @entity21 , told @entity22 ’s @entity24 programme that when she put her @entity26 card into the chip and pin terminal to pay at an @entity3 store , it charged her contactless card – which was in her purse in her other hand			1
a month later she looked at her bank statement and realised she had paid twice			0
when she returned to the store with the statement , she was given a refund			0
@entity37 , from @entity38 , told @entity24 she was charged on her contactless card – despite trying to pay with her @entity40 chip and pin one			2
she said : ‘ i put my card into the reader and the assistant was asking whether i wanted cashback			0
‘ before i could answer , the transaction came up as complete and the till issued a receipt , though i had n’t put in a pin at that stage			0
@entity3 say that they have full confidence in the technology and that they know of only five occurrences ‘ i queried it with an assistant and she looked at the receipt and compared it with my card and realised the numbers did n’t tally			2
’ @entity37 then discovered the smile card she had in her purse , which was in her other hand , matched the digits on the receipt			0
the manager had the transaction repeated to prove what was happening			0
@entity37 received a full refund on both transactions			2
last night @entity3 , which recently rolled out contactless payment in 644 stores , claimed the incidents were isolated and said it had full confidence in the technology			1
but the @entity71 , which represents debit and credit card companies , said more could be done to help customers and retailers and said it would investigate the errors			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we do think there is a bit more we can do in educating cardholders to tell them not to put their wallet down in this quite narrow field when they pay			0
‘ there is perhaps more shops can do in terms of cashiers knowing there are two forms of payment			2
’ @entity3 said it had been told of only five of these cases			1
it said : ‘ we ’ve had an overwhelmingly positive response from customers following the introduction of @entity97 , which helps to make payments quicker and more efficient for transactions under £ 20			1
‘ almost 250,000 transactions a week are now taking place in our stores on @entity97			1
