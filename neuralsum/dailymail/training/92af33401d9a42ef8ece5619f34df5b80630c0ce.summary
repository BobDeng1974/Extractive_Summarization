police in @entity1 claimed today the killing of two teenage girls allegedly raped before they were found swinging from a mango tree in @entity1 may not have been what it first seemed			1
the head of police in @entity1 's northern state of @entity10 , where the killings took place , has said the two girls may have been the victims of honour killings			1
@entity15 also claimed only one of the cousins had been raped and they had in fact been strangled before their bodies were strung up on the tree			1
officers will investigate the victims ' families , with relatives undergoing ' narco - analysis ' , whereby they will be interviewed under the influence of ' truth drugs '			1
three brothers have confessed to attacking and killing the young cousins , named @entity43 and @entity44 , in a case which has horrified @entity1			2
but in a hurriedly - called press conference , @entity15 said : ' according to the postmortem report of the deceased , one of the girls was not raped and it appears to be a case of honour killing			1
we are probing the matter			0
' we will conduct a lie detection test on all the accused who have been arrested			0
if needed , we will take the accused to @entity57 for the test and get the results			0
' the crime provoked national outrage after it emerged that police in the village of @entity26 initially refused to investigate the girls ' murder due to their low - caste status			1
brutal : women activists of @entity69 , flag seen top , face police water cannons as they demonstrate outside the office of @entity10 state chief minister protest : villagers in @entity10 hold a protest beside the tree where they discovered the bodies of two girls earlier this month but the state 's chief secretary @entity80 dubbed rape as a ' trivial incident ' and said the crime should not be blown out of proportions			1
he said : ' rape is a trivial incident and it should not be blown out of proportion by the media			0
the media should also look into the incidents where people have been falsely implicated in such cases			0
' the alleged killers - @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 - are members of the dominant @entity96 caste , to which most of the local police also belong			2
low - caste villagers from the community in @entity10 state have expressed concern that they could also be targeted in the wake of the horrifying attacks			2
in addition to the three suspected murderers , two police officers have been arrested for allegedly ignoring the victims ' parents when they reported that the girls , aged 14 and 15 , had gone missing			1
the girls ' murder has prompted protests in @entity115 and other @entity1 cities , in an echo of the outpouring of grief which came when a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital in 2012			2
in their home village , poor locals described their worries that they would be vulnerable to a similar attack in the future			0
although a rape is reported in @entity1 every 21 minutes on average , law enforcement failures mean that such crimes - a symptom of pervasive sexual and caste oppression - are often not reported or properly investigated , human rights groups say			0
