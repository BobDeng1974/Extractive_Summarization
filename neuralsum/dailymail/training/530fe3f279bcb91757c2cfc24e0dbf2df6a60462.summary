by @entity0 published : 03:36 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 27 august 2013 enjoyed by millions of consumers worldwide every day , many of our favourite food and drinks claim to be steeped in a tradition that saw generations before us savoring the same unmistakable tastes			0
@entity10 claims to use the same secret recipe as it did when the fizzy drink was first created some 127 years ago and fast food chain @entity13 says it sticks to colonel @entity15 ' original 1940 method for frying chicken			1
but are the most famous brands in our cupboards really true to their roots ? @entity20 ? @entity10 's 127 - year - old recipe , which manufacturers claim is still used today , sits in this overstated secure vault at the @entity26 museum , in @entity27 secret : a security guard stands outside the @entity31 vault - a popular tourist attraction photo opportunity : the vault is bathed in swathes of colourful lasers as tourists flock to have their picture taken outside it arguably the most famous soft drinks brand in the world , @entity10 says that its flagship drink uses the same secret formula as creator dr @entity44 in 1886			1
it even goes as far as keeping the original formula in a high security vault at its @entity47 of @entity10 museum - perhaps a sales gimmick argue some			1
but a 1994 book called @entity51 claimed that there have been a variety of changes to the @entity31 recipe over the generations and even claimed that it once contained cocaine in trace amounts , derived in the coca plants used to make the product - a claim that @entity10 has since dismissed as untrue			1
similarly , @entity63 also celebrates the roots of its flagship drink @entity65 invented by @entity66 and introduced as @entity68 's drink in 1893			2
but the drink was made sweeter in the 1930s when a new owner bought the firm and did n't like the taste and both @entity10 and @entity65 switched from sugar to high - fructose corn syrup in the 1980s			1
it was widely reported last year that both firms changed their @entity79 recipes to avoid having to put a cancer warning on the label			0
steeped in tradition : both @entity10 and @entity65 herald their long history history : @entity65 's first home office and bottling plant is shown in this 1906 file photo in @entity88 , @entity89 but a @entity10 spokesman told @entity91 at the time that rather than altering the recipe , the firm was merely changing the way it makes one of its ingredients to reduce the amount of 4 - @entity98 in the caramel			1
in fact when @entity10 tried to make the drink slightly sweeter in 1985 and relaunched it as ' @entity31 ' in the @entity79 there was a public outcry			2
less than three months later the company announced it was reverting back to the original recipe			0
its origins are also a big part of the way fast food chain @entity13 markets its fried chicken with inventor @entity15 still featuring in cartoon form on the brand 's signs			1
according to @entity115 , the @entity114 even dyed his beard white to achieve a more grandfatherly look in the early days			0
origins : @entity13 still uses a picture of @entity15 on its logo same taste : even products which have been added to the @entity13 menu use the same seasoning recipe says the company in a similar move to @entity10 , @entity13 also gave security surrounding the original formula an upgrade by installing a 770 - pond safe to guard it			1
although the recipe might still be the same as @entity15 ' , the production method is said to have changed			2
the founder is said to have been unhappy with the way chicken was handled after new owners bought him out in 1964			0
his friend @entity139 , founder of the @entity141 's chain , said that he was angry that the new owners drained grease off chicken by putting it on wire racks rather than spooning it off by hand			0
old favourite : @entity149 has relaunched with a seemingly new recipe but @entity13 say that the integral parts of the recipe - using fresh on the bone chicken , hand breading , frying under pressure and the recipe for the seasoning itself - remain exactly the same			1
even new introductions to the chain 's popular menu which include filleted chicken use the same seasoning , say the chain			0
when popular @entity79 snack @entity149 parent company ran into financial trouble in recent years the product was removed from the shelves			0
but the snack is back - albeit with a different recipe to that which millions of @entity79 enjoyed since its 1930 launch			2
@entity174 , which makes the product , said that the primary three ingredients remain the same , but the product has a noticeably longer shelf life and more ingredients listed on the packaging			0
it remains to be seen whether sticking to the original recipe really is a winning formula or whether a change will do @entity149 good			0
classic : @entity10 the exact recipe of @entity10 has always been a mystery and today 's official recipe is guarded 24 - hours a day in a vault in @entity27			1
the list of ingredients below are meant to be those used by pharmacist @entity44 , who created the drink in 1886 .			2

@entity10 claims to use the same 127 - year - old recipe in its current drink
@entity13 says it uses the same seasoning recipe as created by @entity15
while the recipe might remain the same , things are done differently today
