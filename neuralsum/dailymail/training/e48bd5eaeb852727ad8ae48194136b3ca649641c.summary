@entity0 blushes when asked what he made of @entity3 ’s recent description of him as a ‘ miracle man ’			1
the current @entity6 world player of the year may be a snarling brutish figure on the pitch , feared and revered in equal measure by opponents , but off it he is humble , self - deprecating and softly - spoken			1
‘ it ’s high praise to hear something like that from someone like @entity3 , ’ @entity0 said on wednesday when asked about the former @entity13 8 ’s comments			1
@entity6 world player of the year @entity0 is set to start against @entity20 at @entity21 on saturday @entity0 sits down to chat rugby ahead of saturday 's match with @entity25 's @entity24 ‘ he was someone i grew up watching and i know how much he achieved in the game			1
i just love playing the game and being able to express myself on the field			2
there are parts of my game i feel i ’ve improved a lot and can add value to the team			2
but working miracles ? no. ’ despite his humility , there is no escaping @entity0 ’s status as one of the greats of the world game			1
capped 70 times already and a key figure in the @entity46 winning side , the 29 - year - old will take on @entity20 at @entity21 on saturday in the prime of his already outstanding career			1
worryingly , the 6ft 4in 17st 4lb no 8 with the pace and footballing skills of a top - class centre , is pursuing a path of constant improvement			2
@entity55 ’s gifted forward @entity54 , along with his @entity13 team - mate and captain @entity57 , are sources of constant inspiration for @entity0			1
‘ to me when i look at a great player it is the consistency that sets them apart , ’ he said			2
‘ the greats are the ones who do it every week			2
if you look across sports someone like @entity54 scores goals every week , no matter who he ’s playing against			1
@entity0 revealed his admiration for @entity55 footballing superstar @entity54 @entity72 8 @entity3 heaped praise on @entity0 ahead of the autumn international series ‘ you have to have that mentality to start with and then once you ’ve got that i think it ’s about nailing your preparation and respecting every week you play			1
‘ that ’s what i try to do			2
i grew up playing alongside @entity57 for @entity81 and the @entity46 so it was n’t too hard for me to switch into that kind of mind - set when you train alongside him every week			1
‘ i probably always had that work - rate and mentality inside myself but once you start working and training alongside someone like @entity57 you see the level he lives up to every week			1
i just want to keep on improving and keep on getting better			2
that drives me on every day			2
’ @entity93 's @entity46 - winning captain @entity57 has been a mentor for @entity0 throughout his career @entity0 knows he will be tested by @entity20 ’s young pretender @entity95 at @entity21 on saturday , but after missing the first two tests against @entity98 ’s men following back - to - back concussions last summer , he is grateful just to be taking the field			1
he admits his wife @entity101 still has concerns about the possibility of her husband sustaining the sort of head knocks that have blighted @entity57 ’s career and ended that of former @entity13 full back @entity108			1
‘ it was a scary time with all the nausea and dizziness , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i know ( @entity20 lock ) @entity113 is going through it at the moment			1
you have a heightened risk after you ’ve had one concussion			0
‘ even though i was n’t showing any symptoms obviously the brain was n’t quite right			0
you just get unlucky sometimes			0
it puts things in perspective when you have to take that time off			0
it makes you realise why you love playing this game and why i love being part of this team			0
i missed a couple of @entity96 and it ’s not very nice when you have to watch the boys run out and you ’re not part of it			0
@entity0 struggled with concussion earlier this year and missed the first two test against @entity20 in june ‘ my wife is worried i guess			1
but she let me do it ( come back ) and she knew i was being looked after by the medics			0
but for me there was no way i was going to put myself at risk			0
i ’ve got a great family with two little girls now			0
i was never going to be risking my health in that way			0
i needed to make sure i was right and come back ready			0
i ’m good to go now			0
’ read - part of the @entity13 team that lost at @entity21 two years ago - returned for the third test in @entity147 as @entity149 ’s men completed a 3 - 0 series whitewash with easily their most comprehensive victory of an otherwise competitive series			1
but did @entity154 ’s men do enough to convince an eternally cynical @entity93 rugby public that @entity20 are finally trying to embrace a more expansive game - plan ? @entity0 anchors an @entity46 rolling maul as @entity20 's @entity159 attempted to stem the tide ‘ i think the public probably see the @entity162 as the @entity162 of old in terms of that arrogant tag and just playing a kicking game and whatever , ’ @entity0 says with a smile			1
‘ but on the evidence of what we ’ve seen in the last couple of years they are not really like that			0
they ’re a capable side			0
‘ they came with a game plan to really take it to us in june			0
they had chances , in the first test especially			0
we respected them , certainly , from the way they had been playing			0
from our point of view we probably did n’t play our best but we got the job done , which is pretty important in @entity96 matches			0
that ’s a confidence we can take in to the game on saturday			2
’ confidence is the last thing @entity98 and his men want coursing through this particular @entity46 veins			1
a humble @entity0 is quite dangerous enough			2
a miracle man , no less			0
@entity194 can only watch as @entity0 dives to score during @entity93 's 30 - 22 win at @entity21 last year @entity0 is wearing the new adidas @entity46 kit for 2014/15 – featuring the blackest @entity46 jersey ever			1
