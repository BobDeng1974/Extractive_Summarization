@entity1 political editor @entity0 has attacked @entity2 for urging the public not to vote in the general election			1
he said he had ‘ a beef ’ with the comedian and was an ‘ unapologetic believer in elections ’ after his @entity6 grandparents had to flee both the @entity7 and then the @entity8 in @entity9			2
brand was also dismissed by @entity15 yesterday as a ‘ pound shop @entity16 ’ after the self - styled revolutionary called the @entity19 ‘ clicky - wristed ’ and a ‘ snidey * * * * ’			2
critique : @entity1 political editor @entity0 says he has ' beef ' with @entity2 over his campaign urging the public not to vote in the general election @entity0 , 51 , told @entity25 he had some things he wanted to get off his chest ‘ at the beginning of a year that will determine not just who governs @entity30 but the future of the country itself ’			1
he insisted that politicians are not all the same and are not all in it for themselves , and ‘ it does make a difference whether you vote or not and who you vote for ’			1
he went on : ‘ are you listening , @entity2 , and admirers of the man with the most manicured chest in @entity30 ? ‘ you see i ’ve got a bit of a beef with @entity2			1
more than anyone i can remember in recent times he has energised , excited and enthused people about some of the great issues of our time			0
‘ and yet @entity2 continues to tell people that all politics and all politicians are corrupt or venal or a waste of time			1
make up your mind ! @entity2 says he only discourages voting because there is no one good enough to vote for , but has previously written that he discourages voting altogether ‘ these days he pretends that he ’s only ever argued that there ’s no one worth voting for , but not very long ago he wrote in the @entity60 – “ i will never vote and i do n’t think you should , either ”			1
’ brand ’s recent book revolution encouraged people not to vote in order to bring about a collapse in government			1
he has discussed his views on @entity69 and had a stylist straighten his chest hair before appearing on @entity72			0
brand , 39 , who has a fortune of around £ 9million , has been labelled a champagne socialist after leaving an anti-capitalist protest to attend a glitzy @entity77 party			2
he also campaigned for more low - cost housing , despite living in a rented £ 2million home owned by a firm based in a tax haven			0
nice chest : @entity2 , who has been labelled a ' champagne socialist ' had a stylist straighten his chest hair before appearing on @entity72 @entity0 said he had asked @entity2 for an interview , ‘ but as he posed for a few selfies i was told he was too busy ’			1
he added that it was his job to be impartial when reporting for the @entity1 , but ‘ i am not required to be impartial between democracy and the alternatives			1
if @entity1 ever asked me to be i ’d refuse			1
‘ my @entity91 @entity90 grandparents were forced to flee the @entity7 and then , later , the @entity8 who took over @entity9 , the place they ’d sought refuge			0
in this election year i am an unapologetic believer in elections ’			0
brand , who last month called @entity98 a ‘ pound shop @entity99 ’ , turned his sights on @entity15 at the weekend , saying on @entity102 ’s @entity103 : ‘ i shook his hand once			2
all clicky - wristed , he was a snidey * * * *			0
’ the @entity19 told the @entity1 ’s @entity106 : ‘ i ’m not quite sure what clicky - wristed means			2
i do n’t know whether that ’s supposed to be offensive or funny or whatever			0
’ he added : ‘ he ’s quite funny sometimes			0
i think probably @entity97 is a rather better political commentator			0
i suppose you could call him a pound shop @entity16			0
