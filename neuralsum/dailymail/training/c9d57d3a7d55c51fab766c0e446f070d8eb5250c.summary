hackers proclaiming allegiance to @entity2 broke into a @entity4 account for a military families ' support organization and used it to threaten soldiers ' wives			1
the shady group took over an account on the social network operated by the @entity13 for strength nonprofit , then used it to target women who had spoken out against their jihadist organization			1
' you think you 're safe but the @entity19 [ @entity20 ] is already here ' , the hijacked account blasted out to six military wives in succession			1
targeted : @entity24 ( left ) was singled out by the hacker , as was @entity26 ( right ) ' @entity27 got into your pc and your smartphone			2
' the victims were seemingly handpicked because they spoke out in an earlier story about jihadist hackers turning on the military			2
in the wake of the @entity4 account for the @entity38 's @entity37 being compromised , the women had spoken to @entity39 for an article published in january			1
@entity41 , who runs @entity42 , told the network then : i see being online as a way to stay honest , to stay healthy , to help			2
' i do n't want that to be hurt because of some threats that are just some dumb hacker			2
i do n't want to let them win that way			0
' the women , who largely agreed that they would not be intimidated , ended up on the hackers ' hitlist as a result			0
threats : these messages were sent to six military wives			0
threats were also sent to president @entity57 some tweets posted from the account also contained threats to president @entity57 and his family , @entity58 reported			1
the account has since been suspended , and the messages in question deleted			0
@entity24 , an officer 's wife who was targeted , said she was shaken by the messages			0
she also got sent a friend request from a man apparently affiliated with the hacking group			0
she told @entity39 : ' i would be lying if i did n't say it ( made ) me a little nervous , i do n't think you can receive what appears to be a personal threat from @entity2 without being nervous			1
' however , writing later in a blog post she said she had no intention of ' giving them the victory ' of staying afraid .			0
