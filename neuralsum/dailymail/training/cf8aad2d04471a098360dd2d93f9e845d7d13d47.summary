the audio footage , lasting around 45 minutes , began with @entity36 telling his wife that she looked ‘ fantastic ’ , as she prepared for a weekend away with mr @entity87			1

he will forever have to live with what he has done			0

i am satisfied that the bruises to her face and defensive bruises to her hands were inflicted by you in anger			0

it 's apparent that before you went down to fetch the knife she was terrified and she really was afraid that you were going to kill her			2
‘ you went back upstairs and within moments were attacking your wife			0
it 's clear that you were overwhelmed by a jealous rage and stabbed her and slashed at her repeatedly			0
’ judge @entity139 added : ‘ nobody now can predict the degree of emotional and psychological trauma he ( mr @entity7 ’s young son ) will suffer in future years but it will be significant			1
‘ whatever suffering you will go through , it is nothing compared with that which you have caused to your children and to your wife 's family and of course to @entity10			1
