by @entity0 @entity1 , grandson of @entity1 , now presents the reality tv show about infidelity - @entity3 let 's say you suspect your spouse of having an affair			1
would you enlist the help of a tv show to find out what they were getting up to and with whom , then let it catch them in the act on live television - and drag you along too in the hope of an angry confrontation with the cheating couple ? probably not , but that 's the premise of @entity21 show cheaters , and although reality television does n't come much more intrusive it 's become a compulsive and unlikely hit			1
and its presenter is rather unlikely too , a descendant of one of the biggest stars in @entity29 history - and one of its most notorious womanisers to boot			0
@entity1 is the 25 - year - old grandson of the @entity34 who @entity35 said produced in her ' a sexual urge beyond belief '			1
what would @entity40 think of the heir to the family name hunting cheating husbands with a camera crew ? ' i think he 'd have a good laugh			0
it 's about the sort of things - women , sex , infidelity - he used to surround himself with , ' says @entity1			1
that would be putting it mildly			0
@entity1 went to epic lengths to hide his own myriad affairs			1
five times married , he sired only two children - @entity1 's father @entity59 , and @entity62			1
the latter was the product of an affair with actress @entity66 that began on the set of @entity68 in 1935 , and the pair were so keen to avoid any scandal that she fled to @entity72 to hide her pregnancy , later secretly giving birth and only ' adopting ' the baby 19 months afterwards			0
@entity1 came to see @entity62 just once , when she was 15 , but she did n't know he was her father until she was 31 and he 'd been dead five years			1
' it was great back then ; the studios would hide anything you wanted , ' says his grandson			2
is it more honest now ? ' that 's a strange word to use for the entertainment industry , ' he laughs			2
@entity1 is the 25 - year - old grandson of the @entity87 star @entity1 ( pictured ) who @entity35 ( also pictured ) said produced in her ' a sexual urge beyond belief ' meeting @entity1 begs the question - whatever happened to the @entity91 ? his father @entity59 , he reveals , has spent his whole life trying to distance himself from his own famous father 's shadow			1
the @entity29 star had always wanted a son but tragically died in 1960 , just three months before @entity59 was born			0
@entity59 was brought up by his mother , the star 's fifth wife @entity98 , out of the limelight on @entity1 's huge @entity102 ranch			1
' at school graduation when they called my name out , every parent stood up to see who i was ' there were several threats to kidnap him and a troublesome childhood ended up with him being sent to school in @entity115			0
' he told me he used to throw lemons at all the tourists who came to look at the family home , ' says @entity1			1
although @entity59 - who 's now 53 and also has a daughter , @entity120 - did a little acting , he soon moved into stunt work before following his passion for motor racing			2
the more dangerous the better , says his son			0
in 2012 @entity59 , who is divorced from @entity1 's mother @entity126 , made headlines when his girlfriend at the time , celebrity make - up artist @entity128 , was found dead at their @entity131 home after a suspected drug overdose			1
@entity1 is intent on restoring some of the family 's acting glory and following his famous grandfather into film			1
he 's been modelling since he was three but @entity3 is his first turn in front of the camera , although he had a role in a low - budget @entity143 thriller that 's yet to be released			1
he 's now presented two seasons of @entity3 and says he can no longer be shocked by what people get up to in their private lives			1
nothing is scripted or faked , though they edit out the frequent occasions when he introduces himself to stunned cheaters and they do a double take at his name @entity1			2
like the offspring of other stars , he believes that having a famous name opens doors to begin with but can be a hindrance when you 're expected to live up to your illustrious forebear			0
@entity1 never met his grandfather who tragically died before the birth of his son @entity1 feels @entity59 avoided acting because he was intimidated by the thought of trying to emulate his father 's success and , as a result , he also showed a complete lack of curiosity about the colourful life of a man who , of course , he never knew			1
@entity1 finds this completely maddening			2
' all my father knows about him is what he 's seen on film			0
i feel he dropped the ball for a generation and i really want to pick it up again			0
' so what was it like growing up @entity1 ? ' it was both cool and a nightmare			2
at school graduation when they called my name out , every parent stood up to see who i was , ' he says			0
and people still think he 's having them on when he mentions his name			2
' i always carry three different pieces of @entity195 just to prove it , ' he says			0
@entity1 has done some digging into his grandfather 's story			1
he enjoys telling how he was @entity200 's favourite film star , with the @entity201 even putting a bounty on his capture			0
' he wanted my grandfather to make a propaganda film to crush the @entity21 fighting spirit , ' says @entity1			2
the star did n't return his admiration , flying as a gunner on @entity21 bombing missions against the @entity211			0
so what does he know about his grandfather ? he loved riding and hunting , he says			0
more surprisingly , he even dabbled in cock - fighting , handing down to @entity59 an ornate pair of 1940s cock - fighting blades ( the spurs that are attached to fighting cocks ' feet ) in a box with @entity1 's name engraved on it			1
not something today 's stars would ever dream of indulging in			0
' it 's pretty crazy to think about it , ' agrees his grandson			2
another fine souvenir his father inherited was a framed letter @entity231 wrote to @entity1 apologising for making his ears too big when he included an animated version of the star in a couple of 1940s cartoons			2
' i heard my grandfather was very upset about that , ' says @entity1			2
neither @entity1 nor @entity59 inherited @entity1 's famously oversized ears but there 's one thing all three generations of @entity244 share : an obsession with women			1
@entity1 , who 's single , says it 's ' almost an addiction ' for him			1
and his twice - married father is no different			0
' it 's hard when we go out together , ' says @entity1			1
' he tries to pick up women my age			0
he gets jealous , i suppose			0
' @entity40 would be nodding with approval			0
cheaters , weeknights at 11pm from 14 april , @entity255 .			0
