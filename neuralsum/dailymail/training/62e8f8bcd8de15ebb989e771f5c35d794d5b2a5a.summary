a @entity1 student newspaper caused a racial storm after publishing a poll that said white people are the most attractive race			1
the @entity8 ’s ( @entity8 ) @entity7 newspaper conducted a survey of 60 students to decide which race is the most attractive			1
it showed that 38 per cent of those surveyed thought that whites were the most attractive , while @entity15 had the lowest rating with just eight per cent			2
outrage : white people were found to be the most attractive with 38 per cent of the vote , while @entity1 people came last with just eight per cent the survey took in a wide range of ethnicities , with people from who were white , @entity25 , @entity26 , mixed race , black or ‘ coloured ’ backgrounds			1
the poll , which was conducted to accompany an article entitled ‘ @entity32 ’ by student @entity31 , has been condemned as racist			1
the paper was forced to apologise after students and human rights activists complained			1
the @entity36 of @entity1 lodged a complaint with the country ’s @entity38 as they believe that the ‘ charade of a survey ’ incited racial hatred			0
they said : ‘ the article and its alleged survey were always leading to inculcate a culture of one race being the jewel of all others			2
it is despicable to read			0
’ the university , which is considered among the best in @entity1 , only chose to remove its race - based admissions policy in february			0
academic : the @entity8 is considered one of the best universities in @entity1 the @entity55 said that they paper should have showed greater respect to an issue that had a ‘ painful historical significance ’			2
even @entity1 human rights activist @entity60 tweeted that the poll was ‘ racist nonsense ’			1

@entity66 wrote : ' @entity8 varsity newspaper has lost the plot			1
why are even wasting time discussing what the most attractive race is ' @entity71 said : ' wow			0
but the editorial team of @entity8 's " @entity7 "			1
i wish , for their sakes , the whole piece had been a misprint			0
they ca n't have been thinking			0
' editor - in - chief of @entity80 issued an apology to anyone who was offended			0
she said : ‘ i am aware of the controversy surrounding the sensitivity of race and i understand that the right to freedom of expression has its limits when used unnecessarily to discriminate against others , slandering religion , race , sexuality			0
‘ however , @entity7 feels that the writer was not abusing this right nor had the intention of issuing an attack on individual racial groups , but simply pinpointing a matter that is still affecting the lives of @entity1			2
