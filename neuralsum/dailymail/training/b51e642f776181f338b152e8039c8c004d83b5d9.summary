by @entity0 @entity0 ' @entity1 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			0
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
this week , @entity10 would be happy to see a return to standing terraces , says @entity13 look too lightweight for a serious title challenge , while @entity15 remain in fine hands with @entity17 but @entity19 's dismissal of @entity20 prove football is still bonkers			1
i would love standing terraces to return			1
when i was a little boy , many a saturday afternoon and wednesday night was spent stood on the @entity25 at @entity27 's @entity26			0
a return : standing terraces could be re-introduced in @entity30 football the atmosphere , the banter , the singing , the humour , team spirit and camaraderie ; people standing in the same position come @entity39 , proud and passionate to support their club			1
of course , first and foremost , in - depth research and studies must ensure there are adequate safety measures and lessons must be learned from tragedies in the past			2
after the @entity50 clubs backed calls for safe - standing at @entity53 stadiums last week it moved a step closer to happening			1
atmosphere : many believe a return to standing would improve the matchday experience in @entity61 , all @entity60 grounds have terraced sections and the atmosphere in the singing section is second - to - none			1
there 's no reason why it ca n't work over here			0
@entity68 will be concerned at how his @entity13 team folded at @entity70			1
when you compare @entity68 's side now to the @entity74 of 2003 - 04 , they played similar fantastic football , but their two centre - backs of @entity77 and @entity78 and two centre midfield players of @entity80 and @entity81 were men made of steel			1
folded : @entity13 lack the mental strength and winning mentality to seriously challenge for the title collapse : @entity13 have crumbled when facing the best teams in the @entity89 they had a winning mentality and in the face of the fiercest storms they could go toe - to - toe and trade blows with the toughest opponents out there			1
at the moment @entity13 are lightweight in that area and i doubt they can challenge for the top spot			1
with their flair and quality technical players it will be another @entity102 spot , which will be the 16th consecutive year for @entity68			0
silver lining ? @entity13 still have more than enough talent to finish in the top four @entity105 ? only a few weeks ago , people were clambering on the band wagon and all the critics , sat comfortably in their armchairs , were saying he should be sacked			1
in good hands : @entity15 will not be relegated as long as @entity17 is in charge crucial : @entity113 's absence has weakened @entity15 the fact of the matter is , he did n't have his best players available			1
he was missing a whole back four and an outstanding centre forward			2
people tend to forget this is only @entity15 's second season back in the @entity89 and this campaign they have kept 12 clean sheets – the most in the league			1
there will be ups and there will be downs , but mr @entity128 and mr @entity129 should be commended for going against the grain and standing by their man			2
double : @entity134 scored both goals in @entity15 's 2 - 0 win at @entity137 in the last three games they have drawn away to @entity140 , beaten @entity19 and on saturday put another two past @entity137 to move up to 15th			1
it looks like they made the right decision			0
not even @entity19 sacking @entity20 after he won the club their first major silverware and led them into the @entity148			1
if you look at the trends , teams that qualify for the @entity148 often struggle to cope			0
surprise : @entity19 sacking @entity20 after he won the @entity153 and lead the team into the @entity148 was a surprise in @entity61 the two teams who qualified for the @entity148 are at the wrong end of the @entity60 table			1
@entity160 are 12th and @entity161 are 15th , just one place above relegation			0
in @entity165 @entity164 qualified for the competition and are bottom of @entity168			0
last season @entity170 's @entity169 had a torrid time coping with the extra games and the travelling			0
it led to injuries , fatigue , defeats , a negative feeling and the prospect of relegation			0
same treatment : @entity170 's @entity169 struggled last season because of @entity184 commitments but have been much better this season after winning manager of the year in the previous season , people were calling for @entity170 's head			2
now they are out of that competition and their key players have been available , he 's shown what a good manager at @entity89 level he is			0
at @entity19 , @entity20 lost an outstanding player in @entity195 through injury			1
he makes a difference and can change games			0
key man : @entity195 is a game change and his injury has affected @entity19 stand in : @entity202 has scored important goals but has not matched @entity195 's success last season although @entity19 have excellent stats in retaining possession it was @entity195 's performances that would turn that possession into wins and points on the board			1
@entity195 does not have a position to play in			1
he does n't play centre forward , he does n't play in the hole , but he drifts into areas where it 's very difficult for him to be marked and opposition defences get pulled out of position allowing other players to break into space and cause problems			0
he has blistering pace and quality technical finishing			0
losing this talent has clearly taken its toll on the manager			0
debut : @entity228 won in his first match in charge at the @entity231 people have said he should not have gone to @entity233 for a two - day break after the @entity15 defeat			1
but all managers are under huge pressure and in my mind , to get away from it all , have the chance to clear his mind and freshen his body up , should not be criticised			0
looking at @entity246 from afar , it looked like the pressure had taken its toll and his own welfare is more important			0
there 's no doubt he will bounce back			2
on tuesday night i continued my search , watching @entity255 players and clubs , by going to @entity257 versus @entity258			0
it absolutely lashed it down at @entity263 's @entity262 stadium , but the passion and commitment of all the players and the managers – who probably worked at their real jobs all day – and the supporters from both clubs made it a great occasion for me			0
the players were all sliding into tackles , playing good football and i just love how humble and focused they were			2
it annoys me when people forget where they come from			0
these types of clubs deserve more help from the @entity281 and a share of the huge sums of money in the @entity89			0
as the teams were about to come out after the half - time break , a song from @entity288 was played at full blast in the dressing room of @entity258			2
soaked to the skin , the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as i heard the inspirational piece of music			2
somebody had obviously given that a lot of thought and the players responded well by going on to win the game 3 - 0			2
i 've also been reading closely what 's happened with @entity303 and the @entity305 cricket team			1
the thing that strikes me is this : i have no idea , after the betrayal of his team - mates , his captain and the country , by sending text messages to the opposition 's captain when they played @entity317 , how @entity303 was ever allowed to wear the @entity305 shirt again			1
to do what he did , behind @entity320 ' back , showed the real character and personality of an undeniably talented man			2
there is a fine line between genius and madness			0
there 's no doubt that @entity303 is a genius with a cricket bat , but this is a team game , not a one man , stand - up show .			2

a return to standing terraces will bring atmosphere back to football
this @entity13 team lack the winning mentality for a title fight
@entity15 will be fine with @entity17 in charge
@entity19 sacking @entity20 shows how bonkers football is - they 've missed @entity195
