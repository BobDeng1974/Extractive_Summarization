staff at @entity38 ( pictured ) became suspcious of @entity2 's activities earlier this year ' on the face of it it 's hard to accept that bullying of such a childish nature has led to this - the difficulty is that he is a very withdrawn and timid man , who simply does not have the capacity to stand up to these bullies or report it to his line manager			1
