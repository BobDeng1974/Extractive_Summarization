by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:43 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 2 december 2013 an unflappable president @entity2 is facing increased pressure as his signature legislative achievement hobbles under the weight of unmet goals and lowered expectations the @entity11 website 's performance in november showed improvement over october 's dismal start , but the total number of @entity1 taking advantage of the @entity11 is less than half what the @entity2 administration projected			1
and president @entity2 's top cheerleaders are showing cracks in their armor , with the @entity23 secretary advising consumers in a @entity26 essay to use healthcare.gov during ' off - peak hours			1
' ' please do not give up , ' secretary @entity29 pleaded			1
the @entity23 set an @entity11 enrollment target of 800,000 by the beginning of december			1
so far , according to published estimates , it has reached between 300,000 and 350,000			0
@entity34 reported monday morning that when government releases the final numbers for healthcare.gov in november , it will hover at around 100,000			2
and @entity39 reporter @entity38 tweeted two hours later that the nationwide total would reach ' 200 - 250k w / states			0
' that larger number would include the @entity11 enrollments from the 14 states , plus the @entity45 , that are running their own insurance exchanges			2
in october , just 26,794 people signed up for health insurance plans via the federal government 's online portal			0
another 79,391 enrolled through the state - based websites			0
in addition to falling short of the administration 's two - month projection , that number is just 5.1 per cent of the 7 million sign - ups the @entity65 needs by the end of march in order to ensure the program 's solvency for the first year			1
meanwhile , more than one - third of the enrollment period has already elapsed : @entity1 who want government help to obtain coverage for 2014 have until march 31 to apply and select plans			0
those who want their coverage to begin on january 1 have just two weeks left to enroll			0
the @entity2 administration expects enrollment rates to increase significantly as the march deadline approaches			2
@entity62 , a long - time former @entity2 senior adviser – now an @entity87 contributor – told network host @entity88 on sunday that the @entity11 will ' work really well ' when all 50 states are running their own health care exchanges and have fully expanded @entity92			1
' it may take until 2017 when this president leaves office , ' he said			0
but ' it 'll work really well then			0
' @entity97 , the administration 's former budget director and newly minted point - man on the @entity11 website 's fixes , told reporters on sunday that the online portal is running vastly better than before @entity45 , we have a problem : boasting the @entity11 website 's 95 per cent up - time still leaves room for it to crash for 1 out of every 20 users -- plus more down - time for ' scheduled maintenance ' it 's not working well now			1
despite @entity29 ' suggestion that off - peak hours would see better website performance , @entity57 saw familiar error messages shortly after 6:00 est monday morning			1
' testing it ourselves ' : do n't look now , but @entity11 is crashing again -- live on @entity57 ' we 've been trying to get into the site since october 1 on and off again , ' said @entity57 medical producer @entity56			1
' i have to say it did work a lot more smoothly this morning			2
i put in all of my information and i got through the whole process in eight minutes			0
' ' and then it said my status was in progress			0
so i went to refresh it and i got the error message			1
' the @entity65 has not released any demographic numbers showing who is signing up for the government - brokered insurance plans			2
the most important group is young people , whose relative good health is expected to allow the system to pay for older and sicker @entity1 ' health care			0
in a sunday morning report seemingly timed to bury bad news in the middle of an extended holiday weekend , the administration boasted about its tech team 's ability to fix software errors but conceded that @entity145 is still failing 5 per cent of the time – not including hours of scheduled down - time			1
' while we strive to innovate and improve our outreach and systems for reaching consumers , we believe we have met the goal of having a system that will work smoothly for the vast majority of users , ' the report from @entity23 read			2
it acknowledged that overall , only about 80 per cent of users are able to successfully navigate the website in its current form			0
@entity23 secretary @entity29 begged @entity26 readers : ' please do not give up ' on @entity11			1

@entity2 @entity65 set target of 800,000 enrollments by nov. 30 , but a best - case scenario looks more like *355,000* so far
@entity23 secretary @entity29 begged @entity26 readers on monday : ' please do not give up '
the administration boasts healthcare.gov is up 95 per cent of the time , but a former senior adviser says @entity11 might not work right until 2017
@entity57 's medical producer tried another on - air test of the website sunday morning , and got another dreaded error message
