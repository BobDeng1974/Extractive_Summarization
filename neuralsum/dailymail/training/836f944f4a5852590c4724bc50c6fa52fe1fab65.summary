with a swimming pool , football pitch , and helipad sprawling across 16,000 square feet of land , it is hard to imagine this was once a tiny family home			1
the enormous estate , carved into a cliffside , started life as a two - storey cottage			0
but property developer @entity11 and his wife @entity12 saw potential for a great deal more			2
it now has a swimming pool , football pitch and a helipad helipad : the helipad , overlooking 10 miles of countryside , allows the couple and their two sons @entity30 , nine , and @entity31 , four , to get to @entity32 in an hour light : the family made sure to put windows wherever possible so that the underground property is filled with light and does not have damp despite heavy planning restrictions , the couple worked closely with an architect to transform their home into something 10 times the size - and a good deal more expensive			1
now on the market for Â£ 4.75 million , it is unrecognisable			0

mr @entity11 , who owns @entity105 team in @entity106 , said : ' it is essentially a modern day country house in size , but if you took out our indulgence , the swimming pool , it would have the same energy costs as a three bed semi			2
' temperature in the home is controlled using a unique air tower which releases hot air in the top and lets in cold air at the bottom			0
innovative : the underground home is heated by a network of caves , which has helped @entity11 and his wife @entity12 get round planning restrictions open space : this living space and kitchen area , complete with a breakfast bar , is set in the space above the 100ft hall way cutting edge : property developer mr @entity11 said he has worked for years with an architect to develop the home from a shabby cottage into a modern complex despite the vast amount of open space , the home has the same energy costs as a three - bedroom semi-detached cottage , mr @entity11 claims the amount of air released can be regulated depending on the time of year to maintain a constant internal temperature			1
