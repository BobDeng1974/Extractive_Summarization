by @entity0 ' it 's no big deal ' : @entity4 , standing for next year 's @entity2 on a no - unskilled - foreigners ticket , has never revealed his @entity6 ancestry the voters of @entity8 will decide whether @entity4 becomes a force in @entity11 politics or remains on the periphery			1
yet , despite a host of interviews over the past decade and a supposedly tell - all autobiography , @entity4 has yet to give them a full account of himself			1
for while it is well known that mr @entity4 ’s wife @entity22 is @entity6 , the @entity19 leader – standing for next year ’s @entity2 on a no - unskilled - foreigners ticket – is yet to admit in public that he himself is the descendant of immigrants			1
today , a mail on sunday investigation can reveal that mr @entity4 ’s grandmother , born @entity29 , descends from @entity6 immigrants who fled to @entity31 in search of work and a better way of life			1
it ’s a secret he has kept close to his chest ever since his election to @entity19 ’s leadership in 2006			1
in the many interviews the party leader has given in the past decade , he has never referred to his @entity6 ancestry			2
neither do his ancestors rate a mention in his self - congratulatory memoirs flying @entity46			2
indeed , in the book he refers to his grandmother @entity29 as having ‘ @entity50 - style aspirations ’ , apparently all very @entity51 , all very decorous			1
but in their three - bed semi in @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity29 ’s father and mr @entity4 ’s great - grandfather , @entity58 , a lowly @entity60 sorter , is unlikely to have encouraged the upper - crust tales dispensed by @entity62			1
he ’d grown up the hard way , living in rented rooms in the @entity6 quarter of @entity66 behind @entity67 – an area awash with refugees and prostitutes			0
last year , in a confrontation with @entity72 political editor @entity71 , mr @entity4 had the opportunity to set the record straight			1
@entity71 drew attention to the fact that the politician ’s second wife , @entity22 , was born in @entity79			1
why , @entity71 asked , did mr @entity4 give the job of secretary to a @entity6 when it could have gone to a @entity82 ? mr @entity4 insisted that ‘ nobody else could do that job ’ , which included checking emails for him at midnight			1
he might have added : ‘ @entity6 are very hard - working , as i should know – my people come from @entity87			1
’ but he did not			0
so today , we supply the missing piece of the jigsaw which makes up the @entity4 story – the @entity6 connection			2
during the middle part of the 19th century , emigration was a popular option among those who lived in the federation of @entity6 states ( @entity6 did not become a country until 1871 )			0
religious persecution , a sharp economic downturn and rising land prices were driving @entity6 from their homeland			0
what @entity108 would have made of his great - great - grandson 's ' keep them out ' rallying cry , one can only guess millions went to @entity114 , while others saw their future here			1
@entity108 , mr @entity4 ’s great - great grandfather , was a young cabinet - maker in @entity87			1
he married his sweetheart @entity117 at 21 , but before starting a family he decided his shaky prospects would be much improved by moving to @entity51			1
it was the 1850s , a time of rapid expansion and a new prosperity fuelled by the @entity124			0
@entity31 , then as now , was the land of promise			2
however , the benefits system had not been invented and those who fled to these shores came in the hope of a fair day ’s work for a fair day ’s pay			0
@entity132 , professor of @entity133 at @entity134 and a leading expert on @entity6 migration , points to the large number of @entity6 musicians who ’d recently moved to @entity66 , bringing with them a wider appreciation of classical music and encouraging a broader culture among the educated classes			0
their presence added a new zest to the capital ’s cultural life			0
close ties : @entity151 ( pictured ) , the @entity19 leader 's second wife , was born in @entity79 @entity108 made the cases for the pianos , upright and grand , which were becoming a must - have status symbol in every fashionable drawing - room , while @entity117 brought in extra money as a needlewoman and dressmaker			1
they lived in rented rooms in the teeming tenements close to the city ’s heart – close enough to the rich who employed them , but a world away			0
existing on a minimum wage and living in near - poverty , both were skilled workers making a positive contribution to the life and comfort of the social classes above them			0
‘ the @entity31 government of the day was operating what was effectively an open - door policy on immigrants , ’ says prof @entity132			1
‘ and though many @entity6 who came to @entity66 in the mid- 19th @entity182 were largely ignored , these people [ the @entity181 ] were skilled and will have been more positively received			0
’ what @entity108 would have made of his great - great - grandson ’s ‘ keep them out ’ rallying cry , one can only guess			1
after all , he and @entity117 came to @entity31 with no paper qualifications – in @entity4 ’s future @entity31 , they would be turned away			1
yet in his short life – he died before his 45th birthday – @entity108 was a model of what foreign labour can do to add to the wealth of the nation			0
he was no @entity197 camping on the streets but a man who worked so hard to make a new life for his family it sent him to an early grave			0
his only child , @entity204 , left school at 14 to become a telegraph messenger with the @entity207			0
@entity204 later changed his name to @entity209 and married an @entity51 girl , @entity210			2
the @entity211 of the family was completed in the next generation when their daughter @entity29 married a young stockbroker ’s clerk , @entity215			2
it would appear , the family was always determined to improve itself – never asking for help , never expecting it			0
@entity215 was the first white - collar worker in what was to become a relatively posh family			2
by the next generation the @entity225 had found out how to make money in the @entity227 and went about it with gusto			0
both sides of the family – schrods and @entity233 – are a proud illustration of how a flexible labour market can reward both the labourer and the country as a whole			0
but @entity4 seems determined to deny the past in his juggernaut journey to fame			2
in may at the launch of the @entity244 election campaign in @entity245 , he derided the ‘ mass ’ of people ‘ coming in and flooding the lower ends of the labour market in @entity31 ’ – doing , in fact , what his ancestors the @entity181 had done			1
and – come to that – the @entity225 had done too			0
the surname @entity4 , according to its owner , is of @entity257 origin			2
the @entity257 were members of the protestant church in @entity260 who fled in their tens of thousands from religious persecution			0
as many as 500,000 left the country in the late 16th and early 17th centuries , many of them settling in @entity31			2
as with the @entity181 , the @entity225 found no border controls , no government immigration policy , no racial or religious prejudice – nothing , in fact , but a peaceful country which welcomed them and encouraged them to work and make the best of their lives			0
they did not need to bring with them sheets of paper listing their qualifications			0
when told that @entity282 planned to publish an article on his @entity6 ancestry , mr @entity4 , said : ‘ i ’ve never made any secret of a variety of @entity289 links of the original derivation of my surname			1
’ however , he admitted he had failed to mention his @entity6 ancestors on his mother ’s side , despite being questioned on a regular basis about his @entity6 wife			1
‘ no , i have n’t , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s no reason why i should , is there ? yes , it is true that my great - great - grandfather was of germanic origin but he did n’t come from @entity6			1
because when he came to the @entity31 , @entity6 [ as a single state ] did n’t even exist			2
’ he added : ‘ on the basis of that , i ’m one - 32nd @entity6			0
‘ i have a great - great - grandfather of @entity308 origin			1
i do n’t regard it as a particularly big deal			0

@entity4 is standing for election on a no - unskilled foreigners ticket
he is yet to admit in public that he himself is the descendant of immigrants
his great - grandfather was born in @entity87 and moved to @entity51 in 1850s
he came with no qualifications and would be turned away in @entity4 ’s @entity31
the *headline* of an earlier *version* of this article referred to mr @entity4 ’s great grandfather . this has now been amended to indicate it is his great - great grandfather . the family tree that we published also *incorrectly* stated that mr @entity4 ’s mother was @entity334 , his father ’s second wife rather than @entity337 , his father ’s first wife . we have *apologised* for these mistakes .
