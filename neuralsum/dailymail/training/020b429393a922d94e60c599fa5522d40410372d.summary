@entity0 have been handed a major boost with the news that @entity3 will return to full training next month			1
manager @entity5 revealed on friday that the striker is three weeks ahead of schedule in his return from an ankle injury that has kept him sidelined since august 23			1
@entity3 was n't expected back until mid-december , but he may now be fit for first - team action as early as november 29 , when @entity0 visit @entity11			1
he 's three weeks ahead of schedule and i think he will join in normal training after the international break , ' said @entity5			1
' of course , it 's a big boost			2
he 's miles ahead of schedule			1
' @entity25 and @entity26 have carried @entity0 's goalscoring burden in @entity3 's absence			1
the @entity29 , in particular , has been in lethal form for the @entity31			2
and @entity5 heaped praise on his summer signing from @entity34 , saying the @entity36 's fighting qualities have ensured he 's hit the ground running during his first season in @entity40 football			2
he also compared the forward to one of his former transfer targets , @entity44			2
@entity45 faces a late fitness test on saturday could be out for @entity0 's game with @entity48 @entity49 faces a late fitness test ahead of @entity0 's game with @entity48 ' there are similarities , @entity44 sometimes gives the ball to the opponent but he gets it back straightaway , ' said @entity5			1
' @entity26 is the same , there is no time between offence and defence			0
they are very quick as well			0
' if you look across @entity60 , @entity36 is the only continent that develops strikers			0
we have to question ourselves , what can we add to our academies to develop strikers again ? ' they both played street football with friends			0
in street football when you are 10 , you play with 15 - year - olds so you have to be shrewd			0
you have to show that you are good , you have to fight , win impossible balls			0
' when it is all a bit more formulated then you develop less your individual skill , your fighting attitude			0
we have lost that a little bit in football			0
' @entity26 will be aiming to add to his impressive season tally of eight goals against @entity48 today			1
@entity5 is set to rest @entity82 , who still does n't feel 100 per cent after a hamstring problem			0
victory against the @entity48 could cut the deficit to league leaders @entity87 to six points			1
but while @entity5 admits chasing down @entity90 's side will be an uphill challenge , he insists his side are up to the task			0
@entity13 is making progress in his return from injury but will not play against @entity48 ' i wo n't write us off , let other people do that , ' said the @entity101			1
' it is a little bit linked with mathematics			0
it does n't consider who we played , how many times we played away , what is the quality of the team we played against , which missing players we had in the big games			1
that is absolutely normal but i have a strong belief we will come back and we can prove that on the pitch			1
' @entity87 are in a strong position at the moment			0
i believe it would not be realistic to think that we 'll catch @entity87 very quickly			0
' we have to get consistent results to get a chance to come back			2
personally , i 'm more focused on the quality of our games and on the consistency of our results , before we think about coming back on @entity87			2
