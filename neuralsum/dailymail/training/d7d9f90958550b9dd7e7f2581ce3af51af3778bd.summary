a tone - deaf teenager who suffered a concussion has astonished his family by suddenly being able to play music effortlessly			1
@entity4 , a high school junior from @entity5 , @entity6 , now plays 13 instruments - even though he has never learned to read music			1
but he did n't always have such a talent ; as a younger student he loved sport , dreamed on a career playing lacrosse - and had no passion for music			1
' he really had no talent , ' his mother @entity16 told @entity18			2
' i would say , " ca n't you hear what 's next ? " with something like " @entity23 " or " @entity24 " and he ’d say " no "			0
' i remember getting up and feeling really dazed , ' he told @entity18			0
' i did n't really understand something bad had happened			0
' the doctors told him he could return to the field , but he went on to suffer another couple of hard hits to the head , which sent him to hospital and caused him to suffer epileptic seizures			2
as his condition worsened , he started to hallucinate and doctors told him he should not play contact sports anymore - but there was one bizarre good side effect : his new - found musical talent			1
in hospital : he remained in hospital for weeks after taking knocks to the head during sports games @entity4 could be one of a handful of people around the world who have suffered a brain injury or head trauma and later woke up with amazing musical , artistic or mathematical abilities , known as acquired savant syndrome			1
while research into the cause is ongoing , there is no single theory explaining all savants			0
many researchers believe the underlying cause of savant syndrome occurs when the right brain compensates for an injury on the left brain			0
it is extremely rare for a savant to lose their skills after they have acquired them			0
he said he can now play as many as 13 instruments , including piano , guitar , mandolin , ukelele , harmonica , karimba and bagpipes - both @entity88 and @entity89 ones			1
' music is the thing that gets me up in the morning , ' he said			0
his mother called his playing ' absolutely beautiful '			0
his doctor , dr. @entity95 , said the theory is that the concussions switched on part of @entity4 's brain that had previously been dormant			1
' the thought is just a theory - that this was a talent laying latent in his brain and somehow was uncovered by his brain rewiring after the injury , ' he said			2
' clearly something happened in his brain and his brain had to recover from injury and change happened			0
and change may have uncovered this ability no one knew he had			0
' talent : before the accidents , he never understood music but now he plays 13 instruments with ease multi-talented : he shows the @entity18 reporter how to play the accordion , just one of his many instruments collection : he can also play the karimba , an @entity126 instrument which is known as the thumb piano theory : doctors said that the bumps to the head may have rewired his brain , unleashing the talent @entity4 no longer suffers seizures but told @entity18 that he found it comforting to know composer @entity136 had suffered from exactly the same type			1
the condition of suddenly developing a talent - musical , artistic or mathematical - is called acquired savant syndrome and is believed to occur when the right brain compensates for an injury on the left brain			2
last year , another @entity5 man , @entity144 , said that following a concussion after divig into a shallow pool , he could play eight instruments even though he 'd never had a lesson in his life .			1

@entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , never understood music until he suffered a concussion during a game in the 6th grade
he can now play 13 instruments - even though he can not read music
doctors believe his brain may have rewired , revealing the hidden talent
