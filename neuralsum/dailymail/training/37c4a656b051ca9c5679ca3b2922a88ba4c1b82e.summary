@entity0 expressed his bitter disappointment how an ill - tempered game was settled against @entity2 @entity0 feels referee @entity17 was subject to constant pressure and he has taken @entity19 - who has appeared on @entity20 to express his displeasure about the perceived ' campaign ' that @entity2 have endured this season - to task for how his squad behaved			1
unfortunately , the sending off really late on reflected the emphasis that the home team had in trying to influence the referee and take advantage of their role of playing at @entity6 , ' wrote @entity0			0
' @entity30 being booked after five minutes was a very loose way to referee a game and there was no need to show as many yellow cards as there were			0
@entity37 clashes with @entity38 as players tussle match between @entity2 and @entity5 ' but , more importantly , i never felt there was any consistency in judging every action equally between the two teams			2
