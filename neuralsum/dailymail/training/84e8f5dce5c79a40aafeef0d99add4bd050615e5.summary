by @entity0 published : 22:03 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 21:13 est , 8 march 2013 the oscar - winning actor called on lawmakers to tackle the ‘ curable problem ’ @entity5 is leading a campaign to ban free plastic bags across @entity8			1
the oscar - winning actor called on lawmakers to tackle the ‘ curable problem ’ as the @entity11 tabled proposals that could lead to a total ban by 2014			1
among the measures being considered are landfill bans , taxes and pay - as - you - throw schemes to encourage recycling			2
promoting his documentary trashed , which focuses on some of the world ’s most polluted places , @entity5 said plastic waste litters the most remote parts of the globe thanks to our ‘ throw - away ’ culture			1
he gave ‘ 100 per cent ’ backing to the @entity29 ’s @entity28 campaign , which calls on companies and politicians to reduce the number of plastic bags in our countryside and rivers			1
the actor said : ‘ i would like to see a government policy implemented of zero waste			2
in @entity41 , they have achieved 80 per cent recycling of all waste , so it is proven to be possible			0
‘ worldwide commodity prices are rising			0
it seems obtuse to bury or burn those commodities that could be reused at far less cost than producing them anew			0
’ @entity5 , 64 , said it would be much easier to cut the volume of plastic being produced , rather than finding ways to get rid of it			1
‘ i am an actor , not an environmentalist , but from what i have learned , i believe the construction of further incinerators in @entity59 is an unnecessary , costly and retro - gressive step , as well as being a danger to our collective health			1
’ @entity64 : of the some eight billion plastic bags used in @entity67 in 2011 , around two thirds ended up in landfill or being incinerated asked why he thought there were no restrictions on disposable plastic bags in @entity59 , he said : ‘ people are not yet aware of the seriousness of the problem			1
i hope trashed will allow people an insight on this quite curable but global problem			0
it will not be cured without the communal and political will to do so			0
’ shoppers are currently charged for plastic bags in @entity84 and @entity85 , where usage has dropped by up to 96 per cent			1
@entity87 is also implementing plans to charge for the bags			2
asked whether @entity59 should follow suit , @entity5 said : ‘ of course we should			1
it is eminently possible to change people ’s habits			0
it makes financial and environmental sense			0
’ despite a @entity99 promise to tackle the issue , 330million extra bags were handed out by shops in 2011			2
most are used for just minutes , but can harm wildlife for generations			0
the @entity29 ’s campaign , launched in 2008 , has won support from groups such as the @entity107 and the @entity108			0
@entity110 environment commissioner @entity109 said that recycling could protect resources			0
he said : ‘ managing plastic waste is a major challenge in terms of environmental protection , but it ’s also a huge opportunity for resource efficiency			2

governments will be ' encouraged ' to *introduce* charges or ban bags
