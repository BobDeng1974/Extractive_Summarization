mr @entity10 said the comment was part of ' office banter ' he also admitted calling mr @entity9 a ' c * * * sucker ' in a phone call to his wife , but said he was not his ' usual self ' that day as he had been at a coroner ’s inquest into the death of his father who had died in an accident months earlier			1

' mr @entity9 claimed colleagues were shocked when he told them about the @entity4 quip and that mr @entity10 started to ignore him from then on			1
he said he did n’t raise a formal grievance because his line manager was mr @entity10 ’ wife @entity22 , who is finance director at the firm based in @entity72 , @entity73			2

its fortunes have since improved			0
mr @entity9 , who was responsible for selling skip hire , had suffered a drop in sales and was called to a meeting with mrs @entity38 on may 14 to discuss his falling revenues			2
it was alleged that later that day he called mrs @entity38 a ' retard ' in a @entity40 post , which was seen by her husband			0
the couple claimed they decided not to take action against their employee at the time because she was not mentioned by name			0
however , mr @entity9 told the tribunal his online comment simply referred to him falling out with his drug - addicted brother - and was not about mrs @entity46			1
two weeks later , mr @entity9 was called back into @entity38 ’ office and informed he was at risk of redundancy because the company no longer needed a skip office manager			2

the tribunal , in @entity113 , @entity114 , heard office phone calls were recorded for training purposes and could be accessed by supervisors			0
mr @entity9 saved recordings of several key private conversations between the couple , and transcripts were put before employment judge @entity122 at the tribunal			2

no complaint was ever made			0
after mr @entity9 was informed he was at risk of redundancy on may 28 , the tribunal heard mr @entity10 phoned his wife to see how the meeting had gone			1
claims : mr @entity9 says @entity9 and mrs @entity38 had decided they wanted him to leave the company either because of his sexual orientation or his alleged misconduct he said that mr @entity10 had referred to him using the slur when he asked his wife about the meeting			1
' mrs @entity38 stated that i was " oh , so nice			0
you would not believe it , " and that i was " good as gold " in the meeting that day , ' he said			0
' that apparently surprised mr @entity10 who then commented , " do n’t they turn ? " presumably he was referring to homosexuals			2
' mr @entity9 , of @entity149 , @entity73 , left the office on june 3			2

' ' mr and mrs @entity38 had decided they wanted me to leave either because of my sexual orientation or my alleged misconduct , ' he claimed			0
' i could not stay in view of the homophobic comments made by mr @entity10 and the attempt to ease me out of the company on the false claim of redundancy			2
' mr @entity10 denied he was homophobic and dismissed mr @entity9 ’s claims that he had engineered the redundancy scheme to force him out of a job			1
referring to the @entity4 comment , mr @entity10 said : ' i saw @entity9 coming out of the toilet looking very pale and sweating			1
i asked him : " are you okay , @entity9 ? you do n’t look very well			0
" ' he laughed and replied that he was okay and then i asked him , jokingly : " @entity174 , @entity9 , you have n’t got @entity4 have you ? " ' with hindsight , i appreciate that this comment was inappropriate			1
however , this was a response to the way @entity9 looked and not a reference to his sexuality			0
' it was only afterwards that it occurred to me that the comment could be taken as a reference to @entity9 being gay			0
at the time , it was not calculated at all			0
' mr @entity10 said mr @entity9 did not raise a grievance and did not seem offended by his comment at the time			1
he said the office had a ' whimsical ' atmosphere and ' many of our employees like to have a laugh and partake in office banter			0
' turning to the comment about mr @entity9 made to his wife he added : ' i understand that this phrase is offensive and inappropriate but at the time i was extremely emotionally distressed and i was speaking - i thought in private - to my wife			1
' i regret my use of this phrase but i did not use it because of any prejudice against homosexuals , but rather as a general term of abuse			0
' this comment does not accurately reflect how i really viewed @entity9 or acted towards him			0
' giving evidence , mrs @entity38 said her husband ’s words to describe mr @entity9 was ' not deeply offensive in the world of transport			2
