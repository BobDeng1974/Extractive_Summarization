@entity0 is ready to welcome the selection headache he will be presented with when he is able to select from a fully - fit squad , as those who have thrived in previous weeks will have to maintain that level to stay in the side			2

' when you have a full squad to choose from then you have to make big decisions and you have to disappoint people if they are all fit			0
that 's what they have to accept			0
experienced attacking midfielder @entity12 is nearing a return to fitness ' if we all want to do better - even though you are disappointed if you are n't selected - then you have to accept it and wait for your time to go in and make sure you play at your best so it 's very difficult for me to leave you out			2
' despite wins over @entity47 , @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity2 are yet to record successive @entity35 wins this season and it is consistency that @entity0 is hoping will come in time - starting at @entity83 against newly - promoted @entity9			1
' i just want to see on saturday if the players have the mentality to show the same consistency as they have and whether they have got the right desire and determination to win back - to - back football matches for the first time this season , ' he said			0
playmaker @entity6 ( right ) is available for the trip to @entity9 this weekend ' that is their first test against a @entity9 side that are undoubtedly well - organised and make things very difficult , even if they have not won a game yet			2
