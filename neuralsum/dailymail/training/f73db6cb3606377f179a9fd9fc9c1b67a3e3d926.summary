by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 08:47 est , 6 january 2014 it 's no secret the @entity3 has steadily shifted its focus towards counter-terrorism since 9/11			2
but now the agency appears to have finally made its new priority official by quietly updating its mission statement			0
the bureau 's fact sheet has now replaced its decades - long ' primary function ' of ' law enforcement ' with ' national security ' to reflect reforms that have taken place over the last 12 years			1
the timing of the change , apparently made last summer , has prompted speculation by analysts that it has been influenced by the political climate			2
now in black and white : the @entity3 has changed its fact sheet to replace its primary function of ' law enforcement ' with ' national security ' to finally reflect reforms made since the september 11 attacks @entity3 historian and @entity28 professor @entity26 pointed to the negative publicity the agency received after failing to prevent the @entity31 in april last year			1
meanwhile , @entity33 - based national security lawyer @entity32 , who noticed the altered fact sheet last month , said the rebranding could bring the agency more power and money			1
he told foreign policy : ' if you tie yourself to national security , you get funding and you get exemptions on disclosure cases			2
' you get all the wonderful arguments about how if you do n't get your way , buildings will blow up and the country will be less safe			0
' political decision ? one observer pointed out that the change comes after the negative publicity the agency had received for failing to prevent the @entity31 ( above ) in april last year @entity32 spotted the change in a @entity55 response from the agency , each of which is accompanied by the fact sheet			1
between 2001 and 2009 , the @entity3 has doubled the number of agents dedicated to counter-terrorism , according to a inspector general report			0
conversely , that period has seen a decline in the number of criminal cases investigated nationally , particularly white - collar crimes			0
times of change : the @entity3 's headquarters in @entity33 the bureau has doubled the number of agents dedicated to counter-terrorism , leading to accusations that other law - enforcement areas are suffering the changes last month prompted criticism from @entity78 , the special agent in charge in @entity80 , who said he was being hampered in his efforts to combat violent crime that is rife in the city			0
@entity3 spokesman @entity84 declined to comment on the timing of the change			0
but he told foreign policy : ' when our mission changed after 9/11 , our fact sheet changed to reflect that ... so it is certainly accurate to say our primary function is national security			1

fact sheet altered in the summer of last year , says national security lawyer
@entity99 reflects reforms over last ten years , but analysts baffled by timing
came months after @entity3 was criticised for failing to foil @entity105 bombings
one observer says rebranding could bring agency more power and funding
