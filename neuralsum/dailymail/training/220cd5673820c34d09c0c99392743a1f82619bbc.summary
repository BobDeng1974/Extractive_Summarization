@entity0 find themselves outside the top four and unlikely to qualify for the group stages of the @entity3 after two games in four days at @entity5 in which they have failed to score against @entity7 and @entity8			2
@entity9 assesses how @entity10 can fix the problems currently afflicting the club			0
@entity14 's replacement you ca n't say @entity0 were n't warned the @entity16 would go one day			2
but by pebble - dashing their summer spending on a number of squad players instead of one a-lister , they 've come up short			2
with @entity24 injured , @entity23 has been tried as the main source of goals , and failed			1
but it 's not all the @entity29 's fault			2
asking him to make @entity32 - style runs in a free - flowing attack is like picking @entity34 for the @entity35 and telling him to compete in the 5,000metres			2
@entity23 's strength is his strength , feeling the defenders up against him and physically turning them			1
@entity10 must either leave @entity23 out or change @entity0 's style until @entity24 returns			1
even @entity40 would be a better bet			0
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity10 has to solve @entity23 's goal drought as he looks to replace the excellent @entity32 @entity23 has been tried as the main source of goals and failed at last year 's @entity46 runners up so far @entity47 leaving the defence stressed @entity47 makes an excellent sweeper - keeper in terms of having great feet for a goalkeeper			1
it 's the way many managers want to go in the modern game so that they play a high defensive line			2
unfortunately , @entity47 's deficiencies , not commanding his penalty area and questionable communication , have left the back - four jittery			1
@entity10 would be better off going back to basics and spending £ 10million on a traditional , strong goalkeeper like @entity62 , even if he is n't as good a footballer as @entity47			1
@entity47 's deficiencies have left @entity0 's back four shaken and the goalkeeper must turn it around @entity67 gerrard a fading force @entity69 can still dictate the tempo of the game when he 's allowed to			1
but opponents are n't stupid , they will try to find a way of capitalising on his lack of mobility at the age of 34			0
if @entity69 is going to play in front of the back - four , he needs legs alongside him – and that means @entity82 rather than @entity83 or @entity84			1
with @entity82 on the bench on saturday , it was noticeable how much more energy @entity8 had in their midfield , particularly @entity89			0
it was only after @entity82 came on that @entity69 burst into late life			1
@entity69 can still dictate the tempo of the game but only when the @entity0 captain is allowed to opponents seem to have sussed a way to limit the 34 - year - old @entity69 's lack of mobility for @entity0 the @entity98 ' crisis ' @entity98 arrived back from the @entity99 the great hope of @entity102 football			1
but for every great performance this season , and there have been some , there have also been patchy displays , an unwise link to @entity7 while contract negotiations are underway and claims from @entity112 manager @entity111 that the player had told him he was tired			0
at 19 , @entity98 is a good winger and a good no 10			0
but it 's too much for him to switch from one to another with regularity			0
for this season , @entity10 should tell @entity98 where he wants him to play – and stick to hit			0
there have been patchy displays by @entity98 so far and an unwise link to @entity126 giants @entity7 at 19 , @entity98 is a good winger and a good no 10 , but it 's too much for him to switch from one to another mixed - up style @entity0 's pattern of play was uncomplicated last season , and thrilling			1
@entity32 , @entity24 and @entity98 tore defences apart , @entity82 and @entity69 dictated the play , they scored more than the opposition			1
but @entity0 have lost a bit of their identity with the number of new signings made			0
the addition of the @entity3 means certain new signings like @entity143 have n't been given a run of matches to adjust to life at @entity5			0
it 's difficult because modern football requires some rotation but @entity10 should surely stick to his best xi for a few games at least to establish rhythm			0
then he can make changes			0
@entity0 's pattern of play was uncomplicated last season and thrilling but the new additions need to adjust the addition of the @entity3 means new signings like @entity143 have n't been given a run			0

opponents appear to have sussed how to keep @entity69 quiet
@entity23 has been tried as the main source of goals - and failed
@entity47 's jittery performances are leaving the back four on edge
