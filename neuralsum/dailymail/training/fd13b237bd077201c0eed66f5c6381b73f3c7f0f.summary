controversial plans have emerged to move the tomb of the @entity2 , @entity4 's second - holiest site			1
the @entity2 , born in 570 ad , is believed by @entity5 to be the last of @entity8 's prophets to mankind who delivered the religion 's final revelation			1
his resting place in @entity13 , @entity14 is visited by millions of @entity5 every year and is seen as the second holiest site after the @entity16 , the famous black cubed building in @entity18			1
but it emerged last night that a @entity14 academic has put forward contentious plans to have the @entity2 's remains moved from the tomb over fears by some scholars that the site is leading to idolatry			1
proposals to move the @entity2 's remains threaten to spark discord across the @entity5 world the tomb of the @entity2 could be moved from the @entity30 mosque in @entity13 , @entity14 , where it is currently housed , under plans reported today according to the @entity38 , a 61 - page document has been circulated among the supervisors of the holy site proposing that the @entity2 's body be moved to the nearby @entity42 , where it would be interred anonymously			1
dr @entity44 , director of the @entity45 , told the newspaper : ' they want to prevent pilgrims from attending and venerating the tomb because they believe this is " shirq " , or idolatry			2
' but the only way they can stop people visiting the @entity2 is to get him out and into the cemetery			0
' @entity55 , known as ' shirq ' in the @entity45 faith , is the worship of objects or saints and is forbidden in the faith			0
there is no suggestion that @entity14 's @entity63 , who is the site 's formal custodian , nor the supervisors of the @entity30 mosque which contains the tomb have agreed to the idea			1
the @entity14 government has previously insisted it treats the development of holy sites with ' the utmost seriousness '			2
@entity2 it is feared any plans to move the prophet 's remains could cause anger among some @entity5 in the region but it is feared the emergence of plans , which spring from a reform movement known as @entity84 , could divide @entity5 , with both @entity85 and @entity86 thought to be opposed			1
dr @entity44 told the @entity38 : ' @entity2 's grave is venerated by the mainstream @entity85 , who would never do it			0
it is just as important for the @entity86 too , who venerate the @entity2 's daughter , @entity93			0
' i 'm sure there will be shock across the @entity5 world at these revelations			2
' violence in @entity103 and the rise of the radical @entity105 , or @entity106 , organisation has already strained tensions between @entity85 and @entity86 in the region			0
the tomb of the @entity2 is seen as the second most important site for @entity5 after the @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity14			1
the @entity16 - which is said to have been built by @entity111 - is at the centre of the @entity113 , which @entity5 always face to pray			0
it is religious duty for those who follow the faith to visit the @entity16 at least once during their lifetime			0
millions of pilgrims gather to circle the building during the hajj , a huge five - day pilgrimage to the site each year			0
the tomb of the @entity2 is second only to the @entity16 in its importance for the world 's @entity5 many of those visiting the site also take the opportunity to visit @entity2 's tomb , which about 200miles to the north in @entity13			1
the tomb dates back to the seventh century , when @entity2 was buried , and also includes the resting places of early @entity5 leaders @entity136 and @entity137			2
