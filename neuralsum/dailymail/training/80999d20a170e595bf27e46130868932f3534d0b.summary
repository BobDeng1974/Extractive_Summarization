the ex-wife of an @entity2 oil magnate who was awarded the second biggest divorce settlement ever in the @entity5 has turned down a personal check for $ 974.8 million on tuesday as she continues to fight for more money			1
@entity8 has appealed the ruling made last month in an @entity11 , @entity2 courtroom , citing 78 alleged errors and missteps that caused a judge to grossly undervalue her stake in the vast oil fortune of @entity17			1
she slammed the court 's ruling as ' inappropriate ' and ' not fair ' , believing her ex-husband is worth an estimated $ 18 billion			1
@entity22 's offer to pay ex-wife @entity8 immediately the full cash value of what he owes based on the november divorce ruling was rejected , @entity22 's lawyer , @entity21 , said in an emailed statement			1
her lawyers claim he is worth about $ 18 billion ' ms. @entity8 , through her counsel , stated that they were rejecting the ... payment because ms. @entity8 did not want to risk the dismissal of her appeal by acceptance of the benefits , ' @entity21 wrote to @entity54			1
@entity22 founded @entity55 in 1967 and @entity8 was an executive at the company			2
the couple were married 26 years but never signed a prenuptial agreement			0
@entity22 had already paid his former wife more than $ 20 million during the divorce proceedings			1
@entity8 has taken ownership of the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $ 14.7million , along with the couple 's two of their @entity2 properties , as per the court 's ruling			1
mr. @entity17 will take their $ 750,000 home in @entity74 , @entity75 and a $ 300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in @entity77 , @entity2			2
@entity8 made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued			0
the only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the @entity5 was @entity82 , who reportedly received $ 2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband @entity83 in 1999			1
real estate portfolio : miss @entity8 also picked up three properties in the divorce , including this home in @entity89 , @entity2 relaxed living : the @entity89 home has been valued at $ 800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in @entity2 all good ? : miss @entity94 's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce miss @entity94 stated that she felt that the decision by judge @entity99 to allow lawyers for both her husband and for @entity55 to be involved in the proceedings was ' inappropriate ' in that it allowed them to ' double team ' her			1
the crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and mr. @entity17 made beginning in 1988 , the year he and @entity106 were married			0
during the trial it was argued that @entity55 ’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors , such as rising oil prices , and , under @entity2 law , only the ' active ' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division			2
miss @entity8 ’s lawyers contend however that @entity123 miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $ 14billion rise in the value of mr. @entity17 's @entity55 shares during the marriage - 6 percent			1
' as @entity8 has stated previously , 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage , and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal , ' her legal team said in a statement			2
the mansion : miss @entity94 also got the couple 's second @entity2 home located in @entity143 and worth $ 4.6million big growth : during the course of their marriage , mr. @entity17 's company 's worth jumped from $ 50million to $ 20billion miss @entity8 , who worked as a lawyer for @entity55 when she and mr. @entity17 married , and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company , also claims that @entity123 undervalued her own contributions to the couple ’s wealth			1
most estimates have stated that @entity55 was worth around $ 50million in 1988 when the couple married , which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $ 20billion behemoth it is today			0
a behemoth that mr. @entity17 has a 68 percent stake in , a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be ' separate property			0
' all this , combined with lingering timeline questions presented by @entity106 that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple 's 1988 wedding , will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years			0
and there 's somehow more			0
that aforementioned $ 9billion fortune of mr. @entity17 's was in fact a $ 20billion fortune as recently as august , with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil			2
started from the bottom : mr. @entity17 was born one of 13 children to a sharecropper working his way up : he pumped gas when he was 20 and slowly saved up his money to drill his first well filing for divorce in march 2013 , miss @entity8 alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair , citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage			2
mr. @entity17 had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world , a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the @entity5 dream			2
born one of 13 children to a sharecropper , mr. @entity17 worked his way up , picking cotton as a child , pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well			0
and while mr. @entity17 , who was previously married and has three children from that union , is no fan of the spotlight , he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years			0
in 2012 , mr. @entity17 became a big part of @entity222 's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser , a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $ 985,000 to the @entity226			0
mr. @entity17 also hosted a fundraiser at his $ 4.6 million @entity228 , @entity2 mansion for the @entity231 candidate , which raised more than $ 2million			1
it is worth noting that the @entity143 mansion is no longer mr. @entity17 's but , along with a $ 800,000 home in @entity89 , @entity2 , the property of @entity106			1
big score : in 2012 , mr. @entity17 was one of the select few named to the @entity238 , an event he attended with his wife friends in high places : 2012 was also the year mr. @entity17 became an adviser for the @entity222 campaign it was also in early 2012 that mr. @entity17 earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the @entity238 for that year			0
he and his wife attended the ceremony together that april in @entity249 that also honored , among others , @entity252 , supreme court associate justice @entity253 , president @entity254 and @entity255			0
the two posed on the red carpet together , smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another , looking happy and excited			0
miss @entity8 would file for divorce less than a year later .			0

@entity8 has appealed the $ 1billion payout she received in her divorce from her ex-husband , @entity2 oil magnate @entity17
she rejected a check for $ 974.8 million tuesday so it did *n't* affect her appeal case
@entity8 claims there were 78 errors in the divorce settlement
lawyers claim @entity22 is actually worth about $ 18 billion
she also received a $ 14.7 million @entity64 ranch and two @entity2 homes valued at $ 4.6 million and $ 800,000
the settlement is the second highest ever in the @entity5 , after the $ 2.5billion reportedly received by @entity82 in 1999
