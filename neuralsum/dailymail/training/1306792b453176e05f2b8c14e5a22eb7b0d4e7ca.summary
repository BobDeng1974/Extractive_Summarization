by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 11:00 est , 30 october 2012 @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has suggested the 35 - hour working week is not sacrosanct and said the nation needs to be re-started to ' fire on all cylinders '			1
his controversial comments came ahead of a government - commissioned report to be unveiled next monday on proposals to boost the flagging industrial competitiveness of @entity12 's second largest economy			2
however , only hours after his comments were published , mr @entity1 's own labour minister dismissed the suggestion , and leading trade unions also voiced their opposition too			1
all cylinders ? @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has suggested the 35 - hour working week is not sacrosanct and said the nation needs to be re-started to ' fire on all cylinders ' the 35 - hour working week was first adopted in @entity2 in february 2000 under prime minister @entity24 's @entity23 government			1
the previous legal duraction of the working week was 39 hours , established by @entity26			2
the 35 hours is the legal standard limit , after which further working time was to be considered overtime			0
the aim was to reduce unemployment and stop some people working long hours while others were unemployed			0
it was also aimed at giving workers more time to enjoy their lives			0
the law has always rankled with the right but when @entity40 came to power in 2007 he was content to tinker with the legislation rather than scrap it			0
average working week in @entity12 ( @entity44 ) @entity45 : 43.7 @entity46 : 43.7 @entity47 : 42.7 @entity48 : 42 @entity49 : 41.6 @entity2 : 41.1 @entity50 : 40.5 @entity51 : 39.7 @entity52 : 39.1 the shift to a shorter working week was the flagship reform of the @entity56 government that ruled @entity2 during a boom at the end of the 1990s			1
many employers say it bloated labour costs and blunted their ability to compete in world markets			0
asked if it could make sense to revert to a working week of 39 hours , @entity1 told @entity66 newspaper : ' nothing 's taboo			1
i 'm not dogmatic ... the only thing that worries me is that @entity2 has broken down and we need to restart with the engine firing on all cylinders			0
' @entity1 , whose five - month - old government has been criticised for a string of communications gaffes , clarified his remarks after business and union leaders seized on them as signalling a major policy shift			2
' i said nothing was taboo			0
but this is simply not a cause the government advocates			0
there will be no rolling back on the 35 - hour week because it is not the cause of our difficulties , ' he told @entity2 radio			2
@entity94 , head of the @entity96 employers federation , had earlier hailed @entity1 's initial comments as ' excellent news ' while trade union leaders were up in arms			1
public and private sector workers demonstrate during a protest march in @entity103 , january 29 , 2009 public transport workers demonstrate carrying a banner which reads ' together for @entity106 , work , retiring , social protection and services ' in @entity110 in 2007 ' if the government tries to take on the 35 - hour week , it will run into us on the road , ' @entity111 , head of the large @entity113 labour union warned			2
the gradual introduction of the shorter working week was intended as a socially progressive move and to encourage employers to hire more staff by making higher overtime costs kick in after an employee had worked 35 hours in a given week			1
@entity40 , the conservative president unseated in may by @entity124 , offered overtime tax breaks to lessen the impact of the measure but did not try to repeal it			0
@entity1 stressed the @entity56 government had no plans to change the current working week .			1

hours after @entity1 's comments were published , his own labour minister dismissed the suggestion
the shift to a shorter working week was the flagship reform of the @entity56 government that ruled @entity2 during a boom at the end of the 1990s
