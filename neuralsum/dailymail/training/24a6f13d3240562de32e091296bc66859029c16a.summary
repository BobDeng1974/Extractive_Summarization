the cosy relationship between @entity6 and his local force involved regular friday coffee morning chats with officers at his flat in @entity20 , along with invitations to a vip lunch with senior officers and to open a police station gymnasium			1
despite police being contacted by @entity27 colleagues in 2007 about a sexual abuse inquiry involving @entity6 , he was still used the following year to front two crime prevention campaigns in his home city			1
@entity6 even offered the use of his home to police controlling crowds at a @entity36 concert in a nearby park , the report revealed			1

@entity6 himself recalled an incident in his personal diary of how a police officer visited his club in @entity20 one night and spoke to him about a teenage girl ‘ absconder ’			1
if she turned up he promised to return the girl but ‘ keep her all night first as a reward ’			0
@entity6 wrote that he did take her to police the next day and implied officers failed to challenge him because of his close relationship with the force			1
the report team could find ‘ no records ’ to back this account			0
celebrity : police used @entity6 's fame to promote their publicity campaigns even after accusations the report concluded : ‘ there is no evidence that he was protected from arrest or prosecution for any offences as a result of his relationship with @entity2 , or individual friendships with officers			1
’ the review team ‘ did find mistakes were made in how @entity2 recorded and handled some intelligence relating to @entity91 ’ , and added : ‘ @entity2 has been unable to fully establish all the facts			1
’ although several matters have been referred to the @entity97 , several of @entity6 ’s victims condemned the 59 - page report			1
a 52 - year - old man , who was attacked by @entity6 when he was a teenager , said : ‘ there is clearly a cover - up going on			2
' the police knew what was happening and were protecting him at the time			0
‘ the police are now running around like headless chickens trying to appear as though they are acting on these allegations but the fact of the matter is something should have been done a long time ago			0
‘ i hope no one believes for a second what is published in that report			0
it ’s a complete whitewash			0
’ a 56 - year - old woman , who @entity6 tried to rape at a party when she was 19 , said : ‘ as far as i ’m concerned the report is nothing more than a bag of lies			2
' i find it impossible to believe it was n’t covered up by those he worked with and by the police			0
’ @entity126 , a lawyer representing 40 victims , accused police of having ‘ collective myopia ’ and said the report ‘ does n’t add up ’			1
@entity132 assistant chief constable @entity131 admitted police had ‘ let the victims down			2
’ she added : ‘ the police are not infallible , the police are human beings			0
’ host : many officers attended coffee mornings at @entity6 's flat in @entity20 , the report said nine of @entity6 's @entity132 victims were under 10 at the time and one of them was only five			1
as part of today 's report , @entity2 analysed the characteristics of the 68 victims who have come forward in the force area so far			1
these victims have reported 76 crimes between them , 72 of them taking place in @entity91 's home city of @entity20			1
the youngest victim was five and the eldest was 45			0
the report said nine victims were under 10 ; nine victims were 10 to 13 years old ; 30 were aged 14 to 17 ; and 20 were adults			2
of the 68 complainants , 49 were female and 19 were male			0

honour : savile in 1996 after being knighted by the @entity181 for his broadcasting and charity work investigation : @entity131 took charge of the review of @entity6 's relationship with @entity2 @entity6 's details were recorded as part of the hunt to find the @entity192 , in the 1970s , but no evidence has been found that he was a ' person of interest ' to the inquiry			1
questions were raised about the broadcaster 's relationship with the @entity192 investigation last year when a retired senior officer claimed the disgraced @entity200 was a suspect in the notorious case more than 30 years ago			2
but today 's report from @entity2 concluded it could find no evidence of this being true			1
the review found that many records have been destroyed , but detectives had found huge numbers of record cards with information about thousands of men who had been spoken to			0
the report said : ' searches of the paperwork relating to the investigation have identified four index cards relating to @entity91			2
they contain scant information and do not indicate whether @entity6 was a " person of interest " to the enquiry team			2
' the information held was his name , date of birth , home address and various reference numbers			0
it was not possible to establish the relevance of the reference numbers as a large proportion of the investigation paperwork had been destroyed in the 1980s			0
' but the review said : ' one card does make reference to @entity91 offering his services as an intermediary for the police , should the " @entity192 " wish to make contact			2

@entity2 report claims police did not protect @entity91
but one officer said @entity6 ' gets so many of these type of complaints '
police would attend ' @entity248 ' meetings at @entity6 's home
victims ' lawyer attacks police report saying , ' it does *n't* add up '
