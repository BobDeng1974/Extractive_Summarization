many of the current security procedures in place by banks are good , but they 're not foolproof - anyone could theoretically access your account if they had your debit card , password and so on			1
but mimicking someone 's voice is much more difficult , and it 's for that reason many banks are now turning in that direction to provide added security			2
known as voice biometrics , the technology means that only your voice can access your bank on the phone - and it 's something that could soon make its way to the general public			1
an investigation found that banks are quietly rolling out voiceprinting			1
the biggest roll - out is in @entity27 , while the @entity28 and @entity29 are following suit			1
in this photo @entity31 , a speech scientist with a voice recognition technology company @entity34 , points to a screen displaying the voice biometric features of a telephone call in an investigation by @entity42 for the @entity43 , it was revealed that businesses and even governments are increasingly turning to voiceprints			2
this is apparently being used by some when people pay pensions , collect taxes , track criminals , replace passwords and more			2
but the technology is not being well - communicated to customers , with the roll - out seemingly taking place behind closed doors			1
vendors say the timbre of a person 's voice is unique in a way similar to the patterns at the tips of someone 's fingers			1
the shape of your vocal cavities and the way you move your mouth makes your voice unique - more so even than a fingerprint			1
a voiceprint system uses something known as a spectrogram to veryify the identity of your voice			2
by speaking a given phrase , a person 's voice is mapped on a spectrogram			2
this measures the pitch of their voice with the time taken to speak			0
different voices create different spectrograms , so a person 's voice can be matched with a previously spoken phrase			2
many modern systems can separate someone 's voice from background noise , so being in a busy environment wo n't make identification impossible			0
and even if the speaker is ill or tired so their speech sounds different , most systems can still identify their voice and verify it with that stored in the database			1
voiceprint technology measures the characteristics of a person 's speech			1
typical speaker recognition software compares those characteristics with data held on a server			0
if two voiceprints are similar enough , the system declares them a match			0
' there 's a misconception that the technology we have today is only in the domain of the intelligence services , or the domain of " @entity121 , " ' said @entity122 , of @entity123 - based @entity34 , a voice biometric vendor			2
' the technology is here today , well - proven and commonly available			2
' @entity126 , an analyst with @entity127 in @entity128 , estimates that the industry 's revenue will roughly double from just under £ 250 million ( $ 400 million ) last year to up to £ 560 million ( $ 900 million ) next year			0
@entity131 recently experimented with voiceprinting as an identification for its wealthiest clients			0
it was so successful that @entity131 is rolling it out to the rest of its 12 million retail banking customers			1
' the general feeling is that voice biometrics will be the de facto standard in the next two or three years , ' said @entity141 , a @entity131 executive			0
an @entity43 investigation has found that two of @entity28 's biggest retail banks , @entity144 and @entity145 , are quietly taking some callers ' voiceprints to fight fraud			1
vendors say the timbre of a person 's voice is unique in a way similar to the patterns at the tips of someone 's fingers the @entity158 , a @entity160 - based mutual fund manager , is among the technology 's many financial users			1
tens of thousands of customers log in to their accounts by speaking the phrase : ' at @entity158 , my voice is my password ' into the phone			1
' we 've done a lot of testing , and looked at siblings , even twins , ' said executive @entity175 , whose voice was a bit hoarse during a telephone interview			0
' even people with colds , like i have today , we looked at that			0
' the single largest implementation identified by the @entity43 is in @entity27 , where mobile phone company @entity184 has taken the voice biometric data of some 10 million customers using technology provided by market leader @entity188 however many others are rolling out their own versions			1
some speech recognition technology is already noticeable in modern society , such as @entity194 's @entity193 ( stock image shown )			0
however , speech recognition may become more ubiquitous as banks and companies prefer it to other mans of identification like a password in the @entity28 , law enforcement officials use the technology to monitor inmates and track offenders who have been paroled			1
in @entity208 , the @entity207 celebrated its 1 millionth voiceprint , leading the revenue minister to boast that his country had ' the highest level of voice biometric enrollments per capita in the world			0
' in @entity216 , roughly 7 million voiceprints have been collected by the country 's @entity217 , in part to verify that those claiming pensions are still alive			0
some activists worry that the popularity of voiceprinting has a downside , though			0
' it 's more mass surveillance , ' said @entity227 , an @entity228 privacy researcher			0
' the next thing you know , that will be given to border guards , and you 'll need to speak into a microphone when you get back from vacation			0
' however it seems that for now voiceprinting will become ever more ubiquitous in the coming years .			0

@entity238 found that banks are quietly rolling out voiceprinting
the biggest roll - out is in @entity27 , while the @entity28 and @entity29 are following suit
a voiceprint allows a person to be identified by their speech alone
it is like a fingerprint but apparently can be even more unique
the technique is being used to verify customers on the phone
