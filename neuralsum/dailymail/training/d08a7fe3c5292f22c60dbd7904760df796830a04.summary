by @entity0 a hairdresser with a rare brain tumour claims she is plagued by robotic voices similar to @entity4			1
@entity5 was terrified of the @entity7 characters as a child , but now whenever someone speaks to the mother - of - three , she hears the tinny sounds			1
the 46 - year - old noticed something was wrong when she started to lose her hearing in april 2012			1
she started to suffer constant ringing in her left ear , making it harder to hear her customers while she was cutting their hair			1
@entity5 is plagued by robotic sounds similar to @entity4 from the programme @entity7 , after being diagnosed with a rare brain tumour the mother - of - three was terrified of the @entity7 characters as a child , but is now surrounded by noises resembling @entity4 every day whenever someone speaks to her months later she claims she started to hear robotic sounds every time someone spoke to her			1
mrs @entity5 , who was also suffering from pain all over her body , was first diagnosed with fibromyalgia - a long - term painful condition			1
but when she began to lose her balance , she went back to her gp and was referred for an mri scan			0
it revealed the hairdresser had an extremely rare brain tumour , called an acoustic neuroma			1
doctors have managed to shrink the tumour and are hoping they can keep it under control , concerned about the risks if they had to operate			2
but her balance and hearing will be affected for the rest of her life and she has been forced to quit her job			2
mrs @entity5 , of @entity48 , @entity49 , said : ' i had a constant ringing in my left ear and everyone sounded like @entity4			1
' i was terrified of the @entity4 as a child and i used to have to run and hide under my bed			2
now i have to hear them all the time			0
' it was bearable because i still had my good ear			0
but if i blocked the right ear , it genuinely sounded like i was in an episode of dr who - it made me think i was going deaf			2
' for a while when i put my phone on my ear i just thought it was a constant bad line and i even changed my phone			0
' but when she began stumbling and suffering from poor balance , she knew something was wrong			0
the 46 - year - old has had gamma knife radiosurgery , where blasts of radiation are directed at the tumour to stop it growing while the head is held tightly in a clamp , pictured ' it was like i was constantly on a boat , ' she said			1
' i was told it was an acoustic lesion , or an acoustic neuroma , and i laughed , i did n’t know what it was			1
' i googled it and found out it was , thankfully , the least deadly tumour you can have			0
' a neuroma is a growth of tissue which is not usually cancerous			0
but when it is an acoustic neuroma it can lead to other life - changing symptoms			1
an acoustic neuroma is a benign non-cancerous tumour in the brain			1
it growns on the acoustic nerve , which helps to control hearing and balance			1
the acoustic nerve runs alongside the facial nerve , which carries information from the brain to face muscles			2
a small acoustic neuroma can cause problems with : a larger tumour can cause multiple symptoms , including : every year around 20 people in every million in the population are diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma			1
they tend to be more common in women than men and those aged between 40 and 60 years old are most often affected			0
after a ' watch and wait ' programme , doctors noticed her balance had become significantly worse and her tumour was rapidly growing			2
mrs @entity5 , who is mother to @entity123 , 20 , @entity124 , 19 , and @entity125 , 14 , underwent gamma knife radiosurgery at the @entity127 in january 2014			0
the procedure involves blasts of direct radiation to the tumour to stop it growing while the head is held tightly in a clamp			0
thankfully , mrs @entity5 was told at the end of last month the tumour is shrinking and she can get her life back on track as her symptoms lessen			2
unfortunately doctors told her that despite the tumour shrinking her balance and hearing will be affected for the rest of her life			2
she is now struggling to look after @entity123 , who suffers from syringomyelia - a cyst in her spinal chord which leaves her bound to a wheelchair			0
mrs @entity5 , who lives with husband @entity148 , 46 , said : ' it seems to have improved since i was told it was shrinking , a hearing aid has stopped the ringing and i ’m able to stand and move around			1
' unfortunately everyone still sounds like a dalek but i will just have to get used to that			0
' the tumour is benign lbut it ’s just on the edge of my brain stem so it ’s going to be watched very closely			1
' if it does seem to suddenly start growing i will have to have surgery , and with it being so close to the brain it could leave me paralysed facially			0
' it shows brain tumours come in many different disguises and i had no idea that something like a hearing problem could be the sign of one			0
' mrs @entity5 , who now relies on walking stick to get around , is starting a university degree in humanities in october despite her condition			0
she is raising money for the @entity178 , by taking part in a number of fundraising pamper days , where her friends will provide massages , and manicures .			0
