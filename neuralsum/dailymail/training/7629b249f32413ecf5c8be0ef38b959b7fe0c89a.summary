apart from @entity3 health and safety guidelines , that is			1
professor @entity1 has told how corporation bosses blocked his plans to try to make contact with a newly discovered planet – just in case some aliens happened to answer back			0
the physicist and tv host claimed they were worried the experiment , to be staged live on air during his hit @entity25 show stargazing live , might pick up a signal from ‘ an alien civilisation ’ – which is apparently a breach of corporation guidelines			0
he had hoped to point a radio telescope at @entity30 , the planet discovered by amateur stargazers during a project publicised on his show			0
the telescope , based at @entity38 ’s @entity37 , picks up radio emission from planets			0
but the experiment never went ahead for fear it would breach health and safety regulations , prof @entity1 claimed yesterday in a radio interview on @entity46			0
‘ we decided that we ’d point the @entity37 telescope at the planet that had been discovered by these two viewers and listen because no one had ever pointed a radio telescope at it and you never know , ’ he recalled			0
‘ the @entity3 actually said , “ but you ca n’t do that because we need to go through the regulations and health and safety and everything in case we discover a signal from an alien civilisation ”			1
‘ ( i said ) , “ you mean we would discover the first hint that there is other intelligent life in the universe beyond @entity69 , live on air , and you ’re worried about the health and safety of it ? ” it was incredible			2
’ an artist 's impression of @entity30 - where @entity3 bosses feared potential inhabitants might breach health and safety @entity46 ’s breakfast show host @entity83 was incredulous at his guest ’s claim			2
‘ the idea that intelligent life could be discovered and it might swear and that ’s why we would n’t broadcast it – it ’s such a brilliant @entity3 thing , is n’t it ? ’ he said			1
prof @entity1 also said he had a second bizarre encounter with @entity3 bosses during the show when he suggested asking volunteers to scour pictures of @entity97 for signs of geological activity that computer scrutiny might have missed			1
‘ someone from the @entity3 said to me , “ would there have to be a prize if someone discovered it ? ” ‘ ( i said ) , “ what do you mean ? you ’re going to say to someone , you discovered the first evidence for alien life beyond @entity69 – and here ’s a book voucher as well ? @entity114 ' @entity113 ' @entity112 made the discovery of the new galaxy as part of an online search led by the @entity3 's @entity120 programme			1
the show is hosted by professor @entity1 ( left ) and @entity123 ( right ) ‘ “ you think that ’s going to make it better ? you ’re going to go down in history with a @entity127 – book tokens or @entity130 points ? ” ’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ in making the series there were many light - hearted conversations , one of which was about how different organisations might react to the discovery of alien life			1

@entity30 was discovered during the show in january by amateur scientists @entity146 and @entity147			0
in what is believed to be only the third time @entity151 amateurs have found a new planet , they made their discovery by spotting changes in light patterns in an image from @entity158 ’s kepler space telescope .			2

stargazer live presenter poked *fun* at @entity162 for their *cautious* *approach* to significant discovery
