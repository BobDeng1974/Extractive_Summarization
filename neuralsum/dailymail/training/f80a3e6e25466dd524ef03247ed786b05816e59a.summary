a report from the @entity8 said this was thanks to better access to drugs that can both treat and prevent the incurable human immunodeficiency virus ( @entity6 ) that causes @entity2			1
this meant the aim of ending the @entity2 epidemic was not ' merely visionary ' but ' entirely feasible			2
' a researcher in @entity17 working on a project for a hiv vaccine : some eight million people were being treated with @entity2 drugs by the end of 2011 some 34 million people had @entity6 at the end of 2011			1
worldwide , the number of people newly infected with the disease , which can be transmitted via blood and by semen during sex , is falling			0
at 2.5 million , the number of new infections in 2011 was 20 per cent lower than in 2001			1
deaths from @entity2 also fell to 1.7 million in 2011 , down from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005 and from 1.8 million in 2010			1
the report said this allowed the ' foundation to be laid for the eventual end of @entity2			2
' in 2012 , over 100,000 people are living with @entity6 in the @entity38			0
of these , a quarter do not know they are carrying the virus			0
however , @entity41 is the most severely affected region with almost one in every 20 adults infected , nearly 25 times the rate in @entity45			0
there are also almost five million people with @entity6 in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity45 combined			0
' although @entity2 remains one of the world 's most serious health challenges , global solidarity in the @entity2 response during the past decade continues to generate extraordinary health gains , ' the report said			2
it said this was due to ' historic success ' in bringing @entity6 programmes to scale , combined with the emergence of new combination drugs to prevent people from becoming @entity6 infected and from dying from @entity2			2
since 1995 , @entity2 drug treatment - known as antiretroviral therapy - has saved 14 million life - years in poorer countries , including 9 million in @entity41 , the report said			1

a quarter of people in the @entity38 with @entity6 do n't know they have it some eight million people were being treated with @entity2 drugs by the end of 2011 , a 20-fold increase since 2003			1
the @entity8 has set a target to raise that to 15 million people by 2015			0
scientific studies published in recent years have shown that getting timely treatment to those with @entity6 can also cut the number of people who become newly infected with the virus			0
@entity86 said the sharpest declines in new hiv infections since 2001 were in the @entity89 and in @entity41 - where new infections were down 25 per cent in a decade			1
despite this , @entity41 still accounted for 71 per cent of people newly infected in 2011 , underscoring the need to boost @entity6 prevention efforts in the region , @entity86 said			0
@entity6 trends are also a concern in other regions			0
since 2001 , the number of new hiv infections in the @entity101 and @entity102 was up more than 35 percent from 27,000 to 37,000 , it said , and evidence suggests hiv infections in @entity105 and @entity106 began increasing in the late 2000s after being relatively stable for several years .			1

at 2.5 million , the number of new infections in 2011 was 20 per cent lower than in 2001
deaths from @entity2 also fell to 1.7 million in 2011 , down from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005
