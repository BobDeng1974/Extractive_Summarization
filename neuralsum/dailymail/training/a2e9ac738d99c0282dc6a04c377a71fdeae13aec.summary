@entity7 , 40 , from @entity8 puts up thousands of @entity4 lights every year on september 1			1
he says as well as being nice to look at , the bulbs emit so much warmth he can switch his central heating off well into january			1
how festive ! @entity7 puts up thousands of @entity4 lights around his home every year on september 1 cheaper living ? mr @entity7 , from @entity14 , says he can turn off his central heating from september as the bulbs emit so much heat they keep his whole house warm mr @entity7 said : ' despite having thousands of lights up i find they 're cheaper to power than my heating			1
' they 're about the equivalent of powering a 3kw fire			2
' once the lights are on for a while the place is like a sauna			2
' i leave the doors open so the heat circulates through the house			0
' later on in winter , if it 's really cold in the morning , i 'll put the lights on first thing to warm the place up			0
mr @entity7 , who has thrombosis of the legs and is unable to work , continued : ' i put £ 15 a week on my electricity key card and £ 15 a fortnight on my gas card , which pays for my cooker and central heating			1
lit up : the man puts around 700 lights on his christmas tree alone , and thousands more around his house ' i try to spend only around a fiver on my gas at this time of year and that 's just for cooking , allowing the money to build up			1
' once i take the lights down after @entity4 there will hopefully be enough on the gas card to pay for my heating into the spring			1
' i really do n't know how these heating companies expect people on low incomes to survive			0
for older people , it 's heat or eat			0
' i stock up two big chest freezers whenever i can so i have emergency supplies of food when needed			0
' these days i usually get money for @entity4 presents and put it straight on to the meter cards			2
you just do what you have to do			0
' mr @entity7 said his love of @entity4 lights started when he was a young boy			1
memories : mr @entity7 's love of lights comes from his father only allowing one set on the family 's tree he said : ' my father only allowed one set on the tree and i told myself when i was old enough i would find as many lights as i could and put them up			1
' i go around charity shops collecting old sets			0
i love fiddling with the lights and fixing them			0
' i have 700 lights on the christmas tree alone and thousands more around the room - on the walls , window , hanging from the ceiling			2
if i could put them on the floor , i would			0
' it takes me a couple of days just to get all of the tangles out and then my friend puts them up for me			2
until next time : the lights all come down in january , by which time mr @entity7 says he has saved enough money on his gas card to last him through until spring ' everyone thinks i 'm mad but i do n't care			1
the neighbours have come to expect it now			0
' my mum stays around the corner and she knows if i 'm in because you can see the lights from a distance			0
' they put me in a great mood , i love them			0
i could stare at the lights all year round but i take them down on january 3 - it 'd look stupid otherwise			1
