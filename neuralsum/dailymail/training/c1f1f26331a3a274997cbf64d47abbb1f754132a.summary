by @entity0 @entity1 has defended a ' wearable @entity3 flag ' it has launched for the @entity4 after claims it resembles a @entity8 outfit			1
the £ 3 @entity9 , with the word ' @entity3 ' emblazoned across it , features a hood which @entity1 said was to allow fans to stay dry in the unpredictable @entity14 weather			1
but some fans took to @entity16 today to point out the similarities between the hoods and those worn by the racist @entity21 organisation , also known by its initials ' @entity8 '			2
@entity1 customers say the new ' @entity24 ' looks like the notorious uniform of the @entity8 the supermarket insists the outfit is merely designed to allow fans to watch @entity3 come @entity29 one website user called @entity32 posted a picture of himself at his @ @entity35 account , writing : ' @entity1 are selling wearable @entity3 flags , they look dodgy to say the least ... ' another user called @entity38 replied on his account : '' @entity39 rules @entity40 ' honestly , do @entity1 simply not bother to see how these things look when worn ? * sigh * ' the flag ’s description on the @entity1 website simply says : ' @entity3 in the @entity4 with this unique wearing flag ! ' a company spokesman said it had also produced a wearable @entity51 flag ahead of the competition , with starts in the @entity55 country on june 12			1
shoppers took to the @entity16 today to point out the sinister similarity of the @entity4 outfit the spokesman said : ' we know there ’s chatter on @entity16 about our wearable @entity4 flags , but it ’s simply a flag with a hood - nothing more , nothing less			1
' we opted for a hood on our wearable @entity3 and @entity51 flags as you never know what the @entity14 weather will bring			2
' we want customers to get behind the team without getting wet			0
' in september last year , the supermarket giant was forced to make a £ 25,000 donation to the mental health charity mind after apologising for advertising an ' mental patient fancy dress costume '			1
the costume - comprising a ragged , blood - spattered straitjacket and pictured being worn by a model covered in blood and brandishing a machete - was on sale for £ 20 through the supermarket 's clothing arm @entity83			2
@entity1 has dismissed the mocking tweets and insist the hood was merely added to keep fans dry the @entity8 was a racist organisation set up in @entity87 , southern @entity21 in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality			1
believing in white supremacy , the group 's members terrorised leaders , both back and white , who called for greater integration			0
confederate general @entity95 was the first leader , or ' grand wizard ' , and presided over a hierarchy of ' grand dragons ' , ' grand titans ' and ' grand cyclopses '			0
members of the @entity8 at a cross burning in the 1960s , the organisation has since all but died out @entity105 's wore white costumes with masks and conical hats designed to scare opponents and hide their identities			0
after dying out in the 1870s , the group was reformed around 1915 and took up the sign of the burning cross at rallies			0
partly fuelled by fears over immigration from the @entity119 and @entity121 revolution in @entity122 , the group swelled to its largest ever size of around 4million members in the 1920s			0
despite a slight resurgance during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s , the group has slowly died away and is now thought to have fewer than 5,000 members .			0

supermarket *releases* @entity3 flag outfit ahead of @entity4 in @entity51
