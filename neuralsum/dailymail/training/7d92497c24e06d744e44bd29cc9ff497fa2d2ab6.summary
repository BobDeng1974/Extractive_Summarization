by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:20 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 11:06 est , 23 july 2013 attack : @entity4 mep @entity3 criticised the ' anti-eu @entity5 ' in conservative ranks who refuse to allow anyone to believe @entity10 should stay in the @entity11 eurosceptic conservatives behave like the ' @entity5 ' towards other members of their party who do not want to sever ties with @entity16 , a @entity4 @entity3 claimed today			1
@entity3 made the explosive claim about his @entity4 colleagues who he claimed will not allow anyone to hold a view ' unless it 's the same view as them '			2
his intervention came as @entity24 warned public support for the @entity11 as it stands today is ‘ wafer - thin ’			1
the prime minister claimed the economy would face more uncertainty if the country ‘ put your head in the sand ’ and pretended there was not a problem with @entity36			2
he insisted @entity10 was better off staying in a reformed @entity11 , than leaving altogether			1
however , party unity over @entity36 was blown apart by the outspoken attack by mr @entity3 on hardline conservatives who want @entity10 to quit the @entity11			1
writing on @entity41 during a debate on @entity36 , he said : ' it seems the anti-eu taliban find it difficult to accept a different point of view ! ' he added : ' the @entity46 do n't want an informed @entity10 public or an informed debate			2
bring it on ! ' mr @entity3 later insisted he had not used the term lightly , adding : ' that 's exactly what they are			2
' ' you are no longer allowed to hold a view unless it 's the same view as them , ' he told @entity57			0
mr @entity24 has promised to renegotiate a ‘ fresh settlement ’ with the @entity11 after the next election before staging an in - out vote before the end of 2017			1
but his policy suffered a major blow yesterday after an official government review found the @entity10 ’s relationship with @entity16 was ‘ broadly appropriate ’			2
the prime minister ’s historic claim to have helped secure a cut in the @entity11 ’s long - term budget was also criticised today by peers who said it is ‘ not as good as it looks ’ because too many other concessions have been made			2
uncertainty : @entity24 insisted business was still investing in the @entity10 ahead of his promised @entity11 referendum , as he visited the @entity77 factory in @entity78 where he met @entity77 chairman and chief executive dr @entity81 ( left ) , apprentice engineer @entity82 , and chairman of the board of the @entity85 dr @entity84 a @entity4 - drafted @entity86 promising a referendum is being piloted through @entity88 by mp @entity89 , but stands little chance of becoming law because both @entity92 and the @entity93 oppose it			1
today mr @entity24 was challenged over whether the uncertainty of an in - out vote by 2017 would deter big businesses from investing in @entity10			1
levels of immigration to @entity10 creates a ' constant drain ' on public services , @entity24 suggested			1
the prime minister was asked during the q&a session at the @entity77 factory why the @entity10 opens its doors to foreigners who are a ' constant drain ' while others ' work hard '			1
mr @entity24 replied : ' i basically agree with you			1
there are some benefits from being a country that welcomes people who want to come here and work hard			0
' but in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that 's completely lax			0
' the pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great			0
' he added that he wanted to see net migration ' coming down faster '			0
' on housing , health , education and legal aid we are showing we are not a soft touch , ' he said			0
speaking at a @entity130 session at a @entity77 car plant in @entity78 , the prime minister replied : ‘ i think a greater uncertainty would be to put your head in the sand and pretend there is n't a problem with @entity36			1
‘ there is a problem and i 'm going to fix it , ’ he added			0
mr @entity24 went on : ' @entity36 is changing and @entity36 needs to change			1
it ’s 28 countries , 18 of which have the same currency – the euro – the other ten of which , like us , do n’t			0
' so , i ’m saying to them , " you need to sort your stuff out , and we ’ll allow you to do that because you need to			0
" ' but at the same time , those countries like @entity10 where , frankly , consent for the @entity11 is wafer thin – we need changes , too			1
so , we ’ll give you your changes if you give us our changes			0
i believe i can negotiate that			0
' however a new government study that says membership of the @entity11 is beneficial for @entity10 was last night branded a ‘ @entity162 whitewash ’			1
despite uncovering a catalogue of problems , the @entity164 review found that the balance of power between @entity16 and @entity168 was ‘ broadly appropriate ’			0
the report sparked anger among @entity4 backbenchers , who questioned why it was commissioned in the first place since the conclusions appear to contradict mr @entity24 ’s policy of renegotiating @entity10 ’s relationship with @entity16			1
doubts were also raised about the deal to cut the @entity11 ’s budget , secured by mr @entity24 against expectations that @entity10 could pull off a spending reduction			1
changes agreed earlier this month in the way the cash can be distributed between years , including rolling over unspent funds , are storing up problems for the future , peers told treasury minister @entity189			0
at the @entity193 sub-committee on @entity11 finances , independent peer @entity190 claimed increased contributions to this year 's single - year budget could hit the longer term agreement , known in @entity16 jargon as the multi-annual financial framework ( @entity200 )			2
patriotic : the prime minister was sporting union flag cufflinks as he left @entity204 to travel to @entity78 this morning lord @entity190 said : ‘ my feeling is you have built up a problem for the future here because in order to get the parliament to agree to the @entity200 numbers you have given them , in the budget for this year , an extra £ 7.5 billion and if expenditure in each of the years of the @entity200 was at the level set from this year the @entity200 ceilings would be broken			0
' but mr @entity189 insisted the @entity10 had opposed the amending budgets to the single - year budget but was outvoted			2
he said : ‘ we opposed the amending budgets			0
they reflected an argument that was made that there were bills unpaid that we felt should have been paid through redeployments but we were outvoted			0
’ the £ 822 billion @entity200 was backed by the @entity88 earlier this month after intense negotiations			0
it followed a fractious round of talks to get an agreement by governments in february , with @entity10 and @entity230 among states pushing for a real - terms cut in the face of opposition from countries that are net beneficiaries .			2

@entity3 takes *swipe* at @entity239 who want to leave the @entity11
@entity242 argues new relationship with @entity11 is needed to maintain @entity10 backing
has promised to renegotiate settlement before holding in - out referendum
challenged at @entity77 car plant over impact of uncertainty on jobs
mr @entity24 also admits immigration is a ' constant drain ' on services
