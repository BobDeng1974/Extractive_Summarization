by @entity0 over the past year , a dizzying array of @entity2 creams have stormed beauty shelves across the country			2
just when we thought we had finally figured out the alphabet formulas , @entity9 has launched a ' dd ' , or ' @entity14 ' , skin shot that claims to work from the inside out			1
we road tested the new shot , which was created with celebrity dermatologist dr @entity18 and contains green tea and guarana			0
taking a shot : the @entity12 mini-drinks by @entity9 like @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 + @entity26 all contain ingredients that are meant to give a big nutritional boost in a single sip in portion size and possible health benefits , @entity9 founder @entity30 claims that the shots are like ' next generation wheatgrass ' - but without the distinctive taste			1
priced at $ 3.95 each , the mini-drinks are becoming a growing trend among @entity37 who want a boost before a post-work gym session or afternoon meeting			1
the ingredients in the latest @entity12 shot claim to have benefits ranging from easing eczema symptoms to aiding weight loss			1
when downed the ice - cold mini-drink ( it 's meant to be kept refrigerated ) in one gulp , my first impression was that it tasted a lot like flavored iced tea - perfect for a summer day pick - me - up			0
it was refreshing and much lighter than the plant - based fresh booster shots i buy at the juice bar			2
glowing skin : @entity59 credits her organic diet with helping her achieve an amazing complexion and while my complexion did not immediately glow like @entity59 's , i did notice that i powered straight through the afternoon without experiencing my usual 4 pm slump			0
this made sense once i did a quick search of the ingredients , and discovered that guarana is also a stimulant whose seeds contain around twice as much caffeine as coffee plants			0
@entity9 has launched six shots previously , all with different ingredients			1
among them are @entity77 , made from a hand - harvested @entity79 berry thought to have beauty - boosting properties , @entity24 , and @entity25 + @entity26 , which @entity9 calls ' nature 's multivitamin			1
' a spokesperson for the @entity84 , where dr. @entity18 is based , explained that the nutritional supplements are n't meant to have an immediate effect , but to be used as part of a healthy diet			0
in addition to his more aggressive beauty treatments like lasers and @entity93 , dr. @entity18 advises his patients to drink a cup of green tea and take a fish oil capsule every day			2
the idea is that over time - unlike a tequila shot - @entity99 can help improve the appearance of skin .			0
