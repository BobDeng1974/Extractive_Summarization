vice president @entity0 wants everyone to know that he has high hopes for the ' nation ' of @entity4			1
@entity0 is n't just a walking gaffe machine – he 's a walking gaffe top - ten list			1
so when he goofed at tuesday 's @entity10 - @entity9 , and there was no f - bomb involved , it did n't make headlines			1
but gaffe he did , in front of 50 world leaders and their entourages at the event held on the sidelines of president @entity21 's @entity10 - @entity20			1
' if @entity4 's governance and institutions can put its people in a position commensurate with their possibilities , the sky is the limit , ' the veep said tuesday			1
' i mean , it is limitless ' ​ ' there 's no reason the nation of @entity4 can not and should not join the ranks of the world 's most prosperous nations in the near term , in the decades ahead			1
there is simply no reason			0
' the skinny - dipping , party guest - groping bumbler who 's one heartbeat away from the presidency once chaired the @entity54			0
not impressed : former @entity56 mayor @entity55 sits with ( from right to left ) @entity59 president @entity58 , @entity61 president @entity60 , and other @entity63 leaders during the @entity10 - @entity9 in @entity64 @entity0 met with @entity66 's president @entity65 at the @entity67 on tuesday @entity0 has been an active participant in this week 's summit			1

@entity0 , a @entity76 source said tuesday , is not expected to speak at the glitzy event			1
that may be just as well			0
everybody loves @entity0 : the veep got a laugh out of @entity76 budget director @entity121 during his ceremonial swearing - in ceremony on tuesday it was just four years ago that he noted in a diplomatic face - palm moment how @entity127 prime minister @entity126 's mother had ' lived in @entity128 for ten years or so ' before her death			1
' @entity130 rest her soul , ' @entity0 said somberly , before realizing that ' wait – your mom ’s still ... your mom ’s still alive			2
' in 2012 he made the sign of the cross while on stage to address a group of more than 1,600 conservative rabbis in @entity144			0
reporters guffawed later that year when he tried to capture the spirit of president @entity148 's famous ' speak softly ' philosophy , by noting that ' the president has a big stick			0
' it brought back memories of a 2008 photo - op outside @entity0 's home where he told journalists that he had just returned from ' a successful dump , ' which turned out to be a trip to a nearby landfill			2
two months later during an @entity162 campaign speech , @entity0 criticized then - @entity164 presidential candidate sen. @entity163 for what he called a ' last - minute economic plan ' that did ' nothing to tackle the number - one job facing the middle class			2
' ' it happens to be , as @entity21 says , a three - letter word : jobs			0
' several of @entity0 's most cringe - worthy moments have riled conservatives who say their own political stars would have been pilloried in print and on television if they had made similar comments			2
' you can not go to a 7 - 11 or a @entity181 unless you have a slight @entity183 accent , ' he told an @entity183 - @entity10 man in 2006 , with a @entity186 camera rolling			0
' i 'm not joking			0
