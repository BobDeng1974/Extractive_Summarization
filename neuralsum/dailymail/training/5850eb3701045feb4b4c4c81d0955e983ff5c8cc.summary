by @entity0 the makers of @entity2 and @entity3 baby milk claimed their product provides calcium for ' strong bones ' and iron for ' brain development ' a tv advert for @entity2 baby milk has been banned for exaggerating the product ’s health benefits			1
the commercial said that the powdered formula provides calcium for ‘ strong bones ’ and iron for ‘ brain development ’			1
but pro-breast feeding campaigners said it suggested an added advantage , when nutrients added to the product only play a part in the ‘ normal ’ development of the bones and brain			1
a ruling published by the @entity28 today says manufacturer @entity29 misrepresented the health effects			2
the group @entity32 , which brought the complaint , insists breast milk followed by a mixed diet is better for developing babies and said @entity29 is ‘ ripping parents off ’			2
its campaigns chief , @entity38 , said : ‘ advertisements such as @entity29 ’s suggest that follow - on milks provide health benefits , but they are unnecessary products and @entity29 is simply ripping parents off , using false claims to make them think they need these milks			0
‘ yes , calcium is needed for normal growth and bone development in children and iron contributes to normal cognitive development , but these are provided by a normal diet and @entity29 ’s products offer nothing special other than a way for the company to fill its pockets			1
‘ the cost of these multi-million pound advertising campaigns goes onto the price of the milks making them even more expensive			0
’ he complained that the @entity28 system for policing commercials does not work in the consumer interest			0
the commercial has already appeared many times and there is no sanction against @entity29 , other than the publicity generated by the @entity28 decision			0
mr @entity38 said : ‘ we have won repeated cases proving that claims made for baby formula do not stand up to scrutiny , but the firms continue using them regardless because the @entity28 is a toothless body requiring no corrections and levying no fines			2
‘ many of these practices also break the law in our view , but trading standards and the @entity86 are failing to hold companies to account			0
companies should be prosecuted and fined for repeated violations			0
@entity100 has approved the phrase - ‘ calcium is needed for normal growth and development of bone in children ’			1
@entity29 said its phrase - ‘ provides calcium for strong bones ’ - means the same thing			1
similarly , @entity100 has approved the sentence - ‘ @entity112 contributes to normal cognitive development of children ’			2
@entity29 argued its phrase - ‘ iron for brain development ’ - includes better , more consumer friendly , language			1
however , the @entity28 rejected the firm ’s explanation and said the wording in the commercial implied a greater health effect than is allowed			0
consequently , it said it should not be shown again in its current format .			0
