volunteers scanning thousands of images from @entity4 's @entity3 space telescope have made a major breakthrough in our understanding of how planets form			1
they reported spotting strange ' yellow balls ' in images			1
after further analysis , researchers now believe they are the early stages of massive stars forming			1
volunteers using the web - based @entity17 brought star - forming features nicknamed " yellowballs " to the attention of researchers , who later showed that they are a phase of massive star formation			1
the infrared wavelengths detected by @entity3 have been assigned visible colors we can see with our eyes			0
in addition to the yellow balls , there are many green bubbles with red centers , populating a landscape of swirling gas and dust			1
these bubbles are the result of massive newborn stars blowing out cavities in their surroundings			0
a thorough analysis by the team led to the conclusion that the yellow balls precede the green bubble features , representing a phase of star formation that takes place before the bubbles form			1
volunteers scan tens of thousands of starry images from @entity4 's @entity51 using the @entity52 - based @entity17 , and began talking about the strange features			1
' the volunteers started chatting about the yellow balls they kept seeing in the images of our galaxy , and this brought the features to our attention , ' said @entity63 of the @entity64 in @entity65			1
a colorful , 122 - foot ( 37 - meter ) @entity3 mosaic of the @entity67 hangs at the planetarium , showcasing our galaxy 's bubbling brew of stars			2
the yellow balls in this mosaic appear small but are actually several hundred to thousands of times the size of our solar system			1
' with prompting by the volunteers , we analyzed the yellow balls and figured out that they are a new way to detect the early stages of massive star formation , ' said @entity83 of @entity84 , @entity85			1
' the simple question of ' hmm , what 's that ? ' led us to this discovery			0
' @entity83 is lead author , and @entity90 a co-author , of a new study on the findings in the @entity94			0
the @entity17 is one of many so - called citizen scientist projects making up the @entity97 website , which relies on crowdsourcing to help process scientific data			2
so far , more than 70 scientific papers have resulted from volunteers using @entity97 , four of which are tied to the @entity17			2
in 2009 , volunteers using a @entity97 project called @entity104 began chatting about unusual objects they dubbed ' green peas			2
' their efforts led to the discovery of a class of compact galaxies that churned out extreme numbers of stars			0
in the @entity17 , volunteers scan through images that @entity3 took of the thick plane of our galaxy , where newborn stars are igniting in swaths of dust			1
the infrared wavelengths detected by @entity3 have been assigned visible colors we can see with our eyes			0
in addition to the yellow balls , there are many green bubbles with red centers , populating a landscape of swirling gas and dust			1
these bubbles are the result of massive newborn stars blowing out cavities in their surroundings			0
the green bubble rims are made largely of organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( @entity140 ) , cleared away by blasts of radiation and winds from the central star			0
dust warmed by the star appears red in the center of the bubbles			0
this series of images show three evolutionary phases of massive star formation , as pictured in infrared images from @entity4 's @entity51			0
volunteers have classified more than 5,000 of these green bubbles using the project 's web - based tools			1
when they started reporting that they were finding more reoccurring features in the shape of yellow balls , the @entity3 researchers took note and even named the features accordingly			1
in astronomy and other digital imaging , yellow represents areas where green and red overlap			0
so what are these yellow balls ? a thorough analysis by the team led to the conclusion that the yellow balls precede the green bubble features , representing a phase of star formation that takes place before the bubbles form			2
' the yellow balls are a missing link , ' said @entity90 , ' between the very young embryonic stars buried in dark filaments and newborn stars blowing the bubbles			1
' ' if you wind the clock backwards from the bubbles , you get the yellow ball features , ' said @entity83			0
so far , the volunteers have identified more than 900 of these compact yellow features			2
the next step for the researchers is to look at their distribution			0
many appear to be lining the rims of the bubbles , a clue that perhaps the massive stars are triggering the birth of new stars as they blow the bubbles , a phenomenon known as triggered star formation			0
if the effect is real , the researchers should find that the yellow balls statistically appear more often with bubble walls			2
' these results attest to the importance of citizen scientist programs , ' said @entity211			0
@entity83 added , ' there is always the potential for serendipitous discovery that makes citizen science both exciting for the participants and useful to the professional astronomer			0
