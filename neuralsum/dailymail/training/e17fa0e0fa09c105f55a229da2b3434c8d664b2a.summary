@entity0 branded @entity1 ‘ stupid ’ for his sending - off in the @entity3 derby defeat that consigned @entity4 to their worst start to a season in 28 years			1
@entity7 scored @entity9 ’s 63rd - minute strike in the 1 - 0 win but the turning point came six minutes before half - time when @entity1 lunged at @entity13 to earn a second yellow card from referee @entity15 , having been cautioned earlier for needlessly blocking a clearance by goalkeeper @entity17			1
‘ in a derby you have to be careful — the second yellow card is a stupid yellow card , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ the first i did n’t see but as a player with a yellow card you have to deal with that			1
you have to control your aggression			2
i said that to the players			2
he said ( sorry ) and is very humble			0
you can only accept it			0
nevertheless it is , in my opinion , not so smart			2
’ it is the second sunday on the run that @entity18 has accused one of his players of stupidity			0
he said the same about @entity49 last week after he was booked for removing his shirt while celebrating his late equaliser against @entity52			0
@entity18 did , however , defend @entity4 midfielder @entity53 from accusations that he he spat at @entity7			1
video footage online showed the @entity57 standing over @entity7 as the @entity59 lay on the ground			1
@entity61 , who was later booked , brings down @entity49 but was not carded for this challenge @entity0 explains a point to @entity64 as @entity4 looked to hold out against the extra man @entity7 eventually broke the deadlock just after the hour mark , with a typically excellent finish @entity69 ( centre ) had to come on for @entity4 but @entity18 insisted it was n't a problem @entity4 ’s manager said : ‘ i have heard it is a question on social media but already he has said he is shouting and sometimes when you shout there is a little bit of saliva			1
i do n’t think he is a spitting figure			0
’ @entity9 ’s victory moved them six points behind leaders @entity52 , while @entity4 now have only 13 points from 10 games — their lowest total at this stage since @entity88 was sacked this same week in 1986			1
@entity9 ’s fourth successive derby triumph means @entity4 are yet to win away under @entity18 and are only five points above the drop zone			2
@entity4 ’s defensive problems increased when @entity93 was carried off with a dislocated shoulder , leaving @entity18 short of options for saturday ’s home match against @entity97			0
@entity7 celebrates his strike , which turned out to be the winner , but not before @entity9 had survived a few scares @entity101 makes a point to his players as @entity9 held on to win in the @entity104 @entity1 , the third @entity4 player to be sent off this season , will be suspended while @entity106 and @entity107 are still injured			1
@entity4 did rally late and forced @entity17 into two fine saves			2
but @entity9 had three penalty claims refused by referee @entity15 during a heated match which also saw @entity17 seemingly touch heads with the official while appealing against a decision			1
city boss @entity101 would not criticise @entity15 about the penalty decisions but said @entity93 should have been sent off for bringing down @entity116			0
‘ we played very well , ’ said the @entity117			0
‘ we scored and in that moment we dropped back a bit more			0
we lost the high possession of the ball we had before			0
it is not the way we must finish games			0
’ @entity125 should have had penalty - @entity101			2

@entity0 says @entity1 *'s* red card was ' not very smart '
@entity1 was shown two yellow cards before half - time
one was for blocking a @entity17 kick and one for a foul on @entity13
@entity9 won 1 - 0 through a @entity7 goal
