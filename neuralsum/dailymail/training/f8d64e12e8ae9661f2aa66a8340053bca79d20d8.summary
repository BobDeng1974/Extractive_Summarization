by @entity0 a @entity2 inventor has created the world 's first intelligent phone charger that knows when to switch itself off			1
the @entity6 charger aims to save the environment , and prevent fire hazards , by switching itself off immediately once a smartphone is no longer being charged			0
created by @entity13 engineer @entity12 , it was developed after his fiancee @entity15 's childhood home burnt to the ground by a mobile phone charger left plugged in			1
the @entity6 charger ( pictured ) aims to save the environment and prevent fire hazards by switching itself off immediately once a smartphone is detached the charger shuts down automatically and isolates itself from the electricity grid once the phone is unplugged			1
input voltage : 110 - 250v output voltage : @entity30 stand - by power : @entity32 compatibility : @entity35 and @entity36 ( not @entity34 yet ) connector : @entity38 , @entity39 30 - pin and micro-usb weight : 0.2lbs ( 100g ) warranty : 12 months @entity12 , 33 , from @entity43 , @entity2 , said : ‘ mobile phone chargers consume power , even if there is no phone connected to it			1
‘ i set myself a challenge to invent a charger that is much safer and consumes no standby power			1
two years later , i came up with a solution			0
‘ how it works is the power to the charger is limited and isolated from the grid - it 's a pulse of power that comes off the grid rather than a stream			1
the phone charger simply turns of the flow			2
' the charger comes with several different connectors , including the @entity39 30 - pin connector , the new @entity62 connector , and micro-usb			2
users can also choose to buy either a @entity35 or @entity36 two - prong plug by pledging at least £ 17 ( $ 29 ) on @entity66			1
the company is planning to launch a @entity34 version of the device later this year			2
@entity70 is trying to raise £ 41,000 ( $ 70,000 ) on @entity66 with the aim of delivering pre-orders to @entity66 supporters in october			1
the ‘ @entity75 ’ technology is currently patent pending and full - scale commercial production of the charger will begin in december			2
the eco plug is only turned on when it is plugged into a phone			0
when it is taken out the plug turns off , preventing overheating and possible fires			1
the @entity86 plug can be used with a variety of devices including most @entity90 phones and the latest iphones ‘ it 's one thing to aim to be safer and conserve energy , but it 's another for the device to do it for you , ' continued @entity12			1
‘ it is really taking off now , i am now in talks with mobile phone manufacturers			0
‘ there have been so many tragic stories about phone chargers when they have been left on , i thought it was strange that nobody had done this			0
‘ @entity15 is definitely my driving force behind the project , her story helped me come up with the idea , and she is very passionate			0
‘ our mission is to make the world a better place - with @entity6 charger one that can save money and the environment while improving fire safety			2
’ he added : ‘ in one year , for every mobile charger you own , you pay for 8,000 watts of wasted energy , [ equivalent to ] keeping your laptop running for 260 hours or leaving your lights on for a month			1
‘ there are almost seven billion mobile phones in the world			0
by leaving mobile phone chargers on , we use the equivalent of two nuclear power plants or 25,000 wind power mills			1
’ energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			2
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			0
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0

@entity2 engineer has invented a ' smart plug ' that turns off when not in use
@entity86 charger shuts down automatically when a device is not connected
power is limited and device uses a pulse , rather than a stream of energy
mobile chargers are said to waste an average of 8,000 watts each year - the equivalent of leaving household lights on for a month
users can choose a @entity35 or @entity36 plug by pledging £ 17 ( $ 29 ) on @entity66
firm is *hoping* to raise £ 41,000 ( $ 70,000 ) and deliver devices by october
