@entity1 : they ’ve done it again			1
that ’s five @entity4 now , their aura disseminated on five different continents – @entity7 ( 1987 ) , @entity8 ( 1999 ) , @entity9 ( 2003 ) , @entity10 ( 2007 ) , and @entity11 ( 2015 )			2
if they ever stage the tournament in @entity16 , the rest of the world may as well save themselves the air fare			0
their story is a remarkable one – of swift , ruthless renewal and of the belief inherent in @entity23 cricket that their natural position is up there , not down here			0
to watch them against @entity27 was to watch expectation thrash hope			1
@entity1 ’s self - belief can not simply be transplanted into other cricketing cultures			1
but their refusal to tolerate failing systems can			0
@entity35 was the impressive leader of @entity1 's equally impressive @entity37 triumph no team could stop the @entity23 claiming yet another @entity37 , this time on home soil less than two years ago everyone was having a good chuckle at @entity42 and @entity43			1
@entity1 lost 4 - 0 in @entity44 , @entity43 swung for @entity45 , and @entity46 was put out to pasture a fortnight before the @entity48			1
while @entity50 creaked their way through a flattering 3 - 0 win that summer , convincing themselves that all was well with the world , @entity1 ’s new coach @entity49 was thanking @entity53 for a schedule that would give his side a crack at instant revenge			1
@entity1 ’s nadirs are as low as anyone ’s – they just last less long			1
it is inconceivable that they would tolerate , as @entity50 are in the process of doing , a period of failure that extends far beyond the dictionary definition of ‘ transition ’			1
for that , as much as anything , their latest @entity37 win deserves an admiring nod			1
@entity1 generally know when and how to peak			1
but their behaviour during sunday ’s final means this admiration stretches only so far			2
not for the first time , we were reminded of a curious contradiction at the heart of @entity23 cricket : while they have always been engagingly good losers ( better , in fact , than most ) , they are also deeply unlovable winners			0
@entity86 , who claimed he felt uncomfortable about @entity27 ’s niceness during the build - up to the group game at @entity90 , was at the centre of things , as he often is			1
after @entity93 was bowled by @entity94 , @entity86 felt the need to clap his gloves in @entity93 ’s face			1
then , after the dismissal of @entity99 , @entity86 and @entity100 sent him packing with various snarls and grimaces			1
@entity86 clapped in @entity93 's face after the @entity27 batsman was bowled during the final @entity99 ( left ) was also given a less - than - sporting send - off by @entity86 and @entity100 ( second right ) a meme doing the rounds used both this image and one of @entity110 shaking @entity35 ’s hand at the end of his match - clinching 74 to compare and contrast the teams ’ attitudes			1
even while they ’re basking in glory , it should make @entity119 squirm			0
mind you , it was n’t much of a surprise			0
the immediate postscript of @entity27 ’s win over @entity9 in the semi-final was the sight of @entity99 comforting the stricken @entity127 , like @entity128 and @entity129 all over again			1
@entity1 , on the other hand , gurned their way through victory over @entity44 in @entity134 , with @entity135 harrying @entity136 , and @entity43 applauding from the balcony after his fellow wallflower @entity139 dropped @entity86			1
for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity143 : @ the_topspin the @entity144 ignored all this – presumably because they did n’t want to be seen to sully the tournament ’s blue - riband matches			0
but they had already punished @entity149 ’s @entity148 for his crude goading of @entity151 in the quarter - finals – a set - to which at least had the merit of forming part of a stirring head - to - head			0
but sledging without context is even worse : the @entity93 and @entity99 send - offs just looked crass and cruel			2
sledging , we are told with wearying certainty , is part of the game			2
but when did it become de rigueur to cackle at a batsman who is already dealing with the disappointment of heading back to the pavilion ? @entity166 used to do it all the time , not least to @entity168			0
his rationale was that he was getting inside @entity168 ’s head before the next battle			0
in a six - test series , it made a sick kind of sense			0
@entity86 has no such excuse			2
@entity43 , ( left ) spraying beer at the @entity178 after sunday 's victory , is well known for his brash attitude the @entity23 ' behaviour harks back to the example set by the likes of @entity166 ( second right ) no @entity23 cricket - lover i know enjoys this sort of thing , though some on @entity143 claim with some justification that the @entity191 are in no position to talk : see the life and crimes of @entity195			1
but @entity50 fans are also aware that @entity195 ’s sledging contributed to their team ’s unpopularity during the years when @entity201 ’s side was doing well			1
when @entity50 ’s wheel turned , there was precious little sympathy waiting for them on the other side			2
the same applies to @entity1			2
if there were neutrals out there who did n’t want @entity27 to win the final , they did n’t immediately advertise the fact			1
and this had more to do with the fact that sports fans love an underdog			0
they also dislike arrogance , nastiness and sneering			0
you can admire the @entity23 cricket team			2
but it ’s a little harder to warm to them			0
a change of plan from now on the @entity228 will move from its weekly slot on a tuesday and appear more regularly , as a blog rather than a column			0
it will come out whenever there is a big cricket story to comment on , and sometimes even when there is n’t			0
if you are n’t already a subscriber , please click here to make sure it is emailed to you , free of charge			0
@entity242 thanks boss ! regular readers will know of the @entity144 ’s @entity246 president @entity245 , who recently endeared himself to his own organisation by referring to them – not unreasonably – as the ‘ @entity249 ’			0
that followed @entity252 ’s quarter - final loss to @entity44 , when @entity245 was convinced the umpires had it in for his team			2
now , he appears to be at it again , this time after he was denied the chance to hand over the @entity37 to the @entity23 team on the podium at the @entity178 on sunday			1
instead the honour befell @entity144 chairman @entity261 , prompting @entity245 to huff about his ‘ constitutional right ’ , duly ‘ dishonoured ’			0
@entity263 ( left ) is threatening to reveal @entity144 ' mischief ' , despite being its president ominously , @entity245 is reported to have said : ‘ after i go back home , i will let the whole world know what ’s happening in @entity144			0
i will let the whole world know about those guys who are doing these mischievous things			0
’ as president of the organisation he is threatening to rat on , @entity245 may like to ask himself why he has n’t considered spilling the beans before			0
you could not , as they say , make it up			0
revolving doors @entity281 ’s decision to pull out of his @entity283 deal with @entity284 could have a curious knock - on effect for @entity50			2
it means an extra slot in the @entity284 team for both a middle - order batsman and an overseas player – and that could be good news for @entity293			2
but it also lessens the chance of @entity293 being released for a few days to captain @entity50 in their one - day international against @entity298 at @entity299 on may 8			2
look out for the very short - term appointment of yet another @entity50 captain … @entity281 ( left ) celebrated @entity1 's @entity37 win with pal @entity100 best bib and tucker it ’s easy to forget there were two @entity23 captains at the @entity37 : @entity35 … and @entity306 , who played one game , scored 55 against @entity50 , and ceded both the armband and his place in the side when @entity35 returned from injury			1
he evidently made peace with his role			0
spies in @entity1 tell us that , 18 hours after the @entity37 final , a bleary - eyed @entity306 appeared at a civic reception still wearing the fluorescent bib that appeared affixed to him for most of the tournament			1
@entity306 ( right ) chuckles at @entity50 's misery during @entity1 's @entity323 a win			1

@entity1 lifted the @entity37 after beating @entity27 in the final
@entity35 's team have capped a *marvellous* *collective* comeback
@entity50 have plenty to learn from the likes of @entity333
but @entity1 's conduct in victory is not to be celebrated
@entity86 and @entity43 are chief *culprits* in sledging *opponents*
