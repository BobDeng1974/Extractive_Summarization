efficient : @entity1 developed the all - in - one meal drink after becoming fed up with the amount of time and money he spent cooking a man who tired of wasting time and energy cooking and eating claims to have come up with a novel solution - a cocktail that contains all the nutrients he needs to survive			1
@entity1 â€“ a 24 - year - old software engineer from @entity16 - says he became fed up with the inordinate amount of time and money he spent cooking			1
determined to spend his time - and money - more effectively , he developed an ' all - in - one ' drink to give him his complete fill of vitamins and minerals , according to the website vice.com			1
he claims the beige concoction - which bears a striking resemblance to pancake batter - ' tastes great ' and he has yet to tire of it after six weeks			1
called @entity31 , he believes it contains all the vital elements of a balanced diet , but with just a third of the calories			1
mr @entity1 says his inspiration for the cocktail came from seeing an elderly family friend fall ill. he told @entity39 : ' i was home for @entity42 and saw an elderly family friend get admitted to the hospital after losing an unhealthy amount of weight			1
he was losing strength in one of his arms and found it very difficult to cook			2
' ' i started wondering why something as simple and important as food was still so inefficient , given how streamlined and optimised other modern things are			0
' i also had an incentive to live as cheaply as possible , and i yearned for the productivity benefit of being healthy			0
i 'd been reading a lot of books on biology and i started to think that it 's probably all the same to our cells whether it gets nutrients from a powder or a carrot			1
' he maintains that @entity31 contains everything the body needs in terms of vitamins , minerals and nutrients such as essential amino acids , carbohydrates and fat			1
his stance is that it 's the minerals fruit and vegetables contain that are important , rather than the actual produce			0
he explained : ' we need carbs , not bread			0
amino acids , not milk			0
it 's still fine to eat these whenever you want , but not everyone can afford them or has the desire to eat them			0
' complete package : he maintains that his meal replacement , @entity31 , contains everything the body needs in terms of vitamins , minerals and nutrients such as essential amino acids , carbohydrates and fat when it comes to fat , he uses olive oil and fish oil , but it 's more complex in terms of carbohydrates			1
he uses an oligosaccharide , which he claims takes the body longer to metabolise than fructose or table sugar , therefore giving a steady flow of energy for a longer period of time			1
other ' non-essential ' additions are antioxidants and probiotics			0
while it sounds like a food - lover 's worst nightmare , mr @entity1 maintains not having to worry about food a welcome relief			1
he said : ' no groceries , dishes , deciding what to eat , no endless conversations weighing the relative merits of gluten - free , keto , paleo or vegan			2
' power and water bills are lower			0
i save hours a day and hundreds of dollars a month			1
i feel liberated from a crushing amount of repetitive drudgery			0
' it 's a very " complete " sensation , more sweet than anything			0
eating to me is a leisure activity , like going to the movies , but i do n't want to go to the movies three times a day			2
' if i had any money or a girlfriend i would probably eat out more often , ' he concedes			2
he claims the beige concoction - which bears a striking resemblance to pancake batter - ' tastes great ' and he has yet to tire of it after six weeks he estimates he was spending $ 220 on groceries , and another $ 250 eating out for lunch and the occasional dinner			1
now , consuming only @entity31 costs him around $ 50 month			2
he adds that because he has such control over his diet , he finds it easy to lose weight by changing the proportions of nutrients in his drink			1
of his sceptics , he says he understands it , adding that many nutrition experts and academics have expressed an interest in his work			0
but he added : ' bad scepticism is stuff like , " this is stupid			0
you ca n't live on powders and chemicals , you need healthy , fresh food ! " ' going forward , he hopes his findings could help with world hunger			0
but @entity172 , a nutritionist and author of several books , including ' the obesity epidemic : what caused it ? how can we stop it ? ' is sceptical about mr @entity1 's approach			1
she told @entity182 : ' food is not only vital , but enjoyable			2
it really does n't take that long to fry egg and bacon or warm porridge for breakfast or sizzle a steak for dinner			0

@entity237 ( from the words @entity235 and @entity236 ) was apparently introduced as an essential nutritional supplement for soldiers during the @entity240			0
' there is also no guarantee that his micro nutrients ( vitamins and minerals ) are in the form that the body needs			2
' as for the product itself , contrary to what @entity1 says , we do not need carbohydrate - and certainly not 200g of the stuff			1
soylent is 50 per cent carb , 13 per cent protein and 37 per cent fat - better than the 55/15/30 guidelines from our governments , but still not as good as just eating real food ( meat , eggs and dairy , fish , nuts , fruit and vegetables ) and letting the macro nutrients ( carbs , fat and protein ) being what they will be ( naturally high in protein and fat and low in carbohydrate )			1
' she added that the measures detailed for a daily intake are also way too low in calories			2
' his product details 200g of carb , 50g protein and 65g fat daily			0
that approximates to 1,585 calories			2
the @entity289 recommendations are for 2,079 and 2,605 for women and men respectively			0

@entity1 , 24 , became tired of spending time and money cooking
