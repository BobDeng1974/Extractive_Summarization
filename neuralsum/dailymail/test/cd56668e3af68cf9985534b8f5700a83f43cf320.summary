@entity1 international @entity0 has delivered an encouraging fitness bulletin as he continues to recover from a season - ending injury and retain the hope of keeping alive his @entity6 dream			1
the @entity8 no 8 has not played since breaking his left leg during an @entity11 game against @entity12 in early january			1
but the signs suggest he is on course to play a part during @entity1 's @entity6 warm - up period ahead of the tournament kicking off in mid-september			1
@entity0 is hopeful of featuring for @entity1 at the forthcoming @entity6 despite his long - term injury @entity0 last featured for @entity1 when he scored two tries during their victory over @entity21 five months ago			1
injury then struck , and he missed the entire @entity24 campaign as a result			2
the 26 - year - old , though , remains an integral part of @entity1 boss @entity29 's @entity6 plans , and the current prognosis is a good one after @entity0 recently underwent final surgery to remove a pin from his leg			1
' to be honest , i have not found this difficult at all , ' said 27 times - capped @entity0 , after watching his @entity8 colleagues continue their preparations for friday night 's @entity39 final against @entity40			1
' i am really positive and using this as a great experience to make myself better for when i come back			1
who else gets six months off to rest up and train hard ? ' yes , i will be at a disadvantage in terms of the fact i have n't played any rugby			1
' but looking at the @entity6 in particular , there will be lads who would n't have played for probably two and a bit months going into the first ( warm - up ) game , so everyone is going to be on an equal playing field			1
' things are going well at the moment			2
i am just trying to make sure i get back healthy when i come back			1
@entity56 8 @entity0 broke his left leg playing against @entity12 in the @entity11 in january ' i have a lot of strengthening to do around my legs - in the early stages you do n't want to rush that			1
when things strengthen up , that 's when i can start chucking some serious tin around			0
' i had an operation last week			0
it is a case of seeing if things affect my ankle , and if they do n't , then i can do them again			0
' it is very reactive			0
i just have to take it day by day			0
it could be a couple of weeks down the line or a couple of months down the line when i run again , but there is no point rushing this sort of thing			0
' @entity29 is due to name a 45 - man @entity6 training squad next month , followed by his final 31 - man group for the tournament in late august			1
@entity1 's @entity6 preparations , meanwhile , also feature home and away games against @entity88 in august , plus a september appointment with reigning @entity24 champions @entity90 at @entity91			1
@entity0 last played for @entity1 during his side 's victory against the @entity21 at @entity91 in november reflecting on the injury , @entity0 added : ' it was tough , but it was one of those things			1
it happens - deal with it			2
' if i start thinking about what i missed out on , i 'm just going to become negative			0
i have this mindset going forward about living the law of attraction			0
' it is basically positivity breeds positivity			0
if you get that positive mindset , you attract everything into your life that is positive			0
i 'm thinking of this as a positive experience			0
' i can get bigger , better , faster , stronger and improve myself as a player before i come back			2
i can use this to my advantage			0
otherwise i could sit there and fester and get fat , lazy and never come back			2
' i sat in the hospital and thought to myself ' okay , it 's done			0
how long is it going to take me to get back ? '' ' ideally , i would like to be back playing in those warm - up games because that gives me a shot of getting in the squad			1
' there are so many variables about what can happen , though			0
' i might get a couple of months down the line and think that realistically i 'm not going to get back , so think about next season instead			2
i have to look after myself			0
' yes , i desperately want to get back and put myself in contention , but i 'm not going to do anything that is detrimental to my health			2
' right at this moment , i am in a great place			0
