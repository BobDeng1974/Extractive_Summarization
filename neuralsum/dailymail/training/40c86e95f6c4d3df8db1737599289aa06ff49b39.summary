he had lured his wife to her death on the pretence that she would drop off their children at the home of his brother to spend the weekend with him			2

@entity9 had lured his wife to her death on the pretence that she would drop off their children at the home of his brother to spend the weekend with him @entity37 footage of @entity133 at @entity134 @entity37 footage of the children leaving @entity134 , where the defendant 's brother lived in this still @entity139 leaves @entity140 with a holdall the jury was told that telephone , @entity145 and message services were deployed to pretend to others that ms @entity11 was still alive			1
@entity85 was arrested on july 4 and made no complaint of any mental illness , the court heard			1
he told police the relationship had been trouble - free until january last year when his wife rang police about a row when he had taken her phone			1
he said he had seen pictures of his wife in underwear			0
detectives were told he had not seen her since april and he had tried to contact her 30 times but believed her to be in @entity159 or @entity24			2
mr @entity162 told the jury : ' quite plainly , ladies and gentlemen , the majority of these facts were lies			0
' the next day , @entity72 told police that ms @entity11 was not alive and she was buried at the side of a layby on the @entity110			1
he denied helping his brother to bury her or murder her and said he had not seen her body			1
' police outside a house on @entity175 in @entity87 , @entity21 in connection with the murder of @entity178 he added : ' the court heard he agreed to show police where her grave was but the location could not be found			1
@entity185 said the search for ms @entity11 's body goes on			1
so far , @entity185 have scoured a number of lay - bys on a 15 - mile stretch of the @entity110 with the assistance of @entity192 and the military			2
following today 's sentencing , detective chief inspector @entity194 , of @entity185 's @entity195 , said : ' @entity197 was a young mother - of - three with everything to live for			2
' she was beginning to put an abusive and violent relationship behind her and had genuine cause to be optimistic for the future			2
' but at the point , when she thought she might be able to create a better life for her and her children - free of the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of @entity9 - her husband snatched it all away in the cruellest and most despicable way possible			1
' invited to a neutral meeting place , he murdered her in cold blood while her children were in the next room			2
we might never know whether they heard or saw anything of their mother 's last movements			0
' to deprive his own children of their mother is both sickening and chilling in the extreme			2
to later attempt to justify the killing by claiming a @entity224 was about to attack him is both insulting to @entity197 's memory and counter to all the evidence of a pre-planned honour - killing			1
' and , make no mistake , this was an honour killing			1
honour - based violence is committed to protect or defend the " honour " of a family and / or community , usually against young women , where they have acted outside perceived acceptable female behaviour patterns			1
' @entity9 's murderous actions were motivated by his outrage and jealousy that @entity197 would attempt to take control of her own life and live a more westernised life , after suffering years of abuse at his hands			0
detective chief inspector @entity194 said : ' she was beginning to put an abusive and violent relationship behind her and had genuine cause to be optimistic for the future ' ' his male " pride " clearly could n't take a strong woman trying to determine her own fate , so he carried out one final act that would ensure she could never defy him again			1
' the irony is that this horrific act of self - pity has brought nothing but shame on him and his family			1
' he has also told a catalogue of lies to wriggle out of his date with justice , which has not only created a considerable amount of additional work for detectives , but also prolonged the agony of @entity197 's family and has prevented us finding her body			2
' we continue to employ the most hi - tech methods to search for her and we will not stop until we find her and she can be given the dignified burial she deserves			0
' @entity21 @entity59 was told @entity9 and @entity24 - born @entity197 had married in december 1987 when she was just 15 and had three children together			1
prosecutor @entity97 said it was a ' love marriage ' rather than an arranged one but only came about as @entity197 ’s sister was married to @entity9 ’s brother			0
@entity9 and @entity24 - born @entity197 had married in december 1987 when she was just 15 they fled @entity277 initially for @entity278 but emigrated to the @entity26 in 2004 and after living in @entity279 for five years moved to @entity21 where @entity280 was already living			0
in that same year @entity197 began confiding in friends her husband was beating her			0
mr @entity162 said a friend witnessed the aftermath of an attack and added : ' she saw @entity9 angry like a monster shouting he would kill her			0
it became clear to her that he and his family were controlling of her			0
' it appears he was violent , sexually and physically and would force her to give him money			0
she told one friend she feared he would kill her			0
' he was prone to anger and openly displayed			0
he was contemptuous of females			0
' she had the courage to free herself from him using a solicitor and began to become a little westernised			0
she went to college and had friends , male and female			0
' this was all too much			0
during this period she was making friends outside her family circle			0
no doubt this was deeply resented by the defendant and in all probability by the rest of his family			0
' @entity197 left the family home in @entity311 , @entity21 with the children to move to a hostel and later in may 2013 rented a property in @entity315 and filed for divorce			0
she had also formed a relationship with a married man she met through an internet site			0
@entity197 was last seen alive on june 7 last year when she met a friend in @entity21 ’s @entity321 and told of a plan to drop off her three children with her estranged husband via @entity325 ’s flat for the weekend			0
that evening at around 8pm she was killed at the apartment after @entity78 ’s partner was told to stay away due to a ' family meeting			0
' later @entity197 ’s body was driven away in @entity280 ’s camper van and at 3am the following morning , the @entity330 vehicle was spotted parked in a layby on the @entity110 by an hgv driver			0
three hours later the camper van broke down and an aa man described the smell inside the vehicle as a ' rancid stench '			0
another man said of @entity9 , @entity341 and a third brother @entity342 , 34 , who was also in the vehicle : ' all three stunk , smelt dirty and looked like they had just run a marathon			0

@entity85 killed @entity11 an hour after she dropped off children
he dressed up in her jeans and headscarf to carry her body out in a suitcase
his brothers are also jailed for helping him try to cover up the murder
her body has n't been found but is believed to be buried in @entity28
she had complained before about his abusive behaviour *–* but he denied it
police called the ' honour killing ' a ' horrific act of self - pity '
