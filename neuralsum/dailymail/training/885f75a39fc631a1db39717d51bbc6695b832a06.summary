by @entity0 education secretary @entity1 has branded the long summer holiday a relic of the 19th century , when children were needed to help on farms the six - week school summer holiday could be scrapped because head teachers think it makes terms too long			1
most are in favour of spreading holidays more evenly throughout the year to ease pressure on staff			2
leaders of the @entity15 said spacing breaks across the year – and adopting different patterns around the country – would also bring down family holiday prices , which soar in the peak summer season			1
a total of 55 per cent of @entity15 members polled are in favour of overhauling term structures			1
the union , which represents 28,000 heads and deputies , will now conduct research into the impact of the long summer break on children ’s learning before adopting the change as a policy			1
the move , discussed at the @entity15 ’s annual conference in @entity37 at the weekend , is the furthest any classroom union has gone towards endorsing a reduction in the six - week summer break			1
it is widely viewed as sacrosanct by teachers , but education secretary @entity1 has branded it a relic of the 19th century , when children were needed to help on farms			1
he will allow all state schools to alter their term dates from next year			2
schools that govern their own admissions , such as academies , can already do so , but only a few have made radical changes			0
one is @entity56 ’s @entity55 , which has five terms of eight weeks separated by two - week holidays , and a four - or five - week summer break			1
@entity60 , the @entity15 general secretary , admitted the proposal for shorter but more frequent holidays would be controversial in the teaching profession			2
however , he said @entity66 research suggested children suffered ‘ learning loss ’ during a long summer break			1
mr @entity60 added : ‘ it seems like at the end of term everybody ’s ready to drop			0
' not reducing the amount of holiday but distributing it more evenly across the year might be one solution to that			0
’ having different times off around the country would also reduce the price premium added by travel companies as demand surges during school holidays			0
mr @entity60 said : ‘ it would be good for the parents of children , it would be good for attendance because it would take away some of the excuses , and it would be good for teachers as well			0
’ however , some @entity15 members oppose the move			1
@entity93 , head of @entity94 in @entity95 , said that , in effect , most teachers had only four weeks off over summer as they spent two weeks preparing for the new term			2
schools that govern their own admissions , such as academies , can already do so , but only a few have made radical changes			0
one is @entity56 's @entity55 , which has five terms of eight weeks separated by two - week holidays , and a four or five - week summer break he added that there should be a ‘ time where children need to be children and have time to play ’			1
an @entity66 review of 39 studies in 1996 found that some researchers estimated that pupils lost between one and three months of learning over the summer			2
the problem was more marked in maths than reading , with disadvantaged pupils affected more than others			0
heads at the conference also pledged to press for mr @entity1 ’s reforms of gcses and a-levels to be overturned , saying they will wreak ‘ incalculable ’ damage on children ’s education			1
they are furious that coursework is being axed in most subjects in favour of written exams after two - year courses			0
@entity137 , head of @entity138 in @entity139 , said exams were at risk of becoming ‘ a feat of memory recall ’			0
@entity143 , head of @entity144 in @entity145 , said : ‘ i can not believe parents will want their children assessed exclusively by terminal exam , a once - and - only sitting of an exam at the end of a course			0
’ delegates unanimously passed a resolution calling for an urgent rethink of the changes , to be phased in from next year			0
the @entity157 rejected the criticisms , saying the reforms would ‘ address the pernicious damage caused by grade inflation and dumbing down ’ .			0
