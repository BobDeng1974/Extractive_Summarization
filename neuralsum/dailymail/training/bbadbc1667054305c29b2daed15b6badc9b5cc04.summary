@entity0 : rapper , record producer , businessman – and boxing promoter			1
the man more commonly known as @entity0 will be front and centre tonight as he hosts his first show at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
he will be joined at ringside by his wife @entity9 and pop star @entity10 while the voice of boxing , @entity13 , will announce the fights			1
and just hours before his first show , world super middleweight champion @entity23 announced he had joined @entity0 's company			1
@entity23 has been out of action for 14 months but tweeted : ' it 's official ! @entity29 to be part of the @entity32 family			0
' world super middleweight champion @entity23 ( pictured left with @entity0 ) has joined the rapper 's company but beyond the glamour and razzmatazz that will accompany the nine - fight card lies the story of a man desperate to make his mark in the sport of boxing			1
born and raised in @entity7 , @entity0 , now 45 , rose from a housing project in @entity45 to amass a fortune of $ 520million ( £ 344m )			1
along the way he sold one hundred million records , won nine @entity49 and is considered one of the greatest rappers of all time			0
his business interests include urban clothing company @entity54 , sports bar @entity57 in @entity7 and independent record label @entity58			1
he has bought and sold stakes in the @entity61 and the @entity63 basketball team and in 2013 launched sports agency @entity64 which is dedicated to ' elevating athletes ’ career on a global scale both on and off the field '			1
athletes currently signed include basketball player @entity69 , baseball ’s @entity70 and @entity74 footballers @entity72 and @entity75			0
but it is in boxing that he has attempted to make the biggest splash , although he has thus far encountered his fair share of barriers			2
@entity0 's first boxing show will be headlined by @entity15 and @entity16 @entity6 has played host to its fair share of iconic fights over the years eighteen months after forming the company , @entity0 appointed @entity87 as @entity64 ' chief operating officer			1
@entity87 held the same position at @entity91 's @entity90 until last summer and promised to make an ' immediate and dramatic impact on the sport '			0
he did just that the very next day , travelling to @entity94 with a cheque for $ 1,904,840 to bid for a middleweight world title fight between champion @entity97 and @entity98			0
@entity64 won the purse bid , offering $ 700,000 more than the next highest bid from @entity90			2
but @entity97 never did fight @entity98 , instead opting to vacate his title and wave goodbye to a $ 1.4m pay day			0
the answer to the obvious question of ' why ' lies in a bitter feud between @entity0 and the mysterious figure of @entity107 , boxing manager to the likes of @entity109 and @entity110			1
@entity107 , who does not give interviews , also has a background in music , promoting concerts involving the likes of @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			0
from rnb to rap and hip hop , @entity107 put on 500 shows in 1991 and by 2000 had made the move into boxing			0
he is believed to have crossed paths with @entity0 during his time in the music industry but was also named in a law suit filed by @entity9 ’s father in 2011			1
@entity97 ( left ) vacated his title rather than fight on a show promoted by @entity64 @entity0 made an offer to heavyweight knockout artist @entity134 ( left ) but the deal went unsigned @entity137 ( right ) turned down a $ 6m , multi-fight offer from @entity64 as well as @entity139 , @entity107 can count former world champions @entity140 and @entity142 , welterweight prospect @entity137 and heavyweight knockout sensation @entity134 among his clients			1
@entity64 reportedly offered @entity134 $ 2m for his upcoming fight with @entity147 belt holder @entity145 as part of a five - fight deal , only to remove the offer from the table after receiving no response			2
@entity137 , meanwhile , rejected a multi-fight deal worth $ 6m , telling @entity153 : ' @entity0 's company is a young company			2
i have n't seen them make guys money yet in boxing			0
' i want to see [ @entity0 ] do something with another fighter before i follow			2
i do n't want to fly on the first airplane			0
' that first plane will now take off tonight with a star name and earlier this week , @entity64 announced a merger with @entity165			1
@entity167 ’s roster includes heavyweight @entity168 who could fight @entity169 in @entity7 in april and former world champions @entity170 and @entity172			2
@entity107 aside , @entity0 's bold arrival on the boxing scene has been well received			1
veteran promoter @entity175 , who represents @entity176 , backed him to be a ‘ great success ’ while @entity91 welcomed ‘ @entity0 and @entity32 to the wonderful sport of boxing ’			1
@entity180 ( left ) joined forces with @entity109 ( right ) in 2012 but their relationship hit rock bottom @entity0 is not the first musician to dabble in boxing			2
@entity180 , aka @entity180 , formed @entity185 ( @entity186 ) with @entity139 in 2012 but the relationship lasted just a few months			0
he now promotes through his own company , @entity188 , but has only a handful of fighters signed , chiefly @entity192 lightweight @entity191			0
@entity180 's relationship with @entity139 is now seemingly beyond repair after an unsavoury exchange last year when the rapper claimed his former business partner could not read and insists he is owed $ 2m			0
in his memoir , decoded , @entity0 wrote : ‘ boxing is a glorious sport to watch and boxers are incredible , heroic athletes , but it 's also , to be honest , a stupid game to play			2
even the winners can end up with crippling brain damage			0
' but you learn something special from playing the most difficult games , the games where winning is close to impossible and losing is catastrophic			0
' it ’s too early to tell whether the man who once said he could sell water to a well will be one of boxing ’s winners , but where better to start than the place dreams are made of ?			0

@entity0 will promote his first boxing show in @entity7 tonight
he is doing so through his sports agency @entity64
@entity9 and @entity10 will also be ringside at @entity6
