by @entity0 published : 05:18 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 05:35 est , 2 march 2013 idea : music fan @entity2 created @entity3 over frustration at high ticket prices and empty seats at ' sold out ' events it is a situation which many people have been faced with			1
tickets to that all important event you are desperate to see are sold out			2
the only option left is to pay way over face value through secondary websites or touts			0
but that could all be about to change thanks to one of the @entity22 's fastest growing businesses			0
music fan @entity2 created @entity3 after he saw a fan offering to give away tickets to a show for free on @entity26 instead of letting them go to waste			1
the @entity30 - based web designer believed that other people with tickets to events which they were unable to attend would rather sell them to real fans at face value or less instead of through expensive secondary ticket websites			1
he went on to create @ @entity3 in 2011 with the rule that all tickets must be sold at face value or less			1
the business has so far allowed people to sell on 45,000 ' spare ' tickets to events			1
it follows anger rising in recent years over the cost of tickets through secondary websites such as @entity49 and @entity50 which mark up the price of tickets immediately after sale at the box office			0
this has allowed @entity3 to surge in popularity			2
mr @entity2 , 45 , said : ' first and foremost it was set up to reduce empty seats at events which were supposedly sold out			1
' i thought one of the reasons for that was because people can not exchange tickets at the last minute if they have a change of plans			0
' the other important thing is to ensure that fans are not being ripped off by overpriced tickets going spare by the expensive secondary ticket sites			2
' it has been phenomenal and everybody has been very supportive and positive			0
' this morning , tickets being offered for sale included @entity77 v @entity78 for a face value price of £ 35 and two spare tickets for a @entity82 concert tonight at the @entity83 for £ 50 each			1
success : twickets was created in 2011 with the rule that all tickets must be sold at face value or less bargain : two spare tickets for a @entity82 concert this evening at the @entity83 for being offered for £ 50 each this morning @entity93 tickets at the @entity94 which cost £ 110 on @entity49 cost just £ 42 on @entity3			1
while two tickets to see @entity96 at the @entity97 cost £ 110 on @entity3 compared to £ 293.15 on @entity49			2
last week a @entity100 app went on sale and topped the @entity103 new app chart with 30,000 downloads			0
its @entity26 page has almost 14,000 followers with fans constantly tweeting ticket offers			0
speaking to @entity109 , @entity111 mp @entity110 , who is campaigning to prevent ticket touts said : ' fans are being squeezed out of gigs and shows thanks to unscrupulous touts exploiting the talent of others			0
' @entity3 is what the secondary market should be about : true fans selling to true fans at face value			0

@entity2 created @entity3 after seeing a fan give away free tickets
he was frustrated at high ticket prices and empty seats at ' sold out ' events
business has *boomed* and enabled 45,000 ' spare ' tickets to be sold
