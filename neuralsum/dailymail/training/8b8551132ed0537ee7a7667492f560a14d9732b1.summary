by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:33 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 04:31 est , 28 december 2012 an ambitious @entity3 project to drill two miles under the @entity5 ice to look for signs of life has been abandoned			1
researchers said they were unable to create a large underwater cavity needed to circulate water to the team 's drill			1
it follows a last minute dash to send a spare part for the drill from @entity3 - which had allowed them to restart drilling			1
the team 's test drill hole			2
they now face a race against time to drill 2 miles into the ice to try and reach a frozen lake where they will look for signs of microbial life the team 's 12 scientists have been working around the clock to try and save the mission the malfunction could mean that the project , which took 16 years to plan , would have to be abandoned the first borehole was drilled to a depth of 300m and then left at that depth for 12 hours to create a cavity			1
the second , main borehole ( located 2m away from the first ) was then drilled to 300m depth and should have immediately connected with the first cavity			2
this main borehole would then continue through the cavity and down to the lake while the first borehole would be used to recirculate water back to the surface using a submersible pump			2
in this way , the ice cavity can be used to balance the level of water in the boreholes and hence balance the pressure from the lake upon breakthrough			1
for reasons that are yet to be determined the team could not establish a link between the two boreholes at 300m depth , despite trying for over 20 hours			2
during this process , hot water seeped into the porous surface layers of ice and was lost			2
the team attempted to replenish this water loss by digging and melting more snow , but their efforts could not compensate			0
the additional time taken to attempt to establish the cavity link significantly depleted the fuel stocks to such a level as to render the remaining operation unviable			0
reluctantly the team had no option but to discontinue the programme for this season			0
' in the early hours of christmas day professor @entity74 , principal investigator of the @entity76 experiment , confirmed that the mission to drill into the lake has been called off for this @entity5 season , ' the @entity73 said			1
drilling was proceeding well during the weekend after a replacement part was fitted to the boiler used to heat water for drilling			0
however , @entity85 stopped after the team was unable to form properly the water - filled cavity 300 metres beneath the ice			1
this cavity was to link the main borehole with a secondary borehole used to recirculate drilling water back to the surface			1
' on christmas eve we took the decision to cease our efforts to directly measure and sample @entity76 , ' said professor @entity74			1
' although circumstances have not worked out as we would have wished , i am confident that through the huge efforts of the field team , and our colleagues in the @entity3 , we have done as much as we possibly could have done , and i sincerely thank them all			1
' i am also hugely grateful to the @entity3 @entity105 for making it possible for us to attempt the direct exploration of subglacial @entity108			1
' sixteen years ago , we hypothesised that deep - water subglacial lakes are viable habitats for life , and contain important records of ice and climate history			1
for now , these hypotheses remain untested			0
once back in the @entity3 i will gather our consortium to seek ways in which our research efforts may continue			1
i remain confident that we will unlock the secrets of @entity76 in coming seasons			0
' the project was also hit by mechanical problems			0
the drill is powered by hot water , but was halted when the resister inside a boiler burned out			0
a spare was sent from @entity3 via @entity128 to the remote camp in @entity108			1
twelve scientists from the @entity73 have worked around the clock over the past fortnight to bore 10,000ft down to ice - locked @entity76 to collect samples of water and sediment			1
aerial view of the site , where the the 12 scientists , from the @entity73 , are now in a race against time to complete the mission drill testing at the base , where staff now face a race against time the 12 scientists , from the @entity73 , are now in a race against time to complete the mission before the borehole reseals as they only have enough fuel for one attempt they hope to find unique microbial life forms there which have been isolated for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer			0
however , the team has vowed to return			1
this is of course , hugely frustrating for us , but we have learned a lot this year , ' said professor @entity74			0
' by the end the equipment was working well , and much of it has now been fully field tested			0
' a full report on the field season will be compiled when the engineers and programme manager return to @entity3			1
the bas team have been trying to melt their way down to @entity76 using a 2 mile - long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to @entity172 at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch			1
drilling preparations for the team , who admit that they only have one more chance to complete the project the drill site in situe of the @entity76 mountains			2
the £ 7million project to drill beneath two miles of @entity5 ice in search of undiscovered life hangs in the balance - after a major equipment failure			2
the @entity76 drill site on the @entity5 ice sheet : four @entity3 scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000ft of ice for queen and country : the mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent one of more than 400 sub-glacial lakes in @entity108 , @entity208 is equivalent in size to the @entity3 's @entity211 , measuring 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide , and nearly 500ft deep			1
completely cut off from any light from the @entity213 , any life lurking beneath its waters must endure complete darkness , intense pressure and subzero temperatures			0
it is only geothermal heat from the @entity222 's core and the intense pressure exerted by the weight of the ice above that has kept it liquid			0
should any organisms be found living in its icy depths , they could offer tantalising clues as to how life might look elsewhere in the solar system , such as in the ice - covered oceans of @entity237 's @entity236			2
expedition leader @entity238 confirmed they were past the point of no return and feared the water would re-freeze in the pipes and borehole , halting the programme			0
a plane unloading fuel at the site staff at the site working on the project 's test drill holes the bas team planned first to bore down to 1,000ft , then stop to create a cavity , then drill a second borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way down to the lake			2
the cavity is what controls the pressure of the liquid being drawn from @entity76 , stopping a geyser of prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and spilling out over the surface of the ice			2
once they reach the waters , they will have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense uv light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before the hole refreezes again			0
technology : the @entity73 team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile - long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to @entity172 at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch @entity76 is one of 200 subglacial lakes in the @entity5 : equivalent in size to the @entity3 's @entity211 , it measures 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide , and is nearly 500ft deep the location of @entity76 on the @entity5 ice sheet : it is just one of 400 subglacial lakes detected beneath the ice of the frozen southern continent @entity238 , a @entity73 engineer who is heading the programme , spoke earlier this month to the @entity298 by phone from his tent on the @entity5 ice sheet			1
' it 's bloody cold , ' he said			0
the team will spent six weeks at the site , where temperatures , according to the @entity73 , are @entity305 , with winds of 20 knots			0
for much of that time they will work around the clock			0
' @entity76 principal investigator @entity74 from the @entity311 said : ' this @entity3 mission is part of an international effort to discover and explore subglacial lake environments			2
team effort : the 12 - man team have been working around the clock to shovel snow to feed their hot - water drill - until the boiler frustratingly malfunctioned inhospitable : the team have been battling against freezing cold weather to complete their mission ambitious : intrepid engineers and scientists from the @entity73 have been trying to drill two miles to an ice - locked lake deep beneath the glaciers of the western @entity5 ' we are about to explore the unknown and i am very excited that our mission will advance our scientific understanding of @entity108 ’s hidden world			1
' right now we are working round the clock in a cold , demanding and extreme location – it ’s testing our own personal endurance , but it is entirely worth it			0
' the technical difficulties are something that are not unfamiliar in @entity108 - it 's a hostile environment and very difficult to do things smoothly			0
' the good news is that we found the fault relatively early on in our deployment system and so we have quite a lot of fuel that is left remaining			0
' if we did n't have that of course we would n't be able to continue any further			0
' video @entity3 team toil to break through two miles of @entity108 ice			1

team made decision on christmas day following problems forming cavities under the ice
resistor sent *15,000km* from @entity3 allowed team to restart drilling - but they could not form a ' linking ' cavity under the ice
researchers vow to return next year
