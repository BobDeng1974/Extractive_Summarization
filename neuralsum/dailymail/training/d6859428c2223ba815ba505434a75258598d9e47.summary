@entity1 international @entity0 looks destined to return to @entity2 when his loan at @entity4 expires next month after @entity5 suggested the 19 - year - old may be finding it difficult to adapt to the top flight			1
@entity0 arrived at @entity9 on transfer deadline day hoping to impress @entity12 boss @entity11 and show he could break the mould by being a @entity2 academy product worthy of regular first - team consideration			1
but in the week that 18 - year - old @entity17 's senior debut earned so much attention , a man who once made the @entity2 bench at 15 is struggling to build on the early hype which surrounded him			0
@entity0 ( centre ) , currently on loan at @entity4 , looks set to return to @entity2 in january @entity25 is yet to start a game under @entity5 and has played just 66 minutes in total , 45 of which came in the 4 - 0 drubbing at @entity29			1
he has played no part in the @entity4 ' last five games and after confirming there is no injury concern over @entity35 , @entity5 admitted the @entity37 's unforgiving nature has limited the teenager 's opportunities			1
' he 's a young player learning , earning his spurs and developing , and this is a tough league to do all those things in and do them every week , ' said the @entity4 manager			2
' behind the scenes he 's working hard and should he get his chance , he 'll be ready to take it			0
' yet when asked whether @entity25 would be returning to @entity47 when his loan culminates in january , @entity5 simply replied : ' we 'll wait and see			1
we 'll stumble across that bridge when we have to			0
' @entity5 suggested that @entity25 was perhaps not quite ready for @entity37 football at this stage @entity25 's @entity1 team - mate @entity53 has made more of an impression during his loan stay , though			1
the @entity57 defender initially had to bide his time to break into the line - up but , with @entity60 sidelined by a calf injury , @entity53 has now started three games in a row			0
however , while @entity5 may be interested in extending @entity53 's stay beyond january , the injury crisis which has blighted his parent club could mean @entity67 is reluctant to agree to such terms			1
' for a young man going into the @entity37 he 's done well and i thought he was very good at @entity71 , ' @entity5 added			1
' with @entity72 - he 's done well this season - so it was a case of picking on form			0
now @entity75 comes in and he 's done well , so it will be interesting when we 've got everyone fit			0
' @entity25 has 21 caps for the @entity1 under 21 side , and has also played for the @entity1 16 , 17 and 19 sides it is in central midfield , @entity25 's usual position , that @entity5 has pinpointed as an area he will target when the transfer window opens up again			1
the likes of @entity88 and @entity89 were linked with the @entity4 over the summer but both signed new deals at their respective clubs and @entity5 is ready to go looking for another midfield maestro			2
' we 're looking to strengthen with the right players , ' he said			0
' there 's certain areas that we possibly need to build further than others			0
we 've not got great depth in central midfield			0
' it 's supply and demand , availability of players and the ones that fit the team but also the financial model of the club			0
' there will be finance , we know that , but we 've already seen the finance involved in the @entity37 is considerable and it 's how far the club want to go towards affecting the situation , if and when the right player comes available			2
' @entity0 headed to @entity4 looking to impress @entity11 but has only played 66 minutes in total			2

@entity0 is on loan at @entity4 from @entity2
but the young midfielder could be set for a return to his parent club
@entity5 said @entity25 has struggled to adapt to the @entity37
but @entity5 was impressed with @entity125 loanee @entity53
