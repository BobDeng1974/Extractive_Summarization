@entity1 scientists could have found the key to wiping out malaria - carrying mosquitoes - by developing a genetically modified species that produces just male offspring			1
malaria is spread by infected female mosquitoes who pass on the killer disease when they bite humans			1
but @entity11 researchers looked to genetics to disrupt the breeding of mosquitoes so fewer females are produced , which should see mosquitoes die out within a few generations			2
in lab tests they have modified mosquitoes to produce sperm that will only create males , pioneering a fresh approach to eradicating malaria			2
genetically modified mosquitoes that almost exclusively produce male offspring could wipe out malaria the new genetic method distorts the sex ratio of @entity28 mosquitoes , the main transmitters of the malaria parasite			1
in the first laboratory tests , the method created a fully fertile mosquito strain that produced 95 per cent male offspring , the study published in the journal @entity33 revealed			1
these were introduced to five caged wild - type mosquito populations			2
in four of the five cages , this eliminated the entire population within six generations , because of the lack of females			2
the hope is that if this could be replicated in the wild , this would ultimately cause the malaria - carrying mosquito population to crash			1
this is the first time that scientists have been able to manipulate the sex ratios of mosquito populations			0
since the millennium increased prevention and control measures have reduced global malaria mortality rates by 42 per cent , but the disease remains a prevalent killer especially in vulnerable @entity63 regions			2
malaria control has also been threatened by the spread of insecticide resistant mosquitoes and malaria parasites resistant to drugs			1
releasing the @entity70 mosquitoes into the wild could lead to the extinction of disease - carrying mosquitoes			1

professor @entity82 from the @entity83 said : ' malaria is debilitating and often fatal and we need to find new ways of tackling it			0
we think our innovative approach is a huge step forward			0
' for the very first time , we have been able to inhibit the production of female offspring in the laboratory and this provides a new means to eliminate the disease			1
' colleague dr @entity96 added : ' what is most promising about our results is that they are self - sustaining			0
' once modified mosquitoes are introduced , males will start to produce mainly sons , and their sons will do the same , so essentially the mosquitoes carry out the work for us			0
' in this new experiment the scientists inserted a dna cutting enzyme called @entity110 into anopheles gambiae mosquitoes			0
in normal reproduction , half of the sperm bear the x chromosome and will produce female offspring , and the other half bear the y chromosome and produce male offspring			1
the enzyme that the researchers used works by cutting the dna of the x chromosome during production of sperm , so that almost no functioning sperm carry the female x chromosome			0
as a result the offspring of the genetically modified mosquitoes was almost exclusively male			1
it took the researchers six years to produce an effective variant of the enzyme			0
dr @entity133 said : ' the research is still in its early days , but i am really hopeful that this new approach could ultimately lead to a cheap and effective way to eliminate malaria from entire regions			0
' our goal is to enable people to live freely without the threat of this deadly disease			0

95 *%* of eggs laid by the @entity70 mosquitoes hatch into male offspring
if they were released into the wild , they could wipe out disease - carrying insects by *denying* them the *opportunity* to breed through lack of females
it could even lead to the extinction of disease - carrying mosquitoes
malaria is spread by disease - infected female mosquitoes who bite humans
