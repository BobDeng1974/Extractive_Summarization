a student who took ‘ thinspiration selfies ’ to track her dramatic weight loss has spoken out to warn others of the dangers			1
@entity5 , 17 , took pictures of her shrinking frame as motivation to continue to lose more weight			1
the teenager from @entity11 , @entity12 , uploaded the pictures onto a password protected blog , which acted as a diary for her to monitor her progress			1
after battling anorexia she is now healthy ( pictured right ) the teenager from @entity11 , @entity12 , uploaded the pictures onto a password protected blog , which acted as a diary for her to monitor her progress			1
she is pictured here with her parents , having regained some of the weight she lost from skipping meals when she reached six stone , miss @entity36 was on the verge of being hospitalised for the second time , but something finally ‘ clicked ’ and she began to regain weight			1
she is now a healthy 8st 5lbs			1
‘ it 's scary to think that by taking all those pictures i was putting my life on the line , ’ she said			0
‘ it was just very important to me to document my weight loss - and ensure i was n't putting on any weight			2
‘ i took photos all the time at lots of different angles , and then i 'd post them on a private blog to keep track of everything			2
‘ i 'm just so glad i 'm in a much better place in my life now and do n't have to do that any more , i feel really positive			0
’ miss @entity36 first began taking photos of herself in the summer of 2011			1
‘ i decided that i needed a way to track my weight , and i wanted to be able to notice a difference , ’ she explained			2
miss @entity36 's mother , @entity61 , said : ‘ @entity5 had always been very slim so it was a while before i realised something was wrong			1
it was so difficult to watch her go through it - we just could n't get her to eat ' ‘ if i saw in the picture that i was thinner , it made me feel really good , but i was very critical and i 'd always think that i needed to lose more weight			1
‘ i even had the pictures on my phone so that i could look at them when i was away from home			0
it became quite important to me			0
’ miss @entity36 first began suffering from an eating disorder at the age of 14 , after she fell out with a group of friends at her school			1
‘ rumours had been started about me and it took over my life very quickly , ’ she said			0
‘ after that it got to the point where if i could n't control how people felt about me or what they said , the one thing i could control was my eating			2
’ at her lightest , she weighed just six stone			0
as well as having issues with food , miss @entity36 exercised compulsively			1
she has now gained more than 2st and is a healthy 8st 5lb ( right ) anorexia nervosa is often cited as the most lethal mental illness - with a larger ratio sufferers dying than those who have depression or psychosis			1
sufferers tend to focus on food but the illness itself stems from low self - esteem and an inability to cope safely with worries , problems and a lack of control			0
many who have anorexia lower their food intake by skipping meals and cutting down the types and amounts of food they eat ; some over-exercise			0
aside from catastrophically severe weight loss , physical symptoms include difficulty sleeping , dizziness , stomach pains , constipation , feeling cold and hair loss			2
periods can stop for women and sufferers grow soft , fine hair all over their bodies in a condition called @entity131			0
although researchers are given figures by hospitals around @entity136 , it is thought the real toll of sufferers could be much higher because many are reluctant to seek help			0
one symptom is that sufferers shut themselves off from the world and convince themselves that what they are doing is right , even if they are dangerously underweight			0
nine out of ten people with an eating disorder are women - but @entity152 figures suggest there is a growing number of male sufferers			1
specialists tend to use psychological treatments such as counselling , though the most severe cases have to be treated in hospital to ensure patients regain weight safely			2
sources : @entity164 / @entity152 ‘ i began to compulsively exercise - if i did n't i 'd have trouble sleeping			2
‘ at my worst i began to self - harm too , it was all just so out of control			0
’ she reached out for help before the disorder took hold by writing a letter to her mother explaining how she was feeling			1
@entity177 , 54 , booked her daughter a doctor ’s appointment , but the doctor suggested that @entity5 should come back in a month , during which time her condition worsened and a school nurse noticed miss @entity36 ’s dramatic weight loss			1
she was referred to her local @entity185 - and was diagnosed with anorexia in december 2011			0
after being hospitalised in may 2012 , she was discharged but continued to lose weight			1
‘ by february last year i was n't allowed to go to school and i realised i just did n't want to go to hospital again , ' says miss @entity5			1
' something clicked and i realised that was no point in losing all this weight			2
‘ i 've found it difficult to stay at a healthy weight - and sometimes i do have my bad days - but i 've come a really long way , ’ she added			2
her mother said : ‘ @entity5 had always been very slim so it was a while before i realised something was wrong			1
‘ it was so difficult to watch her go through it - we went on holiday and it was so stressful as we could n't get her to eat			0
' sometimes i could n't believe how sneaky she was , as she would lie to avoid eating			0
it changed her personality and for a short time she was n't my @entity5 anymore , but i would say that we 're even closer now than we were before			2
‘ i still worry about her but we 've agreed that if she 's ever feeling unsure or anxious , that she must tell me before things get out of control			0
‘ i 've never looked at the pictures she 's taken , and i do n't think i really want too			0
i 'm just very proud of her for coming through this			0
