by @entity0 published : 17:59 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:32 est , 27 february 2014 unrepentant : @entity0 has no regrets about sleeping with a married man exactly a year ago , i instigated the end of one of the most fulfilling , exciting and enduring relationships of my life , by dumping my lover of 12 years			1
there was no drama , accusations or poisonous words exchanged			0
instead , we 'd just made love and were lying in my bed with a cup of tea when i casually mentioned we should n't see each other any more			1
@entity21 finished his tea , dressed , kissed me goodbye and walked out of my life			1
i have n't seen him since			1
it was without doubt one of the most selfless and generous things i have ever done			0
by finishing with @entity21 , a married father of a little boy , i was setting him free to be the good husband i knew he could be			1
this was n't done out of a sense of guilt or propriety : i 'd been sleeping with @entity21 before and after his marriage			1
i did it for the sake of his son , who deserved his father 's full attention , and i did it for @entity38 i sensed he was finally ready to put his indecisive , philandering ways behind him and devote himself to his family			1
though sad to see him go , i did n't regret my decision			1
i 'd always seen our time together as a loan which eventually would have to be called in			0
and that 's why i never had any regrets about deceiving his wife			1
as i saw it , i 'd borrowed someone 's fiance , then husband , and returned him with interest			0
if it were n't for our affair , i 'm sure he 'd still be dithering about whether to marry and would n't have started a family			1
in fact , so encouraging was i that he commit to marriage and family life with another woman that i ca n't help thinking my lover 's wife owes some of her happiness to me			1
i met @entity21 when he was 30 and i was 47 , after a mutual friend invited us for a drink one evening			1
i 'd been divorced for five years following the collapse of my 12 - year marriage			1
my former husband had gone to live in the @entity72 after meeting someone on a work trip ; our sons were just three and six when he left			0
since my sons had specific learning difficulties and needed a lot of extra help , my time was taken up with looking after them			0
i 'd gone on some dates and remained hopeful that romance was n't over for me , though it was n't at the top of my list of priorities			2
so , i could hardly believe my luck when @entity21 walked into the bar			1
he was tall and broad with thick , curly hair and green eyes : good - looking and smiley			2
i was n't remotely worried by the fact he was so much younger than me			2
toy boy : @entity0 was 47 when she started her affair with @entity21 , who was 17 years younger than her i like to think i am an attractive woman and i know age is seldom an obstacle when two people are attracted to each other			1
besides , older women bring something very different to a relationship			0
without the ticking of a biological clock , we tend to be more relaxed than younger women about relationships			0
that night , there was a definite chemistry			0
i had to get back home early to relieve the babysitter , but i gave @entity21 my number			1
a week or so later , we met for coffee and things developed from there			2
his job in @entity115 meant he worked flexible hours , so he was able to visit me when my sons were at school			0
in many ways i was using @entity38 he was an ego boost , a distraction , a nice couple of hours out of my life now and then it was n't just a physical relationship , though , of course , that was important			2
a typical afternoon for us involved a cup of tea , some time in bed and a catch - up on our news and problems			2
@entity21 was always happy to talk about my sons , while i gave him general life advice			1
i never hoped or assumed the relationship would go any further			0
in fact , @entity21 put it perfectly one afternoon a year after we met : ' you 're 17 years older , so nothing long - term is going to happen			1
let 's just enjoy it for what it is , for as long as it lasts			0
' ever the pragmatist , i was happy to agree			0
after all , we were at different stages in life			0
did i love him ? yes , at first i suppose i did a little bit , but as time passed , i came to see him for what he was : a charming and handsome man , but ultimately an unfaithful and immature one			2
i knew he 'd drive me nuts if i lived with him because he was a ditherer and seemed incapable of committing to a long - term relationship			2
i know people are going to assume i was being used , but i do n't see it that way			2
in many ways i was using @entity38 he was an ego boost , a distraction , a nice couple of hours out of my life now and then			0
we agreed we were free to date other people , and we did			0
i knew @entity21 wanted to marry and have a family			1
my priority was my sons			0
a new relationship would have been wonderful , but it is n't easy to find that when you are a full - time parent without any weekends off			1
i also came to see that the reason my relationship with @entity21 worked so well was that we avoided the mundane and domestic			1
brief encounters : @entity0 said she enjoyed her physical relationship with @entity21 which was not encumbered with @entity181 ( posed by models ) @entity183 never bred contempt because we only saw each other in a succession of brief romantic encounters			1
he never met my sons ; i never asked about his girlfriends			2
i felt no jealousy or resentment			0
my time with @entity21 was more than enough for me			1
in 2009 , i knew , from the scant information i received from him that @entity21 had started seeing someone seriously and they 'd moved in together			1
i was surprised he still wanted to carry on with our arrangement			0
i could see what i got out of it , but why was he keen to keep seeing me when he had a girlfriend at home ? his answer was simple : ' i just need to			0
' i saw that as a sign of his immaturity and unwillingness to commit			0
thank @entity207 i 'm his mistress , not his partner , i thought			0
obviously he needed more than his wife could give him and i did n't pose a threat to his marriage the relationship did have its pauses , sometimes for several months , as @entity21 dithered over the direction his life was taking			1
it was during a break in 2010 that i received a text that he 'd married his girlfriend			2
he 'd never even told me they were engaged , but in my heart i was n't surprised			2
i knew it was what he wanted , though i did n't have high hopes for the future of his relationship			2
part of me felt sorry for the poor woman			2
i was surprised , however , when several months later he called to suggest we meet up			0
it was curiosity , in part , that made me agree			0
i know many will argue that i should have reminded him of the vows he had taken only months earlier , but knowing @entity21 as i did , i knew he 'd blunder into another clandestine affair - possibly with a woman less discreet and trustworthy than me			1
so , he came round and we ended up in bed			0
we did n't discuss the wedding or his wife			1
we just picked up where we 'd left off several months before			0
i never saw @entity21 's marriage as my moral issue , it was his			1
if he took chances , that was his problem			0
obviously he needed more than his wife could give him and i did n't pose a threat to his marriage			1
one day in the summer of 2011 , @entity21 asked for my advice			1
he said his wife , who was 37 , wanted to start a family			1
but he was n't sure			2
advised him to start a family : the mother - of - two believes she has made her lover a better husband exasperated , i urged him to get on with it			1
time and biology waits for no man , i said , and he could end up regretting not being a father for the rest of his life			2
their son , @entity264 , was born within the year			2
a few months later , he was back in my bed			0
our snuggly , post-coital chat involved him complaining that he had no time for himself			0
life was all work and looking after mother and baby , he grumbled			2
i reassured him that it might seem like an endless slog at that point , but it would pass and that he and his wife would one day have fun together again			0
i told him he was doing well and explained that my former husband and i had slept in separate rooms for six months after our first son was born			0
@entity21 said he felt much better after hearing how life as a new parent had been for me			1
the next time i saw him , he was much happier			0
he had bonded with his son and seemed to have taken a giant leap into manhood , so determined was he to do the best for his new family			0
he was proud of his wife and child , and i was delighted to see he 'd found his stride as a family man			1
the time was right to cut him loose and make him commit			0
i saw our relationship as the last piece in the puzzle			0
his little boy needed @entity21 in a way i did n't			1
it was only fair on them to force his hand			0
that was a year ago			0
i miss him , occasionally , but i sincerely hope he is making a go of family life and is happy			0
do i feel regret or guilt ? no - far from being the villain of the piece , i see myself as a fairy godmother			1
i think @entity21 's affair with me did his marriage the world of good .			1

@entity0 met @entity21 when she was 47 and he was 30
she was a divorced mother - of - two
during their 12 - year fling , he met and married another woman
@entity0 does n't feel guilty about sleeping with a married man
she encouraged him to start a family with his wife
