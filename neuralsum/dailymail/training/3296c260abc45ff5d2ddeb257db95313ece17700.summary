by @entity0 the sound of my newborn son ’s cries filtered through the floorboards , stinging my ears and piercing my heart			1
but i dare n’t go to him			2
he was in the possessive grasp of my mother - in - law , who ’d placed an exclusion zone of fierce grandmotherly love around him , barring all from going near			1
‘ @entity21 ’ was here , and she gripped @entity17 to her chest and peered at me , her coal - black eyes filled with a direct challenge			1
it was a high - noon stand - off			1
‘ mine ’ she seemed to say , as she cooed at him			2
so began one of the most painful weeks of my life , one which still smarts now when i think about it , and which pushed my relationship with my husband , @entity32 , to the brink			1
devoted : @entity0 's son jonas with his grandma @entity35 to this day , i still feel hurt and resentful when i recall how my first weeks of motherhood were tainted by the interference of my @entity39 mother - in - law , @entity35			1
she made me feel superfluous , useless and inferior — that i was nothing more than a uterus that had delivered her first - born grandson			1
and a second - rate uterus , at that			1
maybe it was partly down to the clash of cultures			1
@entity21 is from @entity49 , and speaks barely a word of @entity51 , and i speak no @entity39			2
maybe it was also because she ’d been widowed at 26 : @entity32 , her youngest , was just 18 months old when his father was killed in a car crash , leaving her to raise her three children single - handedly			1
it had left her fiercely proud of her family , as well as being very critical of their partners			1
from the ruinous state of my post-baby body to the way i held my son , i fell short in every department			2
and @entity32 , the devoted mamma ’s boy , seemed to accept her word on everything , excluding me as they gabbled in their own language			1
whenever i hear friends complain about how little help they get from their in - laws , i want to shout how lucky they are			1
feeling pushed to the side : @entity0 ( left ) with her partner @entity78 and his mother ' @entity21 ' with one of their daughters i ’d been a mother for just eight days when she came sweeping through the door of our home in @entity87 , @entity88 , and literally wrenched @entity17 from my arms			1
taken aback at her forthrightness , i tried to put it down to excitement			2
he was , after all , her first grandchild			2
yet as she clutched @entity17 to her chest , ignoring me , my heart pounded in panic			2
although logically , i knew he was safe , a new mother ’s protective hormones turn her into a lioness			1
i would have fought and killed for @entity17			2
the trouble was , so would @entity21			0
but instead of standing up to my mother - in - law , i went upstairs and wept			1
looking back , i ca n’t believe i was so weak , so unassertive			0
i can only put it down to the shock i felt at having a domineering stranger barge into my life			0
first grandchild : the way @entity21 ( pictured ) acted with baby @entity17 made mother @entity0 feel panicked this was her first visit to our home			1
although i ’d met her a few times in @entity39 , we ’d never got beyond small - talk due to the language barrier			1
although she ’d never said it , i wondered if she blamed me for luring her son to another country			0
@entity32 and i had met on a skiing trip in 2004			1
he was my instructor and we quickly recognised that our laughter on the slopes was the start of something more meaningful			0
he moved to @entity127 a year later , and set up his own house refurbishment business			0
but it was n’t until i gave birth that i realised the true character of my mother - in - law			1
from the outset of her visit , she made it clear that ‘ @entity21 knows best ’			1
and @entity32 did nothing to correct her			1
she was constantly hurling ‘ advice ’ on everything from feeding to sleeping			0
everything she did contradicted modern parenting advice : she put @entity17 on his tummy to sleep and swaddled him in layers and layers of blankets			0
i even had to stop her feeding him camomile tea			0
since when did a newborn baby need tea ? ‘ it ’s just how they did things in her day , ’ @entity32 said , as @entity35 stropped off			1
of course , my husband ran after her to console her , rather than me			0
more than 60 per cent of women say their relationship with their mother - in - law makes them stressed breastfeeding became my only solace , the only time @entity17 was all mine			1
even then , she ’d stand so close that i felt inhibited and self - conscious			2
once , she unexpectedly yanked up my top , revealing my postnatal belly			0
‘ @entity163 ! ’ she remarked ( what a stomach ! )			0
@entity167 , @entity32 and i hissed at each other			1
i was sick of being undermined and humiliated			0
in my worst moments , i wanted to run away with my baby			0
her week - long visit eventually ended , but the effect on @entity78 ’s and my relationship reverberated for long after			2
despite the tension , she would arrive at our door every three months without fail and stay for a week			0
‘ you ca n’t stop me seeing my mother ! ’ @entity32 would fume			1
‘ she ca n’t stop me from being a mother ! ’ i would retort			2
i loved him , but there were times when i wondered if i ’d be better off alone			0
when i went on to give birth to two daughters — daisy in 2010 and @entity188 in 2013 — i felt stronger and more in control			0
yet still @entity21 flew in to undermine me			0
i had to justify everything i did , from not putting salt in my children ’s food , to not letting them ‘ sweat out ’ a fever to ( gasp ) letting them run around barefoot — a scandalous offence , as she believed colds are caused by floors , not viruses			0
happy family : nonna with her grandchildren @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity17 during one of @entity21 ’s visits , i left her to give @entity187 and @entity188 breakfast , while i took @entity17 to school			2
i got back to find both children triumphantly sucking @entity211 biscuits , having clearly ignored the cereal , toast and eggs on offer			0
she knew my views on this			0
biscuits were a treat , not breakfast			0
‘ no biscotti ! ’ i said , at which she and the children just smirked conspiratorially			0
it was only when my youngest , @entity188 , turned 18 months — the age @entity32 had been when his father died — that relations between us started to thaw			1
one day , exhausted and stressed , trying to juggle work , money and the family , i tried to imagine being responsible for these three little ones all on my own			0
how did @entity35 manage it , producing such a loving , loyal and well - adjusted son as @entity32 ? not so bad after all : nonna with her grandson @entity17 suddenly , the thought of @entity35 ’s next visit did n’t feel quite so much as an invasion , but a welcome extra pair of loving hands			1
the children clearly adore their @entity21 , and love chatting in her native language			2
and i ’ve been making an effort to improve my @entity39 too , so i do n’t feel so @entity245 ’ve also stocked the biscuit barrel , am practising my vocabulary and am determined to grit my teeth			1
maybe we can start again			0
strong family ties : @entity21 and baby @entity188 i have no recollection of my father			0
he died far too soon and my mother sacrificed everything to give me , my brother and sister a good upbringing			2
it ’s no surprise , then , that i will always love and admire her			0
after @entity17 was born , i could n’t wait to share the experience with my mother			2
so i could n’t understand why @entity0 felt so threatened			1
that first visit was a nightmare			0
@entity21 just wanted to get to know her grandson , but @entity0 could n’t bear to share him			1
somehow she thought she was trying to steal him			0
she could n’t see how ridiculous that was or disrespectful to my mother ’s feelings			2
after all , she was only visiting us for a week			0
i could n’t help but feel that all this highlighted the massive cultural gaps between @entity51 and @entity39			2
back home , families are much stronger , there ’s none of this ‘ not interfering ’ business			0
i felt like a hostage , stuck in a field between two raging bulls			0
it did n’t help that @entity281 and @entity0 did n’t speak the same language			1
not only was i torn between two different cultures , i was constantly having to translate for them , too			0
i love @entity0 — and my mother			1
i just hope , over time , they will learn to love each other .			0

mother - in - law @entity35 made mother @entity0 feel superfluous and inferior
culture clash and a language barrier left them unable to *communicate*
@entity35 was critical of @entity0 's every move
@entity32 did *n't* understand , making @entity0 want to be alone
