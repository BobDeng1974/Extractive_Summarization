they also say that the passwords for the 45,000 accounts could be used by the cybercriminals to break into email services			0
anyone who uses the same password across several web services is at risk			0
@entity42 estimates that 69 per cent of infected computers are in the @entity14			0
' worm ' is a technical term for malicious software made by hackers which can spread itself without human help - making worms potentially more dangerous than viruses , which only spread through innocent - looking but infected files			0
security company @entity42 , which tracked the attack , says , ' @entity42 has discovered that @entity18 recently started targeting @entity4 accounts with considerable success , stealing over 45,000 @entity4 login credentials worldwide , mostly from people in the @entity14 and @entity55			2
' ' we suspect that the attackers behind @entity18 are using the stolen credentials to log in to victims ' @entity4 accounts and to transmit malicious links to their friends , thereby helping it spread even further			1

the recent infection was tracked by security company @entity42 , who tracked the ' command and control ' servers used to send commands to remote - control computers infected with @entity18			2
computers infected with malicious software often ' wait ' for commands from the hackers who have infected them			0
in the case of @entity18 , the server that sends the commands is well known , ' since the @entity4 command - and - control site is visible and accessible it was fairly straightforward to detect that over 45,000 @entity4 login credentials have been stolen worldwide , mostly from users in the @entity14 and @entity55			1
