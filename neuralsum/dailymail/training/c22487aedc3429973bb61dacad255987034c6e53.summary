by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 head coach @entity2 is hoping one of the men he inherited can be his most important ' new signing '			1
@entity8 international @entity7 was already at the @entity9 in october last year when @entity2 was parachuted in and charged with the task of dragging the @entity3 out of desperate relegation trouble			1
however , the Â£ 6.5million signing from @entity13 struggled to command a place in the @entity16 's team as he gradually plotted a route to @entity19 safety			2
@entity3 midfielder @entity7 ( right ) is pictured in action against @entity21 @entity3 boss @entity2 , pictured in training , believes @entity7 will improve this season but far from sulk and look for a way out of @entity25 , @entity7 has returned and redoubled his efforts to catch the head coach 's eye , and has done just that			1
@entity2 said : ' i see him as a new player , a totally new player			1
it was difficult for him to play with us last year for different reasons , not only because of him , me picking the team in a certain way , not finding that position for him in the team regularly			2
' he did well for a period in november , december when he was playing wide , but he did n't score and we needed something else , and it did n't work			2
' then he came back in pre-season in an incredible way - he was outstanding , one of the top three players in everything			2
he was playing well , he was pushing for a start , and he got injured			0
' then he came back sooner than expected			0
he has played two 90 minutes with @entity8 , which is very difficult - only 11 players can start for @entity8 , a great national team , and he is one of them , which is fantastic			0
' the idea is to use him and to make sure that if he picks himself , that will be to the benefit of the team			0
i am very happy with @entity7 , he looks like a totally new player			1
' @entity3 remain a work in progress after yet another significant rebuilding programme with nine new faces having arrived during the summer transfer window and by @entity2 's own admission , gaps still to plug			1
@entity8 international @entity7 ( right ) plays head tennis with team - mate @entity68 ( left ) former @entity69 manager @entity2 ( right ) gets fully involved in a training session with his players in the circumstances , he is still working to forge a coherent method with his new - look team , although he insists there is nothing complicated about the bottom line			1
he said : ' it 's quite simple : the goalkeeper needs to make saves and if he saves every ball , we do n't concede ; and the striker , if he puts the ball in the net , we are going to win plenty of games			0
' those two roles are clear			0
they are unfair , sometimes - the goalkeeper saves every single ball , but makes one mistake and it 's a bad one , and the striker , the opposite - but it 's simple			0
' the rest , they have got different responsibilities			0
it 's a great challenge for the offensive players at this club to become the top scorer , the one who is going to score double figures and is going to be the important one week in , week out			0
' @entity2 's work to date will be put to the test on saturday when former club @entity107 arrive at the @entity9 for a game the @entity109 knows will test his players to the full			1
@entity111 brings his @entity107 team to the @entity9 to face @entity3 on saturday he said : ' last year , we were destroyed by @entity107 , especially away			1
even at home , it was one of my darkest days here , i did n't like it at all , the way we played against @entity107 in the second half at the @entity9			1
' they have got quality , they are a very interesting team			0
with a new manager , they are going to make it difficult and we need to be spot - on , we need to be good			2
' sometimes , i say to the players , ' okay is not enough , you need to be better than okay ' , and this is a game where we need to be better			0

@entity2 believes @entity7 looks like ' a totally new player '
the @entity133 international struggled to nail down a regular spot last season
but @entity2 thinks he can star for the @entity3 this season
