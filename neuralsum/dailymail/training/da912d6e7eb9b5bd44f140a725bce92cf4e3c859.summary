a senator 's town hall meeting in @entity3 , @entity0 was called off early on saturday after anti-police and minimum - wage - hike protesters shouted down a 100 - year - old @entity7 veteran 's medal ceremony , shouting ' hands up , do n't shoot ' and ' i ca n't breathe , ' more than 100 mostly @entity10 activists jousted verbally with hecklers from the audience who were assembled for a dialog with @entity15 sen. @entity14 – and to honor @entity16			1
when the ensuing chaos reached a fever pitch , the centenarian @entity16 took the microphone to scold the protesters			1
' give me a chance , ' the soft - spoken vet said			0
' let 's show a little respect for this occasion			2
and you people who are here for a cause , whatever it might be – show respect to @entity52 , ' he urged , bringing an eruption of applause from the audience			1
but the boisterous chants grew so loud – including shouts for a $ 15 minimum wage and the end of @entity61 military intervention in the @entity62 – that the meeting was disbanded 45 minutes after it was scheduled to begin			1
@entity16 's medal presentation was the only part of the day 's agenda that actually happened			2
the senator awarded him the @entity61 @entity69 , the @entity70 , the @entity71 , the @entity72 , the @entity73 , the " @entity75 " award and the @entity7 honorable discharge pin			2
he also received a flag that was flown over the @entity78 in @entity79 @entity14 never got a chance to conduct his planned question - and - answer session with the public			2
not amused : the audience sat and watched the drama unfold but never got to ask the senator any questions after the meeting was hijacked but the liberal stalwart seemed unperturbed , telling @entity89 that ' the symbolism of having a veteran , 100 years old , who fought so gallantly so that those who disagree with government policies and want to exercise their first amendment rights could be heard – that 's what made today so poignant			0
' @entity14 is a far - left politician who has leveraged organized protesters in the past to help him pass legislation			0
following the downfall of the ' @entity102 ' in 2012 , @entity14 cited ' massive protests ' and a ' grassroots victory for the history books ' as the main reason for his success in blocking the bill			0
activists in every @entity61 state have shouted ' hands up , do n't shoot ' during demonstrations opposing the fatal shooting of black 18 - year - old @entity113 by a white police officer in @entity115 , @entity116 in august			2
' i ca n't breathe , ' another rallying cry , ' were the last words uttered by @entity120 , an unarmed black man who died in july at the hands of a @entity123 police officer trying to subdue him			0
campus public safety officers attempted to keep some of the protesters outside the building at @entity127 , drawing threats from one of them			0
' i 'll bust your jaw , old man ! ' he shouted in an exchange caught on video			1
befuddled : an annoyed sen. @entity14 stood and watched as his event disintegrated at the hands of protesters whose politics he shares ' @entity140 ! ' this protest leader organized her followers with chants drawn from the infamous ' @entity145 ' encampments another argued with security , who asked if there was ' a possible way that we could get on with the meeting			1
' ' no , ' she said			0
' we 're taking over the town hall			1
this is our town hall now			1
... it belongs to the black people			1
' on saturday , two protesters never made it to the event			0
@entity162 , 36 , and @entity163 , 51 , were cuffed and booked after they refused to obey police commands to stop blocking traffic while protesting outside			0
they were charged with second - degree disorderly conduct			0
@entity14 , @entity0 's senior senator , has said he wants to hold a town hall meeting in every one of @entity0 's 36 counties – this year , and every year			1
@entity171 reports that he has convened more than 700 such meetings so far .			0

activists shouted down @entity7 veteran @entity16 in his moment of honor at event hosted by @entity0 @entity15 sen. @entity14
crowd applauded when @entity16 scolded them to ' show a little respect ' but the rest of the event was *canceled* after 45 minutes of chaos
one protester was caught on video threatening a security guard : ' i 'll break your jaw , old man ! '
@entity14 told group they could speak ' early on ' in the meeting but leader *decided* to ' take over the town hall right now '
she *insisted* that the meeting ' belongs to the black people '
