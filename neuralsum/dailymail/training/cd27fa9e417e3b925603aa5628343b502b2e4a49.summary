in a collection of more than 400 photos offering a rare glimpse behind the scenes of the @entity8 , men and women dart , dive and crash through the @entity14 seas			1
the remarkable pictures follow the volunteers around the clock - from storm - ridden night rescues to their mid-morning cup of tea			2
accompanied by a foreward from @entity22 , the images , captured by crew member and professional photographer @entity24 , have been hailed as a unique snapshot of a long - standing institution			1
powerful : @entity30 's first @entity29 class lifeboat , the @entity31 has been braving the waters off the south - east coast of @entity30 since 2010 battling the @entity14 seas : volunteers for the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) have been captured working around the clock in harsh conditions for a new book veteran : @entity40 is the @entity41 at @entity42 , the oldest @entity8 station in @entity30			1
@entity24 spent two years charting the work of some of the longest - serving volunteers makeover : @entity49 's new all - weather ' tamar class ' lifeboat , @entity50 , gets its first coat of paint in @entity8 colours			1
in the early years of the @entity8 lifeboat hulls were painted in pale blue , later changed to the dark @entity56 seen on today 's lifeboats			1
they are a far cry from oar boats used before the 1890 steam ship came in calm : @entity64 lifeboat @entity62 motors off in unusually kind conditions			2
the waters here are known to be difficult , with severe winters and fierce running tides dramatic scenes at the annual @entity72 race on the @entity73 are documented in the collection , which will soon be touring the nation			2
fighting gale - force winds , a team from @entity77 grapple to board a yacht			2
another image shows volunteers at @entity82 in @entity83 setting off in the dead of night to evacuate a passenger from the cruise ship @entity87			0
lifeguards are snapped on an early morning training session on @entity91 beach in @entity92 before reporting for duty			0
and one of the @entity76 's top boats , @entity96 , is shown launching off the slipway			0
the characters of the @entity8 have also been captured , including @entity40 , the coxswain at @entity30 's oldest station , @entity42 , and @entity101 , who has been fundraising for the organisation for 10 years			1
@entity105 's @entity104 class lifeboat @entity106			2
the £ 1.8m boat was a gift to the @entity8 in 2003 from @entity109 , the father of a former worker ready for next time : the @entity115 lifeboat is called to sea , the crew 's all - weather gear is stowed in the boathouse			1
they are nothing like the 19th century cork jackets tough : the lifeguards face conditions of all kinds			0
these workers are up early for a morning 's training session on @entity91 beach before going on duty for the day putting training into action : hours later , at @entity130 in @entity131 , the lifeboat and lifeguards from across the region come together to provide safety cover for the annual @entity137 triathlon event			2
under their watchful eyes , more than 1,300 athletes undertook a 2.4 mile swim , before setting of on a 112 - mile cycle and a full marathon the view from the wheelhouse of the @entity146 lifeboat , lady of @entity148 , as the crew search for a casualty in the water near the @entity153 wind farm the @entity8 , a charity that saves lives at sea , was set up in 1824 as the @entity156 for the @entity157			1
in 1838 , @entity158 , 22 , became a celebrity of the day by rowing one of the organisation 's boats out to sea single - handedly to save a crew wrecked on the @entity164			2
in 1854 the name was changed and volunteers were given lifejackets made of cork			0
during the @entity170 , they moved from sail and oar power to petrol - run boats			2
the change coincided with women joining the force			0
mr @entity24 , who has worked for the @entity8 for seven years , said he hopes the images will give people a better understanding of their work			1

i ’m on call 24 hours a day			0
i see people in the very worst situations , and i also see the best in people			0
' when a yacht capsized and 21 crew had to be rescued from the sea off the coast of @entity199 in @entity30 , we battled for hours to get everyone safely on the lifeboat			2
as we sailed back , there was a huge crowd waiting			0
' the villagers had bought dry clothes and found houses at a holiday park for the survivors to stay in			0
it was wonderful to see			0
’ mr @entity24 added : ' my favourite photo is a casualty 's eye view			0
i 've been a man overboard on exercises - once in the water , you see nothing , then just a tiny bit of orange , and it 's not the sun , it 's a lifeboat			1
it epitomises the work i do and the work of the @entity8			1
' i hope the exhibition will raise awareness of the charity			0
people who do n't know anything about rescue at sea will get to hear about it , they will know we 're here to help			0
' someone might be inspired to volunteer - not necessarily on the crew , but maybe as fundraiser			0
or some might wish to donate			0
' the @entity239 's all - weather ' tamar class ' lifeboat , @entity96 , launches off the slipway			1

dr @entity251 , historian and author of the book , the lifeboat : courage on our coasts , said : ' it 's a show of great photos that represent the best of the @entity8			1
it 's a way of reminding people they are only ever 70 miles from the sea - we may all need the @entity8 's help			1
' we 've joined crews all around the country on shouts , but also for a cup of tea			0
the photos are a collection of what the @entity8 family means , the true spirit of the @entity8 - ordinary people doing extraordinary things			1
' the @entity8 operates 237 lifeboat stations in the @entity183 and @entity30 and has 200 lifeguard units on beaches around the @entity183			1
