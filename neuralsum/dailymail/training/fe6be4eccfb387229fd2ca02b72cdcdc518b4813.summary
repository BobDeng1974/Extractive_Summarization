by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 14 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:39 est , 14 february 2014 @entity4 leader @entity3 defended himself against allegations of sexism @entity3 today insisted that ‘ no one has done more ’ than him to promote women as he tried to shake off claims his party was sexist			1
the @entity4 leader said women were ‘ slowly but surely taking over ’ his party – and that after the @entity15 elections there will be as many high - profile @entity4 women as men			1
he said this had been achieved despite the party not engaging in positive discrimination ; a policy which he described as ‘ demeaning ’			2
mr @entity3 also said the country needed an ‘ honest debate ’ about our maternity laws which he said were placing a huge burden on small businesses			0
he was interviewed on @entity29 ’s @entity30 a day after @entity4 came second in the @entity31 by election – pushing the conservatives into third place			1
critics say the party has an image problem with women because of comments by senior figures such as @entity41 , who described women as ‘ sluts ’ last autumn			1
in addition , most of the party ’s top team are male , but mr @entity3 insisted that was changing			2
‘ @entity4 in the early days was very male dominated , and also amongst the voters far more men voted for us than women , ’ he said			1
‘ we saw a change in that begin to happen last year			0
i think the reason for that was the three big by - election advances that we made – @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 – all female candidates			0
‘ we ’ve just completed our selections for the @entity15 elections and the women have done amazingly well			2
in fact there are some saying that women are about to take @entity4 over			1
‘ from may 22 this year , post the @entity15 elections , there are going to be , among our top line people , as many women as men – and that ’s not happened with positive discrimination , it ’s happened because our members have judged they are the right people			2
’ he praised @entity76 its belief in meritocracy on gender and class ; contrasting it with @entity82 and the @entity83 ’ belief in positive discrimination			0
‘ there ’s a huge debate in politics , ’ he said			0
‘ is positive discrimination the way forward ? or do we just say : we do n’t care whether people are black or white , male or female – we let them get on according to their ability			0
that ’s the view that we ’ve taken in @entity4			1
‘ that is going to be at forefront of the national debate for years to come , because we have @entity15 rules on the percentage of women that have to be in the boardroom			2
‘ so we ’re moving down the road of positive discrimination to create a fairer society and i ’m not sure it works			0
’ @entity105 , pictured meeting locals on the flooded @entity107 , warned that positive discrimination towards women is ' demeaning ' pointing out that @entity4 women often appear on @entity115 , he added : ‘ the women are slowly but surely taking over @entity4 , they ’re going to dominate the election coverage			1
we believe in a meritocracy , we think that positive discrimination is demeaning			0
’ mr @entity3 was asked about comments by former @entity4 member @entity118 that : ‘ @entity3 does not like women … he thinks women should be in the kitchen or in the bedroom			1
’ he replied : ‘ nobody but nobody has taken that seriously because they all know it ’s not true			0
nobody has done more to promote women in @entity4 than i ’ve done , not through positive discrimination			1
‘ when people get kicked out of political parties they tend to be very bitter and very upset and say all sorts of things			0
but she got it wrong and that ’s why it ’s never stuck			0
’ the @entity137 said : ‘ when you get the results from the @entity15 elections , you ’ll be astonished to see as many women as men in the top slots in @entity4 – things have changed			1
’ @entity4 has been campaigning this week for @entity146 ’s foreign aid budget to be diverted towards flood relief in southern @entity148			1
mr @entity3 told @entity30 that the policy is playing better with women than men , ‘ because i think that women actually do tend to be people that think very much about the family , and about budgets – men tend to be rather more irresponsible on these issues in many households			1
’ he defended his comments that women who have children are ‘ worth less ’ to their @entity165 employers , saying he was only talking about the financial sector			1
‘ if a woman is a doctor , a dentist , a lawyer , then having time off to have children makes absolutely no difference to her career advancement at all , ’ he said			1
@entity4 has been dogged by allegations of sexism since former @entity41 , who later quit , described a roomful of female supporters as ' sluts ' but he said maternity laws put too much burden on small businesses			2
‘ that is something we ’ve got to talk about and debate honestly , ’ he said			0
‘ on the one hand we want women to have every opportunity to go into the workplace , but on the other we have to allow our small businesses to survive			0
’ mr @entity3 also defended former @entity4 member @entity41 , who said an employer would have to have their ‘ head examined ’ if they wanted to employ a woman of childbearing age			2
he said that the likes of @entity192 and @entity193 agreed with the comments , which were worded badly			0
‘ what he was saying was legislation that was put in place to protect women in the workplace is now in a sense discriminating against them getting a job in the first place , ’ he said			0
‘ a lot of people now agree that the essence of what he said was right , but the way he expressed it perhaps upset people			0

@entity4 leader claims women are ' slowly but surely taking over ' party
says women back cutting aid budget because they ' think about budgets '
defends claim that women who take time off for children are ' worth less '
