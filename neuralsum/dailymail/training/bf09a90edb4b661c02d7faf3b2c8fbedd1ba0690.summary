by @entity0 last week i told you about my trip to @entity4 for @entity5 - a giant international trade show for the professional beauty and cosmetics industry , with hundreds of exhibitors from all corners of the beauty world			1
i was there with my nail polish range @entity14 , but of course i took the opportunity to explore the huge arena and discover new and exciting beauty treatments and products			2
they 're based in @entity32 and run make - up schools throughout @entity29 and worldwide			1
as well as this , they have a professional quality make - up line popular with make - up artists and beauty junkies like myself			2
when i was offered the chance to get a @entity23 makeover , i obviously could n't refuse ! the make - up artist chose to recreate a @entity32 - style look on me that was natural yet super-glam			1
here 's how she did itâ € ¦ my makeover with @entity23 @entity46 @entity0 said she adored the vibrant coral shade of her lips the lovely @entity23 make - up artist started off by applying @entity23 's @entity51 across my face to provide a smooth base for the rest of my make - up			1
then , she applied their @entity56 to my skin using a small foundation brush			2
the product evened out my skin tone beautifully while providing a gorgeous sheer finish			0
a great tip she told me was to test the colour of the foundation out on the neck , as opposed to the face , to ensure a perfect match			0
step 2 - concealer next , she took a blue shade of their corrector ( cream concealer ) and applied it gently to my eyelids as well as under my eyes			0
the blue tones work to neutralise any redness in those regions , evening out the skintone effectively			0
step 3 - highlight and @entity83 of course , no @entity32 style makeover would be complete without some serious sculpting ! using a small face brush , she applied @entity23 's @entity88 on my chin , under my eyebrows and across my cheekbones to give me a subtle glow			1
she then took a darker shade of their @entity56 to contour the hollows of my cheeks , as well as gently sweeping it across the top of my forehead near the hairline and across my jawline for added definition			0
@entity103 to set my base , the make - up artist used various shades of @entity23 's @entity103 to give the skin a three - dimensional , radiant look			1
using a fan brush , she first applied a very light shade in the area under my eyes , using only a very small amount so as not to counteract the glowy look of the base			0
she then dusted a light layer of powder in my skintone all over the face , and finished by emphasising the contour on my cheekbones with a darker shade of the powder			0
using different shades of finishing powder on the face was n't a trick i 'd tried before , but it worked wonders in giving my skin a flawless finish			2
@entity0 says that testing a foundation shade on your neck rather than your face can help find a better colour match for your skin tone step 5 - eyes she then pencilled in my eyebrows with a dark brown shade of @entity23 's @entity142 , gently blending in the colour using a small brush			1
for my lids , she selected a gorgeous coppery shade of their @entity142 shadow called @entity149 gold , and applied it all over the lid , blending well			0
she packed the colour onto the outer corners of my eyes - on both the upper and lower lash lines - to create a smouldering , smokey effect			0
after this , she defined my eyes using @entity23 's @entity158 in a soft brown shade , applied with a damp brush			1
applying brown eyeliner close to the lash line helps make lashes look fuller , so she took her time to ensure she had filled every crevice between my lashes with the liner			0
finally she applied a touch of @entity23 's @entity169 to give my eyelashes a flirty flutter			1
step 6 - lips for my lips , the make - up artist used a vibrant coral shade of @entity23 's @entity176 called @entity177 , applying it carefully with a small lip brush			2
i absolutely adored the result , and certainly learnt some great make - up tips ! all the @entity23 products the make - up artist are available online at @entity184 , but i 've found some great alternatives you can buy here in the @entity188 that will allow you to create a similar look @entity0 suggests using these products that can be found in the @entity188 to achieve her @entity23 makeover look @entity192 @entity193 @entity194 @entity195 @entity196 glam'eyes @entity197 in @entity198 @entity199 in @entity200 @entity202 @entity201 @entity203 in @entity204 hope you all had a lovely choc - filled @entity206 ! love @entity208 xxx			1
