by @entity0 published : 18:23 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 21 june 2013 at least 1,000 gagging orders have been signed by government departments and the @entity4 since the general election , costing taxpayers a ‘ staggering ’ £ 28million			2
an official report has uncovered at least 1,053 examples – one a day over the past three years – of the public sector paying off staff and buying their silence by getting them to sign confidentiality clauses			2
the highest payment of £ 266,000 , which was described as ‘ obscene ’ , was made by the @entity16			1
the department accounted for more than a third of the ‘ compromise agreements ’ exposed by the @entity20			1
the highest payment of £ 266,000 , which was described as ' obscene ' , was made by the @entity16			1
the department accounted for more than a third of the ' compromise agreements ' exposed by the @entity20 there are claims that the agreements have been used to prevent @entity27 executives speaking out about poor care in hospitals			1
the spending watchdog found that across government there were 44 payments of £ 100,000 or more , and 110 of between £ 50,000 and £ 100,000			2
three other departments , @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36 , bought people ’s silence with more than £ 200,000			1
the highest average payment – more than £ 76,000 – was at the @entity40			1
no fewer than 98 per cent of the compromise agreements uncovered included confidentiality clauses , and even though the law is meant to protect whistleblowers , many recipients told the @entity20 they felt they had been gagged			1
the real number of compromise agreements will be far higher because not all are recorded by the @entity49			1
they do not include the millions handed out by councils and the @entity52			0
the report by the @entity20 condemned the lack of ‘ transparency , consistency and accountability ’ around the agreements			2
the findings were condemned by @entity60 , chairman of the powerful commons public accounts committee			0
three other departments , @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36 ( above ) , bought people 's silence with more than £ 200,000 ‘ it is staggering that no one has any idea how many compromise agreements are used and whether , overall , they are value for money , ’ she said			1
‘ pulling disparate bits of information together reveals a worrying picture			0
‘ it is illegal for a compromise agreement to be used to stop people from whistleblowing			0
but this is not made clear enough and some people who have signed these agreements say they feel like they had been gagged			2
‘ it is simply unacceptable for people who speak up about failures in service delivery to feel like they have been silenced in this way			0
‘ there are individual cases where obscene amounts have been approved ; as much as £ 266,000 in the @entity16 and £ 120,000 in the @entity86			1
‘ the centre of government must take control and assure itself that the use of these agreements is not squandering taxpayers ’ money or covering up government failures			0
the current state of affairs can not continue			0
’ the report found that the @entity49 had approved £ 11.2million in severance payments by the @entity16 in the three years to march			2
one @entity99 pay - off was £ 250,000 , while the top figures at the @entity36 and @entity101 were £ 225,000			0
the level of payments across most departments has been rising in recent years			0
the law states that compromise agreements are not allowed to prevent whistleblowing , and the @entity20 said that none did			1
but the report said : ‘ some people we spoke to who had been offered , or accepted , compromise agreements have felt gagged			1
‘ an organisation ’s culture , the events leading up to the person being offered an agreement , and the wording of the agreements contributed to whether the individual felt gagged			0
‘ legal advice to the employee is a prerequisite of making a compromise agreement legally enforceable			0
however , the individuals we spoke to felt that it was not generally made clear that confidentiality clauses do not prevent employees from raising legitimate public interest concerns			0
’ the @entity20 also criticised the way the pay - offs were often used to get rid of poorly performing members of staff			2
these workers were given good references , meaning they could get jobs elsewhere in the public sector .			0
