by @entity0 last updated at 1:50 am on 5th january 2012 having twin babies can often be a handful – unless , as with @entity3 and his sister @entity4 , they arrive five years apart			1
the siblings were born from the same batch of embryos created during their parents ’ ivf treatment			2
but while @entity3 was successfully implanted in 2006 , seven - week - old @entity4 was kept on ice until last year			1
delight : @entity12 and @entity13 , who underwent fertility treatment , with their two children you took your time ! @entity3 , five , with his twin sister @entity4 ( seven weeks )			1
they were conceived from the same batch of embryos now their parents , @entity13 and @entity12 , delight in telling well - wishers all about the incredible age gap between their ‘ twins ’			2
‘ i tell everybody i can , ’ said mr @entity3 , a business lecturer			1
‘ people take an interest in a newborn baby and with @entity3 around as well , i find it very difficult to resist the temptation to say “ oh and by the way , they are twins ”			1
‘ it ’s almost just to see people ’s response			0
they are really amazed and surprised			0
’ his wife , a charity worker , added : ‘ it does feel quite surreal			0
‘ i think people are really , really surprised and it almost takes them a few minutes to get their heads around it			0
‘ we obviously had nine months to get it straight and to think “ gosh , we ’re having @entity3 ’s twin ” , but it ’s incredibly special			1
’ @entity3 tells friends his sister was ' kept in a freezer ' mrs @entity50 , 38 , and her 45 - year - old husband began fertility treatment in 2005			1
during the medical process , five embryos were created and two implanted in mrs @entity50 , which resulted in the birth of @entity3 on december 9 , 2006			1
the remaining three embryos were frozen until the couple , from @entity60 , @entity61 , decided to try for another child in march last year			0
only one of the embryos survived the defrosting process and 39 weeks later @entity4 arrived by caesarean section			1
@entity3 is fascinated by his little sister			1
‘ he knows that she ’s been in the freezer , ’ said mrs @entity50			0
‘ he likes to say she has been in the freezer with the chips and the chicken , so he is sort of aware that she is his twin , but obviously he does n’t really understand how it ’s all worked			0
‘ they do look very similar			0
@entity3 was just a bigger version of @entity4 when he was born , so certainly there are similarities physically			1
’ recalling their decision to try for a second child , mr @entity3 said : ‘ we wanted to complete the family			2
we were aware the odds were long			0
‘ you just ca n’t comprehend that a life could come from some material that ’s been frozen for that length of time			2
’ doctors who treated the @entity90 at the @entity91 said the decision to freeze remaining ivf embryos was a safer way to have more than one child			0
lead clinician dr @entity96 said : ‘ we very often recommend storing surplus embryos so that they can be used at a later date			0
‘ sadly , due to the chance work of nature , not everybody is able to have those surplus embryos and , of course , not everybody meets with success when they are used			0
’ happy family : @entity12 and @entity13 with their twins @entity108 and @entity4			2

@entity3 and @entity4 were conceived at the same time but born five years apart
