by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:13 pm on 12th october 2011 @entity2 began to free prominent dissidents today at the start of a general amnesty for more than six thousand prisoners			1
it was not clear how many of the country 's estimated 2,000 political detainees were included in the amnesty - one estimate said 155 of them were freed			1
but the released included ailing @entity13 commander @entity12 and comedian @entity14 , who was imprisoned after criticising the government 's response to @entity17 in 2008			1
@entity18 : women walk free from @entity20 near @entity21 after president @entity22 issued an amnesty for 6,359 prisoners yesterday @entity14 said after his release : ' i will be happy and i will thank the government only when all of my friends are freed			1
' those still held include student leaders from the failed 1988 democracy uprising in @entity2 , also known as @entity2			0
@entity36 governments , the @entity33 and @entity2 's opposition have eagerly awaited a broad political amnesty as a gesture of liberalisation by the elected government after decades of harsh military rule			2
free at last : comedian and political prisoner @entity42 , who was freed from @entity45 prison in northern @entity2 , at @entity46 after his release today jubilant : released prisoners make their way through the crowd as they leave @entity20 near @entity21 a failure to follow through could hamper the country 's efforts to improve its human rights record and have @entity36 economic and political sanctions lifted			1
relatives and freed prisoners held emotional reunions with loved ones around the country a day after the new civilian president declared an amnesty for 6,359 inmates - many of them ordinary criminals - on humanitarian grounds , but without disclosing any names			1
joyful : @entity70 speaks to the families of political prisoners in @entity21 as 155 dissidents are released			1
right , a freed prisoner embraces his weeping mother outside @entity20 prison pro-democracy campaigner and @entity78 laureate @entity70 , herself released from 15 years of house arrest last november , said : ' the freedom of each individual is invaluable , but i wish that all political prisoners would be released			1
' @entity70 's @entity85 confirmed the release of 155 political detainees , including members of her party , spokesman @entity84 said			1
but other dissidents could have been freed from remote prisons without having contacted anyone yet			2
president @entity22 , a retired senior army officer who took office in march , has launched a series of economic reforms and eased limits on freedom of speech by relaxing censorship and unblocking banned websites			0
he also has started a dialogue with @entity70 , made calls for peace with @entity105 ethnic minority rebel groups and suspended a controversial @entity107 - backed hydropower dam project after a public outcry			1
@entity109 called the prisoner release a ' minimum first step '			0
@entity12 , the released @entity13 commander , was serving a 106 - year prison sentence for high treason following his arrest in 2005			2
the @entity105 are a repressed minority within @entity2 who have been enganged in conflict with the @entity2 government for decades			1
it was initially thought that @entity119 , a young charismatic @entity120 monk who was among the leaders of the september 2007 anti-government uprising , had been freed but it transpired that he was still in prison			2
walk to freedom : women clutching their possessions leave the gates of @entity20 , many were held for years without hope of release family joy : relatives of prisoners wait outside @entity20 following the announcement that inmates were set to be released @entity139 secretary of state @entity138 , speaking to @entity137 , said she was encouraged by ' promising signals ' of political reform but it was too early to announce any steps @entity144 might take in response			1
the @entity139 , @entity146 and @entity147 have said freeing an estimated 2,100 political prisoners in @entity2 is essential to even considering lifting sanctions that have crippled the pariah state and , over years , driven it closer to @entity107			1
free at last : prisoners take their first steps of freedom today from the men 's jail at @entity20 near @entity21 relief : prisoners show their emotion as they are let out from the gated prison day they never thought would come : men are marched out of @entity20 , just 24 hours after the announcement that more than 6,000 prisoners would be given amnesty mrs @entity138 said : ' we 're encouraged by the steps we see the government taking ... we 're going to take them at their word			2
' but we want to see actions			0
and if they are going to release political prisoners that would be a very positive sign			1
' previous general amnesties have included only a token number of political prisoners but there was optimism this time as the @entity2 government seeks to distance itself from @entity107 and makes overtures to the @entity36			1
the army nominally handed over power in march to civilians after elections in november , a process ridiculed at the time as a sham to cement authoritarian rule behind a democratic facade			0
nevertheless , president @entity22 , the first civilian head of state in half a century , has initiated overtures including calls to win over ethnic minorities			0
the new national human rights commission called on the president in an open letter published in state media on tuesday to free prisoners who did not pose ' a threat to the stability of state and public tranquillity '			2
@entity14 , 49 , was imprisoned after speaking out against the official response to cyclone @entity17 in 2008 , which left more than 140,000 people dead			1
he is celebrated for his films , plays and poetry and even dubbed the comedy @entity207			0
but even though he was imprisoned 900 miles away from his family in @entity45 prison in @entity21 in 2010 a brief poem penned by him was passed to a friend			0
it read : ' it 's lucky my forehead is flat / since my arm must often rest there / beneath it shines a light i must invite / from a moon i can not see / in @entity45			0
' this was the forth time the comedian had been imprisoned he had always insisted humour would prevail : ' @entity2 people love to laugh			2
if i ca n’t speak , jokes will still spread			0
people will make them up themselves			0
' the open letter marks a significant shift in the former @entity233 colony where authorities have long refused to recognise the existence of political prisoners , usually dismissing such detainees as common criminals			1
the government has faced pressure for change on multiple fronts , from the need to find alternatives to @entity107 in the face of popular resentment of its influence , to growing frustration in @entity249 over @entity2 's isolation as the region approaches an @entity254 - style @entity253 community in 2015			0
diplomats say other factors play into its desire to open up , include a need for technical assistance from the @entity261 and other multilateral institutions which cut off ties years ago in response to abuses of human rights			0
nestled strategically between the powerhouses of @entity268 and @entity107 , @entity2 has been one of the world 's most difficult destinations for investors , restricted by sanctions , blighted by half a century of oppressive military rule and starved of capital despite rich natural resources , from gems to timber to oil			0
the country 's infrastructure is in shambles and its economy has few sources of growth beyond investment from @entity107 and @entity287			0
about 30 per cent of its 50 million people live in poverty , according to @entity33 data			0
some analysts say @entity2 also wants to show the @entity139 that it is independent of @entity107			0
last week , the government suspended a £ 2.3billion @entity107 - led dam project , a victory for supporters of @entity70 and a sign the country was willing to yield to popular resentment over @entity107 's growing influence			2
these moves have fuelled hopes the new parliament will slowly open the country that just over 50 years ago was one of @entity249 's wealthiest as the world 's biggest rice exporter and a major energy producer			0
in @entity312 , a foreign ministry official said @entity313 had resumed some aid to @entity2 in june after the release of @entity70 and other signs of reform			2
' we may continue with this stance if there are more releases of political prisoners , ' the official said			1
' @entity323 still needs to be done in terms of democracy but we think they are moving in the right direction			0

155 political prisoners freed , says @entity70
