@entity0 has captured a selfie of its shadow on comet @entity3 in what is the highest - resolution image to be taken by the probe			1
the image was taken during a @entity8 flyby when @entity0 passed within just four miles ( 6 km ) from the surface of the icy comet			1
the image was taken during a @entity8 flyby when the @entity0 passed just four miles ( 6 km ) from the surface of the icy comet			1
the glow causes the shadow to be fuzzy and somewhat larger than @entity0 itself , measuring approximately 65ft by 165 ft ( 20 by 50 metres )			2
if the sun were farther away , the shadow would be sharp and almost exactly the same size as @entity0 , which is around 2 x 32 metres			1
however , even at 215 million miles ( 347 million km ) from @entity35 on 14 february , the sun appeared as a disc about 0.2 degrees across			2
this is about 2.3 times smaller than on @entity38 - resulting in a fuzzy ' penumbra ' around the spacecraft 's shadow			1
with @entity0 just four miles ( 6km ) above the surface , the penumbra effect adds roughly 65ft ( 20 metres ) to the spacecraft 's dimensions , which this graphic shows the difference between how a sharp shadow is generated by a point source ( left ) and a fuzzy shadow by a diffuse source ( right ) the view , which shows the detail in features down to 11cm , is of a region on the bottom of the comet			1
the @entity59 narrow - angle camera image from the close flyby shown here in context with a @entity64 image if you were standing on the surface with @entity0 high above you , there would be no place in the shadow where the entire sun would be blocked from view			1
the view , which shows the detail in features down to 11cm , is of a region on the bottom of the comet			0
other images reveal boulders on the comet 's surface , as well as ' stunning details of the contrasting terrain , ' the @entity76 said			1
the boulders in these images range in size from a few metres to a few tens of metres , and lay scattered across the comet 's surface			1
images taken from this viewpoint are of high scientific value , ' says @entity59 principal investigator @entity91 from the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) in @entity93			0
' this kind of view is key for the study of grain sizes			0
' @entity76 's @entity0 spacecraft launched on 2 march 2004 aboard an ariane 5 rocket , on a mission to visit comet @entity101			1
it took more than ten years to reach the comet , and on the way it flew past @entity106 and two asteroids			0
on 6 august 2014 it entered orbit around the comet , beginning a series of complex manoeuvres to get the best views possible			0
on 12 november 2014 @entity0 successfully released a smaller vehicle it had carried called @entity114			2
this small probe bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest			0
although @entity114 's landing did not go as planned , it was still able to complete more than 90 per cent of the science it was intended to do before its main batteries died , sending the probe to sleep			0
the location of the lander is currently unknown			0
it is thought to be in partial shadow near a cliff but , as the comet approaches the sun , the additional light may charge its solar panels enough for the lander to wake up			2
@entity0 , meanwhile , is continuing its mission around the comet			1
@entity133 is approaching the sun and , by august this year , it is thought its activity will have dramatically increased			0
this will release much more ice , vapour and other materials from the surface - and @entity0 will be there to watch it all happen			2
this @entity59 shape model is marked with the position of the narrow - angle camera field of view taken during the 14 february flyby a four - image montage of @entity147 – @entity148 comprising images taken on 14 february 2015 during the first dedicated close flyby			1
this image set was taken at 10:32 gmt from a distance of 7.8 miles ( 12.6 km ) from the comet centre			2
using the surface distance , the image scale is 0.9 m / pixel the closest approach took place at 12:41 gmt over the @entity160 region on the comet 's large lobe			2
@entity0 's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet 's small lobe at the top of the image , with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set			1
as well as providing the opportunity to take close - up high - resolution images of the comet surface , flybys like this also allow @entity0 's instruments to sample the innermost parts of the comet 's atmosphere , or coma			1
@entity0 is now moving out for a far view of the comet – it will reach a distance of about 160 miles ( 255km ) from the comet centre tomorrow			1
last month , @entity186 said the structure of @entity188 resembles ice cream			0
in an experiment , they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard , outer crust , the interior would mostly be fluffy ice			0
@entity0 's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet 's small lobe at the top of the image , with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set ' a comet is like deep fried ice cream , ' said dr @entity202 of @entity186 's @entity203 in @entity204 , @entity205 , corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the @entity208			1
' the crust is made of crystalline ice , while the interior is colder and more porous			0
the organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top			0
' to come to the conclusion , astronomers used an icebox - like instrument nicknamed @entity219			0
they showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up			0
the composition of comets is important to understanding how they might have delivered water and organics to the young , hot @entity38			0
new results from the @entity0 mission show that asteroids may have been the primary carriers of life 's ingredients ; however , the debate is ongoing and comets may have played a role			2

the halo is believed to be created by a trick of light from the sun
sun over comet appears 2.3 smaller than on @entity38 , causing the effect
@entity256 's *day* *swoop* was the first dedicated close flyby of the mission
@entity0 passed just four miles ( 6 km ) from the surface of the icy comet
imaged boulders range in size from a few metres to a few tens of metres
