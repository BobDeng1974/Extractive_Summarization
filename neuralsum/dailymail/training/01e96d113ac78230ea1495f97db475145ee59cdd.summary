by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:23 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:23 est , 30 december 2013 young sufferer : @entity4 , 32 , thought she had trapped nerve , but found out she has ms stretching her arms above her head in the gym , @entity4 felt a shock run from her neck to the base of her spine			1
‘ it lasted two seconds and it was like someone walking over your grave — but with a spark running through it , ’ says @entity4 , who was then 28 and in training for a rowing race			1
‘ i was working my arm muscles hard , so i blamed that			2
’ over the next month , the sensation recurred every few days			2
looking up the symptoms online , she diagnosed a trapped nerve in her neck			1
six weeks later she went to her gp			2
@entity4 , who was an investment banker , was given tests to check her balance and grip — these proved normal			1
‘ the doctor agreed that it was a trapped nerve			2
’ but this was not a harmless sports injury			2
in fact , @entity4 — now 32 , who lives in @entity35 , @entity36 , with her husband @entity37 , 33 , a banker — was experiencing the beginnings of multiple sclerosis			1
this debilitating neurological condition , which affects around 100,000 people in @entity43 , happens when the immune system attacks healthy nerve fibres running between the brain and spinal cord			1
the nerves become inflamed , leading to muscle spasm , blurred eyesight or loss of vision , dizziness , numbness and tingling limbs			2
there is no cure , and it can cause varying degrees of disability , and eventually in some cases , paralysis			2
there is no clear cause for @entity6 but one theory is that it is linked to a lack of vitamin d , obtained from the skin ’s exposure to sunlight			2
the condition is more common in the @entity73 , and as dr @entity74 , a consultant neurologist at @entity75 and @entity76 , explains : ‘ the further away you are from the equator , the more likely you are to develop @entity71 ’ doctors also do not understand why @entity6 affects three times more females than males — and the ratio is widening , says dr @entity82 , an @entity6 specialist and consultant at the @entity84 , @entity85			1
@entity6 is also on the increase worldwide			2
again , it ’s not clear why , although dr @entity82 says : ‘ some wonder about the impact of the modern lifestyle and diet			2
but @entity6 does n’t discriminate ; anybody can get it			2
‘ there are possible links to environmental factors such as viruses or bacteria — although no single infection has been identified as a trigger			2
’ big change : heavily pregnant @entity4 , pictured with son @entity102 , has had to leave her job as an investment banker as a result of her debilitating condition the condition mainly affects the young , with up to 75 per cent of cases being diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40			1
@entity4 ’s case highlights the difficulties in spotting @entity71 ‘ my gp thought it was nothing to worry about , but referred me to a neurologist to make sure , ’ she says			1
‘ when i saw my gp again after my diagnosis a couple of months later , she was shocked and upset			2
’ dr @entity82 says : ‘ i have great sympathy with gps because a lot of people might have pins and needles or tingling , which can be due to any number of processes — such as a trapped nerve or vitamin deficiencies			1
’ the time taken for diagnosis varies because there is no single test for the condition			2
when @entity4 saw the neurologist in july 2009 , he diagnosed @entity136 ’s sign — a nerve pain which causes electrical sensations down the back			1
‘ he told me it generally signifies a brain tumour or @entity6 , but i thought : “ no , that ’s not me			0
i ’m not sick ” , ’ she says			0
indeed , that weekend , @entity4 ran a 10k race			1
but the next day she had severe muscle pain in her limbs , hands and feet			0
‘ it was only then i started worrying , and cried			0
’ she had an mri scan and a lumbar puncture			0
two weeks later , she and @entity37 saw the neurologist for the results			0
the scan showed lesions around her spine , a sign of @entity71 dr @entity82 says lesions are like scars : ‘ they are linked to damaged myelin , the substance surrounding nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord			0
@entity156 insulates the nerve fibres and enables them to transmit impulses			0
’ as the neurologist confirmed the @entity6 diagnosis , @entity4 recalls : ‘ i felt my whole world was caving in and i began sobbing			1
@entity37 and i wanted to start a family , but instead i saw myself confined to a wheelchair			0
’ dr @entity74 says : ‘ around 50 per cent of people require a walking aid or wheelchair 15 to 20 years after the first onset of symptoms			1
the inflammation can clear up , and if it does , the nerve fibres can repair themselves			0
‘ there are cases of so - called “ benign ” @entity6 , which stays mild throughout its course			1
but repeated attacks can leave permanent scarring			0
’ @entity4 discovered no two cases of @entity6 are the same : ‘ there was no way of knowing if i ’d be in a wheelchair at 40 , or still running competitively at 50			1
’ dr @entity82 says : ‘ there are two main forms of @entity6 ; relapsing / remitting , and progressive			0
when symptoms get worse quickly this is known as a relapse			1
periods when they improve or disappear are known as remissions			0
’ the soon - to - be mother - of - two is one of around 100,000 people affected by the debilitating neurological condition , where the immune system attacks healthy nerve fibres running between the brain and spinal cord @entity6 is characterised by worsening pain with fewer remissions , and increased likelihood of disability — or eventual paralysis			1
treatment is centred around disease - modifying - drugs ( @entity210 ) , which interfere with the immune system and help prevent some relapses			1
@entity4 says : ‘ i needed a positive attitude			1
after reading about studies in the @entity215 advocating vitamins , supplements and fish oils to combat symptoms , i started taking them , and found my energy levels soared			1
’ she remained well enough to not require drugs , which meant she and @entity37 could start a family ; their son @entity102 was born in july 2011			0
her symptoms virtually disappeared during pregnancy			1
however , in the months following @entity102 ’s birth , her symptoms reappeared — with added facial numbness and weakened legs			1
‘ i feared i might not be able to care for @entity102 properly , or have any more children , ’ she says			0
on her neurologist ’s advice , she started injecting a @entity210 called @entity234 three times a week , and soon felt better			0
but a more serious relapse came in november last year			0
‘ i was reading my kindle and i noticed a dark shadow across my left eye			0
i switched the light on , but it made no difference			0
‘ i ’d gone completely blind in my left eye			0
after half an hour my sight returned			0
next morning , i called my @entity6 nurse , and she exp - lained it was optic neuritis			1
’ this is when the optic nerve is inflamed , disrupting messages from the eye to the brain			0
@entity4 began frequently experiencing sporadic sight loss , and this still recurs now when she is overtired			1
‘ this is due to scarring from the original attack , ’ says dr @entity82			0
‘ symptoms are more likely to recur if the patient is tired or stressed			1
’ the setback prompted @entity4 to quit her @entity258 job and focus on a range of vitamins and supplements she has developed specifically for women			1
during another ‘ remission ’ earlier this year , she stopped her medication to try for another baby , and is due to give birth in early january			0
‘ i do have days where i worry , but i shut it out			0
there ’s so much research going on that we have to remain hopeful			0
’ dr @entity74 agrees : ‘ advances are being made all the time , and there are four new therapies set for review by the @entity276 ( @entity276 )			0
our ability to treat @entity6 in the future is potentially very exciting			0
’ @entity4 ’s nutrient range , @entity280 , is available at @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 from march 2014 , innerme.co.uk			1
