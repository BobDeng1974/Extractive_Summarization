for @entity1 , for @entity2			1
@entity1 had n’t scored all season ; they had looked a shadow of a team who should be making light work of the @entity10 group stage by now			1
and then , on the hour , in the @entity12 , a plan came together			0
for @entity1 , a goal at last			1
for @entity2 , a performance that lived up to the hype			2
they were men down here , and good men , too — @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 until midway through the second half			1
@entity26 lost , and a place in monday ’s last - 16 draw was the prize			1
by @entity31 , they made hard work of it — but this , coupled with the magnificent finale against @entity36 , has changed the narrative around @entity38 in this tournament			2

ratings by @entity114 the next stage will be hard : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 are their possible opponents in the second round , but a number of those clubs will be fearing @entity2 every bit as much as @entity2 are nervous around @entity128 ’s big beasts			2
it is feasible , after this , that a corner has been turned			0
city have every right to approach @entity134 with renewed confidence			0
they have taken their time , but this team are at last finding ways to win in the continent ’s most inhospitable places			0
@entity42 have not lost here this season in @entity143 and were expecting to progress from @entity144 , in the slipstream of @entity36			1
they had outplayed @entity2 in the away fixture even if the game ended in a draw			1
@entity2 ’s depleted ranks made it a tall order for a team that has struggled even at full strength			2
yet , as strange as this may seem of a side with such experience , @entity2 came of age here			2
they scored — and that was essential , because @entity42 needed only a 0 - 0 draw if @entity160 lost — and then they held on , despite a fierce onslaught			1
@entity93 claimed the second goal with four minutes left , and even the most nervous traveller could breathe easy after that			2
@entity2 ended the game in rare nick , knocking the ball about like @entity10 aristocracy			1
and what a peach of a goal made that possible			0
@entity1 had not scored since the final day of last season			2
he was precisely the type of player who needed to step up to the plate with @entity19 absent , and most certainly he did			2
credit @entity100 with a fine decoy run which opened the space for the shot , but @entity1 ’s finish was superb			2
a right - foot blast from just outside the area , deviating slightly and striking the inside of goalkeeper @entity72 ’s near post , nestling in the net			0
cue a frantic finish in front of a riotous @entity190 assembly			0
in many ways , this was where @entity2 came into their own			2
true , due to @entity198 ’s methods of separating tied teams at the group stage , after @entity1 ’s intervention @entity42 needed to score twice to progress , but this was @entity2 shorn of their inspirational captain @entity21			1
@entity94 and @entity95 are nothing if not accident - prone			0
yet , under intense pressure , they stood tall			0
city celebrate @entity1 's goal in front of their travelling fans packed into one corner of the stadium in @entity212 @entity93 added a late second for @entity2 as they moved into the last 16 of the @entity10 @entity93 slotted into the bottom corner in the dying moments at the @entity12 to cap a famous night for @entity2 @entity93 jumps into the arms of @entity92 in celebration ( left ) and clenches his fist towards @entity2 's travelling support ( right ) @entity2 manager @entity53 smiles after a job well done for his team at the @entity12 as did @entity92			1
shortly before @entity1 ’s goal , he had made a fine diving save from @entity83 and immediately after he kept out @entity224 in similar fashion			2
his best , though , came from a header by @entity75			0
@entity92 flung himself to the left and somehow , with his fingertips , prised it on to a post			2
@entity94 cleared off the line , too , but it was @entity235 ’s goalkeeper who earned man of the match plaudits in the aftermath			2
@entity53 has not always shown the greatest faith in him , but on occasions like this his quality shines through			0
he is head and shoulders the best goalkeeper in the country			0
city , as @entity235 ’s champions , should be setting standards , but are not			0
in @entity134 this season they have on occasions been an embarrassment			0
the defeat at home by @entity26 was a new low			2
@entity92 and @entity96 celebrate a win for @entity2 that kept their @entity10 campaign alive @entity92 receives a hug from unused substitute @entity107 after @entity2 's victory at the @entity12 @entity92 was man of the match for @entity2 at the @entity12 as he made a number of important saves yet this is a forgiving competition , the group stage offering many second chances , and fair play to @entity2 for taking theirs			1
they should have been long gone			0
they looked it that night against @entity160 , and again as @entity36 danced around them in the previous match			1
yet @entity19 ’s hat - trick surprised us all on that occasion , and a collective effort did the trick here			1
city having been derided as a one - man team , it was perhaps understandable that @entity1 seized on that aspect of the victory in his interviews			1
stronger together , was his message			0
on this evidence it was impossible to deny			0
it definitely helped that @entity2 knew @entity160 were losing at half - time			1
provided that result was maintained , it made the second half a straight shoot - out between the teams here and perhaps the conservative @entity291 were startled by @entity2 ’s ambition			1
@entity42 's @entity224 leaves the pitch after his team were eliminated from the @entity10 by @entity2 @entity102 started up front for @entity2 in the absence of the injured @entity19 , but he endured a frustrating evening former @entity297 striker @entity82 looked threatening for @entity42 , but he could n't help the home side break city down @entity42 goalkeeper @entity72 denies @entity100 a shot at goal by smothering the ball at the @entity2 midfielder 's feet @entity2 's @entity305 midfielder @entity98 is on the receiving end of a slide tackle from @entity42 's @entity308 @entity42 needed to be more clinical - @entity309 they were disciplined , yet adventurous , as if with nothing to lose			1
having been pronounced dead after the @entity160 defeat , they were an almost supernatural presence in this competition : impossible to kill twice			0
of course , had @entity77 scored after five minutes it could have been very different			0
picked out by a long pass on the right of the six - yard box , he cut inside , improved his angle and hit a low shot that was met by @entity92 ’s first good save of the night			1
moments later , @entity224 struck a cross from the left that should have caused further problems — but @entity42 rarely got in behind @entity2 after that			0
@entity82 did his best to put his inconsistency at @entity297 behind him , and he attacked down the right flank after 21 minutes , firing a low effort past @entity92 that flew just wide of the far post — but not until @entity2 were ahead did @entity42 threaten consistently again			1
@entity102 and @entity42 defender @entity329 , who is on loan from @entity331 , are involved in a heated exchange @entity2 goalkeeper @entity92 picks up an object that is thrown in his direction from the crowd @entity102 had a few early chances , mostly set up by @entity97 , and should have done more with a glancing header and a close - range shot that he skied over the crossbar			1
yet as @entity42 went in search of a way back , it was a defender , @entity93 , who made sure of victory			0
he pounced on a pass from @entity1 and finished low past @entity72			1
it was a welcome sight — much like the return of @entity22 , introduced for @entity347 after 67 minutes — and it was a happy blue contingent who spilled out into the mild night			0
this is a team on the up , despite its handicaps			0
this may be as good as it has been for @entity2 in @entity134 ; but it might not be as good as it gets			0
@entity2 captain @entity21 watches from the stands after missing the game through injury @entity2 's travelling contingent of around 1,500 supporters for the crucial @entity10 contest @entity42 supporters provided a hostile and intimidating backdrop for the game at the @entity12			1

@entity1 and @entity93 send @entity2 into the @entity10 last 16
@entity50 's strike in the 60th minute was added to by @entity93 late on for @entity2 in @entity212
@entity366 ensured @entity2 finished second in @entity144 behind @entity36 , who beat @entity26 3 - 0
@entity36 's result against @entity26 meant a score draw would have been enough for @entity2 to qualify
@entity2 were without @entity19 , @entity21 ( both injured ) and @entity20 ( *suspended* )
@entity92 was @entity2 's man of the match , but @entity102 was *disappointing* up front
