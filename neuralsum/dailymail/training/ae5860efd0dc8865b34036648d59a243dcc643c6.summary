by @entity0 , @entity1 with the cost of watching live football rising every year , one owner of a club is instead offering to pay fans to come through the turnstiles			1
@entity8 , 33 , the owner and manager of newly formed non-league @entity10 , says he will give £ 2 to everyone that comes to watch his team play their first home game			1
he said that many people in the city feel priced out of watching their much bigger rival @entity17 in the @entity18 so he wanted to offer an alternative			1
generous : @entity8 has offered £ 2 to everyone who comes to the next @entity10 home game ' everyone in @entity10 is really proud of what @entity17 have achieved , ' he said			1
' but i speak to a lot of people who feel priced out and prices go through the roof when you are in the best league in the world			1
' i ’ve felt for a long time we needed a top non-league club and that ’s our goal			0
@entity17 started a long time ago by people playing at a similar level of football so i see this as the beginning of a journey for us and the fans that come along			0
' i ’m offering £ 2 to everyone that comes through the door , but if people come in and spend £ 4 - 5 then we could make a bit of money			2
we are doing pints of beer for £ 2 , food at discounted prices and we want it to be as affordable as possible			2
' if 500 people come through the door then i ’ll pay out £ 1,000 because i feel that sometimes you have to give before you get back			2
it ’s about offering an alternative and an incentive to come down and watching something a little bit different			0

he said : ' if we get five promotions then we will be in the conference so in five years time i want us to be a top non-league club			0
