by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 01:06 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 04:56 est , 22 november 2013 the @entity3 administration plans to delay by a full month the open enrollment period for @entity5 's second year , in a move that a @entity8 campaign strategist called ' nakedly political			1
' according to @entity11 , the @entity10 's official online portal for the @entity5 , enrollment for 2015 is scheduled to begin on october 15 , 2014 and end on december 7			2
but an @entity13 official said thursday that the schedule has been bumped back , beginning on november 15 , 2014 and ending on january 15 , 2015			0
that timetable will ensure that the midterm elections come and go before the new year 's insurance rates are published			0
' consumers will not see their 2015 premiums until after the midterm elections , instead of immediately before , ' an @entity20 @entity19 managing director @entity18 told @entity24			0
' one does n’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to divine the motive here			0
' the @entity28 attracted widespread scorn in july when the @entity30 also quietly announced a one - year delay of the @entity5 law 's employer mandate , shelving the implementation of its stiffest penalties past the 2014 midterms			1
cynical : the @entity28 will find itself losing even more public confidence from the move to push back @entity5 's year - two insurance enrollment period until after @entity40 the shadow knows : @entity13 secretary @entity42 has n't commented publicly on the new calendar , which will ensure many voters wo n't know their 2015 insurance rates until after they 've voted for members of congress ' how nakedly political can you get ? ' a @entity8 campaign strategist based in a southern @entity1 state asked when @entity52 reached him late on thursday			1
' are you kidding me ? this is like a high school delaying the sat until a few weeks after college acceptance letters come out , ' he said			0
' next they 're going to tell us that @entity62 wo n't put together his naughty - or - nice list until december 26			1
' an @entity13 official told @entity65 that the change is ' good news for consumers , who will have more time to learn about plans before enrolling			0
' but it will also postpone any resulting public sticker shock until after voters choose the members of the next @entity74			2
insurance companies will still be required to submit their policies to the federal government in mid-spring 2014 , but consumers getting their coverage through the government 's exchange will not find out how much they will pay until they shop online – 11 days after the election			1
@entity83 , an analyst at the investment firm @entity84 , told @entity24 that ' [ t ] he death of this law would be for health insurance companies to price policies for 2015 in a way that premiums skyrocket			2
at that point , it ’s a death spiral and it ’s over			0
' the makeup of the next @entity74 will have a greater impact on the future health of @entity5 itself than any other factor			0
@entity8 control of both the @entity28 and @entity99 could lead to a complete defunding of the program during president @entity3 's final two years in office			0
the administration has plunged ahead with the @entity5 despite public discontent , drawing charges that the @entity28 is putting political considerations before the practical needs of consumers all politics , all the time : republicans will be hopping mad , judging from the reaction of one @entity8 campaign insuder year - one enrollment in @entity5 's exchanges has been fraught with one disaster after another			2
the government 's online registration system 's crashes , along with millions of private insurance cancellation letters , have combined to drive down consumer confidence in president @entity3 's signature legislature achievement			1
a @entity125 poll released on wednesday showed that just 1 in 10 @entity1 believe the @entity5 's rollout is going well			1
fully 48 per cent say they want the law repealed .			1

voters in the insurance exchanges wo n't know until 11 days after the 2014 election just how much they *'ll* pay for coverage in 2015
the @entity30 *department* has already delayed implementation of the employer mandate , and its fines , until @entity40 has come and gone
millions of @entity1 are receiving private - insurance cancellation letters , with many experiencing sticker - shock when they learn their *options*
one poll released wednesday shows that 48 per cent of *taxpayers* now want the @entity5 law repealed
