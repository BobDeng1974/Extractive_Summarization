a @entity2 prisoner ’s secret diary telling an epic story of love , survival and adultery in a @entity8 internment camp has been discovered and returned to his daughter nearly 70 years after it was thought to have been destroyed			1
civil servant @entity10 risked death by keeping a meticulous record of daily life in @entity15 ’s @entity14 where some 2,800 mostly @entity2 civilians were held from 1942 until 1945 after @entity17 invaded the former colony			1
the neat pencil strokes of newly married @entity10 , whose pregnant wife @entity20 was evacuated as @entity17 troops closed in on @entity15 , detail the war ’s progress , the struggle to survive inside the brutal camp – and a passionate affair he had with a fellow internee			1
memento : the only surviving wedding photograph of @entity10 and wife @entity20 throughout the war , @entity10 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , bravely kept a @entity32 hidden inside his mattress and was hailed a hero when he was allowed to hoist it above @entity14 watched by @entity37 troops and hundreds of fellow camp survivors following the @entity17 surrender			1
then , soon after he arrived home in @entity2 at the end of the war to join @entity20 and daughter @entity43 , a parcel arrived from his lover – a nurse called @entity45 – with a letter telling besotted @entity10 to forget about her and begin a new life with his family			1
but it was @entity20 who opened the letter and then read the diary			1
heartbroken and angry , she tore up their wedding photos and the letters they had exchanged during the war and ordered @entity10 to destroy the diary			1
flag day : @entity10 proudly hoisting the @entity32 he kept stitched inside his mattress at the @entity14 when it was liberated after the @entity17 surrender their marriage survived and – although @entity10 pined for his lover – they returned to @entity15 where they had a second daughter , @entity65 , and @entity10 worked until 1957 when he was diagnosed with cancer and returned to @entity2 where he died			1
@entity20 lived until 1985 and went to her grave telling her daughters her greatest regret was destroying the diary , which provided a unique record of life as a civilian war prisoner			1
but now , in a remarkable twist , the diary has been returned to @entity10 ’s daughter , @entity75 , a 72 - year - old grandmother			1
it was discovered in @entity77 in 2010 by @entity78 , the daughter of another @entity15 civil servant , as she sorted through papers and books left by her father , who died in the mid- 1980s			1
@entity78 recognised its significance and tried to trace @entity43 , who is mentioned lovingly throughout			2
when she failed to find her , she sent the diary to @entity15 where it was put on display in a museum on the site of the former prison camp			1
@entity43 learned of the diary ’s existence when she was playing with a new @entity93 her grandson had helped her buy			1
she entered her name and ‘ @entity15 ’ into an internet search engine to see if there was any record of her childhood in the @entity100			2
it was then she saw a reference to the @entity103 in @entity15			2
the letter ‘ e ’ refers to @entity10 ’s middle name , @entity105			1
when stunned @entity43 got in touch with the museum , the authorities copied the pages for display , released the original and sent it to @entity43 ’s home in @entity115			2
‘ i just tapped ‘ ‘ @entity116 @entity15 ’ ’ on my @entity93 and up popped this list – and at the top of it were the words ‘ ‘ @entity103 ’ ’ , ’ explained @entity43 , a widow			2
‘ i shall never forget that moment			0
it was a feeling of shock – pure shock			0
and everything that has happened since has been so emotional and exciting and wonderful			0
how the diary survived the row between @entity10 and @entity20 is a mystery			1
‘ my mother described the destruction of the diary as her biggest regret			1
that is what we have lived with since , ’ @entity43 said			0
wartime record : the diary kept by @entity10 detailing everyday life in @entity14 ‘ after the war , @entity45 sent my father a parcel containing an atlas , which i still have			1
my mother opened the parcel , and it contained this ‘ ‘ @entity143 ’ ’ letter which she read			0
she was totally shocked and horrified and heartbroken			1
‘ they had this massive row where she ripped up all their wedding photographs and all the letters that had passed between them during the war			0
@entity148 said everything was destroyed , including the diary			2
‘ i was only five at the time and i do n’t remember the argument			0
i can only envisage a huge row			0
i imagine my father said , ‘ ‘ i ’ll go and burn the bloody thing , ’ ’ and went off with the diary , but did n’t burn it and she just assumed he had			2
’ @entity43 believes her father secretly sent the diary to @entity78 ’s father , @entity165 – who , like @entity10 , served in the @entity166 in @entity15 – or gave it to a fellow internee who later passed it to @entity78			1
‘ my father never once mentioned the diary and he obviously never mentioned it to my mother to spare her any more misery , ’ she said			2
the diary – by turns fascinating , mundane and mildly scandalous – records the daily hardships , deaths and the price of black - market goods inside the prison camp			1
it also tells of rumours that were circulating about the war ’s progress in @entity183 and the @entity184			0
@entity10 writes lovingly of @entity20 and daughter @entity43 , particularly on their birthdays and at @entity187 , before his romance with @entity45 – referred to as @entity189 – blossoms in the dying months of the war , leaving him torn between family life and his lover as he heads home			1
joyous day : @entity14 , which held mostly @entity2 civilians from 1942 to 1945 in a touching entry for january 22 , 1942 , he writes , clearly with his wife in mind : ‘ well darling , our @entity43 is 12 months old and i sincerely hope and pray that this , her first birthday , will be the first and last that we are parted until she leaves us to start a home of her own			2
i hope you had a nice little party sweetheart , with one candle on the cake			0
’ but the horrors of war are never far from his mind			0
on july 13 , 1942 , he says : ‘ @entity214 bombed last night			0
’ and in another entry a year later , he describes the dreadful conditions in the camp : ‘ joint protest being signed by all adult internees			0
it deals with all the problems that are becoming more acute daily : poor food , lack of drugs and medicines ; the increase of diseases caused through malnutrition ; the inadequacy of canteen supplies and money			2
’ during @entity10 ’s time in the prison camp , seven internees were tortured in front of fellow prisoners and later executed for possessing a radio set they used to pass messages in and out of the camp			1
many other prisoners died of illnesses linked to malnutrition			0
surrender : general @entity244 , left , and lt. gen. @entity245 , centre , watching @entity17 foreign minister @entity247 marking @entity17 's formal surrender to @entity250 forces on september 2 , 1945 after the @entity17 surrender , @entity43 lived with the painful fallout of the affair for the remainder of her otherwise idyllic childhood growing up in @entity15			1
a gregarious character before the war , @entity10 was morose and withdrawn afterwards			1
she said : ‘ as i was growing up , my mother would say , ‘ ‘ @entity259 , he was n’t always like this , ’ ’ ’ said @entity43			0
‘ people who knew him before the war say he was a charming , witty , loving man , but that is completely the opposite of the man i knew			0
everything i did he picked on			0
i had a hard time , and i assumed it was because the lady that ended the affair had said to him , ‘ ‘ you must stay with your wife and get to know the baby you have never met			1
’ ’ ’ @entity43 draws comfort from the many loving references to her mother and herself in the dairy			0
‘ you can see he was a very loving husband			0
he missed my mother terribly			0
he wrote to her regularly and , when i was born , he was thrilled , ’ @entity43 said			0
‘ he calls mum @entity279 and me @entity43 and on my birthday he talks about me			0
so it tells me that he was a normal , young married man , and that he changed			0
’ the war in @entity15 : @entity2 troops being made to march during a @entity287 victory parade younger sister @entity65 , who was just six when her father died , said : ‘ @entity148 regretted destroying the letters and wedding photographs but she was clearly heartbroken at the time			2
she would be delighted that the diary survived			2
‘ @entity148 said if she could have the time over again , she would do exactly the same – she clearly loved him very much			0
’ despite the rift her affair with @entity10 triggered , @entity43 and her sister are keen to trace the family of @entity45			1
‘ @entity65 and i wonder where she is , ’ she said			0
‘ because of what she did , our lives have been different to what they would otherwise have been			0
we wish we knew what happened to her , and we hope she found happiness			2
