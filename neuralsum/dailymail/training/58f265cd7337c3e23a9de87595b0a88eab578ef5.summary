by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 12:56 est , 4 may 2012 a sneering sex attacker found guilty of a string of brutal rapes has been handed his fifth life sentence – but told he could be back on the streets in little more than four years			1
@entity6 - branded a ‘ dangerous ’ predator ‘ who enjoys the act of rape ’ - was today given a life sentence for raping a 13 - year - old schoolgirl thirty years ago			1
he had already been serving four life terms following his conviction in 2007 for a series of sex attacks including raping three women between 2005 and 2006			1
predator : judge @entity19 , left , told @entity6 , right , that he ' enjoys the act of rape ' before imposing a life sentence which could be as short as four and a half years at @entity22 and it emerged after the latest trail at @entity22 , that @entity6 had previously been cleared on five separate occasions of raping women over two decades			1
he was found not guilty of rape during the 1980s and 90s – managing to convince the jury in each trial the alleged victim had consented to sex – but picked up a string of convictions for unlawful sex with teenage victims and sexual assault			2
but despite his horrific past , judge @entity19 imposed a life sentence which has a four - and - a - half year minimum tariff , meaning he will be eligible for release as early as 2016			1
judge @entity19 told him : ‘ i am satisfied you are dangerous , you are a man who enjoys the act of rape			1
‘ nobody knows when you will cease to be a danger to woman so the only sentence i can pass upon you is life			2
you will only be released when the parole board is satisfied you are safe to release			0
’ @entity6 was working as a mobile disc jockey when he targeted the young girl as she walked home alone in the early 1980s			2
the now 49 - year - old , from @entity56 , had once again denied his guilt but jurors convicted him of rape after just 90 minutes deliberation			1
the victim had told the court of the look of ‘ sheer power ’ on @entity6 ’s face when he attacked her all those years ago			1
it was only when the woman could not cope with keeping her ordeal secret , after three painful decades , she reported what had happened to her			0
horrific past : jurors heard some details of @entity6 's long history of brutal and predatory attacks on young girls and women over several decade during his trial at @entity22 judge @entity19 added : ‘ she was so frightened by the experience she did not think anyone would believe her over your inevitable denials and she kept the matter to herself for all those years			1

he offered lifts to the three women who had become separated from friends during nights out			0
one of his victims was subjected to a five hour ordeal			0
another victim , a 17 - year - old , told jurors she had resorted to showing @entity6 pictures of her family on her mobile phone and begging him to look at their faces to imagine how they would suffer if he killed her			1
one of the victims , who faced @entity6 while giving evidence from the witness box , told jurors : ‘ i ’ve never , ever in my life hated anyone as much as i hate that bloke			2
‘ it has got to the stage where i ’ve had nightmares about it , i ca n’t stop thinking about it			0
‘ for someone to have such an impact on somebody else ’s life like this , even after this many years , its just wrong			2
’ @entity6 admitted he offered lifts to the women but said they consented to any sexual activity which took place			2
he claimed to the jurors that the women seemed to ‘ enjoy ’ what happened and insisted they consented to sex			0
