by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 22 november 2012 when @entity3 's weight rocketed beyond 19 stone , he decided to do something about it			1
but instead of sharing his diet plans , the @entity9 man , now 24 , felt ' it was too embarrassing to tell my friends ' , and kept his new eating regime a secret from everyone apart from his mother			1
but @entity3 is not alone when it comes to clandestine calorie - counting : one in three men admits to dieting in secret , even though 90 per cent of them want to lose a bit of weight			1
@entity3 , 24 , from @entity9 , lost over four stone on a secret diet a new survey by home delivery diet brand @entity26 shows 31 per cent of men have been on a diet and kept it quiet			1
like @entity3 - who shocked his friends by dropping four stone on his hush - hush health kick - over 90 per cent of the men questioned want to lose weight , but nearly one in three would not divulge that they were dieting to friends or family			2
when questioned , 14 per cent said they see diets as something only women do , and 25 per cent would n't tell families and friends out of sheer embarrassment			0
some 29 per cent worry they would be seen as vain , and 18 per cent worry their family and friends would tempt them to break their diet with sugary and fatty treats			2
when questioned , 14 per cent of men said they see diets as something only women do , and 25 per cent would n't tell families and friends out of sheer embarrassment the average weight of the men questioned is 15st and 46 per cent of those want to lose an average of one to two stone to get to their perfect weight			0
some 29 per cent worry they would be seen as vain if people knew they were on a diet over a third of the men questioned admitted to being unable to control their weight because they love eating chocolate - a passion still thought to be the reserve of the fairer sex			2
pies and the full @entity77 are also two things men wish they could give up but just ca n't seem to resist , 29 per cent of men wish they could avoid these moreish dishes but struggle to find tasty , healthy alternatives with 26 per cent of men admitting they ca n't bear to eat salads as a main meal			0
@entity86 , founder & head chef at diet chef @entity89 , said : ' in modern society men are also very concerned about their appearance			0
' we have had a steady increase in the number of men who sign up to diet chef as it helps them bring a pattern of healthy eating and portion control into their lives			0
' a lot of the men use the diet plan specifically because it is a way for them to become healthy and see steady progress whilst still enjoying complete meals and healthy snacks			0
' @entity3 , who has lost over four and a half stone ( 63lbs ) in total on his secret diet , said : ' the best thing about losing the weight is it is such a good feeling when you see friends or people you know that have n't seen you for a few weeks and the looks on their faces , they do a double take and some even have to check if it is really you ! ' it ’s also great that i can go shopping for clothes now and look at what i want to buy rather than check there ’s a size that will fit me before i decide if i like it or not ! '			1
