by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:42 est , 20 january 2013 updated : 08:01 est , 21 january 2013 criticism : @entity4 's top civil servant sir @entity3 was lambasted last night by mps for his bungled probe into the ' @entity8 ' row which cost former minister @entity9 his job @entity4 ’s top civil servant was lambasted last night by mps for his bungled probe into the ‘ @entity8 ’ row which cost former minister @entity9 his job			1
a damning report by an influential commons committee castigated cabinet secretary sir @entity3 for failing to conduct a proper investigation into discrepancies between the police version of events and cctv footage			1
@entity21 today defended the top mandarin , insisting @entity23 stood by the much - criticised report			1
the former chief whip was forced to resign over allegations that he called a policeman a ‘ f * * * ing pleb ’ after he refused to let him cycle through the gates of @entity21			2
mr @entity9 says he was the victim of a conspiracy			1
the @entity34 public administration committee ’s report concludes that sir @entity3 , who earns £ 190,000 a year , is not an ‘ appropriate ’ person to conduct inquiries into accusations of ministerial misconduct			1
the report is a humiliation for the man who is so powerful that he is known as mr @entity23 ’s ‘ right - hand mandarin ’			1
in their investigation on @entity8 , the @entity12 found that sir @entity3 : one senior parliamentary source said : ‘ if the cabinet secretary had done his job properly , it is highly unlikely @entity9 would have had to resign			1
the police claims would have crumbled			1
’ @entity50 , chairman of the committee , said sir @entity3 ’s investigation ‘ clearly failed to uncover the truth ’			1
he added : ‘ the cabinet secretary attempted to investigate this matter but failed to resolve or even to investigate the questions arising from the discrepancies in the accounts of the events , or to advise the prime minister that they required further investigation			1
’ @entity3 faces humiliation over his inept handling of the ' @entity8 ' inquiry , which cost @entity66 chief whip @entity9 his job sir @entity3 told the committee two weeks ago that he had suspicions that mr @entity9 might have been the victim of a ‘ gigantic conspiracy ’ by the police			1
despite this , the report found that he failed to conduct a proper inquiry			2
it said : ‘ sir @entity3 should have advised the prime minister that these questions required further investigation and therefore a wider inquiry			1
’ today mr @entity23 's official spokesman told a regular @entity82 media briefing : ' as regards the review that the cabinet secretary undertook , the prime minister remains absolutely of the view that it was the right review at the right time			1
' he fully supported the conclusion it reached - that the additional information received ( in two emails ) could not be considered reliable - and so the prime minister 's initial conclusion was unchanged			1
' by @entity93 one of the first calls @entity23 makes when he starts work in the @entity21 flat at 5.45am is to cabinet secretary sir @entity3			1
he is one of the last people he speaks to at night			0
no civil servant in modern times has enjoyed such unrivalled power as @entity3 , who has served three chancellors and three prime ministers			2
today , however , he faces humiliation after an excoriating report by the @entity34 public administration committee into his inept handling of the ‘ @entity8 ’ inquiry , which cost @entity66 chief whip @entity9 his job			1
despite his blunders , no major decision is made without the pm consulting the @entity111 lookalike cabinet secretary : the pm walks with @entity3 ( right ) and sir @entity112 cabinet secretary and @entity113 ( middle ) if a minister was subjected to such damning criticism he would be unlikely to survive the ensuing firestorm			1
for now , @entity3 continues to enjoy the full confidence of the prime minister			1
yet the committee ’s criticism that @entity3 was not rigorous enough is all too familiar			2
last summer , sir @entity122 feared the bidding process for the multi-billion - pound @entity125 rail franchise was going against his company , which ran the line			2
the @entity129 train boss was sure the @entity131 ’s figures were wrong			2
in a series of letters he warned the pm , but to no avail			0
who did the pm pass the correspondence to ? sir @entity3 , of course			2
the cabinet secretary sought assurances from the @entity131 , and reported back to mr @entity23 that nothing was amiss			1
only later did it emerge that the mistakes officials made in calculating the bids – which led to the decision to award the franchise to @entity129 ’s rival @entity147 being scrapped – will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds			2
@entity3 was the driving force last year behind the move to hand control of @entity153 , one of @entity4 's last major manufacturers , to a @entity157 consortium , a move which , surprisingly @entity23 backed one ministerial source said : ‘ @entity3 never asked the right questions			1
’ the same criticism is made of him today over ‘ @entity8 ’			0
despite his blunders , no major decision is made without the pm consulting the @entity111 lookalike cabinet secretary			0
@entity3 , the @entity110 ’s chief adviser and confessor , attends the daily strategy meeting – a select group that includes chancellor @entity168 and chief of staff @entity169			2
he sits next to @entity23 at @entity172 meetings			1
he keeps the minutes , but his power extends far beyond taking notes			0
he has a desk outside the pm ’s study so he can see who goes in and out			2
@entity3 has exploited his place in the privileged inner circle to stray deep into areas of policy so who is this teflon - coated sir @entity183 ? @entity3 , 51 , attended the private @entity184 in @entity185 , which was run by the @entity186			2
his family were not @entity186 , but his father taught @entity189 at the school			0
he won a scholarship to @entity192 , studying history and economics , and joined the civil service after gaining a masters in economics at the @entity198			0
it was at the @entity200 in the early 1990s that he met a youthful adviser to @entity202 named @entity23			1
they have been close ever since			0
at the @entity200 , he also met his wife @entity204 , a high - flyer at management consultants @entity206			0
@entity3 , who is paid £ 190,000 and took a bonus last year despite calls for public sector pay restraint , lives in a £ 2million house in @entity214 , @entity215 , where he had a walk - in wine cellar built in the basement			0
and he is not averse to letting his hair down a little			0
before @entity219 , he threw a party for senior civil servants at home			0
as the wine flowed , @entity3 challenged sir @entity224 , the head of the @entity225 , to a game of pool on a miniature table owned by one of his children			2
but then this is a man who has long been used to being on the winning side , in politics as in life			0
he was hand - picked by @entity236 to be his private secretary and stayed at the @entity238 under @entity239			0
after serving two @entity242 prime ministers , it was assumed that @entity3 would go when @entity23 arrived in @entity21			1
but @entity23 , delighted at being reunited with his former colleague , knighted him and promoted him to cabinet secretary			1
today , he ’s the only civil servant in the ‘ @entity245 ’ – the small group of public school - educated men and women who are utterly loyal to mr @entity23 , and are cheerleaders for the modernisation of the @entity66			1
@entity125 rail bid : @entity129 's @entity253 was sure the @entity131 's figures were wrong , but @entity3 reported to the pm that they were correct - an error that will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds unlike his predecessors , @entity3 has exploited his place in the privileged inner circle to stray deep into areas of policy			0
he has even banished all @entity263 from the no 10 policy unit , which is now run by civil servants			0
is it any wonder the government is bereft of any policies to excite the @entity66 faithful ? @entity3 was the driving force last year behind the move to hand control of @entity153 , one of @entity4 ’s last major manufacturers , to a @entity157 consortium			0
to the astonishment of many @entity263 , the prime minister was supportive of the deal , which eventually collapsed			1
one minister said tartly : ‘ it was bad for @entity282 , and @entity3 should have been nowhere near it			0
’ not least because there was what many regarded as a conflict of interest			0
the bank advising on the deal , and earning millions in fees , was @entity290 , where @entity3 had been a senior director for five years until 2008 , having left @entity21 to gain private sector experience			0
he was also head of the @entity290 team which advised on the sale of the care home chain @entity295 in 2006 to a @entity297 private equity firm			0
the deal unravelled and 3,000 jobs were lost			0
@entity3 ’s tentacles have even stretched to welfare , one of the few areas where the government is making progress			0
it was leaked in the autumn that @entity3 opposed some of welfare secretary @entity309 ’s flagship changes			0
the welfare secretary ’s supporters are furious			0
‘ it ’s a key area of our work and an unelected civil servant is trying to scupper it , ’ said a friend of @entity309			0
‘ @entity23 should rein him in			2
’ but he wo n’t , because @entity3 has learned how to reinforce the @entity110 ’s natural instincts			0
indeed , so potent is the hold that the @entity321 - supporting mandarin has on @entity23 that ministers are careful to whisper their criticisms			1
as one said : ‘ @entity23 trusts @entity3 far more than his ministers			2
’ that relationship will be tested by the committee ’s findings today .			0

discrepancies between police version of events and cctv footage was not investigated
@entity335 defends top mandarin despite not investigating use of word ' pleb '
failed to check the accuracy of the police *log* which claimed mr @entity9 used the word pleb ;
failed to investigate discrepancies between police claims and @entity333 footage which shows the clash was much shorter than described ;
failed to discuss the case with a no 10 official who had spoken to one of the policemen involved ;
failed to devote enough time to the investigation ;
failed to advise mr @entity23 to refer the case to sir @entity359 , the prime minister ’s @entity360 ; and
failed to refer any *suspected* discrepancies in the policemen ’s accounts to the *relevant* police authorities .
