a controversial pause in global warming may be due to heat vanishing into the depths of the @entity4 and @entity5			1
but surface temperatures will start rising again in a decade , according to scientists in the @entity8			1
the massive movement of heat is thought to explain why the rapid rate of climate change that marked the end of the 20th century has ground almost to a halt			1
the top image shows global average surface temperatures , where black dots are yearly averages			1
the middle image of heat content , compared to the average , in the north @entity4			1
the bottom image shows the salinity of the seawater a sudden shift in northern @entity4 salinity , making water saltier and dense , is believed to have triggered the effect			1
' when it 's heavy water on top of light water , it just plunges very fast and takes heat with it , ' said professor @entity41 , one of the study authors from the @entity43			1
since the turn of the century , little increase in the average temperature of the @entity47 's surface has been recorded			1
at first the unexpected finding was thought to have been no more than a blip , but then it began to divide the scientific community			0
more than a dozen theories have been proposed to explain the global warming ' hiatus ' ranging from air pollution to volcanoes and sunspots			1
' every week there 's a new explanation of the hiatus , ' said professor @entity41			0
' many of the earlier papers had necessarily focused on symptoms at the surface of the @entity47 , where we see many different and related phenomena			0
we looked at observations in the ocean to try to find the underlying cause			0
' this schematic shows the trends in temperature and ocean atmosphere circulation in the @entity74 over the past two decades			0
colour shading shows observed temperature trends ( ° c per decade ) during 1992 - 2011 at the sea surface			2
the bold and thin arrows show an overall acceleration of the @entity74 moving warm , surface waters ( indicated by the blue arrow ) to below 700 metres beneath the surface professor @entity41 's team analysed recent recordings of deep sea temperatures from @entity88 floats , oceanographic sensors that can move vertically through the water column			1
water sampled at depths down to 6,500 feet ( 2,000 metres ) showed an upsurge in heat sinking in around 1999 , the year when global warming suddenly slowed down			2
the scientists believe the downward migration of heated water , which is not seen in the @entity74 , is part of a naturally occurring cycle			2
the global average temperature has risen only slightly since 1998 – which is surprising , considering scientific climate models predicted considerable warming due to rising greenhouse gas emissions			2
some people used this apparent contradiction to question climate change per se – or at least the harm potential caused by greenhouse gases – as well as the validity of the climate models			2
meanwhile , the majority of climate researchers continued to emphasise that the short - term ‘ warming hiatus ’ could largely be explained on the basis of current scientific understanding and did not contradict longer term warming			0
recently , researchers have been looking into the possible causes of the warming hiatus over the past few years			0
in a separate study , @entity120 recently concluded that two important factors are equally responsible for the hiatus			0
one of the important reasons is natural climate fluctuations , of which the weather phenomena @entity128 and @entity129 in the @entity74 are the most important , they claim			0
according to the study , the second important reason for the warming hiatus is that radiation from the sun has been weaker than predicted in the past few years			0
' there are recurrent cycles that are salinity - driven that can store heat deep in the @entity4 and @entity5 oceans			1
after 30 years of rapid warming in the warm phase , now it 's time for the cool phase , ' professor @entity41 said			0
the cycle starts when dense , salty water near @entity147 starts to sink			0
this changes the speed of the huge @entity4 ocean current that circulates heat around the world			1
historical data suggests that similar events in the past have lasted for 20 to 35 years			0
the phenomenon may have been responsible for a cooling period between 1945 and 1975 which sparked fears of a new @entity159			0
global warming is likely to pick up again in another 15 years or so , when heat returns to the surface waters , say the researchers			2
@entity165 climate expert professor @entity164 , from the @entity166 , said : ' it will be very interesting to see whether their finding that during the last decade the heat has penetrated to depth mostly in the @entity172 and @entity4 stands up			1
' it does make oceanographic sense however , because we know these are the major sites for deeper water formation - water from the surface @entity74 does not penetrate nearly so deeply into the ocean			1
' ' the hiatus has a really interesting morphology , ' said @entity182 , @entity183 at the @entity184			0
' this paper suggests that heat disappearing into the depths of the @entity4 and @entity5 oceans are the dominant cause			1
their ideas seem fine but i 'm also convinced there is more going on			0
' most importantly , this paper is another nail in the coffin of the idea that the hiatus is evidence that our projections of long - term climate change need revising down			2
' variability in the ocean will not affect long - term climate trends but may mean we have a period of accelerated warming to look forward to			2
' shown here are the global monthly mean sea - surface temperature ( @entity211 ) anomalies from 1961 - 90			0
sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean 's surface			1
an anomaly is a departure from average conditions			0
some scientists believe winds in central and eastern parts of the @entity74 have caused warm surface water to sink to the ocean 's depths			1

this could explain the rapid change in climate at the end of 20th century
it was triggered by a *dramatic* change in northern @entity4 water salinity
heavy water on the top plunged to bottom of ocean , taking heat with it
other theories range from pollution to volcanoes and changes in sunspots
surface temperatures will start rising again in a decade , scientists say
