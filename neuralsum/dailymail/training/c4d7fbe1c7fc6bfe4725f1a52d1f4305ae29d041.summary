by @entity0 published : 19:52 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 19:56 est , 10 march 2014 representative sample ? reporter @entity3 contacted staff from his former workplace to talk about how police are perceived in @entity7 @entity8 yesterday admitted misleading viewers with a report on policing in which the interviewees worked for the same company			1
in the wake of last week ’s allegations of corruption and cover - up in the @entity20 murder inquiry , the broadcaster commissioned a ‘ vox pop ’ to gauge views on the police in @entity23			1
however , instead of finding a representative sample of opinion , the reporter contacted staff from the office he had worked in before joining @entity8			1
the report has provoked fury from residents in @entity7 , south @entity23 , who said it suggested everyone in the area distrusted the police			1
@entity38 mp @entity37 condemned the broadcaster , saying : ‘ this is very disappointing from @entity41			2
a distorted report could have been very unhelpful , indeed inflammatory , and i hope the people concerned have learnt an important lesson			1
’ the feature was screened last thursday with the strap line : ‘ our reporter , @entity3 , spent the day in @entity7 , south @entity23 , to test out what residents there felt about the police			1
’ mr @entity3 interviewed controversial race equalities adviser @entity52 and five staff at the marketing agency @entity54 , which describes its work as youth engagement and lists @entity8 among its clients			1
only one of them , youth development mentor @entity58 , was credited on screen as an employee , leaving viewers to assume the others were a representative sample of residents			2
their reflections on the police were overwhelmingly negative			0
mr @entity3 concluded : ‘ i found little hope of change here but a community still fighting for parity			0
’ a resident established that the interviewees were all linked and posted his findings on a popular local website , @entity77 , which broke the story			0
the storm forced the broadcaster to remove the report from its website			2
a spokesman said : ‘ this was a quick turnaround project , the journalist interviewed people who live , work or were born in @entity7 – who also worked for @entity54			1
they all expressed their own individual views			0
we accept we should have been clear that they all worked at the same place , we should have made further enquiries and we regret this oversight			0
’ writing on online message boards , viewers condemned @entity8 for broadcasting the misleading report			2
one said : ‘ i ’m a journalist but would never dream of pulling such a stunt			0
it ’s mind - blowingly unethical			0
@entity8 should at least acknowledge that something went badly wrong			0
pulling the video and stuff is not a good look for any news organisation			0
’ another added : ‘ it ’s difficult enough to find any accurate and non-superficial reporting on @entity7 , and this sort of nonsense does n’t help			1
’ broadcasting watchdog @entity112 said it had received one complaint yesterday and is considering whether to launch an investigation .			0
