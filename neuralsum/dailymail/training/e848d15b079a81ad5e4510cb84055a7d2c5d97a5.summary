holster the young guns , the old fellas are not quite ready to step aside for the new wave of talent in men ’s tennis			1
these @entity6 have seen the emerging prospects come close to cracking the superiority of the established quartet of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
the barometer will ultimately be a new name on one of the @entity18 trophies or , at the very least , a final not contested by one of those four			1
incredible : @entity13 will play his 25th @entity18 final on sunday no major sport is more in need of new winners ; no old guard is putting up more of a fight			2
in context , today ’s meeting between @entity13 and @entity11 will be the 38th @entity18 final since one of the current ‘ @entity31 ’ was not involved ; in that time only two other men — @entity33 and @entity34 — have crashed the gates of the winner ’s circle			2
it is a situation that will change , naturally , but not quite yet , despite the charges of @entity40 and @entity41 , both 23 , to the @entity43 semi-finals			1
behind them , 19 - year - old @entity44 and @entity45 , 24 , are part of a group taking large strides up the rankings , @entity44 reaching the last eight and @entity45 already up to 12th in the world			2
it ’s a slow passing of the torch but one , you can see , is already happening			1
@entity40 , who battered @entity12 before running into @entity11 ’s brick wall , put it best , saying : ‘ we are already in that space , if you think about it			1
quarters [ @entity44 ] , semis [ @entity64 , @entity41 ] — it ’s just a matter of jumping over that next hurdle			1
we are all for attacking the top			2
‘ as soon as it comes to clutch matches , like those ones against @entity12 , @entity11 , whoever else i have to play , this is where i want to get into that next gear and bring all my goods to the court			2
experience : @entity77 2 @entity11 will contest his eighth @entity18 final ‘ but i think the rest is just a matter of time			2
’ for @entity13 , a 25th @entity18 final beckons against a man going into his 14th			0
the @entity85 said : ‘ it was always going to be hard to get rid of all four guys at the same time , let ’s be honest			0
‘ it ’s a big shock			1
in @entity90 , there was one [ of the old guard ] left in the final ; here there are two again			0
at the @entity94 it was two			0
he added : ‘ i said before the tournament that it was probably going to be one of the [ older ] guys in the finals			0
@entity11 did his end ; i was hoping i was going to be the other one			0
so i ’m very happy with that			0
‘ @entity41 and @entity40 have both been around for a while now			1
‘ it ’s not like they came about just this year			0
they have been on tour for five , six years now , so it ’s not somebody entirely new			0
‘ but with @entity44 , he ’s a totally different situation			0
we hope we have more of the @entity44 type , the teenagers coming through			0
but i am happy to see that @entity40 , @entity41 , all those guys , are knocking on the door more consistently now			1
we ’ll see how the year plays out , if a few guys can make it to the @entity117 at the end of the year			0
’ to that end , with @entity12 set to fall to 10th in the world , some or all of @entity45 , @entity41 and @entity40 could net a debut spot in the @entity117 in @entity124			1
but for now , they are still waiting for the torch to be passed .			1

young talent are *impressing* but it will still be a big four name on the trophy
@entity40 and @entity41 made it to the semis but they *'re* not quite there yet
the torch is being passed but it is a slow *process*
big four *contenders* are far from willing to give up just yet
