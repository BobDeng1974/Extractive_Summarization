the majestic humpback whale is one of the most enigmatic creatures of the deep sea			1
when it surfaces , this acrobatic mammal can throw itself out of the water completely			0
but under the waves , the creature lives a life of mystery			0
now a group of underwater divers from @entity12 has captured the incredible humpback whale enjoying one of life 's everyday pleasures : a long , peaceful nap			1
other species of whale sleep while drifting horizontally – a behaviour known as ' logging ' - while others rest on the bottom ' we encountered a sleeping humpback whale and managed to get an in - water encounter with her , ' @entity30 from the group , known as @entity32 wrote on @entity37			1
' this is a short clip of a 20 minute encounter showing her come up to breathe and check us out			1
' for a long time , people believed that whales never really slept with some pointing to the fact that some have one eye open when resting			1
sweet dreams : for a long time , people believed that whales never really slept with some pointing to the fact that some had one eye open when resting			2
but researchers have now found out that whales only allow one side of their brain to sleep at a time , so that they remember to breathe but researchers have now found out that whales only allow one side of their brain to sleep at a time , so that they remember to breathe			1
this is because , unlike humans , humpback whales breathe voluntarily with the time frame between breaths anything from 50 minutes to two hours			1
males measure 40 - 48 feet ( 12.2 - 14.6 m ) , while females measure 45 - 50 feet ( 13.7 - 15.2 m )			2
they can weight between 25 to 40 tons ( 22,680 - 36,287 kg )			0
their flippers are very long , between a qyarter and a third of their body length			0
their tail , which can be 18ft ( 5.5 m ) wide , is serrated and pointed at the tips			0
they live mostly in polar to tropical waters , including in the @entity81 and @entity80			0
humpbacks migrate at 3 - 9 mph ( 4.8 - 14 kph ) and can travel over 3,100 miles ( 5000 km ) during each seasonal migration on average , these incredible creatures have a life expectancy of 45 - 50 years in this video , the humpback whale sleeps upside - down			1
other species of whale sleep while drifting horizontally – a behaviour known as ' logging ' - while others rest on the bottom			2
sperm whales , however , sleep vertically near the surface of the water			2
this was discovered several years ago when a team of researchers off the coast of northern @entity102 stumbled upon a pod of vertically bobbing sperm whales			2
strangely , none of the whales responded to the team 's presence until one of them was gently nudged , making it swim away with the rest of the group			1
researchers also believe that whales can dream			0
in one study , scientists with the @entity116 of @entity117 found that the grey whale could sleep in various states of consciousness			0
sometimes , when resting on the bottom , the whales would exhibit sudden twitches or contractions , combined with eyelid movement , suggesting that they may have been dreaming			0

*footage* captured by a group of divers from @entity12 called @entity32
it shows the humpback whale sleeping before it comes up for *air*
humpback whales breathe voluntarily every 50 minutes to two hours
they shut off half their brain when *snoozing* so they remember to breathe
