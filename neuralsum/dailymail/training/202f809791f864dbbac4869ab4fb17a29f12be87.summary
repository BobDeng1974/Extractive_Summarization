by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 09:07 est , 3 august 2013 @entity1 : @entity2 has made a steady rise up the social ladder to borrow the vernacular of the high - powered @entity7 banking circles in which she now moves , @entity2 bears the look of someone who has ‘ bagged the elephant ’			1
after all , the prospect of being the mother to @entity17 ’s first child will , one imagines , open many doors in the glitzy social strata she has made it her business to frequent , not to mention access to the @entity23 mogul ’s £ 225million fortune			1
certainly @entity24 - born @entity2 gives every indication of knowing exactly where she is going : upwards			1
friends in the @entity28 describe her as ‘ determined and ambitious ’			0
which , depending on whom you believe , could be a euphemism for a gold digger who ’ll let nothing and nobody stop her rise to notoriety and money			0
whatever the case , there are a couple of spanners in the works			0
last night sources close to @entity17 were making it plain that he has no intention of marrying her			1
one of his friends said : ‘ @entity17 and @entity2 are in a relationship , they are very happy – she ’s been good for him			1
they are a couple and @entity17 will just pay for their child			2
he will step up and be a part of the life of the child … but @entity17 is saying privately that he has absolutely no plans to marry @entity2			1
’ then there is the small matter of the fact she is still married to her banker and property developer husband of ten years , @entity66			1
but not for much longer			0
a furious @entity2 has filed divorce papers in @entity69 which name @entity17 as her lover and accuse his wife of ‘ cruel and inhuman treatment ’			1
the prospect of an imminent divorce is , no doubt , a relief to 37 - year - old mr @entity66 ’s highly respectable and wealthy parents , @entity77 and @entity78			1
they were said to be so aghast at their son ’s choice of bride that they refused to attend the wedding in 2003 in the fabulously elegant old - money confines of the @entity88 hotel in @entity90 ’s @entity89			0
‘ @entity66 ’s parents did not approve of who she was , ’ a source close to the @entity92 said last @entity93 is a chief executive officer of the family ’s @entity69 - based @entity95 property company			1
his company literature says he has ‘ instilled his strong family values and unimpeachable standards ’ in his sons @entity66 and @entity104			1
sources close to the family say it was just these morals that lay behind their suspicion of @entity2			1
so what was it about @entity2 that put this well - to - do family ’s teeth on edge ? in a word , money			1
she seems to have revelled in it , and the access to high society it brought her			0
but undeterred by her in - laws ’ disapproval , @entity2 – who has a seven - year - old son , @entity125 , with @entity2 – continued her rise through the ranks of @entity69 ’s wealthy and connected			2
fears : @entity17 could be forced to reveal financial details of his life in his pregnant lover @entity2 's divorce battle with her estranged husband @entity66 she was brought up in comfortable , upper - middle - class surroundings			1
her father , @entity135 , 61 , is an accountant , who lives with his new wife , @entity136 , in @entity24			0
@entity2 ’s mother is @entity138 , 60 , an estate agent who has also remarried			2
a rapid social climb such as @entity2 ’s is likely to rub some people up the wrong way			1
at the apartment on @entity69 ’s exclusive @entity143 where she lived with @entity66 until she moved out last month , she was , by all accounts , far from popular			2
yesterday , one well - heeled neighbour dismissively described her as ‘ a diva princess since she met @entity66 ’			2
another resident at the £ 4million high - rise reportedly hissed : ‘ she is the troublemaker			0
’ @entity2 ’s mother @entity138 jumped to her defence yesterday , saying : ‘ she ’s a nice girl			2
her marriage was not a marriage made in heaven			0
my daughter is a wonderful girl and a wonderful mother			0
’ she spoke out after claims emerged that her daughter has already allegedly issued @entity17 with a string of demands , telling him she wants marriage , her own reality tv show and – oddly – a house in the @entity166 before she will allow him access to the child			2
close : @entity17 appearing to kiss @entity2 on a yacht off the coast of @entity171 , @entity172 in august 2012 more than just friends ? reports claim the couple 's romance has been going on since at least 2012			1
her husband believed the romance started in the spring certainly , for all her soon - to - be ex-husband ’s wealth – though significantly it is @entity66 ’s father who owns the @entity90 flat where the couple lived – it is clear @entity17 is another large step up the financial ladder			1
@entity2 grew up in a smart but less than grand £ 650,000 family home in suburban @entity189 , @entity24 , and attended @entity190 , which is private and costs £ 19,000 a year			1
her desire to get on is , seemingly , in the genes			0
for several years her mother has taken a three - month summer rental on a seven - bedroom , seven - bathroom house in the upmarket enclave of @entity198 , in @entity199			0
@entity2 is currently holidaying there with her son			2
the @entity202 , where the likes of sir @entity204 have homes , has given the @entity135 clan access to rich neighbours – rather higher society than the daughter of an accountant and estate agent might be expected to inhabit			0
what is confusing many of their friends is just how @entity2 was able , apparently , to be so blind about the emerging relationship between his wife and @entity17			1
it was @entity66 who introduced @entity17 to her in 2006 at the @entity221 hotel in @entity222 , where the 53 - year - old music mogul spends every @entity224 , and the three struck up an instant friendship			1
in january 2012 , @entity2 and @entity66 were photographed aboard @entity228 , the yacht @entity17 rents for his twice - yearly holidays			1
then in august 2012 @entity2 joined @entity17 on @entity228 again with his harem of women , including @entity2 ’s best friend , fashion designer @entity233 , and @entity17 ’s ex , the singer @entity235 , in @entity171			1
snapshot : a picture posted online by @entity2 of herself in a bikini , snuggling with @entity17 on his yacht during a holiday as they were : it appears that the divorce battle between @entity2 and @entity66 could turn into an ugly one and a few months ago , @entity2 posted photos of herself in a bikini on the yacht during another trip off @entity248 ’s in january			1
yesterday , a close friend of @entity2 ’s blamed the breakdown of her marriage and her growing closeness to @entity17 on her husband frequently travelling abroad for business			1
@entity255 , who has known her for ten years , said @entity2 and the pop mogul had been best friends for years but that their feelings for each other had only recently changed			2
‘ they were close friends and then one day it turned into something else , ’ said @entity255			0
‘ @entity2 did n’t plan any of this			2
it ’s not some kind of trick			0
i know one thing for sure , they are in love with each other			0
i hope they will get married and be happy for ever			0
’ @entity255 , who owns a day spa in @entity90 , said she saw @entity66 a week ago			2
‘ she told me she was pregnant with @entity17 ’s baby			2
‘ i said , “ @entity2 , are you happy ? ” and she said , “ yes , i ’m thrilled ”			2
she told me @entity17 is happy to have a child			2
she was a little bit stressed , of course , because it ’s a difficult situation			0
but she is in love and she is happy			0
’ @entity255 says her friend is different from the other women @entity17 surrounds himself with			0
‘ @entity2 never took anything from @entity17 , she never expected anything			1
i think that ’s why , for @entity17 , @entity2 is special , ’ she said			1
‘ women have always been jealous of her			0
she ’s beautiful , she ’s married to a millionaire			0
she has a driver , and a house here [ in @entity69 ] and in the @entity202			0
@entity66 is a rich man and she is used to this life			0
’ @entity292 : @entity2 , seen here in @entity198 , @entity69 , on thursday blooming : @entity2 is said to be around 10 weeks into the pregnancy , and displayed he growing figure in a black maxi dress as she headed out @entity255 added that her friend will be a ‘ wonderful mother ’ to @entity17 ’s baby			1
be that as it may , only days before she conceived @entity17 ’s child he was still denying their relationship even existed			0
two months ago , @entity17 instructed his high - profile @entity28 attorney , @entity304 , to issue a forceful statement to an @entity28 celebrity blogger denying a relationship			0
@entity304 wrote : ‘ any implication or statement that my client is engaged in adultery and has allegedly broken up the marriage of ms @entity2 is not only false but reckless			0
’ he added : ‘ stating my client ’s relationship with @entity2 has become more serious such that she is now getting a divorce so that @entity17 and she can be together ... is false and defamatory			1
’ all of which now makes @entity17 look a bit silly			0
one thing that ’s for sure , however , is that he will have his hands full with his social climbing and fiercely ambitious pregnant lover .			0

@entity2 is a rapid social climber who does *n't* mind ' rubbing people up the wrong way '
sources close to @entity17 describe the chances of him marrying her as slim
the family of her husband @entity66 never accepted @entity2
@entity66 's filed divorce papers accuses her of cruel and inhuman treatment
