by @entity0 published : 09:32 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 09:58 est , 4 march 2014 all for himself : @entity3 has denied that he is feuding with director @entity4 while new sources have claimed that @entity3 refused to share the writing credit with @entity4 screenwriter @entity3 has denied that he is feuding with 12 years a slave director @entity4 even though they omitted each other from their @entity11 speeches			1
when asked if the omission was purposeful , @entity3 said : ' of course not			0
i had less than two minutes to thank everybody , and i was so caught up in the emotion of the moment when i was onstage , ' he told the @entity18 at the @entity20 afterparty			0
despite @entity3 's reassurances , inside sources have confirmed that @entity4 is bitter because he asked to share the writing credit for the film and @entity3 denied him			1
the first public hint of a rift came during the @entity11 telecast sunday night when @entity4 remained expressionless when his film won the screenplay award			2
@entity3 returned the favor by not hugging anyone related to ' 12 years ' opting instead to cross the aisle and give his former colleague , @entity35 director @entity34 , a hug			2
the wrap reports that the frostiness between the @entity40 director and @entity42 screenwriter has been developing for months			0
unidentified sources told @entity44 that @entity4 , who was the a producer and the director of the film , asked @entity3 to share the writing credit with him as well			1
heading home : @entity4 , seen leaving @entity49 on monday , reportedly mad that he was n't given a co-writing credit even though his wife was the one to find the book that the movie was based on trouble : @entity4 reportedly ordered @entity3 and his wife @entity54 to sit far removed from the rest of the ' 12 years ' group at the @entity57 and ended up screaming at @entity54 while her husband was in the bathroom such a request is not unusual in the industry , especially since it was his wife who flagged up @entity63 's book which ended up serving as the basis of the film			1
on top of that , @entity4 has been listed as the co-writer on his two other feature films			0
@entity3 reportedly denied the request , but that did n't stop @entity4 from going to the film 's production company , @entity74 , to urge them to step in on his behalf			1
@entity74 , which is led by @entity77 , ended up siding with @entity3 but they were determined to keep everyone quiet about the rift because they thought it would ruin the film 's chances of winning over @entity11 voters and taking home the @entity88 win			2
@entity4 was apparently the most difficult part of that plan , however , since the emotional director made very clear moves to distance himself from @entity3			2
while ' 12 years ' cleaned up at awards season , @entity4 would very rarely mention @entity3 in acceptance speeches			1
bizarre : rather than smile , @entity4 only gave @entity3 an unenthusiastic open - palm clap , and it is now rumored that he wanted a credit as a co-writer for the film like he has received in his last two pictures stoic : @entity4 was effusive when @entity102 won @entity103 but showed no such love for @entity3 , only giving this perfunctory clap as he walked towards the stage moving right past : as @entity3 went on stage to collect his screenwriting @entity11 , he did not stop and hug anyone related to the film who were all sitting in front of him , including director @entity4 ( right ) at the @entity114 , he only mentioned @entity3 after another producer reminded him to do so while on stage			1
at the @entity57 , @entity4 mandated that @entity3 and his wife be seated away from the rest of the ' 12 years ' group			1
@entity4 went on to scream at @entity3 's wife @entity54 and tried to take her event souvenirs while her husband was in the bathroom			1
for his part , @entity3 has tried to tone down the rhetoric about their feud , praising the director at @entity11 parties			0
' listen , without @entity4 i would nâ€™t have this @entity11 tonight , ' he told @entity131			0
' i owe a lot to the genius of @entity4 , and i am forever grateful to have had the chance to work with him			0
' @entity4 has not spoken about @entity3 at all , talking instead about his effusive @entity136 speech that ended with the director jumping up in the air - while @entity3 stood apart from the rest of the group towards the back of the stage			1
serious moment : while @entity3 thanked the film 's producers ' mr @entity77 ' and @entity145 , he did not mention @entity4 at all even though they had been working on the project together since 2008 on the outside : @entity3 stood at the back and did n't interact with any of the other members of the film 's team during their @entity88 acceptance rolling his eyes ? photos show that he was not smiling nor enthused at what is widely considered the night 's biggest award but may have even been making light of the win standing apart : @entity3 physically removed himself from the group ' it 's one of those moments in life that might never happen again but you 're living it , you 're there , and it might never happen again so emotions just take over , ' @entity4 told @entity168			1
as @entity3 mentioned in his speech , he started his @entity171 career by writing for sitcoms including @entity174 's eponymous show and @entity175			0
his first film was the poorly - received @entity178 thriller @entity179 that he co-wrote with director @entity180			0
what a difference : when they won for @entity88 , however , he was literally jumping for joy in 1999 , he wrote @entity34 's film @entity185 , which may explain why he went out of his way to hug his former collaborator on sunday night			2
he then took a thematic turn , writing the 2002 comedy @entity189			0
more recently he co-wrote the @entity192 film @entity193 and then wrote and directed the @entity195 biopic @entity194 which was released at the @entity197 in september and will be on screens more widely this summer			0
@entity3 has told how he and @entity4 started talking about doing a slave - era project together in 2008 and he told @entity200 that it was @entity4 's wife who found the @entity63 story to use as the baseline			1
distancing himself : @entity4 looked as if he was actively trying to avert his eyes so as not to look at @entity3 clear slight : rather than hug anyone related to the film , including star @entity208 of mega producer @entity209 , @entity3 went across the aisle and gave @entity42 hustle director @entity34 a hug walking right past : @entity3 did n't acknowledge @entity102 or producer @entity77 , but only giving @entity77 a mention during his speech when he was on stage ' @entity4 said , " i really wanted to tell a story about that time and place and the slave era in @entity42 but i wanted to have a character that was not obvious in terms of their trade in slavery , someone who had artistic abilities and who had station but found themselves in a different geographical location			1
something that has scope and scale emotionally , " ' according to @entity3			0
' working with @entity4 was difficult only with the geography			0
he lives in @entity234 and i live in @entity49 and in that time period " @entity236 " came together for him and " @entity194 " came together for me but we both thought that this was something worth doing			0
' in addition to taking home three of the biggest @entity11 , 12 years a slave also had a successful night on saturday at the @entity241 winning @entity242 , director , screenplay , supporting female , and @entity246			2
returning the favor : when @entity4 gave a speech as the film won @entity88 , he did not mention @entity3 at all either mixed reactions : @entity3 did not seem happy to greet @entity251 , whose partner @entity77 produced his film , but was much more interested in talking to @entity255 backstage @entity3 was said to have become emotional during his speech and even went so far as to mention @entity4 in his speech at the event , calling the director ' fun '			1
@entity3 went on to give a shout out to @entity261 , who was nominated as a co-writer for before midnight			0
for his part , @entity4 chose to highlight the talents of @entity208 , who has been in every one of his three movies including 12 years a slave - but showed no such love for @entity3 .			2

screenwriter @entity3 said that he did n't mention @entity4 in his @entity270 acceptance speech simply because of time
new sources revealed that @entity4 asked @entity3 to be credited as a co-writer and both @entity3 and the production company said no
tried to keep the feud a *secret* to keep their @entity88 odds strong
@entity4 lashed out at the @entity57 by ordering @entity3 to be seated far away from the ' 12 years ' group and yelled at @entity3 's wife
public displays continued sunday night as @entity4 looked on *sternly* and did an unenthusiastic air clap while @entity3 walked up to the stage
@entity40 - born @entity4 , who is credited as the director and a *co-producer* of ' 12 years ' , received co-writing credits for both of his previous two films
