by @entity0 imagine a home where if you asked your thermostat to change temperature it would , or one that could text your neighbours if an alarm went off while you were on holiday			2
these scenarios are all now a reality after @entity12 - owned thermostat firm @entity11 opened up its software for developers to use for the first time			1
it means that other companies will now be able to take advantage of the smart thermostat ’s software - which can be controlled remotely			2
nest has opened up its software for third - party developers to use for the first time so that companies will now be able to take advantage of the smart thermostat 's ( pictured ) software - which can be controlled remotely @entity11 was formed in 2011 , but earlier this year was purchased by @entity12 for $ 3.2 billion ( £ 1.8 billion )			1
co-founders @entity28 and @entity30 had both previously worked at @entity31 , including on the @entity32 and original @entity33			0
the company has two central products so far - a smart thermostat that can be controlled via a mobile device , and an alarm system that also monitors carbon monoxide levels			1
the announcement confirmed the first partners have linked up with nest to use @entity12 voice recognition and the phrase ‘ @entity45 ’ in order to verbally change temperature on the thermostat			2
@entity30 , vice president of engineering at @entity11 , said : ‘ @entity49 and @entity11 alarm are already helping people save energy , stay comfortable and improve home safety - but that ’s only the beginning			1
the smart @entity57 lights ( pictured left ) were funded by a @entity59 campaign			1
they start at $ 89 ( £ 53 ) each and an individual light can be customised to be any colour on the spectrum using an app ( right )			0
when connected to the @entity11 alarm , the smart light bulbs can be used to warn of carbon monoxide leaks , for example @entity69 presented its vision for a connected home at @entity72 in february , and showed how almost anything in the home can be controlled by a smartphone or linked together electronically			1
from smartlocks and security lights to fridges , all the devices in its conceptual dwelling are sold by individual companies , but all of them run @entity86 software			0
@entity86 is an open source project set up by chipmaker @entity69 in 2011			0
it is a programme that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘ talk ’ to other devices running @entity86			0
the company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further			0
for example , an august smartlock can be linked to lights that flash if they sense an intruder , using the system			0
‘ our goal has always been to bring this kind of thoughtfulness to the rest of your home and life - and that ’s what the @entity111 is all about			0
‘ to kick off the programme , we ’ve worked with iconic brands like @entity115 and @entity116 , as well as new industry leaders like @entity118 and @entity57 , to build seamless , secure and practical ‘ works with nest ’ experiences for the home			1
’ the @entity115 set - up will enable a car to send a message when a driver begins their journey home so the thermostat can start heating or cooling accordingly , in time for their arrival			1
the @entity118 activity monitor wristband communicates with nest to set the temperature as a person wakes up and it can do this because the @entity141 wristband tracks a wearer 's sleep			1
‘ we ’re trying to invent experiences you ’ll use everyday with products that you ’ll use everyday ’ , said @entity30			0
‘ we want to build an experience , not something just for the sake of it			0
’ the @entity115 set - up will enable a car ( pictured ) to send a message when a driver begins their journey home so their thermostat can start heating or cooling accordingly the @entity118 wristband and sleep monitor ( pictured ) communicates with nest to set the temperature as a person wakes up @entity11 said that more than 5,000 developers have already registered an interest in working with the software , including light bulb manufacturer @entity57 , which has developed a system to turn the internal lighting of your home red should the @entity11 carbon monoxide monitor detect a leak			1
@entity176 , founder and chief executive of @entity57 , said : ‘ when we first heard about the @entity111 , we knew we wanted to be a part of it			0
‘ nest brings a whole other dimension to @entity57			2
who would have thought by combining @entity11 products and @entity57 products , we could help save lives ? ’ the launch will further fuel talk of a movement towards the ‘ internet of things ’ - an ever - growing idea that soon all of the devices we use will be connected together , much like computers when using the web			1
technology giant @entity196 has confirmed in the past that the company believes that this trend will be the key development of the next decade in the technology sector , with @entity203 president @entity202 saying he believes the future is all about the ‘ connected home ’			0
chipmaker @entity69 has also unveiled a concept of the connected home where its @entity86 software connects various smart devices from smartlocks and security lights to the fridge and tv			2
@entity86 works in a similar way to @entity214 , by making it possible for smart gadgets from various manufacturers to ' talk ' to each other , however , @entity86 does n't need a single product at its centre to function , like @entity11 does .			2

nest has already partnered with @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity118
the program called ' works with nest ' can be applied to any smart device
@entity115 set - up gets the car to send a message to the home thermostat so it can start heating or cooling in time for a driver 's arrival
@entity11 said that more than 5,000 developers have already registered
they include bulb firm @entity57 that uses lights to warn of carbon monoxide
