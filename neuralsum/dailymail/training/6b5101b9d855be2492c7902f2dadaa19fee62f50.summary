@entity0 could yet remain at @entity1 until at least january after reportedly holding last - ditch talks with manager @entity3 and president @entity4			1
it had been widely expected that the legendary midfield player would leave the @entity8 side this summer and end his playing days with @entity9 in the @entity10			1
one possibility had been that @entity0 would play for @entity13 ’s other sister side , @entity14 , in the @entity15 before the beginning of the new @entity10 season in march			2
he is expected to report for training with @entity1 on thursday			0
it is understood that the 34 - year - old @entity41 , who has won 22 trophies in a glittering career with @entity1 , could still join @entity9 in time for the club ’s first campaign in the mls in 2015			2
if that move materialises , he will link up in the @entity47 with @entity48 , whose move to @entity9 is likely to be finalised in the coming week			2
imminent : @entity48 's move to @entity9 is expected to be confirmed soon @entity48 is expected to spend the next few months in @entity51 with @entity14 , where he is likely to become what is known as the ‘ marquee ’ player			1
under strict regulations , @entity51 clubs are allowed two marquee players , one of which must be @entity51 and the other can be from abroad , who are allowed a wage package that goes beyond the normal salary cap			0
@entity62 , who is spending a short stint in @entity14 before heading stateside , is exempt from the marquee category as he is a ‘ guest ’ player that will qualify to play 10 non-consecutive games for the club			0
confirmed : @entity62 has already joined @entity9 and could link up with @entity48 at @entity14 in the a-league this means that @entity48 and @entity71 could both play for @entity14 until january , along with former @entity72 and @entity73 midifelder @entity74 , whose wage is below the club ’s $ 2.55m salary cap			1
however , @entity14 officials will have to decide between the commercial benefits that the presence of both @entity71 and @entity48 will bring to the club and their chance of winning the league , for it will not be beneficial to lose the two star players in january midway through the season			0
ideally , @entity14 would prefer an international marquee player , therefore , that would remain at the club for the whole season but with the global standing of @entity71 and @entity48 , they are likely to make an exception for this campaign .			0

@entity0 expected to move to @entity10 side @entity9 from @entity1
but *veteran* midfielder could extend stay at @entity34 *temporarily*
@entity48 is expected to sign for @entity9 and @entity62 already has
