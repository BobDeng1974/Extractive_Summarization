@entity0 is insistent that @entity1 will remain @entity3 's chief penalty taker , but he might be wise to revise that stance			1
the head coach came out fighting in defence of @entity1 inside the @entity7 on tuesday night after the 27 - year - old spurned a last - minute opportunity to almost put their tie against @entity11 to bed			1
had he converted , the @entity13 would have taken a two - goal lead to the @entity15 in three weeks			0
@entity16 saves a late penalty from @entity1 in @entity11 's 2 - 1 loss to @entity3 on tuesday four - time world player of the year @entity1 has now missed four of his last seven penalties for @entity3 @entity1 's shot was the perfect height for the @entity24 keeper but boss @entity0 backed his forward but @entity1 's struggles from 12 yards continued as @entity16 saved his spot - kick before the forward nodded wide the rebound			1
remarkably , he has somehow managed to miss four of his last seven penalties for @entity3 ; that dismal record stands at five misses from 10 for club and country			2
only @entity35 ( five ) and @entity36 ( four ) have failed to score on more occasions from penalties in @entity40 's premier club competition			0
@entity0 , however , is unwavering in his support for @entity1			2
' those who miss penalties are those who dare to take them and our penalty taker is undoubtedly @entity1 , ' he said			2
@entity1 misses a header from the rebound in an incident which gives @entity11 hope the @entity51 no 10 was outstanding at the @entity7 but missed an open goal and the chance to make it 3 - 1 @entity1 missed in the @entity57 semi-final aggregate defeat against @entity58 in 2012 ' we have the utmost confidence in his capacity to take them			1
' comparisons with @entity64 are never far away , with the @entity65 scoring 54 of his 59 penalties for @entity68			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , has netted 46 from the same number			0
@entity70 was buoyant in the immediate aftermath , claiming @entity11 remain in the last - 16 tie because of @entity16 's heroics			1
' it was a very important save , ' said @entity70			0
' it would have been very difficult at 3 - 1			1
' it is not the best result to lose at home , but we will go to @entity3 to try to win			0
we still have the chance to do it			0
