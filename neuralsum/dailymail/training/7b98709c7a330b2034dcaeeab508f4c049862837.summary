first there was the selfie *phenomenon* and now there is the ' selfie stick '
the metal sticks or monopods range between **$** *35* and **$** *90* in @entity177
despite *hundreds* of people carrying around the three - foot sticks lots of people still can not take the perfect photo
they end up with half the ' selfie stick ' in their photo
the trend is being particularly seen in the @entity141 and @entity65
