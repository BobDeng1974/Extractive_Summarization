major airport hubs from @entity15 to @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 can expect to be affected by some extreme or another through monday			0
conditions will begin to calm down by the time the holiday finally rolls around wednesday , with only parts of the northern @entity7 expecting a white @entity9 this year			0
soaked : a @entity23 and some @entity24 walk through @entity25 as @entity26 got a rare downpour thursday			0
a different storm system is set to disrupt holiday travel starting saturday as the @entity30 prepares for severe rain and even tornadoes @entity33 : @entity34 slowed to a crawl in @entity36 thursday as snow swept the area causing power outages and car accidents			1
as the weekend wears on , most of the snow will be focused in the northern @entity7 states , where roads could be dangerous as holiday travelers prepare for @entity9 heading to the islands ? even balmy @entity47 gets snow at its highest peaks , pictured here is the summit of @entity52 on the @entity47 of @entity47 on friday , snow will be the first sign of @entity9 travel trouble as it ekes its way in from the @entity57			1
into friday night , much of the @entity58 and into southern @entity59 and @entity60 will begin to see snow accumulate as much as 6 inches			2
into saturday , a warm front will fuel rains from @entity64 , though much of the @entity30 and north through @entity65 and into @entity66			2
travel could get especially nasty in east @entity64 , @entity68 and north to the southern tip of @entity70 , where severe thunderstorms are expected			2
drenched : it wo n't be as unusual as it is in @entity73 ( pictured ) , but folks from @entity64 to southern @entity70 can expect exceedingly wet conditions through the weekend dangerous : millions of travelers are hitting the roads and skies this weekend			2
but saturday , the weather calls fro dangerous thunderstorms in much of the @entity13 , with potential for tornadoes in some areas mixed bag : the outlook is good and bad on friday , when travelers in the @entity87 and @entity30 can expect good conditions , while the north and @entity90 have a tough road ahead @entity33 : a band of snow can be expected from @entity94 to @entity95 on friday , with more to come towards @entity9 itself frigid : wet snow falls in @entity36 on thursday when a winter storm battered northern @entity99 causign power outages , traffic accidents , and the temporary shutdown of the @entity36 airport nasty : much of the @entity58 can expect the same as @entity36 ( pictured ) into the weekend , threatening to interrupt holiday travel plans a winter storm blasted the @entity107 resulting in numbers crashes including these two cars that collided during the treacherous drive in @entity36 on thursday brave : a cyclist pedals across @entity113 during a snowstorm in @entity36 on thursday as winter storm blasted @entity99 's @entity107 there is even potential for tornadoes in those areas through saturday night			1
even where tornado warnings are unlikely , the @entity30 and much of the @entity7 can expect to be drenched into sunday			0
the @entity122 can expect an unseasonably warm weekend with temperatures reaching the 60s			1
remnants of the massive storm due to soak the center of the country will creep east and cause some rain closer to the coasts late in the weekend			0
the warm temperatures will melt away any @entity122 snow left over from @entity133 , such as in @entity19 where residents spent the weekend blocking parking spaces they 'd spent hours shoveling with things like trash bins , lawn chairs and vacuum cleaners			1
however , snow is in the forecast into the holiday week for much of @entity94 and in parts of @entity143 , @entity70 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
@entity9 for some : as the east feels the last of the storm 's rain into wednesday , much of @entity94 and the @entity58 will see a white @entity9 along with @entity150 and @entity151 not the greatest : travel will be better in the @entity7 by monday , conditions will remain poor on the @entity122 and @entity154 i called it : every winter , following a snow storm , the tradition of marking the parking space that one has shoveled with a disposable object continues in @entity19 neighborhoods			1
this most recent storm 's snow will melt into the weekend as unseasonably warm weather moves across the @entity122 @entity166 : a chair , spray painted with the home address number is left in a shoveled parking space on a public street in the @entity19 neighborhood enjoy it while you can : an old vacuum is left in a shoveled parking space in the @entity19 neighborhood			1
rains will gradually replace the dry , warmth the @entity122 can expect for the weekend bad reception : an old television set marks another parking spot in @entity19			0
arguments sometimes result over cleared public parking spaces including the arrest of a 32 - year - old man in the alleged assault of a 66 - year - old neighbor after the last snowfall			0

severe thunderstorms will hit a chunk of the southern @entity192 along with the threat of tornadoes just as millions of travelers take to the roads and air for holiday travel this weekend

the *northernmost* stretches of the @entity7 , the @entity58 and much of @entity60 will receive a *liberal* *dumping* of snow friday
