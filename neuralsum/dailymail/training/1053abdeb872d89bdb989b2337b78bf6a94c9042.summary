by @entity0 an artist decided to put familial resemblance to the test by taking a half of a person 's face and merging it with their brother , sister , mother , daughter , or best friend to see just how similar their features are when paired together			1
@entity16 artist @entity15 , 27 , exhibits his images in the series entitled , @entity19 , and says he did so to explore the , ' similarities and differences between people that are connected genetically or with relationship			1
' by using @entity25 to blend the two faces into one , @entity15 is able to create faces that look they belong to one person but upon further glance are noticeably two people			1
the @entity51 reports that in order to take the photograph , he used similar lighting and when blending the snapshots he duplicated the hair and clothing of his subjects to make them appear uniform			1
at first glance , the photos look like they might be of one person			1
however the artist says that , â€˜ when you look at it a bit closer you see something different and strange			2
' in the photo of a brother and sister it almost appears as if the photographic subject is lifting his eyebrow when in reality , the arched brow is the more feminine feature characteristic of the man 's sister			0
peas in a pod : the photo on the left is of identical twin sisters while the one on the right is of best friends though they both look very similar , begging the question of whether or not non-familial relationships might be based on similar genetics in a merge of a brother and sister who are still children , the face is indistinguishable			2
a photo of twin sisters looks the most alike out of all the images but is due to the fact that the twins have the most similar genetic makeup			2
the photo of best friends shows that even though people may not be genetically related they are drawn to one another as friends due to their genetic similarities			0
the eyes of the merged best friend image are different colors but the ears , eyebrows , and jawline are almost identical			0
a very interesting merge between a mother and daughter show similar features that have been changed by age			0
according to his @entity115 website , @entity113 studied as an undergraduate studying @entity117 at faculty of science in 2010 and was later accepted to the @entity119 for photography and cinematography			0
sisters and brothers : the photo on the left is of two sisters and the photo on the right is of two brothers and while they look similar the placement of their eyes gives the secret that they are two people away mother and daughter : perhaps the most noticeable difference between faces is that of a mother and a daughter who have similar features but still appear different because of their age			0
