these pictures of @entity2 students standing in huge lines despite the minus two degrees centigrade temperature is the reason there are growing calls for action to sort out the chronic shortage of library places			1
these pictures were taken recently ahead of final exams at @entity13 in @entity14 , the capital of eastern @entity2 's @entity15			1
the queues had already started forming hours before the library officially opened at 8am , regardless of the frost on the ground			1
long wait : @entity2 students standing in huge lines despite minus two degrees centigrade to enter the library at @entity13 @entity22 : @entity2 students have complained that universities are n't doing enough to provide them with an adequate number of study spaces officials said they had even opened half an hour earlier to try and meet the demand , but there had still been huge queues , with some waiting over an hour to get in			1
it is the reason why students want the government to put up more cash for library places			2
they complained that the universities themselves have been doing little to solve the problem and instead have been cashing in on the desperation of students to get the opportunity to study in the library shortly before exams , by reserving desks and charging students for the access			1
@entity48 spokesman @entity47 said : ' students want to work hard but standing for hours to get a study place is a waste of everyone 's time			2
' @entity2 children are taught from an early age to work hard and study if they are to be a success			1
but students say that making them wait for hours in the cold does not achieve anything and are urging more money for study facilities			2
they singled out the privatisation of library places recently at the @entity64 in the city of @entity66 as an example of bad practice			0
capitalist venture : one university has started renting out private cubicles to students willing to pay their way to peace and quiet @entity48 spokesman @entity47 said ' students want to work hard but standing for hours to get a study place is a waste of everyone 's time ' officials at the university said they had even opened half an hour earlier to try and meet the demand , but there had still been huge queues in another step away from its communist past , the university had converted several floors of its library to make private study rooms for the wealthy few			1
students that sign up to pay a yearly fee get their own cubicle allowing them to bypass the rest of their student colleagues standing in queues outside for a place at a table			0
the university even admitted it was a way of getting money , but those who failed to get a place in a cubicle have complained that there are now even less spaces available for the rest of them			0
one , @entity110 , said : ' a library belongs to all students , the booths are a good service but only for a small number of students , and for the majority of us who ca n't have such a booth , our public study space is reduced by the booths			0
' one student who failed to get a booth said : ' everyday i have to get up early and line up to grab a seat , and sometimes i still ca n't successfully get a seat , but those 169 students are treated as vips in the library			0
a university should not be a two tier society			0
and a university library should not be run like a profit - making organisation with students treated unequally based on money			1
' the university revealed that there were 169 one - square - metre rooms that had all sold out in the first day , mostly by senior students preparing for postgraduate and civil service exams			2
spokesman @entity142 said : ' a good study atmosphere is important for students who are preparing for important exams			0
to save students the troubles of getting up early to grab a seat in the library and provide them a better place to study , the cubicles were set up			0
' but as well as complaints from those who lost out , students who managed to get booths also complained that they could only be used by the student who took out the lease , and that the booths can not be sub-let or shared with friends .			0
