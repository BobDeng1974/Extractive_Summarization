@entity1 's emphatic support for @entity3 's unsuccessful independence movement may have had a detrimental impact on tourism there , at least in the short term			1
as interest from potential visitors significantly rose in the country 's other major cities following the surprisingly comfortable referendum margin in favour of pro-union voters , the same can not be said for @entity3 's most populous city which was strongly in favour of leaving the @entity17			1
travel interest for @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 increased markedly on friday compared to the previous friday , when @entity3 's future remained uncertain and polls predicted a tight vote			1
conversely , site searches for accommodation in @entity1 increased by just two per cent from the friday before			0
' this is hardly surprising considering the strength of the " yes " vote there , ' said @entity31 's @entity39			0
' perhaps it will take a little longer for travellers to feel comfortable visiting @entity1 again			0
' in the week leading up to the vote interest on the site for @entity3 as a tourist destination had plummeted by 29 per cent year - on - year as travellers awaited the outcome of the referendum			1
' this definitely indicates an increase in travel interest from the rest of the @entity17 to @entity3 , ' @entity48 said			2
' hopefully this indicates a return to normality for @entity3 tourism , as it would be a shame for the country to suffer and unfortunate for visitors to miss out on everything @entity3 has to offer			0
' high on the hill : searches for @entity20 have risen 27 per cent on the website @entity31 last week on the up : castlegate in the city centre of @entity21 , for which accommodation searches have risen 10 % before the referendum there were reports of visitors from outside @entity3 cancelling holidays due to the perception of anti-english feeling in the country			1
but when asked if the ' no ' vote would have any impact , positive or negative , on visitors choosing to go to @entity3 from south of the border @entity77 's spokeswoman gave a simple : ' no '			2
' we are not aware of cancellations - people come to @entity3 because of the friendly people , the landscapes , cities and amazing events and will continue to do so , ' the spokeswoman said			0
with the referendum over , @entity3 tourism can now focus on the @entity93 golf tournament between @entity94 and the @entity95 set for @entity96 in @entity97 .			0

interest has *skyrocketed* for @entity3 's @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity19
but tourists are *n't* anywhere near as keen on @entity1 for a holiday
@entity3 's *biggest* city emphatically voted yes for independence
