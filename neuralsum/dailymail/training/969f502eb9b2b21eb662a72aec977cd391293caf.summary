claims that large numbers of @entity2 were attacked in the aftermath of the @entity5 murder were questioned yesterday			1
a government - funded project warned it had received more than 200 reports of @entity9 following drummer @entity11 ’s murder , including attacks on mosques and @entity2 women			1
project director @entity15 said the figure represented a ‘ substantial spike ’ in hate crimes and warned of ‘ a sustained wave of attacks and intimidation ’ against @entity2 communities across @entity21			2
two men , both reportedly soldiers , have been arrested in connection with a petrol bomb attack on the @entity27 since the killing of @entity11 but more than half of the incidents reported to the @entity32 ( measuring anti-muslim attacks ) hotline related to offensive messages on @entity35 , @entity36 or online blogs , and only a tiny minority were physical attacks , it has emerged			1
the claims raised questions about the way @entity43 presented its figures in the days after @entity11 ’s murder , amid repeated calls for calm to avoid reprisal attacks			1
mr @entity15 said tell @entity49 had received 162 reports of @entity52 prejudice in a 48 - hour period			0
between four and eight incidents are normally reported daily to the charity , which receives £ 214,000 a year in funding from the @entity57 to provide data and reports on attacks against @entity2 to combat hate crime			1
a total of 212 incidents were reported between the @entity5 murder on may 22 and the end of last week			1
the attacks received widespread coverage alongside warnings from mr @entity15 of a ‘ cycle of violence ’ against @entity2 which had led to ‘ a sense of endemic fear ’			0
but while they included a petrol bomb attack on a mosque in @entity27 and in another incident in @entity78 where a man entered a mosque armed with a knife , only 17 cases involved individuals being physically targeted , a sunday newspaper reported			2
@entity82 : charities said there had been a ' substantial spike ' in hate crimes against @entity2 since the @entity5 killing			0
this @entity89 mosque was vandalised on the evening of @entity11 's death criminal damage : this mosque in @entity93 , @entity94 , was the target of vandals on the night after @entity11 's death			0
but figures show a tiny minority of reported incidents were physical attacks six people had things thrown at them and most of the other 11 incidents related to attempts to rip off women ’s headscarves or other items of @entity109 dress			1
more than half – 120 – related to offensive or abusive messages on social networking sites including @entity36 and @entity35			2
contacted by the @entity112 , mr @entity15 refused to discuss the figures , which he said would be independently checked by @entity114 for a report next month			2
any attempt to downplay the significance of verbal or online abuse was ‘ an affront to hate crime reporting ’ , he said			0
he was also challenged on the figures during an interview on @entity124 ’s sunday programme , when he conceded that the number of physical attacks was ‘ quite small ’			0
tensions : although there have been angry booze - fuelled @entity131 marches since @entity11 's death , figures show most reported @entity52 ' attacks ' have been comments on the internet he said : ‘ we are talking mainly about generalised abuse , targeted comments said at a street level as well as targeted comments online			1
‘ so most of it is generalised abuse , thankfully it is not extreme violence			0
‘ this is not just an issue of attacks , physical attacks against individuals , this is about looking at the whole picture			0
’ in a statement on the @entity43 website , the project said verbal and online abuse were ‘ recordable hate incidents ’ along with violent assaults and attacks on mosques			1
