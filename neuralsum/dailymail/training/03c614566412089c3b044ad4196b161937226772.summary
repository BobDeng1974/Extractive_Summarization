by @entity0 published : 02:55 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 1 march 2013 taxpayer - owned shares in @entity2 are close to being sold off by the government , but at a far lower level than first thought , it emerged today			1
@entity7 is understood to have told the bank 's board that when the price hits 61p , 7p more than its current level when the @entity12 opened today , they will be cashed in			1
but it had been understood that the @entity15 would not sell until they hit around 74p - the average price they paid five years ago			2
@entity2 is 39 per cent publicly - owned by after the government was forced to step in to bail - out the bank with £ 5bn at the height of the financial crisis in 2008			1
but despite this hit , boss @entity28 has been awarded a £ 1.5 million shares bonus while staff will share a £ 365 million total pot. this is despite further losses in the wake of mammoth provisions for mis - selling claims			1
the taxpayer - backed bank remained in the red in 2012 after setting aside £ 3.6billion for compensation relating to the payment protection insurance ( @entity42 ) scandal and £ 400 million for the mis - selling of interest rate swaps to small businesses			0
@entity2 said mr @entity28 's bonus has been deferred for five years and will only be paid out if shares reach and remain at 73.6p for a sustained period , or if the government is able to sell at least a third of its stake at a profit			1
staff will share out a £ 365 million bonus pool , down 3 per cent on 2011 , giving each employee around £ 3,900 on average			1
cash bonuses have been capped at £ 2,000			0
mr @entity28 insisted the group ’s sale of more than 600 branches to the @entity62 remained on track in spite of reports earlier this week that the co-op is battling to plug a potential £ 1 billion capital hole discovered by the @entity68			2
he said the co-op remained “ absolutely committed to this deal ” and confirmed @entity2 will be separating the branches under the tsb brand on the high street by august in preparation to be offloaded			0
@entity2 said losses narrowed significantly from £ 3.5 billion a year earlier thanks to improvements in its core business			2
but much of this was down to cost - cutting , as income fell 13 per cent amid historic low interest rates			0
@entity2 said it was very close to its original target to bring costs down to around £ 10 billion and was now hoping to cut costs even further , to £ 9.8 billion , in 2013			0
the group added that it boosted lending to small business by 4 per cent on a net basis and helped 55,000 customers buy their first home .			0

@entity7 will sell when shares hit 61 - around 7p above current level
@entity2 lost £ 570m last year , down from £ 3.5bn in 2011
but boss @entity28 will still get £ 1.5m , and staff share £ 365m
