now one businessman in @entity6 is offering what is , arguably , the must - stay experience for any self - respecting @entity10 fan			1
a narrowboat has been converted into a floating hotel - and painted to look like the @entity13 on the cover of the @entity4 's iconic album			1
the 80 - ft vessel - turned hotel is moored at @entity6 's @entity18 and is the brainchild of eccentric businessman @entity20			1
all aboard : the @entity13 hotel boat is the work of eccentric businessman @entity20 far out : the psychedelic interiors of the boat also feature a scooter from the film quadrophenia in the lounge featuring more than a few mod - cons , an original scooter from the film @entity26 sits in the psychedelic lounge , while the three bedrooms - boasting decor inspired by the 1969 album - all come fitted with 3d televisions , computers and wi - fi			1
mr @entity20 admitted seeking out all the fixtures and fittings for the refurbishment - which took nine months - had been a ' massive job '			1
the boat was previously owned by @entity43 and used in their thriller @entity46 for the @entity47 , starring @entity48 , which was partly filmed in @entity6 waters			0
mr @entity20 , who also runs @entity51 , hopes to complete a fleet of floating hotels he will design himself - including @entity54 and @entity56 vessels			1
i 'm only sleeping : the refurbishment took nine months and mr @entity20 admitted finding all the fixtures and fittings had been a ' massive job ' left : the cover of the soundtrack album to @entity13 and ( right ) the band in their psychedelic period around the time of its recording he added : ' it will all be from my crazy head ! ' the former freight company owner came up with the idea of a floating hotel last year and his first @entity75 - themed moat - tel has been a huge success			1
the 53 year - old has been buoyed by the popularity of the @entity79 theme and bookings have been taken from @entity81 , the @entity82 , @entity83 and the @entity84 until october			2
rooms are priced at £ 149 per night , from monday to thursday , and £ 299 and £ 350 from friday to sunday			0
fit for the @entity4 : the boat also features a fully - furnished kitchen and dining area when i get home : the boat was previously owned by @entity43 and used in their thriller @entity46 for the @entity47 psychedelic : an image from the film the @entity10 always denied the song @entity13 had any hidden meaning or referred to drugs			1
@entity100 who wrote it , said at the time of its release : ' it 's a fun song , a children 's song			2
' originally we intended it to be ' @entity109 ' a children 's record			2
but now it 's the idea of a yellow submarine where all the kids went to have fun			2
' i was just going to sleep one night and thinking if we had a children 's song , it would be nice to be on a yellow submarine where all your friends are with a band			0
' however many music fans believe the song is really a reference to the mind - bending hallucinogenic drug lsd			0
it was written at the height of the @entity10 psychedelic period , when they were known to be experimenting with the drug			0
in the 60s a variety of @entity126 sold in pill form , was reportedly known as ' yellow submarines '			0
analysing the lyrics , the ' man that sailed the shore ' reportedly refers to a drug dealer , while the line ' our friends are all aboard ' , supposedly meant their friends were doing drugs too			0
the film itself is awash with colourful psychedelic - style images , weird and whacky characters			0
the villains of the story are the ' @entity151 ' , who are supposed to represent the police			0
