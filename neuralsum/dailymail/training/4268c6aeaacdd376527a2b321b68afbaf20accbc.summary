big - oil backed @entity1 researchers are advertising for a hardy soul to work for them as a polar bear spotter in @entity6 , in a move panned by environmental campaigners as an attempt at ' greenwash '			1
the @entity10 wants somebody to count the numbers of polar bears in the 20 to 25 different groups living around the ice - bound @entity15			2
the project is a joint venture between @entity21 state - owned oil company @entity19 and @entity22 , the @entity23 multinational oil and gas corporation , to exploit fossil fuels locked beneath the @entity1 ice			1
count me out ... @entity1 researchers backed by big - oil firms @entity22 and @entity19 are advertising for an individual or team to count polar bears in the @entity15 , in a move green campaigners have panned as ' ironic ' for now , their research is concentrating around the sea off @entity6 's frozen north - west coast			1
well north of the @entity37 , it is covered by more than a metre of ice for most of the year			0
the job advertised by @entity19 and @entity22 is part of a $ 3.2billion exploration programme to work out how best to exploit the @entity1 's natural resources			1
surveys carried out by energy giants have shown that 6.2billion tons of oil and 14.6billion cubic metres of natural gas lie locked beneath the floor of the @entity15 alone			1
as well as counting bears , the person who wins the post will also be expected to place electronic monitoring collars on up to 20 adult females			2
they also need to take blood samples from the bears so that laboratory tests can be carried out later			0
but only the brave and resilient need apply			0
polar bears are one of the few mammals that will deliberately hunt humans for food			2
good eyesight is a must to spot the white bears against the icy background			0
winter temperatures in the area plunge to minus 46 ห ะก			0
but although it includes working with animals for a species officially classified as ' vulnerable ' , the work may not suit conservationists			0
@entity74 , the head of @entity76 's @entity1 campaign , called @entity22 and @entity19 's @entity1 research project ' obvious greenwash '			1
he said that their plan to hire a polar bear counter was ' ironic ' given that the companies plan to drill in areas recognised as protected sites for the species			1
' if you look at the deal struck by @entity19 and @entity22 the drilling blocks actually impinge on protected areas , ' said mr @entity74			1
' in the @entity15 the blocks that they will be drilling impinge on a supposedly protected @entity21 national park , an area that 's supposed to be sacrosanct			0
' in other regions they hope to drill later , one of the places - @entity99 - is actually a @entity100 where polar bears breed			1
' so it 's ironic that they are advertising for polar bear spotters when they are actually planning to drill in the nursery for polar bears in the @entity1			1
' mr @entity74 added : ' the clear motive is a very thin veneer of green respectability on probably the most reckless drilling operation anywhere in the world			0
' [ @entity22 ] is the company responsible for the @entity115 disaster , which it was the 25th anniversary of just yesterday			1
' the aftermath of the @entity115 disaster 25 years ago : if a similar incident was to happen in the remote and inaccessible waters of the @entity15 , it would make that spill ' look like a picnic ' , said a @entity76 spokesman in that incident an @entity125 - owned oil tanker bound for @entity126 , @entity127 , struck a reef off @entity129 , @entity130 , and bled as much as 750,000 barrels of crude oil into the @entity133 in just a few days			2
due to the inaccessibility of the region hampering clean - up efforts , the oil eventually covered 1,300 miles of coastline , and 11,000 square miles of ocean , blighting a crucial habitat for salmon , sea otters , seals and seabirds			0
' if a spill happened up in the @entity15 it would make the @entity115 look like a picnic , ' mr @entity74 said			0
so remote is the @entity15 that its ecosystem is still relatively clean compared to oceans in lower latitudes , but the @entity152 identifies overfishing and oil and gas development as severe threats			2
in the @entity158 era , it was also long a dumping ground for military and civilian nuclear waste			0
the successful applicant will be chosen at the end of march , so the applications need to be sent soon			0
@entity164 contacted @entity22 for comment , but had received no reply at the time of publication .			2

project is joint venture between oil companies @entity19 and @entity22
they hope to exploit vast oil and gas *reserves* locked beneath the @entity1
@entity180 campaigners dismiss polar bear counting job as ' obvious greenwash '
