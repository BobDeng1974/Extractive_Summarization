one lady had paid £ 30,000 for two corner sofas , he recalls			2
@entity45 heading off to do a valuation she got bored with them after six months , put them into storage costing £ 1,000 a month for three years - by which time they 'd cost her £ 66,000 - and was delighted when they fetched £ 1,500 each at auction			1
' we 're lucky here because the vendors are n't selling because they 're skint			0
we get lots of celebrities ... they do n't want to sell on @entity65 or have strangers coming to their house - this is a lot more anonymous			2
' @entity45 points to a nondescript leather armchair and footstool			0
