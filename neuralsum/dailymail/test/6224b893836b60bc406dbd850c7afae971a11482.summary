@entity0 moved further clear of the two @entity2 clubs in second place , and kept the pressure up on leaders @entity6 , as they held on to beat a spirited @entity7 at @entity8			1
@entity10 's side were far from their best , but @entity12 's early goal put them ahead and @entity7 , for all their endeavour , did n't create too many clear - cut chances			1
here 's how @entity16 rated each player ... @entity7 @entity18 : saved well from @entity19 in the build - up to @entity0 ’s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear			1
7 @entity23 : forced @entity24 into a good save with a curling free - kick and delivered well from corners			0
6 @entity27 : at fault for @entity0 ’s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply			2
5.5 @entity32 : the 37 - year - old did a good job of keeping @entity35 under wraps and provided a threat from corners			0
6.5 @entity39 : made a superb block to deny @entity12 a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from @entity19			1
7 @entity39 was booked in the first half for a blatant block on @entity12 , but responded well @entity32 goes up to challenge @entity0 's in - form striker @entity35 during the hard - fought encounter @entity47 : full of running as ever but failed to trouble @entity0 when in possession of the ball			1
6 @entity52 : another full of industry and almost provided an assist for @entity55 with a clever lob			0
6 @entity57 : brought calmness and quality to @entity7 ’s midfield but could not find a killer pass			2
6.5 @entity62 : wide left is not his favoured position but put @entity66 under pressure with and intense work ethic			0
6 @entity55 : starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from @entity52 ’s chip into the box			0
6 @entity73 : saw an early chance go begging when he fired at @entity24 from close range			0
6 subs : @entity78 ( for @entity57 ) 90 @entity47 , who missed a great chance for @entity7 on the half - volley , tackles @entity81 @entity52 tries to get to grips with @entity19 as @entity7 worked exceptionally hard against @entity0 @entity0 @entity83 : was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny @entity85 and @entity23			1
7 @entity66 : faded after a bright start			0
pinned back by @entity62 ’ aggressive closing down			0
6 @entity89 : kept a close eye on @entity55 and restricted the @entity7 top - scorer to just one chance			2
7 per mertesacker : given a good , physical battle by @entity94 and just about came out on top			0
7 @entity66 is chopped down by @entity62 as @entity7 targeted the young @entity97 full back @entity89 suffered a few difficult moments as @entity0 sought to continue their excellent form @entity100 : made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for @entity55			1
6 @entity81 : has developed into a key member of @entity0 ’s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 @entity19 : less effective than he was against @entity108 , with only flashes of brilliance			1
6 @entity12 : @entity111 the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the @entity114 noses in front			0
6.5 @entity12 fires home to put @entity0 ahead despite several @entity7 defenders ' best efforts @entity119 : left his shooting boots in north @entity121			1
the @entity122 whipped a free - kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left - foot volley over the bar			0
6 @entity126 : saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but @entity7 coped well to nullify the @entity131 ’s threat			2
6 @entity35 : marked out of the game by @entity7 ’s centre - backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced			2
5 subs : @entity136 for @entity35 ( 81 ) , @entity137 ( 90 ) referee : @entity139 6.5 @entity126 appeals for a free kick in a game where @entity7 's tough tackling caused him some problems @entity35 holds the ball up , but could n't add to his six - game goalscoring run at @entity8			1

@entity81 superb in *protecting* @entity0 back four at @entity8
@entity18 does well in goal for hosts , but @entity0 keep winning
@entity39 puts in excellent *display* at full back for @entity7 despite loss
