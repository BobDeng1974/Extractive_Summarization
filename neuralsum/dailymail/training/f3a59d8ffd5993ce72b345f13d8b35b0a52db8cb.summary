a new study says that global industrial civilization may collapse in mere decades due to unequal wealth distribution and increased strain on the planet 's resources			1
the report , funded by @entity8 's @entity7 , investigates factors which may be most closely linked to civilizations ' downfalls , including @entity12 , @entity13 reports			2
together , these factors can create resource strain and a wide gap between rich and poor			1
increased strain on resources and widening gap between rich and poor may lead to industrial civilization 's collapse , the study warns in one scenario , a famine among ' @entity23 ' eventually causes the collapse of society , due to a loss of workers the study , led by mathematician @entity30 , goes on to say the the rich , or ' elites , ' may be responsible for both problems , the @entity13 notes			1
' ... accumulated surplus is not evenly distributed throughout society , but rather has been controlled by an elite , ' it says			0
' the mass of the population , while producing the wealth , is only allocated a small portion of it by elites , usually at or just above subsistence levels			2
' furthermore , technology also ' tends to raise both per capita resource consumption and the scale of resource extraction			0
' it also cites the downfall of other major , highly advanced civilizations , including the @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and various @entity56 empires as evidence that they can be ' fragile and impermanent			0
' in both scenarios the study says that @entity23 would collapse first , later followed by the wealthy elites would societal collapse mean a doomsday scenarios like the one portrayed in ' @entity64 ? ' ( pictured ) the study then lists a series of doomsday scenarios			1
in the first , the @entity61 ' grow and consume too much , resulting in a famine among @entity23 that eventually causes the collapse of society			2
[ @entity71 ] is due to a loss of workers , rather than a collapse of @entity75			0
' in the second , ' the decline of the @entity23 occurs faster , while the @entity61 are still thriving			0
[ eventually ] the @entity23 collapse completely , followed by the @entity61			1
' because of a buffer zone due to their wealth , @entity61 may continue ' " business as usual " despite the impending catastrophe			0
' the study then goes on to say that in order to avoid societal collapse , the wealth gap must be greatly reduced and population must be controlled .			1

collapse of civilization may be linked to increased strain on planet 's resources and wide gap between the rich and the poor
study says rich ' elites ' may be responsible for both problems
in both doomsday scenarios *predicted* by study , poor ' @entity23 ' collapse first , later followed by the elites
to avoid collapse *inequality* must be reduced and population growth must be *strictly* controlled , it says
