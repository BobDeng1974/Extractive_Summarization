those in managerial or professional roles are 60 per cent more likely to describe themselves as gay , lesbian or bisexual compared to those in traditionally working - class jobs , a study found			2
an @entity4 survey shows people in professional roles are more likely to be openly gay ( file picture ) the @entity4 's @entity21 found that , overall , 1.6 per cent of people in the @entity23 said they were gay , but pollsters believe the figure is likely to be higher as many people refused to reveal their sexuality			1
more than two per cent of those in middle class positions said they were gay , lesbian or bisexual , compared to 1.4 per cent in manual labour jobs			2
the survey also showed large differences between @entity23 's regions , with just 1.1 per cent of people in the @entity35 describing themselves as gay , compared to 3.2 per cent in @entity37			1

@entity57 say the figures may be unreliable due to those answering the survey being unwilling to reveal their or their housemates sexuality to those asking the questions .			0
