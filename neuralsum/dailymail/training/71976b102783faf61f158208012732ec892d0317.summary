by @entity0 one in four office workers keep an eye on their emails as they eat , according to a new study by @entity5 half of office workers now eat lunch at their desks and one in four keep an eye on their emails as they eat , according to a new study			1
researchers also found office workers spend an average of just 15 minutes eating their lunch with 15.8million workers failing to take a full lunch hour			1
the poll , by @entity19 to launch its £ 1 lunch , found the most commonly stated excuse for workers failing to take a proper lunch break was being ‘ too busy ’ - with one in six people even feeling guilty about leaving their desk			1
it also found that time pressures are not the only thing stopping people from enjoying a lunch break			2
more than a third said the cost of food was the biggest factor affecting their decision of what to buy for lunch and more than one in four workers opt to take a packed lunch to work to save cash , according to the research			1
in what is perhaps a reflection of ever - busier lives , the lunch break is increasingly used as admin time for workers ’ personal lives			2
the most common admin tasks performed by workers during their lunch break are internet banking ( 40 per cent ) , personal phone calls ( 39 per cent ) , booking appointments ( 29 per cent ) , shopping online ( 28 per cent ) and paying bills ( 21 per cent )			0

food psychologist doctor @entity58 said workers who eat at their desks could be in danger of not switching off from their work ( file picture ) she said : ‘ it ’s clear that most of us are eating too fast , and all - too - often we ’re distracted by other tasks while eating so we do n’t take time to notice and appreciate our food			0
‘ there ’s a danger that this could lead to overeating - but it also means that our mind is constantly working so we do n’t ever switch off to focus on the food itself			0
‘ a lunch break is a time to re-fuel , but it should also give us some breathing space from work			0
