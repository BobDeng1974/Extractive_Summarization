it 's hard to believe that a little girl in pigtails , who 's only in her first year of school , could possibly be the best six - year - old surfer and skater in the world			1
she goes by the name of ' the flying squirrel ' and she 's only been surfing for 18 months			1
so there 's no disputing that @entity10 has certainly defied the odds from her birth up until now , proving that age is no barrier when it comes to excelling at your ultimate passions in life			1
' she had no idea what surfing was but she just wanted to hang out with her daddy , ' mother @entity37 said			2
when @entity41 was born , she was kept in the @entity42 for three weeks ' she had n't swum in the ocean much or was n't exposed to the water that much as she lived near a farm but she really does n't like missing out on things			1
' after her first wave , she was addicted			2
' mrs @entity37 witnessed the change in her daughter that very moment she jumped on her surfboard			0
' i was freaking out but she looked so excited but once she got on that board there was something about her that changed , ' she said			0
' her mindset is different and she 's not afraid of the ocean			0
she seems so calm and complete when she 's out there			0
' i know the risks involved but it 's where she wants to be so i would n’t stop her from that			0
' two months later , @entity41 's parents decided that when the ocean was too rough for their little one she would have to find another alternative			1
that 's when her other love for skating began			2
' she keeps saying that she wants to be a pro surfer and skater when she grows up and she loves the two sports equally so she would n't be able to choose between the two , ' mrs @entity37 said			1
' i think it 's awesome			0
it 's such an adventure we 're on and it feels as though she 's the one who 's taking us for a ride			0
' but the journey has n't been without its complications			0
@entity41 has big dreams with hopes of becoming both a pro surfer and skater when she grows up the six - year - old started skating two months after she started surfing at the age of four @entity41 working on some new tricks with fellow skaters at birth , @entity41 suffered from adrenal insufficiency which left her in the @entity42 for three weeks			1
she was diagnosed with @entity92 which means she is steroid dependent			1
since then , the fearless little girl has been taking cortisone medication three times a day			0
' if someone told me five years ago that i 'd be where i 'm at now i would 've laughed , ’ mrs @entity37 said			0
' @entity41 blows my mind			2
i do n't know how she does it at her age and how she can be so focused and driven			2
' but i think when you find your passion nothing can hold you back			0
not even @entity41 's condition or her age and you could see that when she was out in the water			1
' so much so , the six - year - old has already signed on multiple surfing sponsors and gained a huge following on social media			1
her coach @entity114 says she has a lot of potential and could possibly be the world 's best surfer and skater in her age group			1
' she has incredible balance and her ability to judge the conditions and adjust is at a level i 've never seen in someone her age , ' he told the @entity129			2
@entity41 's love for surfing began when she decided that she wanted to follow her father out for a surf during a holiday in the @entity35 , southeastern @entity136 the flying squirrel is in her first year at school but sometimes wishes she was out in the water when there 's a big swell but the little surfer and skater says she loves both sports and could n't possibly choose between the two @entity41 started skating when her parents decided there were times when it was too dangerous to be out in the water despite her big dreams , the flying squirrel - a nickname which stuck as a toddler when she befriended the furry animal while her family lived in the @entity154 - has only just started in her first year at school			1
however there are times when she wishes she was elsewhere			0
' when there ’s a big swell or the weather is nice , she says she wants to go out in the water or skating , ' mrs @entity37 said			2
' people say it 's funny hearing that from a little girl			0
' so i asked her why she loves it so much and she simply said : " it 's just what i do "			0
' @entity41 was diagnosed with @entity92 which means she is steroid dependent the six - year - old 's condition and age wo n't get in the way of her big dreams			1
