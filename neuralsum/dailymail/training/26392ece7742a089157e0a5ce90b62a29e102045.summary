drinking lots of cola could affect your bones we 're drinking more soft drinks than ever before - on average , 25 gallons each a year			1
but what is it doing to our health ? last week , @entity11 researchers suggested that girls who frequently had fizzy drinks were more likely to start puberty early			2
and it 's not just sugary drinks - diet versions , even sparkling water , can have an effect on health , as @entity19 reports ... 1			1
they speed up ageing people who drink the equivalent of two cans of full - sugar cola daily may age more quickly than people who never drink it , say @entity11 researchers			1
last year , scientists at the @entity30 found these people had @entity33 changes that made their cells 4.6 years older - their telomeres , the tiny ' caps ' that protect the ends of our chains of dna , were shorter			1
' @entity41 length has an impact on cell repair and regeneration and that is linked to the ageing process , ' says dr @entity47 , a consultant dermatologist at @entity48 in @entity49			0
' ' a great deal of research is looking at how telomere length can affect that process			0
they trigger sugar cravings drinking just two cans of sugary fizzy drinks a day dulls people 's perceptions of sweet tastes and makes them crave sugar even more , says dr @entity62 , a physiologist at the @entity63 who led a study into the effects of fizzy drinks on the body			1
' because sweetness is strongly connected to the reward system in the brain , people may increase the frequency of their use of sugar as a result			0
' the bubbles , too , could make you want more sugar			2
carbon dioxide acts as an acid which enhances our responses to other tastes , such as sugar , says dr @entity62			0
' though the sugar may create the craving responses , the acidity or fizz of the drink makes the pleasantness of the taste even stronger			2
this could explain why people prefer carbonated water over still			0
they have been linked to cancer women who have more than three sugary drinks - fizzy or otherwise - a week may have an increased risk of developing breast cancer			1
last year , researchers from @entity100 in @entity101 found that the more sugary and fizzy drinks consumed by women , the greater the density of their breasts - a known risk factor for cancer			1
it is not clear how the two might be linked and more research is needed			0
' women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous , ' explains dr @entity116 , a medical oncologist at the @entity117			1
' it can increase the risk factor four-fold			0
it may be linked to higher levels of oestrogen , which is associated with breast cancer			2
' drinking just two cans of sugary fizzy drinks a day dulls people 's perceptions of sweet tastes 4			1
they may damage bones drinking large quantities of cola could affect your bones , @entity11 researchers have suggested			0
this is because they often contain high levels of phosphoric acid - added to cola - type drinks to give them a tangy taste , and tingle when swallowed			1
a 2006 study by nutritional epidemiologists at @entity144 in @entity145 found that women who drank cola daily had lower bone mineral density in their hips than those who drank it once a week , regardless of their age , total calcium intake or use of cigarettes and alcohol			2
the body naturally strives to maintain balanced levels of calcium and phosphorus - so when there is excess phosphorus , calcium is released from the bones to correct the balance			0
researchers did n't find this effect when women drank other fizzy drinks			2
it 's possible that the caffeine in the cola had an impact , since caffeine has been associated with risk of lower bone density			1
if you suffer from bloating , the extra gas will make it worse the @entity179 says that while there is ' no clear evidence ' of fizzy drinks having a detrimental effect on bone health , women may want to moderate their intake			1
the other problem is that people prefer fizzy drinks to calcium - rich milk , adds dr @entity191 , an osteoporosis expert based at @entity193			2
they cause bloating when we have a fizzy drink , the gas - namely carbonic acid - fills the stomach with air , creating pressure which pushes the air back up the gullet ( or oesophagus ) causing a belch			2
and if you suffer from bloating , the extra gas will make it worse , says dr @entity208 , a consultant gastroenterologist at the @entity209 in @entity117 , as the air will simply sit in the stomach			0
these bubbles eventually burst and get reabsorbed into the blood , he adds			0
@entity215 drinks can also aggravate irritable bowel syndrome , a disorder linked to digestive system problems			1
they attack your teeth @entity222 reacts with the bacteria in plaque ( the sticky coating on your teeth ) and produces harmful acids that can cause decay , making sugary fruit juices a threat to oral health			2
but fizzy drinks may cause even greater damage			0
a study by the @entity235 found that full - sugar cola is ten times as corrosive as fruit juices in the first three minutes of drinking , even though they contain similar amounts of sugar			1
it 's thought citric acid added to give drinks their tangy taste might be to blame			2
' even diet colas , though low in sugar , can be bad for teeth , because of the citric acid in diet and sweetened fizzy drinks , ' said professor @entity252 , scientific adviser to the @entity253			0
@entity215 water can also damage teeth because it contains carbonic acid , formed when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water , which erodes tooth enamel			0
' even one glass can cause microscopic levels of the outer surface of the enamel to dissolve , and when we consume something acidic , the mouth stays acidic for 45 minutes before returning to a normal ph level , ' says professor @entity267 of @entity269 's @entity268			0
however , you 'd need to drink sparkling water on a daily basis for years to suffer the effect - one or two glasses a week wo n't hurt			1
they bombard your liver @entity215 drinks with high levels of fruit juice have been linked to fatty liver disease			1
a 2009 @entity282 study found that people who have two cans of fizzy fruit drinks a day were five times more likely to develop the condition , a precursor to cirrhosis ( scarring of the liver ) and liver cancer			1
the drinks have high levels of fruit sugar , readily absorbed by the liver and converted into fat			1
and upmarket fizzy drinks are no healthier as sparkling elderflower and sports drinks can contain up to 13tsp of sugar , compared with around 9tsp in supermarket cola , campaign group action on @entity222 said last year			1
although the evidence is inconclusive the study suggests diet drinks have a similar effect by tricking the body into thinking it has had sugar			0
fizzy drinks could actually be bad for children with stomach bugs 8			0
they can harm a child 's tummy flat cola or lemonade is a popular remedy for an upset stomach , but it could actually be bad for children with stomach bugs			0
the lining of the stomach and intestines are often temporarily damaged by stomach bugs , and high - sugar drinks can make this worse , possibly because bacteria feed off sugar , says dr @entity329 , who chaired the committee that wrote the @entity332 official guidelines on treating children 's stomach bugs			1
these warned parents against giving children these drinks , saying water with oral salt solution , such as @entity340 , is preferable as it contains the right minerals and sugar			0
diet drinks can be problematic because the sweeteners may be difficult to absorb by the stomach , increasing the risk of diarrhoea says dr @entity347 , consultant gastroenterologist at the @entity348			0
whatever people think , carbonated drinks , fizzy or flat , wo n't get rid of bacteria causing a bad stomach , adds @entity354 , professor of gastroenterology at the @entity356			0
they may bring on puberty early drinking more than one sugary drink a day could bring on a girl 's periods early , suggested @entity11 scientists last week			1
in a study of 6,000 adolescent girls , researchers from @entity366 found that those drinking more than 1.5 sugar - sweetened beverages daily had their first period 2.7 months earlier than those who had two a week or fewer			0
drinks with added sugar raise levels of insulin - the hormone that mops up glucose from the blood - which in turn may lead to higher concentrations of female sex hormones such as oestrogen			2
the researchers suggest this also put girls at higher risk of breast cancer , as early oestrogen exposure may increase the risk of certain types of the disease .			1
