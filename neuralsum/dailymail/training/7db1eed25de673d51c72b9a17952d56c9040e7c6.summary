by @entity0 published : 19:34 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 19:34 est , 28 october 2013 @entity1 , the chief inspector of prisons , backed the sacking of two guards at @entity5 in @entity6 two guards at an immigration detention centre have been sacked for ‘ sexual activity ’ with a woman detainee , a report reveals today			1
two men were sacked as a result of ‘ inappropriate behaviour ’ with a detainee at @entity5 in @entity6			1
a third female guard was fired for failing to blow the whistle when the woman came forward , inspectors said			1
@entity1 , the chief inspector of prisons , said sexual activity with a detainee can ‘ never be less than abusive ’ and backed the sackings			1
the centre is run by services firm @entity26 - which has come under fire in recent months over allegations it overcharged taxpayers for tagging criminals			1
following the sex abuse allegations , mr @entity1 ordered more than 50 confidential interviews with detainees			1
but in his report , published today , he said there was no evidence of a ‘ wider culture of victimisation or systematic abuse ’ at the 400 - bed centre - which is @entity42 ’s largest immigration removal centre for women			1
his report also found 100 illegal entrants a month were found climbing out of lorries in the @entity46 alone			2
some six hundred were detected and taken to @entity5 over a six month period			0
a police investigation into the sexual activity allegations was launched last month following claims from a 23 - year - old @entity53 woman who was held at @entity5			0
it is thought the woman has launched legal action against the centre			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ we were concerned to find that two staff had engaged in sexual activity with a female detainee , something that can never be less than abusive given the vulnerability of the detained population , and these staff had rightly been dismissed			1
’ the report said : ‘ before the inspection , two members of staff had rightly been dismissed as a result of inappropriate behaviour with a detainee , and a third had been dismissed because of a failure to safeguard the detainee concerned			1
‘ steps had been taken to minimise the risks of this occurring again in the future , including a programme of training , but continuing vigilance was needed			0
’ @entity82 ’s @entity81 holds mainly single adult women and there is a short - term holding facility for adult @entity86 said more female staff were needed urgently as there were not enough for a mainly women ’s establishment			2
it also expressed concern that male staff entered women ’s rooms without waiting for a reply after knocking			0
women said they were ‘ embarrassed ’ by male officers carrying out searches of their rooms and personal property			0
a number of women at the centre were detained for long periods , including one for almost four years			2
this picture shows @entity107 in @entity108 , not the centre in question @entity111 , @entity26 ’s contract director , said : ‘ we are really pleased that this inspection report recognises the improvements @entity26 has made at @entity5 and considers it to be an establishment where residents feel safe and there is little violence			1
‘ our managers and staff have worked hard to establish and maintain good relationships with the residents , who are vulnerable people in the middle of a distressing and difficult experience			0
‘ however , we are not complacent			0
as the @entity124 report says , we need to make further improvements and we are already working closely with the @entity126 to implement their recommendations			0
’ a @entity126 spokesman said : ‘ detention is a vital tool that helps us remove those with no right to be in the country , but it is essential that our facilities are well run , safe and secure			2
‘ safeguarding those in our care is our utmost priority and misconduct is dealt with swiftly and robustly			0
‘ we are carefully considering the contents of the report and will respond to each of its recommendations in due course			0
