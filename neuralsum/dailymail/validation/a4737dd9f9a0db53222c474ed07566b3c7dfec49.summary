in a new twist in the continuing saga of missing @entity2 , a towelette that was washed up on a @entity4 beach is now being examined to try and find out if it could have come from the disappeared plane			1
the small pre-moistened paper towel that was in a @entity10 sealed packet has been sent to @entity11 for testing and verification after being found by a couple walking along a beach in @entity16 in july last year , @entity7 reported			1
the news comes just days after the one year anniversary of the plane 's disappearance , with 239 people on board			1
@entity23 and @entity24 discovered the unopened packet at @entity16 , 200 kilometres north of @entity26 , and said it was ‘ unopened , which was very unusual ’			1
the @entity44 reported that experts believe it 's possible for a small package such as the towelette to travel long distances without sustaining damage			1
however , experts believe that the package may not provide any helpful information as to the disappearance of the plane			1
' a 6cm x 8cm moist towelette in wrapping branded with the @entity10 logo was found at @entity58 on 2 july 2014			2
it was handed in to the @entity4 police , ' said a spokesperson for the @entity62			1
' it is unlikely , however , that such a common item with no unique identifier could be conclusively linked with @entity2 , ' reported the @entity66			1

it was then tracked by @entity75 ’s military radar heading towards the @entity76			0
@entity23 and @entity24 discovered the unopened packet at @entity16 , 200 kilometres north of @entity26 the @entity2 flight disappeared on the may 8 with 239 people on board the anniversary of the plane 's disappearance was matched by a report which revealed that the battery of an underwater locator beacon on the flight had expired more than a year before the incident			1
the update on the progress of the probe surrounding the @entity10 plane indicates those looking for the aircraft would have had less chance of finding it			0
apart from the anomaly of the beacon , the report devoted many of its 584 pages to describe the complete normality of the flight - shedding little light on one of aviation 's biggest mysteries			0
the significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent , except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane , even if they were in its vicinity			0
the report said : ‘ the sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents , and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability			0

meanwhile , @entity274 370 - a support group for the relatives - hosted a ‘ @entity280 ’ at a shopping centre in @entity72 with songs , poems and prayers			2
