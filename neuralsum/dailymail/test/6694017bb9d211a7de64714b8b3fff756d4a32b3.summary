@entity0 caused huge a backlash when it unveiled campaign slogan ' the @entity3 ' splashed across an image of skinny models			1
more than 27,000 people signed a @entity8 petition started by three students asking for an apology , and for the initiative to be scrapped			1
and a few days later , the @entity13 lingerie firm changed the wording of the advertisement - but that has n't stopped similar brands poking fun at the ridiculous message of the original slogan			0
the d + label says its image is ' empowering ' , especially with the widespread call for real models alongside campaigns like # droptheplus - sparked by a model who was labelled ' plus ' because she was bigger than sample size - an @entity45 size 4			2
it coincides with the shortlist of their annual global star in a bra contest , where a ' real woman ' wins the job of being its lingerie model			1
hopefuls enter online and the winner becomes the face and body of @entity28 , and gets a year - long modelling contract with @entity59 , a trip to the @entity61 and Â£ 1,000 spending money			2
@entity0 caused huge consumer backlash when it unveiled its campaign last year the final ten contenders feature in the powerful new image			1
@entity66 , who is pictured centre - left in the group shot , says : ' making the top 10 ( and hopefully winning ) is a brilliant opportunity for me to spread my belief that everyone should be confident about their body , no matter what shape or size they are			1
' to feel body confident you just need to be happy with who you are and surround yourself with positive people			0
confidence , a warm personality and a smile is the most beautiful thing a girl can have			0
' the next stage in the competition is to get support with public votes , which can be done through the @entity92 website			0
@entity28 has said : ' with the public outcry for the use of more realistic images in the media , @entity98 in a @entity92 champions the use of relatable role models and promotes a positive approach to body image			0
' we want to show you exactly how our lingerie will look and fit on a variety of body shapes , cementing that there is n't one type of perfect body			0
