if you 've ever fancied owning a slice of some of the most beautiful countryside @entity4 has to offer , then now ’s your chance			0
a stunning mountain lake , a stretch of rocky shoreline and several sites of ancient woodland , home to red deer and red squirrels , are among eight sites being sold by the @entity16			1
but the sale has provoked anger among locals who say it would have @entity16 poet @entity23 ‘ turning in his grave ’			1
the possible sale of beautiful countryside in the @entity16 such as @entity26 , an area of shoreline alongside @entity29 on the market for £ 90,000 , has angered locals @entity31 , a glacial lake popular with swimmers in @entity33 , is up for sale with a guide price of £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 they are angry that they were not consulted about the decision to sell the picturesque sites – worth a total of up to £ 665,000 – and at the ‘ sheer speed ’ of the sale , which is being rushed through in five weeks			1
perhaps the most impressive site is @entity31 , a ‘ majestic ’ 24 - acre glacial lake in @entity33 , high above @entity29 and @entity45 , which is popular with wild swimmers			1
it is up for sale with a guide price of £ 20,000 to £ 30,000			2
forty - one acres of woodland at @entity51 , near @entity52 , is being sold with a guide price of £ 130,000			0
the site has a 215 - year - old @entity56 listed viewing tower and is home to red squirrels , door mice , and roe and red deer			0
@entity26 , a stretch of shoreline along @entity29 , is for sale with a guide price of £ 70,000 to £ 90,000			2
the ten - acre site has stunning views , a small beach and oak , birch and holly woodland			2
the @entity16 , the government - funded body responsible for managing the park , insists strict covenants on the land ensure the sites will be protected for the public and rights of way will not be affected			1
but some locals fear access could be restricted , woodland and historic dry stone walls may not be properly managed and that wealthy buyers may apply for planning permission to build on the land			1
majestic : @entity88 , a woodland home to red squirrels , is being sold with a guide price of £ 130,000 @entity92 , a district councillor for @entity93 and @entity94 , said : ‘ @entity23 would be turning in his grave if he knew what was happening			1
everyone is incredibly upset , especially because it has been handled so badly , with no consultation			0
@entity31 is the only tarn left under the park authority ’s ownership			0
you would think they would want to keep hold of it , not sell it to the highest bidder			2
’ last week the @entity107 stepped in to urge the government to halt the sale			0
all bids are due in by thursday but local groups hoping to raise the cash for a community bid say they had no chance to secure enough money in five weeks			0
the park authority says it has lost £ 1.56million of government funding over the past five years and has no option but to sell			0
it says it has a duty to get value for money for the taxpayer and that a public body need not own the land to be a good custodian of it			0
chief executive @entity128 described the decision to sell the land as ‘ good management ’ in ‘ the existing financial climate ’ .			1
