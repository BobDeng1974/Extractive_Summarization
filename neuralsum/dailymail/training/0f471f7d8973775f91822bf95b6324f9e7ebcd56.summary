by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter as many as 75 scientists at the @entity4 in @entity5 may have been exposed to dangerous anthrax bacteria because of a safety problem at one of its labs			1
@entity11 officials at the @entity13 federal government labs say the risk of infection is low , but that all of the potentially affected staff members are being monitored or given antibiotics as a precaution			1
the issue occurred when bacteria samples that were not completely inactivated were moved from a higher level biosafety lab to a lower level one that was not designed to handle such samples			1
the employees have not shown any symptoms but are being treated the problem was discovered last friday , when live anthrax bacteria were found on some materials being gathered for disposal , the @entity4 said in a statement			1
dr @entity39 , director of the environmental health and safety compliance office at the @entity4 , told @entity0 that after the discovery , the agency immediately began contacting individuals working in the labs who may have unknowingly handled live anthrax bacteria			1
' no employee has shown any symptoms of anthrax illness , ' @entity39 said			1
he added that the normal incubation period can take up to five to seven days , though there are documented cases of the illness occurring some 60 days after exposure			2
scene : the issue occurred at one of the labs for the @entity4 in @entity5 symptoms of anthrax infection differ depending on how the victim comes into contact with the bacteria - through touching , inhaling or consuming			1
if the subject touches the anthrax , symptoms usually start within seven days and can include itchy sores that form blisters and swelling			1
immediate treatment is necessary as 20 per cent of those who touch anthrax may die if it spreads to their blood			0
if the victim inhales the anthrax , they might suffer from a fever , headache , cough , shortness of breath and chest pain			0
the outlook is bleaker for those who inhale it - with up to 90 per cent of cases becoming fatal			0
if someone consumes meat infected with anthrax , symptoms include abdominal pain , nausea and mouth sores and , again , treatment is vital because anthrax in the blood system is fatal			2
to test for anthrax , skin cultures or biopsies can be taken , as well as chest x-rays or spinal taps			0
if anthrax is found , antibiotics can be used to treat it			2
@entity39 said as many as seven researchers may have come into direct contact with the live anthrax , but the agency is casting as wide a net as possible to make sure all employees at the agency who may have walked into any of the labs at risk are being offered treatment			2
around 75 individuals are being offered a 60 - day course of treatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin as well as an injection with an anthrax vaccine			0
@entity39 said it is too early to determine whether the transfer was accidental or intentional			0
he said all employees who were doing procedures to inactivate the bacteria were working in a biosecurity laboratory and were ' tier one select agent approved , ' meaning they had undergone a security reliability review and deemed to be ' stable , trustworthy individuals '			1
@entity39 said the @entity4 is conducting an internal investigation to discover how the exposure occurred and said disciplinary measures would be taken if warranted			1
' this should not have happened , ' he said			0
for those exposed , he said : ' we 're taking care of it			0
we will not let our people be at risk			0
' if scientists came into contact with the anthrax , they could experience a range of symptoms , including blisters , shortness of breath , fever and chest pain			1
according to @entity152 , anthrax infection kills due to the toxins the bacteria produced when they 're in the body			2
a recent study revealed that the toxins , lethal toxin and edema toxin , attack the cells of the heart muscle and the liver			0
the toxins can penetrate immune cells , killing them and slowly breaking down the body 's defense system , which causes hemorrhaging that floods the lungs - making it difficult to breathe - and poisons the bloodstream			0
the victim must be treated immediately because once it 's in the bloodstream , it can be fatal .			0

the scientists at the @entity13 @entity4 are being monitored or given antibiotics as a precaution
issue occurred when bacteria samples were not *properly* inactivated and were moved to a lower safety lab not designed to handle them
officials say none of the employees have shown symptoms
