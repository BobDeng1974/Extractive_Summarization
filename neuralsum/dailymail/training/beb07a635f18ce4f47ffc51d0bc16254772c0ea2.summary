health tourists must be given free treatment by @entity2 because it is their human right , say @entity4 bosses			1
new guidelines tell doctors across @entity7 they must register any foreign patient who asks for care otherwise it would be ‘ discriminatory ’			1
these include asylum seekers , overseas students or tourists coming for a short holiday			1
once registered , they will be entitled to the same @entity4 care as all other patients and can receive free blood tests , jabs and – in some cases – free prescription drugs			0
must treat : new guidelines tell doctors across @entity7 they must register any foreign patient who asks for care otherwise it would be ' discriminatory ' in fact , the new rules will give overseas patients more rights than those living in the @entity28 who can be turned away from surgeries if they live a few yards outside its catchment area			1
there are also fears the ruling will make it even harder for local patients to get an appointment			0
free : once registered , health tourists will be entitled to the same @entity4 care as other patients including free blood tests and jabs already half of patients can not get an appointment with their doctor within 48 hours , according to the government ’s own figures			2
some family doctors are furious at the guidelines and describe them as a ‘ charter for health tourism ’			1
they say that such patients , once registered at a surgery , will also find it far easier to be referred to hospital for thousands of pounds of free treatment			1
by law , overseas patients are not entitled to be treated at hospital – unless it is urgent – but staff rarely check on their backgrounds			0
until now , gp practices were not legally obliged to register foreigners and many turn away patients if they do not have passports or ‘ proof of address ’ documents			2
but the new guidelines issued to all doctors in @entity7 will change this			0
one gp , who wished to remain anonymous , said : ‘ i am not sure the @entity28 taxpayer should be paying for the world ’s health treatment for free			2
’ and @entity77 mp @entity76 , who is campaigning for tougher regulation on health tourism , said : ‘ it is alarming that managers are passing these kind of diktats to doctors , many of whom are rightly worried that gp registration is effectively buying free treatment on the @entity4			1
‘ this is not just about the money , vital though that is – we can not have the @entity4 , paid for by taxpayers , being abused by people who pay nothing into the system and who are not eligible for free care			0
’ mr @entity76 has obtained figures showing that health tourists currently owe the @entity4 £ 40million in unpaid medical bills			0
health tourists : asylum seekers , overseas students or tourists ( pictured ) coming for a short holiday are eligible for treatment under the new rules which give overseas patients more rights than those living in the @entity28 in the last year nearly 3,600 ‘ overseas visitors ’ have had hospital treatment worth at least £ 1,000 a time			1
national guidelines say it would be discriminatory for @entity2 not to treat health tourists			1
@entity115 , one of four strategic health authorities in @entity7 , has backed up this advice with further guidelines explaining they will ‘ promote human rights and public health ’			2
local fears : there is concern that the ruling will make it even harder for local patients to get an appointment			0
already half of patients can not get an appointment with their doctor within 48 hours dr @entity133 , a gp who practises in @entity136 , @entity137 , said : ‘ the guidance is not worth the paper it is written on			0
we do not have endless resources			0
why should we give these patients – be they from @entity143 , @entity144 , the @entity145 or @entity146 – free treatment ? ' alarming ' : @entity77 mp @entity76 is campaigning for tougher regulation on health tourism ‘ we can not go to those countries and get free treatment ourselves			1
’ last week an investigation by @entity153 ’s @entity152 found that staff working at @entity155 were taking bribes of £ 800 to register health tourists on surgery lists			2
one manager , @entity159 , who worked at a practice in @entity161 , @entity137 , has since been suspended			0
some doctors say it is cost - effective – not to mention humane – to register overseas patients			1
dr @entity165 , head of science and ethics at the @entity168 , said it would be far cheaper to give patients insulin for diabetes , for example , rather than later treating them in @entity174 after they had fallen into a coma			0
they also believe it could help prevent the spread of certain diseases such as tuberculosis which is commonly brought in by overseas patients .			0

foreigners must be given free treatment by @entity2 - it is their human right
new guidelines *dictate* that doctors must register any foreign patient
includes asylum seekers , overseas students or tourists on a short holiday
some *gps* are furious , describing changes as a ' charter for health tourism '
