sir @entity0 , the quiet years			1
no singular drive , no all - consuming discipline that keeps him on the go from pre-dawn ‘ til the streetlights are burning bright			0
as this most honoured of sporting knights puts it himself : ‘ i do n’t have obsessions now			0
’ there ’s certainly nothing that comes close to football for the famous @entity0 , who has instead chosen to spend his retirement devoting himself to any number of causes ; at last count , he was associated with a good dozen charities or foundations			1
and it will surprise no - one to learn that , while doing his bit for @entity25 , @entity21 ’s et al , a little of the old firebrand spirit still burns brightly			2
if you want to build a statue to a @entity30 radical who led a rent strike and changed more than just her own wee corner of the world , sir @entity0 is the man you call			1
sir @entity0 watches on from the stands during @entity36 's clash with @entity37 on april 18 @entity0 , in @entity38 on thursday to make a £ 5,000 donation to the remember @entity40 , actually physically writing out a cheque towards a permanent memorial , revealed that his life has n’t so much slowed down as merely changed gear since he stepped down as @entity36 manager in the summer of 2013			1
the 73 - year - old , who had lived and breathed football since making his senior debut at the age of just 16 , was famous not just for the trophies won – his haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily @entity55 ’s most successful ever manager – but the hours put in			1
raised to believe that hard work was as necessary as breathing , @entity0 ’s ability to push players hard was based at least in part on the example he set himself			1
that work ethic , simply part of his upbringing in @entity30 , is n’t something he ’s let slide just because he no longer has one demanding day job			1
‘ what i ’m doing is making sure i remain active , ’ said @entity0 , looking trim and at ease			1
‘ that ’s important when you retire , so i ’ve got many things on my plate			2
‘ it ’s funny , though			2
it ’s a different kind of work			2
whereas at @entity36 i was in at quarter to seven every morning , and be there to tea time every day , that was one constant thing all your life – i was doing one thing			1
@entity0 celebrates @entity36 's @entity85 title victory in may 2013 with @entity86 ‘ now i ’m doing different things , which is maybe even more exhausting ! there is no one thing , nothing like that			1
i do n’t have obsessions now			0
i do n’t get up at six o’clock in the morning , that ’s for sure			2
i have a long lie now and again			0
’ football is no longer the dominant factor in his life , with even questions on the game receiving short shrift , although – and this was n’t always the case back in his managerial days - he was very polite in his refusal , answering the one out - of - bounds query by saying : listen , @entity105 are doing fantastic			1
they ’ ve got a great manager and i love that club			2
but i ’m here to talk about @entity111			0
i do n’t blame you for asking … ’ wherever @entity0 goes , he takes his native burgh with him , freely attributing a great deal of his sporting success to the lessons he learned either at home , at @entity119 or @entity120			1
‘ your upbringing is important , ’ he said yesterday , adding : ‘ i think it ’s the foundation of your life			1
i was fortunate enough to have good parents who did the best they could possibly do for me			0
‘ there are many people who have said i came from a poor background			0
i do n’t think people brought up in my time thought they were poor			0
@entity0 and then @entity132 boss @entity131 shout instructions from the sideline at @entity135 in may 2013 ‘ talking about the role of the housewife and mother , they made sure the food was always on the table			1
that was the case with me			0
‘ you were always dressed the best way you could possibly be – and you were taught to be the best you can be			0
‘ that came not just from the parents but from teachers at school			0
i do n’t think necessarily education is about learning lessons in school			0
it ’s about inspiring you			2
and i was inspired by many people			0
’ @entity0 was n’t taught about @entity111 at school , admitting that he ’d only come across her tale when looking through a book of historical @entity38 photographs complied by the great @entity160			1
@entity0 's haul of 49 assorted cups and prizes making him easily @entity55 ’s most successful ever manager @entity111 famously led rent strikes in @entity38 at the height of the @entity167 , forcing a change in the law with the introduction of the @entity171			1
a consistent campaigner throughout her life , she went on to become one of the city ’s first female councillors , the first female @entity174 and female magistrate			1
the fund - raising campaign is aimed at building a statue of @entity111 , to be erected on @entity180 , @entity0 explaining his involvement by saying : ‘ there was a connection with @entity30 , which is what stirred the real interest in me			2
‘ there is that great photo of all the housewives in @entity30 standing outside the close ; that rent men was never getting in that close			0
that registers deeply with me			0
i ’ve looked at that photograph many , many times			0
that is where my interest comes from – and it ’s a great cause			0
’ for further information about the campaign please go to : @entity198 to donate go to www.justgiving.com/r-m-b-a , alternatively send a text to 70070 with the message @entity202 then add the amount you wish to donate : £ 1 , £ 5 or £ 10 .			0
