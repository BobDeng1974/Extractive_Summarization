@entity0 will be forced to pay benefits to even more migrants under @entity3 plans to be fought over in a politically explosive court case			1
officials in @entity6 last night confirmed that the @entity7 is taking legal action to make @entity0 lift existing restrictions that prevent some migrants claiming child benefit and child tax credit in the @entity0			1
the news comes just days after @entity15 pledged to cut handouts in a bid to reduce soaring immigration			1
the case at @entity21 ’s highest court will further anger the public and politicians who have called on the government to tighten up @entity0 ’s generous welfare system and make the country a less attractive destination for would - be immigrants			0
latest figures show 24,000 families are currently claiming child benefit of at least £ 89 a month for 38,500 children living abroad , at an estimated cost of £ 30 million a year , while 4,000 claim child tax credit			1
on friday , the prime minister pledged to end the ‘ exporting ’ of child benefit , as well as to ban migrant workers from claiming tax credits until they have worked in the @entity0 for four years			1
last night @entity45 , one of the @entity47 backbenchers demanding a tough limit on @entity3 migrants , said : ‘ free movement is about the right to work , not the right to claim benefits			2
the @entity3 should accept our rules are the will of the @entity0 people and @entity58			2
prime minister @entity15 who had pledged to cut handouts such as child benefits for migrants in a bid to reduce soaring immigration ‘ it just shows how big a battle we ’ve got to get anything close to a sensible position			1
even when we ’re asking for things that are not unreasonable , it just suggests they ’re going to push us to the exit door			0
’ the case , to be heard at the @entity73 , centres on the ‘ right - to - reside ’ test that @entity3 migrants must pass before they can claim benefits in this country			2
@entity77 introduced it in 2004 as concerns began to be raised about the ‘ open doors ’ policy that would eventually see more than one million eastern @entity81 arrive over a decade			0
the test allows officials to check if benefit claimants are ‘ economically active ’ – in a job , self - employed or looking for work – or able to support themselves			0
but since 2011 , the @entity7 has been telling the @entity0 that the right - to - reside rule is discriminatory , as it makes it easier for native @entity0 to access social security than migrants			1
last year , employment commissioner @entity92 , a @entity93 economist known as the ‘ most left - wing man in @entity6 ’ , said he would take the @entity0 to court over the test			0
it can be disclosed today that court papers were lodged on june 27 this year			0
in the claim form , the @entity7 calls on the @entity73 to ‘ declare that the @entity0 , by the requirement that a claimant for child benefit or child tax credit have a right to reside in the @entity0 , has failed to comply with its obligations ’ under rules that guarantee all @entity81 residents the right to benefits in other member states			1
its argument goes on : ‘ @entity7 maintains that in requiring a claimant of child benefit and child tax credit to have a right to reside in the @entity0 as a condition of being treated as resident there , the @entity0 has imposed a condition that @entity116 ( @entity7 ) no 883/2004 does not permit			2
‘ alternatively the @entity7 submits that by imposing a condition of entitlement to social security benefits that is automatically met by its own nationals , the @entity0 has created a situation of direct discrimination against nationals of other member states			1
’ the @entity7 originally intended the case to cover a wider range of payments , including state pension credit , jobseekers ’ allowance and incapacity benefit – in total claimed by an estimated 400,000 migrants in the @entity0			1
but it will now just consider child benefit and child tax credit , after a @entity73 case earlier this month ruled that a migrant woman in @entity137 could not claim a jobseekers ’ allowance because she was not looking for work but remained entitled to child benefit			0
if @entity0 were to lose the crucial case , unlikely to be settled before next may ’s general election , thousands of migrants with no intention of paying taxes would be able to claim child benefit here			0
immigrants queue up outside a polling station in @entity151 to vote for a new @entity153 president at £ 89 a month for one child , and available to all but the highest earners , it is far more generous than in countries such as @entity158 , where parents get less than £ 15 a month , or @entity160 , where it is just £ 3			0
a defeat would also be a huge setback in @entity15 ’s plan , announced on friday , to stop new arrivals claiming most benefits until they have paid four years ’ worth of @entity166			1
he is already facing having to convince other @entity81 leaders to agree to re-write key treaties			0
professor @entity169 , an expert in @entity3 law at @entity171 , said : ‘ this is a very important case regarding whether the @entity0 can deny benefits to other @entity3 citizens and could potentially have a big impact on mr @entity15 ’s renegotiation plans			1
’ a @entity178 insider insisted the right - to - reside test was ‘ vital and fair ’ , adding : ‘ we are not only fighting this , but pressing ahead with plans to strengthen the @entity0 benefits and tax credits system to ensure it can not be abused			2
’ next month , the @entity187 - based court will pass judgment in a separate case about whether or not @entity0 can opt out of a decision to give @entity192 migrants more rights to social security systems in @entity21			0
the @entity0 has already lost two similar cases involving other countries outside the @entity3			2
one senior figure in the @entity73 , advocate general @entity198 , has already said @entity0 should not be allowed to opt out of the new rules for @entity192 because there is ‘ no room ’ for an @entity21 ’			0
a source close to work and pensions secretary @entity202 said : ‘ it ’s simply wrong for @entity21 to attempt this power - grab , which is why we are fighting these cases			0

@entity0 could be forced to pay benefits to more migrants under @entity3 plans
