by @entity0 published : 16:32 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 16:32 est , 30 august 2013 the chiselled features of @entity2 do n’t just turn heads , they set hearts a-flutter and reduce hitherto dynamic , accomplished women to simpering schoolgirls			1
the towering star of @entity8 and @entity9 is lusted after by everyone from the woman next door to the highest paid female tv presenter in the country			1
according to @entity15 , his co-star in legal drama @entity9 , she can slip into the public gallery at the @entity19 to research her role unrecognised , but when @entity2 once accompanied her , ' women were cooing and going all gooey over him			1
' @entity23 totty : @entity2 will appear in the new series of @entity25 's @entity8 which begins this week and who can forget that embarrassing interview last year on this morning , when @entity28 , who ’s interviewed @entity30 stars , prime ministers and @entity33 heroes , stammered , giggled and blushed before finally burying her face in a cushion to mask her discomfort ? no , there ’s no denying @entity2 ’s a heart - throb			1
as his actress wife and former @entity43 voiceover doyenne @entity40 might have purred , ' not just any heart - throb , but @entity45 ’s heart - throb			1
' because , while most of his other pretty boy contemporaries have moved to @entity30 , the most handsome home - grown talent on @entity45 tv is thankfully still here , gracing our screens for up to six months of the year			1
we meet on the appropriately creepy set of the fourth series of his horror detective show @entity8			1
the disused @entity57 in north @entity58 is a former @entity60 masterpiece now full of mysterious dark corridors , strange noises and rumours of ghosts			1
@entity2 , 42 , has been doing 12 - hour shifts all week , but he strides into the room with a big smile			1
happily married : @entity2 with his ( extremely fortunate ) wife @entity40 he ’s as charismatic and charming as he is handsome , and he ’s obviously used to calming down excitable women			1
' when an attractive woman finds you attractive and says nice things about you it ’s fine , ' he says recalling the @entity75 incident			1
' @entity28 ’s lovely so i ’m not complaining			1
i did n’t mind at all ! ' and what does his poor wife make of all the fuss ? she is , after all , no shrinking violet , as @entity2 revealed recently when he told an interviewer she had a stand - up row with his mother in @entity58 ’s @entity86 restaurant which became so heated neither woman ate and they left in separate taxis			1
' @entity40 started so many fundamental changes in my life , and there ’s been no resistance from me			1
she ’s just the right woman for me , she " gets " me			1
i can be myself with her ' @entity40 has since said the two women have made up and now have ' a very good relationship '			1
' she is n’t threatened , she ’s very secure , ' @entity2 says of the mother of his two children , @entity98 , nine , and @entity99 , six			1
he and the former @entity101 star have been together for 12 years , after working on the @entity102 play @entity103 , and despite all the attention @entity2 gets , they appear to have one of the most stable relationships in showbiz			1
before he met @entity40 , @entity2 was something of a playboy – he once dated @entity111 – but he says his marriage calmed him down and the pair recently swapped @entity58 for rural @entity114			1
most weekends , he says , they ’ll be cuddled up on the sofa with their two children and border collie , @entity120 , watching a film			1
action man : @entity2 set pulses racing during his stint in spooks and once dated popstar @entity111 legal eagle : along with his terrifying turn in @entity8 , @entity2 also stars in @entity129 drama silk ' @entity40 started so many fundamental changes in my life , and there ’s been no resistance from me			1
she ’s just the right woman for me , she " gets " me			1
i can be myself with her			2
' @entity2 was born of acting stock ; his mother is to @entity138 ’s @entity137 and his father @entity141 ’ @entity140 ’s @entity139			2
as a dyslexic who left school without any qualifications , acting seemed a natural fit			2
@entity2 was thrown out of the @entity148 drama school for ‘ being a bad influence ’ ( he argued with his teachers ) but still managed to get into the @entity151 and had a succession of small to middling parts on tv before finding fame in @entity125 as @entity158 ’s loose cannon @entity156			2
after leaving the show rather explosively in 2008 there was a brief hiatus when he tried his luck in @entity163			1
he was picked up to star in a detective drama called @entity165 and filmed the pilot ; but when it was finally commissioned he was replaced by @entity168 in the lead role			2
making it in @entity30 still remains an ambition , but @entity2 ’s come to terms with the fact it might never happen			2
' of course , the grass is always greener ; you always want to do something else , ' he says			2
' but i ’d be crazy to jack in everything i have here and go			2
the only way i ’d be available to go and work there would be to say goodbye to shows i really like and then , potentially , have nothing			2
and i ca n’t do that ; i have a family i ’m responsible for			2
' if @entity188 were to call , he adds , he might contemplate a move			2
until then he ’s enjoying what he has here			2
@entity8 was originally envisaged as a one - off series ; an intriguing story about a modern day copycat of the @entity195 killings			2
@entity2 plays the super-uptight detective inspector @entity196 , who was brought in to solve the case			2
to everyone ’s surprise it was a huge hit and 2009 ’s highest performing new drama			2
when we meet , @entity2 is filming the fourth series of the @entity25 show which , he believes , has taken on a life of its own			0
' it ’s a funny show ; it seems to be turning into something we never envisaged			0
at first you think , " how many copycat killings can there be ? " but now it ’s reinvented itself			0
' it ’s quite a different beast to the original but we think this will be our best series yet			0
it ’s rare to work on a show that gets better as it goes along but long may that continue			0
scary : even @entity2 has felt a shiver run down his spine after watching his crime drama , @entity8 ' the writers have brought in elements that relate to the first and second series while it will also focus more on what ’s happening in the police station			0
the show we ’re filming today is about witches and in the story all the characters are spooked by it			0
' there ’s a sense of evil in the station itself			0
there ’s not very much that is real about the show and my character is not the most convincing detective on tv but we enjoy the fact that there ’s something a bit ridiculous about it			0
' i think what people love about the show is its scary elements			0
i even get scared watching it			0
there was an episode last year which had a guy hiding in people ’s walls			0
after i watched it at home – and i could n’t believe i was doing this – but i made sure every door was locked			0
i think being scared gives you a thrill ; it makes you feel alive			0
' @entity2 also enjoys getting into the idiosyncrasies of his character , who ’s a bundle of repression and suffers from @entity274			0
' it ’s fun to have something like that to play with as an actor , ' he says			1
' i use it to express emotion			0
i ’m constantly trying to find new things for him to do but they ca n’t be for the sake of it ; i would n’t want to be disrespectful to people who do have ocd			0
it can be a horribly debilitating illness			0
' i ’d say i have it a bit ; @entity40 definitely would say i have it			1
i enjoy cleaning and tidying			0
i ’m not quite as bad as @entity293 but i think anyone would have ocd if they lived with my wife			0
' everything has a place in my house and if it ’s not put back in the right place , i ’m not happy			0
but i think that ’s just sensible			0
if she had her way , there would be deodorant next to jam – everything in the same cupboard ! ' ' of course , the grass is always greener ; you always want to do something else , ' he says			0
' but i ’d be crazy to jack in everything i have here and go to @entity163 ' while @entity8 airs , @entity2 will be filming @entity9 , his big show for rival channel @entity313 , in which he and @entity15 play two competing but friendly barristers			1
both shows also , coincidentally , star veteran actor @entity317			1
who @entity2 ’s known for over a decade since appearing in @entity319 – another legal drama by @entity9 ’s writer @entity321			1
in @entity322 plays @entity196 ’s disgruntled no. 2 @entity323 while in @entity9 he ’s dodgy solicitor @entity324			1
unsurprisingly the two have become good friends , bonding over a love of red wine , snooker and @entity330			0
' we have a similar sense of humour and we agree about a lot of things to do with work , ' says @entity2			0
' we text and ring each other quite a lot ; i do n’t think we ’ve ever had a cross word			0
it ’s one of the great things about becoming an actor that you get to become friends with people from different walks of life			1
' he ’s still ambitious , but for now @entity2 seems content to be a leading man on our two biggest tv channels			0
' things are going pretty well and i ’m really enjoying this journey , ' he says			0
and then , with a quick smile – but no kiss – the handsome , charming and , as i now know , housework - loving @entity2 leaves the room			0
@entity8 returns on wednesday at 9pm on @entity25 .			0

@entity9 actor used to be something of a playboy
he once dated @entity111
now he 's happily married to actress @entity40
but why has *n't* the @entity163 fallen for his charms yet ?
