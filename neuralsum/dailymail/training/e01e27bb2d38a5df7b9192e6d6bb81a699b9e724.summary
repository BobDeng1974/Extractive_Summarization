a small dinosaur the size of a crow may have had feathers on its hindlegs and limbs , as well as on its wings			1
studies of the most complete specimen of an @entity9 suggest it evolved these ' feather trousers ' to absorb shocks when landing , and to attract mates			1
researchers believe the @entity9 is the missing link between dinosaurs and birds because of its mix of sharp reptilian claws , a bony tail and a bill studded with teeth			1
studies of the most complete archaeopteryx specimen ( pictured ) suggest the small dinosaur evolved ' feather trousers ' to absorb shocks when landing			2
researchers believe the @entity9 is the missing link between dinosaurs and birds because of its mix of sharp reptilian claws , a bony tail and a bill studded with teeth the @entity9 was about 1.5ft ( 18 inches ) long with sharp reptilian claws , a bony tail and a bill studded with teeth			1
it lived around 150 million years ago in the @entity38 and the first fossil was discovered over 150 years ago in 1861 - two years after the publication of @entity41 ’s on the @entity42			0
its black wing feathers could have helped the creature flap and glide , but whether it could fly is unknown			0
an analysis of other early feathered dinosaurs - and birds - suggests the feathers evolved in relation to display and were later recruited for aerodynamic functions			2
its ‘ trouser of feathers ’ could have been used as a shock absorber during landing			0
scientists said the characteristics that make @entity9 an evolutionary intermediate are its combination of reptilian and avian features - which include a wishbone			1

dr @entity66 from the @entity67 in @entity68 , said there is evidence of quill - like feathers all over the creature ’s body - not only on the wings and tail but also the body and legs			2
the upper hindlimbs display long symmetrical feathers and there are shorter ones along the lower - suggesting this distribution during the origin of birds was more complex than previously believed			0
dr @entity66 added that , as in living birds , the feathers most likely related to body insulation , manoeuvrability , brooding , camouflage and display			0
the @entity9 ( artist 's illustration pictured ) was about 1.5ft ( 18 inches ) long with black feathers			1
it has a mix of reptilian and avian features , including a wishbone , and is considered to be the evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds this graph tracks the evolution of feathers in maniraptoran theropods			1
it shows the @entity9 14th from the left having tibial and metatarsal feather trousers but it seems plausible @entity9 used them primarily for display			2
‘ here we describe a new specimen of @entity9 with extensive feather preservation not only on the wings and tail but also on the body and legs , ' dr @entity66 said			1
‘ the specimen shows the entire body was covered in quill - like feathers			0
’ an analysis of other early feathered dinosaurs - and birds - suggests the feathers evolved in relation to display and were later recruited for aerodynamic functions			1
its ‘ trouser of feathers ’ could have also been used as a shock absorber during landing			0
the @entity9 is often described as a small crow - like creature ( stock image pictured )			2
its upper hindlimbs display long symmetrical feathers and there are shorter ones along the lower - suggesting this distribution during the origin of birds was more complex than previously believed			0

studies of the @entity9 reveal it had *plumed* ‘ trousers ’ on its hind limbs , as well as feathered wings
@entity38 dinosaur was 1.5ft ( 18 inches ) long with sharp reptilian claws
the black creature also had a bony tail and a bill studded with teeth
it has a mix of reptilian and avian features , including a wishbone and is considered to be an evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds
