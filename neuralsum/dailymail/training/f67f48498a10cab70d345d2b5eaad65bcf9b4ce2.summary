by @entity0 @entity2 ’s newly - appointed emergency financial manager wo n’t rule out bankruptcy for the city and says the step might be one he ’ll be forced to take			1
@entity6 assumes the newly created job post march 25 , but he told the @entity8 friday that he ’s comfortable orchestrating what would be the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in @entity12 history			1
the ailing @entity14 city holds around $ 14 billion in debts and @entity6 was chosen for the job by @entity18 's governor @entity17			1
big problems : lawyer @entity6 was chosen by @entity18 governor @entity17 to be @entity2 's first @entity21 and tackle the ailing city 's massive debt problems ahead of his first day , @entity6 — a veteran in corporate bankruptcy — dropped hints that it might be in the interest of the strapped city ’s creditors to help cut a deal			1
‘ @entity33 everyone needs to know : if you go into bankruptcy , ’ said the hard - hitting @entity40 attorney , ‘ chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code is weighted toward the municipality			2
’ @entity6 was careful to stress his desire to find other solutions to the city ’s extreme money woes			2
‘ i prefer to pursue a consensual resolution , ’ @entity6 said			0
regardless of @entity6 ’s preference , however , he acknowledges the threat of bankruptcy court is powerful leverage in his negotiations with creditors			2
dire straights : @entity2 's decline has been fast and steep and the city now owes its creditors around $ 14 billion after years of over-borrowing ‘ i think it can be done because the issue of the crisis is ... so significant , ’ he said			0
‘ i would think it would be reasonable within their authority to make a negotiated solution			0
’ if the city and @entity6 do proceed with the bankruptcy , reports the @entity8 , it would likely take the form of a prepackaged bankruptcy			1
in such a deal , @entity6 would work out the terms of the deal with all @entity2 ’s creditors and present them alongside his bankruptcy petition			2
those parties include vendors of goods and services , municipal bondholders , unions , pensioners , and others			0
members of such groups , many of whom are left to assume that benefits like union - level wages are on the chopping block by @entity6 , are now protesting the emergency financial manager 's appointment			0
high hopes : @entity6 , on right with @entity2 mayor @entity94 at left and @entity18 governor @entity17 in center , says ' everything 's on the table ' to save the city , including chapter 9 bankruptcy not all good : though @entity6 might help the city as a whole , groups like city workers fear cuts he 'll make will take away benefits they now enjoy @entity6 will be doing a great deal of negotiating whether or not bankruptcy enters the picture , it seems			1
though he might be @entity2 ’s best hope out of a tough situation , he does n’t see himself as a savior for the city , but rather as a man working to show @entity2 how to save itself			0
‘ i view my role as providing some architecture for a sustainable model for the city going forward			0
’ how he ’ll build such an architecture , in a city that struggles to provide its residents with basic municipal services , remains to be seen			0
but , @entity6 says ' everything 's on the table			1

@entity6 , a corporate bankruptcy *specialist* based in @entity40 , says ' everything 's on the table ' in his *quest* to save the strapped city
@entity6 was tapped by @entity18 governor @entity17 last week and though he does *n't* *officially* start until march 25 , he 's already facing huge *obstacles* and *opposition*
