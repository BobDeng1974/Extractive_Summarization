barely skin and bones , this emaciated dog was abandoned on a street and left to die			1
as the @entity6 , called @entity7 , lay in the pound , his carers thought he had given up hope			1
but a @entity11 owner took him in , helped him recover , and now this once decrepit animal has won the title of ' @entity14 '			1
these staggering images show the miraculous transformation he made after he was picked up from a @entity20 dog 's home by @entity21			1
before and after : the @entity6 was left for dead in a @entity20 dog 's home , but has since made a staggering recovery after a @entity11 expat took him in skeleton : he was virtually skin and bones and covered in cuts when he was rescued from the pound rescued : @entity11 expat @entity21 's ( pictured ) charity took the dog in and took him to the vet for treatment his amazing recovery was recognised during the @entity36 , the @entity38 's alternative to @entity39			1
mr @entity21 , 46 , said : ' when i first saw @entity7 he was big , clearly very sick and , we were told , aggressive so we we agreed to take him in			1
' at first , i thought he was a mastiff , because he was in such a bad state that it was n't clear to me what breed he really was			1
' but my friend @entity46 , who has two very lucky rescued rottweilers , knew right away that @entity7 was a rottie			2
' his progress was slow but obvious to see , and he turned out to be one of the lucky ones who do n't relapse into full - blown mange from time to time			0
' despite fears @entity7 was an aggressive animal , he was ' one of the sweetest ' animals they had encountered at @entity56			0
in pain : mr @entity21 , 46 , said @entity7 was clearly very sick when he first saw him at @entity56 dog 's home health : the staggering images show how successful the transformation has been			1
@entity63 , a volunteer at the shelter who is looking after him said : ' he looked like he had given up on life			0
' dr. @entity67 at @entity68 in @entity69 was the vet who helped with @entity7 's recovery			0
mr @entity21 said : ' dr @entity67 is the one to thank for @entity7 's amazing recovery , though we also believe that the natural , happy environment we provide and the healthy , raw diet we feed all our animals played their part in his speedy recuperation			2
' we knew we could cure him , but were astounded at what a fantastic dog had been hidden beneath the disease and depression that riddled him when he first came in			2
' more than 300,000 people logged onto the @entity38 's @entity84 page to vote for @entity7 in the @entity36 awards			0
given up : @entity7 had a drawn face and deep eyes when after he had been cruelly abandoned on the street			0
he required extensive treatment to get him back to full health mr @entity21 said : ' we are all over the moon that @entity7 was crowned @entity93 of @entity36 and hope it serves as food for thought for all those rescue organisations that kill animals like @entity7 in order to " end their suffering "			1
' he is now being looked after by @entity63 , a volunteer at the shelter			0
miss @entity103 said : ' he looked like he had given up on life			0
i fell immediately in love with the large , loveable rottie with an ironic name			0
personality : initially , volunteers feared he would be an aggressive dog , but he turned out to be ' sweet ' ' i moved into a new apartment just so i could adopt him			2
he is now a beautiful and very well loved dog			2
' mr @entity21 , originally from @entity115 , @entity116 , moved to @entity20 15 years ago and set up @entity56 to look after unwanted animals which are unlikely to be rehomed			1
he cares for feral cats , pigs which outgrew apartments they were kept in , orphaned baby squirrels , and lots of dogs , once - aggressive or fearful , blind and disabled			0
but @entity56 is now facing an uncertain future after its landlady told @entity21 she wants to sell the property which is home to 200 rescued animals			1
they face the prospect of being made homeless			0
mr @entity21 added : ' we are starting an @entity133 campaign and hoping to use @entity7 's story and @entity136 victory to help bring international attention to our plight			2
' we 're looking to buy a beautiful 2.5 - acre site to give our dogs , cats , pigs , rabbits , squirrels , pigeons , hedgehog , budgerigar , and , very soon , deer a permanent happy home			0
