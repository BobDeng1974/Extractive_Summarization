by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 believes finishing ahead of @entity3 in this year 's formula one world championship would prove to be a real feather in his cap			1
back - to - back third - place finishes in the last two grands prix behind dominant @entity10 pair @entity11 and @entity12 have elevated @entity13 's @entity2 into fourth place in the drivers ' standings			1
centre of attention : @entity2 claims finishing above @entity3 would boost his confidence reigning four - times champion @entity3 , meanwhile , has suffered gremlins this year and is now nine points adrift of @entity2 , promoted from @entity22 at the end of last season as replacement for @entity26			1
despite the regulation changes over the winter , not many would have put good money on the 24 - year - old @entity30 having the edge over @entity3 so far , but that is how the season is panning out			1
naturally , @entity2 is aware of the kudos he would gain should he still be ahead of @entity3 come the conclusion to the season in @entity37			1
' it would n't be a bad thing			0
it would give me a lot of confidence , ' said @entity2 , speaking ahead of this weekend 's @entity44 that was won by @entity3 12 months ago			2
' in saying that , i 've probably already done enough to show the guys i can do it , and when i say ' can do it ' , not specifically beat @entity48 , but to race at the front , be in a top team , and deserve to be here			0
' whatever happens in the championship , the final result , unless we win then it 's probably not going to matter			0
' they ( the team ) will probably look at specific races in the year and say ' in this one he did well ' , or ' in this he did quite well '			2
it would be a nice pat on the back i guess			0
' i 'm still smiling : @entity3 has won the @entity67 title in the last four years but has struggled to hit the front this term bearing in mind @entity3 has never finished behind a team - mate since he entered @entity67 in 2007 , @entity2 insists there is no magic to what he has achieved so far , just unwavering confidence in himself			1
' it 's important for me to try to learn from him ( @entity3 ) , and i 'd be silly not to because he 's obviously the best in the world , so i ca n't be stubborn about that , " added @entity2			2
' at the same time i work well when i focus on myself			0
if i get distracted too much with what @entity48 is doing then it takes my mind off what i need to be doing			0
on the march : @entity2 ( right ) has leaped to fourth in the championship following his third place at @entity89 surprise : @entity2 has exceeded expectations by leading @entity3 in the championship ' i have a lot of belief in my ability , and i know if i do everything i can to my best then the results will come			1
' at the moment 95 per cent is directed towards myself , and then on the side , if i can learn a bit from @entity48 , then i do			0
it 's trying to do what i know first and then worry about the rest later			0
