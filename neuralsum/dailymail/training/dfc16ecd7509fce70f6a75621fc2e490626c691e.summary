by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 14:01 est , 19 march 2012 the early history of civiilisation has been ' filled in ' a little as scientists have found settlements up to 8,000 years old dotted across @entity5			1
the area is thought to have been critical for the growth of civilisation - and thought to have been one of the first places where early man domesticated cattle			0
@entity14 scientists have created software that scans satellite images for towns and settlements - looking for telltalle lighter soil and mounds from the collapse of mud huts			1
the software has found 9,000 settlements - which @entity25 professor @entity24 describes as a ' lifetime 's worth '			1
the @entity14 software looks for signs of ancient settlements including earth disturbed by collapsing mud huts , and lighter areas of earth created by disturbed soil the new sites might reveal clues to the earliest complex human societies - although the instability of the region might hinder investigation			1
@entity24 , professor of the @entity42 at @entity25 , worked with @entity43 , a research affiliate in @entity14 's @entity45 and @entity46 , to develop a system that identified settlements			2
the software scans for telltale signs including soil discolorations and the distinctive mounding that results from the collapse of mud - brick settlements			2
prof @entity24 used a computer to examine satellite images of a 23,000 square - kilometre area of north - eastern @entity5 , and turned up around 9,000 possible settlements , an increase of ‘ at least an order of magnitude ’ over what had previously been identified			1
prof @entity24 said : ‘ i could do this on the ground , but it would probably take me the rest of my life to survey an area this size			0
‘ with these computer science techniques , however , we can immediately come up with an enormous map which is methodologically very interesting , but which also shows the staggering amount of human occupation over the last 7,000 or 8,000 years			0
the sofware looks for distinctive mounds created by collapsing huts , and uses the traces to identify likely settlements ‘ what 's more , anyone who comes back to this area for any future survey would already know where to go			2
‘ there 's no need to do this sort of initial reconnaissance to find sites			0
this allows you to do targeted work , so it maximizes the time we have on the ground			0
’ the research was published in the @entity97 .			0

@entity14 software finds 9,000 settlements dotted across @entity5
satellite images scanned for telltale mounds and lighter *patches* of soil
could reveal clues to early *origins* of complex society
