we all know it ’s time to start panicking about @entity2 when the festive sandwiches hit the shops			1
every high street chain brings out their own version , but not all are created equal			1
in general , the fillings tend to follow two main themes — there ’s the meaty ‘ full works ’ roast dinner sandwich , which is usually turkey with bacon , stuffing and cranberry sauce , or there ’s the vegetarian cheesy number , more often than not embellished with some kind of spiced , fruit chutney			1
but are any of them any good ? and can anyone do anything different this year ? i pitted some of the main players against each other to see who ’s king of the festive sandwiches in 2014			1
@entity28 & @entity29 , £ 3.99 @entity31 breast , pork , sage and onion stuffing , festively fruity cranberry sauce , smoked bacon , rich gravy , spinach and crispy onions on rustic ciabatta			1
fat : @entity42 sugar : @entity44 calories : 477 this has a vaguely christmassy taste , but is rather bland ; odd considering there are so many fillings			1
the main detectable flavour is the stuffing , which is the common curse of @entity2 sandwiches — nothing else really stands up to it			1
i can find no evidence of any ‘ rich gravy ’ or ‘ crispy onions ’			1
overall , it has a sort of strange manufactured smell to it , a bit like you ’ve used a new appliance but forgotten to take the plastic cover off first			1
4/10 @entity67 with @entity68 , £ 3.95 @entity69 , mature @entity70 , @entity71 , tangy cranberry sauce and baby leaf spinach on seeded stone - baked sourdough ciabatta			1
fat : @entity76 sugar : 7.5g calories : 515 i ’m not sure this bread quite knows what it is ( anyone heard of a seeded ciabatta before ? ) , but i know what it is n’t — the right choice for this sandwich			1
it crisps up on top , yet is unpleasantly soggy around the edges			2
i also have to subject the filling to serious scrutiny before i detect any @entity70 or @entity71 inside			2
it ’s basically just a @entity94 and cranberry toastie with spinach that frankly , tastes a bit like it ’s ‘ on the turn ’			2
2/10 @entity98 , £ 3.65 @entity31 , cranberry sauce , pork , sage and onion stuffing , smoked ham , reduced fat mayonnaise and salad leaves on multi-seed bloomer			2
fat : 19.5g sugar : 15.7g calories : 583 this is a very generously - filled sandwich with distinct layers that look really rather pretty for a pre-packed effort			2
i particularly like the fact that @entity98 has done away with the usual flabby cold bacon , and replaced it with ham ; a wise decision			2
sadly it does succumb somewhat to the @entity119 in that it tastes mainly of stuffing and cranberry sauce — but if you ’re into both of those then this is ahead of many in its field			2
a point for improvement : as ever with eat sandwiches , the bread could be fresher			1
6/10 @entity31 , @entity29 and @entity133 , £ 2.29 @entity31 , smoked bacon , pork stuffing and cranberry chutney on malted bread			2
fat : 11.7g sugar : 6.7g calories : 426 a basic approach , this ; just turkey meat , stuffing and chutney			2
not a leaf or extra in sight			0
the turkey here is formed into small chunks rather than sliced , which makes for a crumbly filling that is rather unpleasant to eat			0
as for the bacon , it ’s just offensive : limp , and greasy			0
there ’s an odd chemical sagey back note to the stuffing			0
overall , i get the sense that a pile of @entity2 leftovers has been mixed together to make this filling			1
1/10 @entity162 ’s @entity161 , £ 3.60 free - range turkey , crumbly pork stuffing , cranberry and port sauce , crispy onions , spinach and mayo on malted bread			0
fat : 20.3g sugar : 11.1g calories : 540 i like how @entity162 has tried to do something different by adding the crispy onions , which do bring a pleasing textural contrast , but they have such an overwhelming flavour it ’s all i can taste while i ’m eating — and also for about three hours afterwards			0
they even trump the stuffing — quite an achievement			0
it ’s all a bit sweet , too			0
to be honest i feel for @entity162 with this one , as overall the ingredients are fresh and you can sense it ’s made the effort			0
for once , however , this falls a step behind its big @entity191 rival , eat			0
5/10 @entity193 ’s @entity192 , £ 3.50 one prawn mayo sandwich , one turkey feast sandwich ( turkey , malted bread , chestnut and thyme stuffing , mayo , cranberry and apple chutney ) and one mature cheddar and caramelised red onion and mayo sandwich			0
fat : @entity207 sugar : @entity209 calories : 643 i think @entity193 ’s is running with a three - course @entity2 dinner idea here ; prawn ‘ cocktail ’ to start , traditional @entity2 dinner as a main course , and cheese to finish			1
shame none of them are any good			0
the prawn mayo is really fishy and stale tasting			0
there ’s quite a generous fill on the turkey feast , but like the @entity226 ’s version , it has unappetising small chunks of turkey meat inside			1
the stuffing reigns supreme once again , and it all just tastes a bit old			0
the cheese is partnered with some very sweet red onions			0
meh ! 2/10 @entity234 and pigs in blankets on sage and onion bread , £ 3.50 @entity240 pork sausages and bacon , @entity240 roast butter basted turkey breast , cranberry chutney , spiced mayonnaise and spinach on sage and onion bread			0
fat : 23.8g sugar : 14.1g calories : 552 i really like the idea of the sage and onion bread , which is a lovely way of incorporating that stuffing flavour , without over powering everything else			0
also , pigs in blankets have got to be one of the best bits of @entity2 dinner			1
the bacon here is better than in any other @entity2 sandwich i ’ve tried and the cranberry sauce is n’t sickly sweet			1
it ’s generous , satisfying and meaty — the best of its kind by miles			0
