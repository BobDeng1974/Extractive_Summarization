many people are worried about the potential health effects of man - made chemicals sprayed on crops			0
but now there ’s a more natural alternative from an unlikely and very small source			0
@entity9 inventors have created an ‘ @entity15 ’ that is part fish tank and part herb box and will use fish waste as a natural fertiliser to help herbs and cherry tomatoes housed above the fish tank grow rapidly			1
the dirty water containing fish poo is pumped up into the grow bed where the plants grow on the rocks , with all the fertiliser and nutrients coming from the fish			1
herbs and small fruit and vegetables such as cherry tomatoes , peppers and strawberries can be grown in the bed			2
the plants work as a natural filter and clean the water			2
dirty water containing waste is pumped into the ' grow bed ' to feed the plants , which in turn clean the water in the fish tank below			1
‘ we believe that local farming is the first step to deliver fresh tasty fruits and vegetables , ’ said the inventors , who are currently raising funds on crowd funding website @entity52			0
‘ with this goal on mind , @entity57 has started to develop a product line based in aquaponics			0
’ aquaponics is a food production system that combines conventional aquaculture , of raising aquatic animals in tanks , with hydroponics - cultivating plants in water			1
the inventors , who are based in @entity71 in the @entity9 , describe their @entity15 as ‘ a symbiotic environment where the waste of the fish is used as a natural fertiliser and the plants clean the water			1
’ ' you can grow fresh food with the tiniest amount of effort			0
the only thing you need to do is feed the fish			2
' it may seem to some people like a neat solution for something that aquarium owners have been doing for years – watering their plants with dirty water from their fish tank			1
the inventors , who are based in @entity71 in the @entity9 , describe their @entity15 as ' a symbiotic environment where the waste of the fish is used as a natural fertiliser and the plants clean the water			1
' illustrations of the @entity15 are pictured many people have reported on internet forums that their houseplants have thrived faster than normal by using the fishy water			2
' i wanted to see how well the water from my tanks would do as a fertiliser and the results are stunning , ' one person wrote on @entity109 , while another said : i 've used my tank water for years			2
better than any fertiliser i ever used			0
’ the @entity15 costs from € 85 ( £ 68 ) in @entity114 and the kit will include a fish tank , grow bed , pump , stones and gravel , seeds to get them started			1
the product will be made using injection moulding			0
the company expects to start production in november and to ship the tanks just in time for @entity128 , if it managed to raise the money needed			0
the team has so far raised € 2,155 ( £ 1,717 ) and have a target of € 125,000 ( £ 99,603 ) .			0

the @entity15 is part fish tank and part herb box . it *'s* been invented by a team in @entity71 , the @entity9
it uses fish waste as a natural fertiliser to help herbs and cherry tomatoes housed above the fish tank grow rapidly
dirty water containing waste is pumped into the ' grow bed ' to feed the plants , which in turn clean the water in the fish tank below
it is a type of hydroponics - cultivating plants in water
