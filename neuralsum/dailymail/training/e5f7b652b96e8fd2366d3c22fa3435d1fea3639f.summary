@entity3 , the new high streets minister , said it would be ‘ wholly wrong ’ for the government to try to ban junk food from town centres			1
instead people had to take responsibility for their own diet , and not eat junk food ‘ three times a day ’			1
the coalition has faced repeated criticism for opting to strike voluntary ‘ responsibility deals ’ with food and drink firms instead of imposing bans or levies			2
three years ago @entity30 suggested he could enforce a ‘ fat tax ’ on products like pizza and processed food to limit the impact on the nation ’s health			2
but mr @entity3 warned it would be ‘ socialist ’ to force the fast food chains off @entity11 ’s high streets			1
the likes of @entity42 's and @entity43 are big employers and have come to dominate high streets because people choose to eat there , he added			1
‘ @entity48 kept having a go at fast food places when actually @entity42 's , @entity43 … those kind of places , whichever your fast food place of choice is , are massively important , ’ he told the @entity47			1
‘ they are massive employers , they are not coming to the high streets to annoy us			0
they are coming to the high streets because we all go to @entity58 , or whatever our personal taste is			0

’ ‘ if we want to get people eating more healthily then we have to educate people around that and the obesity issue			0
’ ' massively important : @entity3 said fast - food chains like @entity42 's and @entity43 are good for @entity11 it would be ‘ wholly wrong ’ for ministers in @entity74 to ‘ to try and dictate ’ where people eat			1
they are valuable businesses , ’ he said			0
last week the government faced criticism over a ‘ responsibility deal ’ to cut saturated fat levels in food			0
@entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 were among the firms to sign up to the commitment			0
but professor @entity88 , president of the @entity89 , said the approach ‘ lacked credibility ’ .			0

@entity3 says it would be ‘ socialist ’ to dictate firms opening in town centres
*insists* people should take responsibility themselves for what they eat
