the smell of success : the intrepid @entity3 sliding into my train seat , i discreetly whipped out the bottle and applied a few judicious squirts			1
the man sitting opposite looked up			2
‘ mmm , that ’s nice , ’ he said as the fragrance wafted under his nose was it my imagination or was that a cheeky twinkle in his eye ? as a single mum , one week shy of my 40th birthday , i had invested heavily in the new @entity19 range of pheromone - based products in a bid to succeed where dating sites had resolutely failed			1
the magic ingredient in their @entity26 body wash ( £ 25 , @entity27 ) and molecule 01 perfume ( from £ 39.50 @entity27 ) is @entity29 , an aroma - chemical which , despite sounding like an engine oil , is said to mimic human pheromones — the chemicals which make us attractive to the opposite sex			1
in his new book , @entity36 , professor @entity37 explains how smell is genetically paramount in how attractive we judge a prospective partner			0
buoyed up by the science , i swapped my usual £ 1 lemon shower cream for the £ 25 @entity19 body wash			1
it has a woody , almost masculine aroma			1
on the way to my first meeting i caught the attention of a portly man in his late 50s with slip - on shoes and a garish shirt — precisely the type of man i would usually swerve to avoid in a bar			1
he wandered over and engaged me for 15 minutes in lively chit - chat			2
when we parted he gave a little nod and wink but , although proof the pheromones were doing their job , he was n’t exactly the kind of mate i was hoping to attract			1
my meeting was with a male colleague to discuss a project			0
although he is married with three children — a total no - go area — it seemed a waste not to preface our platonic lunch with a squirt of the perfume			1
it had little effect but when i got up to leave , he kissed my cheek politely and said : ‘ oooh , you smell lovely			0
’ the new @entity19 range of pheromone - based products , which contain @entity29 , an aroma - chemical which is said to mimic human pheromones i spritzed on some more before the school run in the hope of luring the attention of single dads collecting their children			1
but aside from one fellow mum wrinkling her nose , the scattering of dads did n’t even give me a second glance , or sniff			0
later , i unleashed some more pheromones before my eveing date			2
i arrived at the bar and went for the direct approach			0
‘ do you like my perfume ? ’ i asked , as we sat down and our legs brushed			2
he pressed his nose against the bare skin on my neck and nodded			0
at last , a man reduced to a rubble of desire as advertised			0
‘ @entity114 , ’ he said			0
‘ just like an old routemaster bus			0
online dating , here i come again .			0
