by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 28 april 2012 updated : 20:08 est , 28 april 2012 when notorious mafia boss @entity2 was seized from a secret bunker by police last december after 16 years on the run , jubilant police could be seen cheering and making the v - sign			1
now it appears the threat posed by the gangster who is serving a life sentence for murder has not gone away , and he is communicating with his fellow gang members through coded letters			2
crime author and mafia expert @entity14 made the claim after analysing a hand - written letter addressed to @entity18 , the former head of the @entity22 's @entity21 clan , which was intercepted by investigators			1
victory : @entity26 police arrested @entity2 last december after 16 years on the run			2
he was the most senior boss of the @entity22 mafia still at large in an analysis for the @entity26 daily @entity31 , @entity14 says the letter uses ' cryptic and allusive ' language and ' a real construction of coded messages ' to give information about how the restructuring of the clan , its activities with other crime groups , and its contact with corrupt politicians			2
he cites the sentence : ' the friends are going on holiday and they took the home - made jam and they say ' hi ' , ' and says this probably means that clan members are due in court but will keep their mouths shut			1
they thought it was all over : @entity26 policemen were jubilant after @entity18 's arrest last december			0
now a letter to him suggests he is being kept informed of developments within the notorious @entity21 clan the line ' we 're all well and the children are growing up ' could well refer to appointments and promotions that followed the jailing of senior clan members including @entity18 , says @entity14			0
@entity18 is nicknamed @entity67 , or ' twisted head ' , in a reference either to his violent reputation or his asymmetrical features			0
' at the market we filled the car with fruit ' could refer to arms , hand grenades being commonly known as pineapples , or to lucrative dealings in large fruit and vegetable markets , which are often run by mafia clans			0
@entity83 even asserts that a line about ' @entity85 in his gallery ' appreciating ' everything that he 's heard ' could allude to @entity88 , a former junior economics minister of @entity89 , who some mps want arrested over his alleged links to the @entity22			1
control : @entity95 in the 1972 film @entity93 immortalised the mafia 's notoriety mr @entity14 admits that despite being an authority on the @entity100 mafia – he has lived under armed guard since the publication of his best - selling book @entity104 : @entity26 's @entity105 – much of his interpretation of the letter is speculation			1
he said even the recipients might not understand the contents of such letters until subsequent events – such as arrests or killings – provide meaning or context			1
however what was not in doubt was that @entity22 members used a complex system to ensure their words could not be used against them in court , he said			0
the clan , notorious for its violence , is heavily involved in supplying drugs to the @entity105 in @entity127 and has alliances with @entity130 mobsters and @entity132 crime syndicates .			0
