more than 11,000 amendments have been proposed in @entity2 congressional history , but only 17 have been added to the @entity3			1
if some of the thousands of amendments had been approved , life as we know it in @entity2 would change radically : there would be no president , @entity2 would declare their allegiance to the @entity2 of @entity11 , and it would be illegal to get a divorce			0
as numbers show , though @entity15 and the states can change the @entity3 through the amendment process , it 's very rare			0
the @entity3 ( left ) was created in 1787 and went into effect in 1789			0
the @entity20 ( right ) and its first ten amendments went into effect in 1791			2
since then , 17 amendments have been added one failed proposal , for example , came in 1893 from @entity2 representative @entity26 from @entity27 , who said that @entity2 should change its name to ' the @entity2 of @entity11 ' , according to @entity29			0
' it is possible for the @entity32 to grow through the admission of new @entity34 until every @entity35 on @entity11 has become part of it , ' @entity26 , who was n't nominated for a second term , suggested			0
1876 : a three - person , @entity39 - style triumvirate should replace role of president 1876 : eliminate the @entity42 and @entity43 1876 : forbid religious leaders from occupying a governmental office or receiving federal funding 1893 : rename @entity2 the ' @entity2 of the @entity11 ' 1893 : abolish the @entity47 and @entity48 1894 : acknowledge that the @entity3 recognizes @entity49 and @entity50 as supreme leaders in human affairs 1912 : marriage between races should be illegal 1921 : divorce should be illegal 1916 : put all acts of war to a national vote			2
any ' yes ' voter has to register as a volunteer for service in the @entity47 1933 : limit income to $ 1million - all excess goes toward lowering national debt 1936 : allow @entity2 people to vote on whether or not country should go to war 1938 : forbid drunkenness in all states and @entity2 territories 1947 : income tax for individuals should not exceed 25 per cent 1948 : give the right of citizens to segregate themselves from others 1971 : @entity2 citizens should have the alienable right to an environment free of pollution source : @entity80 an amendment , first proposed in the 1880s , that would regulate marriage and divorce was introduced to @entity15 every year for about 60 years			1
former president @entity85 , too , lobbed to give @entity15 power over divorces without passing an amendment			0
and one 1921 amendment tried to eliminate the idea of divorce entirely			0
' @entity15 shall have power to establish and enforce by appropriate legislation uniform laws as to marriage and divorce : provided that every state may by law exclude , as to its citizens duly domiciled therein , any or all causes for absolute divorce in such laws mentioned , ' the proposal read			2
in 1876 , a citizen named @entity102 proposed to @entity15 that the role of the president be eliminated and replaced with a three - person , @entity39 - style triumvirate			2
that same year , residents of @entity107 , @entity108 , suggested an amendment that would eliminate the @entity42 and @entity43			0
@entity111 records show that they were upset because the @entity42 ' always advanced the interest of the money , railroad and manufacturing speculators to the prejudice of the common welfare '			0
and in 1933 , @entity2 representative @entity118 , from @entity119 , proposed that excess income for millionaires making more than $ 1million per year be put toward lowering the national debt			0
a 2005 proposal - the @entity124 - came within one vote of passing @entity42 in 2006 after the @entity126 had approved it			1
the @entity127 , which guaranteed the rights of states that legalized slavery to keep ' persons held to labor or service by the laws of said @entity135 ' , was approved by @entity15 in 1861 , but it was not ratified by the states			2
to become part of the @entity3 , an amendment must be proposed by two - thirds of the @entity42 and @entity126 or by two - thirds of the state legislatures in what 's called a constitutional convention			1
for the proposed amendment to then be approved , three - quarters of the state legislatures have to vote to ratify it			1
@entity26 ( left ) proposed that @entity2 change its name to ' the @entity2 of @entity11 ' in 1893 because he believed the nation could take over every nation on @entity11			0
though @entity85 ( right ) never proposed an amendment to make divorce illegal like many others did , he lobbied to give @entity15 power over the subject for an amendment to become part of the constitution , it must be first proposed by two - thirds the @entity42 and @entity126 or two - thirds of state legislatures			1
it then is up to the states to approve the proposal			0
three - quarters of the states must vote to ratify it for the amendment to become valid @entity2 @entity126 member @entity166 proposed an amendment that guaranteed the rights of states that legalized slavery to keep ' persons held to labor or service by the laws of said @entity135 '			1
it was passed by @entity15 in 1861 but failed to ratify a few proposed amendments came close to ratification , including the @entity178 , the @entity179 and the @entity180			1
but since the @entity20 , the first ten amendments passed in 1791 , 99 per cent of the amendments have n't made it through the congressional approval or constitutional convention , of the 17 that have made it through the process , one has already been repealed â€“ the 18th amendment , which established @entity190			1
the 27th amendment established in 1992 , the last to be passed , barred @entity15 from giving itself a pay raise during the current season			2
in today 's 113th @entity15 , many proposed amendments focus on balancing the governmental budget and allowing campaign financing			1
others include outlawing same - sex marriages nationally , imposing limits on @entity42 and @entity126 terms , repealing the 22nd amendment that limits the presidency term and eliminating the 16th amendment and income taxes .			1
