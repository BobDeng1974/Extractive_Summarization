in the reality game of fantasy football being played out at @entity3 this summer , it has become the £ 150million question : just which of his stars will @entity6 drop when they are all fit to start ? the surge of optimism around @entity10 during sunday ’s win over @entity12 was almost palpable , such was the transformation in @entity15 ’s team			1
but it has also highlighted the embarrassment of riches he has accrued during a summer spent throwing money at the transfer market			1
four goals to the good and he was still able to summon @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 off the bench			2
@entity29 ( left ) could struggle to make it into the @entity3 team following @entity25 's arrival it is not a problem that will concern @entity15			1
‘ it ’s easy , ’ was his response last week when asked how he will accommodate them all			0
nor are the fans likely to complain about a sudden sprinkling of stardust after witnessing their club ’s alarming decline into mediocrity			0
but for the expensive squad now assembled at @entity10 , there are bound to be a few bruised egos in the weeks ahead and nowhere more so than in attack , where the arrival of @entity49 and @entity25 has upped the ante dramatically			1
it is generally accepted that @entity15 simply can not shoehorn all his stars into the same team — @entity54 , @entity25 , @entity55 , @entity29 and @entity56			1
something , or somebody , has to give			0
@entity49 celebrates scoring his first goal for @entity3 on his home debut against @entity12 the man who appeared to be most under threat in the new order was @entity56			1
@entity15 was certainly under no obligation to select a £ 37.1m signing who arrived at the club four months before he took over and , with the new manager looking to inject more pace into the team it was suggested that the @entity71 might actually slow @entity3 down			1
four games into the new season , and it would appear that @entity56 has an integral part to play in the @entity77 role			0
deployed at the top of a midfield diamond on sunday , he provided the link between midfield and attack and weighed in with @entity3 ’s fourth goal			2
it was @entity56 ’s eighth in 10 @entity87 games , which is remarkable for a player brought in primarily to provide assists			0
so who will be the odd man out ? it is highly unlikely to be @entity54 , who showed just why @entity3 broke the @entity93 transfer record to sign him for £ 59.7m from @entity94 , or @entity55 , installed as captain by @entity15			1
@entity25 has yet to play a full 90 minutes since rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last january , but it will be hard to omit the @entity100 star when he is fully fit			1
@entity56 's form - he has scored eight goals in 10 @entity87 games - puts @entity102 's place under threat amid the wave of euphoria on sunday , it was overlooked that the @entity110 did not actually play very well			2
in fact , he has not played particularly well for @entity3 for some time			2
the striker credited with tipping the title balance in @entity3 ’s favour after he arrived from @entity115 two years ago , faded under @entity117 last season			1
the highlight , a @entity120 hat - trick against @entity121 , was followed by news that he would miss six weeks with a knee injury			0
it was not enough to prevent @entity102 from playing for @entity15 at the @entity125 and scoring that spectacular diving header against @entity127 in the opening game , but doubts persist that he has fully recovered and his early - season form has done little to dispel them			0
he posed little threat to @entity12 at @entity10 , apart from when a moment of brilliance from @entity54 left him with a clear sight of goal , but he fired straight at @entity137			2
@entity102 ( right ) struggled during the 4 - 0 victory over @entity12 and was outshone by his @entity3 team - mates when @entity15 was confirmed as @entity3 ’s new manager , it was assumed that his fellow @entity110 would be an automatic first choice , if not for the captaincy as well			1
@entity102 missed out on that honour and is now in serious danger of being squeezed out of the line - up			0
at 31 , few would argue that his best years are behind him			0
@entity15 is unlikely to shirk the issue , as @entity149 team - mate @entity148 acknowledged after making an impressive debut			2
‘ he ( the manager ) is very honest to everybody — that can be frightening , but i like it , ’ said @entity148			0
‘ he knows what he wants and he knows his philosophy			0
’ @entity148 and @entity102 were pictured on saturday night enjoying a @entity157 meal with @entity25 in @entity158			1
how much longer @entity102 can keep his place at @entity3 ’s top table remains to be seen .			0

@entity3 have an embarrassment of riches after spending £ 150million this summer
@entity25 , @entity49 and @entity148 all arrived at @entity10
@entity6 must drop one of his stars when all are fit to start
@entity110 @entity29 could be the man to miss out
