better late than never for @entity0 , who on thursday produced what he considers his best round of a dreadful year at the penultimate tournament of the season			1
a dusted - off putter from better times made the difference , leaving him second in the @entity9 after an eight - under - par round			1
by his own four - letter description , @entity0 ’s 2014 campaign has been woeful , with injuries , a missed cut at @entity15 , @entity17 rows and an underwhelming @entity18 by his standards			1
in that time his world ranking tumbled from 12th to 44 , leaving him in danger of slipping out of the top 50 for the first time since september 2006			2
but thursday afternoon there were signs that the 38 - year - old was somewhere close to his best , following a sixth - placed finish in @entity27 last week with a sublime round of seven birdies , an eagle and only one dropped shot			1
@entity0 insists he is ' feeling right now ' after a year in which he has ' played s * * * ' as he moves second @entity34 leads the @entity9 on nine under par , a shot ahead of @entity0 he cited the new @entity38 clubs he switched to after the @entity18 as well a putter he unearthed from the @entity40 , in which he finished third			1
‘ i ’d played s * * * all year , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ there ’s no other word for it			2
there was nothing good coming out of 2014			0
‘ it ’s been tough to take , it really has			0
i thought i was doing the right things at the start of the year and took a massive step backwards with injuries and trying to play through them is not good			2
‘ that ’s a horrible spiral to be in when you ’ve got two tour cards to make sure you maintain			0
thankfully i ’m feeling right now			2
’ @entity0 ( left , taking an approach shot on the 11 and right , his reaction to the shot ) is second on eight under par @entity0 added : ‘ i am having a boost at the right time			1
sometimes you get a new car and it makes you feel good			0
i got new sticks in the bag			0
it felt great to be able to do that and that they worked really quickly			0
‘ when you get something new you are excited to use it			0
i have been excited for the last couple of weeks			0
i am happy with everything			0
’ @entity34 led by a stroke on a day that all but eliminated @entity74 ’s chances of snatching the race to @entity76 from @entity77			1
the @entity78 needs to win here and in @entity76 next week while hoping @entity77 finishes outside the top five when he returns in the desert			2
but a level - par round of 72 left the @entity18 player nine shots behind @entity34 , while the other two race contenders in @entity85 and @entity86 were horribly off the pace , shooting rounds of 75 and 77 respectively			1
meanwhile , @entity89 insists it is still bidding to host the 2022 @entity18 , a day after announcing their withdrawal over environmental concerns			0
@entity92 ' @entity74 is now highly unlikely to catch @entity77 in the race to @entity76 the @entity78 had a poor day and will hope to recover at in @entity94 over the next few rounds			1

@entity0 sits second at @entity9 after first round
@entity34 leads on nine under par , one shot clear of @entity0
@entity0 says he ' is feeling right now ' after a year in which he **'s** ' played s * * * '
@entity74 **'s** hopes are all but over in @entity93 to @entity76
