an @entity1 hashtag is allowing parents around the world to share their children 's weird and wonderful letters to @entity6 , with this year 's requests including everything from ' two packs of gum ' to ' a princess castle '			1
the festive tag # lettertosanta also showcases a number of notes from kindhearted youngsters whose only wish this holiday season is for those less fortunate than them to receive something nice from @entity6			1
' finally i have been waiting for @entity21 to come all year , ' one young girl called @entity19 wrote in her letter			1
' i hope that the poor people will be safe			1
one young boy called @entity29 , who clearly has incredibly expensive taste , lists a variety of ornate jewels and precious gems on his list , before asking @entity6 to help make his sister feel better			1
' this is what [ i want for ] @entity21 , ' he writes			1
' crystals and diamonds and a gold ring with red rubies and a big blue crystal and a big bit of gold and blue rubies			1
' and i hope my sister gets better			1
' and an electric guitar and a saxophone			1
' in an adorable letter to @entity21 , one youngster asks that he find a friend for his stuffed animal @entity43			1
' what i would like most for @entity21 is a friend for my stuffed animal called @entity43 who 's a penguin , ' the letter explains			2
' because @entity43 feels a bit lonely			2
he would like a friend who looked similar to him			2
' bow - led over : how could @entity21 refuse this rather passionate plea for new color - coded accessories ? keeping it simple : this list features just one item , a magazine what a flirt : @entity86 signs off her ornate letter to @entity6 with an affectionate ' love you silly boy ' others are much more specific about what they would like to find under the christmas tree this year , with one young girl requesting nothing other than ' new bows ' in her letter			1
' @entity98 , hello ! ' she writes			2
' i hope you have the most excellent @entity21			2
this year , i need some more bows			2
' first of all , some of my bows do n't even match my clothes			2
that is a big deal to me			2
' i had bows since i was a baby			0
i believe i need some more bows			0
' another eager letter writer has made @entity6 's job even easier this year , listing just one simple item on his @entity21 list : a magazine			0
other children are happy to give old @entity98 the chance to be a bit creative with his gift giving , asking him to choose something that he thinks they might like			0
' @entity118 ( @entity6 ) , ' young @entity86 writes			0
' i want to wish you a @entity120 ... may i have two packs of gum and other sorts of stuff			0
' she signs off at the end of the letter : ' love you silly boy			0
' strict instructions : some of the letters featured incredibly detailed suggestions about how @entity6 might best go about delivering the gifts we just ca n't let it go : frozen merchandise featured prominently on a number of lists , including this letter which includes an @entity141 doll and an @entity141 water gun ' i have been very good ' : many of the children are sure to explain to @entity6 that their behavior throughout the year has been well above average then there are the children whose letter come with very strict instructions about how @entity6 should deliver their gifts - and there are even those who include warnings about what will happen to him should he fail to get them what they ask for			1
one child explains : ' dear @entity6 , i have a stocking			0
if you bring a lot of stuff , use the big stocking			1
if you bring not so much , use the little one			0
' unsurprisingly , merchandise from @entity167 's hit animated movie @entity168 was high on a lot of children 's lists , with princess @entity141 dolls , @entity174 costumes and @entity176 teddies all included in this year 's letters to the @entity178			1
rather surprisingly , a number of the letters featured do n't include any requests at all - but rather include lovely stories and anecdotes which the authors wanted to share with @entity6 in order to brighten up his holiday - or in some cases to explain away any bad behavior which might land them on the naughty list			1
feed the world : @entity191 wants nothing more than to ensure anyone without food is given some this @entity21 spinning a small tale : one young girl just wanted to share her thoughts on her @entity198 , named @entity199 , and thank @entity6 for allowing him to stay with her fight club : although this youngster admits to fighting with her brother @entity203 on occasion , she insists that , underneath it all , they love each other dearly ' @entity209 , i am very happy with @entity210 , he is the best elf ever in my opinion , ' one child wrote , referring to the popular @entity21 toy the @entity198			0
' he is very fun			0
thank you for letting me have him			0
' every morning i have fun looking for him			0
he is a sneaky elf and i like that ... ' he is not too hard to find and not to easy , he is just right			0
' another child adds : ' dear @entity6 , how are your reindeer ? how are you feeling ? i have been very good this year			0
