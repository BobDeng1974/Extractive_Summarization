with love letters strewn across the floor , a gown hung in the bedroom , and black - and - white photos under a film of cobwebs , it looks like a scene from a fairytale			1
but this derelict dairy farm standing in the depths of the @entity13 countryside is a real - life mystery			1
dubbed the ' @entity16 ' , it is filled to the brim with personal belongings - including a floor - length red satin dress and love letters			1
but there has been no sign of life within these walls for 40 years			2
the picture shows @entity46 , who appears in other images around the house dust : the years of dereliction are betrayed by the living room which has a thick layer of dust on the floor			2
nobody knows why newspapers and notes are left scattered the four - bedroom house , officially called @entity59 , in @entity28 , @entity60 , @entity61 , was grade ii * listed in 1953 - more than two centuries after it was first built as a dairy farm			1
but according to census records , the owner , @entity46 , died in the early 1970s and her home became a forgotten relic within its leafy surroundings			1
however , her belongings have stayed exactly as she left them			2
now , a series of haunting images by photographer @entity26 has unveiled the mysterious manor , showing how generations made it their home over centuries			0
@entity79 : the eerie dairy farm , dubbed ' @entity16 ' , has been left to crumble away for decades			1
it is filled with letters and pictures that seem to be unspoiled vintage : a rusted 1970s @entity85 stands in the garage by the main house			2
it is the kind of car that would fetch thousands at an auction today personal : letters and photographs left behind in the manor show a woman named @entity46 lived there			1
@entity97 has gathered but the shots are clear and mystical ancient : the building maintains its original architecture from 1725 with heavy wood doors , stone floors , and high ceilings			1
few people have visited the site since the 70s crumbling : plants tumbling through ceilings , torn curtains and crumbling walls only serve to enhance the building 's ethereal and timeless beauty life : handbags , ribbons and clothing strewn about the house give little glimpses into the mysterious world of women that lived here years ago dust - covered glass bottles of 19th century cleaning products such as turpentine and black lacquer look like works of art in the sunshine gleaming through the cracked windows			1
floral 1950s wallpaper tumbling down the walls reveal the heavy stone that was used to build the house in 1725			0
now , after years of neglect , nature has moved in			0
branches and leaves hang through the ceilings and soil is spilling out of the fire place on to a 1960s television			0
mr @entity26 , 28 , from @entity143 said : ' i heard stories of the manor and so wanted to investigate for myself			0
' the picture of a lady in a red dress and the actual red dress still being there was particularly intriguing			1
i wanted to see what else was inside			0
' i felt like i was in someone â€™s home uninvited , i expected the owner to walk round every corner i saw			0
@entity158 era : delicate bottles of turpentine , black lacquer , and healing oil were the cleaning products of yesteryear			0
they are a far cry from today 's plastic decades : a box of @entity169 alongside older cleaning products , 1950s curtains , and an 18th century wooden window frame shows how this manor was home to generations decorative and mysterious : floral curtains and mis - matched floral wallpaper frame the leafy @entity13 countryside through broken glass , as a lone shoe sits on the sill ' when i climbed the stairs to enter the main bedroom , i opened the door and to the right there was a photo of the lady in the garment on her dressing table with all her makeup and other personal items on it			2
' i then turned to the left and saw an open wardrobe with that red dress hung up , it was a very eerie feeling as if someone was there			1
' i thought it was her at first glance			0
' battered : the window panes are broken , the curtain is pulled across the room , and there are clothes scattered			0
but no sign of why or where the inhabitants went details : the beautiful and dolled - up @entity46 also passed her county examinations at the @entity215 , according to framed certificates clutter : frames pictures lean against a typically 60s television before two small chairs with bags and pillows across the floor , and soil spilling out of the fireplace beautiful : it is a moment in time frozen and unspoiled			2
the mustard walls and art deco ornaments suggest a long history of family in the abandoned manor mr @entity26 explained his project as an exploration of ' beauty in decay ' : ' the lady in the red dress has been identified by census records and personal letters as @entity46			1
' i am documenting things that someone once cared about			0
' people are amazed to see the pictures , especially when they see it 's a place with personal belongings in			0
