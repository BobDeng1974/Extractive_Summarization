@entity0 has emerged as an force to be reckoned with in @entity3 's midfield of late , and @entity4 says @entity5 will be drawing up a special plan to stop him			1
@entity7 face @entity3 at @entity8 on saturday in the @entity9 and both @entity11 columnist @entity4 and his fellow @entity13 pundit @entity12 believe @entity5 will bring @entity14 into his midfield to neutralise @entity0			1
the @entity17 centre back started in the middle of the park in last month 's @entity21 final and has become an emergency option for the league leaders in that unfamiliar role of late			0
@entity0 has emerged as an force to be reckoned with in @entity3 's midfield of late @entity4 believes @entity5 will bring @entity14 into his midfield to neutralise @entity0 @entity4 and @entity12 agreed that @entity5 would have a special plan to stop @entity3 's run of form @entity4 and @entity12 were speaking as part of @entity30 ahead of @entity31 vs @entity32 but with @entity3 on such good form , having won their last six league games , @entity5 will need to find a way to put a stop to @entity38 's team and @entity4 and @entity12 see @entity0 as the main target			1
@entity4 sees the special one retreating into his shell with a midfield incorporating @entity14 , @entity43 and @entity44 as they look to deny @entity0 and the rest of @entity3 's midfield that they have thrived in			1
' @entity5 very rarely gets done tactically in a big game			2
his record is fantastic , ' @entity4 said			2
' there 's no doubt , he wo n't go in with just his normal set - up , he 'll use something different			0
i 'm convinced of it			0
' @entity5 very rarely gets done tactically in a big game			2
his record is fantastic , ' @entity4 said @entity0 could be targeted by @entity5 in midfield as he looks to find a way of stopping @entity3 on saturday @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity14 ( @entity62 ) could all be involved from the start in the game at @entity8 @entity14 has emerged as an emergency option for @entity7 when they need strength in the midfield area ' i think there 's a case for bringing @entity14 into midfield , maybe get him on @entity0 , because @entity43 is left - footed and he wo n't want to put him on the right side of central midfield			1
' i imagine he will maybe play @entity44 instead of @entity75 and tuck him right in to fill spaces around there			0
( @entity5 will ) play @entity14 as more like a third centre back , but slightly ahead of ( @entity12 ) @entity60 and ( @entity61 ) @entity61 just to look after @entity0			1
' i 'm convinced he wo n't allow the space and the problems they cause down that left side to happen			0
he will set up and stop it , i 'm convinced of it			0
' @entity5 will not want to give @entity3 space and that means that he will set up to stop them , says @entity4 @entity44 was also picked out as a potential player to be used in midfield , with @entity75 missing out @entity12 agreed , and went as far as to say that @entity5 would focus on ' destruction ' before hoping to win by taking advantage of set - pieces or the skill of @entity93 in his analysis on @entity30			1
the former @entity3 captain also made it clear that while he expects @entity5 to have a plan for the game , he does not see his charges winning their next three games against @entity3 , @entity101 and @entity102 to take the @entity9 title at the earliest possible opportunity			1
' i think he 'll just think destruction first and foremost , he 'll think how i 'm going to stop them and then how i 'm going to win the game , ' @entity12 said			0
@entity12 commented on how @entity5 would be focused on ' destruction ' , having @entity14 ' sacrificing himself ' ' i think @entity14 coming in is a good point , it will be alongside @entity43 in midfield			1
@entity14 will sit a little bit to the right and just sacrifice himself in the game			2
' that will then give them ( @entity118 ) @entity117 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity14 , @entity43 , ( @entity120 ) @entity119 potentially , and he 'll think : " i can win this game either by a bit of magic from @entity93 or by set - pieces "			2
he 'll play the long game			0
' his team are n't playing very well , @entity3 are playing better than them at this moment in time			0
but he 'll stop that pattern on the left - hand side and more often than not , when he pays attention to things , he does			0
