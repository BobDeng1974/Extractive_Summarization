and believe me , you constantly think about getting caught , but the rush is worth the risk			0

there was the @entity67 man who wrote to @entity3 , an author who published the inmate 's grotesque letters , and a newspaper columnist and editorial board who brought the case to the attention of @entity25 gov. @entity74			1
the @entity75 promptly signed the death warrant even though more than 40 other men have been on death row longer ; @entity3 is set to die april 12			1
' those letters are so disturbing and so insightful into who this person is ... , ' said @entity82 , who recently published some of the letters in his book ' @entity86			2
' ' @entity3 , actually , he talked his way into the death chamber			1
' @entity3 also wrote about picking up @entity62 , 17 , and a 14 - year - old friend , who were hitchhiking near the beach on july 26 , 1983			1
through the years : @entity3 has been on death row since 1984 ; his execution date has been pushed up to april 12 in part because of the graphic boasting in his letters pen pal : in a series of letters , @entity3 detailed the specifics of his horrific crimes strangely polite : @entity3 said in one letter : ' please feel free to ask any question you want about anything			1
you can not offend me in any way ' @entity3 and his cousin , @entity108 , took them back to @entity3 's home , where the girls were bound			1
@entity108 left , and @entity3 raped both			1

the board asked @entity74 if he had considered signing @entity3 's death warrant			1
the governor promised to look into it			0
meanwhile , letters poured into @entity74 's office , many of them mentioning the correspondence			1
more victims : @entity3 was convicted of killing 14 - year - old @entity170 , left , and @entity171 , right , who was 35 neater : he also typed up letters to pen pals outside of prison ' @entity82 provides compelling evidence that @entity177 relishes every detail of his heinous murders , ' wrote @entity180 , whose nephew was married to one of the women killed			1
about a month after the editorial board meeting , @entity74 signed @entity3 's death warrant			1
a spokeswoman for @entity74 said he had not read the book			2
@entity3 's attorneys are now appealing , arguing in part that the governor 's decision to sign the warrant was unfairly influenced by the editorial board			2
@entity194 , who was friends with ms @entity196 , credited friends and relatives of the victims for continuing to press for @entity3 's execution			1
' the timing of the book just happened to work out perfectly			0
that is the bonus of the book , is that it gave all of us more ammunition and more fire to see this through to the end , ' ms @entity194 said			0

' he was hearing that i used him , ' mr @entity13 said			0

he 's opposed to the death penalty			2
' i told him that i did not actively pursue it			0
that there 's a lot of people - because you did some really , really bad things - there 's a lot of people that hate you and they want to see you executed and they used these letters to get people 's attention as to the horrible crimes that you committed , ' mr @entity13 said			2
similarly , @entity82 is n't taking credit			0
' the only person you can blame is @entity3 himself			2
his candour and his lack of compassion , empathy and remorse is stomach churning , ' he said			0
@entity3 corresponded with mr @entity13 and others for some time - most of the letter 's contents are too graphic			1

' oh and you can believe , i collected hair			0
it took a couple days to recover from that			0

in another letter , @entity3 described his uncontrollable desire to kill			2
' it 's sort of along the lines as being horny			0
you start getting horny and it just keeps building until you have to get some relief , ' @entity3 wrote			2
' that is the same with the urge to kill			0
it usually starts out slow and builds and you will take whatever chances necessary to satisfy it			0
and believe me , you constantly think about getting caught , but the rush is worth the risk			0
' in yet another piece of correspondence , he described what it was like to open up his victim 's stomach			0
' at the drop of a hat , or ( sic ) slip her stomach open and not think nothing of it			0
once i sliced open her stomach , i ’d reach in and pull her intestine and all out			0

i ’ve probably seen things even drs. have n’t seen : ) '			0
