children learn better when taught in mixed classrooms rather than single - sex schools , the head of @entity1 has said			1
sir @entity5 said a mixed school was more ' congenial ' and that putting working - class boys in single - sex schools to try and improve their performance would be a ' nightmare '			1
this is despite the fact single - sex schools tend to perform better in academic league tables and exams			1
he told the @entity27 : ' i was head of an all - boys school			1
we did all right , but i much preferred being head of a mixed school			1
girls and boys mix socially in the workplace			0
they should be educated together , too			0
' @entity36 do better in a mixed - school setting , as long as it is a well - run school			2
a mixed - school setting is by far more congenial			2
' and his comments were supported by @entity42 , the head of leading girls ' school @entity44 , who said single - sex classes were ' hyped up a lot '			1
@entity42 , the head of girls ' school @entity44 , said single - sex classes were ' hyped up a lot ' she told the @entity49 : ' i think if you create a really great environment then pupils do well			1
i do n’t sell a school on it being single - sex … i sell it on the fact that we set out to be excellent in all that we do and that ’s why you should choose us – not because it is an all - girls school			1
' asked if the benefits of single - sex schooling were overblown , mrs @entity42 said : ' personally , i do , yes			1
' mrs @entity42 , who previously worked at the co-educational @entity65 , said working in an single - sex school ' was a complete non-issue ' when it came to improving the performance of pupils			1
' the girls that i had in my house there did brilliantly , " she said			0
" the girls i have here do brilliantly			0
' she added : ' i think there are lots of divides in this country			0
we talk about independent v state , boys v girls – they are all children			2
we just need to work out how to teach children and how to get the best out of each child rather than which school they are in			2
' just 250 fee - paying schools were wholly catering for either boys or girls in the last academic year , down from 460 in the early 90s			2
of those , around 150 are all - girl			0
on a separate issue , sir @entity5 also advised parents to stop their children having a mobile phone until they were 13 and removing televisions and computers from their bedrooms			1
he suggested that pupils should also be banned from bringing their phones to school			1
he said : ' mobile phone technology is part of the issue of low - level disruption in classrooms			0
social media is part of the problem ... it seems sensible to ban mobile phones from schools , then you do n't get kids texting each other in class			2
' his comments come after a report by @entity1 , the schools watchdog , last week which found children were losing up to an hour of lesson time each day because of disruption			0
he was also keen to play down his public spat with former education secretary @entity127 , which led to the chief inspector hinting at a ' dirty tricks ' campaign against him by officials at the @entity133			0
he said : ' that issue is well and truly over			0
the thing about @entity127 was that he was a reformer who believed passionately in what he was doing			0
' he will go down as one of the great secretaries of state			0

he has been a *headmaster* at both a single - sex and mixed school
says it would be a ' nightmare ' to put working class boys in all boys school
@entity42 , head of @entity44 , says single - sex education over hyped
sir @entity5 also suggests pupils be banned from bringing phones to school
