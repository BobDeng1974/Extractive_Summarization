but a lawyer representing one of those potential whistle - blowers is insisting that the @entity2 is stonewalling congressional requests for their testimony			1
the @entity18 announced earlier in the day that it will convene a hearing on may 8 aimed at ' exposing failure ' in the @entity4 administration to respond o security threats to that diplomatic mission , and to present to the public and to @entity11 an accurate version of the attack that left @entity6 ambassador @entity26 and three other @entity6 dead			1
' this administration has offered the @entity6 people only a carefully selected and sanitized version of events from before , during , and after the @entity9 terrorist attacks , committee chairman @entity31 , a @entity32 congressman from @entity33 , said in a statement wednesday			2
' not surprisingly , this version of events casts senior officials in the most favorable light possible			0
and in an october 2012 hearing , it produced evidence contradicting the administration 's initial claim that the the sept. 11 , 2012 military - style assault on the diplomatic compound began as a ' protest ' sparked by a low - budget @entity62 video that lampooned the @entity65 prophet @entity64			2
' next week ’s hearing will expose new facts and details that the @entity69 has tried to suppress , ' @entity31 said			0
at least four surviving witnesses to the @entity9 attack have retained attorneys to help them navigate the process of testifying before @entity11 about what they saw			1
they are all employees of the @entity76 and the @entity49 , according to a @entity78 report			0
the @entity6 @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 was attacked and burned on sept. 11 , 2012 in a military - style attack that killed the @entity6 ambassador and three other @entity6 @entity33 @entity81 > @entity31 ( @entity82 ) has announced a hearing in which the @entity18 , which he chairs , will hear testimony from survivors who say they have been blocked from telling @entity11 what they know			1
@entity88 rep. @entity87 ( r ) has promised that the @entity9 attack is ' not going away despite the efforts of this [ @entity4 ] administration ' attorney @entity91 said tuesday that she is representing one of them , a man who has been cowed into silence under threats of damage to his career			1
president @entity4 denied on tuesday that he was aware of any @entity6 personnel who were being prevented from sharing their observations with congressional investigators			2
' i 'm not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying , ” the president said in response to a reporter 's question , ' so what i ’ll do is i will find out what exactly you ’re referring to			2
' both the @entity76 and the @entity49 have told @entity11 that no employees have requested the security clearances that their lawyers would need before talking to @entity11			2
and on wednesday , @entity4 's chief spokesman @entity1 insisted during a @entity2 press briefing that ' @entity9 happened a long time ago , ' and that ' we are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before @entity11 to provide information related to @entity9			1
' attorney @entity91 represents a survivor of the @entity9 attack whom she says the @entity4 administration has blocked from testifying by refusing to give her the necessary security clearance to learn what her own client knows but @entity91 , a former @entity126 official and @entity32 counsel to the @entity128 , told @entity78 that administration officials are issuing ' some very despicable threats to people ... they 're taking career people and making them well aware that their careers will be over ' if they testify			1
the @entity49 , she said during a separate @entity78 interview , has ' had two letters from chairman @entity31 , one on april 16 , the other one april 26 , that specifically say , " we want you to provide a process for clearing a lawyer to receive classified information			0
" ' ' how can they possibly get up there and just lie to the press corps ? ' she asked , referring to the president and his spokespersons			0
@entity91 , according to her law partner who was interviewed wednesday on @entity148 affiliate @entity147 in @entity149 , already possesses a @entity151 clearance , and would only need a letter from an administration attorney in order to learn what her client already knows			2
that law partner , former @entity6 attorney @entity157 , explained on monday that ' the @entity49 is refusing to grant clearances to @entity159 and other people who want to represent the whistle - blowers , in an attempt to prevent the testimony			1
' the @entity164 released these photos on wednesday of individuals who sere seen near the @entity9 consulate on the day @entity10 terrorists attack it , killing four @entity6 including the @entity6 ambassador			1
the raid on that diplomatic outpost happened eight months ago @entity2 @entity32 issued a scathing report on april 23 criticizing the @entity4 administration for a series of intelligence failures and an attempted cover - up after the @entity9 raid			1
when then - secretary of state @entity180 testified before @entity11 , she disputed that it was important to determine whether the raid was carried out by terrorist militants or by an angry group of protesters , as the administration first claimed ' on april 26 , congressman @entity31 sent a letter to the new @entity187 , @entity188 , demanding that the lawyers who are going to represent the whistle - blowers be cleared - be given clearances - so they can talk to their clients and the committee about classified information , ' @entity157 said			1
' she got a new @entity151 security clearance within the last year			0
and now they will not clear her or any of the other lawyers to represent the @entity49 people			0
' ' there is going to be a @entity203 showdown here , ' he predicted , ' and ' @entity11 is going to win			0
the administration 's effort to cover up whatever happened in @entity9 is going to fail			1
' ' the whistle - blowers are out there , ' @entity157 insisted			1
' these are great @entity6			0
they were on the ground in @entity9			0
they want to tell their story and the administration is going to do everything it can to stop them from testifying under oath in public			0
and they want to protect @entity180 [ @entity218 ] and the president			0
that 's what this is all about			0
' @entity223 @entity32 rep. @entity87 , who serves on the @entity18 , said wednesday that he was ' not at liberty to disclose the identity of the witnesses ' who will appear at next week 's hearing			2
' @entity9 is warming up , ' @entity87 promised during a televised interview			0
' it is not going away despite the efforts of this administration			0
' @entity157 , shown here in a file photo , said @entity9 survivors ' want to tell their story and the [ @entity4 ] administration is going to do everything it can to stop them			2

@entity241 insisted that no government employees were being blocked from testifying about the 2012 @entity9 consulate attack
four survivors have retained lawyers to help prepare their testimony , with at least one attorney saying her client 's *superiors* *threatened* him
the @entity18 will hear their testimony on may 8 , *forcing* the @entity4 administration 's hand
president @entity4 has *professed* *ignorance* of any effort to prevent whistle - blowers from telling @entity11 about the night terrorists attacked
