mr @entity0 will say : ‘ i want to help families and pensioners with the cost of living			0
’ the spending commitment , to be funded from ‘ underspends ’ in @entity68 , comes as a surprise after repeated government claims that there is no room in the public finances for tax cuts			1
the @entity75 has said the top rate of tax should be cut to help growth the body wants the 50 per cent income tax rate for the highest earners to be scrapped ' to kill the perception that the @entity83 is a high - tax country '			1
it also wants corporation tax to be slashed from 26 per cent to 15 per cent by 2020 to create more jobs			0

he also called for spending on infrastructure projects to be protected and for the @entity112 to announce a return to quantitative easing for the first time in nearly two years on thursday by injecting a further £ 50 billion into the economy			2
the chancellor is also thought to be planning to use more unspent money from @entity70 departments to inject into capital projects to try to kickstart the flatlining economy			0
both mr @entity0 and the prime minister will insist the cash can be found without deviating an inch from the government ’s tight deficit reduction plans			1
as the @entity2 started in @entity127 yesterday , @entity48 said there were ‘ elements of truth ’ to the idea that @entity83 was in the economic equivalent of a war			1
he said the debt crisis engulfing the eurozone was a threat not just to the @entity83 economy but that of the entire world			0
the prime minister ruled out any u-turn on spending cuts , but went out of his way to suggest that he understood the ‘ shocks ’ to family finances			1
‘ we have got to explain to people there is something better at the end of this , ’ he declared			2
‘ i think one of the biggest shocks for people has been the electricity increases , the gas increases			0

‘ we are doing the right thing , but we ’ve got to explain all the time why it ’s necessary , how we ’re going to help people			2
’ council tax in @entity167 doubled under @entity168 , with the average bill for a @entity171 home rising to £ 1,439 a year			1
huge rises : the council tax rate for a @entity171 home doubled under @entity168 to £ 1,439 a year in other developments at the @entity2 conference : the government has been under pressure from @entity2 mps to complement austerity measures with a coherent strategy for growth and measures to put cash in the pockets of hardworking families			1
up to two million council houses could be sold to their tenants under plans to revive @entity191 ’s ‘ @entity190 to buy ’ scheme			1
ministers are to offer heavy discounts – worth up to 50 per cent – to persuade people to buy their homes			2
the proceeds will then be ploughed back directly into building new houses in the area			0
@entity48 suggested yesterday that the new drive could result in another 100,000 homes for rent being built , creating 200,000 jobs			2
right to @entity204 was one of the most popular policies of the @entity191 era			2
discounts of up to 60 per cent were offered , encouraging some two million tenants to buy their council homes between 1980 and 1998			1
although the scheme continued under @entity168 , the level of discount was capped by @entity214 at a maximum of £ 38,000			0
last year just 3,690 homes were sold under the scheme			0
communities secretary @entity218 said local authorities would be required to replace every council house sold on a ‘ one - for - one basis ’			1
and he said limits would be set to ensure that council tenants in fashionable areas were not turned into overnight ‘ millionaires ’			1
mr @entity48 also announced that thousands of acres of publicly - owned land are to be released by the government for house building , which has fallen to the lowest level since the 1920s			1
the prime minister insisted : ‘ we are firing up the engines of the @entity83 economy			1
‘ there is a step change taking place right now			0
this government is not just sitting back			0
’ aides said the chancellor will use his address to the conference today to accept that the cost of living is ‘ the big issue ’ for most families			2
but he will insist that the deficit reduction plan is more important than ever , given the debt crisis overwhelming countries such as @entity249			0
a resolution to the turmoil in the eurozone , he will say , would be the biggest single boost to confidence in @entity83			0
the chancellor will insist that he has a longer term plan for growth , highlighting his plan to cut corporation tax to the lowest level in the @entity262 group of leading nations			0
he will also confirm that the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims is to rise from one to two years , as the @entity266 revealed last week			1
last night mr @entity0 announced plans to set up new enterprise zones to deal with the fallout from the decision by defence giant @entity271 to slash 3,000 jobs in the north of @entity167			1
the zones will encourage firms to expand or relocate to the @entity271 sites at @entity277 and @entity278 , in @entity279 , and @entity280 , in @entity281			2
@entity282 , @entity168 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ @entity48 is so out of touch with what ’s happening to jobs and the cost of living that he seems more interested in protecting a plan that is n’t working than protecting our economy			1
‘ with unemployment rising and the recovery choked off last autumn the prime minister is stuck with the old lines and has nothing new to say			1
’ warning : lord @entity295 says @entity48 must convince voters over the budget deficit if he is to win an outright majority in the 2015 general election @entity48 must do more than convince voters he is right about cutting @entity83 ’s towering budget deficit if he is to win an outright majority at the next election , lord @entity295 warns today			1
the former deputy party chairman and polling guru says it is clear that @entity2 support has held up since mr @entity48 entered @entity309 , despite economic turmoil and unpopular spending cuts			2
many voters have decided that @entity313 is ‘ weird ’ , lord @entity295 ’s latest research shows , and the prime minister remains far and away the best - rated of the three main party leaders			1
the proportion of 2010 @entity2 voters staying with the party who give mr @entity48 very high marks for his performance has actually increased over the year , the peer says in an article for the @entity266			2
but while conservative voters back the @entity330 ’s focus on the deficit and are relatively ‘ sanguine ’ about cuts , those whom the party needs to win over to gain an outright victory in 2015 are more concerned about the impact on public services			1
lord @entity295 argues that mr @entity48 must demonstrate that deficit reduction is part of a broader economic strategy for restoring growth			2
floating voters see the deficit as part of a range of issues to be dealt with , including tackling crime and improving schools and @entity347 ’s poll of 8,000 adults showed people feel ‘ uncertain ’ and ‘ anxious ’ about the economy , and were not confident @entity83 would be in a better state even in three or four years ’ time			1
the rising cost of living , he said , was a recurring theme			0
the @entity354 is widely thought to be suffering because of budget cuts , though in fact the @entity330 has protected its budget			0
voters also said they hoped for a tougher approach to immigration from a @entity2 - led government , but were not clear that it was being delivered .			0
