@entity1 chairman @entity0 told mps he was ' very ashamed ' by the bank 's conduct @entity1 could face a criminal probe in the @entity7 over claims that its @entity10 private bank helped wealthy clients evade tax , it emerged yesterday			1
investigations into the @entity15 banking giant have already been launched in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity10 and the @entity18			1
yesterday @entity20 boss @entity19 signalled that an inquiry into the scandal could now take place in @entity7			1
she told mps on the @entity25 a ' multi agency ' meeting next week would assess if it was possible to ' pursue wider offences '			2
the @entity28 , the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity34 crime agency @entity33 would attend			2
the move paves the way for a criminal investigation in the @entity7 into @entity1 and its clients			1
@entity20 has come under fire for prosecuting just one person from a list of 3,600 @entity1 customers with @entity10 bank accounts handed to it by @entity16 authorities in 2010			1
yesterday @entity46 , @entity1 ’s chief executive since 2011 , and chairman @entity0 were summoned to give evidence to the @entity25			1
appearing in public for the first time since the scandal emerged earlier this month , mr @entity0 admitted the bank had ‘ suffered horrible reputational damage ’ and said he felt ‘ very ashamed ’ by what happened			1
@entity1 has been rocked by a string of controversies , including @entity59 mis - selling , interest rate derivative mis - selling , foreign exchange manipulation and violation of international sanctions			1
mr @entity0 said : ' it is a terrible list ... one of the most humbling things that has happened in my career is a recognition of all the things you did not know , and you go and say " what could i have known or what should i have known ? " ' ' what these instances have illustrated or brought to the fore is that allowing interpretation at 88 countries as it was at the time is the wrong way to go and we should centralise control			1
' mr @entity46 also told @entity24 the revelations had caused ' damage to trust and confidence ' in the company and apologised for the @entity10 private bank 's ‘ unacceptable practices ’			2
the chief executive - who has worked for @entity1 for 35 years - told @entity24 : ' i would like to put on the record an apology from both myself and @entity0 for the unacceptable events that took place at our private bank in @entity10 in the mid- 2000s			1
' chief executive @entity46 told @entity24 on the treasury select committee that the revelations had caused ' damage to trust and confidence ' in the company he added : ' it is an apology we would like to make to you , our customers , our shareholders and the public at large			0
' it clearly was unacceptable			0
we very much regret this , and it has damaged @entity1 's reputation			1
' asked precisely what he was apologising for , mr @entity46 went on : ' the lack of controls and practices which now - judged with the benefit of hindsight - we would not be at all comfortable with if they were happening today , and which have clearly resulted in damage to trust and confidence in @entity1 and created further reputational damage to our firm and have therefore hurt clients , customers , shareholders , our staff and people at large			1
' but he immediately came under fire for his own personal finances , following revelations he paid around £ 5million of bonuses into a @entity10 bank account via a @entity134 holding company			0
@entity25 chairman @entity135 questioned why mr @entity46 ‘ felt the need ’ to put in place such ‘ extraordinary arrangements ’ , which lasted between 1998 and 2009			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 said the bank faced a ' terrible list ' of controversies , including @entity59 mis - selling and foreign exchange manipulation mr @entity46 admitted the scheme will look ‘ strange ’ to the general public			1
but there was ‘ no tax advantage ’ and it was set up purely to keep his bonuses secret from colleagues			0
the @entity151 - born 55 - year - old added : ‘ i myself grew up in @entity153 , i went to a state school so i can understand how the public perceives these issues			0
’ mps also questioned why mr @entity46 is domiciled for tax purposes in @entity159 , despite being posted back to the @entity7 by @entity1 in 2003			2
he said he and his wife intend to move back to @entity159 when he retires as chief executive and added that he had spent most of his 35 - year career with @entity1 in the former @entity7 colony			2
he said he has paid full @entity7 tax on his earnings since 2003			0
mr @entity135 told him : ' you 've said you 're trying to clean everything up			0
some years ago , you were certainly muddying the waters with these extraordinary tax arrangements , were n't you ? ' @entity1 is having to weather yet more controversy after the @entity18 named it as one of the banks it 's investigating over the possible manipulation of precious metals markets the @entity1 chief executive replied : ' i can understand how people find these arrangements kind of unusual			1
i myself grew up in @entity153 , i went to a state school , so i can understand why the public would find them unfamiliar and rather strange			0
' mr @entity46 said he left the @entity7 in 1980 with the intention of spending his career overseas , and had made his home in @entity159 and set up the @entity134 ' nominee entity ' in 1998 to channel his pay from the bank			0
' there was no tax advantage or purpose whatsover to the @entity134 company			0
it was a @entity134 nominee entity constructed purely to give me privacy within my own company , ' he said			0
' at that point in 1998 , my compensation was not a matter of public record			0
when i became a director of @entity1 in 2008 , my compensation became public and that structure was wound up in 2009			2
' it was purely about privacy from colleagues in @entity159 and @entity10			0
we had a computer system back in the day that allowed everybody to inquire into staff accounts ... i was amongst the highest paid people and i wished to preserve my privacy from colleagues			0
' but @entity216 mp @entity215 said : ‘ you yourself with your own tax affairs look like you ’re at the outer limits of aggressive tax avoidance			0
do you think you have the moral authority to carry on this change process at @entity1 ? ’ mr @entity46 responded : ‘ i believe the changes i have made to the firm clearly demonstrate the sincerity of my desire actually to change @entity1			2
’ efforts to clean up the bank were stepped up after @entity1 was fined £ 1.2billion in the @entity18 in 2012 for laundering money for @entity232 drugs gangs			1
asked by @entity234 mp @entity233 whether he accepted the public expected ‘ atonement ’ for these latest transgressions in @entity10 , mr @entity0 said ‘ absolutely ’			2
but he pinned the blame on executives who led the @entity1 private banking operation during the time in question			2
he said @entity246 and @entity247 – son of four minute mile legend sir @entity249 – ‘ certainly bear a fairly direct responsibility for what went on in the private bank during their stewardship ’			0
this week the bank disclosed profits slumped by 17 per cent last year .			0

@entity1 chairman @entity0 said he was ' very ashamed ' by events
@entity20 boss @entity19 said a *multi-agency* probe could now take place
