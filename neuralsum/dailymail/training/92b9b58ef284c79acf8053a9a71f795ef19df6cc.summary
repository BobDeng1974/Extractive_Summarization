by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity1 her @entity4 cover may tell fans to ' remember her name ' - but @entity7 might be hoping they 'll forget her performance in the @entity10 semifinal game last night			1

' disappointed : @entity7 stands on the mound during the third inning of the game against @entity22 on wednesday night			1

she left the game after 55 pitches , meaning she can not play in tonight 's battle against @entity22 but will play if they reach the championships on saturday the loss comes after she captivated the sports world when she pitched a no - hitter last friday - a first for a girl at the @entity10			1
she is the 18th girl to appear in the tournament			0
she has also become the first @entity10 player of either gender to score a @entity4 cover - and wednesday 's performance puts her in good company			1

honor : the disappointing performance came after it was announced that she will become the first @entity92 - of either gender - to ever grace the cover of @entity4			0
it is due out august 25 @entity19 will take @entity96 on again on thursday , but she wo n't be pitching due to pitch - count rules			2
despite the disappointing result on wednesday , @entity37 still put in a solid performance , the @entity99 reported			2

' she 's a great pitcher			0
that triple in the first was huge and then she settled down			0

she then led @entity19 to a 8 - 0 victory over @entity124 in the @entity126 championship game			1
@entity26 appears on the @entity4 cover , with the headline ' remember her name , ' on the august 25 issue - not that fans , who have lined the grassy hills beyond the playing field at the @entity135 to see @entity37 play , really need to be told			2
impressed : although @entity19 took a bad loss , @entity22 ' @entity108 ( pictured on wednesday ) called her a ' great pitcher ' and said his team did well to win			1
@entity108 hit a triple in the game bad night : from left , @entity143 , @entity37 , @entity7 , and @entity144 wait on the dugout steps to the take the field for the sixth inning of the semi-final baseball game against @entity22 on wednesday the concession stands have sold out of the powder - blue t - shirts of her @entity153 team			1
and yet , in spite of her 70 mph fastball , baseball is n't @entity37 ' best game ; her basketball coach said she is even better on the hardwood			2
' coaching boys and girls in this age group for two decades , @entity26 is just a special talent , ' said @entity167 , @entity37 's basketball coach at @entity168 in @entity19			1
' she 's a phenomenal pitcher , but i think her best sport is basketball			0
in a year or so , she will be doing the same unbelievable things in basketball			0
the first couple of games i coached her , she was head and shoulders above any kid i 've ever coached at that age level			0
' @entity37 has not shied from using her riveting success in a positive way			0
she sacrificed time with teammates to do a national television interview late sunday night , and of course there 's the @entity4 cover .			0
