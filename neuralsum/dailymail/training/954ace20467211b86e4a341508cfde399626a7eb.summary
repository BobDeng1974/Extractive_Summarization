the blog post - called ' what i 've learned about women ' was posted on wednesday by @entity10 , a former student government president at the @entity11			1
his post begins by explaining just how much he loves women			1
he says : ' i love women , a lot			1
i love when they look at me , talk to me , and laugh at me			2
' however , it quickly takes a much darker turn when mr @entity10 says that if you take all a woman 's clothes off , she will be truthful with you			1
fury : college student @entity10 has sparked outrage by posting a sexist blog in which he says the only way to get a woman to tell the truth is to get her naked he said : ' the thing i love most about women and trying to convince them to kiss me is that at the core of it , if you can get a girl over to your place and somehow manage to have her take her clothes off , she will be truthful with you			1
' it is hard to lie to someone who is lying naked next to you			0
girls are lying all day long			0
they lie about their feelings , their weight , how much cardio they did , and what they think of their best friends oversized purse			0
' but at the end of the day , when i get a girl back to my place , she will tell the truth about what she wants to do when she grows up , what her family is like , what her city is like , and why she has that stupid oversized purse			0
' he then goes on to explain his ' rules for women ' in which he even attributes his own name to a quote			1
his blog reads : ' when you realise women make absolutely no sense , it all makes sense			1
' controversial : this is how mr @entity10 began his blog , which he called ' what i 've learned about women ' his other golden nuggets of information include ' your only goal is to have fun ' and ' stop trying '			1
mr @entity10 then helfully suggests to his readers that there are just three places you should look at a woman			1
he says : ' the first is her eyes , because you can tell if she is interested in you or not with the eyes			0
the second is her neck because it is the most sensitive part of her body and you want to check for an adams apple			2
' if she has one of those , she is most likely a man so you should avoid trying to sleep with her / him			0
' the third and most important place you can look at a woman is her toes			2
why ? because the toes tell all			2
if her feet are pretty and her nails are painted then you can assume the rest of her body is well groomed and cleaned			1
' sorry : mr @entity10 issued this apology following the outcry which his blog caused following this , he also offers flirting advice to his male readers			1
' so the best way to think about women and how to get them to be attracted to you is to do the exact opposite of what you think			2
' if you really like her , tell her you ca n't stand her			0
if you think she is pretty , make fun of her oversized purse and ask her if she keeps a parachute inside it			0
' if she is the nicest girl you 've ever met , tell her that you do n't like it that she is so mean to young children			2
seriously its so simple , do the opposite			0
' he says : ' the final piece of advice i have for talking to girls is to confuse them			0
foolish : mr @entity10 is a former student government president at the @entity11 , pictured ' honestly they deserve it , they have perplexed men since the beginning of time when they tricked us to eat the devil 's food in the @entity146			1
' give them a taste of their own medicine			0
if you can confuse their brain , then they will go home with you			0
again , i do n't know why and it does n't make sense but it just does			0
' following a storm of @entity160 outrage over his post , mr @entity10 took down the blog on thursday			1
as reported by the @entity163 , he said : ' i have removed the blog post because it cost me one of my closest friendships with a woman who in unlike any other on the face of this planet			2
' she has done more for me that anyone besides my mother			0
i offended her , i am ashamed , and i am sorry			0
