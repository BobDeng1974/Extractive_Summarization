@entity0 was accused of making excuses by @entity2 last night as he plunged plans for tv debates between party leaders into further chaos			1
the prime minister indicated he would take part in a head - to - head with @entity10 and a five - way clash adding mr @entity2 , @entity12 and @entity14 leader @entity13			1
but he appeared to reject broadcasters ’ demands for a third debate featuring only him , mr @entity10 and mr @entity2 , dismissing the @entity19 as a ‘ minor party ’			1
@entity0 , pictured , has said he wo n't participate in a three - way debate with @entity22 and the @entity19 during prime minister ’s questions , the @entity22 leader claimed mr @entity0 was ‘ frit ’ – a dialect word for ‘ frightened ’ once used by @entity28			1
mr @entity2 , sitting next to the prime minister , was seen to shout , ‘ excuses , excuses ’ at him , while @entity30 made a chorus of chicken clucking noises			1
but mr @entity0 accused @entity22 and the @entity19 of ‘ running scared ’ over the inclusion of the @entity37 , who are biting into the vote of both parties			1
@entity42 strategists said including the @entity37 – whose membership has doubled since september and is on course to overtake @entity45 ’s in weeks – was a ‘ simple matter of fairness ’ , given the party regularly outpolls the @entity19 and beat them in last may ’s @entity50 elections			2
broadcasting sources said that if the @entity37 were included , it would be difficult to refuse the @entity54 nationalists a place			0
with the @entity59 on course to win far more seats than @entity45 or the @entity37 , @entity54 ’s first minister @entity56 has threatened legal action unless her party is allowed to participate			2
during the last general election , then prime minister @entity62 , right , held a debate with @entity2 , left and @entity0 , centre , and tv companies want a similar format during the forthcoming campaign it is far from clear whether @entity22 would take part in a tv debate in which it could be undermined by the @entity37 in @entity72 and the @entity59 in @entity54			1
senior broadcasting figures are understood to have discussed whether to ‘ empty - chair ’ mr @entity0 if he refuses to take part , as @entity22 is demanding			2
@entity76 , the @entity77 ’s former editorial director , suggested it would be possible to leave a spare lectern where the prime minister would have stood			2
‘ those who are willing to put themselves on the line should be allowed to do so , ’ he wrote in the @entity81			0
‘ those who do n’t can watch at home and see what an empty chair looks like over 90 minutes of prime - time television			0
’ @entity90 says ‘ due weight ’ must be given to the major parties in election campaign coverage			0
but some senior broadcasters are concerned about the sway the regulator has over election coverage , after it declared earlier this month that it regards @entity45 as a ‘ major party ’			0
senior politicians suggest the terms of the tv debates should be negotiated by an independent commission , as with @entity104 presidential clashes			0
miss @entity13 last night wrote to mr @entity10 , mr @entity12 and mr @entity2			0
she revealed that @entity105 has not yet decided who should take part and urged the three leaders to agree that she should be included			0
@entity22 strategists have long been counting on the tv debates to boost their chances – and mr @entity10 said mr @entity0 was using the @entity37 as a ‘ pathetic excuse ’ not to take part			1
he said it was for broadcasters and ‘ not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate ’ , adding : ‘ however he dresses it up , everyone knows he is running scared			0
’ but mr @entity0 told @entity30 : ‘ i ’m all for these debates , but you can not have two minor parties without the third minor party			1
why is [ @entity10 ] frightened of debating the @entity125 ? ’ a @entity127 source said the @entity128 had made no final decisions about tv debates and various formats were still ‘ up in the air ’ .			0
