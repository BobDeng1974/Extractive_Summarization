by @entity1 reporter published : 20:41 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 02:23 est , 10 december 2013 a testy face - off between a ' @entity4 employee ' and a protester has now been revealed as a set up as the man who barked at the protester was a member of the same activist group			1
a local paper uploaded a video of a man getting off one of the private shuttle buses used by @entity4 to transport employees from @entity15 to the company 's headquarters about an hour 's drive away			1
on monday , a group of demonstrators stopped the bus , chanting that the company was one of the reasons why so many lower - income residents are being forced out of their homes in search of cheaper rent			2
' ' if you ca n't afford it , it 's time for you to leave , ' he continued			1
' if you ca n't pay your rent , i 'm sorry			1
' the man 's true identity , after only identifying himself at the scene as a @entity4 employee , was revealed later on monday as a union organizer by the @entity63			1
' this is political theater to demonstrate what is happening to the city			0
it 's about more than just the bus , ' @entity39 told the @entity63 after the jig was up			2
even though the protestor that @entity39 yelled at in the incident appears to be smiling - almost hinting that she may have been in on the joke - has said that she did n't know it was about to happen			2
she said she did n't even know who @entity39 was			0
out of the loop : even when the ' employee ' was identified as union activist @entity39 , the protestor remained committed to the fact that she , @entity81 , had no idea who he was or that it was a set - up ' no i did not know him , he did n't tell me that he was going to be doing that , ' said @entity81 , who heads the @entity86			1
@entity39 's group is fighting against the increasing inequality divide in the city which is forcing many out to the suburbs where rents are more reasonable			0
' i 'm really upset that this happened			0
we 've calculated about 11,000 no fault evictions since 1997 , ' @entity39 said			0
' these are enormous corporations that are investing in this community			0
these companies , like @entity4 , should be proud of where they 're from and invest in their communities			2
' watch the video here			0

a union organizer *originally* posed as a @entity4 employee when he got in a fight with a protestor
@entity110 told the protestor to ' go somewhere else ' if they could n't afford the rent in @entity15
ends up he was a union activist who fights for the same cause
