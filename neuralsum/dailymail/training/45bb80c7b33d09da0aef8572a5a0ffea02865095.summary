mr @entity36 , who took over the top power position yesterday , said an investigation into the crisis had been launched and he did not want to point fingers or speculate about the cause			1
other officials said the blackout might have been the result of states drawing too much power from the grid			0
some analysts dismissed that explanation , saying that if overdrawing power from the grid caused this kind of collapse , it would happen all the time			0
about 620 million people were left without electricity after @entity2 's northern , eastern and north - eastern grids failed yesterday afternoon in recent years @entity2 's demand for electricity has soared as its economy has grown			1

it was the second massive outage in as many days , coming just after the country had recovered from monday 's failure of the northern grid , which left 370 million people powerless			2
electricity workers struggled throughout the day yesterday to return power to the 20 affected states , restoring most of the system in the hours after the crash			2
the @entity130 said the two outages cost business hundreds of millions of pounds , though they did not affect the financial centre of @entity134 and the global outsourcing powerhouses of @entity136 and @entity137 in the south			0

the power minister cautioned there would be no quick solution to the power crisis , saying the government is looking at immediate and longer term measures to address power scarcity			2
part of the problem is that @entity2 relies on coal for more than half its power generation and the coal supply is controlled by a near state monopoly that is widely considered a shambles			0
collapsed : ' the north , northeastern and the eastern grids are down but we are working and we will have them restored shortly , ' @entity171 , said a spokesman at the @entity178 a huge traffic jam was witnessed near @entity180 more in the capital as traffic signals were not functioning following a massive power failure at northern grid a recent survey showed nearly all the coal - fuelled plants had less than seven days of coal stock , a critical level , and many power plants were running below capacity , according to @entity191 , head of research at @entity193 , a financial services company			2
government bureaucracy has made it difficult to bring more plants online			0
in addition , vast amounts of power bleeds out of @entity2 's antiquated distribution system or is pirated through unauthorised wiring			2
farmers , with a guarantee of free electricity that is driving many state electric boards to bankruptcy , have no incentive to conserve energy			0
the power deficit was worsened this year by a weak monsoon that lowered hydroelectric generation , spurred farmers to use pumps to irrigate their fields long after the rains would normally have come , and kept temperatures higher , keeping air conditioners and fans running longer			0
