hard as he tried to duck it , the issue of @entity2 ’s notoriously frosty relationship with @entity3 would not go away			1
@entity6 stonewalled , he bristled			2
he even offered up some grudging respect to his former assistant in an attempt to change the subject			0
but nothing could alter the fact that when @entity14 go to @entity15 on monday night , all eyes will be on the feuding @entity17 duo			1
intriguingly , @entity3 is one point and one place ahead of his rival going into their clash at @entity23 ’s			1
‘ that ’s more private i think			0
we play against @entity15 and we have to speak about @entity15 and not the trainer - coach			2
’ the two had clashed as players but their managerial fallout dates back to @entity6 ’s arrival at @entity29 as technical director 10 years ago when @entity3 was head coach at the club			1
@entity3 objected to @entity6 pulling up a chair in training and observing the session in the overbearing manner of a schoolmaster			1
in turn , @entity6 felt @entity3 was ‘ weak ’ in his handling of star players such as @entity51 , and blamed the coach for undermining him when he was ousted from the job a year later			1
two men who had previously worked well at @entity55 , and whose wives @entity57 and @entity58 had become best friends in @entity60 , were no longer on speaking terms			0
@entity6 ( right ) and @entity3 had run - ins with one another during their playing days in @entity64 the pair worked well together though at @entity55 when @entity3 ( right ) became @entity6 's assistant their relationship changed when working at @entity29 , where they brought a young @entity70 to @entity71 the pair ’s feud began when @entity6 was appointed technical director of @entity3 ’s @entity29 side in 2004			1
@entity3 took issue with the way @entity6 would get involved in training sessions , and @entity6 labelled his compatriot ‘ weak ’ and felt the need to step in to break up a fight between team - mates @entity51 and @entity83 during one of @entity3 ’s sessions			1
on the last day of the summer transfer window in 2004 , @entity6 accepted a bid from @entity88 for @entity51 , which angered @entity3 , who had no time to sign someone to replace him before the window shut			1
@entity6 claimed @entity3 ‘ engineered his departure from @entity29 ’ that same year , and declared : ‘ i ’ll never have dinner with @entity3 again ’			1
but @entity3 insists : ‘ that is his story			2
my story is different ’			0
in a 2014 biography @entity6 rekindled the bitter rivalry , stating : ‘ the real problem at @entity29 was @entity3 no longer had control over the group ( at @entity29 )			1
in principle , @entity3 should have solved that , but he could n’t			2
’ when @entity3 later succeeded @entity6 at @entity106 , the latter suggested that his replacement was third - choice on the club ’s list			1
more recently , it has been claimed that @entity6 took great delight in building a more expensive villa than @entity3 ’s in the @entity114 resort where they are sometimes neighbours			1
the @entity14 manager could not help but point to the difference in size and stature of their clubs yesterday when asked about the impressive job @entity3 and his brother @entity125 , @entity15 ’s assistant , have done on the south coast despite joining a club that had just offloaded some of their best players in the summer			1
@entity14 signed one of them , @entity132 for £ 28million , and were linked with @entity133 who ended up at @entity134 with @entity135 and @entity136			2
‘ @entity15 have a very good squad , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i know a lot of players and a lot of players were offered to us			0
but when @entity14 is coming , clubs are always asking more money and we have to pay because we are @entity14			2
‘ do you think @entity15 pay too much for players ? i do n’t think so , because they are @entity15			2
there is always a relationship between @entity149 and @entity14 and teams like @entity151 and @entity15			1
’ on reports that @entity14 are set to spend upwards of £ 100m to continue overhauling the squad the manager added : ‘ i think it ’s disgusting always writing about numbers			2
it ’s disrespectful to my players			0
’ and when asked about the depleted squad @entity3 inherited , @entity6 turned the question around			1
‘ i have heard that in the media , ’ he added			0
‘ do you know how many players we lost ? i have never read that			0
we have lost more players but @entity3 is a very good coach and i know he can do it			2
it ’s always surprising that a club like @entity15 are in that position but that ’s a matter of coach , players and staff and when you do that it ’s very good			0
they are able to finish in the top four but that ’s also because i believe in the management of @entity3 and his brother			0
when the cohesion is good he can manage			0
’ @entity14 have @entity179 ( left ) available for monday 's clash but @entity15 will be without @entity181 @entity6 will make the trip to @entity23 ’s with his captain @entity179 after confirming that the @entity184 striker has recovered from the knee injury that kept him out of wednesday ’s win over @entity187 at @entity188			1
@entity15 ’s midfield options are becoming stretched , with @entity181 facing at least six weeks on the sidelines			0
the 25 - year - old will not play again this year after sustaining ankle - ligament damage in the wednesday ’s late 1 - 0 defeat at @entity194			0
@entity181 ’s absence compounds an increasingly tough situation for the @entity15 in central midfield , with @entity198 and @entity199 also out of contention for monday ’s match with @entity14			1
@entity202 has helped fill the void in the past two matches but he is a doubt with a hamstring injury			0
@entity3 said : ‘ @entity181 has ankle - ligament damage and he will be out for maybe more than six weeks			0
@entity202 has fatigue in his muscle and is doubtful			0
’ the injuries mean 19 - year - old @entity211 could make his first @entity213 start alongside the likes of @entity215 and @entity216			0
‘ he is ready , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ he ’s a young player and he has to develop himself , but i ’m a manager at a club that likes to develop young players			0
’ @entity202 ( left ) is also a doubt for the @entity15 with a hamstring injury suffered against @entity194			0

@entity15 host @entity14 in monday @entity213 's clash
@entity14 boss @entity2 and his @entity15 *counterpart* @entity3 have had a *simmering* feud for over 10 years
the pair 's issues date back to when @entity6 was technical director at @entity29 and @entity3 was manager
