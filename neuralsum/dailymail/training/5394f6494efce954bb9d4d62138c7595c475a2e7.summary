by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 and his doomed squad limp on to @entity4 on monday , a city which has become synonymous with @entity7 embarrassment and humiliation in the lexicon of @entity11 football			2
sixty - four years ago it was a bunch of amateurs from the @entity14 who stunned the world and jolted @entity17 from its lofty status as a global power based on the fact it had invented the game			1
this time it is @entity23 limbering up to bring @entity17 down a further peg or two			1
the @entity27 top @entity25 having upset both teams who have won against @entity2 ’s side and they are not done yet			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity23 's @entity32 preview the @entity17 clash plucky minnows : @entity23 have upset both @entity35 and @entity36 and now have @entity17 in their sights motivated : assistant manager @entity38 says his players are playing for possible @entity40 moves @entity41 : @entity23 @entity38 , the @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 striker who is the assistant manager of @entity23 , warned that his players are inspired to beat @entity17 despite the fact they have already qualified for the last 16			1
the @entity47 are viewing their success in @entity49 as a passport to a better league , perhaps even the @entity40 , and at least a better contract , including their 61 - year - old @entity54 manager @entity53 , who is keen to move on and coach in @entity56 after winning titles in @entity58 , @entity23 , @entity59 and @entity54			1
@entity2 is planning several changes to his team , to give those players yet to feature the chance to say they have appeared in a @entity7			2
@entity23 will detect the blood of a wounded team anxious to get out of @entity49 without further calamity			1
shame : @entity17 lost 1 - 0 to the @entity14 in 1950 in @entity4 , still one of the countries ' worst defeats embarrassment : @entity2 and @entity70 know @entity17 need at least a point to avoid a humiliation to match 1950 ‘ the players want to impress the world by getting three points against a team like @entity17 , ’ said @entity38 , who is among those tipped to replace @entity53 if he leaves			1
‘ i know for sure the players want to do well and end up in the @entity40			1
even though we are through and they are out , beating @entity17 would still mean a lot to our team			2
‘ we know that we can go far at this @entity7			0
we have just beaten another world champion and we need to enjoy that and then , against @entity17 , we will definitely play to win because of all that it would mean			2
' we are not thinking about who we get in the last 16			0
it does not matter to us			0
we have been in a group with three champions of the world and we have shown that we can beat anyone			0
we are part of history			0
nobody would have put a single dollar on this team qualifying , but there you go			0
‘ it can change football in @entity23			2
these are the best days of my career			0
we are very satisfied and happy with what we have achieved but we will keep working to do more			0
’ all over : @entity107 's strike for @entity35 put @entity17 on the verge of going out , before @entity23 sealed it @entity109 hopes : @entity111 's @entity110 scored to put @entity23 in the lead against @entity35 in their first match @entity23 captain @entity114 , who scored the game ’s only goal against @entity36 , was hounded out of @entity117 last year , cheered and jeered from the pitch when he was substituted and hastily packed off on loan to @entity120			1
he has one year left on his contract at @entity122 but it is hard to see him returning to @entity117 following the club ’s relegation to the @entity126			0
having started to fulfil his huge potential on loan at @entity129 , @entity111 ’s @entity110 has another chance to prove to @entity131 that he might worth a chance at the @entity133			0
@entity23 will not be lacking confidence or motivation when they line up against @entity17 in the iconic @entity137 , home to @entity138 , the reigning champions of @entity49			1
it was not the same venue where @entity141 ’s team were beaten 1 - 0 by the @entity14 in 1950 — that was at @entity143 ’s @entity142 — but it is the same city and the parallels will haunt @entity2 and his team if they do not get out of @entity4 without a point , at the very least			2
@entity17 have never left a @entity7 finals without a point			1

@entity47 players want to earn a place in the @entity40
@entity17 must get a point to avoid their worst ever campaign
@entity23 claim they do not care who they face in next round
