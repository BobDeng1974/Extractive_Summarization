by @entity0 last updated at 12:57 am on 4th august 2011 a massive £ 35billion was wiped off the value of @entity3 ’s biggest companies yesterday as the global economy sunk deeper into crisis			1
stock markets around the world fell as the debt storm in @entity9 blew back across the @entity10 to @entity11 and threatened to engulf @entity12 and @entity13			1
panicked investors were also rattled by signs of a severe slowdown in the @entity9 , the world ’s biggest economy , as it edged closer to a double - dip recession			1
' bumpy ride ' : the @entity22 sank to it 's lowest point this year with a 132 point drop in @entity28 , the @entity26 index of @entity9 stocks recovered only slightly after falling for eight straight days			1
the loss of confidence on financial markets threatens to destroy momentum in the world economy and send unemployment soaring			1
a renewed global slump would be devastating for @entity3 and could tip the economy back into recession			1
the number of @entity3 who will never find work has risen by as much as half a million as a result of damage done during the recession , leading economists say			1
even when the economy has recovered around two million will still be jobless			1
research by the @entity46 and the @entity47 said unemployment has fallen in recently but is still at 7.7 per cent , or 2.45million			1
the @entity49 expects it to peak at 8.3 per cent next year			1
it estimated that so - called structural unemployment , which remains after the economy recovers , has risen from 5.2 per cent before the crisis to 6.2 per cent today			1
that means the number of permanently unemployed has increased from 1.66million to 1.98million			1
the @entity47 puts the figure at 2.18 million			1
in its last forecast in may it predicted growth of 1.4 % but it said today that weaker spending will ' hinder any meaningful recovery ' this year			1
@entity49 today repeated its call for ' a modest loosening in fiscal policy ' to improve prospects for output and employment			1
the @entity22 tumbled 133.88 points to 5584.51 – slashing the value of @entity3 ’s blue chip companies by £ 35billion			1
it is the worst fall for nine months			1
@entity71 ’s index of leading shares has lost £ 75billion of value in the past four days and is down more than 500 points , or £ 135billion , since its 2011 high in february			1
@entity75 , an analyst at broker @entity76 in @entity71 , said : ‘ everybody is phenomenally nervous			1
there is a lot of fear out there			2
’ the carnage in @entity71 was mirrored in @entity11 where the debt crisis sweeping the single currency bloc pushed @entity12 and @entity13 closer to the brink			2
more than £ 1.2trillion has been erased from the value of global shares in the past week amid concern the economic recovery is faltering			2
falls of this magnitude affect millions of families as well as investors because workers ’ pension funds are tied up in the stock market			2
@entity97 , chief market strategist at @entity98 , said : ‘ it has been an ugly day for shares			1
it is the now familiar double - whammy of sovereign debt and a stumbling recovery that has smashed sentiment once again			2
‘ it really is bounce or bust time for markets at the moment , but it is difficult to see what the positive news could be that pulls stock markets back from the brink			2
’ a succession of crises has battered the global economy in recent months , from violent uprisings in the @entity119 , to the earthquake , tsunami and subsequent threat of nuclear meltdown in @entity124			2
the @entity126 debt crisis that flattened @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 hurtled across the @entity10 to @entity9			2
the @entity9 was only saved from an unprecedented default by 11th - hour deal to raise the $ 14.3trillion debt ceiling on tuesday night			2
with political leaders heading away for their summer holidays , analysts warned the global economy faces its biggest crisis since the collapse of investment bank @entity138 in 2008			2
spooked investors : @entity141 's deal on the @entity9 debt ceiling has done nothing to instil confidence in the markets @entity146 , chief currency strategist at @entity147 in @entity71 , said : ‘ it feels as if the past few days have seen global markets reach a tipping point			0
’ it came as the @entity152 insisted the @entity9 is not in danger of a double - dip recession even though the services sector – which employs nearly 90 per cent of @entity9 workers – had its worst month for 17 months			0
@entity141 held an emergency cabinet meeting last night to discuss the economy			0
the president also admitted that wrangling over the country ’s debts has caused unnecessary damage			0
@entity12 prime minister @entity164 , 74 , last night tried to calm jitters that @entity12 was heading into the financial abyss , insisting the economy was ‘ solid ’			0
@entity11 leaders defended the single currency bloc amid fears that @entity12 and @entity13 will follow @entity127 , @entity129 and @entity128 towards collapse			0
@entity173 president @entity172 said the treatment of @entity13 and @entity12 was ‘ a cause of deep concern ’ and blamed the financial markets for the crisis – rather than towering debts across the @entity126			0
fading fortunes : the @entity22 looked like it was set for a summer of gains but is now heading for its lowest point in five months with more eurozone economies apparently set to follow @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 on the road to debt crisis , we ask how the euro is managing hold its own against the pound ? still strong : despite the financial turmoil in the @entity126 the currency itself is holding up well what is happening with the pound versus the euro ? the pound is currently worth 1.147euros , down from this year ’s high of 1.202euros , but above this year 's low of 1.107euros			0
the pound was last worth 1.30euros in early 2008			0
why is the euro so strong ? the euro is n’t so much strong – it is just not as weak as the pound			0
the severity of the @entity3 recession – compared to @entity206 and @entity207 - combined with the shock remedies of record low interest rates and quantitative easing , all served to weaken the pound against both the dollar and the euro from 2008 onwards			0
the dollar has recently been kept weak by the @entity9 debt crisis and the threat from the @entity217 of more quantitative easing			0
why do low rates and @entity220 weaken a currency ? higher @entity3 interest rates mean higher returns on assets that international investors hold in the @entity3 , so more money will flow into the country and more sterling will be bought on the global currency markets			0
quantitative easing , by flooding the economy with more money and increasing the supply of sterling , devalues the price of that currency in terms of rival currencies			0
but why has the euro - zone crisis not swung things back in sterling ’s favour ? with chancellor @entity244 unswerving in his commitment to cutting the @entity3 budget deficit , you might think that the worsening problems in several euro - zone economies would mean the pound should be in favour over the euro			0
but two things have worked against that			0
one , the commitment of the stronger euro zone economies like @entity206 and @entity207 to propping up the single currency and the ailing second - tier economies has shored up confidence in the euro			0
more importantly , the @entity259 has raised interest rates twice this year to 1.5 per cent , while the @entity261 has kept rates at a rock - bottom 0.5 per cent : this has opened up an interest rate gap between the @entity3 and the continent , which means investors ’ money is more likely to drift into euros			0
and the prospects for the rest of the year ? more of the same : the @entity259 has warned it is likely to raise rates again , while the outlook for @entity3 rates is that they will not go up until next year			0
if the euro , dollar and pound are all weak – who is strong ? the @entity280 franc has been the big beneficiary as a safe haven from the turmoil in the @entity9 and @entity11 recently			0
and over the last year or so the @entity285 and @entity286 dollars have done well .			0

@entity98 drops by 132 points to *5,585.74*
that is down *2.5* % after third consecutive day of drops
