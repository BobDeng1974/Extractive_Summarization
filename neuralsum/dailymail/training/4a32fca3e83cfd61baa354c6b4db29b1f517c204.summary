by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 should @entity3 ’s defence of his @entity5 title this coming fortnight be disappointingly brief then blame should not be laid at the door of his new coach @entity7			1
the reigning champion discovered on friday that @entity10 ’s @entity9 , a neat striker of the ball who looks like he might be the shy one in a boyband , will be his opponent when he steps out on to @entity14 at 1pm on monday			1
and in the unlikely event of the worst happening , he warned against using his mentor @entity7 as a scapegoat			1
‘ i could lose in the first round and it certainly would n’t be her fault , ’ said @entity3			2
it is silly to suggest otherwise			2
but what i can sense is whether i feel like things we are working on in practice are the right things , whether i feel like we communicate well , tactics and the way we talk after a match			0
‘ i have enjoyed the last few days			0
i do n’t think the first few ( at @entity44 ’s where he lost in the third round ) were the perfect place to start			0
‘ every time we were on the practice court and she stood anywhere near me there were the clicks of a hundred cameras			0
it is normal to be a bit uptight in those circumstances , especially as we did not know each other well at that stage			0
‘ since @entity44 ’s we have managed to get away from everything and spend some time together on court			0
i had dinner with her on wednesday night			0
i suppose the thing that has surprised me is that she has fitted in with the team very quickly			0
’ unlike what initially seemed to be the case 12 months ago , @entity3 ’s early draw looks relatively kind , although 23 - year - old @entity9 is someone whose natural talent exceeds that of his ranking of 104			1
he reached @entity5 ’s third round two years ago and defeated @entity72 , who had made the last eight at @entity74 months before			1
@entity9 will not blast @entity3 off the court but is a skilled opponent who is attractive to watch — it is to be hoped he does not become this year ’s @entity78 , the little - known @entity10 who took out @entity79 in the 2013 first round			1
team effort : @entity3 and his coaches share a joke during friday 's training session in @entity74 favourable draw : @entity3 will face @entity10 @entity9 in the first round of the men 's singles first up : @entity3 has been drawn to face @entity10 @entity9 in the first round at @entity5 @entity3 should face a relatively easy first week , although big - serving @entity89 would present problems			1
but to beat @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity79 in five days will be a considerable ask ... rnd possible opponent @entity93 ( @entity95 ) 104 2nd @entity96 ( @entity97 ) 79 3rd @entity98 ( @entity97 ) 28 4th @entity99 ( @entity100 ) 18 q / f @entity91 ( @entity97 ) 7 @entity101 ( @entity102 ) 2 f @entity79 ( @entity97 ) 1 @entity3 is scheduled to meet last year ’s runner - up @entity92 in the semi-finals this time			1
the @entity105 was practising at @entity5 yesterday after pulling out of his favoured @entity107 exhibition on thursday as a precaution to protect his wrist , which he notably flexed and shook at times yesterday			2
both @entity79 and @entity110 have potentially awkward second rounds			0
the @entity112 could meet @entity113 , the man who knocked him out at the same stage in 2012 , while @entity110 might meet @entity116 @entity115 , who led him by two sets that same year			0
enough @entity119 players have have had the luck of sympathetic draws to encourage thoughts of several home first - round wins , while in the women ’s draw the outstanding prospect is a quarter - final between the two favourites , @entity128 and @entity129			2
all white on the night : @entity3 models the new adidas collection he will be wearing at @entity5 tough times : @entity3 has had to deal with injury problems and changing coach since last summer three is the magic number ! @entity3 has been seeded third for his defence of the @entity5 title			1

@entity3 warned new coach @entity7 should n't be blamed if he crashes out of @entity5
@entity119 no 1 is defending his title after becoming first @entity119 winner for *77* years to win the @entity145
@entity147 handed favourable draw and will face @entity10 @entity9
@entity3 has revealed his new adidas *kit* that he *'ll* be wearing at @entity74
