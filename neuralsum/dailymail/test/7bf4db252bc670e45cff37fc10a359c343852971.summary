@entity0 has called for lessons to be learnt after historic sex abuse allegations @entity0 claims disgraced entertainer @entity3 ' tarnished ' his era after his fellow colleague 's names were ' dragged through the mud ' during probes into historic sex abuse			1
the 72 - year - old 's long - term employer , the @entity10 , is still reeling from a string of allegations levelled against former staff - most of them @entity15 's vintage			1
several media personalities were investigated and arrested following the launch of @entity19 , including broadcasters @entity20 and @entity22			1
the probe also exposed abuse by paedophile @entity25 , who sexually assaulted staff and patients aged between 5 and 75 over several decades			1
the @entity29 presenter professed his deep shock at the headlines , explaining that most of his colleagues in the industry were ' just working hard ' and ' having a good time '			1
' it 's upsetting , horrible , ' he said			1
' i never liked @entity37 , and i knew there was something about him that was odd but i did n't know what it was			1
' i saw him very rarely but the way he was , you could never have a sensible conversation with him			2
' but it was shocking when the stories came out			2
it 's tarnished that era , and it was n't really like that			1
most of us were just working hard , having a good time			2
' his good friend and fellow @entity25 , @entity59 , was also caught up in the scandal after spending a a year under a cloud of suspicion when he was arrested over historical sex offences			1
in his case the 65 - year - old was accused of having sex with two underage boys , however , the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) dropped the charges last year			1
@entity0 said he is outraged at how @entity59 was treated and has called for lessons to be learnt			1
he said : ' if somebody has done something wrong they should be punished but i do think there is something appalling going on when someone , anyone , can accuse you of something			2
' in @entity59 's case , he did n't know the people - and your name is just dragged through the mud			1
i saw him very recently and the fact is that there has been no apology , and he has lost a lot of money and it is not right			2
you have n't done anything wrong but it sticks			2
we need to learn something from this			2
' @entity15 has remained unequivocally untouched by scandal , and explained : ' that 's because i have n't done anything wrong , it 's as simple as that , ' he says emphatically			1
but the @entity25 , who started his career on pirate station @entity100 in 1964 , has faced his own controversies after proclaiming he had bedded more than 500 women in his @entity105 heyday			2
@entity0 said he never liked paedophile dj @entity3 ( pictured ) , who sexually assaulted staff and patients aged between 5 and 75 over several decades @entity22 and @entity20 were among @entity15 's former @entity10 colleagues caught up in the historic sex abuse scandal at the corporation he made the boasts in his 2007 autobiography @entity112 ! my life in @entity100 in which he said he had slept with 250 women – a number which he then doubled five years later in a magazine interview			1
the father - of - two , who was born in @entity121 and brought up in @entity122 by his nurse mother and gp father , now admitted : ' it was tacky , it was unnecessary and i wish i had n't done it			2
' it only happened , he maintains , as his autobiography 's ghost - writer said they needed a bit more sex , given the lack of drugs and ' rock n roll '			1
@entity15 says lessons need to be learned after his friend and colleague @entity59 ( pictured ) had charges against him dropped ' i was quite open about it - i do n't see anything wrong , and i never have , if two consenting adults make love that 's their business , providing it is all above board			1
' i was n't that bad , i just had a really good time - but i wish i had n't written about it quite so honestly as it hurt my mum and dad			0
it really was n't clever			0
' @entity0 married @entity156 actress @entity155 , mother of his advertising executive son @entity157 , when he was 30 but she left him after four years when she discovered he had had an affair			1
he remarried in 1992 , this time time to @entity159 , a theatrical agent 17 years his junior , and mother to his 18 - year - old daughter @entity162 , and the family live together in @entity164			0
this time he has remained faithful and admits that when he discovered his calls had been intercepted during the phone hacking scandal , he was n't fazed			0
' when all the phone hacking started i was called by the police who told me my phone had been hacked , ' he said			0
' and i thought " well , fine			0
that must have been boring			0
" it did n't bother me as there was nothing to hide			0
so i never pursued it			0
' three years ago he had to undergo laser eye surgery after he suffered a detached retina when he was mugged by three thugs who tried to steal his mobile phone as he left the @entity10			1
' it was like being descended on by a pack of wolves , ' he said			0
' they knocked me to the ground , but i managed to get at them with my umbrella and i did chase after them even though i had blood pouring down the side of my face			0
' i was on the phone to my wife at the time so she heard it all			0
' i did report it to the police , but what could they do ? it did shake me			0
my producer said " they must have really hated your music "			0
' he has also recently started wearing a hearing aid to correct the creeping hearing loss after spending the last 50 years wearing headphones blasting music into his ears			0
‘ you can barely see it , it fits snugly in your ear and there ’s just this little clear wire			0
and they do n’t whistle			0
wearing one just sharpens everything up a bit			0
they ’re fantastic little things			0
