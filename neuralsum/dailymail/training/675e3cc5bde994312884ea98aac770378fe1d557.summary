@entity0 has ruled out a return to @entity2 in any official capacity			1
the @entity5 legend admitted on tuesday that he regrets becoming a non-executive director under @entity8 ’s regime in november 2012 , before being elevated to chairman six months later			1
he resigned from that role in august 2013 – citing a ‘ highly dysfunctional environment ’ – and is adamant that his only future involvement at the club will be as a fan			1
former @entity2 manager @entity0 speaks to the press in @entity16 on tuesday three years ago , @entity0 was involved in a takeover bid that included @entity18 - whose consortium is still awaiting an answer on the £ 6.5million emergency funding package they have offered the current board			1
however , while insisting @entity18 would be well capable of restoring ‘ trust ’ between supporters and the hierarchy , the 66 - year - old would n’t be tempted by a comeback to a formal role under any regime			2
‘ no , i would n’t go back onto the board again , ’ said @entity0 , speaking at the launch of @entity32 , a @entity16 - based media relations and sports management company			1
‘ i found it was an environment i was n’t particularly comfortable in			2
i went on ( the board ) for what i felt were the right reasons			1
i thought at the time i could maybe help			2
as it turned out , i was wrong			2
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity2 captain @entity44 parade the club 's trophies at @entity5 in may 2011 ‘ i had resigned on two occasions and then eventually , being more or less the last man standing , i took the chairman ’s position for a wee while to see if i could help			1
‘ i quickly realised that was n’t going to be the case			2
there was nothing i could do to make any difference so i stepped away			0
i would n’t become involved as a director or anything like that again			0
’ asked if that reluctance would extend to a technical position , such as director of football , he added : ‘ @entity0 as a manager would never have had anything to do with a director of football			1
‘ if you are a football manager you run the club			1
‘ i ’m not going back			0
i ’ll go back as a supporter			0
i ’ve been along to a few of the games			0
that ’s really what i ’ll be doing now , taking my grandkids to a few of the games			0
i hope they can maybe support a @entity2 more like the one i used to support myself			1
’ @entity0 ( right ) sits alongside former @entity76 player @entity75 at the launch of @entity32 on tuesday @entity0 , who won 10 league titles over two spells as @entity2 boss , still reflects ruefully on accepting the directorship in the first place			1
‘ is it a regret ? yes , it is , ’ he said			0
‘ i did what i thought was best to try and help out			0
i think that if you were seen not to be trying to help after what happened with @entity88 then people would have said you know a bit about the club and should go back in			0
but it turned out that would n’t have mattered anyway			0
‘ i do n’t think anyone would have thought all this would have carried on over three or four years			0
it has been turmoil more or less throughout this time			0
