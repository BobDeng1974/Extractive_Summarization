@entity1 @entity0 has been cast in the role of bad guy at the @entity4 at the @entity5 , and how he is relishing it			1
up against @entity9 ’s latest @entity8 darling @entity10 on friday , he turned up for the part dressed appropriately in black trousers and black sweater			1
outside the ropes , his equally extrovert wife @entity14 chose an outfit laden with stars and stripes			0
at the eighth hole , the crowd got into the mood by ‘ shushing ’ @entity0 on to the green in a mischievous mocking of the player ’s infamous gesture at @entity27			1
he could n’t keep the smile off his face			0
@entity0 is thriving in the role as bad guy at the @entity4 at the @entity5 @entity0 ( right ) shakes hands with @entity10 ( left ) after winning his match on friday the 24 - year - old ( left ) congratulated @entity10 ( right ) on friday for claiming the winning @entity8 point ‘ i just wish i ’d been able to hole the putt and have a bit of fun back with them , ’ he said , smiling			1
if truth be told , of course , he ’s not the bad guy at all but a refreshing presence in a sport where characters are always welcome			0
the @entity48 crowds have developed a soft spot for him already and , as we learned three weeks ago in @entity51 , he can really play			0
@entity0 was firmly in control of this match until the end , when @entity10 threw an eagle at him at the 15th and then knocked a wonderful tee shot close to the flag at the par - three 16th			1
how would @entity0 respond ? he calmly knocked his own tee shot to eight feet and holed the putt to close out the match			1
‘ @entity62 , ’ is the logo on his sweater			0
by sunday night he might have to change it to @entity64			0
@entity0 made headlines earlier this year when he brashly forecast it would n’t be long before he was ranked among the world ’s top five			1
@entity0 enjoyed interacting with the crowd on friday as he did during the @entity8 ( pictured ) @entity10 fought back against the @entity1 with an eagle at the fifteenth but it was not enough talk about piling the pressure on yourself , yet the following week he hung on to win the @entity75 in @entity76			1
it was his third win on the @entity78 at the age of just 23 and now he has set his sights firmly on an overseas victory as the next step in his career			0
the first thing @entity0 did friday was congratulate @entity10 on claiming the winning point at the @entity8			1
‘ i saw him at @entity27 but only briefly amidst everything that was going on and so it was nice to get the chance to say well done properly , ’ said the @entity86			0
‘ we talked about it quite a bit , and let ’s hope we are both on future @entity8 teams			2
’ provided they win their quarter - final ties today , @entity0 will play @entity98 in the semis tomorrow morning in a repeat of their @entity8 singles match			1
asked about that , @entity0 came up with the perfect response			2
‘ he ’ll definitely be wanting to get back at me for that but i ’ll be feeling a bit that way as well , ’ he said			0
‘ after all , i might have got the @entity109 ( a win ) but he got to hold the trophy			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) takes on @entity113 ( left ) on saturday after the @entity114 beat @entity115 before that , @entity0 will take on @entity114 @entity113 on saturday while the impressive @entity98 , who closed out his match against @entity115 by holing his second shot to the par - four 17th , will play fellow @entity120 @entity119			1
it is perhaps as well @entity98 and @entity0 are still involved , for not one of the five players representing @entity48 and @entity124 made it out of the group stages			2
@entity128 @entity127 was the unluckiest			0
he was actually 10 under par for his 18 holes yesterday but still could n’t beat @entity119 , who matched him to force a play - off for a quarter - final spot			2
given the tremendous quality of the match , it was a shame that it had to end with a @entity127 blunder , as he found the water at the par five first to lose the hole to a par. defending champion @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 were the other casualties			0
the other quarter - finals on saturday , therefore , are all - @entity9 affairs : @entity146 against @entity147 while @entity148 will play @entity149 .			2

@entity0 beat @entity151 @entity10 on friday
the @entity1 interacted with the crowd as he did during the @entity8
@entity0 forecast he would be among the top five in the world soon
he faces @entity114 @entity113 on saturday
