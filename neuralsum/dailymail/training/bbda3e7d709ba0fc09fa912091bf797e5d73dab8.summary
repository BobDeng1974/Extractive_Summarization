' i immediately told my employers who said they were sorry but i ’d have to leave and they ’d keep the post open for me while i appealed against the results of the check			0
' that was back at the start of september and i ’ve been without work or a wage ever since while my appeal to the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) was dealt with			2
' i was left in limbo despite the criminal record obviously not belonging to me as so many of the details were different			1
i was angry as it could have so easily been sorted out , but i was told i ’d have to wait for at least three weeks before i could even chase up my appeal			0
' authorities asked @entity63 for any criminal convictions linked to mr @entity8 as part of the enhanced @entity19 , which is now known as the @entity19 checks			1
but the details of a different person from the @entity69 were sent			0

a force spokesman said : ' we acknowledge that in this case , due to a human error , mr @entity8 ’s details were incorrectly matched to another individual with similar details and this resulted in information that did not relate to mr @entity8 being disclosed on his @entity110			2
' we have spoken to mr @entity8 , and unreservedly apologised , and have advised him that his dispute has been returned to @entity19 and a revised , accurate certificate will be provided to him as quickly as possible			1
