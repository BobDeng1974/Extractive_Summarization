by @entity0 scientists may not have found extra-terrestrial life yet , but they now claim there are far more aliens out there than first believed			0
researchers in @entity7 believe that @entity9 - sized planets can support life at least ten times further away from stars than previously thought			1
this means that cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface			1
@entity7 academics claim cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface academics at the @entity21 and @entity22 claim the definition of the ‘ @entity30 ’ zone - the area of space around a star , or sun , which can support life – is flawed			1
they argue this definition fails to take into account life that can exist beneath a planet ’s surface			2
‘ as you get deeper below a planet ’s surface , the temperature increases , and once you get down to a temperature where liquid water can exist – life can exist there too , ’ said @entity21 phd student @entity36			1
in the study ' @entity46 ' , professor @entity44 proposes that tidal heating can create conditions where life could emerge on an icy or terrestrial planet once thought to be uninhabitable			2

to determine the location of a star 's habitable zone , scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits			0
knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry			0
for example , molecules in a planet 's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out			2
how much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes			0
researchers in @entity7 now claim that @entity9 - sized planets could support life at least 10 times further away from stars than first thought			2
in a galaxy of 200 billion stars of various types , scientists estimate there are 11 billion potentially habitable planets in the @entity56 as it is currently defined			0
factor smaller , dimmer red dwarf stars , and the number of planets with mild temperatures similar to @entity9 rises to 40 billion			0
researchers in @entity21 claim the figure is much higher			0
mr @entity36 told @entity104 the number was ‘ probably several times ’ larger but added that the is difficult to quantify			0
mr @entity36 's team created a computer model that estimates the temperature below the surface of a planet of a given size , at a given distance from its star			1
‘ the deepest known life on @entity9 is 5.3 km below the surface , but there may well be life even 10 km deep in places on @entity9 that have n't yet been drilled , ' he said			2
‘ using our computer model we discovered that the habitable zone for an @entity9 - like planet orbiting a sun - like star is about three times bigger if we include the top five kilometres below the planet surface			1
’ the model shows that liquid water could survive 5km below the @entity9 's surface even if the @entity9 was three times further away from the sun. ‘ if we go deeper , and consider the top 10 km below the @entity9 ’s surface , then the habitable zone for an @entity9 - like planet is 14 times wider , ’ said mr @entity36			1
the current habitable zone for our solar system extends out as far as @entity134 , but this re-drawn habitable zone would see the zone extend out further than @entity137 and @entity138			0
goldilocks zone is a belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for water to pool on a planet 's surface the findings also suggest that many of the so - called ‘ rogue ’ planets drifting around in complete darkness could be harbouring life			1
. ‘ @entity152 planets a few times larger than the @entity9 could support liquid water at about 5 km below the surface even in interstellar space , even if they have no atmosphere because the larger the planet , the more heat they generate internally , ’ said mr @entity36			1
‘ it has been suggested that the planet @entity163 , which is 20 light years away from @entity9 in the constellation @entity165 , may be too cold for liquid water at the surface			1
‘ however , our model suggests that it is very likely to be able to support liquid water less than 2 km below the surface , assuming it is @entity9 - like			1
’ so far , scientists have detected about a thousand planets orbiting other stars in something known as the @entity56			0
this is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet 's surface another paper published by the same team suggests there could be more life below the surface of the continents on @entity9 than there is below the seafloor			1
mr @entity36 hopes the studies will encourage other researchers to consider how life on other planets might be detected			0
‘ the surfaces of rocky planets and moons that we know of are nothing like @entity9 , ’ he said			2
‘ they ’re typically cold and barren with no atmosphere or a very thin or even corrosive atmosphere			0
‘ going below the surface protects you from a whole host of unpleasant conditions on the surface			0
so the subsurface habitable zone may turn out to be very important			0
‘ @entity9 might even be unusual in having life on the surface			2

planets thought uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface
computer model shows that liquid water could survive 5km below @entity9 's surface even if the planet was three times further away from the sun
suggests *astronomers* should look for life outside the ‘ @entity30 ’ zone
the @entity56 is the belt around a star in which temperatures are ideal for liquid water - and potentially life - to exist on a planet 's surface
