this is the gruesome moment a maggot wriggled out through the skin of an insect researcher – after he had kept it there on purpose			1
@entity7 of @entity8 in the @entity9 , was bitten by mosquitoes during a visit to @entity12 last summer – but found his bites were not healing when he returned			1
the @entity15 entomologist later realised that the bites contained bot fly larvae and decided to let them develop as part of an experiment			1
@entity7 realised bites he received while travelling in @entity12 contained the larvae of bot fly ( pictured ) the @entity15 entomologist later realised that the bites contained bot fly larvae and decided to let them develop as part of an experiment female bot flies capture mosquitoes and lay their eggs before letting them go as a way of getting larvae in to a living host			1
once the eggs are under the skin , they start to grow and the newly formed maggot uses its barbs to grip on			2
mr @entity7 had one of the larvae removed with a special suction device but launched an experiment to allow the two remaining maggots to grow			1
he then decided to make a video called the @entity44 showing the maggots emerging through his skin			1
it took two months for the creatures to grow to a size where they were capable of crawling out - but only takes 40 minutes for them to wriggle free			2
the gruesome - looking hole left by the maggot closes up and heals within about two days ' i figured that being a male it was my only chance to produce another living , breathing being out of my flesh and blood , ' he says on his video			0
' the process was not particularly painful			0
in fact , i probably would have not noticed it if i had not been waiting for it as the bot fly larvae produce painkillers that make their presence as unnoticeable to the host as possible			1
' ' perhaps my opinion would have been different had the bot flies decided to develop in my eyelids , but i actually grew to like my little guests , and watched their growth with the same mix of pleasure and apprehension as when i watch the development of any other interesting organism under my care			0
he goes on to explain that the hole left by the maggot closed up and healed within about two days			0
mr @entity7 then kept the maggot in a container and watched as six weeks later an adult fly emerged from its casing			2
@entity88 fly use mosquitoes as a means of getting larvae to a living host while intrepid travellers might accept getting the odd mosquito bite on holiday , most of them expect the red sores that emerge will quickly disappear			0
but when they start to develop into something resembling a boil , there is a slim chance bot fly larvae may have crawled under the skin			1
the bot fly , found in a number of locations around the world including in @entity109 and @entity110 , often use mosquitoes as a means of getting larvae to a living host			0
the female will capture the mosquito before laying its eggs and letting it go			0
once the mosquito has bitten the host , the larvae enters the skin - either through the bite wound or through hair follicles - before burrowing into the skin			2
after between five and 12 weeks it will be ready to leave its host by crawling out			0
@entity130 takes place in the ground and adults will generally emerge after two or three weeks .			0

@entity7 was bitten during *photography* visit to @entity12 last summer
@entity15 entomologist realised bites were not healing on return
after detecting *boy* fly larvae he decided to let two of them grow under skin
two months later he filmed the moment one of the maggots crawled free
