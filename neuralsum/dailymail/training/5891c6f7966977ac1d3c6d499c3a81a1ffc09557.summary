by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 12:58 est , 13 september 2013 an experiment that proved people who think they are drunk also think they are attractive and another that showed lost dung beetles can use the @entity6 to find their way home were among the winners at this year 's @entity10			1
the ceremony was the 23rd annual event for awards that celebrate the weirdest and funniest scientific discoveries in fields including psychology , biology and physics			1
the winners come from all over the world and @entity10 laureates handed out the prizes during a ceremony at @entity24 on thursday , sponsored by science magazine @entity25			1
researchers from @entity31 found that the higher a person 's blood alcohol level , the higher their attractiveness rating			1
they also found this was the case when people drank alcohol - free placebos editor @entity37 said the point is to make people laugh and then think			1
' the combination of science that is funny on its own - not because someone is making a joke , but it is funny - that 's an unusual notion in the @entity47 , ' he said			2
' it is becoming more acceptable again			2
' for the first time , the winners received cash prizes - $ 10 trillion , but in @entity52 dollars , which means they 'll receive around four @entity47 dollars each			2
the inventor of the trillion dollar note , @entity55 , won the @entity10 in 2008			1
every year , organisers try to make the awards ceremonies more ' silly ' than the last and this year 's ceremony included a mini-opera and a contest to win a date with a @entity10 laureate			1
the winners are due to give short speeches during another event this weekend at the @entity66			2
the psychology prize went to the experiment that found people who think they are drunk also think they are attractive			1
dung beetles travel in straight lines by taking cues from the sun , during the day , and the moon at night			2
yet the winners of the @entity10 biology and astronomy award found that the beetles also use light from stars on nights when the moon is n't visible this research was carried out by @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 of @entity87 and @entity88 , a professor at @entity89 who also teaches in the @entity90			1
to test their theory , people in a bar were to rate how ' funny , original and attractive ' they thought they were.the results found that the higher their blood alcohol level , the higher their attractiveness rating			1
researchers also noticed the same thing happened when people had been given an alcohol - free placebo but were told they had been drinking			1
a separate group of people were also asked to rate how attractive they thought each of the participants were , but the ratings varied wildly compared to how attractive the individuals thought they were			1
the dung beetle experiment won the joint prize in biology and astronomy , given to @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , who work in @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , the @entity117 and @entity118			1
psychology : an experiment that found people who think they are drunk also think they are attractive			1
winners : @entity123 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity124 and @entity88			2
joint prize in biology and astronomy : an experiment that showed lost dung beetles can use the @entity6 to find their way home			1
winners : @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			2
medicine : a study assessing the effect of listening to opera on heart transplant patients who are mice			1
winners : @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			2
safety engineering : an electro - mechanical system to trap an airplane hijacker by dropping him or her through a trap door , sealing him or her into a package and then dropping the packaged hijacker ( with a parachute ) to the ground where police will be waiting			2
winner : @entity160 physics : the discovery that some people would be physically capable of running across the surface of a pond - if both they and the pond were on the moon			1
winners : @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , and @entity173			2
chemistry : the discovery that the biochemical process by which onions make people cry is even more complicated than scientists previously realised			1
winners : @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			2
archaeology : two researchers who parboiled a dead shrew , then swallowed it without chewing so they could examine their excrement to see which bones would dissolve in the human digestive system and which would not			1
winners : @entity195 and @entity196			2
peace : @entity198 and its president , for making it illegal to applaud in public , and to the @entity198 state police , for arresting a one - armed man for applauding			2
probability : researchers who discovered that the longer a cow has been lying down , the more likely that cow will soon stand up , but that once a cow stands up , you can not easily predict how soon that cow will lie down again			1
winners : @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215			0
public health : for medical techniques described in their report , ' @entity217 in @entity218			0
' they recommend the techniques , except in cases where an amputated penis had been partially eaten by a duck			0
winners : @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , and @entity233			0
dung beetles travel in straight lines by taking cues from light released by the sun , during the day , and the moon at night			0
they do this to make sure they can push any dung piles to safety quickly , using the most direct course , to avoid going over old ground and running into predators or rival beetles			0
yet the insects ' ability to stay on course overnight when the moon was n't visible led the researchers to discover the beetles can also use the location and light from stars in the @entity6 as a guide			1
@entity146 , from @entity256 in @entity257 , won the medicine prize for his work into mice with heart transplants			1
he discovered that a mice with a heart transplant will survive longer if they listen to particular music			0
for example , a control group of mice survived an average of seven days after a transplant , although those that listened to @entity274 's opera @entity273 survived for an average of 27 days			0
@entity211 and his team from research centres in the @entity117 , the @entity90 and @entity276 discovered that the longer a cow has been lying down , the more likely that cow will soon stand up			0
yet once a cow stands up , you can not easily predict how soon that cow will lie down again			0
they won the probability award another animal study involved predicting the probability of when a cow is likely to stand up or sit down			1
@entity211 and his team from research centres in the @entity117 , the @entity90 and @entity276 discovered that that the longer a cow has been lying down , the more likely that cow will soon stand up			0
opera singer @entity290 as @entity273 in @entity273			0
researchers discovered that mice with heart transplants lived longer after listening to @entity274 's opera yet once a cow stands up , it is now easy to predict how soon that cow will lie down again			1
although @entity211 's study was branded ' silly ' by the judges , it also has a serious side because the research can be used to determine health problems in the animals			1
@entity306 's patent won the engineering prize for his ' anti-hijacking device ' which involved an electro - mechanical system that could trap an airplane hijacker by dropping him or her through a trap door			1
he or she would then be sealed into a package before being dropped from the plane , attached to a parachute , to the ground where police will be waiting			0
the patent read : ' a partition or barrier located immediately aft of the pilots cabin is adapted to be raised dividing the aft section longitudinally into port and starboard areas , the floors of which are dropped on command to lower the hijacker into a capsule in the belly of the plane			0
' the capsule is releasable through opened bomb bay doors having attached thereto a parachute for safely returning the hijacker within the capsule to earth			0
' other winners included @entity195 of the @entity47 and @entity196 of @entity276 , who parboiled a dead shrew , then swallowed it without chewing so they could examine their excrement to see which bones would dissolve in the human digestive system and which would n't			0

completely average , @entity345 , @entity47 , 1 week ago beer ... ... ... helping ugly couples reproduce for 10,000 years			0
@entity348 , @entity349 , @entity117 , 1 week ago this research is important and could be life saving			0
i met my wife whilst wearing beer goggles and must have kept them on till i married her			0
if only i had known about the destructive nature of wearing these goggles i could have been saved from a life of misery with the nagging cow			0
another piece of interesting science i have discovered ...			0
. the older they get the uglier they get			0
@entity365 , @entity366 , 1 week ago the one with the @entity198 banning public applause and arresting a one armed man for applauding in public was hilarious @entity371 , sydney , @entity115 , 1 week ago the dung beetle one and the physics one are awesome ! both are actually really contributions to science ( and no , i 'm not being sarcastic )			0
love this sort of thing : knowledge for its own sake rather than trying to make everything ' vocational ' and linked to the quest for the almighty dollar ( or pound )			0
@entity388 , @entity389 , @entity117 , 1 week ago would n't it have made more sense if the picture to illustrate the beer - goggles had shown an ugly couple looking at each other admiringly ? @entity396 , grants pass , @entity47 , 1 week ago i , for one , find that dung beetle information pretty cool			0
@entity399 , @entity400 , @entity47 , 1 week ago when a cow will stand up ? ? ? who has the time ? ? keep the 4 dollars or trillion zimbabwean @entity404 , @entity405 , @entity117 , 1 week ago the beer study won the psychology prize for proving people find themselves more attractive when drunk ! ! you could not make this crap up			1
@entity411 , @entity412 , @entity47 , 1 week ago what is the prize amount ? @entity415 , @entity416 , @entity87 , 1 week ago i 'd like scientist to research and then give a definitive answer to the colour of @entity422 , as i sometimes get into a lot of trouble when i pose the question of its colour to strangers			2
