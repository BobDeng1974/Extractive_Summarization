by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 6 november 2013 risk : a @entity3 study has linked ace inhibitors to sudden renal failure blood pressure drugs that are taken by millions of @entity8 could raise the risk of potentially deadly kidney problems , doctors fear			1
a study has linked @entity13 inhibitors and related pills to sudden renal failure , which is fatal in up to 30 per cent of cases			1
researchers at @entity3 are the first to assess the scale of the problem after concerns about the effects of the medication			1
at least five millions patients take the tablets , the most popular for high blood pressure , with the number rising each year			2
the academics compared hospital admissions for sudden kidney failure with prescribing rates for @entity13 ( short for angiotensin - converting enzyme ) inhibitors and related pills			1
these showed that between 2007 - 08 and 2010 - 11 , there was a 52 per cent rise in admissions and a 16 per cent increase in prescriptions for the drugs			1
the biggest increases in admissions tended be in patients from @entity43 surgeries which had the largest rise in prescriptions			0
the researchers said there was ‘ strong evidence ’ of a link but their project did not prove the drugs were to blame			1
they stressed that no patients should stop taking their tablets unless advised to do so by their doctor			0
however , safer prescribing of the drugs could cut kidney disease , and save money and lives , added the study			2
the academics calculated that 1,636 hospital admissions in the study period could have been avoided if prescriptions had stayed at 2007 - 08 levels			2
kidney doctor @entity65 , who co-wrote the report in the journal @entity68 , said some patients were anxious about the drugs			0
‘ i have looked after many with acute kidney injury who were taking these medications prior to becoming unwell and have often worried the drugs were doing more harm than good , ’ she said			0
lethal : renal failure is fata in up to 30 per cent of ases it is thought that the drugs make it more difficult for the kidneys to cope when a stomach bug causes diarrhoea or vomiting			1
a urine or chest infection may also cause problems			0
lead author dr @entity90 advised patients who get a bug to see their gp , who may give them blood tests and temporarily stop their tablets			0
‘ we are not saying these drugs are dangerous , that would be inappropriate , because there is clearly evidence they are very helpful to patients , ’ he said			2
dr @entity101 , a kidney specialist and adviser to charity @entity104 @entity8 , said ‘ overall the benefits outweigh the risks ’			0
she added that many trials had shown the drugs ‘ increase survival and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes ’			0
the @entity13 inhibitors and related pills are given to heart attack patients , diabetics and otherwise healthy people whose high blood pressure puts them at risk of cardiac attacks and strokes			1
the @entity123 said the drugs are highly effective and kidney problems are a recognised side - effect .			0

@entity13 inhibitor pills have been linked to sudden renal failure
the lethal *conditions* kills up to 30 per cent of those who suffer it
connection was *unveiled* by a @entity3 study
it found ' strong evidence ' that @entity13 inhibitors and renal failure are linked
