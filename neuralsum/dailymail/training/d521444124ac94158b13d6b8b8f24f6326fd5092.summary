by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:52 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 22 august 2013 @entity2 has been forced to remove a @entity4 app from sale in @entity6 in response to complaints about privacy abuses , as well as its potential to be used for extortion or stalking			1
@entity6 were outraged when they learned their country was a top target of the @entity16 's top secret overseas spying operation , but it seems that all bets are off when it comes to catching cheaters			1
tens of thousands managed to download the software before it was pulled off the market			0
boyfriend tracker : @entity2 has taken the controversial app off the market in @entity6 ' @entity6 are a jealous people , what can i say ? of course it 's going to be popular , ' said @entity31 , a 47 - year - old woman in @entity32 whose marriage ended seven years ago in large part because of what she said was her husband 's infidelity			1
' it 's a different type of spying , ' she said of comparisons to the @entity16 surveillance program			2
' you 're checking up on somebody you know intimately , not some stranger			0
' the app , called @entity48 - @entity47 for @entity4 - promises to act like a ' private detective in your partner 's pocket			1
' functions include sending the person doing the tracking updates on their partner 's location and forwarding duplicates of text message traffic from the targeted phone			1
spyware that works via @entity63 is marketed as a way to keep children safe or find lost phones , but a growing number of apps claim users can conduct @entity16 - level surveillance for less than a cup of coffee			1
there are now apps available that allow you to read a partner 's text messages , listen in on calls , and check calendars			1
some even remotely turn on a microphone so users can listen in to what their lover is doing at any time			0
for $ 8 per month , @entity84 promises to deliver all of the above functions and be undetectable			2
other apps , like @entity87 , ironically claim to work on a ' trust system '			2
the idea is that each member of a couple agrees to constant mutual monitoring of call histories , sms and @entity96 communication			0
cheating @entity98 bills itself as ' great for suspicious boyfriends or the stalker on the go			2
' then there are technologies like @entity105 that are , in theory , marketed to parents			0
but in practice , who knows whether the person installing the app is watching her son after school or her boyfriend after work ? almost all websites for products have disclaimers warning people not to use their products for illegal purposes			2
the definition of ' consent ' , it seems , is crucial			0
in 2011 @entity127 company @entity125 was forced to modify their @entity129 app after complaints that the app ran in the background without users knowing			2
in 2009 the @entity134 ruled that police attaching gps devices to cars was ' unreasonable search and seizure , ' and some states have laws against cyberstalking			0
but for private citizens , gps on phones remains a legal grey area			2
it 's the subject of a federal bill to close the loophole , but companies that create the apps insist that the technology is meant for legal monitoring			1
so the husband listed on your family plan or the boss who gave you the company smartphone may be within his rights to keep tabs on you			0
the app market saw record growth in 2013 , and there are now a number of anti-spyware options as well			0
there is even a command that allows a user to force the target phone to silently call their own , like a pocket dial , so they can listen in on what the person is saying			0
similar apps are marketed for smartphone users in other countries , including @entity177 and the @entity178 , but @entity4 is the first that has made any impact in @entity6 , a country still irate as it learns more about @entity182 's snooping			1
@entity6 has sent a government delegation to meet with @entity178 leaders about the spy program that was revealed by @entity186 , the former @entity16 contractor who has been on the run since may and was recently granted asylum in @entity191			1
@entity193 spokeswoman @entity192 said by email that as a policy the company does n't comment on why apps are removed			0
critics say even as advertised , apps like @entity4 can violate privacy rights , and they warn that in the wrong hands they could be used for more sinister purposes , like stalking			1
some in @entity6 argue it breaks an anti-online harassment and hacking law in place since april			1
the law is named after @entity6 actress @entity209 , who had nude photos of herself leaked by hackers in 2012 after she refused to pay about $ 5,000			1
however , similar apps popular on @entity193 play market themselves to parents as a means of monitoring how teenage children use the phone and where they are at any given moment			1
@entity218 , a 24 - year - old @entity219 - based developer behind @entity4 , says it has attracted around 50,000 users since its launch about two months ago			1
mr @entity218 insists his lawyer vetted the app and determined it does not violate any @entity6 laws			1
despite being removed by @entity193 , it is still available via direct download from his company 's website			0
a disclaimer on that website stipulates the app is for ' social and recreational use ' and absolves the developer of responsibility for any misuse			0
the first line of the download instructions says a woman installing the tracker on her boyfriend 's phone should do so ' with his consent '			0
' we are waiting for @entity193 's position on the removal of @entity4 from @entity2 , which we consider an error , ' read a posting on a @entity96 page @entity218 set up for the app. to install @entity4 , suspicious partners have to get their hands on their loved one 's smartphones and upload the app. a free version leaves the app 's icon visible on the target 's phone , while a version that costs $ 2 a month masks the icon			1
mr @entity218 said the app began as a joke between him and his girlfriend but the idea quickly caught on among their friends			0
' in @entity6 , we have this culture of switching partners really quickly , so this is a way of dealing with that , ' said @entity218			2
' people really appreciate having a tool to help them find out whether they 're being cheated on			0
' he acknowledged that ' of course some people are against it , but on balance the response from users has been positive			0
' he said he 's received messages of gratitude from around 50 people who used the app to ferret out their partners ' infidelity			2
while cheating in @entity6 cuts both ways , the app is clearly marketed to women suspicious of their male partners , right down to the name			1
postings on the app 's facebook page exhort : ' girls , share this			2
' still , mr @entity218 insisted he personally has never given his girlfriends any reason to worry			0
' i 've had three steady girlfriends until now but i 've never had these kinds of issues , ' he said .			0

the @entity6 app , called @entity48 - @entity47 for @entity4 - promises to act like a ' private detective in your partner 's pocket '
similar spyware ' stalker ' apps are already available in the @entity178 and @entity316
