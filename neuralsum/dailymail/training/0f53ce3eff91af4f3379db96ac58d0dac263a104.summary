@entity0 progressed to the last 16 of the @entity1 with an impressive 3 - 0 victory over @entity4 courtesy of an exquisite hat - trick from @entity6			1
the @entity8 playmaker fired home a brilliant curling opener to set @entity12 's side on their way before adding to his tally on the half - hour mark following a neat one - two with @entity17			1
@entity18 completed the hat - trick by slotting home @entity17 's square ball with twenty minutes to go			1
@entity0 will now face @entity23 's @entity22 in the next round			1
click here to read the match report click here for @entity29 's brilliant @entity1 @entity28 @entity4 : @entity30 @entity0 : @entity30 host commentator @entity0 are through to the last 16 ... and will face @entity23 's @entity22 ! following @entity33 's goalless draw with @entity34 , the @entity36 progress to the next round on six points with the @entity39 finishing third on four points			1
honduras finish the tournament without a single point to their name			0
that game will forever be remembered for @entity18 's three goals - what a player ! hat - trick hero @entity18 is replaced by former @entity49 midfielder @entity48			1
what a sublime performance from the @entity36 playmaker			0
i can see why @entity53 like @entity18			0
his reading of the game is brilliant and he can obviously finish , too			0
might have added a bit to his price tag , though			0
@entity0 's deadly duo of @entity17 and @entity18 celebrate @entity0 : @entity59 comes on for @entity60 @entity4 : @entity61 is replaced by @entity62 @entity17 - who looks a real handful and will join @entity64 this summer despite reported interest from @entity66 - is replaced by @entity67			1
@entity18 grabs his hat - trick and @entity0 are out of sight ! super play by the @entity36 - @entity17 totally exploited the space afforded to him on the left and charged forward before beating his man and laying the ball off to @entity18 who stroked the ball into the net			1
@entity78 picks up the first booking of the evening - obviously his younger brother @entity80 takes after him			2
@entity78 is bundled over in the box by @entity82 but referee @entity84 waves play on			0
a definite penalty and the @entity86 are right to feel aggrieved			0
exactly play by @entity87 as he covers for the keeper and nips the ball off the line after @entity91 had rounded @entity92 in the @entity36 net			0
@entity4 frontman @entity91 raced into the box and looked likely to get on the end of a teasing ball but bizarrely attempted to score with his head despite the fact the ball was barely off the ground ! had he stayed on his feet the @entity100 forward would have surely found the back of the net			1
... and @entity4 make their second change of the evening as @entity103 is replaced by @entity104			1
@entity0 lead @entity4 at the interval and it 's fair to say that first - half was very much the ' @entity108 '			1
here 's some brilliant snaps of @entity18 's opener ... so , @entity0 lead 2 - 0 and it 's fair to say the first - half has very much been the ' @entity113 '			1
here 's some brilliant snaps of the playmaker scoring his opener ... costly , @entity4 ' fourth all - time top goalscorer , has looked in some discomfort for a while now and has been forced off through injury			1
@entity78 , @entity80 's older brother , comes on in @entity121 's place to earn his 25th cap			2
@entity29 reported last week that @entity53 were interested in @entity18 after losing interest in @entity125 's @entity124			2
click the above link for the full story			0
and once again i 'm not convinced by @entity129 's defending there			2
looking good for @entity0 so far			1
this could be a hammering unless @entity4 find a way of holding possession			2
@entity18 doubles his own tally to extend @entity0 's lead			1
great movement by the playmaker as he latched on to @entity17 's through ball and found himself one - on - one with @entity140			2
the @entity8 man then kept a cool head to slot the ball into the corner of the net			0
really well - worked goal			2
@entity0 have been slightly under - rated during this summer 's tournament			1
as well the experience and know - how of @entity150 , the @entity36 have an abundance of talent among their ranks			2
@entity18 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity87 , @entity60 ... a host of stars used to playing for top clubs in @entity161 's main leagues			0
the ball falls to @entity163 in the area after @entity60 failed to properly head clear a free - kick but the @entity4 full - back can only volley wide on the turn			1
after six years in charge of @entity0 , @entity12 is set to retire following the @entity1			1
the @entity169 has won 19 club trophies during spells with @entity8 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
let 's hope the @entity36 progress so that @entity12 can go out on a high			1
the last time these sides met it was 0 - 0			1
typical of this @entity1 , this game has already given us more			0
what a stunning strike from @entity18			0
the @entity8 midfielder sends a curling effort into the top right hand corner to give the @entity36 the lead			0
must be said , however , @entity140 should have perhaps done better - did n't even dive ; just made a lackluster jump for it and watched it sail in			0
huge early chance for @entity0			2
@entity191 broke down the left after a weak challenge from @entity194 - what a poor @entity1 he 's had - and @entity17 shoots straight at @entity196			2
@entity197 , @entity103 and @entity194 - who all played for @entity198 , amongst others , in the @entity200 - will be looking to guide @entity4 to their first - ever @entity202 victory			1
meanwhile former @entity66 defender @entity82 starts at the back for @entity0 while @entity204 man @entity156 plays in midfield			2
the @entity36 , usually so sound at the back having conceded just six goals in qualification , conceded five against @entity34 in their last matc as they lost 5 - 2			0
however , having claimed a dramatic late win in their first @entity1 game against @entity33 , the @entity36 can go through with a draw providing the @entity39 lose to the @entity213			1
this will be the second ever meeting between these sides			0
the previous match played out involving these teams came in the @entity219 ; it ended 0 - 0 and it was also the last group game for both sides			1
honduras have never won against @entity223 opposition at a @entity1 ( @entity224 )			0
honduras have failed to score in their last 4 games against @entity223 team at @entity1			0
@entity0 have never lost against a @entity229 team at @entity1 ( @entity230 )			2

both sides still have a chance of progressing to the last 16			0
however , @entity4 , currently bottom of the group on zero points , need a win and hope @entity33 lose against @entity34 - goal difference will also come into play ...			1

@entity249 scores stunning hat - trick to give @entity0 a 3 - 0 win
@entity12 's side will qualified having bettered @entity33 's result
@entity4 finished bottom of the group with zero points
@entity0 will face @entity22 in the next round
