@entity1 chairman @entity0 took a surprising step in denying five @entity4 charges for text messages during which he labelled a supporter a ‘ retard ’			1
the unpopular chief initially had until march 30 to reply , but was granted an extension			2
his appeal is expected to be heard by a separate @entity4 panel next month and @entity0 still faces a ban from football activities			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 has decided to contest his @entity4 charge for allegedly abusive text messages @entity0 - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the @entity19 ’ worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four - hour @entity4 education course			1
the shocking text messages , seen by @entity24 , emerged just before @entity25 when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan @entity28 , who he told to ' enjoy the rest of your special needs day out '			1
@entity0 later apologised for his part in the exchange , and it is understood his denial boils down to a reasonable expectation of privacy			1
the development comes just days after pensioner @entity40 , a lifelong fan , was ordered to pay £ 20,000 in damages for alleged defamatory remarks made on his @entity44 page			2
the footballing world rallied around @entity40 , with a kickstarter fund amassing the thousands he needed to pay			2
on announcing @entity51 ’s denial , an @entity4 statement read : ‘ it is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of @entity4 rules , and that during the text message exchange , mr @entity0 used abusive and / or insulting words towards a supporter of @entity1			1
‘ it is further alleged that each of these five breaches of @entity61 ( 1 ) is an ‘ @entity62 ’ as defined in @entity61 ( 2 ) , as each included a reference to disability			2
‘ mr @entity0 has denied the charge			1
’ it is not the only example of foul - mouthed exchanges to have happened in a bitter campaign			0
the @entity71 are extremely unpopular at the club , and fans have been protesting against their ownership in a another rant from @entity51 , who also had abuse hurled at him , said : ' stop texting f * * * * * * , you should n't have ever started as you are one tiresome f * * * * * that should spot trains not watch football			0
get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium			0
' you are banned because i think you are a p * * * *			0
' impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f * * * * * * * as you			0
' @entity0 also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see @entity1 , a @entity94 side four years ago , spiral down to the @entity95 , with another text reading : ' i am a never - ending nightmare revenge mission '			1
their relegation to @entity98 was confirmed early last week and they are on course to tally the lowest number of points ever in the modern day second tier			0
there is to be a mass demonstration against their despised reign prior to the final game of the season against @entity110 next saturday			0
the content of the vile messages first emerged just before @entity25 and @entity0 came in for widespread condemnation			1
anti-discrimination group @entity115 registered their disgust , with local paper the @entity118 scrapping the chairman ’s weekly column with immediate effect			2
supporters have been protesting against the @entity71 before matches and then not attending the games @entity1 ’s off - field problems have become such a distraction that the club posted an article on their official site clarifying their stance on ongoing defamation cases , one involving a national newspaper			1
their lengthy statement on tuesday read : ‘ reluctantly , the company has been compelled to take action against a number of individuals and organisations following online postings or articles that contained vile lies and abuse about the club , its directors and players			0
to date , three settlements have been agreed with several further cases pending against other individuals and a national newspaper			0
‘ any payments from court or agreed settlements will be anonymously distributed to @entity153 and @entity154 based charities			0
the rationale of this policy is to avoid the adverse reaction towards such charities that accept the donations , as was the case when the club donated the first settlement to a leading , vibrant and forward thinking charity in @entity1 , @entity153 and @entity166			1
‘ the latest settlement of £ 20,000 will be paid over four years in equal installments , with the charities set to benefit as and when the money is received by the club			0
‘ for the avoidance of doubt , the club , directors , management staff and players would far prefer not to take any defamation action against any individual or organisation , but must continue to take action where necessary to combat the false , misleading stories and lies that are being perpetuated			0

@entity0 will face charges next month over shocking text messages
