now 26 - year - old @entity8 is celebrating what she describes as a ‘ miracle ’ after she gave birth to a beautiful , healthy , baby boy , weighing almost three kilos , on monday night			1
@entity14 , named after his father , was delivered by emergency caesarean section in @entity18 ’s @entity17 at 11.14pm after @entity8 went into early labour			1
the @entity2 campaigner said there are no words to describe the anticipation she felt as the doctors were ‘ tugging and pulling and getting him out ’			1

he is the most beautiful thing i ’ve ever seen			0
it is such a miracle and a gift , ’ she said			0
@entity8 , who lives in @entity18 with her husband @entity14 , was nine years old when her mother took her into the bush in @entity48 , @entity49 , and pinned her down while an old lady ' operated ' on her with a rusty knife			1
@entity8 was nine - years - old when her mother took her into the bush in @entity48 to have her circumcised ‘ she started hacking away			1

when @entity8 became pregnant she was honest about how her @entity2 experience was impacting on what should be a happy time			1
she had to deal with health professionals with ‘ a lack of knowledge and sensitivity ’ and just two months before her due date she still did not know if she would be able to have a vaginal birth due to her scarring			2
‘ i ’m scared it ’s going to be like @entity2 all over again , ’ she said in december			2
@entity92 vaginal scarring could have caused her baby ’s head to become stuck if she gave birth without a caesarean			1
so when her contractions began on monday night , @entity8 felt a sense of panic when she called the pregnancy hotline and was simply advised to tell her husband to get the towels ready			1
‘ i thought “ oh no i ’m not having this baby vaginally ” … they rushed me to the hospital but they said if the baby ’s head was too low already it might have to be a virginal birth			2

they still had time to get me into theatre and stop my nightmare coming true , ’ she said			0
‘ for a couple of hours i was in a lot of pain and there were a lot of @entity133 words			2
’ ‘ it all worked out in the end … for my baby to come into the world in the least traumatic way possible for both of us			0
there was drama but i would n’t have had it any other way , ’ she added			0
@entity38 is cherishing her first few days as a new mother			2
‘ i do n’t want to let him out of my sight			0
i did n’t let my husband hold him , i said “ he ’s mine , he ’s mine ” , ’ she laughed			0
‘ i keep thinking “ wow i made that , that came from me , it ’s overwhelming			0
he ’s absolutely gorgeous ”			0
’ and she can already spot signs of baby @entity14 ’s personality			2
‘ his eyes are wide open , he ’s very peaceful , he eats a lot and is a little mini @entity8 , he ’s very feisty and already a strong , strong man , ’ she gushed			2
