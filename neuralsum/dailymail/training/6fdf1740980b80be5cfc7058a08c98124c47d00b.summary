by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political editor published : 19:33 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 19:33 est , 15 june 2013 smiling : but @entity3 and @entity4 are still at odds with claims that friends of @entity3 have been ' banned ' from @entity4 's farewell party the feud between the @entity4 brothers was reignited last night over claims that friends of @entity12 leader @entity3 have been ‘ banned ’ from a farewell bash as @entity4 starts a new life in @entity15			1
invitations to a champagne party in @entity19 ’s @entity18 have been sent to all @entity20 who voted for @entity4 when he was narrowly beaten by @entity3 in the party leadership contest in 2010			1
but mps who backed the younger sibling claim they have been left off the list			2
the snub illustrates the continuing hostility between the rival factions of @entity4 and his @entity29 brother			2
one ally of @entity3 said : ‘ it is a typical act of pettiness by @entity4			1
it shows exactly why he lost the @entity12 leadership to @entity3 – he has no idea how to treat his colleagues with respect			1
’ a @entity12 mp who voted for @entity3 added : ‘ judging by those who have got invites and those who have n’t , they have gone down a list of those who voted for @entity4 and invited them and scrubbed the rest of us off			1
to exclude people because they did not vote for you three years ago is stupid			0
‘ it is time to bury the hatchet , but @entity4 can never bring himself to do it			0
’ embarrassingly for @entity3 , most @entity20 have been invited , since the majority supported his brother in 2010			2
@entity3 ’s victory depended on his overwhelming support from union barons			0
few union officials have been invited to the bash			0
the party is being organised by three leading @entity61 figures : former home secretary @entity62 , who backed @entity4 ’s leadership campaign , @entity12 frontbencher and former television presenter @entity66 and ex-labour general secretary @entity67			1
the event is being held in an upmarket bar in @entity19 ’s @entity71 on july 9			0
it will feature speeches highlighting @entity4 ’s record as @entity76 ’s head of policy and later , foreign secretary			0
one of the party organisers said they did not know if @entity81 had been invited			0
the @entity83 ’s office said he had been – and would attend			0
relations between the two brothers have not recovered from the acrimonious race to succeed @entity87			2
@entity4 ’s wife , musician @entity88 , is said to have remained ‘ frosty ’ towards @entity3 ’s wife , @entity89 , ever since			1
the row is said to have caused so much friction that they have not attended each other ’s children ’s birthday parties			0
in the wake of his failed bid , @entity4 ’s allies urged him to stay on in politics and plot his revenge in the hope that @entity3 would make a mess of the job and be forced to step down			1
acrimonious : @entity4 's wife @entity88 , left , is said to have remained ' frosty ' towards @entity3 's wife @entity89 , right but , despite low personal ratings , there is little appetite among @entity12 mps to change the party leader			1
and @entity4 , whose image never recovered from posing with a banana in one hand , became a peripheral figure in @entity114			0
earlier this year , he abandoned all hope of replacing his brother and decided to quit the @entity117 and move to @entity15 as head of the @entity120 - based @entity119			1
his £ 300,000 - a - year salary is nearly five times higher than his wage as a @entity12 mp			1
he will also get a plush office near @entity120 ’s @entity125 , complimentary private health care , a tax - free pension and a host of other perks			0
@entity4 will be responsible for humanitarian projects with 12,000 staff and an annual budget of £ 240 million			2
the @entity119 ’s money comes mainly from public grants – including £ 110 million of @entity136 aid over the past ten years .			0

invitations sent to all @entity12 mps who backed @entity4 in 2010 contest
mps who voted for @entity3 in leadership race claim they have been snubbed
@entity4 has quit *commons* for £ 300,000 a year role in @entity15
relations between the brothers ' wives also said to be ' frosty '
