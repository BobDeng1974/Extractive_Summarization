mother - of - three @entity7 , 43 , became engulfed in flames after a she leaned over a mosquito - repelling tealight , which ignited a tassel on the £ 45 beach dress she had bought especially for her break			1
she tried to pat down the flames but when her dress kept burning she was forced to throw herself into a cold shower to put them out			2
close shave : @entity7 , 43 , holds her dress which was set on fire by a candle as she holidayed in @entity18			1
she believes she was saved by her @entity6 bikini underneath terrifying : @entity7 became engulfed in flames after a tea - light set ignited a tassel on the £ 45 tunic she had bought especially for her break and left her with these terrible scars the @entity28 adviser suffered third - degree burns across 40 per cent of her body with painful sores developing on her armpits , back , arms and hands			1
but she was saved from even worse injuries and possibly death because her @entity6 bikini protected her chest , private parts and face			1
she spent four weeks in hospital and will be scarred for life but doctors told her she could have died if she had n't been wearing the swimwear			1
the bikini top acted as a barrier - stopping the flames reaching her head			2
@entity7 , of @entity48 , @entity49 , said : ' it was terrifying , i screamed for my husband as i frantically tried to put out the flames			2
' but less than two seconds later i was engulfed			0
it was just so quick			0
' i was expecting it to smoulder a bit , like a tea towel does if you accidentally set fire to it , but it just went whoosh			0
race for life : she quickly tried to pat down the flames but when her dress kept burning she was forced to throw herself into a cold shower to put them out painful : she suffered third - degree burns across 40 per cent of her body with painful sores developing on her armpits , back , arms and hands ' i dropped to the floor and tried to roll around to put it out but it was no good , i could feel the flames burning my skin and the pain was excruciating			1
' it all happened so quickly , i just remember that i ran through the living room , on fire in front of my son , and got into the shower			0
' there were just remnants left of my white cotton tunic dress , but incredibly my @entity6 bikini was still intact , although a little smoke damaged and a bit singed in places			1
' if it was n't for the bikini protecting me i could have died			0
if i 'd have got many more burns it probably could have killed me			0
remnants : as she was cooking she leaned over a tealight - setting fire to her cotton @entity100 ( @entity101 ) - luckily her £ 35 bikini ( r ) saved some areas from injury scarred for life : despite calling an ambulance straight away @entity7 was forced to wait three hours for it to arrive - and then medics failed to recognise the severity of her burns ' i 'm quite thankful i had that on underneath really because it stopped it spreading up to my chest and then my face , i dread to think how much worse it could have been			1
' the incident happened one night into a week - long break with husband @entity117 , 44 , and son @entity118 , seven , in @entity119 , @entity18 , last august			2
@entity7 , who has two children from a previous marriage , had bought mosquito - repelling tealights as @entity118 was suffering a number of bites			2
but as she was cooking she leaned over one , setting fire to her floaty , cotton @entity128 beach dress			0
despite calling an ambulance straight away @entity7 was forced to wait three hours for it to arrive			2
and when the medics eventually arrived , they did not recognise the severity of her burns			0
hospitalised : @entity7 in hospital in @entity18 , with her son @entity118 , after her dress was set alight by a candle family : the mother - of - three became engulfed in flames after a tea - light set her dress alight she was taken to hospital in @entity145 where doctors who spoke little @entity147 left her in agony overnight , with a just a cold towel on her back and arms			1
within days her injuries were blistering , and her right arm even turned yellow and green due to the severity of the burns , but still doctors refused to do anything but apply water and cream			0
@entity7 spent three weeks in these appalling conditions , including her birthday , before @entity161 doctors arranged to have her flown back to a specialist burns unit at @entity163 in @entity164			2
by the time she arrived , however , it was too late for doctors to attempt a skin graft and she was discharged a week later			0
@entity7 is now forced to wear uncomfortable pressure garments 23 hours a day , and will have to keep them on for at least the next 18 months while her scars heal naturally			1
before the incident : @entity7 , pictured here with her husband the day before the fire , spent three weeks in a @entity18 hospital in appalling conditions before @entity161 doctors arranged to have her flown back home too late : she was flown back to a hospital in @entity164 but by the time she arrived it was too late for doctors to attempt a skin graft and she was discharged a week later she is still in extreme pain and has hypertrophic ( raised ) scarring on her back , flank and under her arms			1
@entity7 added : ' if i 'd been wearing something less flammable , i would n't be in the situation i am today ' i honestly ca n't believe my £ 35 bikini saved my life , it is unbelievable that it did n't go up in flames			1
' the last year has been very testing for me , you never expect something like that to happen to you and i think it 's everyone 's worst nightmare			0
' i 'm still in agony one year on , and will be horrendously scarred for life			0
