a mother who was sent death threats by so - called internet ‘ trolls ’ has won a landmark legal case against @entity5			1
@entity6 was tormented for months by anonymous internet bullies after she left an innocent message of support for an @entity11 contestant on the social networking site			1
she went to police to make a complaint but claimed officers told her to go home			0
months of torment : @entity6 was targeted by internet trolls after she messaged her support for @entity11 star @entity20 now she has won a legal order forcing @entity5 to disclose the identities of the trolls			1
it is the first time an individual has won such an order and @entity27 , 45 , hopes to pursue private prosecutions against those responsible for her months of ‘ vicious and depraved ’ abuse			2
charities said the @entity34 ruling sent a message to the cyber bullies that their anonymity can be stripped away , leaving them open to prosecution			0
campaigners warned that online bullying has become the ‘ weapon of choice ’ among children and teenagers , with police and prosecutors failing to keep pace with the changes in technology			0
miss @entity6 ’s ordeal began last november when her daughter told her that an @entity11 contestant , @entity20 , had received hate mail on @entity5			1
stung by the cruelty , the mother left a message on his @entity5 page , saying simply : ‘ keep your chin up , @entity20 , they ’ll move on to someone else soon			1
’ how it started : @entity6 's support for @entity11 's @entity20 led to a horrid hate - campaign against her within minutes bullies on the site turned on her , writing vile abuse including ‘ your [ sic ] a desperate pedo b * * * * ’ and ‘ @entity72 [ sic ] a * * * * ing dog ’			1
more than 100 cruel messages were left in just 24 hours			0
miss @entity6 said : ‘ @entity5 users began deliberately targeting me , writing under my comment that i was a paedophile and hoping that i would die			1
’ worse followed when an online bully set up a fake @entity5 profile in @entity27 ’ name , with her photo and personal email address , and used it to send explicit messages to thousands of children , some as young as nine			1
some messages falsely described her as a drug dealer , a prostitute and a paedophile and known child abuser , and others attempted to ‘ befriend ’ young girls			1
on @entity95 this year , trolls published the single mother ’s home address in @entity98			1
horrified , she reported the abuse to @entity5 and the police , but said officers did nothing to help her			1
she said one officer told her she could leave a dossier of evidence ‘ but we wo n’t read it ’			0
frustrated by their response @entity27 contacted lawyers and began legal action to force @entity5 to reveal details about her anonymous tormentors			2
last week the @entity34 granted an order compelling the site to disclose the bullies ’ names , email addresses and their computers ’ internet protocol ( ip ) addresses , which can be used to determine a computer ’s location			0
miss @entity6 said : ‘ these abusers are not just random people who have nothing better to do with their time			2
‘ these are organised people who have been operating on @entity5 for years			0
‘ i ’m going for the strongest possible prosecution against these people			0
’ last month , a survey found that just over half of all internet users have received abuse online or by text message			2
only a minority report the abuse to police as many believe it will not be taken seriously			0
jibes : @entity6 has her picture posted on @entity5 - and someone suggests she has been sending round pictures of child abuse offensive : some more of the abuse that went on @entity5			1
this page formed part of the evidence that @entity6 's solicitors presented to the @entity34 prosecutions under the @entity150 , which makes it illegal to send grossly offensive messages , have increased three-fold since 2004			1
there were almost 900 such prosecutions last year but prosecutors accept that only a minority of trolls are brought to justice			0
miss @entity6 has remained on @entity5 despite the abuse and said she was determined not to be bullied into quitting the site			1
her legal action would have cost her up to £ 5,000 but her solicitors @entity163 agreed to take the case for free because of her horrific treatment			0
lawyer @entity166 said @entity5 had not contested the action and had agreed to hand over the information within six weeks			2
four individuals were believed to have led the abuse against @entity27 and her lawyers will consider private prosecutions against them			0
if their @entity5 accounts were set up using fake names and email addresses , lawyers will have to return to court and win similar orders against the trolls ’ internet service providers , to get the bill - payers ’ addresses			1
rise of the sick internet trolls @entity184 : ms @entity6 shows off print outs of some of the abuse she suffered online at the hands of tormenters abuse : a false @entity5 page that was set - up for @entity6 by the cyber bullies mr @entity166 said : ‘ it should have been the police ’s job to get these details from @entity5 but they have completely failed in their responsibility to do that			1
’ @entity5 said it reveals its users ’ names and email addresses only if a court orders it to do so			2
a spokesman said : ‘ there is no place for harassment on @entity5 , but unfortunately a small minority of malicious individuals exist online , just as they do offline			0
we respect our legal obligations and work with law enforcement to ensure such people are brought to justice			0
’ @entity214 , of @entity215 , said : ‘ bullies hide behind the anonymity of the internet and they should not be able to do so			0
you ca n’t be anonymous if you say something hurtful in the office or the schoolyard and people need to learn you ca n’t be anonymous on the internet either			0
’ @entity225 said they had asked @entity5 to remove any abusive posts about @entity227 and insisted they were investigating the case			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we need to gather evidence to prove who the person is for a successful prosecution to take place			0
’ insults : here someone posted @entity6 's home address in @entity98 where she lives alone ( left ) while ' @entity240 ' posts more offensive messages			2

@entity6 , 45 , was targeted by internet trolls after posting message of support for @entity245 contestant @entity20
the mother , who does *n't* even watch @entity245 , wrote message supporting singer on his official @entity5 page after her daughter showed her his page
abusers created fake profile with her picture and posted sick messages to lure young girls
the single mother is the first person ever to bring a court case privately to track down those who abused her
she was forced to take action after police *refused* to *intervene*
despite the abuse , @entity6 is still on @entity5
