' the @entity8 qualifier , from @entity42 , went on to tell his twitter followers that he was in ' agony '			1
but he did not allow the injury to stop his remarkable run at the @entity11			0
the crowd favourite nipped a potential @entity12 fightback in the bud by retrieving an immediate break at the start of the third , winning four games in a row			1
sympathy : @entity35 tweeted that he have never seen play interrupted while a player had a physio tend to their sore nipples no pain , no gain : @entity1 tweets that his nipple rash that caused his @entity11 game to be temporarily halted while he received treatment was ' agony ' amused : @entity35 saw the funny side of fellow @entity8 @entity1 ' injury and tweeted ' nice nipples ' after seeing the unusual drama unfold on the court after dumping out 11th seed @entity72 in round one , @entity1 followed up with a 1 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7/4 ) 6 - 3 win over his fellow tennis wild child that in some ways was even more impressive			1
the victory gets @entity1 , ranked number three in the country , around Â£ 60,000 - almost half his career earnings so far - and , perhaps even more importantly , 90 ranking points			2
it has been some week for @entity1 , who on wednesday was invited to practise with @entity84 - a potential fourth - round opponent			2
@entity85 , set and match : after being patched up by his physio , @entity8 qualifier @entity1 , right , went on to beat @entity12 , left @entity84 is coached by @entity88 , who used to work for the @entity89 , and the @entity90 said : ' it was the first time i really got to meet him or play with him			1
' now i have an idea how he plays , which i guess is not a bad thing			0
i think we were really just trying to help each other out on a rainy day trying to get a hit in			0
i thought he played really nice , he 's got a great shot			0
' i 'm still a little bit surprised he beat @entity12 , because we know what @entity12 can do			2
but great effort for him			0
sore point : @entity8 tennis player @entity1 , pictured warming up before the match , suffered agonising nipple rash during his @entity11 game at @entity108 , @entity109 ' to be in a third round of a slam is a huge opportunity			1
it does n't get easier from here , but it should give him a ton of confidence			0
and it 's great for @entity8 , no doubt about it			2
' the world number 179 had been nerveless in round one but could not get into the match at all in the first set , spraying his forehand and serving three double faults			2
the second set was where the match turned , although it did not look that way when he was broken for a third time in the match to trail 2 - 1			0
but he broke back immediately and made it three games in a row with a second break , set up by a characteristically excellent volley			0
neither player was serving well , but @entity1 did not panic when @entity12 battled back to 4 - 3 and forged ahead again			1
all smiles : @entity1 overcame his nipple rash to beat @entity13 @entity12 to progress to the third round of the @entity11 he betrayed a few nerves when he doubled - faulted on his first set point , and two more came and went , but @entity1 took his fourth chance when @entity12 put a backhand wide			1
the 23 - year - old from @entity42 is not short of confidence having won 12 of his previous 14 matches , reaching back - to - back @entity153 finals			0
the pair exchanged breaks at the start of the third and , although it went with serve from then until the tie - break , it was @entity1 who was pushing the pace			0
his forehand had been a little wayward but it was a shot @entity12 struggled to deal with when @entity1 got it right , and it would become the key weapon of the match			1
@entity1 is a confident character and seems largely immune to the tightness that usually invades a player 's arm at big moments			0
he played a superb tie - break , bossing world number 52 @entity12 and forging into a 6 - 3 lead			0
the @entity13 saved one set point but @entity1 powered away another forehand winner - he hit 20 during the match - to clinch the second			1
@entity12 has been accused of throwing in the towel in previous matches , including against @entity179 here last year , and he began to look dejected as the match slipped away			2
@entity1 simply gave him no way back in , serving two aces in a row to bring up three match points			2
he double - faulted on the first but his serve did the job on the second to earn him a third - round date with either 19th seed @entity187 or @entity189 of @entity190 .			0
