the 81 - year - old media tycoon , who is an avowed supporter of @entity8 took to @entity9 to call the coverage of events in the @entity12 by @entity13 and the @entity14 biased to the point of ' embarrassment			1
' stirring up controversy , @entity17 also questioned , ' why is @entity19 - owned press so consistently anti-israel in every crisis ? ' and asked if president @entity23 's ' friends in @entity24 ' could stop the shelling of @entity8			2
reaction to the tweets was swift with @entity29 political reporter @entity28 saying he wanted whatever ' @entity0 is smoking ' and @entity31 political reporter @entity30 tweeted simply ' wow '			0
@entity1 chairman @entity0 has taken to his @entity9 feed to question the ' bias ' he feels that certain @entity36 media organisations are displaying towards the fresh conflict in @entity6 and @entity8 in one tweet , the @entity1 chief pointed an accusatory finger at @entity13 and the @entity14 in another tweet which caused some political commentators to scratch their heads - @entity0 asked why the @entity19 - owned press does not back @entity8 @entity0 's controversial tweets came as the @entity46 on saturday said that @entity8 had the right to defend itself against attack and decide how to respond to rocket fire from the @entity6			1
the @entity46 is blaming the ruling @entity53 militant @entity51 group for starting the conflict			0

@entity8 on saturday hit @entity6 with nearly 200 airstrikes , expanding an aerial assault to include the prime minister 's headquarters , a police compound and a vast network of smuggling tunnels			1
@entity23 and @entity8 prime minister @entity75 are in agreement that a de-escalation of the violence is preferred , provided that @entity51 stops sending rocket into @entity8 , @entity55 said			0
the @entity8 government has called up thousands of reservists and massed troops , tanks and other armored vehicles along the border with @entity6 , signalling a ground invasion could be imminent			1
