by @entity0 published : 07:26 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 11:30 est , 15 november 2012 millionaire businessman @entity1 has had a ruling banning him from using a rotating helipad in his garden overturned a millionaire water ski champion is to be allowed to use a rotating helicopter landing pad in his garden after overturning a council ban			1
businessman @entity1 was furious when @entity8 ruled that he could not use the pad in the grounds of his mansion to protect a nearby willow tree and prevent noise and pollution irritating his neighbours			1
mr @entity1 , who became @entity17 's first private airborne fire ranger last year after volunteering with @entity18 , said that the ban had left him unable to do anything with the pad other than play table tennis on it , dine on it and use it for ' recreational sumo wrestling '			1
taxpayers will now have to foot the bill for @entity30 's legal costs and mr @entity1 's own Â£ 30,000 expenses after the ruling was overturned on appeal			1
the pilot built the revolving pad , which is covered with turf , in the grounds of his luxury home situated on the bank of the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 , so that he could take off into the wind , but did so without planning permission and had to apply to the council retrospectively			1
he was granted permission by the authority 's planning committee but it said that he could not use the turntable for his chopper in case a protected willow tree was damaged			1
mr @entity1 said : ' it seems bonkers that i can land anywhere i like in my garden , but the council wants to say i can not land on a flush mounted turntable that allows the helicopter to be swung around			1
' the council says that landing on the turntable might damage the a tree , but i could land on that spot if the turntable was not there			0
' would i really want to land too close to a tree in a helicopter ? ' it all seems daft and childish nonsense to me and yet another appeal to waste public funds			2
' in his decision report planning inspector @entity70 described the ban as ' unnecessary ' , ' perverse ' and ' unreasonable '			0
mr @entity70 pointed out the mr @entity1 has permission from the @entity74 to take off or land at his property up to 14 times a week			2
mr @entity1 , said that this is the third planning appeal he has lodged against @entity30 @entity1 , pictured with his helicopter , has permission from the @entity74 to take off or land at his home 14 times a week mr @entity1 insisted his immediate neighbours do not have a problem with the helicopter			1
he said he does not fly it early in the morning or late at night and only uses around half of the permitted take - offs and landings			0
the millionaire , who owns the @entity89 of luxury homes in the @entity91 and often commutes to work in his executive @entity94 500e helicopter , said : ' it 's a great shame , this is the third appeal in two years they have put me through for applications that really are so benign			2
' the first was for solar panels , and we again won costs , and the second was for some gates			0
the thing i find most galling is it 's such a waste of public money and i do n't get all the money			0
' planning committee chairman @entity109 said : ' there have been particular problems on this site with retrospective applications , the planning application only coming in after development has been completed			0
' i would urge mr @entity1 to do as other land - owners do and discuss what he wants to do with planning officers before submitting an application , and then doing the work if and when that application was approved			0
that would generate real savings both for himself and for the council			0
' the rotating helipad is in the grounds of mr @entity1 's @entity41 home , situated on the banks of the @entity40 in @entity42 , which he calls @entity131			2

@entity1 built the rotating landing pad in his garden so that his helicopter can take off in to the wind before applying for planning permission
@entity30 banned him from using his chopper to protect a nearby willow tree and to prevent noise and pollution
taxpayers will now foot the legal costs for the businessman 's *successful* appeal
