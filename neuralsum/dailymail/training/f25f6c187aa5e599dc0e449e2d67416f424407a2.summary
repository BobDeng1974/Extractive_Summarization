the @entity1 military launched its highly secretive unmanned $ 1 billion @entity3 space plane into orbit today from @entity5 on top of an @entity8 rocket			1
the @entity9 which operates the small , top - secret version of the space shuttle still will not say how long the third @entity3 mission will last , nor what the vehicle will be doing in orbit			1
cloud coverage in the area had threatened to scupper today 's launch , but the skies cleared sufficiently for the classified mission to take - off on time at 1.03 p.m from the @entity23 space center			1
scroll down for @entity24 a @entity26 rocket , carrying an @entity3 experimental robotic space plane , lifts off from launch complex 41 at the @entity5 in 2012 it is the second flight for this original @entity3 spaceplane			1
the craft circled the planet for seven months in 2010			2
a second @entity3 spacecraft spent more than a year in orbit			2
the high - tech mystery machines – 29 feet long – are about one - quarter the size of @entity38 's old space shuttles and can land automatically on a runway			2
the two previous touchdowns occurred in @entity41 ; this one might end on @entity38 's three - mile - long runway once reserved for the space agency 's shuttles			2
the military is n't saying much if anything about this new secret mission known as @entity48 , or @entity49 , flight no. 3			2
in fact , launch commentary ended 17 minutes into the flight and a news blackout followed			0
lift - off : @entity9 officials said the unmanned space plane , which resembles a miniature space shuttle , provides a way to test technologies in space but one scientific observer , @entity62 of the @entity63 , speculates the spaceplane is carrying sensors designed for spying and likely is serving as a testbed for future satellites			1
he dismisses rumors of ' exotic ideas ' for the @entity3 as weaponry or shadowing a @entity72 satellite			2
while acknowledging he does not know what the spaceplane is carrying , @entity62 said on - board sensors could be capable of imaging or intercepting transmissions of electronic emissions from terrorist training sites in @entity79 or other hot spots			0
' all the sorts of things that spy satellites generally do , ' he said			0
the beauty of a reusable spaceplane is that it can be launched on short notice based on need , @entity62 said			0
what 's important about this flight is that it is the first reflight			0
' that is pretty cool , ' @entity62 said , ' reusing your spacecraft after a runway landing			0
that 's something that has only really been done with the shuttle			0
' @entity97 : the @entity8 rocket carrying the @entity1 military 's @entity3 spacecraft lifts off from launch complex 41 in @entity5 , @entity23 today this april 5 , 2010 photo made available by the @entity9 shows the @entity103 at the @entity105 facility in @entity106 @entity23 - this was the vehicle 's second launch now retired museum pieces , @entity38 's space shuttles stretch 122 feet long , and have 78 - foot wingspans and weights of more than 170,000 pounds			1
they were launched , from 1981 to 2011 , with two strap - on booster rockets and an external fuel tank feeding three main engines			0
the @entity3 wingspan is 15 feet , and the 11,000 - pound , @entity120 - built vessel requires the @entity26 's hefty @entity8 for hoisting			1
the two previous secret @entity3 flights were in 200 - plus - mile - high orbits , circling at roughly 40 - degree angles to the equator , as calculated by amateur satellite trackers			2
that means the craft flew over the swatch between 40 degrees or so north latitude and 40 degrees or so south latitude			0
that puts @entity133 's far north out of the spaceplane 's observing realm , @entity62 noted			0
' it might be studying @entity138 latitudes or it might just be being used for sensor tests over the @entity1 , ' he said			0
@entity62 speculates that this newest flight will follow suit			0
lift off : the @entity3 sits on top of an @entity8 rocket as it 's launched at @entity5 in @entity23 in 2010 the military is not saying how long the third @entity3 mission will last , nor what the vehicle will be doing in orbit			1
' the focus of the program remains on testing vehicle capabilities and proving the utility and cost - effectiveness of a reusable spacecraft , ' @entity9 spokeswoman @entity149 wrote in an email to @entity157			2
while launching from @entity23 , the military has been landing the robotic space planes at @entity159 in @entity41			1
the agency is considering landing and refurbishing its @entity3 spaceships at @entity38 and @entity9 bases in @entity23 , which has been courting new customers since the retirement of @entity38 's space shuttles last year			1
personnel are shown here inspecting the @entity3 , the @entity9 's first unmanned re-entry spacecraft , after landing on december 3 , 2010 at @entity159 in @entity41 ' we are investigating the possibility of using the former shuttle infrastructure for @entity172 landing operations and are looking into consolidating landing , refurbishment and launch operations at @entity175 or @entity5 in an effort to save money , ' @entity149 wrote			1
' those investigations are in an early state , and any specifics will not be known for some time , ' she added			0
the vehicles , which were built by @entity120 , are about one - fourth the size of a @entity38 shuttle and use solar panels to generate power , rather than chemical fuel cells that limited the space shuttles ' time in orbit			1
neither @entity38 nor the @entity9 has plans to upgrade the @entity3 to carry people			1
a computer graphic shows what the @entity3 will look like operating in space			1
the craft took a decade to develop and is operated by the @entity9 this computer image shows the space plane re-entering @entity198			1
although it resembles a small space shuttle it is not designed to carry humans			0
it 's wingspan is a mere 4.5m with a length of 8.9m			0
it is powered by batteries and solar cells the @entity48 flight had been delayed several months pending the results of an investigation into an upper - stage engine problem during an october 4 @entity215 flight to put a @entity217 satellite into orbit			0
the @entity220 , by comparison , orbits about 250 miles high but at a much steeper 51.6 - degree inclination , or angle to the equator , that covers more territory			0
the @entity3 program , which dates back to 1999 , is operated by the @entity227 and geared toward space experimentation			1
some scientists – like @entity230 of the @entity231 – argue the @entity9 could accomplish the same objectives by using cheaper , more efficient spacecraft that either burn up on entry or parachute down			2
' the ability to return to @entity198 carries a high price , ' @entity230 said in a statement			0

@entity120 's secretive @entity3 space plane was launched into space on its third mission this *afternoon* from @entity5 in @entity23
the $ 1 billion unmanned craft is on a classified mission which the @entity9 who operate it will not *discuss*
