by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was at the helm of @entity4 when it received a £ 20billion bail out from taxpayers in 2008 the former boss of @entity4 who ran the bank while it defrauded taxpayers and racked up a £ 10billion bill for mis - selling @entity12 last night faced calls to give up his £ 192,000 a year pension			1
nicknamed the ‘ quiet @entity18 ’ , @entity2 was at the helm of @entity4 when it received a £ 20billion bail out from taxpayers in 2008			1
but the 62 - year - old , from @entity19 , has managed to maintain a low profile			1
while the disgraced former boss of @entity24 @entity23 was stripped of his knighthood and part of his bumper pension , mr @entity2 ’ £ 4million nest egg – worth £ 192,000 a year - remains intact			1
and as the bank he ran for almost a decade was fined £ 218million for an extraordinary scam to rip off taxpayers , mr @entity2 was spotted at lunch at the exclusive @entity33 in @entity34			1
this is conveniently close to the offices of consultancy firm @entity37 , where mr @entity2 is employed as a senior adviser			1
@entity4 is the first lender to be fined for an extraordinary scam which enabled it to gain tens of billions of pounds in emergency funds from a @entity42 lifeboat scheme during the financial crisis , while fiddling the system to cut the fees it paid to use the scheme			2
between april 2008 and september 2009 traders cut £ 7.8million off the fees @entity4 paid to the @entity50 by manipulating the ‘ repo ’ rate which set the level of the fee			2
@entity42 governor @entity55 has said staff involved in the scam could be guilty of ‘ criminal conduct ’			0
staff at @entity4 could also yet face a criminal investigation by the @entity60 which has been handed the evidence by @entity63 watchdog the @entity65 latest scandal has led to renewed calls to jail rogue bankers			2
although there is no suggestion that mr @entity2 was aware of the wrongdoing , it occurred under his watch			2
so too did the manipulation of @entity75 interest rates which occurred between 2006 and 2009 and for which @entity4 has also been fined			0
last night , mr @entity2 faced pressure to ‘ show contrition ’ and forfeit some his pension			1
@entity80 , a @entity82 mp and member of the @entity84 , said : ‘ the buck stops at the top			0
@entity2 should show contrition and hand back his pension			1
there should be no rewards for failure and wrongdoing			0
’ @entity92 , from campaign group the @entity94 ’s @entity93 said : ' the libor scandal and @entity12 mis - selling have rightly angered millions of customers , and given that taxpayers were on the hook for @entity4 during some of this reprehensible behaviour , many would feel better if mr @entity2 were to hand back part of his pension pot. ’ the pressure on mr @entity2 could increase tomorrow ( @entity106 ) when @entity4 is expected to announce it has set aside another £ 500million compensation for customers mis - sold payment protection insurance scandal			1
@entity82 mp @entity80 says @entity2 should ' show contrition and hand back his pension ' this will take its total bill for the scandal to more than £ 10billion			1
the state - backed lender has already punished mr @entity2 for the scandal by using its powers to recover a £ 1.4million deferred shares bonus awarded to mr @entity2 in 2010 which he had not yet pocketed			1
but it is understood to be powerless to dock some of mr @entity122 ’s pension as he is already receiving it			0
the only chance of this happening is if mr @entity2 follows the example set by @entity127 , the disgraced former chief executive of @entity128			2
@entity127 last year forfeited his knighthood and £ 175,000 of his £ 580,000 annual pension			2
he said he was ‘ deeply sorry ’ for the disaster that unfolded at the banking giant after he left in 2006			0
@entity128 was rescued by @entity4 in september 2008 after years of reckless lending forced it to the brink			0
lloyds was crippled by the toxic loans and had to be rescued by taxpayers the following month			0
the latest row comes as the @entity42 is expected to today unveil new powers forcing staff at @entity142 banks to hand back bonuses up to seven years after they have received the money - even if they have spent it			1
under the current regime , banks can only typically recover bonuses which have been awarded but not yet paid out			0
the new rules will be implemented on january 1 but will not apply to bonuses awarded before then			0
yesterday there were also calls for bankers to swear an oath to raise standards after a string of scandals			0
an extract from the oath , suggested by @entity157 , says : ‘ i will do my utmost to behave in a manner that prioritises the needs of customers			0
’ another part says : ‘ i will confront profligacy and impropriety whenever i encounter it , for the conduct of bankers can have dramatic consequence for society			0

@entity2 was at helm of @entity4 when it received £ 20bn taxpayer bail out
the 62 - year - old *'s* £ *4milllion* pension worth £ 192,000 - a - year remains intact
@entity177 claims mr @entity2 should ' show contrition and hand back his pension '
