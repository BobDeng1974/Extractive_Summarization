mrs @entity52 said : ‘ this lady has been an absolute nightmare - especially after what she has put the kids through			0
‘ she started putting letters though our door , things like what ‘ the definition of consideration ’ was and that we were making too much noise and falsely accusing us of abusing our son			2
‘ but she also accused us of poisoning her dog , things escalated to the point where one day i went to pick up my husband from work and when i came back she was hanging from the front porch			1
‘ neighbours said she was standing there waiting and when she saw us coming round the corner she kicked the ladders away , i had to cut her down , i was heavily pregnant at the time - it was awful			2

‘ she is clearly not getting the support she needs , but the mental health service say she is capable of facing criminal charges			0
