by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 13:22 est , 31 march 2013 the @entity1 will turn green due to rising temperatures within decades , warns a new study			1
the study forecasts that rising temperatures will lead to a massive ' greening ' - increase in trees and shrubs - in the @entity1			1
scientists have revealed new models projecting that wooded areas in the @entity1 could increase by as much as 50 per cent over the next few decades			1
exploring : the @entity1 could soon become greener as temperatures warm and lead to an increase in trees and shrubs the research shows that this dramatic greening will also accelerate climate warming at a rate greater than previously expected			1
lead author @entity19 , a research scientist at the @entity21 's @entity20 , said : ' such widespread redistribution of @entity1 vegetation would have impacts that reverberate through the global ecosystem			1
' plant growth in @entity1 ecosystems has increased over the past few decades , a trend that coincides with increases in temperatures , which are rising at about twice the global rate			1
the research team - which includes scientists from the museum , the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 - used climate scenarios for the 2050s to explore how the trend is likely to continue in the future			0
@entity44 and fauna : research shows that this dramatic greening will also accelerate climate warming at a rate greater than previously expected			1
the scientists developed models that statistically predict the types of plants that could grow under certain temperatures and precipitation			0
although it comes with some uncertainty , the researchers said such modelling is a ' robust ' way to study the @entity1 because the harsh climate limits the range of plants that can grow , making this system simpler to model compared to other regions such as the tropics			2
the models reveal the potential for massive redistribution of vegetation across the @entity1 under future climate , with about half of all vegetation switching to a different class and a massive increase in tree cover			1
for example , in @entity75 trees could grow hundreds of miles north of the present tree line			0
doctor @entity19 said : ' these impacts would extend far beyond the @entity1 region			0
' for example , some species of birds seasonally migrate from lower latitudes and rely on finding particular polar habitats , such as open space for ground - nesting			0
' research : the team includes scientists from the @entity21 ( pictured ) the researchers also investigated the multiple climate change feedbacks that greening would produce			2
they found that a phenomenon called the albedo effect , based on the reflectivity of the @entity97 's surface , would have the greatest impact on the @entity1 's climate			2
when the sun hits snow , most of the radiation is reflected back to space			0
but when it hits an area that 's ' dark ' - covered in trees or shrubs - more sunlight is absorbed in the area and temperature increases			0
this increases climate warming as the more vegetation there is , the more warming will occur			2
co-author @entity116 , of the @entity37 , added : ' by incorporating observed relationships between plants and albedo , we show that vegetation distribution shifts will result in an overall positive feedback to climate that is likely to cause greater warming than has previously been predicted			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity127 .			0

rising temperatures will lead to an increase in trees and shrubs in the @entity1
wooded areas in the @entity1 could increase by 50 per cent in a few decades
research shows that this dramatic greening will also accelerate climate warming
