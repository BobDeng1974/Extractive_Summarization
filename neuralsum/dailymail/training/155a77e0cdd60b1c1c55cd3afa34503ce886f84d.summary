it is a country known for @entity1 , meatballs and flat - pack furniture - and @entity4 is hoping its latest export will be just as easy to recognise			1
the @entity4 government has launched a national typeface based on ' @entity9 minimalism ' that it hopes will give its posters , signs and websites a cohesive look			1
@entity15 , which designers describe as a ' basic sans serif font with a modern twist ' , will now replace the various typefaces used by different national agencies			1
modern twist : the @entity4 government hopes @entity23 , pictured above , will give its posters , signs and websites representing @entity4 a cohesive look			1
the idea of a national font could now go global the aim is to create a single ' visual brand ' to be used when representing @entity4 internationally			1
and designers behind the font are now working on similar briefs for other countries			1
the team at @entity37 design agency @entity36 , who worked on the government brief , said that they were inspired by the national flag and vintage @entity4 signs			1
font designer @entity42 , who collaborated with the agency on the six - month project , said that @entity23 is a ' modern ' but edgy typeface			1
he told the @entity46 : ' aesthetics are very important in @entity4 and we have a long tradition of great architecture , furniture and design – so this was the natural next step			1
' ' it was a big responsibility to be representing our country , but we were really proud to be asked			0
' inspiration : the @entity37 - based designers took @entity4 's national flag , pictured , as their starting point			1
a government website said that it is ' a classic and timeless typeface ' he added that he wanted people to appreciate the look as a whole and not notice the typeface specifically			2
and mr @entity42 said that the idea of a national font could go global			2
he said : ' we ca n't name names as projects are still in their first phases , but we 're currently in discussion to do much more nation branding in the future			0
the font will now be rolled out across all government ministries and agencies			2
there is a website dedicated to ensure that all aspects of design - from colours to typography - remain consistent across all aspects of published material			2
according to the website , called @entity89 , @entity23 is ' a classic and timeless typeface that can be used in both digital and analogue formats '			0
' @entity23 is a long - term choice of typeface ; it has an unassuming character and fits well with a broad spectrum of other typefaces			0
' it then urges visitors to the site to ' always use it when communicating the image of @entity4 '			2
a new font could help make reading easier for dyslexics			0
' @entity105 ' has been designed in a way that makes it harder for individual letters to be confused - a common problem experienced by those with dyslexia			0
@entity113 designer @entity112 , who developed the font , said they often unconsciously switch , rotate and mirror letters in their mind			0
he told the @entity46 : ' traditional typefaces make this worse , because they base some letter designs on others , inadvertently creating ‘ twin letters ’ for people with dyslexia			0
' mr @entity112 has weighted his letters more heavily at the bottom and has made subtle distinctions between letters like ' b ' 'd ' and ' p ' - which can often look similar in traditional fonts - to help stop the confusion			0
other similar letters are given different heights and their proportions slightly deformed			0
there is also greater space between @entity105 letters than those in a traditional font - helping to stop letter crowding that can cause problems for dyslexics			0
studies from researchers at the @entity145 and the @entity146 have revealed that 84 per cent of readers could read text in the @entity105 font faster than a standard typeface , while 77 per cent reported fewer mistakes .			2
