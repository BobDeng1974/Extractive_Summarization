by @entity0 published : 13:24 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 16:07 est , 13 march 2014 tourists in one of the country 's most picturesque regions can now enjoy some of its most famous sites all in one go			2
one hundred of the @entity11 's top landmarks have been painstakingly recreated as a model village - entirely crafted out of locally sourced slate			1
retired builder @entity14 , 67 , has spent thousands of hours over the past 25 years making perfectly scaled models of attractions including @entity19 's @entity18 , @entity20 at @entity20 and @entity21 at @entity22			1
the village is made using locally sourced slate , from areas including @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 mr @entity14 said he started the project because he wanted to ' put something back ' into the area he loved @entity14 has spent a quarter of a century building his collection , he can now expect 6,000 visitors to come and see his handiwork every year it has taken thousands of hours of work to put the village together but new pieces are still being added mr @entity14 , 67 , said he ' wanted to put something back ' into the area he loves			1
' i wanted to show how these buildings looked when i was a lad , rather than the plastic windows and everything you see nowadays			2
' rarely using any kind of scaled drawings , much of the designs are in ' his head '			2
' i 'm not trying to be clever but i just have a knack somehow , ' he said			2
' it 's just in me , i enjoy doing it			0
' the grandfather - of - two uses a diamond saw , a hammer , adhesive , sand , cement and a special chisel to faithfully recreate every detail of the buildings			0
the retired builder uses photos for the more complex replicas but manages to put many together from memory mr @entity14 goes to great lengths and uses special tools to recreate every detail of the original buildings mr @entity14 has become too old to use his workshop , so now builds the models at home he only uses @entity11 slate from @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 but has to look as far afield as @entity75 to find the fake moss he attaches to his designs			1
every march , his wife @entity78 opens their gardens to the public as the @entity82 in @entity83			0
fourteen years since they first welcomed in the public , they now expect to pull in around 6,000 visitors annually			1
new additions to the collection this year include @entity91 's @entity90 , the roadside monument halfway between @entity93 and @entity91 , and @entity94 , near @entity26			1
the @entity96 model took mr @entity14 three months to make - using old photographs as he went along			1
he said : ' it 's quite an icon , is n't it ? i used to make them in my workshop but i 'm too old for that now			0
in winter , my wife allows me to make them in the house , which is very kind of her			0
' mrs @entity108 said : ' i think they 're marvellous			0
it takes a lot of skill and patience			0
he 's a qualified builder and you can see he knows what he 's doing			2
' as one recent visitor commented in the guest book : ' we have never seen anything like this before - it 's absolutely beautiful			0
the level of craftsmanship is amazing			0
' while the slate is all local , mr @entity14 has to ship in the fake moss from as far afield as @entity75 @entity108 first opened the model village , to show off her husband 's work , 14 years ago			1

@entity14 , 67 , has spent 25 years recreating 100 landmarks
