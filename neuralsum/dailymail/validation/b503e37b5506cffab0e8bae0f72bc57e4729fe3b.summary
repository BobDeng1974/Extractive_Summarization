a single mum is desperately saving every cent to fly to the @entity2 for her three - year - old daughter 's ear to be reconstructed so she does n't get bullied about the birth defect when she starts school			1
you would never know to meet @entity8 , from @entity9 in southwest @entity10 , that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl			1
the adorable little girl may only be able to hear from her left ear but that does n't does n't stop her great love for music and dancing			0
but her mother , @entity22 , has been on a mission since her daughter was born with microtia to get to @entity26 for @entity27 to have an operation because she ca n't have surgery in @entity30 until she is 10 years old - in seven years ' time			1
@entity32 , from @entity9 in southwest @entity10 , was born without a right ear due to a congenital deformity her mother , @entity22 ( right ) , has been on a mission to get to @entity26 for her daughter to have an operation because @entity27 can not have surgery in @entity30 for another seven years until she is 10 - years - old @entity27 loves music despite being deaf in her right ear the condition , that affects about one baby in every 8,000 - 10,000 births , is treated differently in @entity30 with medical professionals using rib cartilage from the 10 year - old patient to recreate the ear , which takes six months to recreate			1
however in @entity2 , the surgical technique uses a synthetic framework and the body â€™s own tissue to create an ear during the eight - hour operation , meaing there are no age restrictions			2
' they will use her good ear as a template and make it out of synthetic material but make it a bit bigger because ears only grow a little bit so when she grows up they will be even and they use her membrane skin to cover it , ' @entity22 explained			2
@entity27 will also need a jaw reconstruction when she is about 12 or 13 years old			0
after scrimping , saving and fundraising , @entity22 has booked her daughter in for the operation on june 2 but she is $ 20,000 short with just 10 weeks to go			1
although @entity27 is deaf in her right ear , she speaks well and has no other health complications but her mother 's worst fear is that she will be tormented when she starts school in two year 's time for looking different			1
you would never know to meet @entity27 that she was born with a congenital deformity because her confidence and lust for life is oozing out of the energetic little girl - pictured at her dance class ' with school and bullying the way it is at the moment - life is hard enough , ' @entity22 said			1
' she is so outgoing and free - spirited - it does n't hold her back - she just goes about everyday life and i do n't want that to change			0
' @entity90 from @entity91 was born with the same condition and was teased at school , and although it did n't stop the guitarist from succeeding in one of the most famous rock bands in the world , he still went ahead and had the reconstructive surgery in 1982 - almost a decade after the band formed			2
' i read that he got called things like a " one - eared freak " when he was at school and i do n't want @entity27 to get called that , ' she said			0
' as much as i can teach her to be strong - it would still be tough			0
' @entity22 's fear is that her daughter will be bullied when she starts school in another two years a fundraiser is being held on saturday to help with the last $ 20,000 needed for the $ 50,000 surgery life has been tough for @entity22 , 39 , who works full time as a sales coordinator , while her parents look after @entity27 and has done without so she can put as much as she can towards her daughter 's surgery			1
when @entity27 was one - year - old , @entity22 held a fundraiser dinner which raised $ 17,000 and she has managed to save $ 13,000 of her own money			1
she has also managed to pay for airfares and accommodation for the month - long trip			0
' it 's been hard because we ca n't do everyday things that people take for granted like going out to lunch or taking a trip , ' she said			0
' we went to the zoo last month but only because our friends had a free family pass			0
' but , @entity27 still gets to do fun activities like any other kid such as swimming and dancing lessons which she relishes			0
the condition , @entity137 , affects about one baby in every 8,000 - 10,000 births with still $ 20,000 to go , @entity22 is holding another fundraiser dinner this saturday in the hope to raise the last of the funds for the surgery			1
' i have n't even thought about what i will do if we do n't raise the funds - i will have to get it from somewhere even if i get out a loan i guess , ' she said			2
' it will change @entity27 's life immensely - it will give her a good start in life because no one will ever know			0
' ' she 's such a performer so this will help her if she chooses that path in life			0
' to buy a ticket for the three - course dinner at the @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 on saturday night email : @entity164 if you are unable attend , you can donate towards @entity27 's surgery at @entity167			2
