arriving at a reception for foster carers in @entity3 this morning , the @entity0 was resplendent in a brown silk shirt - dress			1
but while the frock might have looked a million dollars , its real price tag was a snip : £ 169 in the run - up to @entity10 but now selling for just £ 50			2
it came from what is fast becoming the @entity13 ' go - to label for everything from glamorous evening receptions to hot weather international tours - @entity18			0
' @entity21 of @entity22 likes to play it quite safe when it comes to her wardrobe , pre and post baby and @entity18 is the perfect brand for her , ' explains fashion pundit @entity43			1
' not only is it uber @entity27 , with everything designed in - house in @entity28 , it also dovetails with royal fashion protocol : not too revealing , neutral colours , and affordable			0
' as well as today 's outing , the @entity13 wore a delicate polka dot velvet top by the brand for a @entity55 reception at @entity56 in november			1
on that occasion , she deployed one of her favourite styling tricks and combined the budget top with a glamorous silk skirt by @entity63 for maximum sartorial effect			0
looking good : @entity21 last stepped out in @entity18 at a @entity55 event in november glamorous : she styled the @entity18 top with an elegant silk skirt by designer name , @entity63 elegant : earlier the same month , the @entity13 wore a black dress by the brand during a visit to @entity73 she had repeated the trick two months earlier when @entity0 , then just recovered from a bout of severe morning sickness , opted for a black dress by the label for a visit to the @entity81 in @entity82			1
partly hidden by her baby blue @entity86 coat , it was yet another example of her ability to transform a high street frock into an upscale ensemble by mixing and matching her pieces			0
but although @entity73 , @entity56 and @entity3 are the most recent outings , they are by no means the only ones for the @entity0 ' @entity18 wardrobe			1
most eye - catching was the recycled @entity18 dress , last seen in the run - up to @entity98 , for a trip to @entity100 with the result she looked both cool and practical in the baking desert heat			0
the @entity104 dress , which was worn by the @entity0 to play ping pong at a @entity28 sports club , was a bargain when she bought it and had been discounted to a cut - price £ 35 in the brand 's sale			2
but the grey and white @entity104 dress is n't the only @entity18 number to have been worn several times by the @entity0			1
one of @entity0 's cupboard staples is a £ 369 brown wool coat , bought at a cut - price £ 182 , which made its debut during a visit to @entity120 on @entity121 2012			2
chic : @entity21 wore her faithful grey and white @entity104 dress for a visit to @entity100 while in @entity125 cool : she looked cool and polished in the belted dress , despite the @entity125 desert heat first outing : the £ 35 dress was first worn to a @entity28 sports club in the run - up to the @entity98 faithful friend : this £ 369 chestnut brown coat made its first appearance in @entity120 in 2012 stylish : the coat was bought for a cut - price £ 182 and was styled with a black jumper on its first outing worn over a cosy black polo neck , the @entity0 accessorised the piece with her favourite black opaque tights and court shoes combination , a trick that she repeated today in @entity3			1
a year later and @entity0 , by then pregnant with @entity144 , was back in the same coat once more , this time for a trip to @entity147			0
although six months pregnant , she had no problems stretching the coat over her bump and even managed to fasten the belt			0
@entity18 also proved the label of choice for @entity0 's final public engagement ahead of @entity144 's birth , with the 33 - year - old opting for an eye - catching - and roomy - dalmatian - print coat			2
the £ 169 coat was worn to launch cruise ship @entity161 in @entity163 and , like everything else she wears , promptly sold out			0
' @entity18 and the @entity0 are a match made in heaven , ' adds fashion expert @entity167			2
' the label beloved by the @entity170 crew is a safe bet for the royal bump , a real go - to for classics and fashion without the inverted commas			0
' seeing double : the coat reappeared a year later when the @entity13 made a trip to @entity147 belting up : despite being six - months pregnant with @entity144 , the @entity13 was able to belt the coat show - stopper : @entity21 also chose @entity18 for her final appearance before having @entity144 sold out : the £ 169 coat worn by the eight - months pregnant @entity0 sold out straightaway			1
