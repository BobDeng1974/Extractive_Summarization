by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 04:52 est , 25 may 2012 the stubby arms of @entity2 clearly were n't its most fearsome feature - but its cousins were even weedier			2
when @entity2 and its relatives roamed @entity9 and @entity10 , the abelisaurids occupied a similar niche in @entity13 other areas of @entity14			0
they had huge jaws - like @entity2 , they relied on them to crush and kill prey , but had even tinier arms than the tyrannosaurs			1
when @entity2 and its relatives roamed @entity9 and @entity10 , the abelisaurids occupied a similar niche in @entity13 other areas of @entity14 they were the dominant predators in the @entity25 and resembled the tyrannosaurids in their general appearance , but their unusually short and high skulls were unique			1
in one respect , however , their northern counterparts could claim to be better equipped			0
though they were pretty stubby , the arms of @entity2 were much more impressive than the puny forelimbs of the abelisaurids			0
fossil material from @entity36 representing a new abelisaurid species has now thrown light on their early evolution			1
the specimen is of @entity43 age and 40 million years older than any other known abelisaurid - and it reveals that arm reduction must have begun at an early stage in the group 's evolutionary history			1
@entity50 paleontologist dr. @entity49 , who is also affiliated with the @entity51 in @entity52 and his @entity54 colleague dr. @entity53 have now discovered when the trend toward reduction of the upper extremities began in the abelisaurids			1
‘ @entity59 were a highly diverse and widely distributed group during the @entity61 , ’ @entity62 , ‘ but their origins have so far remained enigmatic			1
’ the specimen is of @entity43 age and 40 million years older than any other known abelisaurid - and it reveals that arm reduction must have begun at an early stage in the group 's evolutionary history @entity49 and @entity69 have named the new species @entity71 , or ‘ @entity76 of the @entity78 @entity77 ( @entity79 ) ’ , in recognition of the @entity74 's support for their research collaboration			1
‘ the new find reveals that the abelisaurid lineage is more ancient than we thought , ’ says @entity49			0
‘ the reason why so little is known about it is that the fossil record of predatory dinosaurs in the @entity25 hemisphere is very incomplete , especially for the period from the @entity88 to the @entity89			1
’ the researchers were also surprised to find that @entity71 had evolved on the supercontinent @entity92 before it fragmented into the landmasses we know today , and yet abelisaurids were not distributed globally			0
‘ one possible explanation is that a huge desert in @entity105 prevented dispersal of the group to the @entity9 , confining the evolution of the lineage to the @entity25 , ’ says @entity98 geological studies , together with the results of climate modeling , support the existence of such a geographical barrier			2
‘ the trend apparently set in early on , and began at the distal end , ’ says @entity49			2
in @entity71 , the upper arm is of normal size , but the lower arm is much shorter in comparison ; the hand is very stunted and the fingers and claws are tiny			0
’ @entity120 paleontologists had recently suggested that reduction in abelisaurids began with the hand , and the new data seem to confirm this			0
’ our picture of dinosaur evolution in the @entity43 is largely based on fossils from @entity131 sites , ’ says @entity49			0
‘ the @entity25 surely still has many surprises in store for us			2

' @entity59 ' had *ferocious* bite but even tinier arms
small arms began to evolve early in species history
' much still to be discovered ' about dinosaurs in @entity25
