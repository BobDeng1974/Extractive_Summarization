' mrs @entity10 , 51 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , said : ' i am haunted by the fact that more could have been done - had @entity6 not been too embarrassed to talk about his symptoms earlier			1
‘ men should not die because of embarrassment and shame			1
we talk about breast cancer and testicular cancer , so why not this ? she added : ‘ women are usually happy to talk about their bodies , but men are much more reserved and i honestly feel that attitude is costing lives and because of what happened to @entity6 i want to help change that			1
’ ‘ we ’d been married for 32 years			0
we were looking forward to retiring together , we should have been growing old together			0
‘ i could n’t stop thinking about the early days and if it could have been different if he ’d sought help and been diagnosed quicker ? ' since his death two years ago , mrs @entity10 and the couple ’s three daughters , @entity52 , 33 , @entity53 , 29 , and @entity54 , 26 , have supported the @entity31 - based @entity56 to raise awareness of male cancers			1

i fear he could have been saved ' mrs @entity10 , who works as a @entity64 receptionist , said her husband ( here on daughter @entity23 's wedding day ) put off seeing his doctor for weeks after experiencing pain in his genitals			1

she said : ‘ i noticed him wincing when he pulled his underwear and trousers on			0
a painless lump or ulcer on the penis that does n't heal bleeding a red rash under the foreskin flat growths of brownish colour difficulty in drawing back the foreskin unusual smelling discharge from under the foreskin unexplained change in colour of the skin swollen lymph nodes in the groin area ‘ when i pushed him he admitted things were uncomfortable below - he was experiencing irritation and discomfort dressing - but he brushed it off as nothing and carried on as normal			1
' later it become difficult to move his foreskin and the first procedure he underwent was a circumcision			0
' i urged him to see our gp , but like most men , @entity6 put it off			1
‘ he said he was too busy at work to take time off but i began to suspect he was also embarrassed too			0
’ mrs @entity10 says her husband , then aged 41 , was a very private man			2
‘ he was a carpenter and worked in a male dominated environment			2
' he was a very strong and solid man and just would n’t have felt comfortable talking about intimate parts of his body			0
’ it was n’t until six months later , in january 2001 , that she tired of her husband ’s procrastinating , rang their gp herself			2
she says : ‘ i offered to go with him but he looked horrified so we agreed he would go alone			0
he came back after saying he ’d need a minor operation and we both felt relieved that it was being dealt with			0
’ mr @entity6 was ' a very strong and solid man and just would n’t have felt comfortable talking about intimate parts of his body ' , his widow said following surgery the couple assumed that was the end of the matter , but after a follow up appointment mr @entity6 returned to the couple ’s home ashen faced			1
his wife said : ‘ he told me that they had performed a biopsy of cells taken from the circumcision and these had been found to be cancerous			2
july 2000 : his symptoms began january 2001 : finally went to @entity122 at wife 's insistence			1
underwent circumcision and biopsy few weeks later , which revealed cancerous cells			0
2003 : developed ulcers on his penis and returned to the gp 2004 : had more skin removed and began six - monthly check - ups november 2008 : had portion of his penis removed and reconstructive surgery february 2010 : mri scan showed cancer had spread to his pelvis august 2009 : starts chemotherapy october 2011 : passes away due to the disease ‘ i was shocked , i ’d never even heard of cancer of the penis			1
’ but medics assured the couple they were confident all the cells had been removed			2
however a few months later , mr @entity6 developed ulcers on his penis			1
this time he went straight to the @entity122 , who diagnosed cancer of the penis			1
more surgery at the @entity31 and @entity175 followed but the diseased tissue kept reappearing over the following years			0
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ it nagged in my mind that treatment had been delayed because he was too embarrassed to see the doctor			2
i wished i had pushed him into going sooner			0
’ by november 2008 , consultants decided drastic action to try and keep the cancer at bay was the only option - and decided to amputate a portion of the organ			2
mrs @entity10 recalls : ‘ i gripped his hand but he did n’t flinch at all			0
i knew to him it was the ultimate indignity but he was determined to keep strong and brave for me			2
‘ i told him i did n’t care about anything as long as he was well			2
’ despite the severity of his condition , mr @entity6 continued to insist to his daughters he was fine			1
‘ that was typical of him , he would not have wanted his girls to worry about him , ' said his wife			2
' as far as he was concerned it was his job to worry about them , not the other way around			0
’ despite battling chemo that left him exhausted and sick , mr @entity6 wrote a speech and walked daughter @entity53 down the aisle on her wedding day mr @entity6 was such a private man that he told colleagues the reason for his hospital appointments was a bad leg - rather than his rare cancer when he needed to take time off for hospital appointments , he told colleagues he had a bad leg - because he was too embarrassed to admit the truth			1
' the seven - hour operation to remove a portion of his penis and lymph nodes in the groin was a success and he underwent reconstructive surgery at the same time			2
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ he really did n’t look any different too me and when he was strong enough , intimacy was normal - but that really had been the least of my worries			0
’ but in early 2010 mr @entity6 reported pain in his hips and thighs and was sent for a ct scan - with devastating results			1
it revealed a tumour on his pelvis and a consultant confirmed the cancer had spread and was now incurable			0
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ i broke down in tears when he said the only option was treatment to try and extend his life			0
' but @entity6 just asked when could he start - i had never seen such bravery and courage			1
’ mr @entity6 succumbed to the disease in october 2011 , after battling an infection in hospital the family are now supporting the @entity31 - based @entity56 to raise awareness of male cancers			1

despite battling chemo that left him exhausted and sick , he wrote a speech and walked her down the aisle			0
he later told me he would n't have missed it for the world			0
' over the following months , the father - of - three 's health faded and in october 2011 he was admitted to hospital battling an infection			1
when treatment failed , his family was warned they were losing him			0
mrs @entity10 and her daughters kept vigil , sleeping in their cars at the hospital to be nearer to him			0
it was daughter @entity53 who was sleeping in a chair by his bedside when she woke to see her father had stopped breathing in his sleep			0
her mother said : ‘ she phoned us and we raced upstairs to her			0
it was typical of @entity6 to go quietly in his sleep with no fuss			2
it was the way he would have wanted			0
‘ i kissed him and told him how much i loved him			0
’ mrs @entity10 said : ‘ it was @entity54 ’s way of having her father involved in her day and i know he would have been bursting with pride ' but as she planned his funeral mrs @entity10 felt cheated - and wished her husband had sought treatment sooner			2
' so when fellow cancer patient @entity297 - whom @entity6 had grown close to in hospital - launched a charity to raise awareness of male cancers , mrs @entity10 and her daughters offered their support			1
