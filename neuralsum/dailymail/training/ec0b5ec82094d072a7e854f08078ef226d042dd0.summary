the lawyer helping @entity1 publish a sequel of to kill a mockingbird has detailed for the first time how she discovered the long - lost novel			1
in an interview with the @entity9 , @entity7 said she was doing some legal work for @entity1 one morning last summer when she started looking through an old manuscript titled ' @entity12 '			1
at first she thought it was an unfinished version of @entity1 's only novel , but then she realized that the main character @entity16 was older and the setting about twenty years later			1
' i was so stunned			0
at the time i did n’t know if it was finished , ' @entity19 told the @entity9			0
so she called @entity1 and asked if the book was finished			1
' she said , " complete ? i guess so			0
it was the parent of “ @entity3			0
her lawyer @entity31 ( right ) found the long lost manuscript last summer , while doing some legal work for her famous client while the upcoming publishing of @entity37 has been heralded as one of the biggest discoveries in literary history , many have expressed skepticism that 88 - year - old @entity1 is lucid enough to have supported the decision			1
when @entity3 became an instant success in 1960 , @entity1 vowed to never publish again saying : ' i wrote one good book and that was enough '			1
as the woman who both discovered the novel , and is helping to publish it , @entity47 has become the target of some of these conspiracy theories			2
for year 's , @entity1 's sister @entity54 protected her authorial rights as a lawyer with the firm @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity1 and @entity47 in @entity60 , @entity61 - the same law firm their father helped found			1
to kill a mockingbird follows a young girl named @entity16 as she grows up in a small southern town during the depression			0
@entity1 's follow up , go set a @entity37 , also focuses on @entity16 , but twenty years later			1
on the right , the design currently being used to sell pre-orders of the book on @entity72			2
it 's unclear if this is the finished design but when @entity76 passed away last november , it was @entity47 that took over as the author 's champion			2
sources close to both @entity47 and @entity1 have mostly defended the release of @entity37 , though it breaks with the author 's previous vow not to publish again			1
@entity84 , a former newspaper reporter and a longtime friend of @entity47 , said friday that the attorney was trusted implicitly by @entity76 and in turn by @entity1 , whom locals call by her first name , @entity91			2
' she 's not some interloper , ' said @entity84 , who came to know @entity47 and the @entity93 during two decades of covering southwest @entity61 for the @entity94			2
' she 's been part of the inner circle for years			0
' @entity1 used to split time between @entity97 and @entity61 but has lived full - time in @entity60 , halfway between @entity98 and @entity99 , since suffering a stroke in 2007			1
she was last seen publicly at her sister 's funeral , where she talked loudly to herself about seemingly unrelated things in a manner that alarmed those present , according to several who were there but insisted on anonymity for fear of upsetting those close to the family			0
but historian @entity112 , another longtime friend of the sisters , said he visited @entity1 the day before the deal was announced , and found her completely lucid , cracking jokes and discussing the works of @entity118 , though she did n't mention her own new book			1
' this narrative of senility , exploitation of this helpless little old lady , is just hogwash			0
it 's just complete bunk , ' @entity112 said , adding that he has ' no reason to question @entity31 's integrity			0
' it 's important to note , @entity112 said , that ' @entity54 brought her in , kept her as a partner			0
she let her work increasingly with @entity91			0
' the 88 - year - old @entity1 is nearly blind and deaf and lives in an assisted living center in town			1
relatives and others close her typically do n't comment about publicly about her in deference to the publicity - shy author 's wishes			1
@entity47 fits the mold : she has n't responded to interview requests			0
@entity1 's sister @entity76 helped protect her sister 's authorial rights for years , but passed away in november			1
@entity47 took over representing @entity1 's to kill a mockingbird interests after that			1
@entity54 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) @entity1 pictured above on september 11 , 2006 - @entity54 's 95th birthday with a title taken from the @entity149 book of @entity150 , ' watchman ' will be released in july and already is no. 1 on @entity72 based on pre-orders			1
the new book is set about 20 years after ' @entity3 , ' in which attorney @entity154 defends a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman in the 1930s			0
in the sequel , @entity160 's daughter , @entity16 , returns to her @entity61 from @entity97 to confront attitudes and feelings about her childhood home			2
' i 'm alive and kicking and happy as hell with the reactions of ' @entity37 , '' the author said in a statement relayed through @entity47 and attributed to her thursday by the publisher			0
@entity47 handled @entity76 's will following her death			0
then , as @entity1 's attorney , one of their first salvos was a lawsuit in may 2013 against the son - in - law of a former literary agent , which restored control of the copyright for ' mockingbird			1
' some have remained skeptical about the sequel 's upcoming release , since @entity1 previously vowed never to publish again			1
the author pictured center at the assisted living home where she 's a resident in @entity60 , @entity61 @entity47 had signed a document in which @entity1 had reaffirmed her desire to give away the rights , but @entity47 also fought to restore those same rights to @entity1 , according to the complaint filed on @entity1 's behalf by a @entity97 law firm			1
@entity1 then sought a trademark for ' to kill a mockingbird ' items , like the knick - knacks sold in a town museum that includes displays about the book			1
the museum opposed the trademark request , and then it too was sued by @entity1 , accused of wrongly selling ' @entity3 ' memorabilia without authorization and without paying royalties			2
@entity84 , whose parents were eulogized by @entity47 and her husband @entity209 following their deaths , said the proliferation of ' @entity3 ' related products was part of the reason @entity47 advised @entity1 to more aggressively protect her interests and income after her sister 's retirement			1
' @entity91 was fiercely protective of the characters in her book while @entity54 was handling things , ' @entity84 said			0
' as things have unfolded , @entity7 took action			2
i ca n't imagine anyone looking out for the interests of the book and for @entity91 who would n't do the same			0
' the lawsuits were settled , but more controversy erupted last year when author @entity230 published her book ' the @entity232 : life with @entity1			1
' the former @entity235 writer had moved next door to the sisters in 2004 and documented their quiet lives in the city that inspired @entity3 , the setting in the novel			0
@entity1 released a statement through @entity47 saying the book was n't authorized , prompting @entity76 to send her own hand - written apology to @entity230			1
in it , @entity76 said @entity47 had created the statement , and had @entity1 sign it			2
' poor @entity248 ca n't see and ca n't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence , ' her sister wrote			0
' now she has no memory of the incident			0
' to kill a mockingbird was turned into a film in 1962 , starring @entity256 as @entity16 's lawyer - father @entity154 @entity76 describes confronting @entity47 in the letter , provided to the @entity258 by @entity230 , and said the whole episode left her ' humiliated , embarrassed and upset about the suggestion of the lack of integrity at my office			1
' @entity76 died at 103 on nov. 17			0
it was also in the fall , according to the publisher , that @entity47 found an unpublished manuscript of ' @entity12 ' attached to an original typescript of ' to kill a mockingbird			2
' @entity84 , who now works for the south @entity61 town of @entity272 , rejected suggestions by some that @entity47 was trying to personally profit from legal disputes involving @entity1 , or the new book			1
' i think if there were a motive of greed , family members would have stormed in to put a stop to things , ' said @entity84			0
' i have not seen that happening			0
' jree it was @entity47 who filed @entity76 's will in @entity287			0
@entity1 left her estate to relatives and made donations to organizations affiliated with the @entity292 , in which she was heavily involved			2
@entity1 was among the relatives who signed documents waiving their right to receive notice of probate proceedings about the will , witnessed by @entity47 and signed by @entity76 in 2009 while she was still practicing law on a limited basis			2
such waivers are common and typically signal that relatives wo n't contest the will			0
@entity1 has received honors including the @entity303 in 2007 and the @entity304 in 2001 , but even then , she was n't much for speaking			2
asked to make remarks at the state ceremony , she said simply : ' well , it 's better to be silent than be a fool			0
