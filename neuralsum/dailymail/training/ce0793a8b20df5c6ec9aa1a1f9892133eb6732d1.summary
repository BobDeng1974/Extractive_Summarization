herd : photographer @entity19 was hovering over the coast in a single - engine plane when he spotted the walruses clustered on the iceberg ' i was sat in a single engine plane with the door 20 miles off shore from the coast of @entity11 in the @entity9 , ' said @entity19 , 43			1
' i was completely amazed when we got to ice floes where there was nothing but open water to the west and it was fantastic to see all the walruses on the ice			2

' @entity40 ' : dozens of the mammals are seen piled onto an iceberg floating in the @entity9 , 20 miles off the coast of @entity11 mr @entity19 , from @entity45 , near @entity46 , @entity47 , said there were walruses of all ages on the floating ice , including a few large bull walruses			1
' the island is a safe resting place that acts as a houseboat and moves them around their feeding grounds , ' he said			0
' this way it helps them as they do not over use and feed for too long in a certain area on the sea floor below			0
' it was simply an amazing sight and it was definitely something that i have never seen before			0
' i like the light , the shapes of the ice , and the massive amount of walruses on them			0
