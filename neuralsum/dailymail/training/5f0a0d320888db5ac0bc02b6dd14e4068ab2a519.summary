a newly - discovered dinosaur species has been named after the little girl who stumbled across its remains when she was just five years old			1
palaeontologists announced this week that fossilised remains found on a stretch of @entity8 beach in 2008 had been finally identified as a new species of flying dinosaur			1
the remains were discovered by @entity12 , who , now aged nine , has amassed a collection of fossils and animal remains so extensive it led one expert to describe her bedroom as ' resembling a natural history museum			1
' @entity12 with her collection of fossils , stuffed animals , shells and bones an artist 's impression of a crow - sized species of prehistoric flying reptile dating from 115 million years ago which was discovered by @entity12 , five , who is to now have the species named after her as @entity33 she made the find on a family walk along along @entity36 on the south coast of the @entity8 , close to their home in @entity39			1
@entity40 spotted the remains and realised it was a fossil , and the family took it to dinosaur expert @entity45 , who recognised its potential importance			1
for the past five years , experts @entity49 and @entity51 have painstakingly studied the fossil , focusing on even the most smallest of details , before eventually publishing their findings this week			2
they revealed the creature was roughly the size of a crow and was a previously unknown type of pterosaur			2
the family has donated the remains to the @entity63			1
and when it came to naming the creature , the experts looked to its young finder for inspiration , officially dubbing it @entity12			2
a children 's book has even been written about her as a result , called @entity40 and the @entity75 - with the title based on the translation of @entity12 or @entity78			2
@entity36 : @entity40 made the find on a family walk along along the beach on the south coast of the @entity8 , close to their home in @entity39			1
' when i told my friends about it they said it was cool , ' said @entity40 , a pupil at @entity89 is well known for her unusual collection			2
@entity12 was roughly the size of a crow and was a previously unknown type of pterosaur			2
the flying reptile is from 115 million years ago in the lower cretaceous period			1
with a pelvis length of 40 mm , the new animal would have had a total length of 350 mm , and a wingspan of 750 mm , the researchers say			2
the pterosaur has now been donated to the @entity63 which recently named the @entity8 as the ' dinosaur capital of @entity103 '			1
while many girls her own age choosing to cover their wall with posters of pop stars , @entity40 has dedicated her room to the study of animals and dinosaurs			0
@entity113 , 44 , said : ' she is fascinated by it			0
' if we are in the car and we go past an animal that has died , she 'll ask me to stop so we can pick it up and she can take it home			0
' she 'll put them under a crate in the garden and let it decompose			0
' the flies lay eggs and maggots clean the skeleton , then she collects the bones			0
' if your child is good at drawing or dancing and they enjoy it , then you encourage them and this is what @entity40 enjoys , so her @entity139 and i have never said eurgh , we 've tried to encourage her			0
' rather than say that 's disgusting , we 'd like to help her find out about things			0
she 's fascinated and we 're very proud of her			0
' when she was just six @entity40 contacted @entity142 to ask the experts how long it would take for a dead mole she had found to decompose			0
@entity12 , who aged five discovered a species of prehistoric flying reptile dating from 115 million years ago the far - from - squeamish youngster also has the skull of bull , she keeps in the living room , and several mummified animals , including a frog and a shrew			1
knowing of her unusual interest , neighbours sometimes bring round the bodies of birds their cats have killed , while friends and relatives will sometimes animals remains to her in the post to add to her collection			0
@entity45 , who himself has a collection of 50,000 specimens he hopes to soon house in a purpose - built centre on the @entity8 , said @entity40 's discovery had been vital			1
' it 's likely that if she had not picked this up , it would have washed away that day and might never have been found			0
' it shows how amateurs and academics can work together and make some really important discoveries			0
the bones found by @entity12 which led to the discovery of a new dinosaur the bones found by @entity40 are part of the dinosaur 's pelvis ' she is a fascinating and unique girl			1
' she has an amazing collection of real and fossilised bones , shells , skulls and teeth and her bedroom now resembles a natural history museum			0
' ' when @entity40 and her family brought the fossilised remains to me in april 2009 , i knew i was looking at something very special - and i was right			1
' the fossil turned out to be a completely new genus and species of small pterosaur , a flying reptile from 115 million years ago in the lower cretaceous period , which because of the island ’s eroding coastline , would without doubt have been washed away and destroyed if it had not been found by @entity40			1
' it just shows that , continuing a long tradition in palaeontology , major discoveries can be made by amateurs , often by being in the right place at the right time			0
' the pterosaur has since been donated to the @entity63 which recently named the @entity8 as the “ dinosaur capital of @entity103 '			1
and @entity40 does n't plan to stop any time soon			0
' i just want to keep collecting things , " she said .			0
