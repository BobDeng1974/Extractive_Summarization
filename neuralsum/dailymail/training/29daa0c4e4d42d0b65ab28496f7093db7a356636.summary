‘ we want this word to be policed from the parking lot to the equipment room to the locker room , ’ he continued			2
‘ secretaries , pr people , whoever , we want it eliminated completely and want it policed everywhere			2
’ the @entity0 declined to comment , but told the site workplace ‘ respect ’ is a key aspect of changes the league is seeking to make in the fallout from the @entity21 bullying and @entity58 scandals			1
@entity35 said that next month ’s competition committee meeting is the first step to making the penalty the law of the land			2
‘ i think they 're going to do what needs to be done here , there is too much disrespect in the game , ’ he added			2

‘ with any rule that we put into play , we have to look at it from a to @entity89 and find out what are the unintended consequences as much as the consequences , ’ he said , according to @entity0			2
‘ but as it was stated in our meeting , there are mics everywhere , ’ @entity82 added			0

so , it would be an opportunity to get it verified if we had to			0
’ @entity82 , one of only seven black @entity102 's in a predominantly @entity78 league with 32 teams , also expressed a desire to see the rule further discussed			1
former @entity108 great @entity107 , now the executive director of the @entity15 , told the @entity110 that use of the word already results in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty , but that more needs to be done			0
‘ it needs to be put a halt to in the locker room , on the field , whether it ’s staff , whether it ’s a player , there is no room for it , ’ said the @entity115			0
infamous : @entity125 wide receiver @entity58 was caught using the word at a concert , he received no fine or penalty for his actions , he also did not miss a single game fans who spoke to the paper had mixed reactions			1
‘ i am sure that word gets thrown around all the time every game so how would you even enforce that ? ’ @entity108 fan @entity139 wondered aloud , adding ‘ i do n’t think it should be banned			0
’ a friend of @entity139 ’ said ‘ the whole idea is stupid			1
’ a @entity125 fan told the paper he is in favor of policing the word ’s use			0
‘ there are a lot of ways to trash talk without saying certain words to people … the players will learn to comply with the rules			0
’ @entity58 , who plays for the @entity125 , was infamously caught on video repeatedly shouting the slur at an @entity78 security guard while attending a concert at the team ’s stadium prior to last season			1
@entity164 reactions ranged from surprise to calls of hypocrisy as many compared it unfavorably to the ongoing @entity170 name saga			1
‘ saying the n - word on the field is a 15 yard penalty			0
wearing a racial slur on the front of your jersey ; totes cool , ’ a fan wrote			0
hypocritical ? : many fans wondered on social media how a racial slur - @entity170 is a derogatory term for @entity183 - can be used as a team name but not spoken on the field ‘ please tell me the @entity0 is n't seriously considering a penalty if a player says the @entity189			1
games would take 6 hours , ’ said another			0
‘ latest @entity0 recap : n - word , 15 - yard penalty ; r - word , marketed ; caught dragging unconscious fiancé out of elevator , employed			0

the rule must be backed by the competition committee to go to the owners for a final vote , which would take place prior to the upcoming season .			1
