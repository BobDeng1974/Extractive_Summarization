teachers rushed to help @entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , who dropped to the floor as she played ball with her fellow first - graders at @entity15			1
@entity16 and @entity17 recognized that @entity9 was in sudden cardiac arrest and made the wise call to implement their medical emergency response plan and immediately administer cpr before attempting to move her			1
saved : @entity9 , pictured in hospital , suffered two heart attacks after warming up for gym class four years ago			1
the 10 - year - old is now a charity campaigner proud pair : @entity9 and her father @entity30 are raising awareness of her condition which can cause a sudden cardiac arrest			1
she was lucky teachers were on hand after suffering an episode four years ago their actions saved the life of the little girl who was later diagnosed with a rare heart condition called catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or @entity42 , which can trigger cardiac arrest at any time			1
' if they 'd waited five minutes , @entity9 would n't have survived , ' her father @entity45 said at the time			2
' i was completely unaware that her school had a plan , ' he told @entity50 today - the fourth anniversary of the incident			2
' it 's not something i thought to ask , but i am so thankful they did			0
cardiac arrest is n't rare , survival is			1
' on february 13 2009 , mr @entity45 and his wife , @entity58 , did n't realize anything was wrong with their little girl beyond the usual ' coughs and colds '			0
in fact , two days before she had been given the all - clear in her annual check up			0
but when he received the call from her school that afternoon he knew something was n't right			2
battling illness : now 10 , @entity9 fund - raises for the @entity71 and calls for schools to be trained in dealing with conditions that cause sudden cardiac arrest ' you dread getting that phone call from the school			1
i remember every word , ' said @entity9 , a part - time bartender			2
' i knew it was n't just that she fell over and hurt her leg			0
' it turns out their youngest child was carrying a potentially fatal heart condition which kills 30 per cent of those in their first attack			1
teachers at her elementary school kept her alive before medics arrived with a defibrillator			2
in hospital she suffered another cardiac arrest and was put on life support			1
her family were unsure of what her condition would be when she regained consciousness			2
life - saving school : two teachers at @entity15 , pictured , saved the life of @entity9 four years ago when she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest warming up for gym class she was unable to walk and had issues with short term memory loss but miraculously has since achieved a full recovery			1
@entity9 , now 10 , and her family are promoting awareness of the illness and the work of the @entity71 which is researching the condition			1
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or @entity42 is a condition where the rhythm of the heart is disrupted it is thought to be the cause for 15 % of all unexplained cardiac arrests in young people it is linked to moments of physical activity or emotional stress and in the majority of cases has a genetic cause sufferers are advised to avoid all forms of vigorous physical activity and can be implanted with devices to measure the heart and given beta - blockers sufferers have a tendency of fainting during exercise and often have relatives who have suffered from similar symptoms or sudden cardiac arrest			1
however , for many the first sign of the illness is a sudden heart attack sudden cardiac arrests claim the lives of 300,000 a year in the @entity149 alone they also want to draw attention to the need for emergency medical response plans in schools			1
' it can happen again at any time , ' said mr @entity45			0
' all you can do is be prepared for it			0
' @entity9 now wears an implant to keep track of her heart rhythm and to automatically shock it back if she goes into cardiac arrest			1
' sometimes in gym , she 'll say , ' i 'll need to sit this one out , ' when her heart is racing a bit or she is feeling a little faint			0
but it does n't happen very often , ' mr @entity45 added			0
' initially , she was concerned that that she was n't like everyone else -- that she was different , somehow			0
so i say , ' you are different because this happened to you			0
' let 's look at the positive side of what you can do			0
' ' she is getting the word out that school staff should be trained in @entity178 , and schools should have @entity180 and an emergency medical response plans			1
she 's putting herself out there			0
' the family are still concerned they ca n't find the origin of @entity9 's illness			2
the condition is usually genetic but she was tested and nothing came back positive			0
that 's why they are backing research by the @entity71			0
' although it is comforting to know that she is getting the correct treatment , not having a diagnosis is still a big worry , ' mr @entity45 told the charity 's blog			0
' @entity9 has a 15 year old brother , @entity198 , and not having a diagnosis for @entity9 means that he could also be carrying the same genetic problems			2
he could just be a time bomb waiting to go off			0

@entity9 was 6 when she suffered a **random** cardiac arrest in her school playground and was saved by teachers using cpr
she suffered another heart attack in hospital but managed to survive
she was diagnosed with fatal condition @entity42 which causes **random** and sudden heart *failure*
now 10 she and her family campaign for medical training in schools and to raise awareness of the condition which kills a third of those who experience an episode
