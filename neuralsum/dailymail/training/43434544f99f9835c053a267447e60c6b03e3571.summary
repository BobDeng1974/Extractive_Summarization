@entity1 boss @entity0 looks set to make a renewed move for @entity4 ’s @entity3 in january			1
in what was one of the ‘ will he ? wo n’t he ? ’ transfer sagas of the summer , the @entity7 kept the @entity1 waiting until the final week of the window before telling them he intended to stay with the @entity12 club , who had accepted a £ 14million bid for the striker			2
@entity3 had enjoyed a season - long loan spell at the @entity17 , and @entity0 remains an admirer			1
@entity3 has only started once in the @entity19 for @entity4 this season after deciding not to join @entity1 on a permanent deal in the summer @entity3 was on loan at the @entity17 last season and @entity4 accepted a £ 14m bid from the @entity1 @entity1 travel to @entity4 on saturday and @entity0 is hoping that a good reception from the travelling fans could let @entity3 know he is still appreciated on @entity28			1
‘ i hope our fans will give him a terrific reception , ’ said the @entity29			2
‘ i would like them to because he deserves it			0
he is one of those players who , for some reason , everyone thought would be here so we never really wanted to say goodbye to him			0
but he is not here so it is a good opportunity for us to say thank you to @entity3			2
’ @entity3 scored 10 times for @entity1 last season and , without his guile , they have failed to net in seven of their 14 league matches this term			1
the striker , who opted to stay and fight for his place at @entity12 , netted 10 times for @entity1 @entity0 admits that his side have missed the @entity7 striker 's goals this term @entity0 admits he has been a miss. ‘ goals are very expensive so we have missed him a lot , ’ he added			1
‘ i think we are learning now but the higher you go there are some players when you know them well they become a little bit more expensive			0
when you know a player and you know what you are going to get in any division it makes a difference			0
’ @entity3 has appeared eight times for the @entity75 this season , starting only once in the @entity19 , and @entity0 says he would have perhaps been better placed under his care			1
‘ in terms of quantity of games he probably did not make the right decision , ’ he said			0
‘ in terms of quality probably yes , because he has played in the @entity84			0

@entity3 spent last season on loan at @entity1 and scored 10 times
the @entity7 has found opportunities hard to come by at @entity4
@entity0 admits @entity1 have missed the striker 's goal this season
