mrs @entity11 ' doctor , dr @entity82 described the baby 's prospects before his birth to @entity88 2 @entity78 @entity87 : ' it looks like , on ultrasound , that there are some loops of his bowel and intestine in there but also some portion of his liver			2
' the concern with these types of defects , she explained to @entity88 , is that until delivery , there is no way to know if the baby 's lungs have been able to grow to capacity			0
medical mystery : a medical drawing shows how an @entity21 baby is born with a transparent sack on the outside of the body carrying the organs brave : @entity116 ( right ) walks to the delivery room ahead of her c - section as doctors and family silently hope that the baby 's lungs have not been critically impacted by the defect warmer : the baby was promptly slipped into a type of sealed plastic bag so as not to lose his body heat or any fluids but remaining upbeat before her february c - section , smiling mother - to - be mrs @entity11 told cameras : ' i am nervous but it 'll be a good day			1
' heading to the delivery room ahead of schedule due to high blood pressure , she and her husband were surrounded by a team of doctors and nurses ready to ensure the baby 's survival			0
to everyone 's relief , @entity23 let out a few strong screams as he exited the womb showing no signs of the potential heart and kidney trouble that can have fatal results for a newborn @entity21 at birth			2
moving on : @entity23 is transferred to the @entity152 at @entity153 nearby for monitoring sweet : but not before a tender moment with his mother ' really the test is when he 's here how he does , so it 's always very reassuring when babies come out and they cry , ' dr @entity82 said			0
' once he got over here he needed a little bit more help with his breathing so he has a tube down his windpipe			0
' @entity23 was immediately slipped into a medical zip - lock bag to preserve body heat and fluid and after a tender moment between mother and child , he was rushed to the @entity175 at nearby @entity153 , where he will be monitored			0
write caption here friends forever : the couple 's dog @entity177 waits patiently for his new roommate ' we have every expectation that he 'll be the little boy that we 're soon to discover			0
really no anticipated downside to him , ' dr @entity82 reassured			0
in about a year , @entity23 will have the sack of organs tucked back into his body and his life will resume as normal			1
' @entity189 , absolutely amazing , ' a proud mr @entity1 gushed post-labour when asked how he felt			2
' just so relieved , ' he added .			0

@entity11 was born with a birth defect known as an @entity21
the *danger* of organs growing on the outside of the body is that lungs are unable to develop properly
@entity0 and @entity1 from @entity14 welcomed their first son at @entity39 , @entity40 where experts have delivered similarly *afflicted* babies
the otherwise healthy newborn will have the sack of organs *put* back *inside* his body in about a year
