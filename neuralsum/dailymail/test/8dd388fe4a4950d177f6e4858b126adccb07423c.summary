they are a stunning visualisation of the art - and how it is orange			2
a programmer has created these stunning graphs to reveal the dominant colour of artworks through history they show @entity10 has always been the most popular colour - although in recent years blue has begun to catch up			1
the software extracts the relevant colour information from images or artworks found online			1
the plot above is based on 94,526 images for the years 1800 - 2000			1
the graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the @entity23 , with all colours increasing except for orange			1
' i made a visualization of the change in colors of paintings over time , ' said @entity31 , a phd student in psychology at the @entity33 who created the graph			0
to do this , he wrote software first to scrape the images of the paintings from sites where they were available for free download - @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity45 commons , and various museums			2
then , the software extract the relevant colour information from them , and plots it in a nice way			2
he found the paintings change over time - from orange to blue			1
' the changes in color might be a results of a combination of factor , ' he wrote			0
' one of these could of course be trends in the use of colour			2
' if we assume a smooth linear deterioration of certain colours in oil paintings , it would be possible to subtract that change and study the short term fluctuation in colour use			1
' for example the marked increase of blue at the time of the @entity75 , might actually reflect a true trend in colour use			1
' two versions of @entity81 's sunflowers painting on show at the @entity83 in in @entity84 , @entity85 : @entity87 and orange are the most popular colours in artworks from 1800 , it has been found			1

' there are a bunch of different sites where you can access ( photos of ) paintings , for instance the @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity45 commons , and various museums			0
. ' one of my favorites is the @entity40 's site where you can browse through over @entity108 of well organized paintings - an amazing resource			0
' for many of these there is also information on the year they were painted , the artist , etc. ' he believes that some experts who have claimed perhaps the change is due top the price of paint are wrong			0
' i have nâ€™t found any data on the prices of blue , so that explanation is hard to elaborate on			0
' however , it is not only blue that increases but all colors except orange , which might speak against the pigment prices explanation			0
' the same graph , but with only oil paintings ' @entity130 ' by @entity131 : researcher have found orange is by far the most common colour in art.			0
