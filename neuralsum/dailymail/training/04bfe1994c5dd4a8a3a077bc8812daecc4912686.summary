by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:25 est , 28 february 2014 when @entity4 first had blonde hair extensions fitted , she felt like a @entity7 princess			1
but her fairytale turned sour when she attempted to blow - dry and straighten her new locks			0
the reason ? because the hairdresser who had fitted the extensions - which were meant to last for three months - had used wax bonds instead of glue to hold them in			1
worse still , she had failed to tell @entity4 , a 21 - year - old actress , that if she applied heat to the wax bonds they would melt			1
bad hair day : @entity4 had long blonde hair extensions fitted using wax bonds , left , when they melted in the heat , she had to pull them out leaving her with bald patches , right painful : @entity4 pulled her own hair out along with the extensions instead , @entity4 found out the hard way when she attempted to use straighteners to spruce up her locks			1
' it was great waking up feeling like @entity28 with long , blonde hair , ' explains @entity4			1
' but when i went to straighten my hair , the wax bonds started to melt			1
my hair started matting and sticking together			0
' panicking and in pain from the melting wax on her head , @entity4 tried to pull the extensions out but in doing so , ripped out much of her own hair			1
she recalled : ' i had to pull my own hair out to remove the extensions			2
i could hear it ripping , it was horrible			0
i was in total shock			0
' brittle : celebrity stylist @entity43 was alarmed at the condition of @entity4 's hair brave step : @entity47 had to let @entity43 cut her hair right back to remove the damaged locks far from having the thick , bouncy mane she so wanted , @entity4 was left with thin , brittle hair and bald patches where her hair had been pulled out			2
the situation left her terrified of returning to a hairdresser and low in self - esteem - both of which had a knock - on effect on her job as a singer and actress			0
she said : ' i 've had to put my career on hold because i do n't have the confidence to audition			0
' after countless home conditioning treatments failed to revive her locks , @entity4 sought the help of celebrity stylist @entity43 on @entity69 show @entity70			2
@entity43 was alarmed by the state of @entity4 's hair and told her only drastic action would help			0
she would need to have as much of the matted , brittle hair cut away as possible			0
then she would need to add some more hair extensions to give it length - but this time she would use ones from made from real hair that would be attached with heat resistant glue			1
revived barnet : @entity4 was left with brittle , thin hair after her extensions disaster , left , but now has a sophisticated new look to complete @entity85 's make - over , she also used a softer blonder shade of dye on the naturally brown - haired actress , instead of her previous bleached blonde look that was also damaging her hair			1
despite reservations about having her hair cut back and then having to wear extensions again , @entity4 was delighted with her new look			1
she exclaimed : ' it 's a major improvement i like it			0
the colour is so much better			0
i love the cut it looks so much more healthy and is going to be easy to manage			0
she told @entity43 : ' thank you , you have pretty much saved me life			0
' for the benefit of those considering extensions , she warned : ' always get a professional to do your hair			0
' cool crop : the actress 's confidence has been restored source : @entity114 one such professional is @entity116 , a hair extensions expert and owner of @entity119 and blush salon in @entity121			1
' permanent hair extensions are a very safe way of adding instant length to your hair - when fitted at a professional salon with expertise in hair extensions , ' she explains			1
' unfortunately there are cheap , poor - quality products available within the hair industry that some salons choose to use			0
when these cheap substitute products are used , clients invariably have issues			0
' and it seems @entity4 is n't the only one to have endured a hair disaster caused by dodgy extensions			1
' we have many clients who come to us seeking help with poor - quality hair extensions that they had fitted elsewhere , ' adds @entity116			1
' we advise that they never try to remove the hair extensions themselves , or return to the salon where they had them fitted for a removal			1
we remove their hair extensions very carefully and gently , usually taking several hours to do so			2
' these clients usually do not lose any of their own hair and are relieved to have the waxy hair extensions removed			2
' many clients then choose to have good - quality micro ring hair extensions fitted			1
we offer to fit test hair extensions , using small micro rings , so clients can wear them at home and see that they are both safe and comfortable			2
' micro ring hair extensions are the safest type of permanent hair extensions method available			2
there is no glue used with this method and so the fitting and removal is very clean			0
micro ring hair extensions last for three months and should be removed by a professional			2
' @entity4 appears on @entity70 , tonight at 8pm on @entity69			0

@entity4 , 21 , had blonde hair extensions fitted with wax bonds
but the hairdresser failed to tell her not to get them *hot*
when she straightened hair , the wax melted , leaving it matted and painful
she tried to pull out the extensions but ended up ripping out her own hair
