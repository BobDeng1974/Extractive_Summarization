photographs of @entity3 's iconic @entity2 peak have revealed the astonishing extent of @entity6 's historic drought			1
the images , which show the peak in the third week of march each year between 2011 and 2015 , reveal how swiftly snowfall has depleted year to year			1
the snow is typically at its deepest in the area in late march and , as seen in the 2011 photograph , it previously covered peaks including the @entity2			2
but this year , the fourth consecutive year of drought in @entity6 , the 9,000 - foot peak does n't bear a single flake of snow			1
earlier this month , officials reported that the @entity22 snowpack , which gives an indication of upcoming water supply , is just five per cent of its normal depth - and barely above the record low set in 1991			0
the lack of water comes after the winter of 2014 was the hottest on record for @entity6			1
farmers have said they expected to leave as much as a million acres unplanted , nearly twice the amount of last year , the @entity49 reported			0
' it looks like we are on our way to the worst snowpack in history , ' state climatologists @entity52 told the @entity49			0
' unless we end up with some particularly good snows here in march , we are going to end up with a new lowest rank here			0
' but the @entity2 peak is likely to stay clear of snow because there are no major snowstorms forecast for the rest of the month			0
earlier this month , the @entity66 noted that as well as @entity6 , droughts are ravaging @entity22 and @entity68 and also parts of @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
the photographs were taken by the @entity3 webcam provided by @entity34 , which is funded by donations			0
while all years show the peak on march 19 , the 2014 image shows it on march 17 as a march 19 photograph was not available			2
warming temperatures : but by march 2013 , the peak is drastically different - with far less snow as temperatures stay higher depleting : the following year , 2014 , also shows far less snow than in previous years as drought ravages states on the @entity88 dry : by march this year , the fourth consecutive year of drought in @entity6 , the peak barely shows a flake of snow			1

images taken in the third week of march each year between 2011 and 2015 show stark difference in snowfall
it comes as @entity6 *battles* the fourth consecutive year of drought following record hot temperatures in 2014
