@entity0 would not be able to stop a @entity2 invasion of @entity3 because of years of military cuts , one of @entity7 ’s top generals has warned			1
general sir @entity8 , who stepped down from his post as @entity0 deputy supreme commander earlier this year , said the military alliance needed to rearm if it was serious about defending itself in the future			1
asked about the crisis in @entity15 , he said : ‘ the reality is that @entity0 would be very hard pressed and they would find it very difficult to put into the field , at sea or into the air the means required , particularly on land i would assess , to counter any form of @entity2 adventurism			1
the move is an attempt to deter @entity2 president @entity40 from causing trouble in the former @entity44 @entity43 republics , according to mr @entity29			2
he said the organisations 's summit in @entity47 next week would overcome divisions within the alliance and agree to new deployments on @entity2 's borders – a move certain to trigger a strong reaction from @entity54			1
he also outlined moves to boost @entity15 's security , ‘ modernise ’ its armed forces and help the country counter the threat from @entity2			1
during the @entity60 the @entity44 had a buffer zone of ' @entity63 ' allies , separating its border from the capitalist world @entity2 has become increasingly concerned over the growing strength of @entity0 , which has spread east his former colleague @entity68 , speaking on @entity67 last night , said @entity0 needed urgent investment			1
he said : ‘ certainly western @entity3 would not be able to defend in my view against @entity2 without significant support from the @entity73			2
‘ @entity0 would find it really difficult to get a division ( 20,000 people ) out of the door in quick time			2
‘ because certainly in western @entity3 what we have seen progressively is a dismantling of military capability			0
’ @entity82 will host next week 's @entity83 in @entity47 amid warnings over @entity2 aggression in @entity3 he accepted that advocating rearmament would be unpopular , but added : ‘ it is a message our political leadership need to take home and listen to and act on if they are serious about ensuring that @entity0 has the means to defend itself in the future			1
‘ if @entity0 is serious about this , it is going to have to rearm , it is going to have to rebuild capability			2
@entity95 nations are going to have to put their hands in their pockets to spend more money on defence			0
’ currently just four out of the 28 members spend more than the minimum target of two per cent of gdp on defence			0
asked about the situation in @entity109 , sir @entity8 stressed the threat posed by @entity111 , formerly known as @entity112 or @entity112 , had to be eradicated			1
he told the programme : ‘ the first priority is to protect but ultimately the priority must be to eradicate is as an external threat because of the potential impact on the @entity118 ... but also its potential impact if its incubus is allowed to survive ... on our external security			0
there is ( also ) a very clear issue as far as internal security is concerned			0
’ when questioned about whether this meant siding with president @entity128 in @entity129 , he replied : ‘ there can be no eradication of @entity111 as a threat without a regional approach			0
‘ is is operating and has spread into @entity129 and therefore there is likely to be or inevitably going to be a need to sit down and talk to difficult bed fellows , bad people			0
‘ it is one thing to say that we are going to deal with it , but you have to back up your words with actions and therefore in my view we should rule out nothing			0
‘ we must apply all the levers of power , political , diplomatic , economic and of course of military , but above all we need to establish the international political will to deal with this			0

general sir @entity8 said @entity0 needed to rearm to counter @entity2
comes after @entity0 said it will deploy forces at new bases in eastern @entity3
move comes *ahead* of next week 's @entity83 in @entity47 over @entity15 crisis
