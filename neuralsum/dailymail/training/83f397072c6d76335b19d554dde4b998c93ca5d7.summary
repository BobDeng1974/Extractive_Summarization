by @entity0 published : 12:59 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 16:07 est , 13 august 2012 @entity1 are claiming that @entity3 ’s elderly will have to choose ‘ between medicine and meals ’ if @entity6 and his running mate @entity7 unseat president @entity8 in november			1
the emotive message , which is also pushed in a new @entity8 campaign internet ad , is designed to paint @entity7 , who has tabled proposals for reforming the @entity13 programme for the elderly , as a callous extremist			1
@entity16 , chair of the @entity17 , told @entity18 that electing @entity6 and @entity7 would ‘ force us back to the days ’ when seniors were ‘ choosing between medicine and meals … choosing between healthcare and paying their rent ’			1
@entity38 , a @entity33 congresswoman , denied she was being dramatic			0
‘ if you go back to before @entity13 was a safety net in place for our seniors , you had seniors who were not able to pay for their own health care needs , whose children went medically bankrupt trying to care for them			2
’ the charge is based on @entity7 ’s budget reform plan that would gradually increase the @entity13 eligibility age to 67 , starting in 2023 , and replace the current system with one based on vouchers			1
truth team : the advert features @entity33 residents discussing what they think of @entity6 and @entity7 this means that the plan , designed to be a long - term way of reducing @entity3 ’s almost $ 16 trillion national debt , would affect no one currently aged 55 or over			1
@entity7 has said that those approaching retirement have planned their lives around @entity13 in its current form and it would therefore be unfair to change the plan			1
but the @entity8 campaign is clearly implying that if @entity6 is elected then the @entity13 programme will be jettisoned			1
in a web ad sure to be followed by a television blitz , the @entity8 campaign presented a number of older floridians bemoaning what they said was @entity7 ’s plan to end @entity13 and makes the same claim @entity38 made			1
controversial : the ad is an only slightly subtler version of one released last year in which a man resembling @entity7 pushes an old lady in a wheelchair over a cliff this means that the plan , designed to be a long - term way of reducing @entity3 ’s almost $ 16 trillion national debt , would affect no one currently aged 55 or over			2
@entity7 has said that those approaching retirement have planned their lives around @entity13 in its current form and it would therefore be unfair to change the plan			1
but the @entity8 campaign is clearly implying that if @entity6 is elected then the @entity13 programme will be jettisoned			1
the ad is an only slightly subtler version of one produced by the @entity93 last year			0
in it , a slim , dark - suited man resembling @entity7 pushes an old lady in a wheelchair to a rocky ledge and tips her over it so she plunges to her death			0
at the end , the ad asks ‘ @entity109 without @entity13 ? ’ and gives out the phone number of @entity7 ’s office , urging voters to ‘ ask @entity7 and his friends in @entity108 ’			2
the ad ran in @entity111 , @entity33 , @entity112 and @entity7 ’s home state @entity32			0
fighting : the ad attacks @entity3 @entity31 presidential candidate @entity6 ( right ) and his vice presidential running mate @entity7 ( left ) in their first joint interview , with @entity116 , @entity6 and @entity7 defends their stance on @entity13			1
@entity7 said : ‘ my mom is a @entity120 in @entity33			0
‘ our point is we need to preserve their benefits , because government made promises to them that they 've organised their retirements around			0
in order to make sure we can do that , you must reform it for those of us who are younger			0
and we think these reforms are good reforms			0
’ @entity6 said : ‘ there 's only one president that i know of in history that robbed @entity13 , $ 716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call @entity141			2
‘ what @entity7 and i have talked about is saving @entity13 , is providing people greater choice in @entity13 , making sure it 's there for current seniors			1
no changes , by the way , for current seniors , or those nearing retirement			0
battle : @entity6 's campaign has released ads criticising @entity8 but looking for young people down the road and saying , “ we 're going to give you a bigger choice ”			0
in @entity3 , the nature of this country has been giving people more freedom , more choices			0
that 's how we make @entity13 work down the road			0
’ @entity38 said that she had not one but two parents living in @entity33 and on @entity13			0
‘ both my parents are on @entity13 and live in @entity33 too and i can tell you that my parents and hundreds of thousands of seniors that i represent are deeply concerned that @entity7 and @entity6 want to turn @entity13 into a voucher programme			1
’ @entity13 , she said , was ‘ a guarantee for seniors that there is going to be a safety net through which we ’re not going to allow them to fall ’			2
@entity6 and @entity7 had ‘ embraced ending that guarantee – @entity7 ’s the architect of ending it ’			2
