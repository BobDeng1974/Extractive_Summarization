@entity8 , 32 , was left fighting for his life after suffering multiple injuries in the head - on smash in november			1
@entity12 , 35 , rushed to be by his side and waited anxiously for signs of recovery			1
but she was admitted as a patient herself to @entity18 in @entity19 , when she started suffering contractions two months before she was due			1
@entity8 and wife @entity12 in hospital together after the birth of their baby @entity24 , more than two months early			1
the couple believe the early labour was triggered by the shock of mr @entity8 's major accident @entity12 and @entity30 - are all now recovering in neighbouring wards at the @entity19 hospital after four days of complications , she gave birth to daughter @entity24 - their first child - by emergency caesarean section and was immediately taken to recover on a ward with her husband lying beside her			1
now all three of the family are recovering in neighboring wards and face a @entity44 in hospital			1
but the couple still insist they are ' the luckiest people in the world			2
' mr @entity8 , a fisherman , said : ' the last two weeks have been the lowest and highest points of my life			1
i ’m just so happy to be here at all			0
' ' the nurses rushed me into the lift and got me to the maternity ward			0
a couple of @entity58 nurses got me down there like a bat out of hell			0
' i was in the delivery room on one bed and @entity12 was on the bed next to me			1
it was amazing what they did for us - it ’s never happened before , apparently			0
' we ’re convinced it was the stress of the crash that brought on the contractions			0
' as soon as the baby arrived i just forgot about everything			2
we could n’t have asked for a healthier baby			2
' mr @entity8 nearly lost his life when his silver @entity77 was involved in a head - on smash in @entity19 , @entity79 , on november 17			1
he had dropped off a workmate when his car was hit by a black @entity82			0
little @entity24 was two months premature and was whisked straight to an incubator after she was delivered by emergency caesarean section the two men in that vehicle escaped unhurt but mr @entity8 's passenger suffered a chest injury and fractured sternum			1
rescuers then spent two hours carefully freeing mr @entity8 , of @entity19 , from the wreckage of his car			1
he said : ' the roof was one inch clear of my head			2
the police said if i was in a different car i would ’ve died			0
' he shattered his right leg , ripped muscles in his neck , fractured his hip and damaged his finger			0
he was rushed to @entity18 and underwent the first of four emergency operations			0
surgeons fitted metal pins to re-attach 20 pieces of bone , stitching his leg back together with dozens of thick staples			0
the couple now face @entity44 in hospital while little @entity24 , mother @entity12 and father @entity8 recover mrs @entity114 said when she received a phone call from the scene of the crash telling her that her husband was trapped in she had feared the worst			1
after racing to the hospital she watched helplessly as her husband recovered from the serious surgery in intensive care			2
then six days later , in what experts believe was delayed shock , she began to have contractions despite not being due to give birth until january 24			0
she was then officially admitted to the hospital where her bed - bound husband had asked hospital staff to be on 24 - hour standby to whisk him to the maternity ward			2
four days later , in the early hours of thursday morning , he was told his baby was on the way and was wheeled down in his bed to the birth			1
mr @entity8 was not allowed into the operating theatre as doctors performed a caesarean section on his wife			1
but within minutes of tiny @entity24 arriving at 4lbs 60z @entity12 was wheeled back into the delivery suite where mr @entity8 was waiting			1
the proud father was allowed to see his daughter briefly before she was whisked off to an incubator			0
she faces a further four weeks in hospital and is on a drip in intensive care but is perfectly healthy			2
the whole family are preparing to spend @entity44 in hospital as they each recover , and mr @entity8 faces six months of operations and rehabilitation before he will be able to walk again			1
but last friday he was able to hold little ‘ @entity152 ’ for the first time after leaving his bed in an adapted wheelchair			0
he said : ' i was in massive discomfort but when i got down there i did n’t feel the pain			0
' she ’s just amazing			0
her whole hand is as big as my thumb			0
every single thing that ’s happened to us , it ’s the mathematical equation of a miracle , really			0
' mrs @entity114 , who is in a wheelchair and recovering in hospital herself , said she felt blessed that both her husband and daughter had survived			2
she said : ' it ’s been a pretty horrific few weeks but now we have a baby			2
' i ’m the luckiest person alive at the moment			0
i thank my lucky stars every day			0
it could have been a totally different @entity44			1
