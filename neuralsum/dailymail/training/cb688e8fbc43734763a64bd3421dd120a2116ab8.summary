but after nearly 200 years of being kept at @entity13 in @entity14 , the whale 's historic home is to be restored			1
@entity16 technician @entity15 with the skeleton of the sperm whale at its final resting place in @entity14 the 58.5ft skeleton was visited by @entity9 in the 1800s when he came to @entity22 to research @entity3			1

the stable block at the grade one listed stately home , where the whale is now housed , will benefit from £ 417,800 of funding			1
the sperm whale became a national sensation after it was washed up on a beach at @entity37 and found by a local woman on april 28 1825			1
tourists travelled from far and wide to gawp at the astonishing sight , hacking off bits of the carcass to take home as souvenirs before science arrived at the scene			2
@entity48 doctor @entity47 performed a dissection on the beach and his findings were the talk of the @entity52			0
after providing one of the first scientific studies of a whale , the remains were claimed by the @entity57 family , who occupied the hall for 700 years			1
the family also owned the title to the lord of the @entity61			0

the passage states : ' moreover , at a place in @entity14 , @entity22 , @entity73 by name , a certain sir @entity57 has in his possession the skeleton of a @entity82			1
' sir @entity57 's whale has been articulated throughout ; so that , like a great chest of drawers , you can open and shut him , in all his bony cavities - spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan - and swing all day upon his lower jaw			0
an 1825 illustration of the beached whale that inspired @entity3 , based on a drawing by @entity106 of @entity107 ' locks are to be put upon some of his trap - doors and shutters ; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side			0
' sir @entity57 thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column ; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum ; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead			0
' the remains of the skeleton were recovered from the park in 1995 and are now exhibited in the @entity130 in the stable block			0
the estate is now owned by the @entity13 which manages it as a museum			2
director dr @entity135 said the award was ' a fantastic opportunity ' which meant the ' renaissance ' of the @entity139 and its surrounding parkland could continue			0
repairs will start later this year on the stable block which includes stalls , grooms ' quarters and the stable master 's room			0
it consists of two buildings arranged around two courtyards , one to stable riding and carriage horses , the other to accommodate farming stock			0

' this project , once complete , will bring to life the important role that horses played in our social and economic history , ' she added			0
records dating back hundreds of years outline claims of various whales coming ashore , including sperm whales , which were the most valuable because of their oil .			2
