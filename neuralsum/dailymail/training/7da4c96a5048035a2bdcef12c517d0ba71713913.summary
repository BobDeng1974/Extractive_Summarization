a recently - imposed ban restricting large cruise ships from passing through @entity3 ’s historic city of @entity4 has been lifted			1
the city ’s regional court of appeal overturned the regulations , which were only implemented in november , and which prevented all ships over 96,000 gross tons from sailing along the @entity10 to the city ’s main cruise terminal			1
it also limited the number of ships over 40,000 gross tonnes from sailing along the route to just five a day			0
no more : large cruise ships will longer be able to sail in @entity19 's basin and the @entity20 the restrictions were imposed after stars including @entity23 and @entity24 added their signatures to a petition calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as @entity31			1
however , while the move paves the way for the towering vessels , dubbed ‘ skyscrapers of the sea ’ , to once again sail through @entity4 , no changes will be seen in the near future			2
the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , which represents 53 major cruise lines , said itineraries for 2015 had already been finalised and larger ships would continue to steer clear of @entity4 for the rest of the year			1
among those above the 96,000 @entity46 limit are @entity47 ’ @entity50 and @entity51 , @entity49 and @entity52 as well as some @entity53 and @entity54 vessels			0
plea : @entity56 stars @entity23 , @entity57 and @entity24 signed a petition in june instead , the cruise lines have agreed to wait for an alternative route to @entity4 ’s cruise terminal to be drawn up and investigated			1
an environmental impact assessment on its construction is expected in march while the project would require an estimated 18 months for completion			0
‘ we acknowledge and respect the verdict of @entity69 ’s @entity68 , ’ said @entity39 , in a statement			0
stunning views : there has been a long - standing concern the ships might cause damage and omit smog ‘ @entity39 and its member lines have chosen to voluntarily refrain from bringing ships above 96,000 tons to @entity4 until a new navigational route becomes operational			1
‘ we are looking forward to welcoming a final decision by the @entity3 government on the alternative route for big ships in @entity4			1
’ the restriction had been put in place to prevent damage to the fragile buildings and environment in @entity4			1
environmental groups have been protesting against the large ships for a number of years citing the destruction and potential for flooding of the historic landmarks			0
however , the tribunal was urged by numerous tourism groups and the @entity98 ( @entity99 ) to overturn the ban , with ports and cruise industry employees arguing that the ships bring in millions of euros to the @entity4 economy			1
the huge cruise ships have been criticised for dwarfing @entity4 's byzantine architecture the @entity99 had predicted losses of just under 300,000 passengers a year as a result of the ban			1
meanwhile , @entity112 's president of the @entity3 @entity113 was reportedly appalled by the decision , claiming that the public interest should take precedent over cruise ships			0
last year , the number of cruise ships sailing through @entity4 was capped at 708 , compared to 809 in 2012			2
the huge liners dubbed the ' skyscrapers of the sea ' have been able to pass within 1,000ft of the iconic @entity123 , granting a stunning view to those aboard but dwarfing @entity4 's byzantine architecture			2
the decision comes after @entity23 and @entity24 added their signatures to a petition calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as @entity31			2
the huge liners dubbed the ' skyscrapers of the sea ' have been able to pass within 1,000ft of the iconic @entity123 , granting a stunning view to those aboard other big - screen figures also on the list of endorsees included @entity140 , @entity141 , sir @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
@entity146 , whose most iconic film – the 1973 supernatural thriller @entity149 – was set in @entity4 , also signed the petition			2
the open letter , penned by the celebrities and addressed to the @entity3 prime minister , read : ' having prevailed against flood , pestilence , and war for more than thirteen centuries , @entity4 , the @entity158 , and unparalleled @entity112 word heritage site , now , in a moment of relative tranquility , finds herself mortally threatened by the daily transit of gargantuan ocean liners , indifferent to the probable risk of catastrophe			0
' since the flood of 1966 , @entity3 and countless @entity3 and international supporters have contributed to the defence of the world 's most fragile city , eternally subject to destruction			0
' the absolute lack of respect presented by the outlandish spectacle of the ongoing obstruction and potentially destruction , of one of humanity ’s pre-eminent monuments is not only dumbfounding but both morally and culturally unacceptable			0
' we urgently request an immediate and irrevocable halt to the traffic of the @entity183 in front of @entity185 and along the @entity20 putting an end to this senseless devastation			0
