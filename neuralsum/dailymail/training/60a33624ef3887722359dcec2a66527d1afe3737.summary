by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 25 october 2013 a top secret 20ft long panorama of the @entity3 coastline taken during daring spy missions just months before @entity5 has emerged for sale almost 70 years later			1
the photos were snapped by highly - skilled @entity9 pilots who recorded the landscape as seen from the sea ahead of the pivotal beach invasion			1
the annotated images identify key landmarks along the five - mile section of ' @entity17 ' beach , where @entity19 troops landed on june 6 , 1944 and where around 1,000 people lost their lives			1
top secret : this is part of a fascinating 20ft - long panorama of the @entity26 coastline taken during daring spy missions just before d - day , which will be sold at auction next week vital preparations : this photograph from 1944 shows a @entity19 amphibious tank going ashore on @entity33 on @entity5 at the portion of the beach near the one above the archive is made up of 21 plates , each measuring 8ins by 11ins			1
when pieced together they make a panorama that is almost 20ft long			1
officers studied them to familiarise themselves with the landscape and to look for where @entity44 gun emplacements were and beach exits for the soldiers			2
they would also have been used to create highly detailed maps and three dimensional models of the @entity5 landing zones			0
marked on the pictures , which cover the coastline from @entity53 to @entity54 , are landmarks including a tower , a lighthouse and a coastguard station			0
key target : the town of @entity53 was one of the key targets on june 6 1944 and this annotated images identifies its key features incredible : spitfire pilots and other planes and vessels used sophisticated technology at the time to plot exactly a five mile stretch of beach and surrounding hills occupied by the @entity44 detail : an officer has written on this photo and highlighted the lighthouse at this point on the @entity3 coast , stitched together to form part of a giant panorama dangerous : this is the beach at @entity83 , home to one of the a huge gun battery that could fire on both @entity17 and @entity87 beaches , making it one of the key targets at the start of the invasion important : @entity92 , pictured here from the sea , was considered an key foothold for the @entity96 just east of the heart of @entity33 plot : the @entity44 were completely unaware that this plotting of the landscape was taking place and it formed a key element of the june 1944 invasion into battle : the images are being sold by the son of captain @entity107 , commander of infantry landing ship @entity108 ( pictured ) in the @entity5 operation the photos were taken by brave airmen who flew just 10ft above the sea , 1,000 yards from shore and in broad daylight			1
they are being sold by the son of captain @entity107 , commander of infantry landing ship @entity108 in the @entity5 operation			1
the ship carried two companies from the @entity119 onto @entity33 , where they went on to capture their targets of @entity53 and @entity122			2
daunting : this series of pictures taken on the eve of @entity5 shows how high the cliff were along @entity33			0
at points soldiers were forced to climb them , with some reaching 200ft detail : part of the success of d - day was the amount of planning that had been involved			0
the @entity96 carefully plotted landmarks and buildings , like the @entity137 here , to ensure soldiers were fully prepared when going into battle remarkable : @entity141 had accurately plotted the length of @entity33 ( pictured ) , by putting together small photographs to make a 21ft panorama that could be viewed like a soldier coming in from the sea history : the scene and memorial at @entity53 ( @entity17 beach ) , with the remains of @entity152 a temporary harbour used by the @entity19 and @entity154 to bring in troops and equipment after d - day captain @entity107 passed the images on to his son as a keepsake following the war			1
at the heart of the plan on d - day was @entity33 and the neighbouring @entity166 because it was where the @entity96 wanted to set up temporary harbours after the invasion			2
this meant the @entity96 could land troops , vehicles and equipment on @entity26 soil without having to capture a port first			2
@entity177 , as it was called , was installed at @entity166 , for @entity179 invasion forces ; @entity180 was set up at @entity53 ( @entity33 ) for the @entity19 and @entity154			2
the pre-fabricated harbours were towed across the @entity182 in chunks and put into place on the @entity3 beaches			1
the @entity152 harbours were completed by may 1944 and successfully launched with the use of tug boats soon after			0
it allowed 220,000 men , 50,000 vehicles and 600,000 tones of supplies to be landed in @entity26 and undoubtedly helped win the war			0
the photographs are tipped to fetch Â£ 400 when they go under the hammer			0
@entity198 , curator of the photographic archive at the @entity200 , said the spy photos were commissioned by the @entity202 , a joint intelligence organisation , and taken in march 1944			2
mr @entity198 said : ' in the run - up to @entity5 the @entity202 used reconnaissance photos such as these along with other sources of information to build up a complete picture of the area			2
' highly - skilled pilots would fly very low level missions in @entity9 , @entity211 or @entity213 planes to get the photos needed			0
' they were very dangerous sorties			0
' the pilots not only faced the possibility of attack from @entity44 planes and flak from ground troops but also the inherent dangers of flying 10ft above the waves			1
' the planes had cameras mounted in the noses and it was vital the pilots got pictures of every inch of coastline			0
' to avoid arousing suspicion among the @entity44 as to where the landings were going to take place , photos were taken of the coastline from @entity3 right up to @entity237 and @entity238			1
' these particular photos show the @entity17 area from @entity53 - @entity241 to @entity54			1
' as well as highlighting primary landmarks , the images would have been used to identify the location of @entity44 emplacements and possible beach exits			1
' they would have been seen by only the highest ranking officials and from them highly detailed maps and 3d models were drawn out and handed to officers			0
' these photographs formed a very significant part of this historic mission			0
' the images are being sold by @entity258 - based @entity257 auctioneers			1
mr @entity257 said : ' the photos themselves are fairly unremarkable but what they represent is astonishing			0
' the archive will be sold at @entity257 in @entity258 on october 30 .			0

allies stitched together the photos to form a 20ft panorama of @entity3 coast to prepare for invasion of @entity17 beach
images were hand annotated to show key targets and dangers to ensure the troops were fully prepared for battle
the secret *artefact* has been *unearthed* by son of a senior @entity280 man and is to be sold at auction next week
