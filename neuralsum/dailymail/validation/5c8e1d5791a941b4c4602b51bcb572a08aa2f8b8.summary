an undercover investigation in @entity1 has revealed the disgusting conditions in which a wildly popular snack known as ' @entity4 ' are made			1
the food - made from flour , spicy oil and food additives - is especially popular among young adults and children due to their cheap cost , but reports in the media of them causing extreme sickness have prompted concern			2
the snacks are popular among @entity1 people living abroad , with thousands of people ordering them via online marketplaces such as @entity21 - and there was even an online campaign recently to promote the red sticks among @entity25			1
the most popular brands sell more than 400,000 packets a month , solely online			0
but many consumers have reported suffering from severe sickness and diarrhoea after eating them , and one three - year - old girl was reportedly left with festering sores around her mouth after gorging on the snack			1
@entity48 reported that , during secret , filming at one of the many firms which produce the snack , investigators found one worker handling food with a finger that had blistered through exposure to the chemicals used in the process - without wearing protective gloves			1
at the factory in @entity62 , @entity63 , an undercover reporter saw workers visit dirty lavatories and return to work without washing their hands - again without wearing gloves or face masks when handling food			1
this three - year - old girl allegedly developed sores and ulcers after eating too many of the snacks roaring trade : they are popular on online sites such as @entity21			1
( there is no suggestion the product pictured here was manufactured at the plant in the undercover filming ) the finished product was also packed with bare hands , with workers ' hands stained by the red oil that coats the food - leading at least one woman to suffer sores on her finger			1
when challenged as to why they were n't wearing gloves , staff said they slowed down their work			2
boxes used to store the snacks were also seen covered in an oil - like substance , while a choking smell filled the entire site			0
close to the production line were various boilers , pipes and a large metal drum filled with a reddish liquid that emitted a strange smell as well as a small bucket that was full of black sludge			0
the manufacturer , @entity110 , shared the premises with other businesses and there was evidence of paint particles spreading into the @entity117 workshop from a toymakers next door			0
it comes after a toddler in the city of @entity123 was hospitalised with severe sores and ulcers which were caused by eating too many of the sticks , reports @entity48			2
and one blogger claimed he suffered five hours of diarrhoea after eating 10 of the sticks in quick succession to test their effect			0
stomach - turning : many consumers have reported suffering from diarrhoea after eating @entity4 stench : the undercover reporter said a vile smell came from vats holding chemicals like the one above @entity140 : @entity1 fans of the snack have been encouraging westerners to try it and posting their comments online many consumers who have bought the snack online have also left comments reporting similar symptoms			1
@entity1 fans of the snack had recently started an online campaign to make it popular with @entity25			1
a site showing pictures of @entity156 workers in @entity1 eating the sticks - known in @entity158 as ' @entity159 ' - alongside their thoughts on them , gained a large following			2
among the comments on the site were ' latiao is taking over the world ' and ' we 've found the weapon that will defeat @entity168 '			0
but the campaign that included plans to formally export the spicy snack abroad ended this week as quickly as it started , after the images of the manufacturing process emerged			0
@entity1 media have reported several scares in the past in which the snack had been accused of being unhealthy and even causing cancer			0
the authorities claim they are working to crack down on breaches of hygiene and safety regulations among food producers			0
according to the latest report by @entity186 , there were 15 brands of @entity117 on the banned foods list because they exceeded acceptable levels of acid , bacteria or other chemicals			0
in 2011 , 53 manufacturers of the snack were ordered to shut down by the @entity195 , but critics claim many firms continued to operate illegally under new aliases			0
a manager claiming to be in charge at @entity110 told the undercover reporter : ' we are checked regularly by the authorities and there are areas that we fail on			2
if you are talking about washing hands , changing clothes before going to the toilet ... then the workers will find this very constricting and it will be difficult to recruit for this work			1
