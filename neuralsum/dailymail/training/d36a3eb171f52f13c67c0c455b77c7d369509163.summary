stomach - churning footage shows scenes filmed from helmet cameras of @entity13 and @entity14 as they cheat death by squeezing through a gap just a few feet wide			1
as they approach the @entity35 capital it appears one of the jumpers is about to suffer a fatal accident by colliding with one of the city skyscrapers			2
