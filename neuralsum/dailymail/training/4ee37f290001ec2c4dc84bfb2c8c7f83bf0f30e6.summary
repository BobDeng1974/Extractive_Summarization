’ sickle cell anaemia is an inherited genetic blood condition			0
people with the condition have sickle haemoglobin ( @entity223 ) , rather than regular haemoglobin ( @entity225 ) - the protein in red blood cells which carries oxygen			0
regular red blood cells can easily bend and travel around blood vessels without any problems - but sickle haemoglobin sticks together when giving oxygen to tissues			0
this makes red blood cells sickle - shaped and less able to move			0
they can easily block small blood vessels and this prevents oxygen from getting through and can damage organs			0
sufferers should avoid wearing tight clothing , dehydration and cold temperatures - as well as maintaining a good diet			0
it was suggested that the reason for this was because gunmen in @entity2 will target the innocent if they can not find their intended victim			0
