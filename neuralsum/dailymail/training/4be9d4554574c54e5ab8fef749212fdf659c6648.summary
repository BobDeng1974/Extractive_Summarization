a @entity1 university is planning to create a ' @entity2 ' consisting of the frozen dna of every creature that has ever lived			1
@entity5 has received the country 's largest - ever scientific grant to embark on the project , which is scheduled to be completed by 2018 and will be based in a 430sq km site on campus			2
the institute , which has received 1billion rubles ( £ 12.6million ) to help get it off the ground , aims to cryogenically freeze and store cells which are capable of reproducing			1
the ' @entity2 ' project aims to collect cellular materials from every creature to have ever lived @entity18 , the university 's rector , likened the gigantic project to a modern - day ' @entity2 ' , @entity17 reported			1
he explained : ' it will involve the creation of a depository - a databank for the storing of every living thing on @entity28 , including not only living , but disappearing and distinct organisms			2
' it will also contain information systems			0
if it 's realised , this will be a leap in @entity1 history as the first nation to create an actual @entity2 of sorts			1
' the announcement marks the latest , and most ambitious , of the world 's dna banks which have increased in numbers in the past decade following breakthroughs in technology and growing concern about species extinction			1
these are known as frozen zoos - the most well known of which is that at @entity47			0
staff at the research centre have sperm , dna and other animal matter frozen in liquid nitrogen since 1976			2
it currently holds about 8,400 samples from over 800 species			0
@entity57 also maintains the @entity58 , which is run by a consortium of biological societies , zoos , museums and research facilities			0
its website states preserved viable cells will enable biologists to ' reverse the dangerous loss of genetic variation that can cause infertility and early death in breeding programmes '			0
the enormous dna database will be held in a building at @entity75 ( pictured ) it holds a remarkable 28,604 frozen dna samples , of which more than 7,000 are from species on the ' red list ' of endangered animals			0
this includes the @entity82 , the @entity83 , the @entity84 , the @entity85 and @entity86			0
but @entity1 's historic @entity2 project is not the first of its kind for the country - a storage facility in the remote @entity93 wilderness aims to use the natural cold of @entity93 's thick permafrost to preserve seed and plant samples for up to 100 years			1
at least 1.5million seeds from plants and vegetables will be housed in the cryostorage unit in @entity102 , protecting many of the world 's important foods and endangered plant life against climate change , war , and disaster			1
there is already a small unit containing 100,000 samples ( pictured ) on the site , but a new extension will mean many more seeds can be stored			0

the world 's most ambitious dna bank will be created at @entity1 university
its *directors* aim to freeze biological matter of every creature to have lived
the *landmark* project has received 1billion rubles ( £ 12.6m ) in *funding*
*nicknamed* ' @entity2 ' , it will be used as a ' databank ' of cellular materials
