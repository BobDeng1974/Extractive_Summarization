if you were described as average - looking , you probably would n't see it as a compliment			1
but perhaps you would be happy if you looked like any of these computer - generated depictions of the ' average woman '			1
with flawless skin , youthful faces and bright eyes - these average faces of women from around the world are nothing short of beautiful			1
the face of the average woman from a variety of countries including @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 has been deduced by scientists hundreds of images of women 's faces were laid on top of each other before a computer programme created the average around a focal point of their eyes they were created from hundreds of pictures of women from all over the world			1
using a face - averaging tool hosted online by experimental psychologists at @entity39 , women from 41 different nationalities and ethnicities were used for the experiment			1
the tool is a modern version of the technique that anthropologist sir @entity44 pioneered in the late 19th century , multiple images were carefully laid over one another using a computer technology			1
using the eyes of the women as a focus , it then worked out the average look of each woman from every region but analysing their faces			1
the method - called ' composite portraiture ' - and was first used in the 1880s by sir @entity44			0
the social scientist and cousin of @entity59 first created the image of the average face by superimposing multiple portraits of individuals			1
some have been critical of the average images , saying - as the results all appear to be around 20 years old - they do not reflect any age range within a country those behind the project say that the method averages the shape of the features before blending the images together - hence why there are no blemishes or imperfections the technique has been used ever since , particularly in the study of ' attractiveness ' - which studies people 's perception of beauty			1
however , the results have attracted some controversy - with many saying the results do not reflect reality especially as the ' common ' faces are all beautiful			2
while many agree that it does make sense the women are all pretty - because averages rule out blemishes - many are perplexed that the women all seem to be in her early twenties - not the average age of any nationality			1
those behind the project say that many of the criticisms are explained by the process			0
instead of having a lot of blurry images with undefined features , they say the method averages the shape of the features before blending the images together			2
some anomalies can be explained by how the pictures were compiled			2
the prevalence of mousy hair is a result of blondeness being easily ' diluted '			0
other results also suggest that the study has a few imperfections			0
the average @entity120 , for example , should not be pale - skinned as only 9.2 per cent of the population define themselves as white			2
the project was inspired by @entity120 photographer @entity125 's project called the face of tomorrow and used techniques developed by social scientist @entity44 the project was inspired by the work of @entity120 photographer @entity125 - who created a web project several years ago called the face of @entity131			2
the project saw the photographer compile a collection of people 's faces from various cities for a final project while he was studying at @entity138 in @entity139			0
he said : ' sitting on the underground train , i was intrigued by the sheer diversity of the place – @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and a hundred other nationalities vying for their place in the metropolis			0
' i thought : “ what is this place , what is a londoner ? ” ' i thought if one could merge all the people in a place like @entity139 one would be looking at the future of that place – one would have some notion of what a @entity139 is or will become			0
' anthropologist sir @entity44 - who was also the cousin of @entity59 - pioneered the method of ' composite portraiture ' in the 1880s			0
he superimposed multiple portraits of individuals ' faces together to create an average			1
all of the portraits were registered on the subject 's eyes and the rest of the face was created around them			0
the faces have been the topic of fierce debate over the last hundred years , with much psychological research focusing on the attractiveness of the face and why different people find one more attractive than the other			0
other psychologists , including @entity181 in his work on dreams , picked up @entity44 's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an ideal type or a concept of a ' natural kind '			0
to this day , the method is still used by scientists studying attractiveness and beauty - although computer programmes have replaced much of the original methods used at the turn of the 19th century .			0
