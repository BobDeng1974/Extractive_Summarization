by @entity1 reporter published : 18:11 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 18:12 est , 8 january 2014 weddings have been put on hold in @entity5 after the @entity7 @entity6 halted same - sex marriages while the @entity10 court of appeals rules on whether the couples have the right to wed. the temporary halt on same - sex marriages means many couples who obtained their license but had not yet held their ceremony have been forced to put their plans on hold			1
it is not yet known how many have been affected by the suspension of the law on same - sex marriages , but more than 1,000 couples had taken home marriage licenses in the past two weeks			1
on hold : @entity27 , left , and @entity28 , leave the clerk 's office last month after it canceled a special saturday opening to issue marriage licenses			1
same - sex couples who have marriage licenses are not able to hold their ceremony after a @entity6 ruling today governor @entity36 issued guidance to state agencies instructing them not to recognize same - sex marriages that took place during the two weeks			1
' state recognition of same - sex marital status is on hold until further notice , ' the guidance states			1
' please understand this position is not intended to comment on the legal status of those same - sex marriages - that is for the courts to decide			1
' but mr @entity36 's office also said benefits obtained by the newlyweds during the two weeks should not be revoked			2
for instance , if a couple changed their names on a driver 's license already , that license should not be revoked , mr @entity36 said			2
but , since all the laws revert back to before the federal judge 's december 20 ruling , couples trying to change their name now on a driver 's license will not be allowed to do so , he said			2
@entity5 attorney - general @entity66 issued his own statement , saying the validity of the 1,000 - plus marriages performed is in question , and dependent on the decision of the appeals court			1
one couple who have been forced to put their plans on hold is @entity78 and @entity79 , who collected their license on december 26			2
unlike many couples who solemnized their vows in impromptu ceremonies in the lobby of county clerks offices , mr @entity78 and mr @entity79 decided to wait so mr @entity78 's two children could be involved			2
they had planned to hold their ceremony this weekend , but they waited too long			2
ceremonies have been put on hold while the @entity10 - based 10th @entity7 @entity91 considers the long - term question of whether gay couples have a right to wed in @entity5			1
delay : @entity79 , left , and @entity78 collected a marriage license on december 26 but delayed their ceremony so family could attend			2
now they do n't know if they will be able to go ahead with their plans @entity102 : @entity103 , right and @entity104 pose with their marriage license			0
more than 1,000 were issued in the past two weeks but a court has now halted same - sex marriages the ruling means couples who have not already solemnized the marriage wo n't be considered legally wed , @entity110 clerk @entity109 said			1
a marriage license itself means nothing unless there is a ceremony with an officiator and two witnesses , she said			0
' we were totally devastated			0
the biggest push for us to get married is to show the kids we were in this for the long haul			0
we definitely wanted them to be a part of it , ' mr @entity79 said			0
county clerks have yet to tabulate how many same - sex couples who obtained licenses failed to make their unions official , but @entity133 of the @entity134 estimates a couple of hundred people may fall into this category			1
the uncertainty surrounding the marriages is emblematic of the confusion resonating throughout @entity5 after a two - week rush on same - sex marriages was brought to a sudden halt			1
questions remain about taxes , adoptions and health insurance for the newly married couples			0
' the legal landscape is changing by the minute , ' attorney @entity148 , who represents many same - sex couples , said			1
' we 're trying to figure out exactly what it means in an area where everything is unprecedented			0
' review : the @entity6 has halted same - sex marriages while a court of appeals debates whether they can go ahead in @entity5 governor @entity36 's guidance drew rebukes from attorneys representing three same - sex couples who brought the lawsuit that led to the federal judge 's decision and the @entity167 of @entity5			1
they believe the marriages are valid , and that the couples should be able to get benefits bestowed upon any married couple			1
' regardless of how the state believes the @entity176 will ultimately rule , these couples are legally married and the state should treat them accordingly , ' attorney @entity173 said in a statement			0
mr @entity79 , 32 , said the past three weeks have triggered a roller coaster of emotions for him and other gay and lesbian couples			0
@entity183 was the joy and shock that a federal judge overturned @entity5 's same - sex marriage ban			1
that was followed by the excitement of planning a wedding : renting tuxedos , ordering flowers and having a friend open her house for the event			0
then came the disappointment on monday morning of finding out about the @entity6 ruling and canceling their wedding ceremony in which 50 people were going to attend			0
now , they do n't know when , or if , they 'll ever get married in @entity5			1
' we 're just waiting to see what happens , ' mr @entity79 said			0
phones at the @entity134 have been ringing steadily over the past two days with calls from couples stuck in the same situation as mr @entity79 and mr @entity78 , ms @entity133 said			0
her organization and other gay marriage proponents made sure there were plenty of marriage officials at the county clerk offices in the days after the december 20 ruling			0
ms @entity133 said they were encouraging everyone to finish the process right then and there , in case a court granted the state 's request for a halt			2
but , some people needed or wanted more time , she said			0
many were waiting to hold ceremonies until out - of - town family and friends could make it in			1
the family of one lesbian couple were driving from @entity233 on monday for a ceremony this week			0
' it 's heartbreaking , ' ms @entity133 said			0
' these couples waited and now they just ca n't			0
