by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 05:17 est , 22 may 2013 celebrating your golden wedding anniversary and 50 years of happy marriage is a joyful occasion for any couple			1
more so if you 're sharing that joy with four of your best friends who are raising a glass to exactly the same achievement ... and even more so if you were coincidentally married on the same day and in the same church as the two other couples			2
and a trio of septuagenarians have done just that			0
@entity16 and @entity17 and @entity18 and @entity19 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22 and @entity23 , from @entity24 , @entity21 , were all married at @entity25 in @entity20 on the same day 50 years ago in 1963			1
the couples ( from left @entity17 and @entity28 , @entity19 and @entity29 and @entity22 and @entity23 ) return to @entity25 , @entity20 , where they all married on the same day in 1963 the couples , standing outside @entity25 in @entity20 ( from left , @entity17 and @entity28 , @entity19 and @entity29 and @entity22 and @entity23 ) have all remained the best of friends since their big day in 1963 it was coincidence that all three couples ended up marrying on the same day , but since then they have all remained very close friends			1
mr @entity28 , now 77 , was proud to marry @entity17 , now 76 , when they said their vows at 11am			1
the couple had a four - year courtship beginning with a first date to the ' pictures ' , and now have two sons , @entity44 and @entity45			0
mr @entity28 said : ' when we had been out a few times , i knew it was love			0
she was definitely the girl for me			0
' the couple , who were closely followed down the aisle by @entity28 and mrs @entity23 , believe the key to a healthy marriage is a ' good argument now and again '			2
@entity16 and @entity17 on their wedding day at @entity25 , @entity20 , @entity21 , in 1963 @entity16 and @entity17 outside @entity25 , @entity20 , @entity21 , 50 years after their wedding day mr and mrs @entity23 , who met at a young farmers ' dance in @entity62 , were next to say ' i do ' at 1pm			1
mr @entity64 , now 77 , said : ' it was only 18 months after that when we got married , but i just knew			2
she worked at a sweet confectionery shop making chocolates - i knew they were good			0
' his wife @entity72 , 73 , said : ' @entity22 was a very good dancer , that was the attraction			1
we have of course had our ups and downs but we love each other very much			0
' i do n't believe anyone who says they do n't fall out , but you get over it			2
you have to give and take and you have to stand down even when you think you 're right			0
' the couple have two sons , @entity87 and @entity88 , and three grandchildren			0
@entity87 was so close to the @entity28 's son @entity45 that they were each other 's best man at their own weddings			2
@entity22 and @entity23 outside @entity25 , @entity20 , on their wedding day in 1963 @entity22 and @entity23 cut their wedding cake on their big day in 1963 @entity22 and @entity23 outside @entity25 , @entity20 , where they were married in 1963 and on that day at 2pm , at the tender age of 21 , @entity28 and mrs @entity19 were married			1
the couple , who now have children @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , and two grandchildren , got to know each other when their siblings married , but it was n't love at first sight for both			1
mr @entity29 said : ' the first time we met i had the feeling i liked her but she did n't want to know me			0
if i walked in a room she walked out , but i managed to win her over in the end			0
' unlike the other 71 - year - olds they said they did n't argue much at all			2
mrs @entity19 said : ' my sister married his brother when we were 15			1
we were the last couple to get married , but it was a surprise to hear about the other weddings as we all went to school together			0
' it was a big surprise , we have been really close ever since , and friends for all these years			1
we both agree to have no secrets and not to fall out over money			0
' @entity18 and @entity19 prepare to cut their tiered cake on their wedding day in 1963 @entity18 and @entity19 outside @entity25 , @entity20 , celebrating 50 years since they were married inside the three couples marked their golden wedding anniversaries with family and friends			1
mrs @entity23 added : ' the only problem was we could n't go to each other 's parties because we were celebrating ourselves ! '			1
