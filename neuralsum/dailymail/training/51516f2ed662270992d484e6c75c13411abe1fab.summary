by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 wanted : whistleblower @entity4 has not accepted an offer of asylum from @entity8 , @entity3 said tonight whistleblower @entity4 has not yet formally accepted asylum in @entity8 , @entity3 said today			1
the anti-secrecy group made the announcement on @entity12 this evening after a @entity14 politician tweeted earlier today that the former @entity16 spy agency contractor had accepted political asylum from the @entity19 country			1
' @entity4 has not yet formally accepted asylum in @entity8 , ' @entity3 , whose @entity22 legal researcher @entity21 is assisting @entity4 and travelled to @entity23 with him , later said on @entity12			1
it added : ' the states concerned will make the announcement if and when the appropriate time comes			0
the announcement will then be confirmed by us			0
' unofficial spokesman for the @entity33 @entity32 had prompted the speculation today when he tweeted that the fugitive , believed to be in @entity14 and wanted by the @entity16 authorities for leaking security secrets , had accepted the offer from @entity8			1
the tweet was removed a few minutes after it was posted			0
soon after the tweet 's disappearance he sent another message saying his claim was based on a report from the state all - news television channel @entity48			0
however , no such information could be found on @entity48 's website and no @entity14 news agency reported that @entity48 had ever said it			0
the tv channel could not immediately be reached for comment and the @entity33 declined comment on today 's developments			2
mr @entity4 , who revealed details of a @entity16 intelligence program to monitor internet activity , went to @entity23 's @entity59 on june 23 and was believed to be headed for @entity60			1
but he did not board that flight is believed to have been stranded in the airport 's transit lounge ever since			0
@entity8 president @entity64 had already offered asylum to mr @entity4 while @entity66 and @entity67 said they too would grant asylum to the @entity19 fugitive			1
mr @entity64 said it is perhaps the world 's ' first collective humanitarian asylum ' with various countries saying ' come here ! ' but the @entity16 has cancelled mr @entity4 's passport and it is unclear if he has travel documents he would need to leave @entity23			1
mr @entity64 said mr @entity4 ' will have to decide when he flies here , if he finally wants to travel here			0
' on friday he said : ' as head of state , the government of the @entity84 of @entity8 decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the young @entity16 @entity4 so that he can live ( without ) ... persecution from the empire , ' @entity64 said , referring to the @entity16			1
he made the offer during a speech marking the anniversary of @entity8 's independence			2
it was not immediately clear if there were any conditions to @entity8 's offer			0
' in the name of @entity16 's dignity ... i have decided to offer humanitarian asylum to @entity4 , ' @entity64 proclaimed during a military parade marking the country 's @entity101			1
the escape route is fraught with problems for @entity4 , and would mean him having to gain access to @entity14 and then taking a huge detour ' he is a young man who has told the truth , in the spirit of rebellion , about the @entity16 spying on the whole world , ' @entity64 said			1
but the @entity112 administration said yesterday that @entity16 diplomats are working behind the scenes to make it difficult for @entity4 to find safe harbor in any of the nations that have offered him asylum			1
@entity4 has received a temporary travel document to fly to @entity120 , @entity8 , and both @entity66 and @entity67 have also offered him political asylum , but @entity123 press secretary @entity122 told reporters during his regular briefing that the @entity16 will do what it can to stop him			1
' the @entity16 has been in touch via diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries through which mr. @entity4 might transit or which might serve as final destinations for mr. @entity4 , ' @entity122 said			2
@entity16 diplomats , he added , have ' made very clear that he has been charged with a felony , or with felonies , and , as such , he should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than travel that would result in him returning to the @entity16			1
' an air plane , a supposed @entity138 flight to @entity139 , rolls out in preparation for a take - off seen through a window of @entity59 outside @entity23 , @entity14 it 's not clear whether the @entity112 administration is hoping a @entity145 nation will double - cross @entity4 and offer him up to @entity146 after he arrives from @entity14			1
but the @entity16 , @entity122 said , is still working to persuade @entity23 to short - circuit the process and turn the fugitive over before he can leave @entity23 's @entity59 airport			1
sources say @entity4 will not be allowed to board the only @entity138 plane that offers direct connections to @entity120 , a regular service to @entity60 capital @entity139			0
the routing overflies both the @entity157 and the @entity16 and there are fears the plane will be denied rights to @entity162 airspace , and forced to land , leading to @entity4 's arrest			2
the direct distance from @entity23 to @entity120 is 6,175 miles but it appeared too far for @entity4			2
the escape route for @entity4 is fraught with problems			0
in order for @entity4 to get from @entity23 to the @entity8 capital of @entity120 without facing threat of @entity16 extradition he would need to take an indirect , 7,000 mile route to avoid @entity16 airspace			1
@entity60 is the only country in which @entity4 could land safely in a commercial plane without facing extradition but would have to pass through @entity16 airspace or that of a @entity16 ally whereby it could be forced to land prematurely			2
a private jet is considered the best bet for @entity4 but it is likely to cost in the region of $ 200,000 to charter and would need to be of a certain size in order to reach @entity120 the long way round without refuelling			0
so far , @entity8 has yet to offer to cover the cost of @entity4 â€™s journey , meaning he will have to rely on either a private donor or @entity3 to stump up the money			2
a @entity190 jet would be up to the job but it then becomes a question of how many are available in @entity14 and who would be prepared to face the wrath of @entity16 by loaning one to its most wanted man			0
with @entity14 getting publicly impatient with the @entity16 whistleblower 's presence in its transit zone , his escape route is a logistical nightmare			1
' instead of going west to @entity8 , his obvious option is east to @entity203 and then across the @entity204 to @entity120 , ' said one source			0
it would mean @entity14 allowing him to formally enter its territory , which so far it has refused to do , unwilling to upset the @entity16			0
this would also involve a 14,200 mile detour and a routing that would bring him close to the @entity16 state of @entity212 posing a risk to any private plane willing to take him on a route where there are no scheduled services			0
one option for the fugitive is to charter a private plane			0
former @entity223 analyst @entity222 said : ' a private plane certainly looks like the best bet to me			0
' it has the advantage of simplicity and minimum involvement by the @entity14 government , ' @entity227 reported			0
as @entity222 told @entity233 , @entity4 could avoid @entity16 - influenced airspace by flying north to the @entity235 , through the @entity236 , head soutwhile avoiding @entity239 's @entity238 , until getting to the east of the @entity241 , then squeezing through between islands .			2
