@entity0 said there is no cause for concern among @entity5 fans as he denied @entity6 and @entity7 have priority over bidding for him this summer			1
asked about the @entity13 giants possible interest in signing him @entity0 said : ' as far as i ’m aware there is no clause that suggests a priority for any team			1
' my head now is focused on the @entity21			2
everyone knows there will be media speculation this summer as there always is but i have a contract with @entity5			1
' i just turn the page , ' he added			2
' you know what the speculation is like and you try not to take any notice			1
i know what i want and it is more speculation than reality			1
' presented in @entity6 as the new image of betting company 888poker he admitted there had been tears of rage underneath his @entity5 shirt when he walked off the pitch at @entity59 knowing the league was gone			1
' i had a lot of rage inside me knowing that just a week before we had a great chance to win the league and in that moment it was the realisation that the opportunity had probably gone			2
' i just wanted to hide my face and get down the tunnel			2
we had had such a great season but it was n’t going to be enough			2
the key game was against @entity72			0
maybe we lacked a touch of concentration or focus to stop that goal or create a clear chance after it to get the draw and then depend on ourselves			0
' i do n’t think they would have scored and a draw would have been ok for us			0
but after losing that game we knew that we were no longer relying on ourselves and that was a big blow psychologically to the team			0
needs a bigger trophy cabinet : @entity0 won the @entity85 award ca n't believe it ! the striker was left in tears as @entity5 drew 3 - 3 against @entity89 last week looking ahead positively : @entity0 believes @entity5 can clinch the @entity91 title next season ' it ’s been a great season			1
we did all we could do			0
every player gave absolutely everything			0
we would have taken just being in the top four at the end of the season			0
but then coming so close it was heart - breaking to miss out			0
' when we started the season the aim was to finish in the top four but over the course of the season it became clear that we had a chance to win the league			2
then you have the disappointment of not doing that but if we look back at that original target then we should be really happy			0
' we are back in the @entity113 , which is where @entity5 belongs			1
my season was n’t bad			0
the whole team played really well and we gave the fans something to be proud of			0
' challenge : @entity0 is going head - to - head with @entity7 's @entity121 for @entity122 @entity0 can still win the @entity122 for most league goals in a @entity125 season and said : ' it ’s an honour for me to be fighting for it with the likes of @entity130 , @entity121 and @entity131 who has also had an incredible season			1
' if @entity121 fails to score this weekend the two will finish with the same number of goals and @entity0 would win with a better goals per games ratio			1
asked if @entity5 ’s title chances next season will be improved by their experience in this campaign he said : ' well we were first with just a few weeks left so that will give the younger players great experience going into next season			1
those young players will grow and be even stronger next time			0
