a new shark safety app will help swimmers know when it 's safe to go back in the water			1
the @entity5 app , launched on saturday by the @entity7 government , provides basic information on shark species and how to identify and avoid them across the state			1
tips include keeping out of the water during twilight or darkness , avoiding areas popular with diving seabirds and do n't rely on dolphins to indicate the absence of sharks as they often feed together			0
' there are no 100 per cent guarantees when entering the ocean , ' @entity34 said			0
' but the @entity7 government will continue doing all it can to reduce the risk for swimmers			1
' the launch comes after shocking underwater footage revealed many of the nets which partially cover @entity7 beaches but reportedly ' have huge holes easily big enough for a shark to pass through '			2
twisted , tangled and tattered nets could soon be replaced with a new shark detecting system across @entity7 large holes were discovered in many of the shark nets , which many believe protect them from sharks a @entity54 was found trapped in the nets during a report by @entity56 the state government has promised $ 100,000 to trial shark - detecting sonar technology that will alert lifesavers each time a shark swims close by if the coalition wins the state election			1
the sonar technology will initially undergo a trial at an aquarium , where it will need to be assessed how well the program differentiates between a shark and a dolphin or whale			2
@entity7 goes to the polls in march and when it gets the all clear , it will be rolled out at popular beaches across the state			0
other shark - proof products that have been released , include : shark wristbands , anti-shark wetsuits , shark shields , ankle - worn devices and a variety of sonar technologies			1
the latest band designed to prevent shark attacks on surfers and swimmers , @entity81 uses electromagnetic currents to deter sharks from an area			2
the elude wetsuit ( pictured ) with its unusual design of jagged blue shapes , conceals divers from sharks by exploiting the predator 's colour blindness a new device called @entity96 recently in @entity97 , aiming to make the ocean a safer place for swimmers @entity100 sends electronic pulses from the device , which causes the shark to experience muscle spasms the band , which was launched in @entity97 early this month , is about the size of a watch and has been tested on nearly a dozen species of sharks and aims to ensure humans and sharks can enjoy the ocean together without danger			1
in 2013 , @entity97 scientists developed a pair of anti-shark wetsuits that make divers appear invisible by camouflaging their bodies in the sea			1
the blue pattern of the @entity121 suit aims to trick sharks into thinking surfers are poisonous and the colour ca n't be seen by the sharks because fishes are colour blind			0
while the @entity126 consists of two electrodes that emit a three dimensional electronic field that surrounds the swimmer			0
when a shark swims nearby , the strong electronic pulses and releases from the device , which causes the shark to experience muscle spasms			0
@entity136 was the first to trial the ' @entity139 ' which uses sonar technology to detect shark - shaped objects in coastal areas			1
when detected , the bouys send signal to the lifeguards			0
@entity136 was the first to trial ' @entity139 ' to detect shark - shaped objects and send signal to lifeguards it follows after @entity155 beaches were closed for a record of 10 consecutive days after a shark sighting in 2013 , @entity97 scientists developed a pair of anti-shark wetsuits that make divers appear invisible it follows after a string of repeated shark sightings along the @entity7 coast in recent weeks			1
beachgoers were forced to evacuate following the sighting of a shark along the coastline of @entity7 on january 10 , prompting the closure of all six @entity155 beaches for a record of 10 consecutive days			2
several other sharks , including tiger sharks feeding on dolphins were seen along the coast but authorities have reopened the beaches after jetski patrols found no sign of the sea creatures			0
hundreds of swimmers were forced to dash for the shores at @entity183 and @entity184 beaches on the @entity185 after a shark was spotted in the water last week			0
just recently , a 17 - year - old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark after he went spearfishing off @entity192 beach on the @entity193 of @entity7			2
@entity194 was taken to @entity196 hospital where he is in a stable condition , and later flown to @entity198 for specialist treatment .			0

the @entity7 government has launched a shark safety app called @entity5
the app is designed to help swimmers know when it 's safe to enter
other shark - proof products include : shark wristbands , anti-shark wetsuits , shark shields , ankle - worn devices and a variety of sonar technologies
