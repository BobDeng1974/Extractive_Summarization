comedian @entity0 travelled with her other half on a painting in @entity3 break with flavours there comes a time in a woman ’s life when beach holidays just do n’t cut it any longer , when lying on golden sands serves only to remind you how much weight you forgot to lose again this year and how ill - fitting your swimming costume is			1
being control freaks , most fifty - something females find ‘ doing nothing ’ a bit boring – after all , there are only so many hours one can spend on a @entity20 , and woman can not live by fiction alone			2
this is the time when the ‘ alternative holiday experience ’ tickles your holiday tastebuds and you find yourself looking at brochures for @entity29 cruises			2
excellent ! everyone looks fat pointing at a fjord while wearing an @entity35 jumper			2
but apart from choosing chilly destinations such as the @entity38 or @entity39 , your other non-lolling - about option is the ‘ activity holiday ’ , which can range from @entity41 to kayaking , or painting to pottery			2
yes , i ’ve crossed over : the world is divided into those who still want to ‘ give it large ’ in @entity49 , and those who want to find their ‘ inner artist ’			0
an excursion to @entity53 one day provided inspiration for the budding artists i ’m in the latter camp – and i ’ve got the paintings to prove it			1
over the past year , i have found enormous pleasure , not in shoe shops , but in the haberdashery department of @entity62 , or any shop that supplies art materials			0
i ’ve developed a yearning to be creative			0
i wanted to do something in my spare time that saved my sanity , lowered my blood pressure ( without going to the gym ) , soothed my soul and , with any luck , provided some cheap @entity73 presents			0
cooking has never been my thing , i ’m an enthusiastic but rubbish knitter , but i did do @entity77 , so i decided i fancied being taught how to master watercolours while simultaneously having a holiday somewhere nice			0
bingo ! last autumn i found myself spending a week in @entity81 , just outside @entity53 , with a nine - strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks			1
now before i go any further , i have to warn any single ladies that if you ’re looking for hanky - panky , the @entity89 painting / cooking holiday combo may not provide rich pickings			2
with the exception of the painting tutor , @entity96 , and my other half @entity98 , we were middle - aged women to the core			1
fabulous , hilarious , slightly eccentric middle - aged , middle - class women with plenty of pashminas and photos of dogs on our iphones ! @entity0 stayed at the @entity107 , a comfortable farmhouse surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both @entity81 and @entity53 for seven days , we painters were patiently guided by @entity112 through the basics of sketching , paint technique , colour and form , while the cooks stayed in the kitchen making our meals			1
i know who picked the short straw			0
but then , as they say , it ’s horses for courses			0
the cooks wanted to chop vegetables into smithereens , while we artists wanted to sit in a medieval market town with a paintbrush in one hand and a glass of prosecco in the other			1
of course , it was n’t all work			0
two days into the break , our holiday operator flavours herded us all into minibuses and took us to @entity53			1
like schoolchildren with credit cards , we roamed the most beautiful city in the world and came home , inspired by its mind - boggling loveliness , with lots of photos to copy into our art books back at our base , @entity154			1
staying in @entity81 , just outside @entity53 , @entity0 stayed in a nine - strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks although it was in the middle of nowhere , the farmhouse was comfortable , surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both @entity81 and @entity53			1
the grounds were meticulously kept and the garden featured a very attractive landscaped pool			0
being the only couple , @entity98 and i had a separate annexe to ourselves			1
it might have looked a bit garage - like from the outside , but inside it was large and comfortable and contained a small kitchen ( handy if the cooks in the main house are n’t up to scratch )			0
accommodation in the main villa was simple but stylish , whistle - clean , and with lots of bold splashes of colour and squishy sofas			0
outside , a covered colonnaded area meant we could paint outdoors even when the weather turned			0
in terms of relaxation , the holiday ticked all the right boxes – @entity98 and i had a completely stress - free break , and other people did the cooking			1
how marvellous is that ? there was no need to feel anxious about restaurant bills as the food and drink were entirely inclusive , even when went out on day trips to @entity53 and @entity81			1
as for our artistic endeavours , @entity98 cheated , having been at art school in the 1960s			1
@entity204 backdrop : church of @entity206 at dusk , @entity53 , just one of the @entity210 sights that provided inspiration in the historic city he quickly became the teacher ’s pet , which was slightly infuriating ( although secretly i was rather proud of him )			1
and me ? well , i definitely found my inner artist			0
unfortunately she ’s a bit gaudy and rather heavy - handed on the colour front , but if you like your paintings slightly vulgar , then i ’m happy to take commissions ( prices on application )			0
so , well done to flavours			2
thanks to you , a ratty , tired old couple came home with a some rather special holiday memories			0
now , i ’m not saying that any of mine are going on the wall , but a couple of @entity98 ’s might make it into frames			1
in the meantime , i ’m still doing it			0
my palette , brushes and delicious selection of multi-coloured pans ( the little blocks of paint ) are always to hand			0
i love the ritual of it			0
i like the way my breathing slows down when i have a brush in my hand			2
i might not be very good at painting but painting is very good for me			2
