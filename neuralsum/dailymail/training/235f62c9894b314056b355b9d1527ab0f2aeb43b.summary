by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:44 est , 21 april 2012 updated : 10:53 est , 21 april 2012 on april 15 , two teenage girls calling themselves @entity2 released a music video entitled @entity5			1
within the week , hundreds of thousands of internet users retaliated , many of them calling the video the stupidest thing on the web			1
@entity12 dubbed @entity5 as ‘ the worst song of 2012 – if not of all time ’ and @entity14 described it as ‘ the video that destroyed my faith in humanity			1
’ scroll down for music video ' we 're hot ! ' : pop duo @entity2 in their music video hot problems in which they lament the downsides to being pretty backlash : the video has garnered more than 100,000 ' dislikes ' on @entity28 and a paltry 8,600 ' likes ' as of saturday morning internet watcher @entity29 jumped on the hyperbolic bandwagon , saying : ‘ the worst song ever is pretty d * mn terrible			1
’ however , @entity35 tech blogger @entity34 has a very different view on the video , which was performed by @entity38 and @entity39			1
she questions why , in the age when bullying is being put in the spotlight , it is so in favour to lambast teenage girls for doing something fairly harmless			2
while ms @entity34 does n’t praise the girls ’ musical talents ( or lack thereof ) , she does say that the video is typical behaviour from teenage girls			1
ms @entity52 told @entity53 that she and ms @entity39 meant no harm , saying : ‘ it was all just for fun and to just have something we could share with our friends			1
' downsides to being pretty ' : @entity2 have split opinion as journalist @entity60 , pictured , did when she wrote how women hated her because of her ' lovely looks ' ‘ we enjoy writing funny lyrics and songs and we decided that we really liked this one			0
’ ms @entity39 added : ‘ we knew we could n’t really sing			0
’ there are more than 54,000 comments and counting on @entity28 – many of them complaining over the mediocrity of the song and of its performers			1
read a short selection of comments below			0
last year , @entity74 received waves of backlash for her now - notorious video celebrating the last work day of the week , friday			2
the two wannabe pop princesses have also been propelled into a storm of @entity60 proportions			0
in the video , @entity38 and @entity39 gesture flirtatiously in the back of a limousine while recounting all the obstacles they encounter with men and other girls because of their looks			2
lamenting ( out of tune ) over a rather dodgy electro - pop backing track , they proclaim : ' hot girls we have problems , too			0
we 're just like you , except we 're hot			0
' other lines include : ' please do n't get me wrong			0
i know i 'm hot , but textbook perfection really takes a lot			0
' @entity104 guys calls my phone and girls call names ... but i ca n't be tamed			0
' the song is at serious risk of splitting opinion as ferociously as mrs @entity60 did when she claimed in a @entity112 article earlier this month that women loathed her for being too attractive			0
she said : ' there are downsides to being pretty — the main one being that other women hate me for no other reason than my lovely looks			0
' last year 's meme : @entity2 's video attracked derogatory comparisons to @entity74 's friday which was heavily slammed last year her initial story attracted 1.6million hits - and thousands of vitriolic insults - on @entity127 , rising to 2.7million when including her follow - up article defending her stance			1
in a similar brewing storm , the ' @entity5 ' video has been watched more than a million times on @entity28 , but has received more than 100,000 ' dislikes ' compared to just 8,600 ' likes '			1
one poster pleaded : ' please shoot my ears off			0
' as if anticipating the resultant backlash , the production company , @entity139 , made sure to distance itself from the video			2
' @entity139 did not create any of the audio or lyrics for this video , ' it stated in the description			2
' we produced the video as a favor			2
' from an ' artistic ' point of view , many are also making derogatory comparisons to @entity74 's widely slated flop friday which was dubbed possibly the ' worst video of all time ' last year			1
it is not entirely clear whether the high school pair are merely being tongue in cheek , but they have said they created the video ' just for fun ' .			1

@entity165 ' video gets two million @entity28 hits
now has 100,000 ' dislikes ' and only 8,600 ' likes '
commentators blasting it as worst video on the internet
teens said they only did it ' for fun '
