playing for managers like @entity2 and @entity3 has geared him up for the next phase of his career			2
' everyone that you work with throughout you career , whether it be the right thing or the wrong thing , you learn , ' said an emotional @entity0			1
' if you are not stupid with it , open your eyes and take from it what you need and what you do n't then you will make your own recipe for success			0
' you are always learning and i always learn more in the difficult moments – that is when you find out about yourself			0

' everyone knows how much i love the club , my feelings about them			0
it is a wish right now , i only announced i was leaving @entity21 on monday so i am not trying to get out of it but it has only been a day			1

@entity0 spreads his arms wide and celebrates to the @entity13 fans after scoring against @entity98 the former @entity13 captain celebrates after scoring against @entity100 and could be set for a third stint ' there is nothing better than trying to help a team - mate mentally and make them a better player and it those moments which i will cherish			1

with @entity7 newspaper @entity126 launching a campaign to get national manager @entity128 to hand the 37 year - old a final farewell for @entity130 against @entity131 in march , it promises to be a very long , drawn out goodbye			1

but he admitted : ' i did n't want to be the focus to be on me			2
it was tough personally for me but i embraced the @entity9 and @entity21			2
it 's not easy , if players come here at a late stage in their career and they are not ready to perform , it is not like that			2
' the decision was pretty easy for me			0
people were asking me about retirement and i do n't know about that yet but i knew it was time to leave @entity21			0

when get upset it is for the good of the team			0
i always try my best			0
' i will miss being in the dressing room			0
people see my competitive side but i like to joke too			0
i will keep my place here , watch some games , provided they will let me come back ! ' @entity0 during his final game for @entity8 i am taking this opportunity to announce that unfortunately saturday was my last game for the @entity8			1
the decision has always been that i would leave after the duration of my contract and although that was never going to change , i did n't want it to distract from the progress of the team			0
i have immensely enjoyed my four - and - a - half years here and would like to thank everyone involved with this club who has made my time here so enjoyable			2
