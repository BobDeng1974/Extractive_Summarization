by @entity0 published : 14:04 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 03:37 est , 6 january 2014 the controversial badger cull cost an astonishing £ 4,100 per badger , it was claimed last night			2
it is estimated that the cull , which ended with just over half of the planned 5,000 badgers being killed , cost £ 7.3million in total			2
the taxpayer would have picked up the bulk of this – some £ 5.8million			0
picking up the bill : it is estimated that the cull cost £ 7.3million in total the calculations come from animal charity care for the @entity19 which described the cull as ‘ one of the most disastrous and expensive in history ’			1
the badger cull , which began last autumn , aimed to help control the spread of @entity25 among cattle by killing at least 70 per cent of the badgers in pilot zones in west @entity29 and @entity30			1
but both ended without hitting their targets – despite the initial figures being revised down and the culling periods extended			0
critics described the project as a fiasco but ministers insisted it has been worthwhile			0
the badger cull aimed to help control the spread of @entity25 among cattle by killing at least 70 per cent of the badgers in pilot zones care of the @entity19 pieced together the cull ’s cost from answers to parliamentary questions , statistics from the @entity50 and @entity51 and @entity53 requests			1
this put the total cost for at £ 7.3million – or £ 4,121 for each of the 1,771 dead badgers			0
this included £ 2.66million for policing the culls , which attracted protestors , and included the cost of overtime , helicopters and four - wheel - drive vehicles			0
another £ 3.2million is estimated to have been spent by @entity65 and other government departments on projects including pinpointing the location of badger setts and monitoring the cull ’s @entity70 , who paid for the marksmen , were billed an estimated £ 1.49million			2
care for the @entity19 has also calculated that if the culls are run annually for four years , as planned , the total bill will come to £ 19million			0
however , even if the cull did lead to a drop in @entity25 among cattle , the taxpayer ’s bill , including compensation for cattle that have to be destroyed , would only fall by £ 2.5million			1
@entity84 , the charity ’s policy advisor , said : ‘ taxpayers will not benefit from badgers being killed , the badgers certainly wo n’t benefit – and neither will the farmers because culling was always going to be a costly failure			1
‘ it ’s time the government realised that			0
