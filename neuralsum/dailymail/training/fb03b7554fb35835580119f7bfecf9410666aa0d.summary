lawyers for abuse survivor @entity8 have complained to home secretary @entity9 over messages from a panel member - including an email sent two days before they were due to meet			1
they claim @entity13 threatened him after a social media row between another abuse victim and the panel member ’s son , who tried to confront critics against his father ’s place on the inquiry			1
holding a paedophile inquiry : home secretary @entity9 ( pictured ) has received a complaint from the lawyer of an abuse survivor over messages from a member of her panel into child sex abuse claims mr @entity8 's lawyer @entity31 told the @entity32 that the ' private communications with our client , a man who is deeply traumatised by his experience of abuse , certainly seem ill - advised to us '			1
meanwhile former child protection manager @entity38 has complained about an apparently inappropriate email from panellist @entity40 - about whom he has previously raised questions			1
last week , the @entity42 reported how 23 victims of alleged historical child abuse had told mrs may , 58 , they were withdrawing support from the government ’s inquiry , claiming it was ‘ not fit for purpose ’			2
mrs may set up the inquiry into historical child abuse in the summer amid incendiary claims there was an @entity57 cover - up of a murderous paedophile ring around @entity59 in the 1980s			2
gone : mrs may has struggled to put in place a chairman retaining the confidence of victim groups			0

the latest developments will trouble mrs may			0
a source close to the inquiry told the @entity32 that the emails should not have been sent , leaving the panel members ’ fates in doubt			0
a crunch meeting on friday between mrs may and some of the largest groups for child sex abuse victims was told that the allegations against panel members were being probed by an unnamed @entity83			2
mr @entity8 - who has previously spoken of abuse at a @entity86 boarding school - was first in contact with mr @entity13 in summer last year , claimed to have received ‘ unsolicited communications ’ from the panel member after speaking out about the inquiry			1
complaint : lawyers for abuse survivor @entity8 have contacted home secretary @entity9 over messages from panel member @entity13 ( pictured ) - including an email sent two days before a meeting the abuse survivor was most concerned about an email sent by mr @entity13 ahead of a meeting last month , which said he was ‘ looking forward to meeting ’ him and had been studying his tweets			1
the message said : ‘ the insults you have issued about me , i have no problem with - you are entitled to your opinion			0
however , what has been said about my son , @entity107 , is a different matter			0
’ mr @entity8 's team said that after the email , he ' did not feel comfortable about attending the meeting '			1
but mr @entity13 has denied that he intended the email to be threatening , according to the @entity32			2
mr @entity38 said he was worried that ms @entity40 used to work at the @entity113 , where a @entity115 member had a job as a consultant in the early 1970s			1
he also has concerns about her alleged connections with social work managers from @entity122 in north @entity123 , where there is known to have been sexual abuse in children ’s homes			0
@entity64 said in october that she had no choice but to quit as chairman of the inquiry after accepting the victims had lost all confidence in her ability to conduct the investigation impartially			0
it followed sustained pressure over her links with the former home secretary , @entity138 , who is facing claims that he failed to act on a dossier of paedophile allegations in the 1980s			1
her departure was a huge blow after the previous chairman , @entity65 , also had to quit because her late brother , sir @entity145 , was attorney general during the same period			0
mrs @entity64 's links to @entity138 came under scrutiny because he is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry about his handling of child abuse allegations .			1
