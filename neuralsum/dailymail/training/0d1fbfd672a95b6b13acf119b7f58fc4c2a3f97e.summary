by @entity0 from @entity2 in flamboyant cerise and gold skirts to @entity8 's @entity7 people in their crimson cloaks and beaded collars , the world has no shortage of natty dressers			1
one woman who knows exactly where to find them is @entity16 , a @entity18 photographer turned traveller who in 2012 , scoured the world for stylish citizens			1
now @entity16 is back with a new and updated version of her book see @entity25 which includes the results of a perambulation around @entity28 and a trip to @entity31 's holy city , @entity32			1
beautiful : @entity32 , on the banks of the @entity36 , is one of @entity31 's holiest cities but that does n't mean its residents ca n't dress - these women look beautiful and as these incredible photos reveal , there 's no shortage of style , whether in the snowy @entity46 wilderness or in the remote @entity8 bush			1
' my favourite thing as a fashion and travel photographer is to go a little farther up the mountain , a little farther down that bumpy dirt road , to show the ways people in remote places work and play and live , ' writes @entity16 in the introduction			2
' i eagerly trekked neverending miles and timeless hours , from @entity58 , @entity59 to @entity60 , @entity28 to @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , @entity64			0
' between fashion shoots for @entity18 , @entity66 and other magazines , i was lucky enough to glimpse the beauty of indigenous cultures – their immensely differing , but each in its own way traditional , iconographies , architectural modes , and styles of dressing			1
' meeting people with such wildly dissimilar references and exploring new socio - cultural terrain is the source and inspiration of my life			0
to be able to share that with the world is an incredible gift			0
' stylish : these @entity7 women ( left ) have accessorised their floral tea dresses with collars , while women from @entity2 's @entity90 take a brighter approach mountains : a woman shows off her multi-coloured feather earrings and hand - woven blanket coat as she looks out over the @entity97 range in @entity2 striking : a model keeps warm during a @entity100 @entity18 shoot in freezing @entity46 ( left ) and right , a group of gypsy girls photographed in their camp just outside @entity104 highlights include a stunning photo of @entity59 's ' @entity107 ' with wings created by the cow - hide shield attached to them by ranchers and a striking shot of a @entity114 girl , pretty in a grass skirt and bright garland of flowers			1
other stars include a pair of @entity8 women who combine their demure floral dresses with colourful turbans and the @entity123 dressed in glamorous pale fur and leather ensembles			2
' @entity127 is where you find it , provided you are receptive to its ever - presence in everyday life , ' adds designer @entity133 in the foreword			0
' i have travelled the globe with @entity16 and feel that she captures the true essence of beauty in her imagery , far from mainstream media , from the deserts of @entity142 to the waters of the @entity36 ! ' proof , were any still required , that fashion truly is a global medium whether you 're swathed in fur in @entity46 or patrolling the steppes in beads			0

wrapping up warm : the designer clothes worn by @entity100 @entity18 's model ( second left ) have nothing on the glamorous pieces worn by the @entity46 @entity123 lovely : the bright skirts of the @entity156 who live on a lake between @entity2 and @entity142 made the cover ( left ) and right , a group of women in the @entity163 's @entity162			2
