a vast tract of the @entity1 , from @entity2 to @entity3 is in danger of being without power for up to two years , if a massive solar flare knocks out the power grid			1
with the @entity9 pushing out unusually large solar flares , capable of disrupting power supplies , a device is being proposed that would prevent more than 300 million @entity13 being left without power			1
@entity15 @entity14 have proposed legislation to push the government to provide surge protectors and grid - saving devices that would offer protection in case of a massive electromagnetic pulse from either a flare or nuclear weapon			1
electromagnetic pulses , also known as @entity26 , are massive surges of energy that can come from a severe solar flare , such as this one pictured on may 12 , or from a high altitude nuclear explosion ' this is serious stuff , ' the head of the @entity32 , @entity33 , said			2
the former @entity36 official cited a @entity38 report that claimed a region from @entity2 to @entity3 could be left without electricity for up to two years after a solar flare			1
there are also heightened fears from defense officials that terrorists could set off a small nuclear bomb overhead			0
about 300 electric transformers in the @entity48 which control the grid , need to be protected , according to the @entity50			1
a study into solar storms last year predicted there was a one in eight chance of a major one affecting @entity55 by 2020			0
the effects of a solar flare could disrupt ' transportation , communication , banking and finance systems , and government services ; the breakdown of the distribution of potable water owing to pump failure , and the loss of perishable foods and medications because of lack of refrigeration , ' the @entity63 said			0
one of the largest solar flares to be recorded this year happened on may 12			0
although the @entity9 sent billions of tons of solar particles into space , capable of knocking out power and communication devices , they were not traveling in @entity55 's direction			1
an increase in solar flare activity has been observed in the past 12 months , as the @entity9 reaches the peak of its 11 - year cycle			0
however , the proposed grid devices would offer some protection			2
' you are basically talking about surge protectors , of a somewhat exotic kind , but it is a means of interrupting the pulse , ' mr @entity33 said			2
damaging : the solar flare in may was not headed in @entity55 's direction , but scientists predict one is likely to hit the @entity95 from @entity96 has bipartisan support			0
' it is critical that we protect our major transformers from cascading destruction			0
the @entity106 encourages industry to develop standards necessary to protect our electric infrastructure against both natural and man - made @entity111 events , ' @entity102 , the @entity103 @entity14 who is offering the bipartisan bill , said			0
the legislation includes information from a recent electromagnetic pulse commission report that stated : ' @entity48 society is not structured , nor does it have the means , to provide for the needs of nearly 300 million @entity13 without electricity			1

region from @entity2 to @entity3 could be without power for two years
grid protectors needed to prevent mass *blackout* for 300 million people
