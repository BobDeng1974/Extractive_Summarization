hospitals are paying up to £ 3,200 a shift to hire locum doctors in @entity3			1
short - staffed trusts are forced to pay exorbitant amounts as they compete to attract agency medics			1
full - time doctors say it is ‘ demoralising ’ working alongside locums earning three or four times as much			2
@entity11 , which runs @entity12 , pictured , paid £ 3,258 for a consultant to work a 24 - hour shift in @entity3 between @entity15 and @entity16 figures obtained by @entity18 show that @entity11 paid £ 3,258 for a consultant to work a 24 - hour shift in @entity3 between @entity15 and @entity16			1
not all the money went to the doctor as the agency employing them will have taken a sizeable cut			0
nonetheless , it is still a considerable amount bearing in mind the locum will have spent much of the shift asleep but ‘ on - call ’ – where they need to attend only in an emergency			2
@entity34 in @entity35 paid £ 2,099 for a doctor to work a nine - hour shift in @entity3 over the same period – equivalent to £ 230 an hour			1
three more trusts – the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 – each paid around £ 1,800 for an @entity3 nurse to work 12 hours			1
the figures , obtained under the @entity45 , show that at one trust , @entity46 in @entity35 , more than 70 per cent of all doctors ’ shifts between @entity15 and @entity16 were filled by locums			2
as they are generally less experienced and competent than full - time doctors employed by the trust , there is concern that such over-reliance could put patients at risk			2
the @entity39 in @entity40 , pictured , @entity41 and @entity42 each paid around £ 1,800 for an @entity3 nurse to work 12 hours at the @entity63 @entity62 trust , 58 per cent of shifts between @entity15 and @entity16 were filled by locums , while at the @entity66 it was 52 per cent			1
the @entity62 is short of @entity3 doctors partly because staffing levels have not kept pace with the rising number of patients , so trusts have to pay vast amounts to agencies			1
dr @entity75 , president of the @entity76 , said : ‘ market forces really are quite extreme currently , with the lack of permanent people to employ			0
‘ it means hospitals are desperate to try to find people to fill these slots and are having to pay super premium rates			0
it can be very demoralising to be working alongside somebody with much less experience , much more junior , who is earning a multiple income compared to you			0
’ last month a scathing report by the @entity92 warned that doctors and nurses were quitting to become locums because the pay rates were three or four times higher			0
it also highlighted how spending on agency staff had soared by a quarter in the past year to £ 2.6billion dr @entity100 , chairman of the @entity102 ’s council , which represents doctors , said : ‘ locums play a vital role in the @entity62 but they should not be used as a long - term solution			1
greater reliance on locums is a sign of stress on the system and the result of poor workforce planning by government			0
’ the @entity115 said : ‘ since may 2010 we have more than 9,500 extra doctors and nearly 8,500 extra nurses			0
we want to reduce reliance on agency staff and soon hospitals that do n’t have their finances in order will have to make significant progress towards halving their agency spend or risk tough consequences			0
