brain boost : evidence linking a cuppa with a reduction in cognitive decline it 's the national drink that millions of us turn to when we need a pick - me - up			1
but tea does far more than just help to wake us up			1
scientists say the traditional cuppa can keep the mind sharp into old age			1
and the benefits of drinking as little as one to three cups a day in staving off mental decline are especially pronounced among women			2
in one study , of almost 1,500 men and women in @entity21 , drinking more than four cups a day cut the odds of memory failing by three - quarters			2
even just one to three cups of @entity26 tea a day had an effect , cutting the odds of cognitive decline by 43 per cent			2
it is thought compounds in tea may protect against the poisons that ravage the brain in @entity35 ’s			1
possibilities include theanine , a plant chemical found only in tea and in mushrooms			1

@entity90 of the @entity91 said : ‘ there is building evidence linking a cuppa and a reduction in cognitive decline			0
‘ however , we are a long way from being able to say for sure a regular brew will reduce your risk of developing dementia			0
‘ the best way to reduce your risk is to eat a balanced diet , exercise regularly and not smoke			0

analysis of six different studies found drinking tea helped the brain to stay sharper
