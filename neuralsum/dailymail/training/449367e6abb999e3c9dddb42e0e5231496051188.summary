by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:05 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 30 january 2013 @entity4 first minister @entity3 's chosen question for the referendum on independence has been rejected by the @entity7 for being worded to encourage people to vote @entity9 the elections watchdog today threw out an attempt by @entity3 to skew the question in the scottish independence referendum to coax people into voting @entity9			1
the @entity14 wanted to ask voters : ' do you agree that @entity4 should be an independent country ? yes / no. ' but the @entity17 has demanded ' more neutral wording ' and insisted voters have a clearer idea about what severing ties with the rest of the @entity23 will mean for @entity4			1
it also recommended the main @entity9 and no campaigns be allowed to spend up to £ 1.5million each in the run up to the big vote			1
the rejection of mr @entity3 's question comes after a poll showed support his dream of going it alone is now at its lowest level since the @entity34 was created in 1999			1
just 23 per cent of people want @entity4 to leave the @entity23 , the annual @entity37 survey for 2012 revealed			0
it showed a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported independence			0
almost 60 per cent of those surveyed now say they are ‘ quite ’ or ‘ very ’ worried about independence , up from 46 per cent in 2011			0
mr @entity3 has secured a deal with @entity45 to stage a referendum on independence in autumn 2014			2
plain language experts were consulted about mr @entity3 's proposed question , and in surveys it was repeatedly found to be designed to encourage people to back independence in focus groups voters said mr @entity3 's wording ' implies that @entity4 being independent is a " good thing " because voters are being invited to agree with this view ' and suggested independence was ' inevitable ' and voters were being asked to ' rubber - stamp ' it			1
deputy first minister @entity64 used @entity65 to announce the @entity4 government would accept the recommendations the @entity4 government wanted to ask : ' do you agree that @entity4 should be an independent country ? yes / no. ' but the @entity7 said it was a leading question and proposed : ' should @entity4 be an independent country ? yes / no. ' the recommendation has been accepted			1
one person said : ' you ’re free to say no , but it goes against the grain with that word [ agree ] , you do n’t feel comfortable putting no. ' the @entity7 has now drawn up an alternative : ' should @entity4 be an independent country ? yes / no. ' deputy first minister @entity64 wrote on @entity65 this morning : ' i can confirm that the @entity14 will accept all of the @entity7 's # indyref recommendations			1
' @entity79 , electoral commissioner for @entity4 said : ' voters are entitled to a referendum which produces a result they can have confidence in			0
' we have rigorously tested the proposed question , speaking to a wide range of people across @entity4			0
any referendum question must be , and be seen to be , neutral			0
people told us that they felt the words " do you agree " could lead voters towards voting @entity9			0
' mr @entity3 last year struck a deal with @entity45 to hold a referendum on independence in autumn 2014 research by the watchdog also found that voters want factual information ahead of the referendum			2
' although we would not expect the terms of independence to be agreed before the vote , clarity about how the terms of independence will be decided would help voters understand how the competing claims made by campaigners before the referendum will be resolve , ' the @entity7 added			2
the @entity23 and @entity4 governments should agree a ' joint position ' on how independence would be negotiated before the referendum			2
mr @entity79 added : ' people had a clear understanding that ‘ independent country ’ meant being separate from the @entity23			2
' but they did want factual information in advance about what will happen after the referendum			0
we ’re asking the @entity23 and @entity14 to provide that clarity and we ’ll then make sure it gets to voters as part of our public awareness campaign			0
' better off in : the @entity37 survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want @entity4 to be independent , the lowest level since the @entity34 was established in 1999 the @entity7 also set out details of how much the two sides should spend in the run up to the referendum			1
the two lead campaigns fighting funds would be capped at £ 1.5million each			1
among parties in the @entity34 , the pro-independence @entity132 would be allowed £ 1.34million , while opponents would be capped at £ 84,000 for @entity135 , £ 396,000 for @entity4 conservatives and £ 201,000 for @entity137 and £ 150,000			1
the @entity138 could spend £ 150,000 .			0

@entity3 wanted to ask : ' do you agree that @entity4 should be an independent country ? yes / no. '
but @entity7 says @entity4 government 's question is leading and left some voters thinking independence was ' inevitable '
lead campaigns to be allowed £ 1.5million fighting funds
