@entity0 looks set to remain in charge of @entity2 this week , despite the club holding talks with @entity5			1
@entity7 officials , led by managing director @entity8 and chief scout @entity9 , spoke with @entity5 in @entity10 over the weekend			0
however , @entity11 understands he is not the only candidate for the head coach vacancy at @entity15			0
@entity0 has been caretaker manager of @entity2 since the departure of @entity17 former @entity18 coach @entity5 is the favourite to take over as head coach of @entity2 and there is a suggestion that former @entity23 midfielder @entity5 , who stepped down as boss of @entity18 at the end of last season to take a sabbatical , would prefer to wait until the summer before taking up the role			1
that is also the case with @entity32 compatriot @entity31 , who insists he will not walk out on @entity33 in the middle of the season , especially not with his side having climbed to third in @entity36 at the weekend			0
it means that @entity0 will almost certainly be in the dugout when @entity39 visit @entity40 on saturday			2
@entity17 steered @entity41 to a 2 - 1 win over @entity43 in his first @entity45 game on saturday he would be willing to take the reins until the end of the season and would like to remain at the club whatever direction the hierarchy take with their appointment			1
@entity5 's situation , meanwhile , is complicated slightly by some of his preferred backroom team still being under contract at @entity18 .			0
