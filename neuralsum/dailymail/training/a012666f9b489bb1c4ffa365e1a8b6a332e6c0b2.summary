after a summer of discontent that saw hundreds of rioters roam the streets of the capital , the @entity0 needed to take action			1
and it appears that this imposing 10foot high steel structure is their answer to the problem			2
the police cordon was erected at the north end of @entity14 near @entity15 yesterday afternoon in an attempt to stop anti-cuts protesters heading towards @entity18			1
officers were also called in to help out paramedics after thousands of @entity22 workers went on strike			1
imposing : the steel cordon stretches across the road in central @entity26 today as police unveil their latest tactic in the bid to stop disorder on the streets sealed off : the barrier was erected at the north end of @entity14			1
it is used by police when they think a public order situation is developing to block people and cars on the lookout : police officers look through the windows of the cordon that has been erected just yards from @entity15 and @entity43 to stop protesters heading towards @entity18 officials said 42 per cent of @entity47 workers walked out on strike - and the service received 30 per cent more calls than normal			1
the reason for the surge is unclear			2
police did not deal with ' critical incidents ' where lives were at risk - but provided medical support where they could help out			1
the @entity0 said the barrier of steel structure is put in place when a potential public order situation is likely to develop and they need a physical barrier to block cars and people			2
yesterday officers stood behind the cordon using windows to lookout for troublemakers who had used today 's public sector strikes as an excuse to protest			2
the barrier was used after a group of protestors stormed @entity75 in @entity76 , with some making it on to the roof and setting off flares			2
the group from @entity81 - the anti-capitalist protesters camped out in the churchyard of @entity84 - said they were ' targeting ' @entity85 , the ceo of mining company @entity86			0

' but were stopped before the building could be occupied			0
an @entity81 spokesman said they were aiming the demonstration at mr @entity85 because he was the highest paid ceo of all the @entity95 companies in the last year			0
some protesters close to @entity75 lit flares during the protest , such as this man who walks down the centre of @entity101 in central @entity26 heavy presence : a large number of police officers formed a cordon outside the offices of mining company @entity86 he said that around 20 protesters were being held inside by riot police and that a ' few hundred ' were being kettled in the street outside - a number of them were holding @entity114 placards			1
@entity115 , supporter of @entity81 , said : ' @entity85 is a prime example of the greedy 1 per cent lining their own pockets while denying workers ' pensions			1
' an @entity86 spokeswoman said : ' @entity86 confirms that a number of protesters have attempted to enter the company 's offices in central @entity26 today			1
' all executive pay is approved by the company 's shareholders and is linked to company and individual performance			0

one bystander said police started arresting people after two protesters attacked a @entity149			1
a small number of protesters from @entity114 targeted an office block in @entity26 's @entity101 , gaining access to the roof police made several arrests after the building was stormed by around 20 protesters protest sign : the demonstrators displayed this banner from the roof the building but it was quickly removed by police officers who had stormed the building ' it was carnage , ' he added			1
' it all kicked off when two people attacked a @entity149			0
' then the police detained people			1
i think they were just worried about it escalating because they were very pleasant with the way they dealt with people			0
' there had been rumours that there was going to be a couple of thousand protesters coming down here which i think is why there were so many police stationed here			1
' eventually they packed the protesters on a coach and took them away			0
' witnesses said the police had maintained a distance from the protest until they began blocking the road , when officers intervened			1
@entity194 , who runs a dry cleaners across the road , said : ' the protest started out peacefully and there were women and children there			0
' at one point they were blocking the road so the police moved them back			1
going in : police rush the building used by mining company @entity86 , after protestors from @entity81 entered the building apprehended : a group of police officers search a man near @entity15 while another close to the famous landmark makes his feelings known ' then there were people turning up who looked like they did n't belong there			2
they were covering up their faces and looked like they wanted trouble			0
' something must have happened because the police contained them at the side of the road and just started arresting people			2
' if they had moved along it would n't have happened but i saw one woman pushing police officers			2
any excuse to have a go			0
' @entity235 , who runs to the @entity237 cafe , in @entity136 , said the police jumped on a group of protesters who had begun pushing and shoving			2
