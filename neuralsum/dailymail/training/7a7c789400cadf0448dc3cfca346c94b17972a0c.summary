the omens are good that 2012 will be an excellent year , a leading druid said today , after the sun shone on @entity3 during a dawn ceremony to mark the winter solstice			1
organisers of next year 's @entity7 could perhaps take heart from the positive pronouncement by @entity10 , the arch druid of the standing stones in @entity13 , after this morning 's ceremony			1
he said that the sun rising over the horizon at the end of the ceremony , bathing more than 1,000 people who attended in pale light , meant good things for the next 12 months			1
good year ahead : the sun shone on @entity3 in @entity13 during a dawn ceremony to mark the winter solstice this morning , a positive omen for the next 12 months gathering : arch druid @entity10 ( centre ) leads the annual ritual , attended by more than 1,000 people the mild temperatures and morning light at the pre-historic site were in marked contrast to last year 's solstice , when the stones were surrounded by a thick blanket of snow and the mist obscured the actual sunrise			1
mr @entity10 said : ' just as the ceremony came to an end the sun came over the horizon , it was excellent			1
' it has been a very jolly occasion			2
it 's a good omen for the year ahead			1
' @entity45 : structures are piled high in preparation for the grand finale of @entity49 in @entity50 up in flames : the blaze symbolises the passing of the old year and the imminent arrival of the new in @entity50 @entity50 fireworks : as the festival ends , the spectators look forward to days getting longer again during the winter solstice , the sun is closer to the horizon than at any other time in the year , meaning shorter days and longer nights			1
the day after the winter solstice marks the beginning of lengthening days , leading up to the summer solstice in june			1
although the solstice usually falls on december 21 , fluctuations in the modern calendar - which does not correspond exactly to the solar year of 365.2422 days - mean the pagan community were marking the first day of this winter today			1
roosting : a flock of starlings sees in the summer solstice on the @entity73 in @entity50 last night spectators : people on @entity50 beach watch the astonishing movement of the starlings midwinter : the birds in @entity50 were performing just a few hours before the sun was at its furthest from the @entity83 the day after the winter solstice marks the beginning of lengthening days , leading up to the summer solstice the solstice was celebrated a day later than usual because of fluctuations in the modern calendar of 365 days a year which does not correspond exactly to the solar year of 365.2422 days upholding centuries of tradition : a woman dances ( left ) while @entity94 poses for a photograph ( right ) the odds of this @entity97 being the warmest on record have been slashed by bookies			1
@entity100 has also had to suspend all betting on snow markets as punters are set to scoop up to Â£ 20,000 following a series of shrewd bets during the earlier cold snap that there would be no snow in the @entity109 on christmas day			1
it 's now just 2/1 ( from 20/1 ) that we will have the warmest @entity97 ever recorded in @entity112 , while north of the border the odds are 3/1 ( from 20/1 ) warm - weather madness could also spread to the @entity116 as the the bookies offer 100/1 that any member is spotted in flip - flops during their stay at @entity121			2
it 's 500/1 @entity97 shoppers panic - buying suncream cause supermarkets to sell out and just even money that a national newspaper carries a picture ( taken on @entity97 ) of a child eating an ice cream or building a sandcastle on a beach			2
@entity132 of @entity100 said : ' this mild weather gamble has got us sweating just as much as the rising temperatures			2
punters are now banking on the mercury continuing to rise for a bumper @entity97 pay - day			1

temperatures could reach as high as @entity155 ( @entity156 ) on christmas day , not far short of @entity109 's december 25 record of @entity158 ( 60f ) , set in 1896 at @entity159 in @entity160			2
but the mildness will be accompanied by rain that could be heavy in parts of western @entity164			0
following two snowy , very cold @entity166 , the festive season started today with temperatures as high as @entity168 ( 54f )			0
the thermometer is set to reach similar heights tomorrow in @entity112 and @entity171 which will be cloudy with rain moving south , but it will be cooler and showery in @entity164 and @entity172			0
rain will continue in northern parts of @entity109 on @entity174 , with generally fine weather in @entity112 and @entity171			0
the high of @entity177 is likely to be reached in @entity164 , but @entity164 and people in @entity172 will also have to contend with wet and windy conditions , with gusts of up to 60mph			0
it will stay generally cloudy , with some drizzle , in @entity112 and @entity171 on december 25 with temperatures reaching @entity184			0
there will be similar temperatures on @entity187 which will see @entity164 and @entity172 having more rain , while in @entity112 and @entity171 it will be dry , but cloudy			0
@entity190 , a forecaster for @entity191 @entity109 , said : ' this is likely to be one of the warmer christmases			0
it 's certainly going to be very mild , although there 's going to be quite a lot of rain in places			0
' @entity200 : sunrise at the winter solstice today			0
here commuters walk across @entity204 , with @entity205 in the background , as the sun emerges @entity200 : the sunrises over the @entity209 today			0
the @entity210 can be seen on the right @entity212 : people gather at @entity214 to watch the sun set on the winter solstice @entity217 : the view looking towards the @entity219 this morning as seen from @entity221 bay , @entity222 welcoming the light : the winter solstice marks the turn of the year , when days begin to lengthen again drum roll for winter : but of a more pressing concern is what the weather will be like for @entity97 , and forecasters say it will be mild and damp burning the @entity232 : this celebration takes place annually in the streets of @entity50 lanterns : the celebration sees people burn structures made of wood and paper whirl : burning the @entity232 involves a huge street party , involving dancers and other performers community : hundreds of @entity50 residents are involved with the festival , which has run since 1993			0
