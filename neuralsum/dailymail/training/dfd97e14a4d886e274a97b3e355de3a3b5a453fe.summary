in the swing : @entity1 , 63 , has become the first patient in the @entity3 to wear the @entity4 - allowing him to walk naturally for the first time in 40 years not so long ago bionic limbs were the stuff of tv science fiction dramas			1
but these days attaching robotic parts to human arms and legs is so advanced that they can even be used to improve a game of golf			0
the first exoskeletal brace marketed for leisure activities yesterday went on sale in @entity3			1
the £ 60,000 robotic support has been developed to help people with minor disabilities improve the way they walk or play sports			0
called the @entity23 , the device was yesterday demonstrated at a golf club in @entity26 by a 63 - year - old man who had suffered polio as a child			1
designed to wrap around the lower leg , the machine can be used for walking , cycling or even roller blading			1
the different activities are selected on a remote control and transmitted to the leg via wireless bluetooth technology , which then carries out the actions that are needed for that particular sport			1
the brace contains computers and sensors on the upper leg , sensing the movement of the muscles in the thigh and transferring them to the robotic knee support			2
it reduces strain in the joint and generates the power needed for movement , enabling people with minor movement disabilities - such as those experienced after a stroke - to employ a full range of actions			1
bionic exoskeletons were developed over the last decade to rehabilitate people who had been paralysed			0
first used by the @entity64 army , the first bionic suits were used to manipulate the bodies of disabled soldiers in order to stimulate their muscles			0
they were remarkably successful , the computer - controlled suits replicating natural body motions and triggering the motor control people had lost in accidents or strokes			2
the technology has now become so widely available that it is now available on general sale for the first time			2
perviously only available in hospitals as a rehabilitative tool , it is now cheap enough to offer to people to wear full time			0
orthotic firm @entity85 ’s @entity4 was launched in the @entity64 last year , and yesterday was placed on sale in @entity3			1
the different activities are selected on a remote control and transmitted to the leg via wireless bluetooth technology , which then carries out the actions that are needed for that particular sport former sports manager @entity1 , 63 , from south - west @entity26 , who strapped on the device at @entity94 yesterday , said : ‘ it ’s going to change my life			1
’ @entity97 left mr @entity1 ’s nerves so damaged as a child he was unable to walk and despite multiple operations , physiotherapy and treatments , he has relied on a locked - leg brace to help him move around since he was 14			1
he said : ‘ for as long as i can remember , i ’ve had to walk with a locked - knee , which is awkward , cumbersome and puts great strain on my lower back			2
‘ over the years i tried new braces , supports and therapies , but nothing helped me walk and so i stuck with my original steel callipers			0
@entity1 , who suffered polio as a child , who strapped on the device at @entity94 yesterday , said ' it ’s going to change my life ' ‘ the @entity4 is a revolution			1
i can walk naturally again , without fear that my leg will give way , leading to a fall			0
i can walk downstairs with a bent knee and without fear as the brace provides support intuitively			0
’ @entity124 of @entity85 said : ‘ this is the most exciting development in the orthotic industry in the last decade			0
‘ this is a device designed for people who do n’t have the full control of their legs or ca n’t bear weight without collapsing			0
‘ it ’s the first ‘ swing - phase ’ control orthosis , which means that the computer and sensors inside the device control the leg in space - just like the advanced prosthetic legs			2
‘ this means that it can help people walk , cycle ... even play a round of golf , naturally and comfortably			0
