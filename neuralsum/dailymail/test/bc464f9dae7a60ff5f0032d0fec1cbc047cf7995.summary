when the @entity1 , then aged 86 , was filmed ' jumping out of a plane ' during the opening ceremony of the @entity4 , no one was more surprised than her grandson , prince @entity5			1
describing her as an ' unbelievably good sport ' , he added : ' @entity8 got a sniff of a rumour on the night and the rumour mill was going into overdrive			0
' but , in fact , she did such a good performance that she 's been asked to star in the next @entity16 film			0
i 'm thrilled for her			0
just last week , she was spotted looking animated and crossing her fingers at the @entity35 while cheering on her filly , @entity37			0
although the two - year - old bay only managed second place , the @entity1 , who still goes to the races whenever she can , clearly enjoyed herself			2
her majesty is also a regular rider and is frequently spotted riding out in @entity42 on her black @entity44 pony @entity45 - despite , as she turns 89 , reaching an age where most other riders have hung up their hats for good			2
sense of humour : the @entity1 proved her sense of humour remains undiminished with her @entity16 spoof active : the queen still rides regularly and is pictured out in @entity42 last week long - standing love : @entity1 , pictured in 1968 and 1972 , has long adored all things equestrian but the @entity1 is an expert when it comes to defying her advancing years and , along with maintaining a schedule that would leave people a third of her age exhausted , continues to enjoy herself much as she always has			1
although recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over @entity67 on horseback - the @entity1 remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and , according to sources , is a familiar sight at her @entity42 stables			1
she is said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies , some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren , notably @entity78 's children , @entity79 and @entity16 , @entity80			0
her majesty also puts in regular appearances at the @entity82 and is frequently seen watching the action during the @entity84 - a tournament that takes place at the @entity86 in @entity42			2
although , unlike her grandsons @entity5 and @entity8 , the @entity1 has never played polo herself , she has long been a fan of the sport			0
showing her nerves : the @entity1 grimaces while watching her filly @entity37 last week shared love : the @entity92 also shares her love of racing and polo popular : while the @entity1 can not ride as much as she 'd like , she still has a heavy work schedule but while her advancing age has curtailed the @entity1 's ability to ride , she still partakes in many of the habits picked up as a young woman , among them a penchant for a pre-lunch gin and @entity105			2
like her mother , who lived to be 102 , her majesty is also said to be fond of a pre-dinner gin and tonic but turns down fancy fare in favour of plainer dishes			0
according to former royal chef @entity112 , a typical lunch for @entity1 is grilled @entity114 served with wilted greens - that followed by an afternoon tea with ' at least two kinds of sandwiches ' at four			0
for supper , the @entity1 has more fish or game such as pheasant sent to @entity42 from her estate at @entity124 or @entity125			2
perhaps this hearty but plain fare explains her continuing good health and her ability to manage what remains a heavy workload meetings : she meets the @entity133 pm once a week and ' regularly speaks ' to those elsewhere role : the @entity1 performing her role as @entity137 with a visit to an @entity140 culture show in 2002 state opening : @entity1 , here as @entity143 , opening @entity144 in @entity145 in 1977 patriotic : @entity1 , here of @entity148 and @entity149 , meeting children in @entity151 her majesty spends most afternoons welcoming incoming ambassadors to @entity155 , presiding over investitures or , as she did last week , taking part in visits on behalf of one of the 16 countries of which she is head of state			0
she also has a weekly audience with the @entity133 prime minister , currently @entity163 , and ' speaks regularly ' to the prime ministers of the 15 other countries where she is head of state , among them @entity167 's @entity166 and @entity169 's @entity168			0
under the @entity1 , the monarchy has also modernised and embraces the latest technology , including social media			1
the @entity1 is currently the world 's most followed royal , with her account , @ @entity175 , followed by 970,000 people			0
her first post , an anodyne comment about the opening of an exhibition at the @entity181 , went viral - as did her first photo - bomb			1
the moment , which came during last summer 's @entity184 , saw her majesty appear in the background of a selfie being taken by @entity188 player , @entity187 , 30			0
her majesty also made her first , if unscheduled , appearance in a selfie in june when 14 - year - old @entity191 darted in for a cheeky snap during a walkabout in @entity195 's @entity194			2
photo - bomb ! this snap of the queen by @entity167 hockey player @entity187 rapidly went viral first selfie : 14 - year - old @entity191 snaps a cheeky selfie with the @entity1 during a visit in @entity195 first tweet : the @entity1 sends her first official @entity204 message during a visit to the @entity181 beyond selfies and social media , the @entity1 continues to make waves in the sartorial world with her trademark shift dresses and colourful coats , all of which are regularly referenced by the world 's top designers			1
even her @entity217 handbags are enjoying renewed popularity , with the brand regularly selling out colourful special edition versions of her favourite Â£ 1,075 @entity223 style			1
at home , her family are enjoying a period of relative peace and , as she celebrates her 89th birthday , the @entity1 is about to become a great - grandmother for the fifth time			1
but for her majesty , who is spending today privately with her family at @entity232 , the imminent arrival is just one of a number of reasons to be pleased			1
still riding , still enjoying the races and still unafraid to surprise family and the public alike , the @entity1 , nearly ninety , surely is the world 's coolest great - grandmother			1
happy family : her majesty is about to become a great - grandmother for the fifth time royal family : the queen pictured with her family and the @entity245 at @entity247 's christening in 2013			1

the @entity1 is celebrating her 89th birthday today at home at @entity42
she is spending the day privately with prince @entity92 and her family
her majesty is enjoying renewed popularity , especially on social media
a snap of the @entity1 photo - bombing a hockey player went viral last year
