the character is depicted as a gangly , unnaturally tall man with a white and featureless face , who invariably dons a suit @entity35 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) were charged as adults for stabbing a girl 19 times and leaving her in the woods			1
they said they had done the attack ' to please @entity1 ' @entity44 , who dressed @entity1 for the @entity45 last week , told @entity46 the costume appealed to him because of his physical dimensions , rather than the macabre connotations			1
' i 'm 7 - feet tall and pretty gangly			2
@entity1 works for my build , plus it 's a pretty easy costume			1
i just bought the @entity54 skin suit and wore a black suit over the top			0
you do n't need to do makeup or anything			0
' i obviously did n't choose it because of the messed up stuff that happened in @entity62			1
' the costume was so convincing that at one stage , @entity65 actor @entity64 ran from the stage he was doing a q and a from because @entity44 began to approach			1
@entity69 told @entity44 to leave as he was disrupting the session			1
@entity44 says it was his first time attending @entity2 , though he had been to similar events in the same costume without any difficulties			1
' i 've been to @entity75 and @entity76 with the @entity1 routine			1
it was never a problem			0
funnily enough i attended both days , but it was only on the sunday that i was asked to leave			0
' @entity44 was eventually kicked out by security for invading the personal space of members of the crowd			1
he said that while he did make physical contact with members of the public , he did not see it as inappropriate			2
' i was softly poking people , pacing my palm on their shoulders then taking it away			0
i touched a couple of peoples hair			1
it would n't say it was improper			0
' ' for the most part , people were into it			0
most of them asked for photographs aftrerwards or played along with it			0
they pretty much all freaked out			0
' @entity44 said he was approached for photos by countless members of the crowd @entity44 says that first time attending @entity2 , though he had been to similar events in the same costume without any difficulties @entity44 said he made physical contact with members of the crowd , however it was not inappropriate nonetheless , @entity44 regrets his conduct			1
' i regret it because i do n't generally like getting too much attention			0
about 90 per cent of the reactions online have been negative			2
the discussions sort of snowballed			0
' @entity44 was warned at 1pm , when he found himself encircled by security			1
' i can only see about four feet ahead of me in the suit , but when i took the mask off i could see they had surrounded me			0
they said i needed to stop invading peoples personal space			1
' after that , he says he was closely monitored			0
' i hung by the @entity127 stage for a few hours after that			0
i did n't touch anybody else , and i was still being approached for photos			0
eventually the guards came up and said i was n't following the instructions and that i had to leave			0
' he believes the security overreacted , since he abided by their first warning			2
@entity44 added that he probably wo n't return to any other @entity45 events , since anyone in a @entity1 costume will be ' discriminated against			1
' ' if it 's the same security , i wo n't be going back			2
i 'll be on their radar			0
it wo n't be much fun			0
' @entity44 said he regrets his behaviour because it garnered too much negative attention online the event director of @entity2 , @entity149 , confirmed that @entity44 was told to leave the event the event director of @entity2 , @entity149 , told @entity46 that a member of the crowd in a @entity1 costume was was asked to leave the event after ' inappropriate behaviour			1
' ' while management did not witness every single incident , the fact a number of complaints were made indicated there was an issue which needed to be addressed straight away , ' she said			2
' @entity2 has a zero - tolerance policy on any form of harassment at these events			2
anything that is reported to staff and security is immediately acted upon in the appropriate manner			2
' comic - con events have a strict code on harassment			2
in july , a group of @entity176 organisers pressured the country 's premier fan convention to crack down on unwanted physical contact at the events , which is generally a prominent complaint			0
in response , organisers at @entity45 conventions in some cities have adopted tough anti-harassment policie , and an interactive @entity188 map was created to collect and display the stories of harassment experienced by cosplayers at @entity45 conventions .			0

@entity44 dressed as @entity1 , a fictional character that originated online , for the event in @entity3
@entity1 is *controversial* *due* to links to a number of violent acts in @entity62 this year , *including* the stabbing of a 12 - year - old girl
@entity44 says he chose the costume because it *‘* matches his build *’*
he was kicked out of the event by security for invading crowd members personal space
@entity44 says though he poked the crowd and touched them on the shoulder and hair , the security *overacted* by kicking him out
