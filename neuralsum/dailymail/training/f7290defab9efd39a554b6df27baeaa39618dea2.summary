published : 08:19 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 1 april 2013 researchers believe they may have found the first meteorite from @entity2 to have been found on @entity3			2
the unusual green rock , called @entity5 7325 , was spotted in southern @entity6 in 2012 , comprising 35 fragments totaling about 345 grams			1
experts now believe it may have come from the surface of @entity2			0
this green meteorite that landed in @entity6 in 2012 could be from @entity2 , researchers believe - making it the first @entity2 meteorite found on @entity3 messenger is the first spacecraft ever to orbit the planet @entity2			1
the spacecraft 's seven scientific instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history and evolution of the planet closest to the @entity24 during its one - year primary mission , @entity14 acquired 88,746 images			0
it is now in an extended mission , during which plans call for the acquisition of more than 80,000 additional images the dark green stones were purchased by meteorite dealer @entity33 , who sent samples of @entity5 to researcher @entity35 of the @entity36 , a specialist in meteorites of planetary origin			1
@entity35 found that the fragments contained surprisingly little iron but considerable amounts of magnesium , aluminum , and calcium silicates			2
this matches with observations from @entity48 's messenger spacecraft of the surface crust of @entity2			0
however , the rock did have higher than expected amounts of calcium silicates , leading @entity35 to speculate the fragments of @entity5 could have come from a deeper part of @entity2 â€™s crust , excavated by a powerful impact event and launched into space , eventually finding their way to @entity3			1
a recent high resolution image of the surface of @entity2 : researchers now believe they may have found the first confirmed meteorite from the planet on @entity3 ' it might be a sample from @entity2 , or it might be a sample from a body smaller than @entity2 but [ which ] is like @entity2 , ' said @entity35 , who unveiled the new findings this month at the 44th annual @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72			0
@entity35 thinks that the meteorite was created and eventually ejected from a planet or other body that had flowing magma on its surface at some point in its history			0
evidence suggests that the rock could have been formed as ' scum ' on the top of the magma , @entity35 said .			2
