by @entity1 medical correspondent trials are beginning for a @entity4 drug that could prolong the lives of thousands of women with advanced breast cancer			1
the drug , called irosustat , is designed to work with existing therapies to block the production of oestrogen , which fuels the cancer in two - thirds of cases			1
the pioneering study is being led by professor @entity18			0
he said if the trial shows the new pill is having an effect , it could be available within three years			1
‘ most breast cancers need oestrogen to grow and there are two ways the body can make it , ’ he said			2
‘ currently , we ’re only able to use a hormone drug to block one of these places , but with the introduction of irosustat , we ’re hoping to prove that we can also block the other one			2
’ tests : trials are beginning for a @entity4 drug , irosusat , which is designed to work with existing therapies to block the production of oestrogen ( file picture ) each year around 50,000 women in the @entity4 are diagnosed with breast cancer , and 12,000 die from the disease			1
professor @entity18 , a medical oncologist at @entity46 , collaborating with a team from the @entity48 at the @entity49 and the @entity50 , heads the pioneering @entity52 study , which is being managed by @entity53			0
the drug was also developed at @entity53			0
after promising results in early tests , 27 women are being recruited for the trial			0
professor @entity18 plans to run full - blown trials from 2015			0
he said : ‘ it could possibly be in clinical use in three years and the good news is that this is a home - grown drug , it was developed in a lab in the @entity4			2
’ collaboration : oncologist @entity18 from the @entity46 in the @entity68 is working with a team from the @entity48 at the @entity49 , pictured , and the @entity50 the first patient was signed up to the trial in september and has been taking irosustat alongside her traditional hormone treatment , anastrozole , for the past four weeks			1
one of the first patients recruited said : ‘ i found out i had secondary breast cancer in january , nine years after i ’d had a mastectomy and was given the all clear			1
‘ it was a shock but i ’ve always had the upmost trust in my doctors and knew they ’d do what they could			0
‘ unfortunately , my cancer is only treatable , not curable , so the main aim is to try and make sure it does n’t grow			0
‘ a few weeks ago , i had a routine check - up and was informed that the cancer had become slightly more aggressive , so i was referred to professor @entity18 , who told me about the trial			0
‘ i knew instantly that i wanted to take part as i have seven young grandchildren and will do anything to stay around for them for as long as possible			0
checks : if the trials show that the new pill is having an effect , it could be available within three years ( file picture ) ‘ i ’ve only been taking the additional hormone treatment for three weeks but i ’m optimistic about the future and if i hear that my cancer has shrunk , even a tiny bit , as a result , i ’ll be over the moon			1
’ thousands of women are given aromatase inhibitors ( @entity108 ) drugs , which include anastrozole , letrozole and exemestane , after chemotherapy			0
the treatment aims to ensure that the cancer does n’t come back , or to prevent the tumour from growing by shutting down the body ’s supply of oestrogen			1
these drugs only work after the menopause in women with oestrogen receptor positive ( er positive ) breast cancer – around two thirds			2
@entity124 is given alongside @entity108 drugs to block a different pathway of oestrogen production , by stopping a reservoir of a precursor hormone from being converted into oestrogen .			1

drug irosusat is being trialled by patients in @entity133 and the @entity68
treatment works to block production of oestrogen , which can fuel cancer
if trials show the new pill is working it could be available within three years
