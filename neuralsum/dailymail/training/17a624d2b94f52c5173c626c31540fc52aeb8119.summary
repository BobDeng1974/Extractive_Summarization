by @entity0 published : 10:29 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 11:45 est , 11 september 2013 big supermarkets which put customers at risk from a killer food poisoning bug found on chicken are to be identified on ‘ name and shame ’ lists			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) has announced that it is to carry out regular tests on chicken sold on the high street for the presence of campylobacter			1
lists of infection levels will be published in a bid to shame the stores into taking action following years of failure to deliver safe and clean chicken			1
the bug is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the @entity26 , responsible for an estimated 580,000 cases of illness , 22,000 hospital admissions and 140 deaths			1
named and shamed : the @entity9 will carry out regular tests on chickens sold in supermarkets , which have been accused of putting customers at risk of food poisoning the cost of treating the sickness and lost days of work , quite apart from the human misery , is put at £ 900million a year			1
an official study published in 2009 revealed that two in three of all fresh chicken on shelves was contaminated with campylobacter			2
more than one in four – 27per cent – were classed as being highly contaminated			0
however , despite the fact the @entity9 has asked supermarkets and farmers to make combatting campylobacter a top priority , the situation appears to be getting worse with more cases of human infection			1
the board of the official watchdog today agreed a new action plan that will include carrying out regular supermarket tests and publishing name and shame lists			1
the watchdog is also investigating new ways to kill the bug before it reaches the high street			2
these include washing the chicken with lactic acid and flash freezing for a few seconds			0
farmers are under pressure to stop the spread of the disease within their flocks , while consumers will be given advice on how to handle and cook chicken			0
an @entity9 paper on the food poisoning crisis warned : ‘ in addition to the attendant economic costs , cases cause inconvenience , discomfort and misery to those who become infected and a small proportion of cases result in death or long - term consequences , such as reactive arthritis , irritable bowel syndrome and @entity94 , the latter of which affects the peripheral nervous system			1
’ risk : @entity96 , the bug found in unclean chicken , is to blame for 580,000 cases of illness , 22,000 hospital admissions and 140 deaths in the @entity26 @entity9 chief executive , @entity103 , told board members urgent action is needed to protect the public			1
‘ every week that goes by people are suffering , ’ she said			0
there is an official target to reduce the proportion of chicken that is heavily contaminated from around one in four to one in ten			0
however , miss @entity103 said the target is not tough enough and is the ‘ very least ’ that is needed to protect families			0
‘ none of us as consumers would feel comfortable that 10per cent of chicken was in the most contaminated band , ’ she said			0
‘ the chief executive of one of the very big producers said to me the other day , ‘ if this bug was turning our chicken green , we would have sorted it out by now ’			2
’ she added that pressure needs to be brought on supermarkets and producers , saying : ‘ we have got to create an environment where they are that motivated … we need to create more urgency			2
‘ this has been treated as a technical issue			0
we are now saying this is a public health issue , a strategic issue and significant risk to your businesses			2
’ board member , dr @entity138 , called for tough action saying : ‘ @entity96 needs to be heard loud and clear out there			0
‘ this is about urgency and about trying to link the incentives and sanctions that will drive the industry to deliver what we need			0
’ the food director at the @entity149 , @entity150 , insisted that supermarkets are already tackling the problem			1
‘ retailers fully support the @entity9 ’s objective to reduce campylobacter and are investing in their supply chains working with farmers and processors to identify effective controls , ’ he said			1
top priority : despite the @entity9 ordering supermarkets and farmers to make combating the bug a top priority , the number of cases keep rising ‘ measures implemented include introducing leak - proof packaging on all whole birds to control the spread of any contamination and provision of on - pack labelling which advises consumers on how to safely handle and prepare poultry			1
‘ consumer messaging is repeated using other channels including websites and in - store magazines			0
@entity96 is completely killed by normal cooking so providing people prepare chicken properly and follow sensible hygiene practices they 're at no risk and should not be put off buying an affordable and nutritious meat			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity96 is a complex organism that is difficult to control , and scientific evidence has n’t provided an effective solution so far			0
the industry is working hard to tackle this shared issue and we require continued support from the government to achieve this , ’ he said .			0

the @entity9 to ' name and shame ' supermarkets putting customers at risk
*inspectors* will carry out regular tests on chickens to look for the presence of killer food poisoning bug
