@entity0 faces former world champion @entity1 on september 13 at the @entity2 in @entity3 in what i believe will be the toughest fight of his career			1
@entity8 won the @entity10 bantamweight title in 2013 before losing to the hugely talented @entity11 in the only loss of his career			1
i give @entity8 plenty of credit for taking this fight - it ’s been a hard task matching @entity0			1
his devastating knockout of @entity20 in his last fight has made many in the division much less forthcoming			1
@entity0 asked for the @entity24 unification but they simply do n’t fancy the fight - we even offered to come to the @entity28 and again he was avoided			1
time to shine : @entity0 will face @entity1 in @entity3 in september as @entity0 continues to send big statements to the vision , we now hope @entity32 ’s @entity31 can beat @entity33 in september and then we can finally give the public the fight they want to see			1
it is one of the biggest fights out there and we want to make it			1
taking the division by storm : @entity0 has proved a force to be reckoned with in the bantamweight division also on the @entity3 bill , @entity46 continues his impressive march in the lightweight division when he challenges former word champion @entity50 and unbeaten star @entity51 faces @entity53 ’s @entity52 with the winner becoming the mandatory challenger for @entity58 ’s @entity57 lightweight title			1
on the bill : @entity46 will fight on the undercard of the @entity3 ’s @entity61 returns in an expected barn burner against @entity63 and heavyweight sensation @entity64 will now make his @entity3 debut after his @entity66 fight was postponed			1
i 'm continuing talks with @entity70 over a fight between @entity72 and @entity73 on january 24 in @entity74			1
i wish i had more to say but it 's going slowly			2
we still have the same options of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
let 's wait and see			2
i watched the boxing at the @entity83 very closely , with one eye on who might make a good professional signing			2
it was nice to see @entity88 , my pre-tournament tip , win the gold – he was brilliant			1
golden moment : @entity88 celebrates winning gold at the @entity83 in @entity92 he was like a little @entity72 in there , trading away with true grit at times			1
he ’s confident and has talent			2
i was impressed , as i was by @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			2
there is some great talent coming through			2
impressive : @entity103 tipped @entity88 for glory before the games what all of them must now decide is whether to stick or twist			1
all of them will want to win titles as a professional , but the lure of a gold medal in the @entity114 is always there			2
that is a massive appeal for any amateur			2
the gamble for them would be to wait instead of switching now when their profile is high			0
i can reveal here that @entity126 ’ proposed comeback fight in @entity3 on september 13 has been moved because of an elbow injury he picked up against @entity128			1
he will now fight on october 4 in @entity130 , on a bill including @entity132 and @entity133			0
@entity134 will also make his comeback after his light - middleweight world title challenge in june			1
@entity137 has been in @entity74 for a week as he prepares for his world title shot at @entity139 on august 16			0
he has adjusted well to the time difference and is training hard			0
he sounds so confident every time i talk to him			0
he is looking sensational in sparring and i ca n’t wait to get out there next week and enjoy the build up to this huge fight			1
fighting fit : @entity137 is in @entity74 preparing for his @entity147 fight with @entity139 there has been some noise made about the drug testing arrangements after the fight date was changed and i can confirm that both fighters have now been tested and will be again in the future			0
i think it ’s an extremely important part of our sport that needs close attention			0
chance to shine : @entity133 will fight on the @entity137 undercard on @entity137 ’s card , i am also using @entity133 and @entity160 , one of our 2012 gold medallists			0
they have been standout fights for me in the past year			0
@entity160 is fighting again after his short break from the sport for family reasons , while @entity133 does no wrong at the moment			0
he is such an enormous talent and is heading for a title shot in the next year to 18 months			0
they will fight six - rounders and both will be benefit from the experience and exposure			0
i will be talking with @entity177 this week to try to iron out some more details about his rematch with @entity180			0
the two dates under consideration are still november 1 in @entity3 or november 29 in @entity183			0
rematch : at @entity186 we have just launched @entity187 , which we ’re very excited about			0
i ’ve teamed up with @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 , who are all respected @entity57 promoters , and we are now streaming live coverage online of 10 additional fight nights a year			0
you ’ve seen us invest heavily in the elite level of the sport and in the best young talent , and this helps us get involved in all levels of the sport			0
