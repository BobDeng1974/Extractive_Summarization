i am determined not to do my usual @entity2 trick of putting on nearly a stone during december			2
that does n't mean living like a monk for the next four weeks but i am going to counter the effects of excessive booze and food calories by upping my work - outs with some @entity12 ( hit ) home and gym sessions			2
clearly your appearance for home sessions is not a worry and you can go sans make - up for that , but at the gym a lot of women would think that ’s not acceptable			1
and i 'm one of them			0
for an hour ’s open - plan gym session i would opt for some foundation cover , light eye make - up and a nude lip as you can see in the video below for @entity32 : @entity53 – made in @entity55 ’s fitness video which has been released this week			1
@entity29 knows that some may sneer but she says she ca n't go to the gym without a little bit of make - up the hour - long video has me doing torturous work - out sessions with me , @entity32 , @entity32 and @entity32			1
my prep for the work - outs is five minutes of stretches , 15 minutes of light base make - up prep ( more of that later ) , and to take one or two @entity69 supplements for an energy boost in the mornings and help with fat burning			1
as you can see in the footage i had opted for a light oil free foundation – @entity76 – this will breathe better with my skin when getting hot , and sweat wo n’t form underneath so it ’s less likely to smear and wo n’t create break - outs or spots			0
if you are going for particularly heavy cardio work then you may prefer to wear a tinted moisturiser or @entity84 like @entity85 instead of foundation – but because my work - out session was under harsh studio lights ( and i was being filmed ! ) i opted for foundation			0
for a workout session @entity29 usually opts for a light coverage of foundation , subtle eye make - up and a nude lip @entity29 says that with her beauty tips you can run as much as you like without worrying about your make - up running too also do n’t forget that during summer months it ’s good to wear a tinted sunblock for that run in the park to protect from the sun damage – i particularly like the @entity102			1
clearly it ’s best to go little and light on the whole look for the gym – you will look a tad ridiculous if you ’ve put the full saturday night war - paint on , but a bit of powder blush like @entity110 to give your cheeks some colour is acceptable – ( do n’t overdo it though as you are likely to get red cheeks from working out anyway )			0
in the @entity32 : @entity53 video i am also wearing @entity116 4 in 1 @entity117 , and yes i admit it i ’ve got fake lashes on			0
clearly it ’s not worth putting lashes on for the gym , but i had just had mine done professionally and there was no way i was taking them off			0
in one of the other videos i had applied quite a heavy bit of contouring – but this was just for the cameras , as it 'd be way too much for a regular gym work - out			0
@entity29 enjoys a post workout smoothie with ( @entity133 ) @entity32 , @entity32 and @entity32 i know there will be a hardcore clan of gym - bunnies out there who will think my gym make - up tips are bonkers , but most women are likely to concede that they would use a concealer to cover up the odd pimple or blemish – and @entity145 – is perfect for that , containing salicylic acid which will attack the bacteria that forms spots as well			1
finally , whether you wear make - up in the gym or not , it is essential that you cleanse your skin thoroughly afterwards , as well as moisturise			1
leaving sweat in your pores , especially under make - up , will cause break - outs			1
so if you do apply make - up for a gym session , using a multi-tasking cleanser like @entity162 afterwards , which cleanses , tones and purifies the skin in one step			2
follow up with a redness - reducing moisturiser such as @entity168 fortifying anti-redness moisturiser			0
you can get all the products i 've mentioned from @entity171 , but here are a few budget alternatives if you are watching the pennies at this rather expensive time of year			0
sleek oil - free creme to @entity176 @entity178 @entity179 in @entity180 @entity181 until next time , @entity29 xxx			2
