by @entity1 reporter football players who suffer concussion should only be allowed back on the pitch after being examined by an independent doctor , say medics			1
the proposal backs the world players ’ union @entity8 , which criticised @entity10 over its handling of head injuries during the @entity13 and in particular @entity15 defender @entity14 overruling his team doctors ’ advice to be substituted			1
in an editorial published in @entity20 , medics say that @entity10 needs to get its house in order before the next @entity13 : ‘ changes are clearly needed to protect athletes			0
’ @entity14 lies on the ground after taking a blow to the head during @entity29 's game with @entity30 during the @entity13 the doctors say players must be taken off if there is any suspicion of head injury as it has been linked to dementia and other problems in later life			1
@entity14 continued playing in the game which saw his @entity29 side beat @entity30 “ ' after a blow to the head that left him in an apparent state of concussion			1
' as a result @entity8 called on @entity10 to ' conduct a thorough investigation into its own competition concussion protocol which failed to protect ' the @entity15			1
it called for ' a review of the laws of the game so that a player with a suspected concussion can be temporarily replaced whilst being diagnosed			0
' it stressed : ' @entity54 must set the standard for player health and safety to educate the international football community			0
doctors say players must be taken off the pitch if there is any suspicion of head injury ' medical evidence shows that a person faces the risk of very serious brain injury , or worse , if he or she suffers a severe head trauma from a concussive blow			2
' football is awash with incidents in which players suffer potentially concussive blows to the head and stay on the pitch			2
in @entity14 ’s case , he demanded to play on while overruling advice from @entity29 ’s team physician for him to be immediately substituted			2
' @entity8 understands that in the heat of the moment , faced by the pressures of such an important international stage , many players would react in this way , but there are times when the players also need protection from making any rash decisions			1
' furthermore , @entity8 states any sideline concussion assessment must not be conducted solely by a national team physician			2
' @entity30 player @entity93 ran into @entity14 knocking the defender in the face with his knee it said if there is any suspicion of injury the only safe thing would be to take players off as a range of symptoms can last for weeks or months afterwards and has been linked to dementia in later life			1

' a range of symptoms such as headache and dizziness can continue for weeks or even months after a concussion ; the causes of post-concussion syndrome are unclear and do not seem to correlate with the severity of injury			0
' medics said the long - term consequences of repeated mild @entity112 have been recognised for some time in the boxing world where symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity130 ) , including dementia , appears years or decades after brain trauma			0
despite the collision , @entity14 refused to leave the field and carried on playing for the rest of the match the editorial called for better education to prevent , recognise and respond to the effects of mild head injuries in sport while more research into the short and long - term effects of mild @entity112 was needed			1
it added : ' concussion signs and symptoms are not necessarily sensitive indicators of brain injury and we know that these symptoms can pass quickly even when neurological damage remains			0
' advanced neuroimaging and biomarkers are needed to diagnose and monitor @entity130 - characterised by progressive tauopathy and neurodegeneration - during life			0
' gives us hope that when teams gather in four year ’s time for the 2018 @entity13 , football and other sports will feel a safer place for athletes of all ages			0
