bus group tycoon @entity0 is fronting a new £ 6.5million rescue plan for @entity2			1
the crisis - hit @entity4 outfit needs to find £ 8.3m before april 1 or face another financial meltdown			1
now according to reports in several newspapers on saturday morning , @entity0 has joined forces with wealthy @entity12 supporters @entity10 and @entity13 to offer to underwrite a new shares issue			2
the move could prove to be a lifeline for the club after the @entity18 announced on christmas eve that it had rejected @entity21 owner @entity20 's attempts to increase his involvement with the @entity24 champions			1
@entity25 giants @entity2 desperately need to find £ 8.3million before april 1 or face another financial meltdown @entity28 chiefs have been informed of the offer , which would see @entity31 's consortium buy all 40,739,000 shares set to be issued after the board won a vote at last week 's agm giving it the right to raise new equity			1
@entity0 , founder of the successful @entity38 , is reported to have a personal fortune of around £ 78m			2
he was part of the @entity42 consortium which tried to save the club from liquidation almost three years ago			0
@entity10 , meanwhile , loaned the club £ 1m earlier this year to stave off another disaster , while @entity47 - based @entity13 bought a 3.2 per cent stake just last month			2
the offer - which also includes a demand for two board seats - was lodged with chairman @entity52 immediately after he presided over the stormy shareholder meeting last monday			0
with @entity20 's attempts to boost his stake in @entity2 from 8.92 per cent to 29.9 per cent set to be blocked by the @entity18 , the club now face three choices			1
bus group tycoon and prospective @entity2 investor @entity31 ( centre ) watches a game at @entity4 they could accept the @entity31 consortium 's offer , or instead turn to the rejected £ 16m investment plan lodged by former old co-director @entity66 in october , which remains on the table			1
alternatively , they could challenge the @entity18 's stance on @entity20 through the courts and risk further punishment from the governing body in the meantime			1
but the @entity76 group have already gone on the attack , criticising the decision by @entity20 and @entity79 - the football board chairman who controls around 26 per cent of the club through shares and proxies - to reject resolution nine at the agm			2
the motion would have given the club the right to have issued shares without first offering them to existing shareholders but the vote went 55 - 45 against it			0
observers viewed that as an attempt by the board to keep any fresh investment in - house and a spokesman for the @entity76 group said : ' we find it disturbing that @entity100 nine , which would have made it possible to issue shares for cash to new shareholders , failed to gain approval			0
the @entity18 rejected @entity21 owner @entity20 's attempts to increase his stake earlier this week ' everyone knows the company is in dire need of fresh and significant investment and yet shareholders represented on the board decided to vote against investment from new shareholders			1
' presumably , they believed the @entity18 would clear the way for @entity20 to increase his holding but we now know that this was not approved			1
the @entity18 would have been aware there is a credible alternative and we would like to make sure the fans are aware of that , too			0
' our offer was based on @entity100 being passed , but this was blocked			0
however , as existing shareholders we still believe it should be possible for us to gain a significant holding and are ready to invest in a new share issue			0
' our money is in place , proof of funding has been shown to the chairman and the company 's nomad			0
we are trying our best to do what is right for @entity2 and the supporters			0
' why on earth would anyone not want a hugely successful businessman like @entity31 involved ? '			0
