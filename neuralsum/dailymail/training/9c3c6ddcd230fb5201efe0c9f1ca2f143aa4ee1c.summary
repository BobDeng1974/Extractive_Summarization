by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 10 october 2013 the explosive revelation threatens to destroy mr @entity3 's claims that a separate @entity4 could use its oil wealth to transform the economy a devastating private dossier for @entity9 ministers has sparked warnings that independence could trigger higher taxes or deeper spending cuts			1
@entity15 briefing documents , seen by the @entity4 @entity16 , expose the huge risks in @entity3 ’s flagship policy to put @entity20 oil revenues in a savings account for the future			1
the explosive revelation threatens to destroy mr @entity3 ’s claims that a separate @entity4 could use its oil wealth to transform the economy			1
one of the papers , written by a top economic adviser to the government , explains that @entity4 ran a deficit for 20 of the last 21 years – even during the boom years			1
if @entity4 had been independent throughout that period , the expert states that oil revenues would have been required to fund vital public services such as the @entity33 , schools and policing			1
the analysis , written for ministers in march last year but only published now under @entity39 legislation , concludes : ' given @entity4 ’s fiscal position since 1990 , if the @entity41 had adopted any of these rules in the past there would have had to be an accompanying reduction in public spending , increase in taxation or higher borrowing to ensure that the public finances continued to balance			2
' the publication of the private papers comes only days after the @entity41 ’s fiscal commission working group released a public report that recommended the creation of an oil fund			0
last week , finance secretary @entity55 said the ‘ economic rationale ’ for a fund is ‘ powerful ’ and he went on to blast @entity56 for failing to put aside oil revenues in past decades			2
yesterday , a government spokesman insisted that a separate @entity4 would be running a budget surplus before investments are made into a savings fund			2
but former chancellor @entity64 – chairman of the @entity66 campaign – yesterday accused the @entity9 of trying to ‘ deceive ’ voters			0
' last week they said they could set up an oil fund at no cost , ' he said			0
' it is now clear that their own private advice says that there would need to be tax rises , spending cuts or more borrowing – or all three			0
the @entity9 have quite deliberately set out to deceive the @entity4 public			2
' this internal @entity9 paper also confirms that , in all but one of the last 20 years , all the oil money has been spent on public services in @entity4 yet @entity9 ministers tell us it ’s just a bonus and not the basis of our economy			1
' @entity4 does n’t have to be faced with this choice			2
being part of the @entity91 means we have the strength of a bigger economy without the risk of oil volatility			2
' thousands of pro-independence campaigners march through @entity97 on september 21,2013 women are a ' key barrier ' to @entity3 's dream of independence , according to new research			1
analysis by the non-partisan what @entity4 thinks organisation has found that 66 per cent of women are likely to vote no in next year 's referendum , based on latest polling figures			1
that compares to 53 per cent of men , using data from various polls carried out between july and september			0
the ' gender divide ' suggests women are less willing to give credence to mr @entity3 's claims			1
what @entity4 @entity117 states : ' the uncertainty about independence felt by women is a key barrier to a @entity123 vote			0
' @entity124 set up its own oil fund in 1990 and currently has around £ 450billion put aside - making it the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world			0
in contrast , the @entity91 government – in line with other large nations such as the @entity132 – spends the money it raises through offshore taxes on public the services and uses it to keep personal taxes low			0
according to the government ’s @entity140 in a report to @entity9 ministers last week , money could start being put into an oil fund within a year of independence			0
however , the private document written last march by @entity147 of the fiscal analysis team in the @entity149 states : ' there has only been one year since 1990 when tax receipts have exceeded total public spending			0
' this suggests that over this period @entity20 receipts would have been required to fund public services in @entity4			0
therefore if the @entity41 had wished to establish an oil fund , it would have had to reduce public spending , increase taxation or increase public sector borrowing			0
' a second paper for ministers , with no named author or date , adds : ' there is likely to be significant demand , at least in the years immediately following independence , to use any additional resources to support public services and reduce public sector debt rather than investing in an oil fund			0
' @entity20 oil revenues would have to be spent on essential public services , the report states last night , a @entity41 spokesman claimed the papers ‘ confirm exactly what we have said on this issue ’			0
' as the finance secretary has said , the assumption that @entity4 would have to run an absolute surplus before investing in an oil savings fund " has been reflected in the @entity41 ’s early thinking on the subject " , he said			1
' however , these papers have been overtaken by the expert report of the @entity140 , who have recommended that an independent @entity4 should set up a stabilisation fund and a longer term oil savings fund			1
' based on the model outlined by the working group , @entity4 could consider investing modest sums into a long - term savings fund without an offsetting change to public spending or taxation potentially as early as 2017 - 18			1
' he added : ' oil is the bonus rather than the basis for an independent @entity4 ’s economy			1

reports cast doubt on @entity3 's claims that oil will transform economy
@entity4 ran deficit for 20 of the last 21 years - even during boom times
money will have to be spent on essentials , claims top economic advisor
