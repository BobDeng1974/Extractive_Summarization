by @entity0 suspected war criminal : @entity2 last week a suspected war criminal accused of playing a role in the slaughter of nearly a million @entity6 is working as a taxi driver in @entity8 and can not be deported because of human rights laws			1
@entity10 , 41 , is alleged by the @entity12 's @entity11 to have helped @entity14 soldiers kill members of the @entity17 ethnic group during the genocide in 1994			2
as a prominent member of the ruling party which is accused of planning the genocide in the @entity23 country , he is also alleged to have made speeches in favour of the massacre			2
but for the past 13 years @entity10 has been living in @entity8 and now works as a mini-cab driver in @entity28 , @entity29			2
@entity10 arrived in @entity8 in 1999 after @entity6 was taken over by a @entity17 - dominated party			1
he sought asylum , but his application was turned down			2
an immigration tribunal has since ruled he does not qualify for refugee or humanitarian protection in @entity8 because he is suspected of crimes against humanity in @entity6			2
but he has been allowed to remain because of a precedent set in the @entity39 which let four suspected @entity6 war criminals stay in @entity8 on the basis that they would not get a fair trial in their home country , breaching their human rights			1
when @entity45 approached @entity10 last week in the car park of a hotel in @entity28 to ask him about the allegations , he denied any involvement in the genocide and flew into a rage			2
he refused to answer further questions and then called police and falsely accused the reporter of racially assaulting him and spitting on him			1
officers questioned him and the reporter – then issued @entity10 with an £ 80 spot fine for wasting police time			1
the genocide in @entity6 began after a plane carrying the @entity14 president @entity61 , leader of the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) party , was shot down in april 1994			1
the @entity63 government blamed @entity17 rebels from the @entity66 , and this sparked the massacre of almost a million @entity17			2
@entity10 is a @entity14 from the village of @entity70 in north @entity6 , the same village as mr @entity61			2
@entity10 's brother @entity71 was chief of the @entity72 to mr @entity61 and also died when their plane was shot down			0
the immigration tribunal heard that while studying biology and chemistry at the @entity78 from 1992 - 94 , @entity10 was leader of the @entity81 campus @entity63 party			1
in 1999 @entity10 fled @entity6 – leaving behind his wife and child – and came to @entity8			0
the tribunal was told that since arriving , @entity10 had fathered a boy to a @entity87 nurse but they broke up because she claimed he was aggressive			0
it is understood he lived in a council house near @entity90 , @entity91 , but has now moved			0
@entity10 had his first asylum application refused by the @entity93 in 1999 but in 2002 he was granted exceptional leave to remain			1
when it was due to expire at the end of 2005 , he claimed indefinite leave to remain but the @entity93 rejected this in april 2009 because it believes he is a war criminal			1
genocide : a young boy stands beside a pile of slaughtered @entity17 's in @entity103 during the @entity104 this decision was based on a report by the @entity12 's @entity11 which said ' there are serious reasons for considering the subject committed , aided , abetted or otherwise assisted in the commission of crimes against humanity and / or genocide '			0
in august 2009 , following the @entity39 ruling that year on the four suspected @entity6 war criminals , the @entity93 granted @entity10 discretionary leave to remain			1
but he appealed against the @entity93 's decision not to grant him indefinite leave to remain and the case was heard at the immigration tribunal in july 2010 , where a judge dismissed his asylum claim but granted him humanitarian protection			1
the @entity93 challenged this ruling and a hearing at the @entity128 and @entity129 found in its favour			1
the tribunal heard that in the first week of may 1994 – during the genocide – @entity10 travelled from his home in @entity70 to the @entity81 campus			1
he claims it was to collect his books and studying material , but the @entity93 alleges he returned to help identify @entity17 to the soldiers			1
the remains of victims laid to rest at the @entity141 , @entity6 on the anniversary of the 1994 @entity143 the @entity93 claimed that as the leader of the student @entity63 party he had admitted possessing a list of @entity14 students which could have been used to identify @entity17 students for killing			1
the @entity93 believed it was ' neither plausible nor credible ' that he had returned to collect his books and ' was much more likely that [ he ] had returned to participate in the genocide and had done so '			1
in ruling that he did not qualify for humanitarian protection , the immigration judges said : ' the claimant may not have killed anyone himself , but his hands are not clean			0
he did know both what was planned , what was happening , and was complicit in it			0
' last night @entity161 , @entity162 mp for @entity163 and @entity164 , who has tabled a @entity165 to replace the @entity166 with a @entity8 @entity165 , said : ' it 's extraordinary that someone suspected of genocide should be driving a taxi			0
they should be before a court facing charges			0
' anyone suspected of serious crimes like genocide should face justice and the @entity166 should not obstruct the proper course of justice			0
' @entity180 , vice-chairman of the @entity182 think - tank , said : ' for reasons that will baffle most @entity8 people we can not send him back to @entity6			1
this can not be right			0
' the @entity12 said : ' anyone accused of war crimes should be put on trial in their home country and even when the courts rule against us , we keep these cases under constant review			1
meanwhile we impose stringent reporting and employment restrictions			0
we will not allow the @entity8 to become a refuge for war criminals			2
' after speaking to our reporter , @entity10 emailed @entity45 and again complained he was racially abused and spat on , and claimed publication of the story would breach his human rights			1
he wrote : ' i entirely refute any allegation that i was involved in the commission of genocide in @entity6 and indeed any such related allegation			0
' the @entity45 left a message with @entity10 's immigration solicitors but they failed to respond			0
what happened when an @entity213 reporter approached mr @entity10			1
@entity0 : are you @entity10 ? @entity2 : yes			0
@entity215 : are you from @entity6 ? @entity2 : yes			0
@entity215 : i 'm a newspaper reporter from @entity45			0
we are looking at an immigration tribunal case			0
we understand that you moved here in 1999			0
is that correct ? @entity2 : yes , that is correct			0
@entity215 : and you were a student leader at the @entity63 party at university ? @entity2 : what is this ? [ he walks away and gets inside his taxi			2
] @entity215 : we understand that the @entity93 believes you took part in acts of genocide ? we are running a story , would you like to make a comment ? @entity2 : i do n't know you , man [ starts engine ]			1
@entity215 : it 's not assault			0
i 'm just asking if it 's true what the @entity93 say			1
@entity2 : i do n't know what you are talking about			0
i have nothing to answer with you , i have nothing to answer			0
@entity215 : did you take part in genocide ? @entity2 : what do you mean did you take part in genocide ? that is a false allegation			0
@entity215 : is it a false allegation ? [ @entity10 gets out of car			0
] @entity2 : boss ... i think that you are talking to the wrong person			2
@entity215 : am i ? @entity2 : definitely yes ... so what i will do now , i am calling the police because definitely you are assaulting me			1
] you are an animal ... you think because you are a white man you can just abuse me ? @entity215 : no i 'm not , i 'm asking you a question			1
@entity2 : i do n't know you , i do n't know you , sir			0
i 'm calling the police			2
@entity10 then called the police on his mobile phone			2
he told them : ' police police police please ... someone is assaulting me			1
my name is @entity2 and i 'm being assaulted by someone			0
i 'm just by @entity275 hotel			0
just by @entity277 station ... because he 's making false allegations ... i 'm just doing my job working , i 'm a taxi driver , and someone came up and started abusing me ... he 's a white man ... i need the police to come out			1
i need the police around here please			2
he 's calling me names , he 's calling me a criminal , he 's calling me a murderer , and as far as i know i 'm innocent ... he 's got a mission ... he just came out of the blue			1
he 's just full of racist [ inaudible ] he 's a racist guy calling himself a journalist			2
calling me a n * * * * *			0
he 's a racist man ... that 's what i 'm suffering here ... racist , all those of things			1

when @entity213 approaches @entity299 leader , he accuses us of racist abuse and spitting , calls police ... then gets £ 80 spot fine for wasting their time
@entity93 believes he is a war criminal - but he ca *n’t* be sent home because trial would breach his human rights
