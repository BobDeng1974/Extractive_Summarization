the father of @entity1 is seen here for the first time without the long beard and ponytail he grew while his son was held by the @entity7 for five years before his controversial release			1
@entity9 , 55 , raised a few eyebrows when he stood next to president @entity11 during his announcement of @entity1 's release at a @entity15 press conference at the end of may			1
but today – more than six weeks after his son 's release - @entity17 was clean - shaven as he left a bike repair shop where he works in his hometown of @entity21 , @entity22			1
but @entity17 's new look ca n't mask an apparent family rift			1
astonishingly , it emerged that @entity1 has refused to speak with his parents since he was released from captivity in @entity40 six weeks ago			1
and today the pow 's lawyer refused to say whether he had any plans to return to his hometown			2
an army official reportedly told the @entity46 that the sergeant has refused to see his parents in person or even speak to them on the phone , suggesting ' a deeper estrangement between the soldier and his parents than the military understood when he was released '			2
the precise cause of the estrangement is n't known , but if true it must come as a bitter blow to @entity17 who dedicated his life to bringing @entity27 home			1
@entity17 had been growing the facial hair ever since his son was kidnapped by @entity7 warlords in @entity60 in 2009			1
@entity17 – who dedicated his life to finding @entity27 – vowed not to shave until his son returned home safely and the beard became a symbol of his quest			1
sgt @entity1 had been held captive by the @entity64 for five years before he was released to @entity65 in may as part of a prisoner swap			1
under that deal , @entity1 was set free in exchange for the release of five @entity7 detainees at @entity72			1
the @entity15 quickly hailed @entity1 's release as a victory but the matter soon became embroiled in controversy as lawmakers complained they were n't given sufficient notice of the planned swap and warned of national security risks of releasing leading @entity7 figures			1
to add to the fallout several former members of @entity1 's platoon branded him a deserter and a traitor and said other soldiers had given their lives trying to rescue them			2
support : @entity9 grew his beard and hair long during the five years his son spent in captivity and appeared at the @entity15 when @entity93 's release was announced deserter ? @entity1 now faces an @entity95 investigation into the circumstances that led to him being taken captive @entity1 now faces a military investigation into the circumstances that led to him being taken captive			1

he learned the @entity107 language , read in to the history of the @entity7 and grew his beard in order to better communicate with them			2
' @entity27 has been gone so long , it ’s going to be very difficult to come back , ' he warned a few days after his son ’s release			2
' if he comes up too fast , it could kill him			0
' it was widely assumed that they would reunite after he returned to the @entity118 and @entity1 would be welcomed home to @entity21 amid fanfare and open arms			2
@entity1 returned to a ' desk job ' at @entity123 this week and continues to live in army barracks in @entity104			0

@entity126 said he has met with the sergeant and hopes to ‘ facilitate ’ the next chapter of his life			0
' we had extensive conversations last week , ' he told @entity150			1

he ’s got to move in to the next chapter and pursue his education and put @entity60 behind him			0
' he wants to pursue an education and be normal , another citizen in the crowd			0
' he does n’t know what course he wants to do yet but that ’s his plan			0
@entity27 is just really looking forward to putting this behind him			0
' @entity126 told @entity150 that he does n’t know whether @entity1 intends to return to his hometown of @entity21 , @entity22 and wo n’t be drawn on his relationship with his parents and why it appears he has n’t spoken to them yet			1
@entity126 said major general @entity171 , who is heading the investigation into the circumstances surrounding @entity1 's disappearance from his outpost in @entity60 , had not yet interviewed his client			2
he said he did n't expect @entity171 to have any substantive interviews with @entity1 for a couple of weeks			2

mind games : this photo of @entity1 smiling with @entity7 commander @entity204 was posted on @entity205 recently and raised more questions about his time in captivity when he was swapped for five @entity72 detainees on may 31 , @entity11 said the switch had been prompted by @entity1 's poor health			1
but his former comrades have insisted he abandoned his post - putting others in danger - and last week , on a @entity205 account associated with the @entity217 of @entity60 , a user said @entity1 had been treated with kindness by his captors			2
@entity150 yesterday approached @entity17 in @entity21 but he refused to comment			1
he appeared down and gloomy and hid in the back of the business where he works repairing bikes			0
