@entity1 chairman @entity0 passed up the opportunity to sign @entity3 for just £ 750,000 in 2009 as his age ' did n't represent good value for money '			1
the @entity6 international was a target for @entity1 in 2008 - 09 before he joined @entity9 from @entity10 , which led to a £ 4million return to his boyhood club @entity12 this summer			2
although the 32 - year - old is almost certain to be part of @entity6 's @entity18 squad , @entity0 decided not to pursue the club 's interest in @entity3 at the time			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity3 's first interview as a @entity12 player no regrets ? @entity1 turned down the chance to sign @entity3 for just £ 750,000 in 2009 oops ! @entity26 did n't sign @entity3 from @entity10 because he was n't ' good value for money ' speaking to the @entity28 on july 7 , 2009 , @entity0 said : ' a move for @entity3 is a no - no. ' no disrespect to a very good player , but it ’s a simple matter of economics			1
any deal would cost a minimum of £ 750,000 plus add - ons for a player who is 27 and who would want a three - year contract			0
' even if he scored 30 goals a season for those three years , by the time the contract is at an end , the player would be 30 , and therefore there would be little or no resale value			0
red alert ! @entity3 has since completed a £ 4million move to his boyhood club @entity12 ' that means that even before meeting wage demands , the signing would cost £ 5,000 a week , and this club can not do that kind of business			0
' if @entity3 was 22 or 23 , it would be a different matter , but he ’s not and suggestions that we will sign him are nonsense			0
' the @entity1 chairman may regret those words after seeing @entity3 complete his dream move to @entity12 where he will be challenging for the @entity64 title while playing in the @entity66 next season .			2

@entity1 could have signed @entity3 for £ 750,000 in 2009
chairman @entity0 passed up the chance because he did not believe @entity3 represented ' good value for money '
the 32 - year - old has since scored goals in the @entity64 for @entity9 before completing a dream £ 4m move to @entity12
@entity3 is *expected* to be *included* in @entity6 's final @entity18 squad
