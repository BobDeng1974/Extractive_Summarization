electric cars may help cut down on fossil fuel use , but their limited range has so far been their downfall			0
now , @entity4 believes it has come up with a solution by using street lighting to charge up cars while they 're parked , allowing them to run for longer			1
the @entity10 car manufacturer said it will run a pilot project in @entity12 next year that uses existing local authority lighting networks to power their vehicles			1
@entity4 has made two prototype ' @entity15 and @entity18 ' street lights , which combine @entity19 ( @entity19 ) with the company 's @entity21 recharging stations			1

' seamless charging infrastructure is essential if we want to see more electric vehicles on the road in our cities in the future , ' @entity28 , member of the board of management of @entity4 , said			2
the @entity12 pilot will install the first charging lights , which can be grafted straight onto the existing local authority street lighting infrastructure , @entity4 said			1
these additional charging stations can be used by as many drivers as possible , regardless of vehicle model and electricity provider			2
two street lights ( artist 's impression left ) are already installed in front of the @entity4 headquarters ( right ) and drivers can pay to charge their cars via a mobile phone app two street lights are already installed in front of the @entity4 headquarters and drivers can pay to charge their cars via a mobile phone app. the company has already developed some of the most advanced electric cars , including the i3 city vehicle and i8 hybrid			1
but electric cars have struggled to gain widespread popularity due to their limited operating range , the scarcity of charging stations and the time it takes to recharge them			2
motorways are to become ‘ electric superhighways ’ in an attempt to persuade drivers to switch to battery - powered cars			0
‘ @entity79 stations ’ are to be installed on several major roads by the end of the year , enabling electric cars to travel across the country in one trip for the first time			2
billionaire entrepreneur @entity80 is fitting the devices , which can charge the @entity83 electric cars his company makes , in 20 minutes , giving a range of 130 miles ( 209km )			2
this is significantly faster than most current electric cars , which often require overnight charging and have a range of under 100 miles ( 160km )			0
it means electric car owners will be able to drive large distances across @entity92 without concerns about running out of power , known as ‘ range anxiety ’			0
the first network will stretch from @entity97 to @entity98 along the @entity99 , cover the entire @entity100 and follow the @entity101 from @entity98 to @entity102 and the @entity103 and @entity104 to @entity105 via @entity106			0
@entity83 declined to say which service stations would be used , but installation work was reported to be almost complete on the @entity110 services at the junction of the @entity100 and the @entity112 in @entity113			0
in addition to developing street lighting , @entity4 has already invested in software and applications that aim to help drivers of electric cars find parking spaces and charging stations			1
the group also recently met with rival @entity83 to discuss the availability of electric vehicle charging stations			0
in september , @entity125 said it had bought my taxi and @entity128 , two smartphone applications that will help the maker of @entity132 limousines provide services to people who do not own cars			0
