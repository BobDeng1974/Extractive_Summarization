published : 11:15 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 08:43 est , 20 february 2013 these pictures show the incredible evolution of the food eaten by astronauts as they explored the cosmos over the past 50 years			1
@entity5 has released the images , which show the transition from the meat paste @entity9 , the first man in space , sucked from a toothpaste tube to the gourmet meals astronauts currently enjoy			1
the pictures were posted on the space agency 's website by @entity5 's @entity16 , where the agency researches , tests , and produces food fit for consumption outside of the @entity22 's atmosphere			1
pictured is a tray of food eaten on the @entity32 , @entity34 's first space station , from 1973 - 1974 appetizing : food from the @entity37 missions from 1968 - 1972 was carefully vacuum - packed and balanced for nutrition but was not exactly gourmet reheating : these packages of thermostabilised foods such as cheddar cheese spread and even hot - dogs are heated to destroy pathogens , microorganisms and enzymes that may make it go off for over 50 years , the methods involved in the preservation process have evolved			1
astronauts have gone from eating seed and crackers to home - cooked style dishes including shrimp , @entity56 rice for a ' paella in space ' dish and even ice cream			1
nutrition in space is incredibly complicated			2
everything from the packaging to the menu has to be meticulously evaluated as the food must balance nutrition , flavour , and safety with more practical concerns such as preparation time , size , and shelf life			2
high tea : the @entity76 space shuttle 's @entity74 eating on board the @entity78 eighties food : shuttle 're - hydratables ' used from 1981 - 1989			1
food is sucked clear of all water and must be placed into hot water and ' rehydrated ' before consumption colourful : now food is freeze - dried and maintains its resemblance to the shrimp , paella and beef jerky but fruit and vegetables can also be taken and stored at room temperature weightlessness affects almost every system in the body , including those of the bones , muscles , heart and blood vessels , and nerves			1
the top priority is to ensure that the astronauts get the proper amount of nutrients , calories and minerals to maintain their physical health and performance for the life of the mission			2
calorie requirements differ for astronauts			2
for instance , a small woman would require only about 1,900 calories a day , while a large man would require about 3,200 calories - about 800 more than on @entity22			2
to complicate matters , spaceflight nutritional requirements are influenced by many of the physiological changes that occur during spaceflight			0
also , the lack of gravity means smell - and taste - is impaired			0
foods are either partially or completely dehydrated to prevent them from spoiling			0
meats are exposed to radiation before they are put onboard the shuttle to give them a longer shelf life			0
meals are organized by the order in which astronauts are going to eat them , and stored in locker trays held by a net so they wo n't float away			1
they heat foods in a forced - air convection oven that 's kept between 160 and 170 degrees @entity144			0
it takes about 20 to 30 minutes to rehydrate and heat an average meal			0
aside from keeping the astronauts ' bellies full , food plays another vital role - keeping up morale			1
according to @entity5 , it ' not only provides nutrition for astronauts , but also enhances the psychological well - being of the crew by establishing a familiar element in an unfamiliar and hostile environment '			2
studies have shown that eating certain foods - such as meatloaf and mashed potatoes or turkey on @entity164 - improve people 's mood and give them satisfaction			0
before food is approved , astronauts make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final ok on @entity22 before it blasts off			1
and research into the next generation of space food is currently underway , as humanity turns its gaze towards @entity176			1
it might be the case that astronauts will grow their own food aboard the vessel as it hurtles towards the red plant			2
it is estimated that any manned mission to @entity176 will take three years , meaning thousands of meals must be provided			1
a statement from the @entity16 said : ' the current crew member diet is completely supplied through prepackaged , shelf - stable food items produced on @entity22			0
' the duration of future missions may require a portion of the diet to be grown , processed , and prepared in the space habitat			0
' as other nations enter the space race , the variety of cuisine has widened considerably			0
on @entity198 's first manned space flight , astronaut @entity196 ate yuxiang pork , kung pao chicken , and eight treasures rice , along with @entity203 herbal tea			0
@entity205 â€™s first astronaut , @entity204 , was a crew member on the @entity78 and brought a special version of @entity205 's national dish , kimchi			0
it took three research institutes several years and millions of dollars to create a version of the fermented cabbage dish that was suitable for space travel			1
basic : foods eaten on the @entity216 and @entity217 missions from 1961 - 1966 including fruit cake and chicken sandwiches ( centre ) no ordinary lunch box : @entity78 food containers packed with sachets of dinner flavours : now a wide selection of drinks is available to astronauts including tea with lemon , @entity232 coffee , hot chocolate and a selection of fruit juices the first man in space @entity9 ate pureed meat from toothpaste tubes as he orbited the @entity22 in 1961			1
when @entity34 followed the @entity241 into space they quickly developed freeze dried foods for the @entity245 missions			0
however astronauts found the offerings unappetising and hard to rehydrate			0
by the time of the @entity217 missions from 1965 - 6 the flavours had improved and the menu included shrimp cocktail , chicken and vegetables and butterscotch pudding			0
astronauts now make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final ok on @entity22 before it blasts off .			2

pictures show 50 years of the food that astronauts eat in space
astronauts now enjoy shrimp , soup and even fresh salad
research is underway into the food that could one day be eaten on @entity176
