by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 faced a new @entity4 revolt last night after a second conservative mp admitted he has secretly asked for a vote aimed at sacking him as leader			1
anti-gay marriage mp @entity9 confirmed to @entity11 that he has written to party chiefs calling for a vote of ' no confidence ' in mr @entity2			1
it is believed that as many as 25 of the 46 @entity4 mps needed to trigger a vote on the prime minister 's future have now sent letters to senior backbencher @entity21 , chairman of the @entity22			2
revolt : @entity9 has launched a bid to oust prime minister @entity2 businessman mr @entity9 , mp for @entity25 , said the @entity26 could lose the next election unless mr @entity2 was replaced			1
' there is a credibility problem with the current leader , ' he said			2
' it 's like being in an aeroplane			2
the pilot does n't know how to land it			2
we can either do something about it			2
or sit back , watch the in - flight movies and wait for the inevitable			0
' mr @entity9 , 48 , refused to say who he believed should replace mr @entity2			1
but he is known to be close to @entity4 mp @entity40 , who , as @entity11 revealed earlier this year , has been linked to a conservative leadership plot			0
ambitious mr @entity40 denies he is trying to bring down mr @entity2 , but is seen by some conservatives as a potential future leader			1
mr @entity9 enraged @entity44 last week after he wrote a letter signed by 80 @entity4 mps challenging mr @entity2 's policy on the civil war in @entity49			1
amid reports that the prime minister is about to supply arms to @entity49 rebels , mr @entity9 and his supporters delivered a letter to no 10 demanding the right for mps to have the final say on the issue , not mr @entity2			1
in trouble ? @entity2 could be set to face a ' vote of no confidence ' in his leadership from party members no 10 saw it as an attack on mr @entity2			1
' @entity9 has shown little interest in foreign affairs before			1
this was a feeble excuse to have a go at the pm , ' said a @entity2 supporter			1
the letter was sent to @entity75 last week by mr @entity9 and co-author , fellow right - wing @entity79 mp @entity78 , who led the @entity82 revolt against the @entity83 over a referendum on the @entity86 's membership of the @entity87			1
mr @entity9 's stand against mr @entity2 emerged as a poll commissioned by @entity4 peer lord @entity90 showed that , for the first time , mr @entity2 's ratings are lagging behind those of his party			1
mr @entity9 has voiced doubts about mr @entity2 privately for some time , but the gay marriage issue was the last straw			1
he wrote to mr @entity21 calling for a vote of no confidence in mr @entity2 as the legislation was being debated in the @entity101 last month			1
mr @entity2 's allies last night dismissed mr @entity9 's demand for a ' no confidence ' vote as ' irrelevant '			1
one said : ' the vast majority of conservative mps are solidly behind the pm			0
there are always one or two mavericks who are out to cause trouble			0
the only other mp to write such a letter did n't fare too well			0
' this comment was a sarcastic reference to @entity116 who , as revealed by this newspaper in 2011 , was the first @entity4 mp to be identified as having called for a vote of no confidence in mr @entity2			1
he was forced to resign the @entity4 whip a week ago after the @entity121 claimed he had broken the rules on lobbying by @entity107			0
it means his ' no confidence ' letter is invalid			2
nevertheless , mr @entity9 's protest letter demanding a vote on @entity49 produced almost immediate success , with ministers promising there would be a vote by @entity107			2
by @entity9 vocal : @entity4 @entity40 has already called on the party to prepare to oust @entity2 i did not seek to make my name public , but since i have been asked to confirm that i have called for a no confidence vote in the prime minister , i think it is wrong to deny it			1
i informed the @entity4 whips office in advance that i was putting in my letter of no confidence			2
it is with regret that i have called for such a vote			0
i have come to the view that although many of our policies are right , whether on welfare reform or reducing the deficit , there is a credibility problem with the current leader			0
the voters think we have many of the right messages â € “ they just do n't believe the messenger			0
in some cases , the messages are wrong or badly handled			0
by pressing ahead with gay marriage and delaying a promise on an @entity87 referendum until he was forced to do so , mr @entity2 has fuelled the rise of @entity167			1
we have created our own nemesis			0
i believe the prime minister has blundered by forcing through the gay marriage vote			0
this was something we did not have to do			0
the @entity116 marched us on to the guns over this and it has cost us a lot of support			0
i know no 10 denied that anyone close to the prime minister regarded ordinary party members as ' swivel - eyed loons ' , but i am afraid that some people at the top of the party do perceive @entity4 grassroots activists in this way			2
there are questions over the style of leadership we have had in the past few years			0
in my view , loyalty has to run in both directions â € “ from the bottom to the top and the top to the bottom			0
people will ask whether now is the wrong time to consider a change of leader			0
but i think the situation is this : it 's like being in an aeroplane			0
the pilot does n't know how to land it			0
we can either do something about it before the crash , or sit back , watch the in - flight movies and wait for the inevitable			0
calm down : @entity2 has fuelled the rise of of @entity167 according to @entity9			1

@entity9 calls on party to ' no confidence ' @entity2
' we could lose the next election with @entity2 in charge ' he says
@entity2 *blamed* for fuelling the rise of @entity167
