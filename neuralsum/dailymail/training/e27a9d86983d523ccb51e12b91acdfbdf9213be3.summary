a historic mess ? a 2,400 - year - old coffin bearing unusual and amateurish decorations , may reveal the decline of @entity3 , one expert claims			1
it has strange features such as ‘ goofy ’ jars and unusual funeral bed with a bird 's head ( pictured ) painted on it among other mistakes from 525 bc for around a century , the @entity14 ruled @entity3 after @entity26 marched into the @entity13 capital , @entity28 , toppling the pharaoh			1
the occupation meant that the @entity31 stretched from what is now @entity33 to @entity34			0
the coffin could shed light on a tumultuous time in @entity13 history , in which ancient texts by @entity40 suggest the occupying @entity42 deported @entity3 ’s best craftsmen and artists to work on its own grand projects in @entity46 – as well as taking precious metals too			1
this drain of talent may explain the badly - painted coffin , according to @entity51 , of @entity53 's @entity52			1
‘ many of the best artists in @entity3 were taken by the @entity14 back to @entity58 and @entity59 as prisoners of war and war booty — you can see their work in those places , ’ she told @entity55			1
from 525 bc for around a century , the @entity14 ruled @entity3 after @entity26 marched into the @entity13 capital , @entity28 , defeating pharaoh @entity66 ( illustrated in this 19th century painting ) the occupation of @entity3 , which began in 525 @entity69 , meant that the @entity31 stretched from what is now @entity33 to @entity34 ( pictured ) @entity71 expanded the @entity31 by defeating the @entity13 pharaoh @entity66 during the battle of @entity74 in 525 bc. the @entity13 army was defeated and shortly afterwards , @entity28 was taken			1
the captive pharaoh was executed , having attempted a rebellion and @entity13 inscriptions show that @entity71 officially adopted the titles and costumes of the pharaohs			2
during his reign , @entity13 master craftsmen were deported so they could build elaborate palaces and other buildings in @entity46			1
consequently , the quality of art suffered in @entity3 , as evidenced by the coffin			2
@entity71 went on to invade the @entity90 ( which is now the @entity91 ) but with little success			0
he died in disputed circumstances , either by his own hand , an accident or even assassination			0
the location of his tomb is even uncertain			0
‘ there seems to have been a dearth of masters for some time , so that fewer and fewer artists got proper training			2
’ a lack of training might explain the strange features on the coffin , such as the funeral bed having the head of a human - headed bird named @entity111			1
@entity111 is almost always depicted as a human - headed falcon and is often seen hovering over the deceased 's mummy or freely entering and leaving a tomb , signifying an individual 's soul , or spirit			0
she told the @entity119 last month that this is the only coffin she has come across with a bed featuring @entity111 ’s head			2
she also said that a winged snake wearing a crown that is associated with the goddess @entity126 - of joy and motherhood - is ‘ very odd , ’ while four jars in the scene have a ‘ goofy ’ appearance			0
dr @entity51 explained that the artist ’s lack of skill is particularly apparent when considering two creatures that look a little bit like fish , which are meant to be falcons – a symbol of the god @entity140			0
according to inscriptions on the coffin , it belonged to a woman named @entity145 , or @entity146 - ast , who radiocarbon dating suggests lived while @entity3 was under @entity31 control			2
@entity31 king , @entity149 , who was born in 550 @entity69 , reportedly bragged that skilled @entity13 artists , carpenters and goldsmiths decorated his palace at @entity59			0
experts have questioned whether the coffin is real , because of its unusual markings			2
but radiocarbon dating has confirmed its authenticity and its material – sycamore wood – was used during this time for crafting coffins			0
the distinctive ‘ @entity13 blue ’ pigment also points to the artefact not being fake			0
dr @entity51 said : ‘ i think there is really no doubt that this one is genuine			0
the coffin could shed light on a tumultuous time in @entity13 history , in which ancient texts suggest the occupying @entity42 deported @entity3 ’s best craftsmen and artists , to work on its own grand projects in @entity46 , instead of grand projects in the country 's capital , @entity28			1
the head of a sphinx in @entity28 is shown			0

an egyptologist from @entity53 's @entity52 believes the strange coffin markings were made by junior artists shortly after 525 bc
this is because master craftsmen were deported by the @entity14 who *conquered* @entity3 , using them to build *magnificent* buildings at home
the coffin features a ' one of a kind ' death bed with a bird 's head
' @entity200 ' jars and *botched* patterns also show it was painted by amateurs
