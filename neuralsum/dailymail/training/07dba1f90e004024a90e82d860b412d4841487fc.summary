by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 01:39 est , 20 august 2013 ' @entity1 ' : @entity2 , of @entity3 , @entity4 , who died of cancer aged 78 in february , stood up to @entity6 over the pricing issue @entity6 has been fined £ 300,000 in a landmark court case after it misled thousands of shoppers with a bogus half - price strawberry promotion			1
the supermarket admitted four offences linked to the sale of punnets of strawberries in 2,300 stores across the country at a ‘ half - price ’ figure of £ 1.99			1
@entity20 ’s biggest grocer used an original price of £ 3.99 to justify the bargain claim			2
however , this higher figure only applied for a very short period			0
@entity6 has admitted the claims of big savings were misleading and it has now been fined £ 300,000 and ordered to pay £ 65,000 in costs			1
the ruling will serve as a warning to all supermarkets , who stand accused of using a raft of underhand tactics to tempt shoppers through the doors			0
@entity37 @entity36 heard that the half - price promotion was instrumental in generating strawberry sales of some £ 52million with a profit of £ 2.3million			1
judge @entity41 said : ‘ the promotion was not a genuine bargain			0
it was false and misleading			0
the offer should never have been made in the first place by a national retailer			0
’ he said the case was ‘ shocking by its very nature ’ because consumers had a ‘ high degree of trust ’ in chains such as @entity6			1
as a result , he decided to levy what is a very large fine in terms of trading standards law			0
in court : supermarket giant @entity6 has been fined £ 300,000 for misleading the public over a half - price offer on punnets of strawberries the case only reached the courts thanks to the tenacity of elderly shopper @entity2 , who saw the strawberry bargain claims when in a @entity6 at @entity68 , @entity37 , in the summer of 2011			1
it turned out that the £ 3.99 figure had applied for a very short period , however the half - price deal ran for a much longer 14 weeks through the summer			1
this was at odds with guidelines in the @entity76			0
a general rule of thumb is that an offer price should not carry on for a longer period than an item was sold at its full price			0
fined : the case concerned a @entity6 store in @entity68 , @entity37 , after it was brought to trading standards officials ' attention mrs @entity2 understood that the original price of £ 3.99 might have been fair at the start of the strawberry season when the fruit was still in short supply			1
praise : @entity2 's friend @entity93 ( pictured ) , 79 , said the late campaigner ' would be pleased to know something had been done ' however , she knew it was unfair to keep using this high figure when strawberries were plentiful and farmers were supplying them at low prices			2
it is exactly this tactic that all of the supermarkets have used for years to give the impression they are offering bargains on seasonal fruit and vegetables			0
mrs @entity2 was identified in court as making the complaint , however , she died earlier this year , aged 78 , before the case was resolved			1
she took up the matter with her local trading standards office which pursued the case to the point that @entity6 felt it had no choice but to admit misleading shoppers			2
@entity37 council ’s head of trading standards , @entity119 , stressed the ruling was significant for the way products were promoted in future			2
‘ food pricing , presentation and the depiction of promotional practices is a crucial issue for retailers , and in turn , consumers			0
’ @entity6 had tried to kill off the prosecution earlier this year by arguing that @entity37 council did not have the power to pursue a case involving offences outside its borders			1
yesterday , however the store admitted its guilt , although it insisted the misleading promotion was the result of a one - off human error , rather than a wider attempt to deceive customers			2
a store spokesman said : ‘ we sell over 40,000 products in our stores , with thousands on promotion at any one time , but even one mistake is one too many .			0
