an anonymous @entity1 official 's reported description of prime minister @entity3 as a ' chicken * * * t ' , or worthless coward , drew a sharp response on wednesday from the @entity8 leader – no stranger to acrimony with the @entity12 administration – and a slam from @entity1 's @entity14 house speaker			1
the @entity1 broadside , in an interview in the @entity16 , followed a month of heated exchanges between the @entity3 government and @entity20 over settlement - building in @entity8 - annexed @entity22 , which @entity23 seek as the capital of a future state in the @entity26 and @entity27			1
the @entity28 soft - pedaled the insult as ' counterproductive ' but offered no apology and did n't identify the official involved			1
' the thing about @entity3 is , he 's a chicken * * * t , ' the unidentified official was quoted as saying , using @entity3 's nickname and a slang insult certain to redden the ears of the @entity1 - educated former commando			1
' the assault on me comes only because i defend the @entity8 , ' @entity8 pm @entity3 said after an unnamed @entity12 administration official called him a ' chicken * * * t ' in a conversation with a reporter otherwise occupied : @entity12 ducked mention of the controversy by spending his day focused on @entity47 – meeting with doctors and nurses in an orchestrated photo - op ' the good thing about @entity3 is that he 's scared to launch wars , ' the official said , alluding to past hints of possible @entity8 military action against @entity58 's nuclear program			1
' the bad thing about him is that he wo n't do anything to reach an accommodation with the @entity23 or with the @entity63			0
' @entity3 , the official was reported to have said , is interested only in ' protecting himself from political defeat ... he 's got no guts			1
' @entity8 leaders usually do not respond to comments by unidentified officials			2
but @entity3 addressed those remarks directly in opening a memorial ceremony in parliament for an @entity8 cabinet minister assassinated by a @entity23 in 2001			1
' i am not prepared to make concessions that will endanger our state , ' @entity3 said			2
' understand , our national interests , topped by security and the unity of @entity22 , are not what top the interests of those anonymous forces attacking us , and me personally			0
' ' i am under attack simply because i am defending the @entity8			2
if i did n't stand firm on our national interests , i would not be under attack			0
' ' our supreme interests , chiefly the security and unity of @entity22 , are not the main concern of those anonymous officials who attack us and me personally , as the assault on me comes only because i defend the @entity8 , ' the @entity8 prime minister added			1
' despite all of the attacks i suffer , i will continue to defend our country			0
i will continue to defend the citizens of @entity8 , ' he said			2
such pledges by @entity3 have resonated among @entity8 voters , even amid fears his strained relations with @entity1 president @entity12 could ultimately weaken support from @entity8 's main diplomatic ally and arms provider			1
after @entity3 's speech , @entity104 , a spokesman for the @entity105 , dismissed the purported slur , denying that it reflected how the @entity12 administration felt about the @entity8 leader			1
' certainly that 's not the administration 's view , and we think such comments are inappropriate and counterproductive			2
' the same word – ' counterproductive – was on @entity28 press secretary @entity118 's crib sheet during a wednesday briefing with reporters			1
' those comments do not reflect the @entity1 ' position , and they do not reflect the personal views of the @entity124 , ' @entity118 said			0
' i am not aware of who made those comments ...			0
i am not aware if the president knows who made those comments			0
i 'd be surprised if he did			0
' @entity28 press secretary @entity118 said wednesday that the president does n't know who called the @entity8 prime minister a vulgar name , but that it was ' counterproductive ' confronted with harsh criticism from @entity138 , the speaker of the @entity139 , @entity118 called it ' a little rich to have a lecture about profanity from the @entity138			1
' referring to the epithet ' chicken * * * t , ' he claimed that @entity138 has ' reportedly said that about the majority leader of the @entity147 , ' democrat @entity148 of @entity149			2
the speaker had hours earlier called it a ' failure ' of @entity12 's leadership that ' disrespectful rhetoric ' has been ' used time and again by this administration with respect to the special relationship the @entity1 has with the state of @entity8			1
' ' when the president discusses @entity8 and @entity58 , it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is @entity1 ’s friend and who he thinks is @entity1 ’s enemy , ' @entity138 said in a statement			1
' @entity167 has no trouble drawing that distinction			0
' ' over the last several months , i have watched the administration insult ally after ally			0
i am tired of the administration ’s apology tour			2
the president sets the tone for his administration			0
he either condones the profanity and disrespect used by the most senior members of his administration , or he does not			1
' @entity138 's statement referred specifically to the use of vulgar language as a slam against a head of state , not the use of foul language in general			2
some @entity8 pundits predict an @entity8 election in 2015 , two years early , speculation seemingly supported by increasingly vocal challenges to his policies from senior ministers to the left and right of him within the coalition government			2
economy minister @entity200 , whose ultranationalist @entity201 belongs to the coalition but who has had testy relations with @entity3 , defended him on wednesday			2
' the prime minister of israel is not a private person			1
he is the leader of the jewish state and the entire @entity201 people			0
cursing the prime minister and calling him names is an insult not just to him but to the millions of @entity8 citizens and @entity213 across the globe , ' he wrote on @entity215			1
@entity8 opposition leader @entity216 sounded a more critical note , telling @entity218 television : ' @entity3 is acting like a political pyromaniac , and he has brought our relations with the @entity1 to an unprecedented low			1
' in a series of recent speeches widely seen in @entity8 as setting the stage for a possible poll , @entity3 has highlighted growing security concerns in the wake of the july - august war with @entity230 in @entity27 and regional unrest that has brought @entity233 militants to @entity8 's northern border with @entity235			1
@entity8 also worries that @entity1 - led world powers will agree to what it deems insufficient curbs on the nuclear programme of its arch - foe , @entity58 , in talks with a looming nov 24 deadline			0
fears of a possible new @entity245 , or uprising , have been stoked in @entity8 by now - daily rock - throwing by @entity23 in @entity22 amid @entity249 fears of an end to an @entity8 de facto ban on @entity201 worship at the @entity254 compound in the holy city where @entity257 temples once stood			0
@entity3 has pledged to preserve the ' status quo ' at the site , a commitment @entity23 leaders view with suspicion			0
but drawing @entity23 outrage and a @entity264 accusation that @entity8 was distancing peace , @entity3 pledged on monday to fast - track plans for 1,000 new settler homes in @entity8 - annexed @entity22			1
@entity3 described such criticism as being ' detached from reality ' , saying @entity213 had a right to live anywhere in @entity22 , regarded by @entity8 as its united capital - a claim not internationally recognised			1
@entity104 , the @entity1 spokesman , acknowledged longstanding policy differences between @entity8 and @entity20 over settlements			0
' obviously , despite the extremely close relationship between the @entity1 and @entity8 , we do not agree on every issue , ' he said			0
' for instance we have repeatedly made clear the @entity1 ' longstanding view that settlement activity is illegitimate and complicates efforts to achieve a two - state solution			0
' despite these differences ' the @entity1 - @entity8 relationship remains as strong as ever ' , @entity104 added			0
most countries and the @entity288 deem the settlements @entity8 has built in areas captured in a 1967 war to be illegal			0
@entity8 disputes this , and has settled 500,000 @entity213 in @entity22 and the @entity26 , among 2.4 million @entity23			0
