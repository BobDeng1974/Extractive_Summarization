by @entity0 a distraught pet owner has told how her dog died after she became overheated during a grooming session at @entity4			1
@entity5 took her dog @entity6 to @entity4 in @entity8 , @entity9 , last saturday			1
the dog , a six - year - old @entity10 had been groomed at that branch for several years , but when she arrived @entity5 was told that her dog 's usual groomer was away on holiday			1
owner : @entity5 , a dog lover took her pet @entity6 to @entity4 in @entity8 for routine grooming last week dog : @entity6 was a 6 - year - old @entity10 loved by @entity5 and the rest of her family @entity5 said when she found out that a new groomer had to carry out the appointment she conducted a short interview to make sure that her dog @entity6 would be in good hands			1
however , just four and a half hours later , @entity4 staff told @entity5 to take her dog to an emergency vet			1
@entity5 said that when she picked up her dog , @entity6 was drooling profusely and could not walk			1
by the time that she got @entity6 to the vet , her body temperature had spiked to 109 degrees			2
a normal body temperature for a dog is 102 degrees @entity35			0
the vet said that overheating was causing @entity6 's organs to shut down			2
the next day her beloved dog died			1
@entity5 told @entity40 : ‘ it should n’t happen to anybody who loves their dogs or cats			2
’ ‘ you take a perfectly healthy dog in whose tail is waggling and she is kissing everybody in the butt like she always does and you bring out a dog who is suffering and dying and there ’s no excuse			0
@entity4 : four and a half hours after @entity6 was dropped off at @entity4 , staff told @entity5 to take the dog to the emergency vet in happier times : sadly a vet told @entity5 her dog 's temperature had spiked to 109 degrees and she died a day later @entity4 staff told @entity5 that it was very hot in the back room where the dogs were kept			1
in a statement , @entity4 said : ‘ the safety and well - being of the pets in our care is our top priority			0
‘ we are conducting a full investigation into this incident and will take appropriate action based on our findings			0
’ @entity5 said she instructed the groomer not to dry @entity6 and does n't know if a heated blow dryer was used but @entity6 was completely dry			2
she said that the store manager told her the company would pay for her vet bills , which cost more than $ 2,200			0
the company 's corporate office has been in touch with her also and sent flowers			0
newfoundlands are known to be heat sensitive ; something @entity5 would have expected a dog groomer to know			0
she is considering her options at this point but hopes all groomers change their policies and make sure the back rooms are kept cool and dogs are monitored for heat issues .			0
