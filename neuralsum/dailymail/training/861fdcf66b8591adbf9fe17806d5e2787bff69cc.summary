by @entity1 reporter published : 15:30 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 21:12 est , 12 june 2013 the support team for @entity4 endurance swimmer @entity3 says she has ended her attempt to swim from @entity6 to @entity7			1
a news release wednesday night says the swim ended after 11 hours due to a ' debilitating ' jelly fish sting			1
she was trying to become the first person to swim across the @entity13 nonstop without a shark cage			2
she was smiling , upbeat and had arrived in the morning at a rocky jetty in @entity24 's @entity27 in a pink 1950s @entity29 convertible			2
she carefully adjusted her black swim cap and goggles while her husband applied grease around the edges of her suit to prevent chafing			2
@entity3 had expected to spend about 60 hours in the sea before reaching the @entity38 , a little more than 100 miles to the northeast ' as confident as i can be			1
i think it 's all going to work out well , ' the 28 - year - old said at the time			2
' it 'll be tough , though			0
it 's not going to be an easy ride , but we 'll get through it as a team			2
' @entity3 had planned to take about 60 hours to get to the @entity38 , a little more than 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) to the northeast , braving sharks and jellyfish along the way			1
the current weather report for that window is clear			0
the sea off @entity24 was flat and glassy wednesday , precisely the ideal conditions that @entity3 's science team had forecast			1
@entity4 swimmer @entity3 adjusts her earplugs as her husband applies grease around the edges of her suit to prevent chafing the @entity13 has been busy the last three summers , with fellow marathon swimmers @entity63 and @entity65 making four failed attempts at the crossing between them since 2011			1
@entity4 @entity69 successfully made the swim in 1997 , though she did it with the benefit of a shark cage			2
' it is the hardest swim in the world today , ' @entity3 said earlier at a news conference in the @entity6 capital			1
' no one has been able to achieve this			0
it 's possibly harder than winning the @entity81 or getting a gold medal			0
' the challenge also outstrips by far , at least in terms of distance , anything she 's done before			0
@entity3 , who has twice made a double crossing of the @entity89 , said the most time she 's spent in the water continuously is 25 hours			1
she is swimming under @entity92 rules , which means she can not touch her support boat or hold onto anything			0
nor can she wear a full - body wetsuit , which would help protect against exposure and jellyfish stings , or use a shark cage			0
this is the moment @entity3 jumped into the water at @entity27 to start her swim to @entity7 from @entity24 , @entity6 @entity3 puts on her goggles as she prepares to jump into the water and start her swim to @entity7 from @entity24 , @entity6 a piece of equipment called a @entity108 creates an electromagnetic field around her in the water , discouraging the predators from getting too close			1
@entity3 had planned to stop every half - hour or so to sip an energy drink , preferring that to solid foods			1
she and her team have spent the last nine and a half months planning the trip and studying others ' attempts to try to figure out why they were unable to complete the swim			1
they picked june for their bid in a bit of a tradeoff : while seas are warmer later in the summer , this month typically sees lower concentrations of box jellyfish , whose dangerous stings have scuttled past attempts			0
they even took the lunar cycle into account			0
@entity133 attracts jellyfish to the surface , and that should be less of a problem as she sets off under a new moon			0
@entity3 said she believes she can succeed where others fell short because she has assembled an unprecedented team that includes scientists on land who are experts on the @entity146 current that flows through the straits			2
they will be crunching data in real time and feeding information to her support boat , a 44 - foot catamaran dubbed the ' @entity154 , ' so the mission can dodge things such as the powerful eddies that have swept others off course			0
' the advantage that this gives us is that we can foresee 10 , 20 , 30 kilometers ahead , ' she said			0
' so if we can slightly change our course to avoid things in the future , we 're less likely to get picked up by an eddy off the @entity146 and pushed in the wrong direction			0
' still , she acknowledged there 's no way to guarantee nature 's cooperation			0
' the @entity146 ... it 's like a wild animal , ' @entity3 said			1
' you can not predict it that much in advance , so you can not take historical data from @entity65 or @entity63 's swim and say , well , this is what happened to them , therefore if we do n't do exactly the same then we 'll have a better outcome			2
' map : the treacherous route from @entity24 to @entity7 that @entity3 will take for the 160 - km swim it would seem an unlikely dream for a woman who did n't even learn to swim until she was 10 years old			1
@entity3 , who makes a living doing first - aid training , and her husband took out a second mortgage on their @entity194 home to fund the $ 150,000 in costs associated with the swim			1
so far they have made about half of it back through sponsorships , and leaned heavily on volunteers on donations			0
she 's also hoping to raise money for cancer research and to support people who suffer from the disease			0
at the marina wednesday morning @entity3 was just about to hop into the water when suddenly she turned around and called out for her husband , @entity210			1
' i love you , ' she said , giving him a quick kiss			0
bye ! ' endurance : ' it 's the hardest marathon swim in the entire world , ' the 28 - year - old told reporters			1

@entity3 , 29 , set - off on the 160 - km ( 100 - mile ) swim on wednesday
she had to quit after 11 hours because of the jelly fish sting
had planned on trip taking about 60 hours to complete
since 2011 , four *unsuccessful* , uncaged swims have been attempted
@entity3 : ' it 's the hardest marathon swim in the entire world '
