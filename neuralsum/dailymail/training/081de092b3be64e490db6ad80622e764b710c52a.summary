by @entity0 and @entity1 defence : @entity3 rebutted the clergy 's charge that welfare cuts have been unfair @entity3 has attacked high - ranking clergy for ‘ exaggerating ’ the effects of the government ’s welfare reforms			1
amid a growing row between ministers and church leaders , the deputy prime minister reacted angrily to claims the ‘ safety net ’ for the vulnerable had been removed			1
his comments came in response to an open letter signed by 27 of @entity22 ’s 59 @entity21 bishops which claimed hunger was a ‘ national crisis ’ and ministers had an ‘ acute moral imperative ’ to take action			1
in their letter , the bishops , joined by 15 other faith leaders , said people in @entity22 are ‘ going hungry ’ and that 500,000 have visited food banks since @entity32			1
the letter came after a high - profile intervention by the @entity35 , leader of @entity36 in @entity37 and @entity38 last week , who said the @entity40 ’s benefit savings had left people in a ‘ destitute situation ’ and reliant on food banks			1
and it was backed yesterday by the archbishop of canterbury @entity44 , who agreed with his colleague ’s remarks and said there had been a ‘ swell of feeling ’ about the issue among rank and file clergy			1
but mr @entity3 – who was asked about the issue by a food bank boss on his radio phone - in programme – rebutted the charge that welfare cuts have been unfair , saying failure to tackle the deficit would be irresponsible and that curbing welfare spending has to play a part			1
speaking on @entity64 , mr @entity3 told the boss of the @entity67 food bank in @entity68 : ‘ we inherited this massive black hole in the public finances			1
' there ’s nothing fair about simply saying we ’re not going to deal with our debts			2
we ’re going to let our children and our grandchildren do it			2
’ the @entity35 , leader of @entity36 in @entity37 and @entity38 , said the @entity80 s benefit savings had left people in a ' destitute situation ' and reliant on food banks he added : ‘ what we ’ve done is try to make sure that the way we reform welfare and we reform the tax system encourages people into work			1
i have a huge amount of respect for @entity35			2
' i like him , i ’ve met him a number of times but i think to say that the safety net has been removed altogether is an exaggeration			2
’ mr @entity3 went on to attack those who ‘ denigrate ’ welfare reforms , saying @entity22 is spending ‘ billions of pounds ’ protecting people who need support			1
‘ but what we ’re doing , ’ he said , ‘ is simplifying the system and sharpening the incentive to work			2
it is surely better to see people in work rather than on benefits			2
’ to back up their charge that @entity22 is the world ’s seventh largest economy and yet ‘ people are going hungry ’ , 42 clergymen , including 27 @entity21 bishops , made a series of startling claims			1
the @entity118 ’s @entity117 correspondent @entity1 examines whether they stack up : @entity119 : 5,500 people were admitted to hospital for malnutrition last year			2
reality : the figure is correct , but malnutrition has very little to do with food shortage			2
in fact , the @entity126 advises that especially among children ‘ malnutrition due to inadequate food intake in this country is rare , although it can occur if a child is being neglected or abused ’			2
in adults , too , it is normally associated with another medical condition			2
malnutrition includes obesity as well as the results of eating too little food			2
@entity119 : half a million people have visited food banks in the @entity22 since last @entity32			1
reality : the @entity141 – which runs most food banks – said between last april and december around 500,000 people were given three days ’ worth of emergency food at its banks			2
however , the @entity141 told the @entity118 yesterday that the figures refer to requests for food , not the number of individuals making them			0
so the bishops do not know if 500,000 people have visited food banks once , or 50,000 have gone ten times			0
@entity119 : one in five mothers report regularly skipping meals to better feed their children			0
reality : the assertion appears to be based on a two - year - old survey of questionable academic value , in which the @entity161 website polled 2000 of its members			0
@entity163 of @entity161 said : ‘ we are due to re-run the study shortly with the @entity141 and see whether the situation has improved or become worse			0
no one has been in touch with us about using [ the survey ]			0
’ @entity119 : tens of thousands of older people must ‘ heat or eat ’ each winter			0
reality : no - one doubts that life can be hard for poor pensioners , but there are fewer now than ever before			1
the latest government poverty estimates say that the number of pensioners below the official poverty line , 60 per cent of average income , dropped in 2011/12 by 100,000 from the previous year			1
there were 1.9million pensioners considered poor , down from 2.8million in 1998/99			1
@entity119 : wages have stayed flat while food prices have gone up 30 per cent over the past five years			0
reality : food prices in real terms – after inflation is taken into account – were 12 per cent higher last summer than in 2007			0
until last year , benefits were raised every year strictly in line with inflation			0
@entity195 estimates say that the poorest fifth of all families spent 16.6 per cent of their income on food and drink in 2011 , almost exactly the same as the 16.8 per cent they spent in the year the recession struck , 2008			1
@entity119 : over half of people using food banks have been put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures in the benefit system			0
reality : the @entity141 said in october that 19 per cent of its clients between april and september needed food because of benefit changes			0
a further 35 per cent of clients said they needed food because of delays in benefit payments , but these were nothing to do with recent welfare reforms			1
archbishop @entity44 , the leader of the world ’s 80million @entity220 , said yesterday that the @entity222 was well - placed to comment on welfare as it has people working ‘ on the ground ’ all over the country			1
he said : ‘ it is from the upswell of feeling that they are reporting that sense that they ’re seeing in their own church communities , as priests , as ministers , as pastors , in whichever community that these letters and the comments of @entity238 are coming			0
and i ’m entirely with him			0
’ deputy prime minister yesterday challenged @entity242 to a debate on whether @entity22 should leave the @entity244			1
in a high - risk move , @entity3 said he plans to launch an ‘ aggressive ’ defence of the @entity244			1
but some @entity248 insiders fear the party could be pushed into fifth place in the @entity252 elections on may 22 , behind mr @entity242 ’s @entity253 and even the @entity254			0
@entity253 last night suggested that @entity255 and @entity256 should be invited to participate as well			0
mr @entity242 is expected to accept the challenge when he responds to mr @entity3 ’s offer today			1
but it emerged last night that a number of points in the bishops ’ letter appeared to be based on questionable information			0
for example , a claim that ‘ one in five mothers report regularly skipping meals to better feed their children ’ appears to have come from a two - year - old poll by @entity161			0
and while the letter claimed that ‘ over half of people using food banks ’ had been ‘ put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures of the benefits system ’ , a study found that only 19 per cent of those using food banks said they were doing so because of benefits changes			0
last week @entity238 , the archbishop of @entity284 , told @entity286 ’s @entity285 : ‘ there are many cases where people are left without benefits , without any support for sometimes weeks on end			0
‘ the voices i hear express anger and despair			0
something is going seriously wrong when , in a country as affluent as ours , there are people in that destitute situation depending on food banks			0
’ but a spokesman for the @entity303 said there was no robust evidence that welfare reforms were increasing food bank use			1
they added : ‘ it ’s wrong to talk of removing a safety net when we ’re spending £ 94billion a year on working age benefits and supporting millions of people			0
’ and a @entity315 spokesman said : ‘ of course many families are facing tough times as a result of the worst recession in a century			0
‘ that ’s why our welfare reforms are about building a country where people are not trapped in a cycle of dependency but are able to get on , stand on their own two feet and build a better life for themselves and their family			1
