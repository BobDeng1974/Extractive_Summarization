@entity0 has surprisingly been denied a place on the @entity3 board , a snub that casts doubts on his future as the sport ’s all - powerful svengali			1
although grand prix ’s octogenarian puppeteer walked free from a @entity12 court in august after a prolonged bribery trial , he has failed in his attempt to win back his place at @entity16 , the board comprising the sport ’s shareholders			1
sources have told @entity20 that when the board met they insisted on conditions being imposed on @entity0 ’s return			1
@entity0 will not be returning to the board of formula one despite the end of his bribery trial some within the sport are said to be unhappy about the adverse publicity @entity0 's trial has brought the sport 's boss paid £ 60million to end the trial with his innocence intact in august of this year the delay undermines @entity0 ’s bullish back - to - business mantra , summed up by his post-trial declaration : ‘ i shall follow my old idea in life , “ do n’t get mad ; get even ”			1
i have n’t got mad , but i am going to get even			0
’ it also contradicts his insistence in january , when he stepped down from @entity16 to fight the accusations in @entity44 , that he would return in total command the moment the case was resolved			0
he paid £ 60million to end the trial and left with his innocence intact			0
however , several shareholders were embarrassed when a high court judge described @entity0 as an ‘ unreliable witness ’ in a civil action earlier this year			1
the wildest , but not necessarily ill - informed , rumours suggest that @entity0 could be discarded within a fortnight			1
it remains equally likely that his critics on the board are trying to impose rules to govern his future conduct in the business			2
either way , it seems , he no longer has carte blanche to act as he wishes			0
however , even though he turns 84 at the end of the month , @entity0 is showing no inclination to give in to time or pressure			1
the @entity3 season moves on from @entity68 to @entity69 , with @entity70 in the championship lead @entity0 had insisted that it would be business as usual after his trial , but things may not be as simple @entity0 ’s long - term protector and greatest admirer has been @entity78 , the chairman of @entity3 ’s majority owners @entity79			1
an affable man in private , @entity81 is publicly reticent to the point of invisibility			0
as did @entity0 , who is not expected at sunday ’s @entity69 @entity86 but will be in @entity87 , @entity88 for the inaugural grand prix there next week			1
yesterday the @entity69 was a blanket of rain and cloud , with @entity93 expected here at the end of the weekend			2
despite that , and with not a single car running , the main grandstand was full			0
they adore @entity3 here , a love affair that started when @entity100 drove through life - threatening rain in @entity102 to beat @entity103			2
the typhoon has been gathering potency in the western @entity106 and is due to arrive in mainland @entity69 , possibly during the grand prix			0
the @entity109 ’s latest weather forecast indicates it will strike either very late on sunday or on monday			0
but some rain , at least , is expected to interrupt the race			2
@entity70 seemed affronted when it was suggested he did not want a wet race in @entity69 this weekend there is no chance of the main event being moved to monday			2
this travelling circus is scuttling off to @entity87 with barely time to pack , as it is			0
@entity0 ’s right - hand man , @entity118 , is missing the @entity69 race and will go straight to @entity88 to make sure everything is shipshape for his master and his master ’s big buddy , president @entity122			1
neither of the two world championship participants , @entity70 and @entity124 , view the rain as entirely unwelcome			1
‘ the more the better , ’ said @entity124 , who trails @entity70 by three points after an electrical problem in @entity68 a fortnight ago			1
as for @entity70 , two of the most stellar drives of his career were victories in the wet			2
in @entity102 in 2007 , when the safety car literally almost ran out of fuel because it stayed out for 19 long laps , and at @entity137 the following year			0
he was understandably indignant when he was asked how he fared in bad conditions , replying : ‘ have you not been watching @entity3 for the last eight years ? ’ along the paddock at @entity143 , @entity141 could not commit to the team or , indeed , to a move away			0
the smokescreen , mirrors and conjecture surrounding his future was , it was suggested by a @entity152 journalist , being whipped up by @entity141 ’s manager @entity153			0
@entity143 ’s pr chief nodded knowingly as the old bronzed plotter ’s name was mentioned			0
cash - strapped @entity157 , who were recently bought out by an unidentified ‘ consortium of @entity161 and @entity160 investors ’ said that they are planning to race despite bailiffs seizing items from their @entity166 factory this week .			2

@entity0 walked free from bribery trial in august
the 84 - year - old had been expected to resume his place on the board
some suggestions that he could be discarded from the sport in near future
@entity124 and @entity70 both happy for the *upcoming* race to be rain - affected
