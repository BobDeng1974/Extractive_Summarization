in a bid to cock a snook at the increasingly commercial nature of @entity4 , we penned a note to the man in red and asked for a rural hideaway where crackling fires , bucolic splendour and wintry walks would distract us from @entity13 ads and @entity15 sales			1
we would , we decided , load up our respective cars and head west with tinsel , turkey and a democratic approach to the washing up			0
our setting for four days of cracker - pulling / pudding - igniting / fizz - quaffing was high up in the @entity23 , an area of outstanding beauty on the border between @entity27 and @entity28			1
winter escape : the @entity30 is perfect for a @entity4 break stunning view : the beautiful @entity27 cottage is situated on acres of farmland @entity35 is not a farm per se			1
but with its thatched , stone cottages , airway - clearing smells and soundtrack of bleats and neighs , it certainly feels like the real deal			1
it is an agricultural retreat where the likes of you and i can walk the @entity49 walk - clad in wellies and wax jackets – without actually having to get our hands dirty			2
indeed , those who do wind north from the @entity56 , and nudge through the pillar - box red doors of any one of these six self - catering cottages , will find thoughtful plushness			1
luxury rooms : one of the twin suites inside the beautiful country cottage in spring : @entity63 is part of the wider @entity30 - which sits in the @entity27 countryside do come in , the fire 's on : @entity63 is an excellent spot to hide from the madness of @entity4 owners @entity71 and @entity72 have dedicated much of the last three years to ensuring that life on this farm is n’t that dissimilar to bedding down in a five - star hotel			1
@entity78 comfy @entity77 mattresses are draped in @entity80 cotton sheets			0
there is wi - fi access and a code for the communal indoor swimming pool , where the waters are a toasty 30 degrees @entity87			1
@entity88 , so often stolen by last - gasp consumerism , passed instead in said heated waters - with a side - venture into petting the farm ’s animals			1
@entity35 ’ guests are invited to help give breakfast to a host of its furry , four - legged inhabitants			2
this makes for a lovely introduction to farm life for younger children , for these are gentle breeds			0
we met chickens , ducks , a guinea pig called @entity109 and a pygmy goat called @entity111			0
they seemed to be old hands at dealing with eager young faces ( as long as you brandished carrots / grain in their direction )			0
a world wonder : the @entity120 - a splendid sight at any time of year - is within reach @entity123 deep and crisp and even : @entity125 can be a hugely picturesque place , even on a cold winter 's day december 25th arrived , and staying at @entity35 felt like the collective gift to ourselves that we had hoped it might be			1
some of the rituals remained the same			0
by 8am , the living room was lost to shiny , scrunched - up paper			2
but it was spirit - lifting to be in unfamiliar , beautiful surroundings			2
and our cottage had everything we needed for a portable @entity4 , including a decorated tree and a disposable roasting tin for the bird			1
after we had overindulged , 95 miles of fossil - laden , crumbling drama that is the @entity120 was happy to put us through our paces			2
book - ended by @entity145 in the west and @entity147 in the east , this craggy wonder is easily accessible from @entity35 - as is the quiet , useful high street of nearby @entity150			0
the cobwebs were blown away on @entity15 at @entity125 , where we watched waves crash and foam from the safety of the esplanade before retreating into the pretty regency streets for tea			0
@entity71 and @entity72 are determined that @entity35 should be a year - round proposition			1
the @entity27 air bites in winter , but i can easily imagine these hills carpeted with flowers as the mercury rises			2
fun for all the family : guests at @entity30 are encouraged to feed the ( friendly ) resident animals making a splash : if the weather outside is a little on the cold side , a dip in the pool will keep you warm @entity174 brings snowdrops , daffodils , bluebells and crocuses on nearby @entity179 , an @entity180 fort			1
guests can witness lambing , and watch cows lumbering past on their way to milking			0
there is also the tantalising prospect of long summer nights - grilling local cuts of meat on the bbq ; watching the kids battle with daylight to avoid checkmate on the outdoor chess set , or taking late - night leaps on the trampoline			0
the surrounding green hills are fertile with foodie produce			0
our holiday cottage looked across at the @entity201 , which serves homemade ice - cream in its summerhouse from march until october - but also opens in december to offer @entity4 - themed gelato as an alternative to brandy butter			1
so it was @entity4 but not as we knew it , as cosy as an @entity209 yuletide could be without snow			2
we relished the opportunity to tune out of urban life , gather around proper , sparking logs every night , and eat , drink and toast @entity214			0
and the washing up ? @entity217 , we just switched on the dishwasher and went swimming			0
a week ’s stay in @entity30 's @entity63 for up to six people starts from £ 775 and a short break from £ 540			1
