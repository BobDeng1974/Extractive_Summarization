a @entity1 police chief has come to the defense of his officers after a video surfaced on @entity5 showing two white @entity7 cops dragging a black youth out of a car and threatening his friend with a gun during a traffic stop			1
the brief , often shaky cell phone video laced with profanities , which was recorded in february 2013 , was uploaded online last month by the user @entity15 under the title , ‘ 1 of my encounters with @entity7 beach pd … ’ the clip begins with a mustachioed and bespectacled police sergeant having a barely audible exchange with the driver of the car and its other occupants , asking them where they live			1
' you 're driving the car - that 's why i need your @entity38 , ' replies the sergeant , then adding , ' i need everybody ’s @entity38			0
' one of the occupants of the vehicle says that he is going to start recording the traffic stop			0
' turn that phone off right now , ' the sergeant orders the young man sitting in the back			2
‘ no , i have rights			0
i ’m not intimidated , i have right , sir			0
i 'm recording your ass ... b * * * * , you 're on camera , ’ the passenger defiantly declares to the cop			0
one of the men then asks the bearded cop to provide his badge number and name , but the officer keeps mum , prompting the occupant of the vehicle to pull out his cell phone to try and take a photo of the officer 's name tag			2
the situation quickly escalates when the sergeant slaps the phone out of the man ’s hand , drags him out of the car and places him face - down on the grass			2
the passenger ’s friends could be heard in the background crying out in disbelief			0
a moment later , the sergeant ’s partner jumps into action , charging at the vehicle with his gun drawn			0
the cop thrusts his weapon inside the cabin , telling one of the men inside : ‘ i ’ll put a round in your a * * so quick			0
’ escalation : the sergeant slapped the phone from a young man 's hands ( left ) for recording him and then dragged him out of the vehicle and put him face - down in the grass ( right ) armed and dangerous : a second officer charged at the car with his service weapon drawn on tuesday , @entity7 police chief @entity125 posted a detailed comment in reaction to the @entity5 video , defending the actions of the officer who was recorded pointing his service weapon inside a car occupied by several young men and threatening to shoot them for refusing to stop filming			1
chief @entity125 wrote that he first watched the recording a year ago , and lamented that it continues to surface ' despite the fact nobody has made a complaint or provided helpful information from which we could put this incident in context or take corrective action if applicable			2
' according to the chief , his staff investigated the incident and determined that the traffic stop took place on february 4 , 2013			1
@entity125 explained that the young men in the car were stopped by police because they were within a 2 - mile perimeter the officers had set up after a home invasion where the perpetrators were armed with a machete			1
aggressive action : the cop thrust his weapon inside the cabin , telling one of the men inside : ‘ i ’ll put a round in your a * * so quick ’ ‘ the persons within the vehicle were – as you can see on the video – less than cooperative and , in some cases antagonistic toward the officers , ' @entity125 wrote in reaction to the video			2
he added that the sergeant ' felt threatened ' when he saw the driver reach out of the window holding a black object in his hand - which turned out to be his cell phone			1
advocate : @entity7 police chief @entity125 has defended his officers , insisting that their actions were justifiable in light of the antagonism displayed by the young men in the car chief @entity125 proceeded to point a finger of blame at the occupants of the car , who allegedly acted with antagonism towards the officers during the traffic stop , and by doing so provoked the escalation of the cops ’ ' stress response			1
’ ‘ when i watch this video , i do n’t see a car full of young men who are behaving in a manner consistent with fear of the police , ’ @entity125 stated			1
‘ these young men are escalating this incident , being uncooperative with officers who are investigating a violent crime , and recording their interaction – presumably with the hopes of catching a “ gotcha ” moment on the part of our personnel			0
‘ i hate to disappoint them , but no gotcha moment exists here … which is why i suspect nobody ever came forward to make a complaint about this			0
’ this is not the first time that @entity7 police officers were accused of using excessive force and resorting to brutality			1
in may of this year , another cell phone video surfaced online showing officers apparently putting a sixth - grader in a choke - hold and kicking him to the ground			1
at the time , a police spokesman said that no formal complaint has been filed in connection to the incident , but one officer was placed on administrative leave			0
the video of the february 2013 police altercation comes at a time when law enforcement agencies around the nation are facing intense scrutiny , especially in their dealings with black youths , in light of @entity244 's killing in @entity245 , @entity246 .			2

a cell phone video of the confrontation was recorded february 4 , 2013 , in @entity7 , @entity1
the clip shows a police sergeant dragging a young black man from a car and his partner pulling a gun on another passenger
@entity7 police chief @entity125 defended the officers ' actions , saying the occupants of the car were antagonistic and had no ' fear of police '
