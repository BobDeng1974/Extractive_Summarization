@entity0 is expected to take @entity1 back into the top three in the @entity3 this season — and he will have to do it without any major signings in january			1
the target was revealed by executive vice-chairman @entity7 as he detailed the club ’s accounts for last season and made forecasts for this campaign			1
figures published show @entity1 had record income of £ 433.2million for the 2013 - 14 season , but that is expected to plunge to £ 395m because the club are not in the @entity18 , from which they made about £ 55m last season			1
this is mainly because of a £ 55m black hole caused by @entity1 not being in the @entity18			1
last year they earned £ 36m in prize money and £ 19m from five @entity18 home games			2
£ 5.2m compensation pay - offs made to former manager @entity52 and to ‘ certain members of the coaching staff ’ who were axed last season			1
£ 214.8m @entity1 ’s total wage bill in 2013 - 14 , £ 34.3m more than the previous season , a whopping 19 per cent rise			1
and that is before this summer ’s transfer spree			0
£ 341.8m gross debt still sitting on the books as a result of the @entity66 ’ takeover in 2005			0
this was down 12.2 per cent year on year , from £ 389.2m , but @entity1 spent £ 27.4m on interest and debt - related payments in 2013 - 14			1
getting back into @entity70 is an urgent priority for @entity1 and @entity72 confirmed @entity74 ’s target when he said : ‘ we assume third in our budgets			0
’ another consequence of @entity52 ’ miserable year in charge was £ 5.2m in ‘ exceptional costs ’ , most of which represented compensation payments to the former manager and his staff			1
@entity7 gave the strongest indication yet that there will not be a further splurge in january to follow the £ 153.1m spent on @entity23 , @entity28 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
‘ we do n’t intend to significantly increase capital expenditure [ by buying players ] in january , ’ he said during a conference call aimed at investors in the 10 per cent of the club that is traded on the @entity95			2
‘ we will continue to monitor in association with @entity100 his view of the squad and which areas we want to strengthen and which areas we want to sell			0
i would n’t have expectations for january but if there is a willingness from the manager , we will engage with him and if there is an opportunity , we will try and take that as we did last january			0
’ @entity7 said the club was ‘ very proud ’ of the record income figures and added : ‘ with @entity0 at the helm as manager , and the recent signing of some of the world ’s leading players to further strengthen our squad , we are very excited about the future and believe it ’s the start of a new chapter in the club ’s history			1
‘ louis ’ footballing philosophy fits very well with @entity1 and he has an impressive track record of success throughout his career , winning league titles with every club he has managed			2
’ new boy : @entity1 splashed out a £ 6million loan fee to bring @entity91 to @entity134 on loan same again ? @entity7 admitted that @entity1 could spend in january , as they did to sign @entity137 ( right ) rebuilding job : @entity74 has assembled a new - look squad at @entity134 but may want to spend more @entity140 wo n't win title - @entity20 one potentially worrying figure for @entity1 was their wage bill of £ 214.8m , up 19 per cent on the previous year			1
@entity1 say salaries will drop in 2014 - 15 because there will be no @entity18 bonuses , though they are not expected to fall by much			1
@entity1 ’s debts have fallen 12.2 per cent year - on - year but still stand at £ 341.8m — all a result of the @entity66 family ’s leveraged takeover in 2005			2
@entity1 spent £ 27.4m serving the debt in 2013 - 14 , approximately the price of @entity89			1
critics of the @entity66 family regularly cite the amounts spent on debt financing — now well over £ 500m — that might have been used to bring in more big - name players			0
compensation : it cost @entity1 £ 5.2m to sack @entity52 and his coaching staff last season but the debt in itself does not endanger @entity1 ’s future			1
they remain by a considerable margin @entity165 ’s richest club by income			0
in global terms , only @entity24 , @entity167 and @entity168 are at their level of half a billion euros of income or more per year			0
the club ’s revenue last season was split between match day income of £ 108.1m — effectively from ticket sales , pies , pints and programmes — at an average of £ 3.5m per game at @entity134 ; £ 189.3m from sponsorship , kit deals and other commercial partnerships ; and broadcasting income of £ 135.8m			2
match day income is likely to remain stable			0
the other two streams are growing , respectively up 24.1 per cent ( commercial ) and 33 per cent ( tv ) year - on - year and are likely to increase significantly in the medium term			0
the recently announced kit deal with adidas is worth £ 75m per year for 10 years from 2015 - 16 , £ 50m more every year than the expiring @entity192 deal			0
they can expect to pocket tv money of between £ 90m and £ 100m from the @entity3 this season and next			0
that is likely to go up under the tv rights deals for 2016 - 19 , which are due to be negotiated soon			0
@entity18 income for @entity26 clubs will also soar from next season because of @entity202 ’s near £ 1bn deal to show all @entity204 football from 2015 - 16			2
last season ’s £ 36m @entity70 cash for @entity1 could feasibly be double that or more by next season — as long as they are back at @entity70 ’s top table .			2

manager @entity0 will be allowed to recommend new players despite spending £ *150million* on talent over the summer
@entity7 's *announcement* came after the club revealed their financial results for 2013 - 14
@entity1 reported a record annual revenue of £ 433.2m and profits of £ 23.8m
but they expect a 10 per cent drop in revenue after failing to make the @entity18 last season
former boss @entity52 and his staff were paid £ 5.2m in compensation after being sacked
annual wages have now pushed through the £ 200m mark after a 19 per cent rise
