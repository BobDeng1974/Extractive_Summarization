apparently some phones are made of sterner stuff - especially one @entity4 woman 's @entity2 , which survived a drop from a small airplane on friday and was returned unscathed to its owner			1
@entity10 and her 10 - year - old son were riding as passengers in a three - seat plane on friday for an aerial tour of @entity15 , courtesy of a family friend who happens to be a pilot			2
when the plane neared @entity20 's @entity15 neighborhood , she lifted her @entity2 to snap a photo			1
phone a friend : @entity10 displays the @entity2 she accidentally dropped out of an airplane which then landed in the front yard of @entity25 ( pictured left ) ' i was trying to zoom it on my phone , and the wind just caught it and ripped it out of my hand , ' @entity20 said			1
a panicked @entity20 watched as the phone spiraled away , soaring down an estimated 1,400 feet toward the city			1
' all that kept going through my head was , " i hope i do n't get home and it 's all over the news that i knocked somebody out or somebody got killed or it hit a windshield and caused a car accident , " ' she said			0
resigned to the fact that her beloved phone had been decimated , she nevertheless called her number when she got home			0
to her surprise , the phone rang but no one answered			0
still , she and her husband suspended the account and , after being told the drop was n't covered by the phone 's warranty , thought the situation to be over			0
monday afternoon , @entity25 had just left his house to check the mail when he noticed an orange cellphone sitting in his yard about six feet from the curb			0
' my neighbor was out here , and i thought it might have been his daughter 's phone , ' @entity25 said			1
fear of falling : when @entity10 dropped her phone from a small airplane , she believed it would be smashed to smithereens after realizing that was n't the case , @entity25 charged the phone and called the last number the phone had dialed - @entity76 , the pilot of the airplane from which the phone had fallen			1
' i said , " hey , i found this phone			0
" he paused and then said , " you 're kidding me , " ' @entity25 said			0
' he asked what it looked like , and i said , " it looks great , like somebody dropped it out of their pocket while walking			0
" he said that , no , it fell 1,400 - feet out of an airplane			1
' not only had the phone survived the fall , it was in pristine condition , even after a weekend storm			0
@entity20 said she did n't have any kind of tracker installed on the phone , so she was stunned when her husband approached her monday evening and told her it had been found in working condition			2
the @entity2 , in a @entity103 case , is now back in @entity20 's possession , but the story got even stranger when @entity25 told @entity20 his job title - air - traffic controller			1
' it 's just crazy , ' @entity25 said			2
while it 's unknown if scientists worldwide will begin studying the phone 's composition , @entity20 said she plans to notify the makers of @entity103 and the @entity114 its harrowing journey .			2
