it 's one of the most memorable tunes in the history of pop. @entity4 ’s 1961 hit @entity3 is the biggest - selling instrumental single of all time – and became the first @entity9 recording ever to reach no 1 in the @entity11 charts			1
now , 53 years after its release , and in the month in which clarinettist @entity4 sadly passed away at the age of 85 , the premises in @entity14 ’s @entity13 where he recorded the famous track have been put on the market for £ 7.5 million – as a four - bedroom flat			1
until eight years ago the property was @entity24 – one of the most famous recording spaces in @entity14 where , besides @entity4 , stars such as @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 laid down tracks			1
spatial and interior designer @entity33 and her husband @entity34 , 50 , bought the property from the studio ’s owner and engineer @entity38 in 2006			2
vast : the kitchen and studio area , which was once a studio , where artists including @entity28 , recorded @entity33 , 52 , recalls the couple living in the space for a year with their teenage sons before she began realising their dream of converting it into the apartment it is today			1
‘ we had n’t even got full planning permission when we bought it and a number of things had to be ironed out before we could get started , ’ she says			2
‘ of course it had the huge studio window which separated the mixing desks from the studio area			0
the boys loved it – because of the soundproofing , they could have 20 mates around and we would n’t even know they were there			0
’ @entity63 recorded 1961 hit @entity3 on the premises the flat is in @entity66 , which was built in 1904 as a place where struggling painters could work			1
there are 11 other flats in the building			0
at @entity24 , besides the studio space there was a ‘ smoking room ’ and a thermal bath			1
the transformation of the property into a luxury living space took five years – and @entity33 not only needed her design skills but a great deal of logic , too , as she wrestled with complex problems involving wiring and plumbing			1
‘ i did n’t know what i was letting myself in for , ’ she jokes			0
such was the transformation of the property that it was featured in magazines and on tv shows , including @entity90			1
@entity33 ’s job was made easier by some of the natural features of the space , which is spread over three floors – lower ground , ground and first floor , including its 12ft windows in the ground floor reception room , and the original fireplaces ( @entity33 has restored the building ’s 90ft chimney )			2
she also rescued some parquet flooring , which has been put to use in the reception room			0
taking centre stage in the flat are two beautifully crafted skylights , installed by the @entity109			2
the four double bedrooms each has an en suite bathroom , and there ’s a luxury wet room , gym , cinema room and wine room			0
there are two terraces , one of which can be used for parking			0
what was once the studio space is now the vast kitchen / dining area			0
distinctive : the exterior of the building in @entity14 's @entity13 which was formerly home to @entity24 @entity38 clearly remembers the day @entity4 arrived to record his most famous song in this space			1
‘ it was a three - hour session and @entity4 was recording with the @entity130			1
there were about 25 musicians in there – violins , violas , cellos			0
in those days they all played live together – there was none of the individual “ takes ” you get now and they had it all wrapped up in 25 minutes			0
the song was then called @entity144 , as it was written for his wife			0
@entity4 called everyone “ @entity148 ” for some reason and he kept saying “ is that all right , @entity148 ? ” when we were recording it			2
’ price £ 7.5 million location : @entity13 , @entity14 bedrooms : four unique features : luxury wet room , gym , cinema room and wine room ; starred in @entity90 ; fascinating history as a recording studio ; the place where @entity4 recorded @entity3 @entity38 has a very different memory of the day riotous punk band @entity164 came to record at @entity24			1
‘ they were a very rough - and - ready crowd , ’ he recalls			2
‘ they were doing a night session and i came in the following morning			0
they had sprayed shaving foam all over the studio window , their dog had messed on the carpet and they had spilled wine over a mixing desk ! ’ @entity33 is keen to keep alive the musical memories of her flat and has portraits of a number of the artists who recorded there – including the @entity164 – on the wall			1
