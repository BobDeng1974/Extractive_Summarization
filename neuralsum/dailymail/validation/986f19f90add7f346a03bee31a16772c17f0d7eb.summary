@entity1 is beheading criminals at an unprecedented rate - almost half of them for non-violent drugs crimes , the human rights charity @entity0 has warned			1
the @entity7 state is believed to have executed 38 people so far this year , treble the number in the same period in 2014 and a sign its new @entity11 is showing no mercy to offenders			1
now @entity0 has sounded the latest of several warnings over the country 's ' unfair ' justice system and harsh punishments			1
regime : some 38 people have already been beheaded in @entity1 this year			1
@entity11 ( above meeting @entity20 prime minister @entity19 ) was crowned in january and shows no sign of leniency the charity 's @entity1 researcher , @entity23 , told @entity25 of @entity26 : ' almost half of this year 's executions have actually been for non-violent drugs - related offences			1
' there 's no real rhyme or reason for this upsurge in executions , and in a way this makes it all the more alarming			0
' the @entity1 authorities insist there is a surge in the number of executions because rape , murder , apostasy , armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death under @entity1 's version of @entity50 sharia law			2
no mercy : @entity11 pictured in january one diplomatic source told the @entity54 news agency the surge in beheadings had started long before the reign of @entity11 , who was crowned in january after the death of his half - brother @entity59			1
' the @entity1 authorities want to show everyone they are strong , people can rely on them to keep the security and the safety in the kingdom , ' said the source			1
the insider claimed the aim was to deter all forms of violence but the policy is linked to the kingdom 's fight against the @entity74			0
in september , @entity1 began air strikes against the terrorists in @entity77 as part of the @entity80 - led coalition , raising concerns about possible retaliation inside the kingdom			0
security officers arrested three @entity1 who allegedly acted ' in support of ' the group when they shot and wounded a @entity88 in november			0
but mr @entity23 said : ' the current rate has been truly unprecedented			0
it would ... be a stretch to say that this is an attempt to deter violence			0
' the @entity94 has said many @entity1 trials are ' by all accounts grossly unfair ' and that confessions are obtained under torture			0
@entity0 's annual report last week made a similar warning			2
' courts continued to impose death sentences for a range of crimes , including some that did not involve violence , such as " sorcery " , adultery and drug offences , frequently after unfair trials , ' it said			2
trickle of news : individual beheadings are only discovered when confirmed by the @entity116 ( above ) ' some defendants , including foreign nationals facing murder charges , alleged that they had been tortured or otherwise coerced or misled into making false confessions in pre-trial detention			0
' those executed have included five @entity123 , an @entity124 , two @entity125 , two @entity77 and a @entity126 , with few foreign governments willing to appeal publicly for clemency from the oil - rich state			2
three beheadings in a single day on tuesday - one for rape and two for murder - took the total so far this year to 38 , according to an @entity54 tally .			1

@entity0 says @entity7 state has beheaded 38 people this year
that is treble the number executed over the same period in 2014
charity says nearly half have been for non-violent drugs crimes
tally seen as sign new @entity11 will show no mercy to offenders
