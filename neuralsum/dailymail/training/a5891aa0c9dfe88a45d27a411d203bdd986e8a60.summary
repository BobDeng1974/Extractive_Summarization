inconsistencies : while during the trial @entity2 said he first saw @entity5 's body in the trunk of her car outside this @entity155 , in the interview with @entity3 he said it took place outside his grandmother 's house burial ground : @entity2 admitted to have assisted @entity8 in burying @entity33 's body at @entity89 in @entity35 in @entity41 ’s podcast , much has been made of the many inconsistencies , both big and small , in @entity2 ’ story , and how it kept changing over time , from his first interview with police to his testimony in @entity8 ’s second trial			1
producer : @entity41 is the producer and former @entity202 reporter who has created the cult podcast addressing the discrepancies , @entity2 said initially he was not willing to cooperate with police for fear of incriminating himself as a drug dealer , and also because he did not want to get his friends in trouble in connection to the @entity5 murder			1
‘ i was n’t fully cooperating , so if they said , “ well , we have on phone records that you talked to @entity216			0
” i ’d say , “ nope , i did n’t talk to @entity216			0
” until @entity216 told me that she talked with the cops and that it was ok if i did too			0
