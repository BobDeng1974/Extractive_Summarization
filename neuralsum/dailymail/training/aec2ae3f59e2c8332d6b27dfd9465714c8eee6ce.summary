the libel arose following a @entity42 programme last november over the abuse of young boys at care homes in @entity46			2
it alleged that ‘ a leading @entity8 politician from the @entity49 years ’ had been involved			0
as speculation raged over his identity , mrs @entity1 posted on @entity12 : ‘ why is @entity2 trending ? * innocent face * ’ the allegation was without foundation and @entity2 announced that he would pursue those who libelled him			1
the peer agreed a £ 185,000 settlement with the @entity42 and £ 125,000 with @entity59			2

however , mrs @entity1 ‘ was not prepared at the relevant time to avail herself of this reasonable offer ’			1
