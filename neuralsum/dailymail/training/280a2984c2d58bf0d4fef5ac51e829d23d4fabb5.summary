by @entity0 published : 16:48 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 3 june 2013 when @entity3 was criticised for not doing enough to block child porn on the internet , it hit back by making great play of its support for online watchdog the @entity9			1
yesterday the extent of that support was revealed – a donation of just £ 20,000 or equivalent to 90 seconds ’ profit for the internet giant			1
the @entity16 - based charity , which seeks to police child abuse images online , is so short of funds that its five staff are unable to keep up with the number of websites being reported			1
' library ' : @entity23 ( right ) had compiled a collection of sickening images before killing @entity23 ( left ) @entity3 has already come under fire for paying just £ 6million in corporation tax in the @entity28 , despite sales worth £ 3.2billion in 2011			1
critics say the foundation would be able to take much more effective action against child abuse sites if internet companies gave them more money			1
other web firms are no more generous than @entity3 , according to the charity ’s accounts			2
@entity39 donated about £ 10,000 , while @entity42 ’s @entity41 search engine gave about £ 20,000			2
@entity43 , whose daughter @entity44 was murdered by pornography addict @entity45 in 2003 , said internet firms must ‘ get their act together ’ and start tackling violent online imagery			1
‘ what annoys me immensely is that @entity3 wo n’t block these sites , ’ she said			2
‘ they say we ’ve got to have freedom			0
all i ask them is where was my daughter ’s freedom – tell me that			0
’ web companies are under increased scrutiny following the conviction of @entity23 , who was jailed for life for the murder of five - year - old @entity23			1
he had collected a ‘ library ’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on @entity3 and @entity41 in the weeks before the abduction			0
both he and @entity71 , who murdered 12 - year - old @entity71 , had no previous convictions for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the internet to committing child murder			1
viewed child porn : @entity71 ( right ) had searched for images online before killing 12 - year - old @entity71 ( left ) last week @entity80 , chief executive of the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , warned it did not have the resources to track down all users of internet child porn			1
and on friday , @entity86 , the @entity87 business secretary , became the first @entity89 member to call for @entity3 to be ‘ more proactive in policing what is there ’			0
@entity94 ’s media spokesman @entity93 said last night : ‘ @entity3 ’s donation of £ 20,000 to the @entity9 can not hide the fact that they paid only £ 6million in tax at a time when the police lack the resources to arrest everyone they know is downloading child abuse images			1
‘ bringing @entity103 to trial cost £ 9million			0
what we need is urgent @entity108 action on this			0
’ @entity3 has used its membership of the foundation to justify taking little action to proactively block child porn on the web			1
last month , when a group of charities demanded urgent action to prevent access to illegal and ‘ disgusting ’ child pornography via web browsers , a @entity3 statement read : ‘ we are members and joint funders of the @entity9			1
’ but the revelation that its funding amounts to just £ 20,000 has infuriated critics			0
@entity128 , chairman of the @entity130 home affairs committee , called on internet companies to do far more to ensure the foundation is properly resourced			1
he said : ‘ i am shocked that , despite the importance they have said they place on its role in keeping our children safe , they have donated such paltry amounts to it , which for them represent a drop in the ocean			0
‘ as it stands , it is difficult to take their commitment to protecting our children seriously			0
’ the foundation and its five - strong team of analysts are being overwhelmed as reports of child abuse sites soared by 40 per cent compared with last year , to 40,000 – or 150 a day			1
sir @entity155 , chairman of the charity ’s board of trustees , said : ‘ there ’s certainly scope for increasing our number of analysts and we know if we had more analysts we could do better			0
if we could get more money that would enable us to do more			1
’ donation : @entity3 has given £ 20,000 to a @entity16 - based internet porn watchdog - the equivalent to 90 seconds ' profit @entity168 , of the @entity169 on internet safety , said : ‘ @entity3 ’s moral leadership is essential here			1
they are the biggest player in this space in the world			0
‘ they can and should be proactive – if they did it , i think others would have to follow			0
’ last night @entity3 said the £ 20,000 was merely a membership fee			0
the company said it had given the charity ’s @entity180 counterpart , the @entity182 , millions of dollars			0
@entity183 , director of communications and public policy outside the @entity180 , said : ‘ @entity3 has a zero - tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content			2
we are members and joint funders of the @entity9 – an independent body that searches the web for child abuse imagery and then sends us links , which we remove from our search index			1
‘ when we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it , we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities			0
’ @entity94 has demanded that ministers force @entity3 to filter out horrific child porn websites from its searches			2
the party has unveiled a three - point plan which would make the search engine take tough action to prevent the perpetrators of vile child sex attacks from accessing such sites			2
media spokesman @entity93 said that if she were in power she would force @entity3 to put up warning messages before people enter websites containing unlawful child porn images			2
she said that if a warning that such sites were illegal flashed up , it would act as a deterrent from looking at them in future			0
there is evidence that once people start looking at such images , they then seek out more and more hard - core examples			2
@entity94 would also ensure that no one could see adult sites if they were underage by putting in place the same sort of strict age verification check in place on gambling websites			0
as well as protecting children , this will also force people to hand over identifiable details about themselves – such as credit card details – so they can be tracked down by police if need be			0
finally , miss @entity93 said : ‘ the industry should be making safe searches the default , instead of expecting people to download the filters themselves			0
’ the internet industry says there should be few restrictions on porn because it is not illegal			1
but miss @entity93 said that in the real world , outside the internet , there is no automatic access to adult material .			2

internet giant gives just a *fraction* of its profits to @entity28 porn watchdog
@entity16 - based @entity9 short of money
