it 's back ! the @entity1 returns ! with more than 80 top schools vying for the @entity4 , we think you ’ll agree it is by far the best schools competition in the country			1
and unlike a knockout , which tests the better team on any given day , our winners will have proved themselves over four tough months of rugby			2
in more than @entity13 matches last year , 110 ended in wins by seven points or less			0
judging by more than four million hits on schoolsrugby.co.uk , the competition was followed avidly by players , fellow pupils , parents , staff and all fans of schools rugby			2
for 2014 we have have made the competition even stronger			0
the biggest change is to the bonus points system , which rewards schools who play higher - ranked teams			1
last year 's winners : @entity32 from @entity33 lifted the inaugural @entity1 it was always going to be very difficult to arrive at the perfect formula for the first year and we are excited about the continued evolution of the competition			1
we ca n’t wait for the new season to start and believe firmly the drama will match that of 2013			0
