by @entity0 for @entity1 even a total golfing novice would fancy their chances of getting down in three putts from 4ft yet incredibly it proved beyond the best player in the world at the @entity9 on saturday			1
two majors this summer plus two other notable triumphs proved no protection when @entity13 stood over his four footer for a par at the par three 12th – and ended up walking off the green with a triple bogey six			1
the 25 - year - old powered the first putt 6ft past the hole and was so disgusted when that putt lipped out he lost concentration completely and missed the consequent tiddler as well			1
miss : @entity13 missed a four - foot put at the @entity9 in @entity24 disappointing : the world no 1 carded a triple bogey on the 12th after missing the put only in golf can the very best sometimes be reduced to hapless performers like the rest of us			1
@entity13 did respond with a birdie at the next but could n’t repair the damage and had to settle for a 72 that has left him nine shots behind the leader , @entity37 @entity36 , who shot a fabulous 63			1
‘ what happened at the 12th completely derailed me , ’ admitted @entity13			1
‘ i misread the first one , hit a bad putt with the second one and then just lost concentration going for the tap - in			2
so obviously , from being right there in the tournament , dropping three shots in one hole was n’t what i wanted			0
’ after all the great rounds @entity13 has played this summer – this was only his second round over par out of the last 22 – it looked like it all caught up with him a touch here , in his eighth tournament in the last ten weeks			1
at the next par three , the 15th , he hit a wicked hook with a five iron you ’d never see him play if he was fresh , and had to play his next from within the confines of a hazard to card another bogey			0
concentration : @entity13 admitted that the missed put on the 12th derailed him slightly the good news for @entity13 is he is still in great shape in terms of the $ 10million ( £ 6.12m ) @entity69 bonus that will be handed out in @entity70 next sunday at the @entity71			1
any player who is in the top five in the @entity69 going into that event has control of their own destiny and @entity13 should be one of those			2
‘ i need to go out and shoot a low one in the final round on sunday and give myself the best possible chance going to @entity70 , ’ he said			0
@entity13 was n’t the only player to suffer on the greens			2
halfway leader @entity83 had problems of his own , missing no fewer than five putts under 5ft in a miserable 72 that has left him seven off the pace			0
instead it is @entity90 champion @entity89 who leads the @entity93 challenge into the final round , as he shot a 64 to stand five behind @entity36 in third place			0
nearest player to the runaway leader is @entity37 @entity98 but even he is three behind			0
given this was @entity36 ’s seventh consecutive round in the 60s – he ’s a combined 26 under for the stretch and was runner - up in the @entity104 last monday – he might take some stopping			0
championship : @entity13 dropped seven places to tenth and is now four - under in the @entity9 tournaments : the @entity109 has already won two major trophies this summer ‘ i ’d have to rate this round as one of the top three of my career , ’ said the temperamental @entity36 , who has one other @entity112 victory to his name			1
‘ i felt like i was in control of all facets of my game all day			0
’ on a day when his supposed dream team of @entity124 and @entity125 pulled out in controversial circumstances , @entity37 @entity122 captain @entity121 will be encouraged that several of his team have the chance to pull off a morale - boosting win going into the final round			0
masters champion @entity132 is four behind , with @entity133 six off the pace , while @entity135 and @entity136 lie joint seventh , albeit eight behind			0
@entity138 shot 70 to be tied 29th , while @entity139 shot 69 , his lowest round of the week , but still remains in tied 49th place .			2

@entity13 missed four - foot put
@entity13 has already won two majors this summer
but @entity109 failed to repair damage at @entity9
@entity13 is tied in 10th place on four - under
