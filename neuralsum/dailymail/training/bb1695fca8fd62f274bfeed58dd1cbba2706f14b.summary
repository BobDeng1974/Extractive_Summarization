by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:59 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 17:36 est , 8 june 2013 training partner : @entity3 regularly visits @entity4 for workouts to keep him focused on athletics as @entity4 awaits his trial for the killing of his lover , @entity11 , another attractive young blonde is constantly at his side			1
but there ’s no danger of athlete @entity3 stepping into tragic model @entity16 ’s shoes – her role with the @entity20 gold medallist known as the ‘ @entity21 ’ is very different			1
her job as double amputee sprinter @entity4 ’s training partner is to keep his mind focused on athletics and not on the case due to be heard in august , following his shooting of 29 - year - old @entity11 on @entity28			1
@entity3 , 24 , a former international 100m and 200m hurdler , is a regular visitor to the @entity31 home of @entity4 ’s uncle @entity32 , where a gym has been built in the pool house			1
the pair train together on a treadmill , bicycle and weights equipment each day , but @entity3 , an old friend of 26 - year - old @entity4 , has told friends she is reporting back regularly to his coach , @entity4 , on the @entity20 ’s state of mind as he tries to rebuild his shattered life			1
‘ @entity3 trains with @entity4 in the morning , often together with his uncle @entity32 ’s family , ’ said a source close to the @entity4 family			1
‘ she ’s a very good friend of @entity4			1
’ @entity3 , who describes herself as ‘ a 100m hurdler and sports scientist ’ , is engaged to business consultant @entity49 , 30			1
she was in @entity51 ’s preparation squad for the @entity52 , but suddenly dropped out , apparently because of personal issues			0
aside from her athletics , she works for her family ’s plant hire business			0
her looks earned her a place in the @entity60 2011 calendar as miss july , where she appeared in a carefully - posed shot wearing only briefs and a medal			0
yesterday her father , @entity65 , told @entity66 that the @entity4 family were closing ranks over @entity4			1
lovers : the @entity70 sprinter with his girlfriend @entity11 two weeks before her death charge : @entity4 has appeared in court charged with his girlfriend 's murder and will go on trial later this year he said : ‘ they know what they are doing			1
they have brought in professional people to help			0
we would prefer to keep everything private			0
’ miss @entity11 ’s mother , june , recently said she was shocked to learn her daughter was in pain after she was shot the first time while in the bathroom during the @entity28 tragedy			2
@entity4 then fired two more bullets into the room , one of which killed her			2
@entity4 told the court at his bail hearing in april that he feared a burglar had broken into his apartment			2
he said he grabbed his gun from the table closest to miss @entity11 ’s side of the bed and began firing			2
@entity102 said last week that his nephew stayed inside most of the time , surrounded by pictures of @entity16			0
‘ he ’s got photos in his room , he ’s got photos all over the place , ’ he said			0
‘ what can you say if the person you love the most dies and you were the instrument – it ’s unthinkable			0
’ these poignant pictures of a young @entity11 offer a rare glimpse into a beautiful life that ended far too early			2
in the first photograph , below left , @entity11 , aged four , is seen with a parcel in the garden of her grandparents ’ house at @entity122 in @entity123 in 1987			0
young beauty : @entity11 aged four ( left ) and in an early modelling shot aged 19 ( right ) star : @entity11 was a model and television presenter the second – an early modelling shot – shows her as a raven - haired 19 - year - old , poised and serene			0
@entity11 went on to work as a model and television presenter , but she had other aspirations before her life was brutally cut short			0
she had already worked as a ‘ paralegal ’ executive and had hoped to become a qualified legal advocate by the age of 30			0
by grim coincidence , @entity4 will appear in court on august 19 , which would have been her 30th birthday .			1

training partner @entity3 , 24 , is helping the athlete maintain *fitness*
@entity4 faces trial in august accused of murder of @entity11
