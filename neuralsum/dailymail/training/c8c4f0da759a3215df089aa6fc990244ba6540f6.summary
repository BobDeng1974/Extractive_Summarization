you grow up being told to keep not to move if you are unfortunate enough to come across snake and they will leave you alone - but for one guy this age - old trick did n't quite go to plan			2
@entity9 , from @entity10 in central west @entity11 , posted a video on his @entity14 page of a one - and - a - half metre snake slithering towards him , when he was only wearing thongs , before it strikes out at his right foot			1
' tried the old stand still trick			0
always show respect and never get too complacent , ' @entity9 commented			2
the video shows the snake slowly approaches @entity9 , who is standing in the @entity21 , and winds around his right ankle before suddenly biting him			1
@entity9 was so shocked ( and probably in pain ) that he kicked the scaly reptile about a metre away as he exclaims ' f * * * ! ' as his thong then fell off his foot onto the ground			1
the footage has gone nuts online with more than 3,000 views and almost 5,500 shares			1

@entity48 described it as : ' this is the best thing i 've ever seen in my life			0
' while @entity53 posted : ' sweet footage mate '			0
