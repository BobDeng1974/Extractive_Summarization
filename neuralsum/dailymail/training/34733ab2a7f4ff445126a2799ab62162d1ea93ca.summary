@entity0 responded to conjecture that he has the brawn , but not the brains , by claiming his 32nd career pole for tomorrow 's @entity5 @entity4			1
the new @entity7 campaign , with its emphasis on fuel and tyre management , is expected to favour the thinking driver , and critics of @entity13 have suggested this could work against him			0
while we 'll yet to see how @entity0 handles the new regulations in race conditions , the early signs in qualifying were promising			2
his timing too was impeccable , crossing the line after both @entity20 in his @entity41 and @entity42 team - mate @entity40 when the track was at its greatest			1
@entity0 now joins compatriot @entity44 on the all - time list for the highest number of pole positions			0
he only needs two more to eclipse the legendary @entity30 as @entity29 's greatest specialist over one lap and four - time world champion @entity50			2
it 's difficult to say what drew a better response from the partisan @entity5 crowd – @entity20 sticking his @entity41 on the front row or @entity56 failing to make it into the top - 10 shootout			1
the @entity60 crowd clearly have n't forgotten @entity56 's sour rivalry with home favourite @entity62 , raucously cheering the @entity65 's early bath from qualifying			1
out of sorts : world champion @entity56 will start tomorrow 's race from 12th on the grid slumping to 13th , @entity56 failed to make it out of @entity72 for the first time since the @entity74 – that 's 28 races			1
his final lap would certainly have been affected by @entity79 's crash – the waving yellow flags forcing him to slow – but the reigning world champion was well off the pace of team - mate @entity20 throughout qualifying			2
there was some consolation for the 26 - year - old after he was bumped up to 12th following @entity89 ' five - place grid drop following a gearbox change			0
thumbs up : @entity20 will start on the front row @entity41 team principal @entity92 sparked much controversy after he claimed that @entity42 would win the @entity5 @entity4 by two laps			1
unsurprisingly , it seems his prediction may have been somewhat premature			0
@entity41 endured a nightmare pre-season , so it is testament to the incredible work done by those at @entity101 in the aftermath of the final test in @entity104 to see @entity20 haul the champions on to the front row			1
and what of the @entity5 himself ? there was some displeasure that @entity41 chose to promote from within instead of hiring @entity79 who ended his two - year spell with @entity22 at the end of last season			0
but @entity20 justified his selection by splitting the @entity115 while in contrast @entity116 were counting the cost of @entity79 's dramatic spin in @entity72			2
the @entity120 will start from 11th oh his @entity116 comeback			0
@entity20 's notorious grin however , will be wider than ever tonight			2
@entity123 and @entity124 will start fourth and eighth respectively after a sterling job from the @entity7 rookies			1
@entity128 's effort is the best from a @entity7 first - timer since @entity0 qualified fourth for the curtain raiser in @entity60 some seven years ago			1
his lap looks all the more impressive when you consider team - mate @entity134 failed to make it out of @entity72			0
rookie delight : @entity138 and @entity123 in his @entity139 ( right ) showed maturity on their debuts @entity124 , who is just 19 - years - old and won last year 's gp3 championship , was born just five days before @entity144 was killed at the 1994 @entity145			1
the three - time world champion , a master of wet conditions , would have doffed his cap to @entity150 's start to life in @entity7			0
@entity22 were victorious at last year 's @entity5 @entity4 after @entity79 stormed to glory in @entity60			0
but the troubled team have zero chance of repeating that feat tomorrow after somewhat of a nightmare on saturday			0
in trouble : the @entity22 of pastor @entity158 failed to post a competitive time in qualifying @entity161 and pastor @entity158 will start 20th and 21st – the latter , a winter arrival from @entity164 , spent much of @entity165 on the grass , failing to complete a single lap. the team somehow managed to see the funny side writing on their @entity171 account : ' it was double points for the last race and reverse grids all season right ? '			0

@entity0 is one shy of @entity30 's record for most poles by a @entity180
crowd revel in @entity56 's troubles as @entity65 qualifies 13th
@entity20 repays @entity41 choice after qualifying on front row
