@entity0 broke a two year old record in the @entity2 on saturday by completing 741 passes in their 3 - 0 victory at @entity5			1
on tuesday night at the @entity7 it was the turn of @entity9 ’s men to be passed off the park			0
beaten at their own game by @entity13 , how about that ? what a lesson this was			2
@entity17 lets fly from 25 yards with a swerving strike that put @entity13 into the lead , although goalkeeper @entity20 should have done better @entity21 made his first start for @entity0 in a competitive game since march 2013 as the injury - prone midfielder was given a chance in the @entity28 tie @entity0 : @entity29 4 ; @entity30 5 ( @entity31 86 ) , @entity32 6.5 , @entity33 5 , @entity34 5 ; @entity35 5 , @entity21 5.5 ( @entity36 67 ) ; @entity37 5.5 ( @entity38 71 ) , @entity39 5 , @entity40 4 ; @entity41 6			1

@entity13 dished it out , deserving winners after a towering performance from @entity54 in the centre of their midfield			2
@entity74 knows how @entity13 clung on to him in the summer when @entity75 were trying to take him to @entity76 , but they did			2
he , like many others in @entity79 ’s team , played like a man possessed			0
meet a @entity13 supporter in the street today and they will stop you in your tracks to tell you about the moment time stood still when @entity17 took a touch 30 yards out			2
it came in the 39th minute , when the score was one - apiece and @entity0 ’s defence failed to chase down the @entity13 defender when they cleared a corner			1
@entity17 took a touch and unleashed a thunderbolt , smashing it beyond @entity20 , making his debut in @entity0 ’s goal , to put @entity13 ahead			1
it has gone down in @entity13 folklore			2
@entity74 knows how @entity17 is consistently overlooked by @entity99 manager @entity98 , but this rocket can only add to the @entity102 glow around the @entity13 right - back			1
@entity79 ’s team exposed @entity0 , playing on their fragile confidence and scarring them with with this thrilling victory			2
even when they fell behind to @entity41 ’s stunning free - kick in the 14th minute , @entity13 did n’t panic			1
what a quality to have			0
@entity41 , pulling his shorts up so tight they looked like a pair of budgie smugglers before he took the free - kick , pinged it off his right book and into the top corner			1
@entity0 fielded a young defence , @entity33 one of three 19 - year - olds in the back four , alongside @entity121 , @entity30 and 23 - year - old @entity34 @entity54 stops @entity124 's @entity123 star @entity122 in his tracks as @entity0 started brightly in an @entity7 that was n't quite full @entity41 strikes a beauty of a free - kick over the @entity13 wall and beyond the reach of goalkeeper @entity48 to put @entity0 ahead the @entity132 star celebrates scoring his fourth goal since arriving at @entity0 from @entity134 in the summer after his sumptuous free - kick had opened the scoring @entity41 is fast becoming a firm favourite among the @entity0 fans , and has scored in his last three games at the @entity7 ‘ 1 - 0 to the @entity0 ’ sang a hesitant @entity7 crowd , almost full to the rafters after selling tickets to their young supporters for a tenner a pop. the lead did n’t last long			1
@entity35 , captaining @entity0 in the absence of @entity148 , gave away a penalty when he clipped the legs of @entity13 debutant @entity55			1
@entity57 scored , his first in a @entity13 shirt , with a spot kick drilled straight down the centre of @entity20 ’s goal			1
the @entity0 keeper moved way too early			0
with @entity54 bossing it in the centre of the park , @entity0 ’s midfield was muffled			2
@entity35 , @entity39 and @entity21 , returning from a long spell out through injury , were miles off the pace			2
it is difficult to even try to explain what @entity40 was doing out on the left for @entity0 , other than to say he was disinterested			0
he should n’t play for this club , not if he is going to disrespect the red shirt like this			0
there is also no place in the game for @entity41 , possibly the only player who looked capable of doing something to bring @entity0 back into the tie , waving an imaginary yellow card at the referee			1
@entity35 captained @entity0 on his first start of the season but gave away a penalty when he made a silly tackle on @entity13 debutant @entity55 @entity57 converted from the spot to put @entity13 level , going down the middle of the goal to beat @entity0 's new goalkeeper @entity20 @entity57 acknowledges the travelling @entity13 fans after his well - taken spot - kick had cancelled out @entity41 's free - kick at the @entity7 @entity39 passes the ball away from a @entity55 tackle			1
the @entity99 star was part of a strong attacking line - up fielded by @entity9 there was no need for the gesture when @entity53 brought him down			0
the @entity13 midfielder was going into @entity67 ’s book come what may			0
this was a pedestrian @entity0 performance , lacking vigour and struggling to make an impression on this tie after @entity57 ’s equaliser from the penalty spot			1
in @entity121 , @entity33 , @entity209 and @entity30 , @entity0 fielded an inexperienced defence , but that is not to excuse them			0
they played because @entity9 believes they are ready			0
@entity17 celebrates his goal with @entity56 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) after his thunderous strike had put @entity13 into the lead for the first time @entity20 looks shellshocked after conceding the second goal on his @entity0 debut , a the strike moved in the air but went in the middle of the goal , over his head @entity9 shows his nerves as his side went in behind at half time despite having taken the lead at home to @entity13 @entity32 , signed from @entity13 in the summer , remains on course to become a top class player at this level			1
he does n’t have the experience yet to guide this team through difficult times			0
@entity13 are hot , sitting pretty in second place in the @entity2 and proof that there is life beyond @entity238			0
@entity79 did a proper number on @entity0 , fielding a near full strength team and taking advantage of the hesitancy that shows on the faces of @entity9 ’s players in times of distress			0
@entity55 was impressive on his @entity13 debut , battling hard as @entity13 dominated the midfield against another lightweight @entity0 performance @entity48 made some good saves in the @entity13 goal but in truth he was not tested enough by an @entity0 side with plenty of attacking talent @entity0 had enough experience to call on , with @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity39 and @entity35 providing emotional support for some of the younger players			1
sadly these kids struggled to make an impact , unable to muster enough courage and good fortune to bring @entity0 back into the tie			2
@entity9 sent for @entity38 and @entity36 to save them from the substitutes ’ bench , but by then it all felt too late			0
sadly for @entity0 this one passed them by			0
despite taking over a depleted squad after summer sales , @entity79 is doing a fantastic job with @entity13 as he showed again on tuesday night @entity55 strikes away from young right back @entity30 as @entity0 failed to get a hold of the game in the middle of the park against the high - flying @entity13 @entity58 holds off young @entity99 defender @entity121 as @entity13 got the better of @entity0 's inexperienced defence one positive for @entity0 was that @entity21 managed 67 minutes before being replaced by @entity36 , and the @entity282 appeared injury free			1

@entity41 puts @entity285 1 - 0 up with superb free - kick after 14 minutes
@entity57 levels from the spot six minutes later after @entity35 fouls debutant @entity55
@entity17 makes it 2 - 1 to @entity13 with a swerving strike from outside the box in the 40th minute
@entity21 makes his first start for @entity0 since march 2013 in @entity28 tie
@entity20 handed his @entity0 debut in goal
@entity13 pick a strong side and dominated the midfield battle against the @entity285
