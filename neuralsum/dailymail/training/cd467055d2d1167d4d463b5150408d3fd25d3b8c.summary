by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 08:55 est , 2 august 2012 @entity1 , one of @entity3 's strong podium hopefuls , has moved within one match of securing at least a silver medal at the @entity6 after dismantling @entity8 @entity7 in today 's quarter - final			1
the @entity10 - who lost only a month ago in the @entity12 final to @entity13 - is desperate to earn a gold medal at the @entity6 after his plucky defeat at @entity16 , and must progress through the semi-final and the final to fulfill his dream			1
@entity21 's @entity20 or @entity23 's @entity22 await the @entity10 now , and he could meet world @entity24 in the final			1
winner : @entity1 progressed to the semi-finals with ease easy : @entity1 must expect tougher opposition if he is to get the elusive @entity6 gold being cheered on by the @entity34 and @entity35 , his mother , @entity32 , and girlfriend @entity33 - the @entity10 sought to take the game to his opponent			1
@entity1 was out of the blocks flying , and was a break up after @entity7 's third service game , breaking the @entity8 to love			2
the @entity8 scuppered his chances to get back into the game by double - faulting , handing the @entity3 player the initiative , and @entity1 dominated the opening set from there on , as @entity7 appeared to be struggling with a shoulder injury			1
before the match @entity1 was a strong favourite to win against @entity7 , who is ranked 10th in the @entity51 tour , and the @entity8 looked out of sorts against the @entity3 player			1
@entity53 of @entity54 and prince @entity55 were at the match to cheer on @entity1 the @entity34 and @entity35 were keen to show their support for @entity1 by getting involved in the @entity58 wave thank heavens for that : @entity1 did his signature salute to the skies after winning against @entity7 @entity64 's no 1 fought back in the last round to see off old foe @entity67 @entity66 in three sets after a tense encounter			1
the 26 - year - old had to turn the match on its head after going a set down to the wily @entity75			0
but @entity7 provided no such resistance			0
after a routine first set , which @entity1 took 6 - 4 , the @entity8 appeared to be suffering further with his shoulder			1
a brief encounter : the @entity34 and @entity35 saw @entity1 beat his opponent in under an hour @entity7 seemed to suffer with a shoulder complaint after the first set @entity1 did not let up on the world no 10 , and hammered him in the second set 6 - 1 after breaking to love in the first game			1
after winning he threw his wrist bands in the air , and roared before his signature salute to the skies before leaving the court , proving just how much an @entity6 podium place would mean to him			0
the @entity92 has an unbelievably busy @entity6 schedule , as he is due to partner up with @entity94 in the mixed - doubles , and if he wants to get on the podium twice , he must play two more singles matches and four mixed doubles matches before sunday			1
come on @entity1 ! fans gather on @entity100 ( or @entity100 ) to show their support for the @entity3 star sea of colour : the @entity105 turned up to watch the action unfold on centre court making her way down : @entity53 of @entity54 makes her way through the crowd to get to her seats as @entity55 follows closely behind the pair were handed a wildcard entry into the @entity6 yesterday , and regardless what happens in the match with @entity7 , will be on centre court this evening			1
after his tearful @entity12 final defeat to @entity13 , @entity1 is on course to take an @entity6 medal one way or the other			2
but with @entity20 or @entity22 lying in wait , it will still be tough for the @entity10 to achieve gold or silver			2
@entity13 meanwhile must make his way through @entity128 @entity127 later today			0
although many of the big names - @entity127 , @entity22 , @entity20 and @entity13 - may stand in @entity1 's way , current @entity6 champion @entity129 was ruled out with a knee injury			2
but @entity105 fans should be thankful that @entity129 was ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury he sustained in the @entity137			0
the @entity8 was due to bear the flag for his nation in the opening ceremony , but struggled to overcome the injury he sustained on his way to winning the @entity137			0
@entity55 and @entity35 arrived at court one shortly before play got under way in the third seed 's quarter final match against @entity148 's @entity7			2
eyes for each other : @entity55 and @entity35 seemed distracted as they chatted between points in the match ouch : @entity7 seemed to be suffering from a shoulder strain as he succumbed to defeat by @entity1 @entity35 , wearing a royal blue dress , navy blazer and dark glasses , smiled as the crowd greeted the couple with a round of applause as they took their seats in the stand			2
@entity55 , also wearing a navy blazer , chatted to spectators sitting nearby			0
@entity1 was given an even greater reception as the match began , with the partisan crowd waving @entity172 flags and roaring at every point he won			0
the couple clapped enthusiastically as @entity1 took the lead in the first set , while support for the 25 - year - old @entity179 finalist also came from his mother @entity180 and girlfriend @entity33			0
the tennis is the latest in a number of @entity6 events attended by @entity184 , who earlier this week visited the athletes ' village to meet members of @entity3 full house : although there were a few empty seats at the beginning of the contest , the stands soon filled up the @entity34 and @entity35 looked relaxed as they chatted to each other between the points , and seemed happy to join in the fun with the crowd , taking part in the @entity58 waves which spread around the stands during the change - overs			1
the couple rose to their feet when @entity1 clinched victory and were given another round of applause as they left the stands , while @entity1 walked off the court to deafening cheers			0
despite the crowd 's enthusiasm for the @entity105 number one 's @entity6 bid , there were still rows of empty seats in the stands , particularly in the lower tiers			0
hundreds of fans visiting the @entity222 without tickets to the match gathered outside the court on @entity100 to watch the action on the big screen .			0

@entity64 's no 1 tennis player wins 6 - 4 6 - 1 against @entity7 in quarter - final of games
@entity1 now two matches away from gold medal , and stands in good stead to achieve at least bronze
@entity34 and @entity35 witness action unfold , but match does *n't* even last an hour
@entity20 or @entity22 await @entity3 player , as the @entity10 will partner @entity94 in the mixed doubles this evening
