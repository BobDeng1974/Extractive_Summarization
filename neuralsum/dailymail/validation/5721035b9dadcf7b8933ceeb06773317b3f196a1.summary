the devastated family of a 29 - year - old @entity2 woman who died after undergoing ‘ simple ’ cosmetic surgery in @entity4 are desperately trying to find what happened to their ‘ beautiful and gracious ’ loved one			1
@entity7 was admitted to a hospital in @entity9 , the capital city of the @entity4 state of @entity11 , on march 20 while on holiday with her boyfriend			1
she died on the same day , after reportedly suffering a heart attack			1
her distraught family are at a loss to understand why she could not be saved			1

they have also urged other woman not to ' risk death to improve on perfection '			1
@entity37 woman @entity7 has died in a @entity4 hospital after undergoing surgery ‘ the autopsy showed @entity43 went into cardiac arrest following surgery			1
the hospitals ' only response was to cling to their waiver , removing themselves from any liability , ’ a family member wrote on the @entity28 group			2
‘ there have been no answers and their only offer of “ cooperation ” was an urgency to return her to us in the form of ashes			2
the @entity2 @entity56 has strongly advised we do not allow this to happen			2
’ ms @entity26 ’s family have been advised to travel to @entity4 as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy – not carried out by the hospital where she died – and to bring her home			1
they say she ' did not have travel insurance and we were never prepared for a situation of this magnitude '			2
‘ @entity70 as we knew her on earth would be devastated at the amount of attention she is receiving at the moment , as she was extremely private and worked very hard to never be a burden on anybody , ’ her family wrote			2
‘ however the abundance of love that we all hold for her is propelling the action that needs to be taken before she be laid to rest , and she deserves that			2
’ a @entity28 tribute page has been set up for @entity70 to share advice and support and to help fundraise to bring her body home to @entity2 one friend on @entity28 described @entity43 as a ' shining light in the dark and unforgiving world ' her family are also asking for help in gaining legal and medical representation as advised by @entity56			1
ms @entity26 ’s family have not said what procedure @entity70 was undergoing before she died but they explained : ‘ as beautiful as @entity70 was inside and out			1
she was still filled with certain inadequacies			0
as almost every woman on earth does			2
’ ‘ her perfect and whole soul was not strong enough in light of a world that constantly bombarded her with an urgency to demand more from herself and her body , ’ they explained			2
‘ she never demanded anything from anybody , but was always out giving her people			0
these near perfect graphic comparisons our young women are bombarded with from get go are too much for innocent hearts to battle , and the consequences are fatal when not conducted by adequate professionals			0
ms @entity26 ’s family have been advised to travel to @entity4 as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy ‘ these doctors promised her more perfection to fill an emptiness that began developing early in our childhood			1
this emptiness further expanded with traumatic experiences in her adult life and the constant social boarding of a false beauty illusion , ’ they @entity28 post continued			0
her sister @entity128 has urged others not too risk their lives in the pursuit of what they perceive as beauty			1
‘ this was not the way to go home , no woman should risk death to improve on perfection , ’ they said			1
‘ tomorrow morning when you look in the mirror say to yourself " i am enough , i am worthy , i am perfect just the way i am "			0
‘ do n't listen to a world that is hungry to fill your insecurities with poison			0
stop feeding an industry that hates humans , especially women in the natural state and their perfect birth bodies			0
do it for @entity43 , do it for you			0
’ tributes have poured in for the 29 - year - old			2
one friend wrote ' she was such a gorgeous girl physically and emotionally ' friends have promised to help bring @entity70 , ' a truly beautiful soul ' , home anyway they can there has been an outpouring of love and messages of condolences on the page set up to remember ms @entity7			1
