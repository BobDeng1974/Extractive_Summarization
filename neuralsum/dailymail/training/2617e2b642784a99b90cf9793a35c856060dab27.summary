in the final year of the @entity104 , @entity103 coach @entity102 won the one major bowl that had eluded him , and proved a point about parity in the process			2
after taking the past month to cultivate a young quarterback who was still coming into his own , @entity102 brought a confident and motivated @entity103 squad to the @entity8			1
freshman @entity111 completed a @entity8 - record 32 passes for 348 yards and four touchdowns for 11th - ranked @entity18 , outshining @entity114 runner - up @entity3			1
