by @entity0 published : 18:34 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 18 september 2012 a plan to merge giant @entity3 defence firm @entity2 with a @entity5 rival ran into major trouble yesterday			1
mps , shareholders and military experts said the £ 30billion deal with @entity11 might jeopardise jobs as well as national security			1
politicians from both sides of the house called for hearings into the merger , which would create the largest arms firm in the world			1
concerns : @entity22 , left , said the merger undervalued the defence firm and admiral @entity25 , right , warned that the ‘ special relationship ’ with the @entity28 on military matters could come under threat @entity2 - manufactured @entity31 aircraft			1
concerns have been raised over whether the company 's reputation for cutting - edge technology could be under threat the government has a ‘ golden share ’ in @entity2 , which it can use to block the merger on a temporary basis			1
@entity42 mp @entity41 said ministers should use this option if the @entity46 and @entity47 governments do not give up their large ownership stakes in @entity11			1
‘ it ca n’t be that a @entity3 company , that stands alone , is bought by a @entity46 and @entity47 government company , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s naïve to think that the socialist @entity46 government wo n’t interfere with the company			0
when that happens , poor old @entity3 workers will get hammered			0
’ fellow @entity42 @entity57 said : ‘ i can see in ten years ’ time , when the crunch comes again as they always do , that it will be very easy for the @entity46 - @entity47 majority to say they ’re going to gradually pull away and support their own industries			0
’ he also raised concerns about whether @entity2 ’s reputation for cutting - edge technology could be under threat			0
trident : the missile is a @entity28 - @entity3 project ‘ there ’s a concern about the quality of their management , ’ he said			0
‘ for all the efficiency that the @entity47 are supposed to bring , i ’m not sure that has been reflected			0
’ the merger has raised fears that the new company , which will be 60 per cent owned by existing @entity11 shareholders , would shift skilled jobs overseas			1
@entity22 , of @entity84 , which has a large stake in @entity2 , said it was ‘ not really clear to me as a shareholder why they ’ve chosen to do the deal ’			2
he said the merger undervalued the defence firm that was formed in 1999 by the combination of @entity93 and @entity94			1
one well - placed source , speaking on condition of anonymity , said three of @entity2 ’s top five shareholders , including its largest investor @entity100 with 13 per cent of the company , were not in favour of the merger			1
that would be sufficient to block the deal , regardless of political intervention			2
admiral @entity25 , the former @entity107 , warned that the ‘ special relationship ’ with the @entity28 on military matters could come under threat			2
‘ i have concerns about @entity28 exchange of information with us , ’ he said			0
‘ we are joined at the hips with the @entity28 on nuclear submarines			0
i just can not see the @entity28 being happy about it			0
’ mps on the defence select committee are expected to agree today that defence secretary @entity120 should be called to give evidence in a hearing , alongside @entity2 and @entity11 executives @entity125 mp @entity124 said : ‘ it ’s not a matter purely for the two companies , i hope the minister of defence will give evidence			1
the government has got to have a view			0
‘ my understanding is that the @entity28 are not enthusiastic			0
it ’s clear that there are a number of programmes where we share intellectual property , not least the nuclear deterrent			0
’ @entity140 , a @entity42 defence minister until the reshuffle earlier this month , said the deal might have to be delayed given @entity118 ’ doubts			2
‘ the future of @entity2 is critical to our economic and security interests , ’ he said , adding that an october 10 deadline for the two firms to flesh out their proposal was unlikely to be met			2
‘ @entity150 will want to be satisfied on some of these issues , ’ he added			0
‘ given that it goes to the heart of our national security , given that there are national sovereignty concerns at stake , we need to know some of the detail			1
’ @entity2 is building the new generation of @entity161 nuclear missiles and the @entity163 nuclear - powered submarine , and has argued that key projects would be ‘ ringfenced ’ from the rest of the company			0
mps for constituencies where some of @entity2 ’s 35,000 @entity3 employees work met yesterday to discuss how to prevent jobs being lost			1
@entity11 , which employs 17,000 in @entity3 , is understood to have argued that these jobs will be safer if it merges with @entity2 , because it would reverse plans to move factories that make wings for @entity177 planes to @entity178 .			1
