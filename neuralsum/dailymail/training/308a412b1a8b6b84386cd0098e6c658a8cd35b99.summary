by @entity0 former @entity2 mayor @entity1 was sentenced wednesday to 10 years in prison for bribery , money laundering and other corruption that spanned his two terms as mayor — including the chaotic years after @entity9 hit in 2005			1
@entity11 district judge @entity10 handed down the sentence wednesday morning			1
@entity1 was convicted february 12 of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars from businessmen who wanted work from the city or @entity1 's support for various projects			1
the 58 - year - old @entity34 had defiantly denied any wrongdoing after his 2013 indictment and during his february trial			0
@entity1 was a political newcomer when he won election as @entity2 ' mayor , succeeding @entity40 in 2002			2
he cast himself as a reformer and announced crackdowns on corruption in the city 's automobile - inspection and taxi - permit programs			0
but federal prosecutors say his own corrupt acts began during his first term , continued through the @entity9 catastrophe and flourished in his second term			2
until his indictment in 2013 , he was perhaps best known for a widely heard radio interview in which he angrily , and sometimes profanely , asked for stepped - up federal response in the days after levee breaches flooded most of the city during @entity9			2
he also drew notoriety for impolitic remarks , such as the racially charged ‘ @entity2 will be chocolate again ’ and his comment that a growing violent crime problem ‘ keeps the @entity2 brand out there			0
’ then : elected in 2002 with strong support from the business community and white voters , @entity1 won re-election in 2006 with a campaign that sometimes played on fears among black voters that they were being left out of the city 's spotty recovery a @entity2 neighborhood destroyed by @entity9 is shown in this 11 september 2005 photo			1
many of @entity1 's misdeeds occurred as the stricken city struggled to re-emerge from the rubble of @entity9 elected in 2002 with strong support from the business community and white voters , @entity1 won re-election in 2006 with a campaign that sometimes played on fears among black voters that they were being left out of the city 's spotty recovery			1
he was limited by law to two consecutive terms but a third term would have been unlikely , giving plunging approval ratings and the stricken city 's continued recovery struggles			0
he was succeeded in 2010 by @entity88			0
most government pre-sentence reports and recommendations were not made public but a filing by @entity92 ahead of the sentencing hearing indicated prosecutors were pushing for a sentence of 20 years or more under federal sentencing guidelines			0
defense attorney @entity92 said that would amount to a virtual life sentence for the former mayor			0
@entity92 said @entity1 's family needs him , there is no danger of @entity1 committing more crimes and that the crimes for which @entity1 was convicted constituted an aberration from an otherwise model life			1
prosecutors said the schemes that led to @entity1 's conviction included two family members : his two grown sons were never charged with a crime but they were part of the family business that received free granite from a contractor			1
they also said that what @entity92 calls an ‘ aberration ’ was behavior that spanned six years and involved multiple contractors .			0

@entity1 , 58 , received the sentence for bribery , money laundering and other corruption on wednesday
the crimes spanned his two terms , including the chaotic years following @entity9
the bribes came in the form of money , free vacations and truckloads of free granite for his family business
