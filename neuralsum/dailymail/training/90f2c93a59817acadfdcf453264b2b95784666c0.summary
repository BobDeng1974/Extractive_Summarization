by @entity1 reporter despite all the hype surrounding this year ’s high - brow best - seller , @entity5 by left - wing @entity7 economist @entity6 , a survey has revealed that more than a quarter of those who picked up the 685 - page tome never got past page 26 , and only just over 2 per cent of readers finished it			1
@entity15 ’s memoir scored even lower , according to @entity17 professor @entity16 , who conducted an analysis of @entity20 ebooks using a method of calculation he called @entity23 — named after @entity24 , author of @entity26 , which has been called the most unread book of all time			1
here , we asked five writers to confess to the books they have failed to finish			1
@entity33 feels guilty about not finishing @entity35 's @entity34 , which won the @entity36 @entity33 , novelist the book i feel guiltiest about not finishing is @entity35 ’s @entity34 , which began her phenomenal success in winning the @entity36 for two novels in succession			1
as a big fan of her early work and her doughty yet kindly personality , i was hoping it would be her breakthrough			1
to my horror , though , i found it to be a novel i had a kind of allergic reaction to			2
i admit to having difficulties with serious historical fiction set beyond living memory anyway			2
( like everyone , i adore the toshy sort when on holiday			2
) unless they genuinely break new ground , my view is that it ’s better to read a biography or the literature of the time			1
at least you ’d be closer to the truth — as far as we can ever know it			2
@entity71 ’s hero is @entity72 , whose rise from blacksmith ’s son to the second most powerful man in the court of @entity78 is largely unexplained			2
again and again , i kept trying to read the novel , which most of my friends were raving about , but kept foundering on its jarring use of the historic present			2
the emotions were muted ; the dialogue unconvincingly modern and i could n’t care less about any of the characters			2
friends and fellow authors seemed hypnotised by @entity71 ’s own life - story , and accused me of being envious			1
far from it — i longed to join the happy throng , but i was n’t prepared to lie about having got beyond page 56			2
i tried every technique : dipping in and out , skipping to the end , on four - hour train journeys , 12 - hour aeroplane journeys			1
the only thing worse was @entity99 ’s monumentally pretentious @entity98			2
however , @entity98 reduces me to quivering rage rather than the baffled state of wistful somnolence brought on by @entity34			1
it remains a sovereign cure for insomnia			2
@entity105 are among the books that @entity107 faltered with @entity107 , @entity108 presenter my father has only one vice			2
a non-smoking , non-drinking squash player who got an enviable degree from @entity116 and preaches occasionally at the local church , @entity112 does not appear at first glance to lead a dissolute life			2
but look more closely at the books on his shelves and you will notice a disturbing thing			2
each of them has a bookmark in			2
each has been abandoned at roughly the same point			2
as a young boy , i saw my father get into terrible trouble with @entity131 , the colossal work by @entity133 which famously has 71 chapters and footnotes in @entity136			2
an ardent reader , @entity112 had completed all three volumes of @entity140 ’s @entity139 , and now ambitiously set about tackling @entity133			2
he began when i was 11			2
by the time i went to university , he was on chapter three			1
as a result , i made myself the quiet promise that i would never give up on a book , no matter how tiresome it became			1
my rule held for 20 years			0
but then @entity153 show - off @entity151 ’s @entity150 did to me what the @entity154 did to my dad			1
the book expected me to care about a murdering monk — all the while throwing gratuitous literary references at me			1
since then i have faltered with others : @entity163 ’s time - travelling romp @entity164 ; @entity166 ’s @entity165 ( has anyone read that ? ) ; @entity169 ( the novel by the @entity173 - winning @entity172 author @entity171 ; and @entity174 , by @entity175 ( the cover frightened people on a family holiday )			1
@entity166 's classic @entity179 left @entity180 feeling cold			1
he 's resolved to read it now @entity180 , comedian i am stuck on @entity179			1
i managed quite a lot of the close print and descriptions of horse - races			1
it was n’t the long silly names or the trains that defeated me , it was time itself			1
the failure to persevere past @entity166 ’s first 400 pages was a combination of circumstances , whimsicality and bulk			0
the circumstances have to do with a slight lax period about three years ago , when i had a summer gap between two of my tv projects — @entity201 and a @entity202 — a hot day , a hammock , time on my hands			1
i decided that a big book with big themes could be my summer companion			1
and i reached for the great looming brick of words			0
apparently , as the introduction told me , everyone can remember when they first surrendered to the power of the hypnotic @entity215 romance , and the long days that it took them over and changed their attitudes			0
except in my case , the book is still in the pile by my bed and , clue here , it has dust on it			1
that ’s a bad sign			0
it has been there some time , with a dog - ear on a page about half - way through			1
frankly , the thing is the size of a loaf of bread			0
it is not something you can stuff down your trousers in meetings			0
or carry about on the tube			0
that ’s the trouble with it			0
i have got a kindle now			0
indeed , it ’s amazing the number of unfinished books you can put on your @entity20			0
and i have downloaded @entity179 in a different translation			1
i remember that , at first , i loved the idea of @entity179 : her passion and high - necked blouses and the dashing cavalry stuff and the worthy farmer and all			1
but one of the problems with reading the book at 60 years of age is that i now have too much sympathy with the supposedly dull husband and the children — and not the beautiful , heavy - breathing woman			1
mind you , writing this , i ’ve resolved to finish it			1
in fact , i think i will go and get it from my bedside table			0
first though , i just have to read these six or seven books about @entity273 , where i am headed next			0
@entity274 hated @entity276 's a @entity275 , which she had to read in university @entity274 , @entity278 presenter @entity276 ’s @entity275 ( in @entity281 ) — all 3,000 pages of it — was on my reading list at university as part of my degree in @entity7 and @entity286			1
i was n’t sure i ’d even be able to carry it home			0
it ’s what ’s known , literally and metaphorically , as a weighty tome			0
it ’s made up of seven volumes and is loved and hated in equal measure			0
i began it in @entity7 , quickly bought an @entity297 translation , but soon found the long , tortuous sentences just as difficult to get a grip on in my mother tongue			0
and then , on and on @entity276 went about the making of a cup of tea and the scent of the madeleine ( a little @entity7 cake ) as he dipped it into the tea			0
( ‘ a disgusting habit , ’ my mother would have said			0
) i got to around page 70 before abandoning the task and took the advice of a fellow student who ’d found a @entity315 ’s guide to @entity276 and assured me : ‘ all you need to know is he was closet gay , adored his mother , suffered from asthma and is obsessed with how smells and stuff evoke memory			0
’ i took him at his word and got through the exam without too much disgrace			0
i was only 19 and it ’s no wonder that i told myself life was too short to be bothered with a book that totally failed to inspire me			1
for years after , it winked at me from the bookshelf — challenging me to have another go			0
indeed , i tried it again soon after my 60th birthday , but did n’t get as far as i had first time around			1
life now was definitely too short			0
@entity338 ca n't stand celebrity memoirs , including those by @entity341 and @entity342 @entity338 , @entity1 book critic the shelves in @entity345 shops are clogged with books that people have given up on			1
they include ‘ humorous ’ books by @entity350 and @entity351 , and all those paperbacks purchased at the airport before the annual fortnight on the beach , or hardbacks exchanged by relatives at @entity358 and discarded by @entity359			0
among them are the ghosted memoirs of so - called celebrities such as @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity363 and @entity364			1
these are the books , too , that i ’ve never managed to finish			1
i know my way round @entity368			0
but celebrity memoirs are anathema			0
i throw them away in exasperation			0
the annoying thing about the autobiographies of , say , comedians @entity374 or @entity376 , is that they come packaged as confessional and candid , but tell us nothing			0
entire marriages are often edited out			0
the boring descriptions of @entity383 or @entity384 childhoods are interchangeable			0
there are always lame stories about eccentric school dinner - ladies , watching @entity389 on the box , appearances in school plays , stints at provincial universities , early auditions			1
above all , money is unmentioned			0
i ’d love to know what the sods earn and who they are really having sex with			0
@entity400 told me that in the early volumes of his memoirs , when discussing his childhood , he would change names , improve events , operate as a novelist			0
but now that his life - story has reached more or less the present - day , he is inhibited			1
he has to be nice to fellow luvvies			0
unless a person is conveniently dead , such as the comedians @entity412 or @entity414 , celebrities ca n’t be completely honest about other celebrities in case they sue			0
which makes publishing an autobiography absolutely pointless , and in my view they are n’t books but press releases			0
against my better judgment , i start them — but never finish a single one .			1

only 2 *%* of readers finish @entity6 's best - seller @entity5
@entity24 's @entity26 has been called most unread book of all time
