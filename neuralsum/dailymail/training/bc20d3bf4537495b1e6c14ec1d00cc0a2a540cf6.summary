but they are rarely found with their original contents			0
experts said the one discovered on @entity27 may have been better preserved because it is the only known example set within a peat mound			2
the cist was first discovered more than ten years ago when what appeared to be its end stone fell out of the peat mound which had been concealing it			1
after several attempts to protect the cist - a scheduled monument - the decision was taken by @entity45 and @entity46 to excavate it in order to recover any surviving archaeological and environmental information before it is destroyed			2
the excavation , which took place in august , was the first excavation of a @entity1 cist for nearly 100 years and involved experts from @entity55 's historic environment projects team , with assistance from @entity46 and specialists from the @entity58			1

now , under the expert eyes of @entity70 's conservation service the items are being x-rayed to see what secrets they may be hiding			0
senior conservator @entity73 took the objects to the spinal unit at @entity17 , in @entity70			0
a preliminary x-ray revealed the contents of a woven bag found on the site , which will now also be examined			0
ms @entity73 said : ‘ the level of preservation of the objects within the cist burial is excellent with a number of different materials present			2
‘ we have a real opportunity to research these finds and potentially discover more about the individual buried there			0
’ the excavation in august 2011 revealed that cremated human bone and burnt textile was placed within an animal hide or with fur on top			2
archaeologists also found a delicate woven bag or basket with fine stitching still visible and containing preserved shale disc beads , amber spherical beads and a circular textile band			0
