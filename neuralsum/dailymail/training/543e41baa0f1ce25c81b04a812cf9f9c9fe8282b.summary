by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 could once count influential academic @entity3 as an ally , but the @entity6 professor has become utterly disillusioned with the @entity8 leader , labelling him as a ‘ counterfeit president ’			1
what ’s more , that comment is just the tip of the iceberg , with professor @entity3 - who lectures in @entity14 - also criticising mr @entity2 ’s policies on @entity16 , drones , national security and his response to the @entity21 shooting			1
@entity3 explains that he was hopeful for the future when mr @entity2 came to power in 2005 , but now believes the optimism was misplaced			1
he posed as if he was a kind of @entity35 … a progressive			0
he turned out to be counterfeit			0
‘ we ended up with a @entity16 presidency , a drone presidency , a national security presidency			0
the @entity16 executives go free			0
the war crimes in the @entity45 , especially now in @entity43 , the war criminals go free			0
’ during mr @entity3 ’s savage attack he dismisses mr @entity2 as a ‘ neoliberal centrist with a smile and nice rhetorical flair … a brown - faced @entity50 ’			1
disgust : @entity3 described @entity2 as a ‘ neoliberal centrist with a smile and with a nice rhetorical flair … a brown - faced @entity50 ' the academic believes that arbitrary police power is one of the problems in @entity58 – and is dismayed that mr @entity2 has not stepped forward to tackle it head on			1
he said : ‘ it has been going on for a long time			0
the @entity2 administration has been silent			2
’ furthermore , he is incredulous , the interview reveals , that mr @entity2 sent a letter of condolence to @entity65 before sending one to the @entity21 family			2
mr @entity3 believes that @entity2 has been far too preoccupied with occupying the middle ground instead of championing bold policies			1
he added : ‘ he does n’t realize that a great leader , a statesperson , does n’t just occupy middle ground			2
they occupy higher ground or the moral ground or even sometimes the holy ground			0
but the middle ground is not the place to go if you ’re going to show courage and vision			2

@entity3 said @entity2 is ' a neoliberal centrist with a smile and rhetorical flair '
he says @entity2 has been too preoccupied with occupying the middle ground
the professor also rails against @entity2 *'s* *handling* of the @entity58 shooting
