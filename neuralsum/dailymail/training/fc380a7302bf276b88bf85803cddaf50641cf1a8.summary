the pilot of the @entity3 plane which crashed into the @entity4 killing 162 people was out of his seat at the moment the plane stalled and was unable to stop the crash , sources have said			1
two people close to the crash investigation said captain @entity12 had gone to disconnect the faulty @entity13 at the time of the accident leaving co-pilot @entity16 in control			1
investigators believe the computer malfunctioned during the flight , but instead of resetting it , the pilot climbed out of his seat and disconnected it from a circuit breaker located behind the co-pilot			1
by the time he got back , the plane was plunging into the ocean , according crash investigation sources during the few moments @entity12 was out of his seat the co-pilot lost control			1
the plane climbed sharply , before either stalling or losing thrust , then fell almost straight down into the ocean below			2
by the time @entity12 had managed to get back to his seat it was too late to save the aircraft			1
the @entity13 limits the movement of the plane , preventing pilots for pulling dangerous manouvres , rather like an electronic speed limiter in a car			2
one man familiar with the case said mr @entity12 had flown in the same @entity49 several days before the crash and was aware the device intermittently turned itself off			1
but even if the device had turned itself off it would not immediately affect the path of the aircraft			2
an @entity49 pilot , who did not wish to be named , said the device could be reset using a button on the dashboard , and struggled to explain why mr @entity12 would have felt it necessary to leave his seat			1
he said : ' to cut all power to it is very unusual			2
you do n't pull the circuit breaker unless it was an absolute emergency			0
i do n't know if there was one in this case , but it is very unusual			0
' @entity70 plunged into the sea during a flight between @entity73 , @entity74 , to @entity75 on december 28 killing everyone on board			0
moments before the crash the pilot radioed air traffic control to report a storm ahead and asked to be allowed to climb above it , but was told the airspace was too busy			1
the @entity49 climbed suddenly before falling almost directly down into the @entity4 , killing all 162 people on board			1
rescue workers are still pulling the wreckage from the ocean ( pictured ) the aircraft 's black box recorders have now been recovered from the seabed and are being examined for any clues they might hold on the plane 's last moments			2
@entity3 said it would not comment while the matter was under investigation by the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) of @entity74			0
the @entity98 has said it is too early to say what role either human factors or equipment may have played in the crash , which is still being investigated			0
the head of the investigation , @entity104 , told reporters this week it was too early to say whether the accident involved pilot error or a mechanical fault			0
the @entity98 said on thursday the jet was in sound condition and all crew members were properly certified			0
lawyers for the family of the @entity116 co-pilot say they have filed a lawsuit against @entity3 in @entity118 for ' endangering the lives of others ' by flying the route without official authorisation on that day			0
investigators have said the accident was not related to the permit issue			0
@entity3 did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit .			0

captain @entity12 went to turn off faulty computer , say crash investigators
this would have meant pilots took manual control of the @entity49
by the time @entity136 got back to his seat aircraft was plunging into ocean
*experts* say turning off *system* manually is a ' *highly* unusual move '
