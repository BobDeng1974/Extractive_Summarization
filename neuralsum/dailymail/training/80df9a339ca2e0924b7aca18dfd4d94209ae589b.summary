by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:21 pm on 20th january 2012 @entity3 's beleaguered retail sector saw slight respite last month as sales grew 0.6 per cent , but experts warned shoppers are set to ' close their wallets and hunker down ' after their pre-christmas splurge			2
retail sales volumes grew 0.6 % month - on - month in december , the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) said , compared to a revised 0.5 % decline the previous month			2
this was slightly below the 0.7 % growth forecast by the @entity15			0
the figure boosted hopes that the total economy would avoid contraction in the last months of 2011 but economists expect retailers to struggle in the new year as cash - strapped consumers rein in spending			1
bargain hunting : retailers slashed prices in the run - up to the festive season in a bit to lure cash - strapped customers the slight increase in sales was not sufficient , however , to save high street names like @entity34 and @entity35 , who have both fallen into administration recently despite posting positive @entity39 sales			1
the increase in sales volumes was driven by clothing chains and department stores and came as store - price inflation dropped to its lowest rate for 16 months , the @entity11 said			2
there was evidence that spending on big - ticket items was still being held back as sales at household goods stores fell by 2.4 % month - on - month , the biggest drop since april 2010			0
economists have warned the sector is set to struggle this year , despite the growth in sales last month , as shoppers continue to cut back on non-essential spending and the economy teeters on the edge of recession			1
a graph from the @entity11 shows that while the volume of sales has only increased slightly compared with last @entity39 , the value of sales has increased more due to the increased price of goods data from the @entity11 shows that non-food stores fared the best over december , while automative fuel sales and non-store retailing remained roughly the same ‘ the risk remains that pressurised and worried consumers will put away their purses and wallets , and hunker down for an extended period after a late flurry of spending in the run - up to @entity39 and then taking advantage of the best of the bargains in the clearance sales , ’ said @entity73 , chief @entity3 and @entity75 economist at @entity76			0
the @entity11 said consumers spent £ 42.1billion in the retail sector last month , compared to £ 29billion in november and £ 39billion in 2010			0
clothing and footwear stores posted a 1.8 per cent month - on - month volumes growth while department stores such as @entity95 recorded 1.2 per cent monthly growth			0
data shows the value ( in £ millions ) spent in different retail sectors over the past two years in @entity3 too little , too late : peacocks stores saw like - for - like sales go up 17 per cent over @entity39 but it was n't enough to save the chain looking for a buyer : @entity35 went into administration sales at household goods store dropped by 2.4 per cent month - on - month , while food store sales saw weaker growth , with volumes rising month on month by 0.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent year on year			1
profit margins across the entire retail industry have been hit by big discounts , putting further pressure on companies struggling to stay afloat			0
a host of household names have run into severe financial trouble recently , including fashion retailer @entity34 , lingerie firm @entity119 and outdoor specialist @entity120 .			1

seasonal increase did n't stop @entity120 , @entity34 , @entity124 and @entity35 from *nearing* *collapse*
economists warn economy will struggle again this year
