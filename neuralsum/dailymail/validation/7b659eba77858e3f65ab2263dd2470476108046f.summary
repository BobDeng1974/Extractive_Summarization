after a day spent meeting students at a @entity8 school , the @entity5 found himself meeting @entity10 on the red carpet at a film premiere			1
walking down the red carpet outside the @entity14 , @entity3 was accosted by the much - loved character and cheerfully posed for photos			1
one of those things is the @entity32 film industry and during the reception that followed the premiere , the @entity5 presented his hosts with some old footage of @entity8 recently restored by @entity39			2
@entity3 's visit to the museum came after a day spent meeting school children and enjoying a kickabout with locals			1
watched by the excited children , @entity3 teed up a penalty and , after taking it , beamed as an excited child rushed up to give him a high five			2

' he asked them if they knew who @entity81 was , and said that if they got involved in football then one day they might meet him			0
' the @entity5 was interested in how football helps build confidence , self esteem and promotes good health , and how the game is going to become a big focal point in schools here			0
' the kickabout came on the third day of @entity3 's state visit to @entity53 , the first time a senior royal has visited the country since the queen in 1986			1
all smiles : @entity3 was n't the only delighted one - the coaches also seemed to approve well done : the @entity5 looked just as pleased by his efforts as the little boy did nice work : @entity3 and the youngster share smiles as they high five on the pitch and while it has been almost 30 years since she stepped off the plane in @entity109 , the visit clearly has n't been forgotten as her grandson discovered during a tour of a @entity8 trade fair			1
there , @entity3 came face - to - face with a portrait of his grandmother , which was taken by photographer @entity118 to mark the @entity97 's 88th birthday last year			1

@entity3 laughed and said : ' that ’s incredible , it ’s brilliant			0
' speaking to @entity170 , creative director of the @entity154 ’s @entity171 , he said : ' what you produce really gives people a chance to see these animals			0
' later , the @entity66 was particularly moved by the @entity178 robot , made by @entity179 , which allows paraplegics to stand and even walk			0
