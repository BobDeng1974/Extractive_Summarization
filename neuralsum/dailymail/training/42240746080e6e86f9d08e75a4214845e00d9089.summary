by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 03:10 est , 24 september 2013 debilitating : it 's suggested that 20 % of children suffer from @entity4 symptoms the common cold regularly tops the list of reasons for school absence - no surprise there			1
but the second most cited cause is irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity4 )			1
one mother who knows only too well how debilitating the condition can be is @entity15			2
her son @entity16 first developed symptoms when he started full - time at school at the age of four			1
' he started getting bad tummy aches , ' recalls @entity15			2
' every night he would be clutching his tummy and crying in agony			0
i would try to cuddle him to sleep			0
' in the mornings @entity16 would spend ages in the loo , suffering frequent bouts of diarrhoea			1
it was awful watching him in pain and not being able to do anything			0
' he 'd be terrified he would n't be able to get to the loo in time at school or that his classmates would notice the smell			0
' @entity15 's gp ordered blood tests to rule out serious digestive disorders such as coeliac and crohn 's disease			0
@entity16 was then referred to a dietician , who suggested eliminating various foods to see if the problem was a food allergy or intolerance			0
again the results were negative			0
it was only after talking to a friend , a long - term sufferer of irritable bowel syndrome , that @entity15 put two and two together			0
' it was a lightbulb moment , ' says @entity15 , from @entity52 , @entity53			0
' @entity16 's symptoms matched my friend 's almost exactly			1
' the symptoms of @entity4 are triggered when muscles in the large intestine become sensitised and contract			1
the underlying cause is unknown , but stress can be a trigger			1
' i realised @entity16 's problems had coincided with him starting full - time at school , ' says @entity15			0
' he did n't get on with his new teacher and that 's when it began			0
' yet when we 'd gone to @entity72 in the school holidays , the symptoms disappeared			2
' it was a relief to realise that @entity16 did n't have some horrible illness , but a shock to find out there was no cure			0
' while as many as one adult in three will suffer from @entity4 at some point , many do n't realise children can also be affected			1
indeed , one study suggested that 20 per cent of children suffer from @entity4 symptoms			1
the peak ages are from four to 12			1
so how can parents tell if their child has a simple tummy ache or @entity4 ? surprising : the second most cited cause for school absence is @entity4 ' most children will have bowel upsets and tummy aches when they 're having a stressful time but it usually goes away , ' says professor @entity98 , a gastroenterologist and adviser to the @entity100			1
' to be diagnosed with @entity4 requires symptoms going on for a month or two			1
' children should first be screened for coeliac and @entity104 's			2
' once these have been ruled out , @entity4 is the usual diagnosis , ' he says			1
' children do n't suddenly get @entity4 at 15 ; they 've probably always had it but it was put down to “ toddler diarrhoea ” or tummy troubles			1
' the problem is that @entity4 is simply a name for a collection of symptoms that have no medical cause			1
' one theory is that because @entity4 tends to be more common in the @entity53 , our diets , high in refined carbohydrates such as white bread , cakes and pasta , may play a part			1
there are certain predisposing factors , adds dr @entity125 , a gastroenterologist at the @entity126			0
' gastrointestinal infections are one , dietary sensitivities another , but the key thing is stress			2
' although there is no cure , there is plenty you can do to help , says professor read			0
' the doctor must try to understand the child and find out the cause of the stress			2
this might mean working with the parents			0
' for adults , guidelines from the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) suggest hypnotherapy or counselling , and while they do n't specifically refer to children under 18 , ' there 's good evidence that these are helpful ' , he adds			1
' the key is getting teenagers to understand what 's happening in their lives to make the symptoms happen			2
' precautions : if you suspect your child might have @entity4 , have them screened first for coeliac and @entity104 's children with @entity4 often dread going to school and live in fear of their friends finding out , says @entity166 , a hypnotherapist with 25 years ' experience who specialises in @entity4 and works with children in the @entity53 via gp referral			1
' one main fear is that they wo n't be able to get to the loo in time , and that can make them fearful of leaving the house at all			0
' it 's usually safe to say that the symptoms are learned responses and perhaps began as a result of previous gastro - intestinal upset , but lingered on			2
' mr @entity166 adds : ' sometimes the symptoms could also be a subconscious way for the child to obtain focus on themselves			2
parents of younger children , especially , may actually contribute to symptoms continuing			1
' i try to teach children that every thought has a physical response , and that they can learn to get rid of negative thoughts to reduce anxiety and @entity4 symptoms			1
' children with @entity4 are often advised to change their diet as some foods can trigger an attack , perhaps because they are harder to digest			1
they should also avoid caffeine , found in some fizzy drinks , which elevates the stress hormone cortisol			2
dr @entity202 , a gastroenterologist at @entity203 's and @entity204 and the @entity205 , has had promising results with a diet devised in @entity208			0
the ' @entity210 ' diet restricts foods containing poorly absorbed sugars called @entity213			0
' it works on the principle that not all sugars can be absorbed within the small intestine , ' says dr @entity202			0
' as a result , they are rapidly fermented by bacteria in the bowel which draws in fluid and produces gas			0
' this can cause symptoms including bloating , abdominal pain and diarrhoea			2
' foods containing @entity230 include honey , apples , pears , stone fruit such as peaches , onions , garlic , cabbage , beans and sweeteners such as sorbitol			0
research at @entity243 found that 75 per cent of those on the diet saw their symptoms improve			2
@entity16 , now 12 , has learnt to manage his symptoms through trial and error			1
certain foods , such as apples , seem to make matters worse , so he avoids these			0
' he 's doing well , ' says @entity15			0

the underlying cause of @entity4 is unknown , but stress can be a trigger
one in three adults will suffer from it at some point *...*
and 20 % of children experience its symptoms ; peak ages are from 4 to 12
