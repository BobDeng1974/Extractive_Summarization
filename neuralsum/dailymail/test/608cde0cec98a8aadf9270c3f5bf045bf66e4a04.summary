you would be forgiven for thinking that the sun looked like a giant yolk after an amateur astronomer captured what looks like a chick sitting on its surface			0
the strange formation was photographed by amateur astronomer @entity9 , and is a sun spot			1
the phenomenon is fairly common and the number of spots on the solar surface reflects with how active the sun is			1
they occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce , making a specific section of the sun stand out from its surroundings			1
the sun 's having a yolk ! @entity26 spots range hugely in size , from just 10 miles ( 16km ) to 100,000 miles ( 160,000km ) wide - big enough to be seen from @entity28 without a telescope			0
each one can be more than ten times the size of our planet @entity9 captured the festive photograph using a telescope at the bottom of his garden			1
mr @entity9 , 57 , set up the observatory shed at the bottom of the garden in @entity39 , @entity40 , after he left his job five years ago			2
' i 've been interested in astronomy since i was a child			0
i remember i used to love borrowing books about space from the library and i had telescope when i was 10 , ' he said			0
' but it all took a backseat when i went to university to study chemistry though			0
' the photograph of the chick - like sun spot was taken on march 10 at midday			2
the large telescope focuses on a specific wavelength of light and allows him to see the details created on the sun 's surface as hydrogen gas surfaces and swirls			2

sunspots have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to @entity71 ( 4,890 to 7,590 ° f ) , compared to 5,500 ° @entity72 ) for the surrounding solar material , which is why they are so visible			1
sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun , namely solar flares no , the picture on the left is not a sun spot ... : the photograph of the chick - like sunspot was taken using @entity9 's telescope that focuses on a specific wavelength of light			1
this allows him to see the details created on the sun 's surface ( another example of his work pictured , right ) mr @entity9 , 57 , set up the observatory ( pictured ) shed at the bottom of the garden in @entity39 , @entity40 , after he left his job five years ago			1

the hot spots are also the source of eruptions on the sun , mainly solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( @entity115 ) , all of which are linked to magnetic fields			2
the sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle , which has an average duration of 11 years			0
this also affects the frequency of sunspots			0
sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes , regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface			0

strange formation is a sun spot and fairly @entity149 number on the surface *correlates* with how active the sun is
spots occur when magnetic fields causes surface temperature to reduce , making a section stand out
have temperature of up to @entity159 ( 7,590 ° f ) , compared to 5,500 ° @entity72 ) of the surrounding solar material
@entity9 captured the unique photograph using a large telescope at the bottom of his garden in @entity40
