wolves entered this match with an undefeated record in the league at @entity4 all calendar year and with top spot in the @entity7 in sight			1
by full - time they had neither , beaten by a team buoyed under the management of @entity13 and with @entity14 at his bristling best			2
@entity15 scored the goal of the night , a glistening strike from almost 30 yards that curled into the top corner to illustrate why he had been on @entity20 ’s books until this summer			1
@entity21 's @entity15 curls in a sublime third goal for his side against @entity0 @entity25 players celebrate as @entity0 fans are unmoved while watching their side go down @entity0 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 : @entity28 6 ; @entity29 6.5 , @entity30 5 , @entity31 4.5 , @entity32 5.5 ; @entity33 5.5 ( @entity34 ’ 5.5 ) , @entity35 6 ( @entity36 ’ 6 ) , @entity37 6.5 , @entity38 5.5 ; @entity39 6 ( @entity40 55 ’ 5.5 ) ; dicko 7 subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity46 - @entity45 booked : @entity31 manager : @entity48 6 @entity21 4 - 5 - 1 : @entity49 6.5 ; @entity50 6 , @entity51 6.5 , @entity52 6 , @entity53 6 ; @entity54 7 ( @entity55 90 ’ ) , @entity56 6.5 ( @entity57 90 ’ ) , @entity15 7 , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 7 ; @entity14 7.5 ( @entity60 79 ’ 5 ) subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 manager : @entity13 7 but the plaudits should go to @entity13 , whose treatment at @entity69 reflects in even poorer a light given his start at @entity21 , and @entity14 , who was a nuisance all night			1
@entity13 made a big call to replace @entity63 , who scored twice to beat @entity74 on saturday , with @entity14 , who arrived on loan from @entity76 last week			1
but having studied @entity0 ’ draw with @entity77 he believed the 33 - year - old ’s physical presence would do damage			2
@entity14 created the first goal in the 21st minute , simply proving too strong for @entity31 as the pair raced for a bouncing ball down the touchline			2
one shoulder barge sent the @entity0 defender to the floor and enabled @entity14 to fire a cross that was converted by @entity59			1
‘ he wo n’t be wearing the armband , but he ’s a leader , ’ said @entity13 of the player who was at @entity90 last season			2
‘ i ’m quite surprised but happy we were able to get him			0
he brings intelligence , link - up play , goals , and assists as he showed			0
’ @entity59 claims his opener after benefiting from the strong work of @entity14 the loan move runs out on november 8 but do n’t be surprised to see @entity13 extend it			1
the goal sent @entity21 on their way to a second win on the bounce to lift them clear of the relegation zone			1
not since @entity107 claimed all three points last december had @entity0 lost here in the league , having won all four championship home games this season			1
but despite shining brightly in periods , @entity48 can only accept the visitors deserved the win for sheer ruthlessness			0
it extends a hoodoo @entity21 seem to hold over @entity0 , this their seventh consecutive victory in fixtures between the sides			2
@entity39 ’s capture on loan until january should prove a shrewd piece of business by @entity48			0
this was his first game since signing from @entity128 and within 17 seconds he almost produced instant payback , but his shot flew wide			0
wolves went closer in the sixth minute , @entity29 cutting in from the right and smacking the post with a left - foot shot from 20 yards			0
@entity54 made it two for @entity21 with his finish taking a slight deflection off @entity30 but @entity59 opened the scoring and in the 39th minute hesitant @entity0 defending allowed @entity14 to poke a pass into the box that struck @entity31 ’s hand			1
referee @entity142 could have awarded a penalty but in an instant @entity54 ran onto the ball and hit a finish that took a deflection off @entity30 to beat @entity28 at his near post			2
after the interval @entity58 brought a fine save from @entity28 with an effort from distance and then @entity15 showed his class			0
@entity53 ’s cross was headed clear only as far as the 21 - year - old , who took one touch and bent a wonderful shot that left @entity28 no chance			0
@entity38 pulled one back , finishing between the legs of @entity49 from @entity161 ’s pass , but it was in vain			1
‘ i was disappointed with our response to those goals , ’ said @entity48			0
‘ we looked shell - shocked			0
it knocked us too much			0
i ’m looking for a better reaction			0
’ @entity21 is flying under new manager @entity13 ( right ) with two wins on the bounce @entity14 , who was immense for @entity21 , is treated on the pitch after going down with a leg injury			1
