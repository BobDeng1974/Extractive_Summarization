by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 17:37 est , 11 december 2013 @entity1 , the star of reality tv show @entity2 , has revealed that her cancer of the uterus was caused by a non-viable pregnancy - and now the aggressive disease has spread to her lungs			1
the @entity10 neonatologist broke the news about her diagnosis last week after she and husband @entity13 , who both have dwarfism caused by a genetic condition , brought their second adopted child home to @entity19			1
@entity20 , who now wears a wig , has now detailed the terrifying moment that she learned something was wrong - and how doctors have struggled to know what treatment is best due to her size			1
' there are moments i feel just terrible , ' she told @entity30			0
' i ca n't believe it is happening			0
other times , i feel like this is just a bump in the road			0
' the couple , both 39 , have one adopted son , @entity37 , from @entity38 and they were in @entity40 to bring home their new daughter @entity42 , 2 , in october when @entity20 began bleeding			1
desperate to stay with her daughter but feeling increasingly faint , @entity20 made the difficult decision to return home			2
once back in the @entity48 , she was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcincoma , a cancer sparked by a non-viable pregnancy she had suffered			1
her fertility issues have been well documented on the show , and she was shocked when she became pregnant in august - although she said she was not surprised that an ultrasound showed the baby had no heartbeat			1
the couple adopted him from @entity38 last year ' i had figured it was n't going to be viable , ' she told @entity30			2
the embryo was removed but cells were left behind and sparked the quick - growing cancer			1
she began intensive chemotherapy while her husband was still in @entity40			1
but the mass in her uterus failed to respond to the chemo and grew four times its size - and then three tumors appeared in her lungs			1
' sometimes i think , " seriously ? really ? how can this be happening ? " ' she told people			0
doctors were forced to give her a hysterectomy - which they saw as their last resort because of @entity20 's small ariway			1
' we wanted to avoid surgery in her case because of her shortened airway and the difficulties she has had in the past with surgeries , ' said dr. @entity94 from @entity95			0
struggles : in her efforts to start a family @entity1 went through multiple grueling rounds of @entity100 egg retrieval and tried surrogacy			1
the couple 's surrogate miscarried and they turned to adoption ' but we felt we had no choice			0
the disease was not responding to chemotherapy			0
we had to do this in order to save her life			0
' @entity113 is a fast - growing form of cancer in the uterus that develops in women who are pregnant			1
it can occur after a normal pregnancy and it is possible for a healthy baby to grow at the same time			0
the cancer is most often caused by a hydatidiform mole , which is a tumor resulting from over-production of the tissue that is supposed to develop into the placenta - the organ that grows during pregnancy to feed the fetus			1
even after the mass is removed from the uterus , the abnormal cells can continue to grow and turn into cancer - as it did in @entity20 's case			1
@entity113 is an uncommon , but very often curable			0
most women whose cancer has not spread can be cured and will still be able to have children			1
one symptom is vaginal bleeding in a woman who recently had a hydatidiform mole or pregnancy , and chemotherapy is the main type of treatment			2
a hysterectomy and radiation therapy are rarely needed			0
source doctors were also faced with the issue of her size because they were unaware of how much chemotherapy to give her			1
' i called oncologists in @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity10 , ' dr. @entity94 said , ' and no one had experience with treating this type of cancer in a person with skeletal dysplasia			2
it was a very rare cancer , rare that it was found in a little person â€¦ a very rare situation			2
' now doctors have upped her dosage and hope she will not suffer an infection that will set her back			0
if this is the case , doctor say her prognosis looks good			2
' the treatment is rough , ' @entity20 said			0
' but i have a chance of being cured			0
i just have to push through it			0
