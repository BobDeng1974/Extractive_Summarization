by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 19:14 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 02:20 est , 12 september 2012 a children 's fizzy drink sold by @entity4 has won the right to be labelled as one of the recommended five - a - day portions of fruit and vegetables , even though it contains around six teaspoons of sugar			1
the fast - food giant has been cleared by the @entity13 watchdog to put @entity14 in the same category as eating an apple or a serving of broccoli			1
the drink is a mixture of fruit juice concentrate – including grape , raspberry and lemon – with fizzy water , natural flavourings and the preservative potassium sorbate			0
health pop : @entity29 's has won the right to label its new @entity32 drink as one of the recommended five - a - day portions of fruit and vegetables a small 250ml serving , which costs 89p , has 100 calories and 25g of sugar , which equates to around six teaspoons			1
the high levels of sugar come from the fruit juice content			0
but the @entity13 said that the addition of natural flavourings and preservatives in the drink ‘ did not negate the five - a - day benefits of that 150ml of fruit juice , providing the entire 250ml serving was consumed ’			1
the @entity13 made its decision after an investigation , which was launched in response to complaints about a @entity29 ’s tv commercial and an advert on the @entity55 website			2
a voiceover on the tv advert said : ‘ grape , apple , and raspberry juice with refreshing sparkling water			0
' @entity32 is full of fruity bubbles with no added sugar , artificial colours or flavours			0
and it ’s one of your child ’s five a day			2
’ @entity68 , of the @entity69 , said the @entity13 ruling was evidence that the rules which define health claims around fruit and vegetables are not sufficiently strict			2
he added : ‘ @entity4 is only doing what other companies do : exploiting the laxness surrounding the five - a - day claims regime for commercial benefit			1
‘ we are concerned that increasingly the five - a - day message – originally designed to tackle cancer and heart disease – is being used to promote junk foods , sometimes with very low fruit or vegetable content			1
an investigation was launched in response to complaints about a @entity29 's tv commercial and an advert on the @entity55 website ‘ if the government actually values the five - a - day claim and wants it to be a meaningful label that consumers can have confidence in , they need to re-issue and reinforce robust guidance restricting the five - a - day message to genuinely healthy foods			1
’ dietitian @entity105 , of @entity107 ’s @entity106 , said : ‘ sugary drinks can encourage tooth decay and erosion and lead to weight gain			0
' water is a much better option and milk is great because it is full of calcium and other vitamins and minerals			0
’ a @entity29 ’s spokesman said : ‘ we welcome the ruling by the @entity13			2
@entity14 is a drink designed for the @entity124 menu , served in a 250ml measure as standard and it is not marketed in any larger sizes			0
‘ in the development of @entity32 we followed the five - a - day guidance provided by the @entity131			1
