elusive : a ' @entity2 yeti ( as imagined by an artist : it has remained abominably elusive			2
but the hunt for the yeti is about to take a big footstep forward			2
a major yeti expedition is being planned after genetic analysis of two @entity2 hair samples showed they come from no known living creature			1
instead , they were an exact match to an extinct species of polar bear			1
@entity18 researcher @entity17 , a respected human geneticist , says that a creature very similar to it is ‘ almost certainly ’ still roaming the @entity2 – and tv company @entity20 is so convinced that it is organising an expedition to go and find it			1
professor @entity17 said : ‘ there may well be a yeti			2
’ in the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 years , professor @entity17 used a technique used by the @entity27 to catch criminals to read the dna of 30 samples of hair			1
the hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis or their bigfoot cousins and were part of museum and private collections around the world			0
twenty eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to racoons , horses and cows			0
but two did n’t fit the mould			0
their dna matched that recovered from a 40,000 - year - old polar bear fossil , the journal @entity51 reports			1
one hair was reddish brown and found in a ‘ yeti nest ’ in a bamboo forest in @entity57 ten years ago			2
the second was golden brown and taken from a ‘ yeti ’ @entity60 on the @entity64 - @entity63 border 40 years ago			0
the hunter described the creature as very aggressive and noticeably different to the bears with which he was very familiar			2
professor @entity17 said : ‘ they are almost certainly still there and the next step is to find one			0
‘ they are either really a polar bear of a different sort to the usual polar bears or they are a hybrid with brown bears			1
’ he added that the polar bear is the only type of bear to deliberately hunt humans			1
if the yeti is a polar bear relative , this could explain why it has such a terrifying reputation			1
distant cousins ? : a genetic analysis of two @entity2 hair samples showed they come from no known living creature , but were an exact match to an extinct species of polar bear a tv company is now planning a yeti - hunting expedition to the @entity2			1
professor @entity17 said : ‘ if they find one , they need to get some tissue to do genetic analysis			2
they also need to watch how it behaves and that might help explain why people thought they were yetis			0
’ the biggest yeti hunt was sponsored by the @entity107 and took place 60 years ago in 1954			0
the 600 - strong expedition failed to snare the mythical beast but did find footprints and hairs			0
professor @entity17 said : ‘ all of that has been lost but no one had the methods then to show what they had , unlike now			0
’ professor @entity118 , a fossil expert and evolutionary biologist from the @entity121 , said the @entity48 technique used in the study could be used to verify other hair samples			1
he said : ‘ will this ultimately lead to the recognition of new large mammalian species in out - of - the - way corners of the world ? ‘ no one – certainly no scientist – can know for sure			0
‘ what we do know is that scientific discoveries just as strange and unexpected … have happened before			0
