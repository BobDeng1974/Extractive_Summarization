less than 12 hours after his boss captured the nation 's attention with an energetic @entity5 address , vice president @entity0 grabbed the spotlight wednesday morning to promote his chances to grab the top job in 2016			1
despite near - universal recognition that the @entity10 presidential nomination is @entity12 's to lose , @entity0 told @entity14 host @entity13 that the race is ' wide open			1
' and he might challenge her , he said on ' @entity18			0
' ' yes , ' the vice president chuckled , ' there 's a chance , but i have n't made my mind up about that			2
' @entity25 , rested and ready : @entity0 says he 's got as good a shot as anyone to be the next president really ? @entity13 quizzed the vp on wednesday and gave him an opening to stomp on president @entity32 's news cycle following the annual @entity5 address @entity34 ? @entity0 thinks the @entity10 presidential nomination race is ' wide open ' despite former secretary of state @entity12 's commanding lead in every poll ' we 've got a lot of work to do between now and then			1
there 's plenty of time			0
' ' look , ' he said , ' the person who is going to – and , and @entity12 is really competent , capable person , and a friend – the person who is going to be the next @entity50 is the one who 's going to be able to articulate the clearest vision to the @entity53 people of where they 're going to take the country			2
' ' i think this is wide open on both sides , ' he insisted			2
@entity0 ran for the presidency in 2008 , announcing his candidacy by this point in the cycle eight years ago			0
but this time around he said he 's in no hurry to declare			0
' i do n't think you have to make up your mind until the summer , ' @entity0 explained , before pivoting back to his main job – promoting @entity32 's economic agenda in the wake of the annual speech before a joint session of @entity72			1
' look , right now my focus is getting implemented what the president talked about last night – nail down this recovery , and get the middle class back in the game			0
' the vice president will resume his duties a @entity82 cheerleader - in - chief wednesday afternoon when he hosts a 5:00 p.m. conference call with supporters			1
the call , billed as an ' off the record ' discussion but likely to be a freewheeling altar call for @entity32 , is being promoted by @entity89 , the group that was called @entity90 until after the president 's re-election			1
@entity0 is ' going to discuss the plans president @entity32 laid out in the @entity5 last night , ' the group said in an email to its list of millions , ' and give his take on what we can all do to help make progress this year			2
' he wo n't likely discuss his own presidential ambitions , however			0
also on the back - bench : @entity104 sen. @entity103 , a populist ' liberal 's liberal ' who insists she wo n't run , polls higher than @entity0 in some surveys @entity0 is a bigger long - shot for the @entity10 ' nomination than most of the @entity109 field opposing them			1
in mid-december a @entity111 poll put his national support in a primary fight at just 2 per cent			0
he has n't polled higher than 14 per cent among @entity10 – that was in a single late - december @entity14 poll – and usually hovers in the high single - digits			1
the most recent major poll , from @entity118 and @entity119 , puts him at 8 per cent , a single percentage point behind @entity104 sen. @entity103			0
@entity12 , however , wipes the floor with both of them : she attracted the support of 66 per cent of demcorats in the poll .			0

@entity0 has n't polled higher than 14 per cent among @entity10 when they 're asked to pick a horse for 2016
but he says there 's ' a chance ' he *'ll* challenge @entity12 , the *overwhelming* favorite on @entity53 's *political* left
' this is wide open on both sides , ' he said in an @entity14 *interview* , *referring* to both the @entity10 and @entity109 nomination fights
one poll in december showed @entity0 drawing the backing of just 2 per cent of @entity10
he will host a conference call wednesday afternoon for @entity89 , the *successor* group to president @entity32 's campaign *organization*
