by @entity0 for more than half a century , the sprawling 400 - acre site on the outskirts of the @entity4 town of @entity5 was a world - renowned centre of medical discovery			1
there , housed within laboratories bursting with high - tech equipment , a 2,500 - strong team of scientists researched and developed drugs that would treat everything from tropical diseases to erectile dysfunction			1
today , three years after the @entity19 pharmaceutical giant @entity18 handed that army of brilliant minds their @entity22 , the site is now a business park where the breaking news is the imminent arrival of a @entity27 ’s supermarket			1
sandwich in @entity4 , where thousands of highly skilled people were hired to work in the town 's @entity18 pharmaceutical plant while the 200 jobs it will bring are not to be sniffed at , it goes without saying that they will not be of the same calibre — or pay - grade — as those that went before			1
and while the locals might find the out - of - town store convenient , that will not compensate for the economic impact the closure of the @entity18 plant has had on the economy of @entity5			1
across this historic town , everything from hotels to bookshops , from the summer festival to the @entity51 decorations , was hit by the @entity19 corporation ’s decision to slash its @entity56 operation to the bone in 2011			0
it is against this background that residents view @entity18 ’s latest assault on a @entity56 company — and needless to say , they view it with a healthy degree of scepticism			1
last week , the @entity19 company tabled a £ 63 billion bid for @entity67 , @entity56 ’s second - biggest pharmaceutical company			2
if it goes ahead , it would represent the biggest - ever foreign takeover of a @entity56 firm			2
but there are growing concerns over what the deal would mean for @entity56 workers , and for the crucial research and development work they carry out			2
the @entity19 drug company hit the headlines when it created its anti-impotence drug viagra in a bid to address these fears , @entity18 ’s chief executive @entity81 wrote to the @entity84 to guarantee jobs while pledging to complete a substantial research and development facility in @entity87			1
but while @entity89 welcomed the assurances as ‘ robust ’ , there is widespread concern that his position may be compromised by the fact that @entity18 ’s pr and lobbying campaign is being led by a firm chaired by a close friend			1
back in @entity5 , @entity98 , a town councillor and chair of the local @entity101 , says : ‘ when @entity18 left it was devastating for the town			1
now we are hearing rhetoric about them wanting to invest in @entity56 again			0
‘ but how can there be all this talk when they had a perfectly good bespoke site here which they suddenly decided to pull out of ? for a lot of people , it simply does n’t make sense			0
’ take a stroll through the winding streets of @entity5 and beside the tea - rooms and antique shops , and you ’ll find that the scars left by @entity18 are still raw			1
in @entity124 , a stunning @entity123 - listed shop stands empty but for some of the original @entity127 fixtures and fittings			0
until three years ago , it was home to a highly successful independent bookstore employing four people			0
but when @entity18 announced it was to slash its workforce , the store ran into difficulties almost overnight			1
‘ @entity18 employees accounted for 30 to 40 per cent of our sales and we saw a slump after they announced the closure , ’ said then - owner @entity136			1
‘ my friends from the company said they were sorry , but the situation was so uncertain they had stopped spending until they knew their fate			0
’ further evidence of what exactly their ‘ fate ’ would be can be seen at the site of the former @entity18 facility on the outskirts of @entity5			1
today it has been renamed @entity153 and relaunched as a ‘ global hub for science , technology , business and enterprise ’			0
the @entity19 pharmaceutical giant is trying to take over their @entity56 rival @entity67 leading to fears that even more highly - skilled @entity56 jobs could be lost but while it has had some success in attracting new companies into the area , the void left by @entity18 is plain for all to see			1
once , this was the largest pharmaceutical research centre outside the @entity19 , but today huge empty car parks bear testimony to what happened on february 1 , 2011			0
‘ on that day we had a town council meeting about the @entity174 coming to sandwich that year , ’ recalls mr @entity98			0
‘ but as soon as the news broke it spread around the town in an instant			0
so what should have been a meeting with a celebratory mood became like a morgue — the impact was immediate			0
’ @entity18 's former headquarter building in @entity5 , @entity4 , where @entity184 was discovered initially , it was believed @entity18 would shut down the facility completely			1
but while in the end some 650 staff were retained at @entity5 , it was n’t just the people that @entity18 employed directly whose livelihoods were threatened			1
mr @entity98 estimates that some 3,000 people indirectly depended on the company for the lions ’ share of their income — everyone from cleaning contractors to taxi firms			0
‘ i remember going out for a curry to celebrate my birthday about a week before @entity18 made the announcement , and the local @entity203 was packed with people from @entity18 , ’ says mr @entity98			1
‘ without their business , the pubs and restaurants , in particular , have seen a big dip in their takings			0
’ among those to have suffered is @entity211 , owner of the @entity213 restaurant , on the quay by the @entity215 , the closest restaurant to the @entity18 site			1
‘ it was all very sudden when they went , ’ he said			0
‘ there were no rumours or talk beforehand			0
so the town was taken aback by what happened			0
they were a wealthy company who were very generous and then suddenly it stopped			0
we got a lot of people in for lunch and dinner — particularly business lunches — so we felt the full draught of the exodus			0
‘ the main problem here is we have 28 pubs and restaurants all competing for a smaller cake , and for the first six months we very definitely felt the loss of trade ... our profits for december were down 25 per cent because @entity18 had around a dozen @entity51 parties here			2
’ @entity243 , landlady of the admiral @entity245 pub , also said business had suffered — and not just behind the bar			0
‘ the biggest effect has been on the buy - to - let housing market , ’ she said			0
‘ a lot of people bought houses and rented them out to @entity18 people			2
when @entity18 went , the rental incomes disappeared			2
’ the company is seeking approval to buy @entity67 like others in @entity5 , she has been following @entity18 ’s takeover bid with interest			1
and she is unconvinced by the promise to invest in a combined @entity18 - @entity262 research centre in @entity87			1
‘ why did they build a “ mini-city ” here and then just go ? ’ she asks			0
‘ i fear the same thing might happen in @entity87			0
’ financial analysts would answer her question by pointing out that @entity18 has not achieved global success without being ruthless			2
it is a point made by @entity271 , a one - time @entity18 scientist and former mayor of @entity5 , who is currently a town councillor			1
he helped set up @entity18 ’s first lab in 1955 and says the decision to shut sandwich reflects a no - nonsense approach to making money			1
‘ they had n’t had anything new out of @entity5 for ten years , and @entity18 are not a company to reinforce failure , ’ said mr @entity271			1
‘ you do n’t keep things going which are losing money for you , so what were they to do ? ‘ of course we made our representations to @entity18 at the time and they explained that it was part of a global policy , that they were reducing hugely the amount of money they were spending on research			1
they did n’t do that because there was successful research going on , it was because there was n’t			0
’ and what about @entity87 , might the same happen there ? mr @entity271 thinks it is ‘ improbable ’ that @entity18 would not carry through with the initial investment , but adds that if , in ten years , the facility was not delivering it would be ‘ a different story ’			2
and he , like his fellow residents , knows just how big an impact that can have on every aspect of a local community			0
‘ we were proud of the fact that the company had such a presence in @entity5 — they did have a profound effect on the whole of the area , ’ he says			2
‘ not only did they employ a lot of people , who had a lot of money to spend locally , but there was also a knock - on effect socially because these people were involved in all sorts of activities in the town			0
’ not only did @entity18 sponsor the @entity51 lights and the tourist information bureau , it gave financial support to the town ’s popular summer festival			2
when @entity18 left , those holes had to be filled			2
of course , the biggest hole was that which the departing staff left behind on the outskirts of @entity5 — their offices , laboratories and support facilities			2
while the remaining 650 @entity18 staff still occupy a corner of the site , the rest of the business park is far from full			2
with support from central government the plan is to create 3,000 jobs there by 2017			0
so far , it has achieved less than half that number , with a few more to come if the new @entity27 ’s is given the green light			0
‘ @entity27 will play a key role in regenerating the site and help achieve the vision for @entity153 to become a world - leading employment location and a pioneer of innovation , providing a range of great benefits to @entity5 , ’ said @entity153 managing director @entity357 , somewhat predictably			1
nice spin , but for the people of @entity5 it will take more than words to forget the day they discovered how big business really works : a lesson that should not be buried beneath @entity18 ’s billions , or its promises to @entity67 and the government as it tries to wrest control .			1

@entity18 employed 2,500 research scientists in their plant in @entity5 , @entity4
world - beating research was conducted in the south coast laboratory
scientists worked on cures for a range of tropical diseases to erectile dysfunction
