but as these pictures show , some businesses have remained immune to the whims of fashion , surviving - and prospering - in spite of the profusion of high - street stores and out - of - town shopping centres			1
from a cobbler to a pub , some have proved that by bucking the trends and remaining true to their roots , they have flourished in the cut - throat world of business			1

' we have a way of working which might be considered old fashioned , but it 's necessary to our work , ' said @entity64 , 44 , director and last - maker at @entity24			2

' i love being the landlady of a place with such a rich sense of heritage , people come in because it 's so ornate			0
there 's a sense of pride there , ' @entity127 said			0
the pub 's urinals , floor and wall tiles are all original , while the ' privacy booths ' - used to divide the classes and to keep women away - were restored in 2004			1
the princess louise pub , which opened in 1872 , on @entity108 in @entity26 , with landlady @entity127 keeping the traditional ale house open ' these days people battle to get in them , there was 25 people squashed into one booth over @entity159 , ' @entity127 added			1
