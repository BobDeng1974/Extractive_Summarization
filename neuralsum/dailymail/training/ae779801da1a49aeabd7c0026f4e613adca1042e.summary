a newborn baby boy was found dead on a moving conveyor belt at a waste recycling plant after he was thrown out with the rubbish , an inquest heard today			1
the body was discovered by a horrified worker operating a picking line at @entity8 in @entity9 , near @entity10 , @entity11			1
at the time , the worker was separating mixed household and business waste including glass and paper			1
the body was discovered by a horrified worker operating a picking line at @entity8 ( pictured ) , @entity9 , near @entity10 , @entity11			1
it is thought the baby was born four weeks premature and was alive when his mother gave birth - but he died shortly afterwards			1
doctors believe he had been dead for a few days before he was discovered			1
police who investigated the tragedy sent leaflets to more than 35,000 local households that had rubbish collected that day in a bid to trace the mother			1
they also liaised with hospitals and quizzed 15 women as potential suspects but all were found to have given birth to healthy babies or were never pregnant at all			2
inquiries revealed a second baby had been found at the same plant 18 months earlier			1
she was not identified and there was no dna profile to match her and the boy			2
today the hearing was told officers were unable to identify the boy			1
his cause of death is also unknown as his body had suffered numerous fractures before being found			1
the discovery was made at 10pm on september 18 last year as workers were dealing with collections from @entity56 , @entity57 and private refuse companies			2
@entity59 , a recycle plant worker described how he saw what he thought was a body			1
he told the @entity10 hearing : ' i took a second look and then saw what i thought was a head			2
i shouted to stop and a colleague pulled the cord to stop the conveyor belt			0
i said something like " it 's a baby			2
" i heard someone say " is it "			0
i then started to feel sick			0
' i went to sit on the stair well			0
i then saw the site managers			0
i said " are you sure ? " i said " yes			0
" i knew it was obviously human when i saw its head and eyes			0
' he added : ' that image will stay with me for a long time			0
' inquiries revealed a second baby had been found at the same plant , pictured , 18 months earlier @entity86 , the site manager , told the inquest : ' we accept waste from 8am to 4pm , monday to friday			1
the rest of the time is spent processing the waste			2
we have 300 tonnes delivered each day by 50 wagons			0
' mr @entity86 told the inquest that legally the site must process the waste within 24 hours of it being deposited by the wagons			1
the wagons deposit the waste at the site , at which point it is weighed and dropped in a processing area before going through numerous machines which siphon off larger objects			2
he said : ' it goes in a large magnetic machine that lefts metal items and separates them			0
it goes through a large washing machine			0
' the waste then passes through a machine called @entity112 which separates the materials by size so that the larger objects can be sorted by hand on a conveyor belt			0
this is the start of the recycle process			0
if it is not suitable for the conveyor it goes to land fill			0
' det supt @entity123 of @entity124 said officers made contact with the local health authorities in @entity11 which included @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity10 , @entity130 and @entity131			1
various people came forward saying they had seen pregnant women on their street who they had not seen in recent months			0
he added : ' as we suspected the child was prematurely born or close to full time , we deemed it was likely that we would potentially , from inquiries , be able to find females that the local authority had concern for or were in the midwifery department - females pregnant but disengaged or had given birth and had not further contact with			2
' ' once we had established where all the refuse was collected , from analysts we were able to establish every single property that had rubbish collected that day			0
' fifteen females come into the enquiry and we were able to eliminate every single one as having a non - pregnancy or having given birth to a healthy child			0
' @entity158 told the inquest that dna tests were carried out to find links to the baby 's parents - however only a partial profile was found			1
the @entity166 results were run through local @entity11 and @entity168 databases and the investigation will remain open in the hope that someone will come forward			1
coroner @entity172 recorded an open verdict saying : ' the basis of the evidence shows that the death appeared to have occurred at least a few days before the baby was found			1
where the baby died we do not know			0
one of the things i have to determine if i can is whether the baby was a still birth or live			0
' on the balance of probability it is my cautious view that it is slightly more likely that this baby was born alive than dead			1
' the cause of death remains undetermined because of the state the body was in when it was found			2
