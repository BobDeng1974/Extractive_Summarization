a mother who found eggs of the world deadliest spider in a bunch of @entity6 bananas had to incinerate her vacuum after using it to clean them up			1
@entity10 , 30 , was told by pest control experts that she would have to burn anything that had come into contact with the @entity15 wandering spider eggs , as the arachnids are highly venomous			1
she first thought the bananas had mould on them after noticing a white lump when they were delivered to her home from the store in @entity25 , @entity26			1
she immediately threw the fruit in the bin , but a few eggs dropped on her kitchen floor , which she vacuumed			0
' i could n't believe it when the little cocoon opened			0
i thought it was just some mould and i was trying to get it off so i could use the rest of the bunch , ' mrs @entity10 said			1
' even when i saw what was in it - it looked just like frog spawn - i still did n't think the worst			0
but then it dawned on me and i jumped and threw them in the bin			0
' she first thought the bananas had mould on them after noticing a white lump , but when she poked it with a toothpick , a cocoon opened one bite from an adult @entity15 wandering spider carries enough venom to kill 225 mice the mother - of - one called the @entity6 store , which had delivered the shopping to her home and she was told someone would collect them			1
but she then received a call to say pest control experts would be round instead			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' the pest controllers asked where the eggs were and i told them the bin and they said ' right , we 'll take that '			1
' then they asked had anything else come into contact with the eggs , and i told them about my vacuum cleaner , so they said ' we 'll have to take that too '			2
all they could tell me is they thought they were tropical spider eggs			1
' it is not yet known exactly where the eggs came from and what species of spider they belong to			2
the bananas were delivered from the @entity6 store in @entity25 , @entity26 , to her home spider experts have told her it was unlikely the tropical eggs would hatch because it was not warm enough in the @entity104 and there were no adult spiders with them			1
they also said it was not absolutely necessary to fumigate her home			0
mrs @entity10 said : ' that 's good news , but i 'm still on the lookout for anything about the place			2
if i see one , i 've been told it 's safe to squash it , as you might do other spiders			2

' @entity6 has offered to replace her bin and the cleaner			2
a spokesman said : ' we set ourselves high standards for the food we sell and were concerned to hear of this incident			0

their @entity151 name @entity153 actually means ' murderess ' - an indication of their deadly bite			2
they are known as the wandering spider because they do not build webs , but instead walk the jungle floor at night looking for prey			0
@entity15 wandering spiders are nocturnal , and so find places to hide during the day			1
this is why they are so dangerous , because they hide in houses and cars , where they are easily disturbed by humans			0
they may be considered the most toxic spider , but they are not the biggest			0
their leg - span reaches up to five inches			0
when the spiders are defending themselves , they lift their body up on their hind legs in a defensive display			0
