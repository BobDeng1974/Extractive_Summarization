a dream 50th birthday trip to @entity2 for 15 life - long school friends into a nightmare after they lost £ 11,000 when her travel agent went bust			1
organiser @entity8 , 50 , saved for three years to go to @entity2 with her friends to have a joint birthday celebration			1

the group from @entity44 , @entity45 , had paid their deposit on protected @entity48 cards			2
but the majority of the holiday was paid by bank transfer after the company claimed that if they paid quickly , they would receive £ 70 worth of vouchers to use on the trip			1
it looked doomed - until a friend loaned them the cash to rebook the holiday despite it costing double the original cost			1

i ca n't believe that suspicion was n't raised			2
