by @entity0 a five - day trip with six mates to @entity3 , followed by a night out with a glamorous model in @entity5			1
is @entity6 turning into one of those 24 - hour party people ? such is the uncommon fascination with the @entity11 ’s social life , perhaps we better start by dealing with what he ’s been up to since he played in the @entity15 two weeks ago			1
‘ we had a nice boat and we stayed on that and went out to sea every day , so it was n’t your typical lads trip			0
’ and the night out in the fair city when he got home , sparking the usual frenzy in the gossip columns and beyond ? ‘ i ’m clearly not playing well enough if people do n’t want to talk about my golf , ’ he said , without a trace of rancour			1
‘ let ’s just say i ’m very single and very happy at the minute			0
’ speaking freely : @entity6 was open during a press conference ahead of the @entity54 signing autographs : @entity6 in action during the @entity57 prior to the start of the @entity54 @entity59 to learn new course - @entity6 there ’s more than one way to experience ecstasy , of course , and @entity6 is hoping to follow in @entity65 ’s footsteps and find it after leaving @entity3			1
‘ i know @entity65 spent some time there after the @entity68 , so let ’s see if i can follow his example at @entity71 and win @entity72 , ’ he said			1
before all that , there is @entity6 ’s decision to follow @entity77 ’s example and end his five - year exile from the @entity79 at @entity80 today			1
‘ i played with @entity77 for the first two rounds at the @entity15 at @entity86 last year and you could see he was ready to play , that his game was really sharp , ’ said the 25 - year - old , about the @entity82 who opened so many eyes with his @entity54 and @entity15 double last year			1
' you could tell he had played competitive golf the week before and even then i was thinking i might play the @entity91 next year			1
there ’s a few of us that @entity77 really influenced in that regard			0
’ green fingers : @entity6 takes a putt during the pro-am in @entity80 on wednesday there might be a few who will wish they had n’t been swayed come sunday , for this glorious links is far removed from the rather benign test presented by @entity104 last year			1
in 1996 the @entity54 was staged at a similar beast in @entity106 and @entity107 was among those who raged as he walked off the 72nd green , claiming his swing had been ‘ destroyed ’ and his chances at the @entity15 in tatters			2
‘ there ’s certainly a case for saying this will be a harder test than next week ’s , ’ said @entity6 , who played at @entity117 at the weekend			1
‘ i think we all know this is going to be quite a challenge , and particularly with the weather forecast of wind and rain for a couple of days			2
' but i am trying to adopt the mindset of relishing that challenge			0
if the conditions get really bad then yes , it is going to be a tough week and a long slog			0
' but i do n’t see how it should affect anyone ’s chances next week			0
you can take monday off and then get back at it , so i do n’t have any concerns on that front			0
’ in the spotlight : @entity6 has been in the tabloids for his trip to @entity3 and night out with an @entity142 model high - profile split : the former world @entity145 ended his relationship with @entity147 earlier this year three years ago , @entity6 had so many concerns about links golf he had a little moan after playing in the wind at @entity152 ’s			1
a top ten finish in the @entity15 in frightful conditions at @entity155 the following year was the start of a change of heart			2
‘ i played pretty well but what was more pleasing was the fact i was playing the shots that you need to play on a links , which was more important than my scores , ’ he said			2
@entity6 was asked the inevitable question about @entity166 ’s return next week and admitted his surprise he was playing in the @entity15 so soon after his return from back surgery			1
glory days : @entity166 won @entity72 the last time it was held at @entity117 in 2006 ‘ i do n’t think i would want to start back at a major under that amount of pressure but he ’s done it for so many years and knows how to deal with it well , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ he ’s missed a chunk of the season and i am sure he wants to get into the @entity180 play - off events in august at least and maybe push for a @entity182 place			0
' so i would n’t write him off completely next week			0
i still think he can do things that we do n’t see from any other golfer , so we will see what happens			0
’ must do better : @entity6 , pictured at @entity187 , is hoping to find his form at the @entity54 as he walked off the 18th green following his pro-am round yesterday , @entity6 went straight to a television interview			1
‘ it ’s behind you ! ’ said @entity192			0
when @entity6 duly turned round , he saw the sparkling @entity195			2
@entity6 ’s answer , however , would surely gladden the heart of the sponsors			2
‘ i said to him : “ i will focus on that next week , ” ’ said @entity6			2
‘ you know , we should n’t forget this is one of the big titles in @entity204			0
' believe me , if i ’m in contention come sunday afternoon , i wo n’t be thinking about anything else but trying to win the @entity54			2
' when i won the @entity209 at @entity210 in may it might not have been quite in front of a home crowd but it was in front of fans who were really supportive			0
and i think it would be the same here			0
’ @entity217 prepare for @entity15 challenge			0

@entity6 has been in the public eye in recent days after *spending* time in @entity3 with pals
he was also spotted on a night out with a glamorous model @entity22 in @entity5
ahead of the @entity54 he joked : ' i *'m* clearly not playing well enough if people do *n't* want to talk about my golf '
the 25 - year - old is hoping to hit form ahead of @entity72 at @entity117
