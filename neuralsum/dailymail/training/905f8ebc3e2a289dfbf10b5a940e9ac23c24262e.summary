this week the 2014 @entity0 honoured the brightest stars in the women 's underwear market at a star - studded ceremony			1
a glance at the winners ( scroll down for a full list ) may give @entity9 men help on where they should head to buy @entity12 lingerie presents - but how do they decide on specifics ? it 's a staple gift but many men are clueless when it comes to buying underwear for their other halves , opting for unsuitable bras , knickers , basques and suspender belts			1
and most women say it 's because it was the wrong size , uncomfortable or too skimpy			1
one in five wear the gift just once before hiding it away			0
sex appeal : @entity42 were named ' @entity44 ' thanks to designs like this palazzo push - up bra , £ 68 , @entity47 , £ 65 , @entity49 briefs - £ 36 comfort and style : opera half cup bra £ 60 , and shorty briefs £ 36 ( l ) and @entity56 t - shirt bra , £ 66 , and shorty briefs £ 38 ( r ) by @entity42 however well over a third ( 39 per cent ) of recipients of undesirable undergarments admitted they had not told the men in their lives their true feelings about the gift for fear of ' hurting their feelings '			2
four out of ten of men questioned said they were embarrassed to enter lingerie departments and just over a third ( 35 per cent ) wrongly quoted their partners size when asked			2
the poll of @entity74 customers also found that while two thirds of women had been given lingerie at some time as a present , only 26 per cent said their partners had bought something they really liked			1
women also expressed concern that risqué underwear would be a more popular gift this year because of the publicity surrounding the much awaited film adaptation of @entity87 due to hit the cinema on @entity89 next year			2
the two sexes have very differing tastes			0
bright red was a turn off for more than two out of three women but this subtler version of the shade ca n't fail to impress : @entity97 , bra , 28 , knickers , £ 14 ( l ) and @entity100 - £ 32 , @entity101 - £ 14 , @entity102 - £ 20 ( r ) be daring : @entity103 , £ 39 , @entity102 , @entity101 - £ 24 @entity104 £ 15 and @entity105 £ 10 ( l ) and @entity106 £ 12 and @entity107 £ 5 find underwear to compliment her figure : pictured on the model is @entity113 , @entity114 at @entity74 , bra £ 28 , knickers £ 12.50 , and suspender belt £ 20 @entity117 , head of lingerie buying and design at @entity74 , says : @entity121 style lingerie , thongs or cut - out knickers were disliked by 75 per cent of women , although 54 per cent of men think a thong is sexy			1
among men under 35 years old , this figure rose to 78 per cent			0
bright red was a turn off for more than two out of three women ( 68 per cent ) while six out of ten men ( 61 per cent ) said it was their favourite underwear colour , followed by black ( 32 per cent )			2
men also liked the classic boudoir image of matching lace , suspenders , sequins , bodices and stocking all in the brightest colours			0
however , women said they do like to wear sensual underwear saying it made them feel more desirable and confident , with eight out of 10 saying that they owned romantic sets they brought out for special occasions			0
but they added they liked underwear to be practical and able to be worn in everyday life , not just the bedroom			0
women also like softer fabrics in more understated tones and lingerie which was flattering , but also comfortable			0
uplifting : @entity155 won the marketing campiagn of the year , pictured is their @entity158 bra £ 28 , and knickers £ 14.50 flaunt your curves : @entity163 bra , £ 30 and thong £ 14 ( l ) and @entity165 ( r ) the b.flirtatious contour bra with all over floral mesh with bikini briefs from @entity169 @entity170 , £ 43 , and @entity171 £ 38 , @entity101 , £ 13 @entity172 , £ 35 , @entity101 £ 16 in an attempt to prevent men making disastrous choices this @entity12 , @entity74 , who were crowned the @entity9 's @entity174 at the @entity0 , are trialling its first @entity178 at its flagship @entity179			1
the project aims to help men find the perfect lingerie present by familiarising them with desirable choices that also help make their partner feel confident , comfortable and positive			0
the first ever clinic took place last night , december 4 , where experts were on hand to advise on fit and style plus matched up what one partner likes to look at with what the other might enjoy wearing			0
men can attend the @entity178 without their partners for one - to - one expert advice on picking the perfect underwear gift to surprise the woman in their life			1
@entity204 - £ 48 , and the @entity205 - £ 29 with matching suspender belt and knickers @entity117 , head of @entity74 lingerie says : ' there are many tips that we can pass on to men to help ensure any lingerie they buy pleases the women in their lives as well as themselves , but it is important that they get the basics right such as buying the right size			1
' this is where the @entity178 will really help in identifying the different brands that will fit a particular female body shape and in a style and colour that makes the wearer feel both comfortable and confident			0
' we know that many men do n't feel at ease in lingerie departments so our first ' clinic ' will be in a relaxed environment where people can get one to one attention and hopefully leave with a gift they know will be well - received			2
