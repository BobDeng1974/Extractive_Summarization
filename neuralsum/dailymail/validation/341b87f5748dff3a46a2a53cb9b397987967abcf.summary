the @entity1 mayor said it would be ' fatal ' for the @entity3 to give any suggestion of a fresh power - sharing deal @entity6 should rule out coalition with any other party after the general election , according to @entity10			1
the @entity1 mayor suggests it would be ' fatal ' for the @entity12 to give any suggestion that it is in the market for a fresh power - sharing deal with the @entity16 or another smaller party			1
' we should say " stuff coalition with anyone " , ' mr @entity10 told the @entity19			1
' we are there to win , we are there to offer leadership , we are there to be a @entity12 government			1
' if we go into this thing issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party , it would be absolutely fatal			1
' asked whether the prime minister should rule out a second coalition altogether , mr @entity10 replied : ' yes			1
otherwise people do n't know what they are voting for			0
' @entity37 says there is no appetite among @entity16 for another coalition – or among the two big parties			1
' a lot of @entity6 's @entity3 want a @entity12 - only government , even if it 's a minority one , and similarly on the @entity46 side , ' the former @entity16 leader told the @entity47			1
' i suspect – if you have to look into the crystal ball – that we 're going to get a minority government which will have a multitude of minorities in the parliament , which is something new , and they 'll be able to play one off against the other			0
' he said the most that @entity16 would countenance in another hung parliament would be a ' confidence and supply deal ' , where they agreed to support a larger party in key votes but did not enter a formal coalition or take ministerial jobs			2
he also said that his party needed to ' recharge its values '			0
mr @entity10 , who is mr @entity6 's chief leadership rival , criticised the fixed - term parliaments legislation introduced by the coalition – suggesting it should be repealed			1
' the sooner it expires , the better			0
i always thought it was some bit of @entity16 nonsense , ' he said			0
' constitutionally the thing we need to address is the rank injustice that it takes so many thousands more votes to elect a @entity12 rather than @entity46 mp			0
it 's an absolute scandal			2
' former conservative minister sir @entity81 has led the calls for a cross-party deal to repeal fixed - term legislation , branding it a ' recipe for political horse - trading and coalition manoeuvrings '			1
@entity46 's @entity90 and @entity12 @entity91 support the move			2
critics say five years is too long , risking a ' zombie parliament ' in the final year			0
few appreciated the long - term impact of the constitutional change , which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election			2
@entity10 - considered mr @entity6 's main rival for the @entity12 leadership - said he should rule out any coalition deal after the election it means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the @entity107 to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable			1
instead , they need to win the support of a ' supermajority ' of two thirds of mps for an election to be held at any time outside of a five - year fixed period			0
this means the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents			0
the only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no - confidence			0
but other parties then have a two - week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held			2
a new coalition could therefore take power without an election			0
critics say the legislation is a recipe for never - ending power - sharing .			0

@entity6 should rule out a coalition and govern alone , @entity10 says
the @entity1 mayor said it would be ' fatal ' to suggest it wanted a coalition
mr @entity10 is considered @entity6 's chief conservative leadership rival
