by @entity0 published : 04:22 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 07:09 est , 18 july 2013 the world 's most famous paintings have been recreated using just a torch			0
light artist @entity4 completed his collection of copies of masterpieces last week , with his take on @entity10 's ' @entity9 '			1
@entity4 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , painstakingly drew every brush stoke with a torch , using long exposure to photograph his creations			1
' interpreting famous pieces of art from entirely different artists was about as challenging as things could get			2
i just had to give it a shot			0
' i light paint by using a long exposure , and have no visual trace to reference from as i 'm ' painting ' in the dark in a three dimensional space			2
' the series was shot entirely in the @entity35 and includes @entity34 's @entity32 , @entity60 's @entity59 , @entity19 's @entity61 , @entity63 's @entity62 , @entity65 's @entity64 and @entity10 's @entity9			1
the copy of @entity63 's 1889 oil painting was created using the longest exposure , with @entity4 leaving the shutter open for more than 20 minutes			1
making waves : the @entity72 artist has copied @entity73 's @entity64 off @entity74 using strokes of blue and white light masterpiece : the @entity80 artist 's original image , which is also known simply as @entity64 , was a woodblock print created in the 1830s tribute : @entity4 used a deserted bridge in the @entity72 hills as the setting for his version of @entity60 's 2003 graffitti work the @entity59 he added : ' it 's difficult to pick a favourite because i love them all for different reasons			1
i think the @entity63 interpretation has the slight edge			1
i love the original , and is was a difficult image to complete			0
' the overall reaction has been surprisingly phenomenal ; quite humbling , actually			0
' in the past nine years , @entity4 has exhibited and created light art around the world and has been commissioned to make pieces for companies like @entity101 and @entity102			1
incredibly mr @entity4 has to visualise the image he wants to create after observing the setting and then rely on memory to light - paint			1
speaking earlier this year he explained the process			0
' in real time , i leave the camera 's exposure open , ' he said			0
' while the camera is exposing for up an hour , i step into the scene and move light sources in a way that is captured on the camera 's sensor			2
' in real time , the casual viewer will only see me moving lights about in what seems a random fashion			0
all the while the camera 's sensor is picking up the trails of light , and recording real time in one still image			2
night sky : this recreation of @entity63 's @entity62 was the most complex of the set of images the @entity72 artist created and needed the longest exposure , with the camera shutter open for more than 20 minutes the @entity62 : @entity63 's painting shows the night - time view from the window of the sanitorium in @entity139 where he was living in 1889 @entity141 of his eye : @entity4 's version of @entity10 's @entity9 focuses on the apple at the centre of the painting and the stormy clouds above ' i need to rely on memory and spatial awareness to create the images because while i am in motion			1
i can not see how the image is going to be until the absolute end			0
' ' some people have asked if i have ever used photo - shop on my work and i have to tell them that it is simply created with a torch , a camera and the canvas of the night			0
' the 43 - year - old first discovered his passion for light art after he accidentally knocked over a tripod while taking a photo on a holiday in @entity168 and noticed how the moon had made a streak through the image			2
ever since , he has been obsessed with using light to paint and uses empty urban and rural locations at night as the setting for his works			0
speaking about his latest project , @entity4 said : ' this has been a shift from my usual style , so i did n't know what to expect			2
i 'm happy with what i achieved , and am pleased other people are on board with that			0
' find out more on @entity4 's website the artist : @entity4 was inspired to create lightworks after accidentally knocking over a tripod and seeing it had caused the moon he was photographing to streak through the image			1
