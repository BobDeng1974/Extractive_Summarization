by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 06:21 est , 26 december 2013 @entity3 : 22:07 est , 26 december 2013 with his studs up , prince @entity4 does a good impression of @entity8 legend @entity7 with this ugly tackle			1
the challenge could have earned a red card if his boots had made contact with his opponent in a competitive game			0
but that did n’t stop him making other heavy - handed attempts to win the ball in a festive friendly – even if his brother @entity20 was on the receiving end			2
the two princes were playing on opposite sides in the now - traditional @entity25 fixture involving estate workers near the @entity28 ’s @entity27 in @entity29			2
studs up : prince @entity4 lunges aggressively into a tackle during the charity @entity32 football match steady on : prince @entity4 slides in for a tackle on his brother @entity20 during the match at @entity27 estate tired : the 29 - year - old who , was playing on the opposing side to his brother @entity20 , looked worn out after recently returning from his 200 - mile trek to the @entity39 while the banter was relatively friendly , it was clear that the brothers were playing to win as they clattered into each other on the rain - sodden pitch at @entity45			1
at one stage , @entity4 , 29 – still bearded from his @entity48 charity trek – made fun of an opponent ’s corner kick			1
@entity20 , 31 , jokingly pleaded with the referee to issue a card , saying : ‘ give him yellow , give him yellow – backchat			0
’ the @entity57 , who was wearing a red and white striped shirt and light blue @entity61 socks in honour of his favourite team , was also seen throwing himself into the game			2
rugged : the prince was still sporting the beard he grew during his recent expedition to the @entity39 as he joined villagers and estate workers for the match embrace : the two brothers hugged at the end of the game , which ended in a 2 - 2 draw post-match : the two princes congratulated teammates and opposition after the game eye on the ball : prince @entity20 also got stuck into the annual fixture , and wore the socks from his beloved @entity61 with his thinning hair , onlookers said the 31 - year - old looked like former @entity90 footballer @entity89			1
@entity92 pilot @entity4 ’s competitive streak saw him battle hard to win the match for his team – with a tackling style reminiscent of @entity7 , renowned as one of the toughest defenders of the 1960s and 1970s			2
when they went a goal down to @entity20 ’s side after ten minutes , the younger prince soon scored to put them level			0
covered in mud , @entity4 ’s team , in white tops , came from behind again in the second half and the game eventually finished at 2 - 2			1
the princes then proved they were still the best of friends by hugging after the final whistle in the match between @entity27 estate workers and villagers from @entity45 blew			0
one of the players was injured during the match and was taken to hospital , but the game continued and the teams shook hands at the end			0
around 100 locals turned out to watch the match and prince @entity20 was seen mingling with spectators at half time			0
mind my head ! the @entity57 winces as he shields himself from a stray shot speed and skill : the brothers showed off their footballing prowess with @entity20 ( left ) teeing up a volley and @entity4 looking to out run a defender as he latches onto a pass an onlooker said : ‘ @entity20 and @entity4 are both fairly reasonable players – but it seemed that @entity4 had the edge when it came to fitness			1
it is probably not surprising because @entity4 is a serving soldier and has just come back from a 200 mile trek to the @entity39			1
‘ @entity4 was getting around all over the pitch and was beating his brother in most challenges , but @entity20 won his fair share of balls			0
‘ it was a very good - natured game with no serious fouls or injuries , but they were not shy about steaming into each other			0
’ @entity155 of @entity57 stayed at @entity27 with @entity156			1
but princess @entity158 ’s son @entity157 watched from the touchline with his wife and two @entity161 had gathered at @entity27 to celebrate @entity32 , surrounded by 30 members of the @entity163			2
the referee 's verdict : @entity166 said @entity4 was ' a little over exuberant '			0

@entity168 went head - to - head during the annual charity @entity32 match at @entity27 , which ended in a 2 - 2 draw
