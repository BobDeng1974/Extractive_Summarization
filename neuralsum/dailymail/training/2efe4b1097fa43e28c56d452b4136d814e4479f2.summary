by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 10:55 est , 30 august 2013 a set of six - week - old twins who were born joined at the abdomen have been successfully separated in a nine - hour operation involving 40 medical staff			1
@entity6 and @entity7 are now recovering in their own beds in intensive care at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 - to the overwhelming relief of their parents , @entity17 and @entity18			1
when the babies were born in @entity21 , @entity22 on july 17 , they shared a liver and intestines			1
their parents , who have two other sons , moved to @entity12 for the boys ' medical care			2
on saturday , they were prepared for surgery and a team of doctors , surgeons and nurses worked to separate the boys , either of whom could have been lost in the operation , @entity29 reported			1
' as a mother , i hope i never have to experience a moment like that again , ' @entity53 wrote in her ' @entity59 ' blog on tuesday			0
' i did n't know what was going to happen			0
i did n't know if i would see my babies alive again , if i would see only one , or if i would see them after they had gone to be with their creator			0
' but doctors successfully separated the boys ' shared liver and other parts of their digestive system			1
loved : @entity17 and @entity53 say goodbye to their sons before they head to the nine - hour surgery concerns : @entity17 and @entity18 become emotional as the boys are taken to surgery on saturday brotherly love : @entity18 watches as her eldest son @entity76 comforts his little brothers @entity6 and @entity7 , who shared a liver and some of their digestive system when they were born last month they will need further surgeries in the future ; after they are two - years - old , they will require ' skin expanders ' for their wounds , their mother explained			1
another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place , which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar after this , if the parents wish , they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them			1
but for now , the family is just taking it one day at a time			2
' they 're starting to open their little eyes , and they 're starting to wiggle their little fingers , ' their father , @entity102 , told @entity109 - @entity108			2
' you can see that recognition in their face			0
' the family now hopes that the twins will be able to return home in time for @entity118			1
@entity119 : an ultrasound shows the boys attached at the abdomen while in @entity124 's womb early days : another image shows the babies after their birth			2
the family hopes they will be home by @entity118 ' it 's wonderful for us to be able to sit here and think about , " how are we going to bring these two boys home ? what are they going to be like ? " ' mr @entity7 said			1
the couple has kept family , friends and strangers up to date on the pregnancy , birth and surgery through their blog and on @entity147			2
' as far as the rest of the future steps , i know healing , breathing independently of machines , and feeding are on the horizon , but i 'm not sure how long it will take , ' @entity18 wrote on the blog			0
' i 'm hoping we will get to take them home by @entity118 , but that might be wishful thinking			1

around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn , and about 35 per cent survive only one day			0
the survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent , the @entity191 reported			0
the condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest , sharing organs			0
chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs , experts say			1
although success rates have improved over the years , surgical separation is still rare			0
since 1950 , at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time			2
after separation , most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines			0
although risky , there are many stories of successful separations			0
most recently , @entity222 twins @entity221 , who were born sharing an abdomen , pelvis , liver , kidney , large intestine and two legs , just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four			1
their family said the girls , who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics , are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been .			0
