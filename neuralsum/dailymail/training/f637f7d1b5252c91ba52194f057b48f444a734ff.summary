at dawn @entity1 civil servants @entity2 and @entity3 each begin their commutes across the war - torn city of @entity8 , a once - short journey that now takes 10 hours			1
a frontline slices through the former economic hub from north to south , with rebels in control of more than half of the devastated city			0
people like 45 - year - old @entity2 , who works as a driver for the state , must travel for more than 400 kilometres ( 250 miles ) by bus just to get from one side to the other			1
a damaged sign in the industrial area of @entity8 , pictured on november 18 , which has been devastated by the @entity1 civil war commuters in @entity8 taking the bus must now pass through checkpoints run by murderous @entity30 militants they face grave danger as they detour through an area under the control of the @entity34 ( is ) jihadist group , which has seized large areas in @entity1 and neighbouring @entity37			1
until a year ago , residents could cross from one side of @entity8 to the other through a checkpoint at @entity42			1
but because of snipers , it was closed			2
after working for 10 days straight in a regime - held neighbourhood , @entity2 waits for the bus at a station in the @entity8 district to go home to @entity51 , a rebel area just five kilometres ( three miles ) away			1
to get there the bus must first cross an area that is under army control , before reaching a desert zone that has become a no - man 's land over the course of the more than three - year - old war			1
he and other passengers then risk their lives as their bus drives through @entity64 , an area of @entity8 province that is controlled by @entity66			1
from there , the bus travels back into @entity8 city			1
' before we reach the @entity66 checkpoint , women climb into the back of the bus and veil their faces completely , ' said bus driver @entity77 , who makes the risky journey three times a month			2
' they are not allowed to travel alone , according to the laws imposed by the jihadists			2
so we must make sure they are accompanied by their husband or brother			0
i check carefully , because i will pay the price if anything goes wrong , ' he told @entity90			0
for @entity2 , each journey is now a dive into the unknown			2
until a year ago , residents could cross from one side of @entity8 to the other through a checkpoint at @entity42			1
but because of snipers , it was closed the ruins of a company head office in the @entity1 city of @entity8 some commuters are risking their lives on the bus journey around @entity8 ( pictured ) two or three times a week @entity1 rebels and bystanders watch bulldozers clean the debris outside @entity111 in @entity8 , a city that now has a frontline running through it from north to south ' a jihadist from @entity115 gets on the bus , armed with a sword rather than a @entity118 , ' he said , using an @entity120 acronym for @entity66			1
' he checks everyone 's documents , and forces suspects to get off the bus , threatening them with his weapon			0
i always say i am a tailor , because if i admit i am a civil servant , they will throw me in jail , ' @entity2 said			0
but all of the forces on the ground - loyalists , the is and the rebels - have their databases			2
' one mistake , and you disappear , ' he said			0
@entity3 lives in the rebel district of @entity137			2
he too crosses the frontline to get to the ministry where he works			0
' our journey from one side of @entity8 to the other is filled with danger			1
it used to take 10 minutes , but now it takes 10 hours because of a big detour , ' he told @entity90			1
' there are many checkpoints and dangers along the way , but i must make the journey because i am a civil servant and i have no other source of income			1
sometimes , i make the journey twice or three times a week			0
@entity159 have mercy on us , ' he said			0
the bus ticket price has shot up because of the war			0
the bus journey for some workers across @entity8 now involves travelling across no - man 's land , as well as through government - controlled areas and militant check - points war - torn : a ruined mosque in @entity8 it used to cost just 20 @entity1 pounds to get from one neighbourhood to the other			1
now it costs 2,500 pounds ( $ 12.5 ) from the government to the rebel sides			0
about 800 people make the journey each day from the regime side , while roughly the same number leave from the rebel area , said @entity180 , who runs the bus station			2
people living on both sides say loyalists and rebels demand bribes to let them through their checkpoints , but is poses the biggest danger for drivers			0
one told @entity90 he received 30 lashes because the jihadists thought his beard was too short			0
another said he was lashed because he forgot to switch off the radio before he reached the @entity66 checkpoint			0
a third driver said he spent 48 hours in an @entity66 jail , and that he was only set free when he could recite a prayer correctly			0
many passengers make sure to have one last cigarette before climbing on board , because @entity66 forbids smoking			0
' this is the road of fear			0
it is absurd to have to drive for hours through the desert to get from one side of the city to the other , ' said @entity211 , who travelled to the regime - held side of @entity8 to see his doctor			1
' this division of @entity8 is absurd			2
' one commuter described the division of @entity8 as ' absurd ' @entity1 men sit next to a wrecked factory in @entity8 's industrial area , a potent symbol of an economy lying in ruins			1

three - mile , 10 - minute commutes in @entity8 now take around 10 hours
workers must risk their lives taking buses from one area to the other
the normally short journey is now *impossible* because of snipers
buses must now travel 250 miles through @entity30 checkpoints and the desert
