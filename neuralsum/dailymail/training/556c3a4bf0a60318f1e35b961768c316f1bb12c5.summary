jailed : @entity0 was convicted of money laundering and given a 10 - year prison sentence a mother - of - three has won the right to demand a bigger divorce payout from her ex-husband - after he was jailed for handling cash for a £ 50million fraudster			1
@entity9 accepted £ 270,000 and the family @entity11 from solicitor @entity0 in 2004 after divorcing him for alleged adultery and unreasonable behaviour			1
but in 2010 he was jailed for ten years for money laundering after a court heard he helped millionaire @entity17 politician @entity16 steal around £ 50million from the oil - rich state he governed			1
now she has been granted permission to seek a bigger payout in @entity24 's highest court after claiming he had not disclosed his full wealth when she agreed to the original settlement			0
it is the latest stage in a lengthy legal battle by @entity31			0
in june 2012 a high court judge agreed she could fight the case , and a hearing was fixed for june this year			0
but in march three @entity37 judges unanimously quashed that ruling and the hearing was cancelled			0
now , however , mrs @entity9 has now won permission to take her case to the @entity41 - where she will stand alongside a second woman fighting her own ex-husband			1
mrs @entity44 , from @entity45 , will fight the case next june with 46 - year - old @entity47 , who is battling her software millionaire ex-husband			0
mrs @entity47 accepted £ 10.35million from @entity51 founder @entity50 two years ago after their marriage of 17 years broke down			1
she agreed to the payout thinking it was worth half his fortune - yet his stake in the firm was estimated wildly higher at £ 150million soon afterwards , @entity45 's @entity54 heard			0
@entity61 , a specialist divorce lawyer with mrs @entity9 's solicitors @entity62 , said : ' dishonesty in any legal proceedings should not be tolerated ; the family court should not be an exception			1
' this is yet another case in which an unfair settlement has been agreed because of one party being dishonest and not sharing all the details of their wealth to the courts			0
' we are pleased that the @entity41 has agreed to hear this case alongside @entity47 's			2
battle : mrs @entity9 will fight alongside @entity47 , 46 ( left ) , who accepted £ 10.35m from her ex-husband @entity50 ( right ) in the belief it was half his fortune			1
his firm @entity51 was later valued wildly higher ' both cases raise serious issues about how the courts should handle cases where information shared with the court and used to agree a divorce settlement is later found to be false or incomplete			0
' we believe the situation that both women find themselves in is unfair and that is why we applied for permission to take their cases to the @entity41			2
' in this case the @entity54 judges admitted having sympathy with mrs @entity9 's situation			1
in our view if family law judges , who are given broad discretion to ensure fairness in proceedings , are having to acknowledge this then something in the letter of the law has stopped that fairness from prevailing			0
' there are numerous legal arguments to be heard by the @entity41 but we hope that ultimately justice will be done and will be seen to be done			2
' in the previous hearing , @entity110 offered mrs @entity9 his ' sympathy ' but said it was ' simply not open to the court ' to decide in 2012 about an issue discussed in 2004			1
the judge said that it was apparent that at some stage prior to 2007 ' the husband became involved in offences of fraud and money laundering on an astonishing scale			0
' ' mr @entity0 was an out and out rogue involved in financial criminality on an eye - watering scale , ' @entity110 said			2
landmark : mrs @entity9 's case will be heard alongside that of @entity47 at the @entity41 ( pictured ) ' to the eyes of the wife , and it seems the judge , it was possible to discern at least the outlines of a " smoking gun " indicating that the husband must have had substantial assets in and prior to 2004 , which he deviously failed to disclose in the financial relief proceedings			1
' but there was no evidence @entity9 had met @entity16 before the middle of 2005 - more than a year after the payout was settled , the judge added			2
according to the judge , the jailed ex-husband said his wealth related only to a period after mid- 2005 - and besides , as they have been found to represent proceeds of crime , they can not be taken by his wife			0
the case will be decided after a @entity41 hearing next june .			2

@entity9 accepted £ 270k and @entity11 *car* from @entity0 in 2004
but six years later he was jailed for ten years for part in £ 50million con
he was acting as solicitor for *corrupt* @entity17 governor @entity16
now mrs @entity9 , 50 , will be allowed to ask for more in @entity41
