the case will return to the global spotlight when @entity2 , who is free on bail , appears before the judge for a sentencing hearing on october 13			2
in a statement , three legal groups described a ' wave of criticism ' directed at @entity48 that in some cases could border on hate speech , defamation and contempt of court			1

many legal analysts agreed with the judge 's ruling that @entity2 could not be found guilty of premeditated murder			1
but some believe the law supported a conviction on a lesser murder charge on the grounds that @entity2 knew someone - in his version , a perceived intruder - was behind the toilet door and also knew that firing four bullets into the door could cause that person 's death			1
@entity130 , an associate professor of law at the @entity131 in @entity132 , said in an online analysis that ' there appear to be errors of law ' in @entity13 's judgment			0
