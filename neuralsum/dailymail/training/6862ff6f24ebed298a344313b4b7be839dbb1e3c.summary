@entity0 today tore into the @entity1 , accusing his coalition partners of risking ' chaos ' in the economy			2
the chancellor called on the @entity1 to lay out plans for ' hefty ' income tax rises after the election to deal with the deficit			1
but deputy prime minister @entity10 hit back , and said the @entity11 had to ' come clean ' about closing colleges and libraries , and cutting police budgets to make their figures add up			2
tensions in the coalition have mounted in the wake of mr @entity0 's mini-budget , in which he overhauled stamp duty and targeted non-doms and foreign firms for tax rises , but also admitted dramatic spending cuts were still needed to balance the books			1
the @entity1 sought to insist scrapping the ' slab ' system of stamp duty had been their policy since 2007 , while also claiming credit for increasing the income tax personal allowance to £ 10,600			2
both parties signed up to billions of pounds in spending on roads , housing and flood defences			0
but the prospect of huge spending cuts to eradicate a deficit of £ 91billion has caused bitter divisions			1
the @entity11 say the money can be found entirely through spending cuts , with welfare bearing the brunt			1
but the @entity1 argue a fifth of the money can be raise through extra taxes , including a mansion tax on £ 2million homes			2
mr @entity0 insisted the measure would do little to balance the books and the @entity1 would have to use other hikes to make up the shortfall			0
' it 's hard to work out exactly what they ( the @entity1 ) think , ' mr @entity0 wrote in @entity68			0
' while they sign up to deficit reduction , they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts			1
' but they should n't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone			0
' if you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting , you 'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance			0
' deputy pm @entity10 said the @entity11 had to ' come clean ' about the impact of trying to eradicate the deficit from spending cuts alone in a direct pitch for voters to give the @entity11 an overall majority in 2015 , mr @entity0 insisted both @entity90 and the @entity1 were a risk to the economy			1
the chancellor added : ' the battle lines for the general election have been drawn this week			0
there 's a clear choice : a competent plan to stay on course to prosperity with us or a return to economic chaos with all the alternatives			0
' however , mr @entity10 hit back , claiming it was not possible to tackle the deficit through spending cuts alone			2
he told @entity109 's @entity108 show : ' i think it is impossible to balance the books , shrink the state , deliver unfunded tax cuts and protect the public services that people treasure , supporting the police , supporting the @entity118 , the schools and colleges			1
' i do think the @entity121 need to come clean			0
how many colleges will be closed ? how many police need to be taken off our streets ? ' with five months to go until the general election , there are increasingly bitter divisions in the coalition between the two parties			1
public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018 - 19 , according to the @entity135 's forecasts of spending cuts last week mr @entity0 claimed the @entity1 signed up to government spending plans in private but now ' slag them off ' in public			1
after the chancellor presented the details of the @entity22 to the @entity24 on wednesday morning , mr @entity21 described it as ' excellent '			1
but later that day he said he ' did not recognise ' the chancellor 's plan to eliminate the deficit and run a surplus by 2018 - 19			0
he also said : ' we do have differences in emphasis			0
the @entity11 would like to cut spending rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable			2
' ' he told everyone how good he thought it was , and then went out and criticised it , ' said a @entity24 source .			0

bitter divisions in the coalition over cuts to come after 2015 election
@entity0 claims only the @entity11 can ' stay on course to prosperity '
tories insist £ 91billion deficit can be dealt with through spending cuts
but @entity166 dems say tax rises are also needed to protect public services
@entity21 hailed @entity22 as ' excellent ' during @entity24
but hours later he said he did not recognise *conservative* plans for cuts
