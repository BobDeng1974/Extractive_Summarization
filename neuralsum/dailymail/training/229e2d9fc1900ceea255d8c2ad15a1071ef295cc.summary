uncontrollable : the @entity1 warned that once an explicit image is posted online it can be impossible to fully remove tens of thousands of explicit self - portraits taken by teenagers are ending up on websites viewed by paedophiles			1
the naked or sexual pictures are often taken by girls at the request of boys in their classes and sent by mobile phone , in a practice known as ‘ sexting ’			2
but unbeknown to the girls , these photographs may end up being passed around the school and even shared on social networking sites such as @entity21 – then stolen and published on websites used by paedophiles			0
an earlier investigation found boys and girls as young as 13 are routinely swapping naked self - portraits			1
now watchdog the @entity1 has warned that many of these pictures are ending up online			1
@entity30 , chief executive of the charity , said ‘ self - generated ’ pictures of children are now a major source of images used on websites viewed by paedophiles			1
in a search lasting just 40 hours , one of her analysts found 12,224 self - generated images of teenagers on 70 paedophilic websites			1
given the speed of the investigation , the true number of stolen pictures is likely to be far higher			0
at a fringe event at the @entity49 conference , miss @entity30 said she would like to see children taught about the dangers of sexting at school , so they understand that they might never be able to remove every copy of a picture or video that ends up online			0
‘ from our perspective , the younger people know about the risks , the better for us , ’ she said , adding : ‘ take the issue of sexting – we do n’t like the word , but we did a small piece of research last year			2
‘ one analyst spent 40 hours – that ’s all , 40 hours – and every time they came across a self - generated image which had been stolen and put on a paedophilic website , they counted it			1
in 40 hours they found 12,200 self - generated images			1
‘ these are images one teenager had taken of themselves or another teenager shared , which had probably gone around the school and somewhere along the process had been stolen , uploaded and that ’s it			1
’ miss @entity30 also warned that older teenagers could themselves be in contravention of child abuse laws if they send or receive naked pictures – because the law says any such pictures of children under 18 can constitute abuse			2
she said : ‘ one of the things that older young people are not aware is that if you ’re 16 or 17 you might think you are over the age of consent , but if you take an image it ’s still child sexual abuse because it ’s an image of someone under 18			0
there are so many risks they ’re not aware of			0
’ children told the @entity1 that sexting is now considered ‘ mundane and mainstream ’			1
one girl said she was asked for naked pictures ‘ at least two or three times a week ’			0
another said : ‘ one explicit image i took … is coming up on the first page of [ search engines ] , which could jeopardise any future career i have or if any family or friends come across it			2
’ @entity114 , a @entity49 mep for the @entity115 , said : ‘ if your daughter allows one picture of herself to get shared by a friend to a friend who then lets it go on , that picture can get stolen on so many multiple sites that it ’s impossible to ever get it off			0
’ danger : a third of people who sent ' sexts ' said they went to people they had met only online , while 15 per cent had sent images to total strangers ( posed by model ) @entity136 chief executive @entity135 said : ‘ these images are illegal , as they effectively constitute indecent images of children , and it ’s now becoming clear that adult sex offenders are getting hold of them			0
‘ we urge all parents to discuss the risks with their children			0
’ the @entity147 has been campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect children			0
over- 18s would be able to see adult images only if they ‘ opt - in ’ after going through stringent age verification .			2
