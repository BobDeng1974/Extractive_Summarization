a desolate abattoir in a remote corner of @entity2 was last night revealed as one of the main sources of the horse meat in our supermarkets			1
the slaughterhouse dominates the tiny village of @entity10 , in the north east of the country , and makes no secret of the hundreds , if not thousands , of horses it butchers each year			0
visitors to the plant , which employs a fifth of the village ’s 1,000 inhabitants , are greeted by an enormous hoarding displaying a grazing horse next to a cow			0
the other is the firm @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45			0
there is some speculation that some of the horse meat found in supermarkets across @entity51 could belong to their cousins - the donkey			1
a change in the law in @entity2 is being widely linked to the fraudulent sale of meat from the country			2
the authorities are now enforcing road rules meaning that horses and donkeys can no longer pull traditional carts and are banned from major routes			0
this form of transport has been popular in the country for centuries but thousands or even millions of donkeys and horses have been sent to slaughter as there is less use for them , @entity65 , vice-president of the @entity67 agriculture committee has said			0
as a result it is feared that meats contaminated with horse and discovered in @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , may have contained donkey			1
agriculture minister @entity84 last night confirmed the exported horse meat came from the two abattoirs but furiously denied they had been responsible for mis - selling the meat			1
yesterday , @entity89 , general director of @entity25 , admitted to ‘ buying horses from anyone ’ for slaughter but insisted the firm had done nothing wrong			2
he told the @entity96 the firm is now under investigation but said : ‘ everything that we sold was correctly labelled and recorded			2
we sold horse meat as horse meat			1
we are being investigated by the @entity2 authorities			1
‘ officials from the @entity104 have been here			0
we have sold horse meat abroad			1
we do not export horse meat to @entity80 but we export to the @entity108 , @entity81 and @entity109			1
horse meat is a small part of our business – five per cent			2
‘ we buy horses from anyone – people who just pass by or from people who are getting rid of horses from farms that are shutting down or mechanising			0
’ @entity119 , which is owned by the father of a junior @entity2 agriculture minister , also claimed not to have mis - sold horse meat as beef			1
@entity124 , its director , said : ‘ we only exported horse meat as horse meat			1
we did not export any beef in 2012			0
’ today there are concerns that donkey meat from @entity2 may also be entering the food chain			2
a change in the law in the country means horses and donkeys are now banned from the roads			0
as they were traditionally to pull carts thousands if not millions have been slaughtered in recent years			0
@entity65 , vice-president of the @entity67 agriculture committee , has said that their meat could then have been passed on to consumers			0
the director of @entity146 says horsemeat is a small part of the business , around five per cent butchered : an executive said the firm buys horses to slaughter from ' anyone ' a maze of trading between wholesalers has made it increasingly difficult to trace the origins of the meat – enabling horse disguised as beef to be sold in frozen meals across @entity51			1
manufacturing line : workers at the @entity25 factory the horse meat found in @entity82 foods , including @entity169 and @entity171 own label brands , had passed through several countries before ending up on our shelves			1
meat from @entity2 , which exports £ 10million of horse flesh a year , was at first sold to a trader in the @entity108 who was fulfilling an order placed by a @entity180 entrepreneur			1
the @entity180 then sold the meat to @entity80 firm @entity182 – which supplies meat to @entity184 – the company that made meals for @entity169 and @entity171 at their factory in @entity188			2
it appears that while the meat was sent to the @entity108 it was paid for by money sent from @entity180			0
@entity2 ’s prime minister yesterday claimed any fraud over horse meat sold as beef had not happened in his country and he was angered by suggestions it might have been			1
@entity199 said : ‘ there is no breach of @entity51 rules			0
committed by companies from @entity2 or on @entity2 territory			0
‘ i am very angry , to be honest			0
it is very clear that the @entity80 company did not have any direct contract with the @entity2 company and ... it has to be established where the fraud was committed and who is responsible for this fraud			0
’ horse and carts remain a common means of transport in the @entity2 countryside and some can even be seen on the edges of major cities			2
@entity10 employs a fifth of the entire village where it is located industrial : the abattoir exports horsemeat to @entity80 , @entity221 , @entity81 and @entity109 the slaughterhouse dominates the village of just 1,000 people in north - east @entity2 refrigerated vans leave the slaughterhouse to take the meats all over @entity51			1

slaughterhouse is source of horsemeat that has been found on @entity82 shelves
@entity25 confirms it is under investigation from @entity2 authorities
director denies mis - selling : ' we sold horse meat as horse meat '
some of the meat sold in supermarkets could have contained donkey , claims
