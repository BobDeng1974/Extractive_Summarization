what does @entity0 have against the @entity2 ? once again on @entity3 night , @entity0 gave warmly to us with one hand — while cynically taking away with the other			1
the good news is that at least nine @entity2 will fly back across the @entity8 with coveted golden statues			1
but the bad news is that @entity11 — the movie that won @entity13 — is yet another piece of @entity0 ’s @entity16 - bashing junk history that casts us in a poor light			1
although the movie is a cracker — tense and terrifying — like so much that comes out @entity0 , @entity11 plays fast and loose with the facts			2
and unsurprisingly , the brits are given a real pasting			0
for , according to the @entity21 version of the rescue mission , the six embassy staff were refused refuge by @entity2 diplomats			1
‘ brits turned them away , ’ says a senior @entity37 character in the film			2
you can imagine the outraged comments over industrial buckets of popcorn in movie theatres from @entity61 to @entity62			0
‘ @entity63 ! so that ’s what we get for bailing them out during @entity67 ’ the truth , however , could not be more different			0
the @entity2 did give their @entity29 colleagues sanctuary			1
far from being cowards , the @entity54 were heroes			0
many of the @entity2 diplomats then stationed in @entity26 are still alive — and they ’re fuming			1
‘ when i first heard about this film , i was really quite annoyed , ’ says sir @entity72 , 86 , who was our man in @entity74 at the time of the crisis			2
sir @entity72 is understandably concerned that @entity11 will become accepted as the definitive history of what happened			2
he may have a point			0
the movie also stars ' breaking @entity84 ' star @entity83 ( left ) remember u- 571 — the @entity87 thriller set in @entity67 — which saw the @entity88 , and not the @entity2 and the @entity89 , capture an @entity91 coding machine and turn the course of the war ? or how about the abysmal piece of faux - history that was @entity97 ’s @entity96 , which depicted the @entity2 as the rapacious , murderous oppressors of the noble and romantic @entity100 ? who can forget @entity102 , @entity103 ’s @entity67 epic , that effectively presented @entity104 as an exclusively @entity29 effort ? the sad irony is that what really happened in @entity74 in 1979 is just as thrilling as @entity11 , if not more so — and it involved astonishing @entity2 pluck			1
@entity21 may have won the @entity3 for @entity13 , but the movie wo n't be picking up any awards for being historically accurate anytime soon when the @entity28 was overrun by armed students on november 4 , 1979 , five members of staff managed to escape by a side exit			1
the remaining 55 embassy staff were to be held captive for a further 444 days			1
the most senior member of the escaped group was @entity118 , who worked in the visa department			0
he decided the best place to find refuge was the @entity122			0
the group made its way through the bustling streets , only to find the @entity2 embassy was also surrounded by an angry mob			1
thinking on his feet , @entity118 quickly took the group back to his flat and from there tried to contact anybody who might help rescue them			0
after a tense night , a call came through from the @entity2 embassy informing the five terrified @entity29 that it could give them refuge in its residential compound , which was known as @entity136			1
as @entity11 neglects to mention , this was an exceedingly brave offer			0
both the @entity2 embassy and residential compounds were under serious threat			1
after what had happened to the @entity29 , the @entity2 understandably feared an attack on their own staff			1
the @entity26 revolutionaries had dubbed @entity2 the ‘ @entity145 ’ , and for our officials to shelter diplomats from the ‘ @entity145 ’ ( @entity29 ) meant running a huge risk			1
the caller told @entity118 that a @entity2 car would come for them later that morning			1
the @entity29 sat and waited			2
what the five anxious @entity29 could not have known was that the @entity2 rescuers had got @entity155 and @entity156 spent hours fruitlessly negotiating the thronging streets in , of all cars , an orange 1976 @entity159 one of them had driven to @entity74 all the way from @entity162			1
but they were unable to find @entity118 ’s flat			0
at around 5pm , the @entity29 called the @entity2 embassy , only to be told by a diplomat that the @entity26 were ‘ coming over the walls ’			1
a @entity29 hostage , blindfolded and with his hands bound , being displayed to the crowd outside the @entity171 in @entity74 by @entity26 hostage - takers in 1979 the @entity25 revolution in @entity26 in 1979 saw demonstrators climb the wall of the @entity171 to burn a flag in defiance indeed they were			1
for as the city grew dark , an army of students invaded the embassy compound			2
they broke into offices and houses , smashing windows and doors			0
among those who witnessed the attack was @entity189 , wife of the @entity190 , @entity191			0
that night , @entity192 was in her house with her son , @entity194 , who was aged just seven			0
‘ my little boy was terrified , and so was i , ’ she recalls			0
‘ we hid in my bedroom , but then i decided that was not a great place to hide , in case they set fire to the house			0
’ @entity192 left her room , hiding @entity194 under her coat			0
she was soon accosted by six students , all clutching kalashnikovs , one of whom she swore could be no older than 12			0
‘ i thought they were going to shoot me , ’ she says , ‘ but when i realised that they were n’t , i grew angry with them , and asked them if their mothers knew they were out ! ’ along with the other @entity2 embassy staff and their wives and children , @entity192 and @entity194 were taken to a single building where they were held captive			1
although he was in @entity223 at the time , the ambassador sir @entity72 today suspects the students who attacked the @entity2 embassy were looking for the @entity29			1
‘ they claimed they were after arms , ’ says sir @entity72 , ‘ but i do n’t think that was true			0
’ the 10 @entity29 hostages being presented to the media at the occupied @entity29 @entity28 shortly before their release the @entity29 hostages being paraded outside the @entity171 in @entity74 in 1979 meanwhile , @entity155 and @entity156 had finally found @entity118 and his group after hours of driving around the backstreets of @entity74			2
the @entity29 were taken in an edgy drive to the as - yet - untouched @entity2 residential compound			1
‘ the @entity29 were very nervous , ’ @entity155 recalls , ‘ and they kept trying to duck down , which in my view would only look suspicious			2
’ happily , they arrived at @entity241 and received a warm welcome			0
as the @entity37 officer @entity248 , who helped to mount the eventual rescue , recalls in his book , @entity11 : ‘ the @entity2 were kind hosts , and offered them a house of their own , fed them a warm meal , even prepared cocktails			2
’ so much for @entity21 ’s suggestion that the @entity2 ‘ turned away ’ the @entity29			1
@entity155 ’s wife @entity252 cooked that meal and the @entity29 went to bed			2
but while they slept , the @entity26 students were approaching @entity136			2
fired up with the success of storming the @entity2 embassy , they were now ready to seize the residential compound			1
standing at the gate was a @entity260 guard in his 50s called @entity262 , who brilliantly convinced the students the compound was empty — and they went away			0
‘ we and the @entity29 had a very lucky escape , ’ says @entity155			2
‘ we were very grateful to @entity262			0
’ the following morning it was decided the @entity29 would have to move on for their own safety			2
@entity118 and his group were told that they would have to go , as @entity136 was clearly not secure			0
according to the account written by @entity248 , the @entity29 felt they were ‘ being kicked out ’ by the @entity2 , but @entity155 says this is not the case , as the reasons for leaving @entity136 were ‘ self - evident ’			1
freed @entity29 hostages , landing at @entity274 after a flight from @entity26 on their way home to the @entity29 @entity11 tells the story of how 6 @entity29 diplomats were rescued from the occupied @entity29 embassy during the 1979 revolution for a few days the five @entity29 were placed in an empty house belonging to a @entity29 official , where they were joined by a colleague who had also escaped from the embassy and had been in hiding			1
this group of six was eventually saved by the rescue mission organised by the @entity36 and the @entity37			0
after the rescue , the story remained secret , kept in classified files			0
however , the diplomatic community knew the @entity2 — and others — had done their bit			2
a recently - released @entity294 from february 6 , 1980 , states that the @entity2 embassy was involved in the rescue of the @entity29			1
many of the @entity2 embassy staff from that time have seen @entity11			1
‘ it does not bear all that much relation to the facts , ’ observes sir @entity191 drily			0
‘ it is not a true story			0
’ @entity21 has acknowledged the film casts @entity2 in a bad light			1
‘ but i was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go			0
it does not mean to diminish anyone , ’ he said			0
such a defence cuts little ice with sir @entity72			0
‘ i ca n’t see why the film - makers could n’t have acknowledged that we and others did actually help the diplomats , ’ he says			1
‘ it would n’t have ruined the drama at all			0

@entity13 packed with *inaccuracies* regarding the @entity2 involvement in @entity26 revolution
in @entity21 *'s* version six @entity29 embassy staff were refused sanctuary by @entity2 diplomats - quite the *opposite* of what happened
