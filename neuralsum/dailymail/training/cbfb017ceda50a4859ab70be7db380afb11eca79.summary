in april this year , @entity1 's family had almost given up hope			1
the brave six - year - old had been fighting leukaemia for two years , only to relapse for a second time during intensive chemotherapy treatment in february			1
doctors had exhausted all the traditional treatments as @entity1 could not remain in remission for long enough to attempt a bone marrow transplant			1
so her desperate parents , @entity12 and @entity13 , started looking at more radical options			1
' we needed to try something new , different and cutting - edge			0
' so they turned to the @entity26 at @entity27 , which is involved in testing a pioneering new therapy			2
doctors suggested they sign @entity1 up to a clinical trial that would use a disabled form of @entity32 to carry cancer - fighting genes into her t - cells ( disease fighting cells )			1
the hope was that this would re-programme her immune system to recognise the cancer cells and start killing them			1
several adults had already been enrolled in the study at the @entity44 and had responded well , but as it was so new the treatment was n't without risks			0
but time was running out for @entity1 , who is also known as @entity48			2
mr @entity49 said : ' we were told that we were down to 48 hours of making a decision or she could start having organ failure			1
' they comforted themselves with the knowledge that even if the treatment did n't work , it would provide doctors with information that could help them save other sick children			0
so on april 17 , the then six - year - old became the first child to have the therapy known as @entity64			1
@entity1 during her therapy - at first she suffered an adverse reaction , which was treated with an arthritis drug now in remission , @entity1 enjoys walking her dog who comforted her when she was ill @entity1 with her proud parents : ' she has never complained ' they revealed the family had been warned @entity1 could experience flu - like symptoms a few days after her re-engineered t - cells were injected back into her			1
but her symptoms were far more serious than doctors anticipated			0
she became critically ill and was admitted to intensive care at the children 's hospital			0
on april 24 , doctors told her parents she had a one in 1,000 chance of surviving the night			2
trial leader dr @entity82 and his team realised that the level of a certain protein had become very elevated as a result of the t - cells growing in @entity1 's body			1
this same protein is involved in rheumatoid arthritis , and there is a drug for that disease that turns off production of that particular protein			0
the team administered the drug to @entity1 , with dramatic results			2
almost overnight , her breathing improved , her fever dropped and her blood pressure was back to normal			0
mrs @entity1 said @entity1 inspired them with how she coped			2
' she 's extremely smart and creative			0
she 's funny - she makes us laugh all the time			0
she never complains , ' she said			0
@entity1 is very creative according to her parents , and loves playing with her dog @entity105 and @entity13 faced the agonising decision of whether or not to put their daughter forward for a clinical trial emily during a consultation with dr @entity82 and her parents @entity13 and @entity12 dr @entity82 led the clinical trial , which was life - saving for @entity1 her husband added : ' she told us from the beginning that she would continue to fight and do what we asked as long as we were there with her			1
we 've stuck together as a team			0
she 's definitely our hero			0
' several weeks after her t - cell infusion , they were able to conduct a bone marrow test to find out if the therapy had worked			2
' three weeks after receiving the treatment , she was in remission , ' said dr @entity82			0
@entity1 was diagnosed with the most common childhood cancer , acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( all ) in may 2010			1
unfortunately her case , like 15 per cent of sufferers , was resistant to traditional treatment			0
she was put forward for an experimental therapy known as @entity64			1
in certain cancers , including the type of all that @entity1 was battling , a subset of cells in the immune system become leukaemia			1
these are called b cells			2
another set of cells in the immune system , called t - cells , normally recognise and attack invading disease			1
but in cancers like all , the abnormal leukemia cells fly under the radar of the normal t - cells that are meant to kill them			2
in the experimental treatment , her t - cells were collected from her blood , then re-engineered in a lab to recognise and attach to a protein called @entity159 that is found only on the surface of b cells			2
to do this they used a gutted hiv virus , called a lentivirus , to carry special receptors into the t - cells			2
there is no risk of hiv infection from a lentivirus			0
when the re-engineered cells were put back they dispersed throughout the body to find and kill cancerous b cells			1
@entity1 had an additional drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis to tackle a side - effect of the therapy and has been in remission for seven months			1
' @entity1 completely responded to her t - cell therapy			1
we checked her bone marrow for the possibility of disease again at three months and six months out from her treatment , and she still has no disease whatsoever			0
the cancer - fighting t - cells are still there in her body			1
' he added that they need to see the remission go on for a couple of years before they can think about whether she is cured or not			0
but , after spending years in treatment , @entity1 went home in june and now enjoys going to school , playing football and walking her dog @entity203			1
' t - cell therapy was really the only option left for @entity1 , ' said mr @entity49			1
' but we entered her into the trial really hopeful , and from the very beginning we just really had a good feeling about it			0
so all along we said , " it just has to work , it has to work for @entity1 " – and it did			2
' the scientists said although the results were very promising , much more research needs to be done to see whether the therapy is a viable , safe and long - term solution for controlling certain cancers in children and adults			0
@entity221 , @entity222 at @entity223 , said the results of the study were encouraging for both children and adults diagnosed with leukaemia			0
' treatments which modify the body ’s own immune system to fight leukaemia have shown much promise in recent years , ' he said			1
' what is significant about [ the ] therapy is that the severe side - effects associated with this form of treatment seem to be greatly reduced when combined with other drugs			2
' this is a small study of just 12 patients			0
larger clinical trials are needed to determine how effective this treatment could be and as a result it should be some time before it is available in the @entity243			0
' researchers from the @entity245 and @entity27 presented their latest findings at the @entity248 ’s annual meeting in @entity249			0
they found nine out of 12 patients in the trial , which included @entity1 and one other child , responded to the treatment			1
their goal is to treat another 12 patients over the next year			0

@entity1 had been fighting leukaemia for two years but relapsed this spring
her parents put her forward for a clinical trial as it was ' the only option left '
' we had 48 hours to make a decision or @entity1 could have started having organ failure ' , father said
therapy , known as @entity64 , used disabled form of @entity32 to *reprogramme* her immune system to kill cancer cells
