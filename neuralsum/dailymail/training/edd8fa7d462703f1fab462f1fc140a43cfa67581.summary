published : 09:34 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 21 february 2013 two families have discovered that they have been raising each others daughters after the girls were swapped at birth 14 years ago			1
the @entity4 and the @entity5 , from the @entity7 @entity6 , only learned the truth after a dna test was carried out to establish the paternity of @entity11 when she was 12			1
to the astonishment of her mother @entity14 and father @entity16 , the results showed the girl they had brought up from birth was not their biological daughter			2
instead , she was the child of @entity20 and @entity21 , who had in turn raised @entity14 and @entity16 's girl @entity24			2
the parents now ' share ' their daughters , although they have struggled with how differently their biological children have been raised			1
the @entity4 are @entity28 while the @entity5 are @entity29			1
( left to right ) @entity30 with daughter @entity24 he raised , and @entity11 by @entity32			2
all four were stunned when they heard the daughters had been switched the children with their biological parents , ( left to right ) @entity37 with daughter @entity24 , @entity21 with daughter @entity11 the horrendous mix - up began when @entity14 , 32 , from @entity40 in the @entity6 and @entity16 , were expecting their first baby in 1998 , @entity38 reported			1
@entity42 , 36 , an ethnic @entity43 , married the then 16 - year - old @entity20 , and their baby was due at the same date			2
the two women gave birth to their daughters on december 17			2
@entity14 gave birth at 1.30am to a girl she called @entity11 , 15 minutes after @entity20 welcomed her baby daughter , called @entity24			0
when both new mothers fell asleep , it is thought that the girls were switched and wrongly tagged as the other			2
when the delighted new parents brought them home , questions were raised over their children 's looks			1
@entity14 's husband @entity16 questioned why their daughter had such dark hair and features , when they were pale and blond , but his wife thought she had picked it up from other family traits			0
@entity24 , her biological mother @entity68 , and @entity30 , his biological daughter @entity11			0
the families stay in touch as they are still reeling from the news @entity42 , @entity14 , @entity11 ( left ) and @entity24 all meet regularly , and the youngsters have grown close since the shocking discovery @entity42 did not question why his daughter was as ' white as sugar ' and thought his baby had taken after her @entity7 mother			1
the problems began when @entity16 became suspicious of @entity11 , and accused @entity14 of cheating on him			0
he accused @entity11 of not being his biological daughter , and demanded a divorce in 2007 , accusing his wife of cheating on him			0
she insisted she had not and , when @entity16 refused to financially support @entity11 , @entity14 took him to court , and a dna test to confirm paternity was arranged in 2010			1
it was then that tests revealed that neither of @entity11 's parents were biologically related to her - she had been swapped at birth			1
after contacting the @entity93 in 2011 , an investigator tracked down @entity30 and , with him , @entity14 's biological daughter , called @entity24			0
@entity14 's wedding to @entity16 , in 1998 , broke down after he became suspicious that their daughter was not his @entity24 , who believed @entity30 was her biological father , pictured as a child			0
the little girl was finally reunited with her biological mother in 2011 @entity11 ( right ) pictured with the mother who raised her , @entity14 , and @entity14 's other baby @entity42 had been blissfully unaware there was an problem and initially refused to meet with the other family , but relented and met his biological daughter , who he described as his ' mirror image '			2
three years on and the families now ' share ' their 14 - year - old daughters , with @entity24 and @entity11 calling both parents ' mama ' and ' @entity110 '			1
the stark cultural differences between the two families meant that it would be impossible for the girls to simply swap back to their biological families			1
they have decided to continue raising each others biological daughters primarily as their own responsibility , but celebrate holidays and birthdays with each other			0
but cultural differences did cause some trouble			2
@entity14 feared that her daughter would marry at a young age in an organised marriage and she would stop communicating with her			0
during a tv show which showed the results of their dna tests , the girls were upset as they learned of the mistake which changed their lives forever the families only found out after extensive dna tests proved the mix up - but they have decided to stay with their families who raised them @entity42 struggled to come to terms with @entity11 's manner of being very open , not shy to talk to boys , and asking for a lot of hugs and kisses from relatives			1
however , @entity42 said that no decisions had been made on any of the children 's future arrangements and the families were attempting to be in as much contact with each other as possible			1
he said : ' first of all we live in the different villages and the second thing is that we have different cultural background , different religions and beliefs			0
' we are just different , but that does n't prevent us from communicating and spending time together			0
' the pair decided to prosecute the hospital for negligence			0
they were awarded six million roubles each ( around $ 200,000 ) , but they are still waiting payment because the maternity hospital has no money			0

( left to right ) @entity24 , who believed @entity30 ( centre ) was her biological father and his blood daughter @entity11			0
the girls have now become friends @entity24 ( left ) , her biological mother @entity68 , and @entity11 ( right ) are all in touch , despite their cultural differences			1

families discovered mistake after dna test over paternity question
girls had been raised by wrong families , one as @entity28 , one as @entity29
families say culture differences make it impossible to switch them back
parents now ' share ' their children as they try to *overcome* mix - up
