three quarters of us drink tea every day but many of us are too impatient to let it steep properly			0
steeping is the act of letting the flavour of the tea infuse into the water , and scientists claim it should be left for a minimum of two minutes			1
but a study has found that 80 per cent of tea drinkers ca n't wait that long - and 40 per cent of us drink it immediately meaning we do n't get the best flavour from our cuppa			1
researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea - drinking habits and found that only 16 % of people let the water brew , or steep , for the recommended time of between two and five minutes			1
nearly half ( 47 per cent ) leave their tea to cool for five minutes after they have removed the tea bag before drinking it the study was commissioned ahead of @entity30 - a 10 - day programme of science , technology , engineering and maths events across the @entity36 that started on 13 march			1
researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea - drinking habits and discovered that @entity38 made without sugar and drunk from a ceramic mug is the most popular method			1
only 16 per cent of people let the water brew for the recommended time of between two and five minutes			1
but this time varies depending on the type of tea			2
and nearly half ( 47 per cent ) leave their tea to cool for five minutes after they have removed the tea bag before drinking it			1
herbal teas ( stock image ) should be steeped in water with a temperature of @entity56 ( 203 ° f ) steeping tea is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours and soften it			1
for standard black tea , freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95 ° @entity66 )			2
water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea , with a recommended temperature of 74 ° @entity70 ( 160 ° f to 203 ° f )			1
oolong tea is best steeped in @entity73 ( 185 ° f ) water			2
herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95 ° c ( 203 ° f )			0
regardless of the temperature , the standard explained that tea should be steeped for six minutes			2
elsewhere , the age - old debate of water or milk first was found to vary depending on how the tea is being drunk			1
if the tea is being made in a cup or mug the milk should be added last , and more than two thirds ( 69 per cent ) of tea drinkers use this technique			1
but when made using a tea pot , the milk should be added to the mug before the tea - infused hot water is poured into it			1
the study additionally found that the over 65s are more likely to add milk first			2
@entity99 , professor of materials and @entity101 at @entity102 said : ' this may be controversial , but the @entity36 do not understand how to make tea ! or at least they ’re not doing it properly			2
' and it ’s because they do n’t understand the variables			0
expediency is causing us to throw chemistry out of the window ; we ’re not allowing our tea to brew for long enough , to release the flavours properly			0
' the decline in use of the teapot is another factor , ' professor @entity99 added : ' what you make tea in , and drink it out of , is also important			0
' these findings follow reports last month that said to make the perfect cup of tea - according to the @entity133 guidelines - the milk should be put in the cup first , the pot must be made of porcelain , there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed @entity73 ( 185 ° f ) when served			1
and these guidelines explained that black tea should be steeped for at six minutes			2
the @entity133 is the business standards company best known for the @entity141			0
this mark is an internationally recognised symbol of excellence and is seen on everything from manholes to aircraft			0
elsewhere the experts said that if tea is being made in a cup or mug the milk should be added last , and more than two thirds ( 69 per cent ) of tea drinkers use this technique			1
but when made using a tea pot , the milk should be added to the mug before the tea - infused hot water is poured into it to a tea : experts say many of us @entity162 are not leaving our tea to steep for long enough the institution 's best practice when it comes to making a cup of tea is called ' preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory tests			1
' according to this standard , two different sized pots made of porcelain or glazed earthenware are recommended , alongside two corresponding small and large ' bowls ' - or cups			2
the first , large pot should measure be between 74mm and 78mm wide and stand between 83mm and 87mm tall			0
it should also have a lid			0
the ideal smaller pot should be between 61mm and 65 mm tall and ideally 64mm wide			0
the larger cup is should be between 57mm and 63mm tall by 109mm - plus or minus 3mm - compared to 49mm and 55mm wide			0
either way , the large pot should not exceed 318ml , and the small pot must have a maximum capacity of 159ml			0
these findings follow reports last month that said to make the perfect cup of tea - according to the @entity133 guidelines - the milk should be put in the cup first , the pot must be made of porcelain , there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed @entity73 ( 185 ° f ) when served on average , a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves so at least two should be used for a small pot and at least four should be used for a larger pot. when being made with milk , the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to at least 2.5ml milk in the bowl to make tea without milk , 2g of tea should be used for every 100ml of water			1
pour freshly boiled water into the pot up to 4mm and 6mm below the brim			0
the tea should then be left to infuse for six minutes			0
@entity220 recently released this tongue - in - cheek colour chart to help friends and family make tea to a person 's preferred strength on average , a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves , so at least two bags should be used for a small pot of tea and at least four should be used for a larger pot. when made with milk , the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to milk in the cup			1
at least 2.5ml milk is recommended for use with a smaller pot , and 5ml milk is advised for the larger pot. this helps the milk mix more evenly though the ' liquor ' when the tea is added to the bowl			1
to make sure the water does n't scald the milk , the @entity133 explained that its temperature should not exceed @entity73 ( 185 ° f ) , but should be above 60 ° @entity249 ) for optimum flavour and sensation			0
the standard does explain that different sized pots can be used , but these measurements are recommended			0
if milk is added first and the teabag is dropped into the milk before it has infused with the water , then the steeping process is affected			2
it does n't affect the brewing process , but it will cool down the liquid which will directly impact the effectiveness of the steeping			0
dr. @entity266 at @entity267 , @entity265 said : ' when you steep tea leaves in hot water , water - soluble materials are extracted to produce the tea			2
' changes in brewing temperature affect extraction of colour - and flavour - responsible chemicals exponentially			0
' he explained that reaction rates generally double for every rise in temperature of 18 ° f , and decrease by the same factor when the temperature is lowered .			0

the study was commissioned ahead of @entity36 science week
researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea - drinking habits
they found @entity38 made without sugar is the most popular tea
only 16 % of people let the water brew for the recommended time of between two and five minutes
and 47 % remove the bag but leave their tea to cool for five minutes
it follows reports from the @entity306 that said tea should be steeped for six minutes and the milk should be added first
