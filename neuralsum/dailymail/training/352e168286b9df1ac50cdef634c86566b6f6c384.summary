a @entity1 marketing firm is calling @entity2 from @entity3 a fake			1
and they say they 're responsible			0
@entity7 , a company dedicated to ' connecting fans to their fandom ' announced tuesday that they 'd orchestrated the meme 's massive viral popularity			1
' we wanted to see how powerful the fangirl demographic was			0
' the result was one of the most popular , overnight viral memes ever			0
on monday alone , @entity2 from @entity3 was tweeted about some 1 million times			1
@entity2 turned out to be a random , handsome @entity40 teenage @entity3 employee named @entity41			1
by tuesday , @entity43 's @entity29 followers numbered around 500,000 and his good fortune continues to pour forth			0
@entity45 tweeted a photo of herself along with @entity2 and the hashtag # @entity48			1
in addition to internet stardom , it appears @entity2 may have won himself a spot on a holiday @entity3 commercial			1
but was it @entity55 who got him there , or are they just looking to profit from the @entity2 phenomenon ? from the start of the @entity2 from @entity3 craze , everyone appears to agree it was a @entity64 @entity29 user named @entity65 who first tweeted @entity2 's photo			1
not so fast : the undisputed first person to tweet the photo was this @entity64 girl -- she says she 's never heard of @entity7 first saw @entity2 ? @entity40 teen @entity70 ( left ) first tweeted about @entity2 after seeing him at @entity3 in late october			1
her friend @entity72 then responded with the now - infamous pic of @entity2 after seeing him for herself and a meme was born so how did a girl in @entity76 hook up with a @entity78 marketing startup with a handful of employees and an app on the @entity82 boasting all of 30 reviews ? she did n't			2
@entity65 herself says she has no idea who they are			0
' i dont work for breakr wtf i dont even know what it is , ' she tweeted			0
she also shared on tuesday evening some of her not - so - positive feelings about the craze			0
' whatever im so done with this alex s * * * ' she tweeted			0
what 's more , as the @entity97 reports , @entity65 was n't the photographer -- it was more likely a girl named @entity101 , who recognized @entity2 while in line at @entity3 from a tweet her friend had sent previously			1
' @entity70 tweeted about a checkout guy at target being attractive & i soon found myself in his checkout line			0
. remembering @entity70 's tweet , ' @entity110 told the @entity97			2
' i quickly snapped a pic of ' @entity2 from @entity3 ' and tweeted @entity70			2
' neither @entity110 nor @entity70 have had any connections to -- or even heard of @entity55 -- either			0
' i have never heard of @entity7 but a few of my friends are sending me links to the post but i do n't really know what it is , ' @entity110 added			2
viral craze : @entity2 from @entity3 is @entity41 ( right )			2
his skyrocketing popularity appears to have gotten him onto a commercial beside @entity45 , who tweeted this photo popular : celebrities and fangirl teens alike have jumped on the @entity2 from @entity3 bandwagon @entity3 also tweeted their take on @entity2 from @entity3 , though they appear to have had nothing to do with creating the meme			1

a company called @entity7 says they orchestrated the @entity2 phenomenon
however , the first person to tweet the photo claims she got it from @entity136 and is a @entity64 teen while @entity7 is based in @entity1
