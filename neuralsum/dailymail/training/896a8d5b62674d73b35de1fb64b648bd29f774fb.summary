by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:21 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 18:33 est , 8 january 2014 @entity3 embraced the prospect of a @entity6 coalition with the @entity7 yesterday by declaring that @entity8 was a man of ‘ integrity ’			1
in an apparent u-turn , the shadow chancellor said he understood why mr @entity8 went into government with the conservatives and said they recently had a ‘ very friendly and warm ’ chat			1
mr @entity3 ’ intervention indicates that senior @entity6 figures are keen to open the door to a possible deal with the @entity7 after the general election next year			1
@entity6 's shadow chancellor @entity3 now says he could work with @entity8 , who claimed mr @entity3 is the only politician he has a personal feud with thawing relations : mr @entity8 later posted a tweet saying only ' @entity3 ' - a reference to when the shadow sparked an internet phenomenon when by writing just his own name on @entity29 in an interview with the @entity31 , he said : ‘ i understand totally why @entity8 made the decision that he made to go into coalition with the conservatives			1
i may not have liked it at the time , but i understood it			0
’ he added : ‘ i can disagree with @entity8 on some of the things he did but i ’ve no reason to doubt his integrity			2
’ mr @entity3 said he ‘ had a nice chat ’ with the deputy prime minister recently about how things were going			0
‘ the only conversation i ’ve had with @entity8 in the last 18 months was very friendly and warm , ’ he said			2
his comments are significant because he has previously stated that he would not go into government with mr @entity8			2
when the @entity52 / @entity7 coalition was formed in 2010 , senior figures in the @entity6 were furious at what they saw as their natural allies on the left			1
mr @entity3 repeatedly criticised the @entity7 and mr @entity8 in particular , claiming his decision to do a deal with @entity58 ’s @entity52 was ‘ shocking ’ and would make it ‘ very difficult ’ to work with him in future			1
but after the @entity6 lead in the polls halved to around six or seven points in 2013 , senior party now accept that they could be faced with having to form a coalition in 2015			1
the move to so warmly embrace mr @entity8 by one of @entity6 ’s most factional figures will be viewed as a sign of a lack of confidence that @entity72 can become prime minister with an overall majority of his own			1
a senior @entity7 source also played down the idea of a long - lasting rift : ' it 's no secret that @entity3 and @entity8 disagree about a number of issues			1
' but it 's also true that they get on when they speak to each other			0
they are both thick - skinned and capable of having a joke at each other 's expense in the rough and tumble of politics			0
' but ultimately , they are more than capable of a friendly chat when they bump into each other			0
' in a further sign of the thawing of relations , mr @entity8 later posted a tweet saying only ' @entity3 ' - a reference to when the shadow chancellor in april 2009 sparked an internet phenomenon when he wrote just his own name on @entity29			1
the much - mocked gaffe became such a hit that two years later mr @entity3 repeated it to mark the second anniversary of ' @entity105 '			0
mr @entity3 , pictured in the @entity106 today , suggests @entity72 might not secure an overall majority in 2015 november 2011 ' i do n’t think there ’s a single member of the shadow cabinet who ’d find it easy to sit down with @entity8			1
what @entity8 did last year was so shocking'december 2011 ' i could serve in a @entity115 with @entity116 or @entity117 tomorrow			2
i do n't think it 's possible for @entity8 to lead that move ' september 2012 ' @entity3 and i are both clear @entity8 is an obstacle ' january 2013 ‘ i think what you always have to do is deal with politics as you find it			1
we ’ve never , i do n’t think , ever had a cross word			0
’ before christmas mr @entity8 claimed mr @entity3 was the only politician he has a personal feud with			2
the @entity7 leader said : ‘ i always try to keep a good sense of humour , and if i have an argument with someone to keep the argument about what the argument is about and not allow it too often to become sort of personal			0
' i make one exception , for a man named @entity3			0
but other than that i try not to make it about insults and stuff			0
' but in the latest interview mr @entity3 brushed aside the criticism : ‘ i saw that subsequently he made a further statement to one of the newspapers that these things were n’t about personalities , and i think he ’s right about that			0
’ he added that he can ‘ understand totally ’ why mr @entity8 made the decision to go into coalition with the @entity52			1
‘ i may not have liked it at the time , but i understood it			0
i also understood totally his decision to support a credible deficit reduction plan , because it was necessary in 2010			0
’ however he criticised the decision to accelerate the deficit reduction plane , cut the top rate tax cut and cut welfare			0
mr @entity3 added : ‘ i can disagree with @entity8 on some of the things he did but i ’ve no reason to doubt his integrity , we ’ve never , i do n’t think , ever had a cross word			2

shadow chancellor 's in sharp *reversal* after *condemning* deal with @entity52
*balls* used to say @entity8 entering coalition with @entity58 was ' shocking '
but now @entity6 *heavyweight* says he understands reasons
