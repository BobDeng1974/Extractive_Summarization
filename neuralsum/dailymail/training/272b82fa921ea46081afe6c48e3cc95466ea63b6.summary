by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 4:00 pm on 16th january 2012 coup : @entity3 's deal with @entity4 will pour billions in the @entity6 economy @entity6 taxpayers face footing the bill for more rescue money for the @entity11 if euro is to be prevented from derailing the world recovery			1
@entity3 admitted that there was a risk of the economy contracting if @entity17 suffered a deep downturn as forecasters suggest that the @entity6 is already in recession			1
the chancellor said he would go to mps for their approval if the @entity11 made a ' strong case ' for more money			2
' if i felt it was a decent request by the @entity11 , then , of course , i would be willing to go to @entity29 and make that request , ' he said			2
' @entity6 has always been prepared to provide the resources in the past and will be willing to provide the resources in the future if there is a strong case			0
' he also criticised the single currency zone leaders for doing too little to secure confidence			2
' i think what the euro needs to do is show convincingly that it can stand behind its currency , ' he said , adding : ' we have n’t actually seen much evidence of the pooled resources needed by the euro to actually provide confidence to the market that they will stand behind their own currency			1
' he was speaking at the start of a tour of the @entity54 where he announced plans to make @entity58 a key global trading centre in the @entity4 currency			1
@entity54 markets fell slightly on opening today after the weekend downgrades of @entity63 and some other @entity17 economies			0
but there were rises in @entity58 and @entity17 , indicating the dealers expected the news			0
he predicted that high - tech and luxury exports from @entity6 to @entity4 would surge as the country grows			1
' i think @entity6 can come into its own as providing the kind of things that a richer economy of consumers is more likely to need , ' he said			2
in a speech to @entity7 businessmen , mr @entity3 announced plans to develop @entity58 as the @entity82 hub for trading in the @entity4 currency , the renminbi			1
' @entity58 is perfectly placed to act as a gateway for @entity88 banking and investment in @entity17 , and a bridge to the @entity91 , ' mr @entity3 said			1
huge achievement : the deal struck by the chancellor in @entity7 , pictured , will make @entity58 the biggest trading hub for @entity4 currency outside @entity4 ' it reflects @entity58 ’s strength in product development , its regulatory structure and the depth , breadth and international reach of its financial markets			1
' a richer , stronger @entity88 is an opportunity for the world , not a threat — we should be bold enough to say it and to explain it to our own populations			0
' mr @entity3 yesterday reaffirmed that the government would be prepared to make extra funding available to the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) alongside other @entity114 ' if there is a strong case ' but again stressed the cash must go to ' countries , not currencies '			1
' if i felt it was a decent request by the @entity11 , then , of course , i would be willing to go to @entity29 and make that request , ' he said			0
' it would n't ultimately be my decision , it would be a decision of @entity29			0
' but let me be very clear , i would not do that with @entity6 acting alone , like other big @entity114 countries , and we are very clear this is not a substitute for eurozone providing money for dealing with its own currency			1
' his words come amid fresh warnings from two separate sources that the economy is in fact slowly edging back into recession			1
the @entity143 warned the recovery is ‘ paralysed ’ by the eurozone debt crisis and predicted growth of just 0.2 per cent this year			0
both the @entity143 and the @entity147 and @entity148 say that gross domestic product shrank in the final quarter of last year and will fall again in the first three months of 2012			0
a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contracting output			0
the chancellor made his symbolic turn @entity54 in an attempt to show the government is doing all it can to boost growth , while chaos continues to reign in the eurozone			0
speaking during his visit , the chancellor blamed little evidence of the ' pooled resources ' needed to instil confidence in the eurozone			2
in a speech to @entity4 businessmen in @entity7 he promised to throw open the doors of @entity6 plc to @entity88 investors			1
under the agreement , the @entity4 have agreed to keep their trading floors in @entity7 open for five hours longer so that trades in currency can continue while financiers in @entity58 are at work			1
the deal is a major vote of confidence in the @entity180 at a time when it has been under attack from @entity6 ’s @entity17 partners , particularly @entity63 , seeking to curb its influence			1
hours after this deal , which experts say will bring billions to the @entity180 , mr @entity3 sharpened his talons on the state of @entity17 and the @entity190			1
despite pledging the @entity6 would ' weather the storm ' he said greater confidence was needed in the @entity193 to put an end to unstable markets			1
he said : ' i think what the euro needs to do is show convincingly that it can stand behind its currency , ' he told @entity201 's today programme			0
' we have n't actually seen much evidence of the pooled resources needed by the euro to actually provide confidence to the market that they will stand by their own currency			2
' there 's lots of good signs that they are getting there and there are various summits planned for the next few months to ensure those resources are there			0
' but i think that is what they need to do as well as resolve the @entity223 situation , i would say almost more so than the downgrading			0
' the ongoing uncertainty about how they are going to write off some of the private sector debt in @entity223 is an almost greater source of instability in the eurozone			0
' mr @entity3 said the most recent predictions by the @entity232 , which issues official forecasts , showed that @entity6 would have a negative quarter of growth but would not go into recession			1
he told @entity201 's today programme : ' that 's their forecast , but they were the first to say that it is very uncertain and one of the biggest risks to the @entity6 economy is the further deterioration of the eurozone crisis			2
' i said openly at the end of november to the @entity247 when i made my autumn statement that if the eurozone were to go into a deep recession , that would have a real impact on the @entity6 economy			1
warnings : @entity3 said the eurozone needs to work harder to instill confidence it will stand by its own currency ' i 'm confident the @entity6 government is doing everything it can with a very difficult inheritance , facing a very difficult international situation to get @entity6 through this , to weather the storm			1
' turning to his deal with @entity4 the chancellor said exports to the country from @entity6 were up ' dramatically ' over the last two years and demand for services and high - technology products would only grow in the future			1
' i think @entity6 can come into its own as providing the kind of things that a richer economy of consumers are more likely to need , ' he told @entity201 's today programme			2
mr @entity3 said ' enormous ' @entity4 savings meant there were opportunities for investment in @entity6 public infrastructure projects			1
he said : ' there a limit on how much the @entity6 can borrow			0
' but it is also the case that there 's an enormous accumulation of @entity4 savings and a lot of those savings have ended up in investments in government debt , particularly @entity91 government debt , @entity293 debt			0
' i think those savings could be used in investing in @entity6 infrastructure , transport projects , energy projects and the like			0
' coup : @entity3 's deal with @entity4 will pour billions in the @entity6 economy the @entity6 is now the largest source of foreign direct investment to @entity4 from within the @entity302 and @entity6 goods exports to @entity4 rose by 20 per cent last year , and 40 per cent the year before that			1
trade in the renminbi is growing rapidly			0
@entity308 leader @entity307 blasted the chancellor for being prepared to ' gamble ' on offering more money to the @entity11			2
he said : ' once again the chancellor uses this fudge phrase of ' countries not currencies ' , which will hardly fill the @entity6 public with confidence that the @entity6 will not guarantee more @entity6 money to the @entity11 to support failing eurozone countries			1
' the fact that the chancellor is also prepared to go to @entity29 in order to get support to offer more money should alarm us greatly			0
' we are constantly told that the @entity6 is broke , yet the government seems prepared to gamble on offering more money to the @entity11			1
this is something that @entity6 taxpayers will find hard to swallow			0
' while prime minister @entity330 's official spokesman said the chancellor was merely setting out the government 's position on a possible increase in @entity6 funding for the @entity11			2
' he said if there were a strong case for additional resources , then he would be willing to take that case to @entity29 , ' said the spokesman			0
' at the moment , there is a limit of £ 40 billion , of which £ 30 billion has already been subscribed			0
there is a headroom of £ 10 billion			0
if we went beyond that , we would require parliamentary approval			0
' we have always said that we are supporters of the @entity11 and that the @entity11 should continue to play its traditional role of global backstop , providing stability to the world economy			2
' ' if the @entity11 believes it needs more resources , and there is a strong case for that , then the @entity6 would play a role			2
that is a consistent @entity361 position			0
we clearly benefit as a country from the @entity11 playing that role in supporting stability in the global economy			2
' finance ministers of the @entity114 group of the world 's biggest economies , including mr @entity3 , are expected to discuss the level of @entity11 resourcing when they meet in @entity371 next month.end mr @entity3 ’s speech marks the start of a push on the economy			1
@entity330 will outline his plans for responsible capitalism on thursday .			0

deal with @entity4 includes opening the doors of @entity6 plc to @entity88 investors
trading floors in @entity7 will open for five hours longer so currency trade continues while @entity58 financiers are at work
hours after deal @entity3 attacks eurozone for failing to instill confidence needed to secure markets
@entity3 repeats pledge to put more money into the @entity11 , a move which would see the @entity6 contribute £ *15* billion to *bailing* out the euro
