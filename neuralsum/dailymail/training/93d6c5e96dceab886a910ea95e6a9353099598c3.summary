by @entity0 would be astronauts looking to book the trip of a lifetime are being offered the chance to float into space in a high tech balloon			1
a @entity8 company plans on offering the ultimate day trip to near - space in two years time - just enough time to start saving for the £ 95,000 ticket			1
during the flight , passengers will be able to stand up and enjoy fantastic panoramic views of @entity16 , experience weightlessness and even eat a meal if they desire			1
space tourists will journey to earth 's outer limits in a capsule that can hold six people - four passenger and two pilots			1
@entity40 of @entity31 , said : ' the ride will be very gentle and peaceful as well as environmentally friendly			0
' passengers will be able to see the sun and the stars at the same time , while looking down on the curvature of the earth			1
' the passenger pod is carried into near - space by a high tech balloon and then separates after cruising above the earth for two hours			1
it is carried back to @entity16 by a para-foil when passengers will briefly experience zero gravity @entity55 adventurer @entity54 who is one of the few people on the planet to have visited every country , has already signed up for a trip to near - space			1
commercial operations will begin in 2015 but a trip will cost around £ 95,000 per person			2
ms @entity40 said : ' the experience will be very much like that in an aeroplane although there will be a period of about 30 seconds when passengers will experience weightlessness and will be able to float around the cabin			2
' everything is customised to the person 's individual requirements			0
we can partition off part of the cabin for those who want more privacy and we can even serve them @entity82 star meals if that 's what they want			0
' the pod is large enough to carry six passengers - four space tourists and two pilots			1
the company 's ' @entity90 ' are usually used to conduct science experiments in near space zero2infinitydevelops technologies to enable cost - efficient access to near - space with zero - environmental impact flying solutions			2
while it currently offers trips for scientific researchers as well as equipment in its ' @entity90 ' pods , it is targeting couples and families with this new venture			0
@entity31 's largest pod , which carries six people , has 15 square metres of windows for amazing views of the @entity16 and space			2
the company is currently doing test flights and raising more investment for its new venture			0
a @entity90 begins its ascent from the @entity16 's surface ( pictured left ) to an altitude of 36 kilometres			0
they then fly for around two hours at a height that is twice that of @entity122 's cruising altitude an artist 's impression of passengers inside a pod on their journey to near - space the company usually takes researchers and scientific experiments into near - space			1
its balloons offer scientists the chance to so earth and space observations , study atmospheric science , demonstrate technology in zero gravity conditions and conduct drop testing			0
@entity142 recently collaborated with @entity8 university , @entity143 , to send its humanoid robot called @entity145 into space			0
the collaboration aims to advance in the development of robotics by offering a real platform to test university ’s research in robotic intelligence			0
a pod is pictured beside a robot that was sent into space by a @entity8 university to test its research in robotic intelligence			0

ëblooní service will take passengers to near - space - twice as high as @entity122 - where they can experience weightlessness and even eat *dinner* but it will cost £ 95,000 for a pod of four people
space tourists will journey to earth 's outer limits in two years in a capsule that can hold six people ( four people plus two pilots ) *tethered* to a high - tech balloon
they will be able to see the sun and the stars at the same time , while looking down on the curvature of the earth
