the troubled development of the @entity1 now faces a public inquiry in march , throwing into doubt next year 's staging of the @entity6 round of @entity7			1
work should have commenced on the £ 315million motorsports venue on the outskirts of @entity11 in february last year			1
however , the organisation behind the project , the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , have encountered a number of planning permission hurdles			1
circuit of @entity19 chiefs were forced to hand the staging of this season 's @entity6 event to @entity23 despite signing a five - year agreement in august last year to host @entity7 , @entity25 bosses were quickly forced to hand over the staging of this season 's event to @entity23			1
@entity12 then sought permission to de-register 600 acres of common land at @entity31 , @entity32 , the site for the proposed circuit			0
despite belief that would swiftly be granted and work would finally start in december or january , only now has the decision been taken to hold an inquiry , due to commence on march 10 for eight days			0
the inquiry has the support of the @entity25 , with chief executive @entity40 stating : ' the planning process is a lengthy one and we will continue to work with the planning body to ensure on - site works start as soon as possible in 2015			2
last season 's champion @entity45 of @entity47 celebrates on the podium in @entity49 ' we are still aiming to have phase one site - wide and circuit infrastructure ready to host @entity7 when completed			0
' this is a hugely important development , not just for the regeneration of @entity32 , but also for the @entity6 economy			2
' it 's critical we ensure every detail is considered in the planning process before construction works can commence			0
' following the inquiry , and even if permission is eventually granted , @entity12 could yet face a judicial review , which would push development back further			0
any additional delays would then impact on @entity25 's hopes of hosting @entity7 next year .			2

the development of the @entity1 has *hit* further problems
work on the £ 315m venue was *intended* to resume in february last year
an inquiry will now be made after a number of planning permission hurdles
@entity25 chiefs were forced to hand this term 's @entity6 event to @entity23
