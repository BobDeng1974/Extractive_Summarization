by @entity0 published : 00:47 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 07:29 est , 18 september 2013 proven : the @entity2 has dismissed complaints that fairy adverts are ' misleading ' as the company can prove its washing up liquid lasts twice as long as other brands fairy liquid really does last twice as long as rival brands , the advertising watchdog ruled today			1
for more than 60 years , tv viewers have been told that @entity11 lasts twice as long as other washing up liquids , accompanied by the jingle ' now hands that do dishes can feel soft as your face , with mild green @entity11 '			2
although challenges have come and gone , it was not until today that the claim - made since @entity11 first hit our shelves in 1950 - was ' proven '			2
amazingly , it was a complaint from rivals @entity24 which backfired after bosses complained to the @entity2 that the claim in the @entity27 that it lasted ' twice as long ' was misleading and could not be substantiated			1
the @entity2 investigated tv and digital billboard adverts , which showed one bottle of @entity11 against two bottles of an ' unknown ' rival			2
as the advert continues the bottles start emptying , with the one bottle of fairy lasting as long as two bottles of the rival brand			0
a voiceover states : ' generations have trusted @entity11 's cleaning power because it lasts a long , long time			1
and today it lasts twice as long as the next best - selling brand			0
' bosses at @entity24 complained to the @entity2 and challenged claims that @entity11 lasted twice as long as the ' next best - selling brand '			1
@entity24 also challenged whether the ads made a ' fair comparison ' and that the adverts were misleading as they neglected to mention critical information , such as the concentration and size of the bottles			2
the @entity2 , however , cleared the advert , saying it was not misleading as fairy - owned by @entity57 - could prove its claims			2
the advertising watchdog stated : ' the @entity2 noted the ads showed images of the advertised product beside an equals sign and two unbranded bottles of washing - up liquid			0
' the ads also made clear that @entity11 lasted twice as long as the next best - selling brand and that the next best - selling brand was based on @entity85 volume share data , which we understood identified that brand as @entity24			1
' we considered consumers would understand from the shape and comparative size of the bottles that the images were of the 433ml fairy bottles and two 500ml @entity24 bottles			0
celebrity endorsement : @entity96 was unveiled the face of a @entity11 campaign in 2006			0
she was photographed in her sister @entity100 's home by model @entity101 promotion : tv chef @entity103 has also appeared in adverts for @entity11			0
here , he is pictured in 2002 ' in that context , we considered consumers would interpret the ads to mean that a standard 433ml bottle of @entity11 lasted as long as two standard 500ml bottles of @entity24 when used in conditions representative of everyday use			1
' the expert considered the test reflected the practices of consumers and demonstrated that @entity11 lasted at least twice as long as @entity24 ' @entity2 ' we sought expert advice on the robustness of the evidence provided by @entity57			1
' the expert considered the test reflected the practices of consumers and demonstrated that @entity11 lasted at least twice as long as @entity24			1
' on that basis , we considered the claims that @entity11 lasted twice as long as the next best - selling brand had been substantiated			2
' the @entity2 added : ' the ads also made clear that the next best - selling brand was based on @entity85 volume share data , which we understood identified that brand as @entity24			1
famous : actress @entity130 ( left ) first appeared on tv in 1964 aged four in this @entity11 advertisement cleared : the @entity2 found @entity11 was not in breach of guidelines as its adverts ' objectively compared a material , relevant and representative feature of those products ' ' because the ads focused on the mileage of the products , we considered consumers would understand that the comparison was between the longevity of the fairy product and that of the @entity24 product			1
last month the @entity2 ruled @entity149 did not mislead readers of trade magazine @entity151 when promoting the advantages of its 747 - 8 jet over the @entity155 model of rival @entity156 , which had complained to the watchdog			0
@entity149 said its model has a ' 26 per cent cost advantage ' per trip - and is ' 8 per cent more efficient ' in kerosene consumption per seat			0
also in august 2013 , @entity161 's said it would appeal an @entity2 decision to dismiss its complaint on @entity166 's @entity165 comparison scheme			0
@entity161 's said @entity166 's initiative was unfair for comparing own - label products , but the @entity2 stated the basis of @entity166 's scheme was ' clear '			0
' furthermore , we considered the images made clear that a standard 433ml bottle of @entity11 lasted as long as two standard 500ml bottles of @entity24			1
' in comparing the mileage of the products , we considered the ads objectively compared a material , relevant , verifiable and representative feature of those products			0
' we considered information about the concentration of the liquid and the size and price of the bottle was not material information in relation to ads that made clear that the basis of the comparison was the mileage of the products			0
' because the ads objectively compared a material , relevant , verifiable and representative feature of those products and because they did not omit material information in respect of the mileage comparison , we concluded the ads were not in beach			0
' bosses at @entity57 - which make fairy - said it had used the @entity202 ( @entity202 ) test on the ' mileage ' of @entity11 and @entity24 , which showed it lasted twice as long and was ' two times better value than @entity24			1

@entity24 complained to the @entity2 about @entity11 's ads
*argued* @entity11 's claim to last twice as long as other brands is ' misleading '
but the @entity2 backed @entity11 as the company 's claim could be ' substantiated '
