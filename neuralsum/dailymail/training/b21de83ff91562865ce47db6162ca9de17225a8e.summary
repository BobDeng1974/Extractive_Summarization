‘ i 'm not sure how much time was actually passing , but it felt like an eternity			0
eventually , i got some kind of response from my girlfriend who was speaking to the people in the street			0
‘ i was screaming , shouting , trying to get whatever was on me off			0
it just felt like it was not stopping going down , it was crushing , crushing , crushing			0
’ widower : @entity109 told his wife 's inquest how the evening turned into a tragedy he would never forget paramedics , police and an air ambulance rushed to the scene and he was cut out of the wreckage of the @entity118 and treated			2
but mrs @entity3 suffered ‘ devastating ’ head injuries which killed her			1
@entity16 had seen bad weather and high winds that night and the days immediately before			1
mr @entity22 said he had been ‘ discussing how horrendous the wind had been that evening ’ with mrs @entity3			1
he paused several times and spoke very quietly as he told of the impact the tragedy had on him and his girlfriend - and said more could have been done to check the building 's safety given the stormy weather			1
he said : ‘ for myself and my girlfriend , it has changed our lives so much in terms of appreciation that we were lucky in that situation			0
‘ it makes you reflect and we are saddened that all three of us were n't able to come away from this experience			0
’ mr @entity22 , who has only just stopped using crutches because of his injuries , added : ‘ having no way of rationalising how something like this can happen			1
‘ you are not expecting to be worried about travelling home and buildings falling out of the sky			2
’ he said he was still waiting for answers about why the accident happened			2
mr @entity22 said : ‘ people seemed to initially respond saying it was an ” ' act of @entity150 ”			1
i feel that is a bit of “ we ca n't explain what happened ”			0
i feel there could have been a lot more done			0
‘ this is the @entity159			0
that was the last of a recurrence of a few days of bad weather			0
if you were concerned with your building it should be checked and maintained			2
’ ' people seemed to initially respond saying it was an ” ' act of @entity150 ”			0
i feel that is a bit of “ we ca n't explain what happened ”			0
i feel there could have been a lot more done ' @entity22 , passenger according to his website , mr @entity22 joined @entity23 's live band as lead guitarist in october 2010 and performed with her on the @entity179 world tour			1
mrs @entity3 had to be cut from the wreckage of her car , but attempts to resuscitate her failed and she died at the scene from a massive head injury			1

he said : ‘ she was extremely family orientated - with her granddaughter and her sons			0
shortly before she learnt that ( her son ) @entity192 's partner was pregnant again with a girl , which she was overjoyed at			2
’ @entity23 's guitarist : @entity22 had earlier enjoyed a romantic dinner with his girlfriend he added : ‘ it is a number of months since @entity3 was killed , and every single day i miss her very much			1
’ later , the inquest heard that the masonry which fell from the roof of a six - storey @entity204 building , killing mrs @entity3 , was 6ft long and weighed a tonne and a half			1
building expert @entity207 , who inspected the site the next day , said very high winds probably caused the debris to dislodge and crash down			1
a large @entity214 site being dug nearby which reportedly caused vibrations ‘ could be a contributory factor ’ to the building falling			1
mr @entity207 , a chartered structural engineer from @entity216 , said he thought high winds caused the accident			2
he said : ‘ that wind - force hit it with sufficient force that the wall would have tilted at the point of restraint			2
‘ it would have tilted , the brickwork inside would have failed and the wall would have fallen over			0
if you subject it to a high enough force , that would have happened			0
‘ there was nothing that i have seen in looking at the remainder of the building to suggest that it was a badly maintained building			2
’ he added : ‘ in the final instance , it was the wind that brought it down			0
over the years vibrations from @entity239 could have weakened it			2
’ asked if the @entity204 building would pass current building regulations , he told the inquest it was ‘ close to its limit ’ , given wind estimates			1
mr @entity207 said the building 's design meant there were ‘ inherent possibilities of things going wrong ’ and the 6ft parapet which fell was exceptionally large			1
coroner @entity252 suggested @entity16 could be facing a spate of @entity204 and @entity255 building collapses			1
' it is a number of months since @entity3 was killed , and every single day i miss her very much ' @entity258 , widower she said : ' one function , an ancillary function of an inquest , is that the coroner has the power and indeed the duty to report to any person or organisation in the community if evidence comes to light that may prevent loss of life in the future			1
‘ and what i have in my mind is - when is this going to happen again ? when is this going to happen again , not just anywhere in the country , but here in @entity16 ? ' how do were predict what building is going to lose its parapet ? we will have high winds again			1
' mr @entity207 replied : ' we would have to inspect each building '			2
