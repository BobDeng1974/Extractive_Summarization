the mesmerising patterns of our changing climate have been revealed in artistic computer simulations used to analyse global warming			2
the paint - like swirls depict global water - surface temperatures around the world , with the surface texture driven by the rotation of the @entity11			1
using data from various climate models , trapped regions of warmer water , shown in red , are seen adjacent to the @entity17 off the eastern coast of the @entity19 the paint - like swirls of this visualisation depict global water - surface temperatures			1
cool temperatures are shown by blues and warmer temperatures by reds			0
trapped regions of warmer water adjacent to the @entity17 off the eastern coast of the @entity19 indicate the model ’s capability to simulate eddy transport of heat within the ocean , a key component necessary to accurately simulate global climate change the model , by the @entity36 , is used to simulate eddy transportation of heat within the ocean , a key component necessary to accurately simulate climate change			1
these are circular movements of water , counter to a main current , causing a small whirlpool			0
‘ computer models of the global ocean must capture these eddies and their impact on ocean circulation in order to accurately represent the climate system and future climate change , ’ @entity36 says			0
‘ this is difficult because the small size ( 10 – 100 km ) of eddies requires high spatial resolution and substantial computing power ’			0
global ocean surface kinetic - or movement - energy is pictured here			1
the maximum kinetic energy shown by white with minimum values in black			2
color is on a log scale			0
observe the prominent jet stream off the eastern coast of the @entity19 with adjacent eddy rings the world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change , scientists have warned			1
@entity19 researchers claim that the fast onset of global warming is set to alter the way people live , even over short time scales			2
this is according to new evidence which suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25 ° c per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years			0
the analysis was based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world scientists recently announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central @entity95 and have started to alter wind patterns			1
the @entity97 now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance @entity100 will continue through the summer			0
however , they say that the @entity100 conditions are currently ' extremely weak ' and come at a time of the year when the influence of @entity100 on weather patterns usually declines			0
this means that while @entity100 conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer , it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring			0
in another image the ocean surface kinetic energy – or movement energy – is revealed with maximum kinetic energy in white with minimum values in black			2
the illustration shows the prominent jet stream off the eastern coast of the @entity19 with adjacent eddy rings			1
when winds blow across the ocean , kinetic energy is transferred from the wind to water as a result of the friction between the wind and the sea surface			1
sunlight on the oceans also adds thermal energy to the surface layer , and currents carry the thermal energy to other regions of the world .			2
