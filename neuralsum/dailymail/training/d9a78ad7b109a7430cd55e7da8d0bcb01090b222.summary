the study , conducted by @entity39 for the publisher , asked over 2,000 members of the @entity5 public which three books from a list of 30 they considered to be the most valuable			1
the measure for selection was not by popularity or by the enjoyment experienced in reading the book			0
the @entity31 ( pictured ) was voted the most valuable text overall with 37 per cent of the vote			2
interestingly , 37 per cent of people living in the south of the @entity5 voted for @entity22 ’s seminal scientific tome , but 41 per cent of northerners opted for the @entity31 participants were asked to rate the influence and significance their selected books have had on the modern world			1

some 64 per cent of people said titles ponder the meaning of life and explore answers , while 56 per cent said they contain guidelines of how to be a good person			0
@entity101 , editorial director at @entity17 , said : ‘ the results of the survey highlighted some interesting dynamics , with @entity30 on the list - surely one of the most under - read bestsellers ever written , - relatively little on economics despite the financial climate and only two overtly political , fiction titles in the list			0
‘ the first question i had was whether the similar figures for @entity22 and the @entity31 does show a continuing polarisation between the realms of science and religion , or whether in fact it reveals a more balanced approach to ideas for the modern reader			0
‘ how different might the survey have looked a hundred , or even thirty years ago ? how might it look in another thirty years – will @entity22 have taken over ; will the worrying rise of @entity78 ’s relevance continue ; might the @entity87 continue to rise in significance in the @entity5 ; or might advances in dna technology mean that @entity89 grows in stature ? ‘ is it perhaps a list of which books are perceived as having influence or giving understanding , rather than those which we personally read in order to understand the world around us ? ‘ given the age of the majority of titles perhaps our greatest influence on how we understand the world is nowadays as much through media as through books			1
’ just two works of fiction made the top 10 - 1984 ( pictured left ) and @entity80 ( right ) , which the editorial director at @entity17 notes are both highly political			0

survey by @entity155 - based publisher @entity153 ranks the 10 ' most valuable ' books , as voted for by the @entity5 public
participants were asked to rate the influence and significance 30 selected books have had on the modern world - not how *exciting* they were
authors include : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity1 , @entity24 and @entity25
two of the top three titles were written by scientists
votes for the @entity31 highlighted a north / south divide with *southerners* preferring to vote for @entity29 rather than the holy text
