when her beloved husband of more than 30 years suffered a stroke , @entity0 turned to her local council for support			1
the mother - of - two asked if they could provide a care home place , explaining that he had begun to lash out in confusion and she was struggling to cope			1
but mrs @entity0 was stunned when officials refused – and suggested that if her husband was becoming difficult , perhaps she should consider leaving him			1
disgusted : @entity0 , 55 , said she ' felt sick ' when the council said she could perhaps consider leaving her husband who had suffered a stroke when she asked for support the ‘ insulting ’ advice from social workers at @entity18 came after 68 - year - old mr @entity19 was left partially paralysed and prone to bouts of aggressive behaviour after a stroke several weeks ago			1
in a letter to the couple ’s solicitor , a social work manager said that @entity19 ‘ does not have to continue to live with her husband if she no longer wishes ’ , adding : ‘ mr and mrs @entity0 may need to explore the usual processes for couples who no longer wish to remain living together , i.e. take account of savings and assets before separating			1
’ mrs @entity0 , 55 , who has two adult children , said the advice to leave her husband was ‘ insulting and bullying ’			1
she told the @entity36 : ‘ one of the social workers told me i should either sell the house or divorce @entity41 in order to fund his care			2
’ she added : ‘ i love him , i want to care for him but he needs proper nursing care			2
’ mrs @entity0 , from @entity47 in @entity48 , said she attributed the advice to a desire on the part of council managers ‘ to save as much money as possible ’			1
devoted : @entity41 and @entity54 on their wedding day in 1982 - she said the advice to leave him was ' insulting ' mr @entity19 , a former coal miner , and his wife have few assets beyond the house they own			1
and while a council can not seize the home of a couple to pay for care , the value of a house can be taken into account if the only inhabitant is the person who needs a care home place			1
the family ’s solicitor @entity72 said : ‘ my concern is that this gentleman is being refused nursing home care by the local authority because they would be forced to meet the costs			2
’ he said that mr @entity19 ’s stroke left him ‘ with a number of severe medical issues which have left him bedbound ’ , adding that ‘ he has [ also ] developed severe challenging behaviour ’			1
managers at @entity86 have offered @entity88 funding to pay for mr @entity19 ’s medical bills should he enter a nursing home			0
however , the offer is for £ 110 a week – several hundred pounds short of the full bill for a home			0
and social workers have said that mr @entity19 should remain at the couple ’s house , with carers visiting four times a day			0
a letter to mr @entity72 from @entity100 , a social worker based at the hospital , said : ‘ our assessment ... indicates that mr @entity19 ’s needs can be met in the community and a nursing home placement is not essential			0
’ @entity106 , director for care at @entity18 , said the authority could n’t comment on specific care cases			1
however she added : ‘ we support people to return home after a hospital stay where they are able ’ and said social workers are advised not to get involved in residents ’ marital issues			0

elderly residents were subjected to ‘ deplorable ’ physical and emotional abuse over the course of several months – with one even being told she faced eviction and her belongings had been sent to a tip. confused patients also had their hair pulled and were made to pose in degrading positions at the @entity137 - run care home			1

they condemned the ‘ disgusting ’ acts carried out at @entity151 nursing home in @entity152 , @entity153 , after being told by police that the trio saw their actions as ‘ a joke ’			0
the abuse only came to light when an employee blew the whistle on her colleagues , prompting a police investigation			0
the 11 victims were aged 72 to 97 and all but one were female			0
passing sentence at @entity167 , judge @entity168 said the group ‘ showed no humanity or compassion to these elderly victims			0

the deplorable physical and emotional abuse took place at @entity151 nursing home ( pictured ) in @entity153 the catalogue of abuse stretched from january to september 2013 , and included @entity139 pulling the hair of a 90 - year - old dementia sufferer and being photographed looking up the nightdress of a 96 - year - old woman			2
@entity180 also targeted an 82 - year - old retired nurse , telling her she was to be evicted because she had failed to pay her bills , and that her belongings had been sent to a tip. the three carers , who had no previous convictions , have been banned from ever working in the nursing profession again			2
@entity137 said more than 20 members of staff had been suspended from its four homes in the town in the last year , but denied the suspensions were linked to abuse by the trio			0
