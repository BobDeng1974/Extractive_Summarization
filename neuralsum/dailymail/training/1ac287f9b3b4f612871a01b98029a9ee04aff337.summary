by @entity0 @entity1 , founder and ceo of international electronics manufacturer @entity3 , washed an employees car after losing a bet he 's been named one of the top 50 most influential people in tech and has a reported wealth of about $ 315 million			1
but come tuesday , @entity1 got out the suds and a vacuum cleaner to personally hand clean one of his employee 's cars after losing a bet			1
mr @entity1 , the founder and ceo of international electronics manufacturer and online retail business @entity1 , promised to wash the car of anyone who beat him in the 10 kilometre @entity21 charity run almost a year ago			1
the @entity22 raised millionaire , who sponsored 25 people to participate in the race , was eventually beaten by one of his own employees			2
fulfilling his promise , the serial entrepreneur not only spent half an hour of his day scrubbing away at the jeep , but he even let the winner stream it live for the world to see			2
' there was a 10 kilometre charity run almost a year ago and i was trying to motivate as many of my team as possible to enter because we are a tech based business and spend all our time in front of a computer screen , ' mr @entity1 told @entity44			1
' the run was at 7am on sunday morning , so we sent an email around for the whole team and four or five said " i 'm in " , but i thought " nah , we need more people "			0
' it basically meant i trained pretty hard core - i have a business to run so i did n't want to spend the rest of my life washing cars			0
' the award - winning businessman recalled the moment that his employee , a man named @entity71 who he said was fairly modest , overtook him on the track			0
' i remember i had kilometer to go and i was just ahead of him and then i saw him overtake me and sprint towards the finish line – he beat me by like a 100 metres , ' mr @entity1 said			2
it took almost a year for him to fulfill his promise due to @entity71 savoring the moment and waiting for ' the perfect moment ' for his boss to wash his car - which finally arrived after a weekend of off - road driving			1
the video was recorded by the winner and streamed live to the @entity85 company office as well as across the internet despite the bet - winning employee saving the moment until his car was dirty from an off - road driving trip , mr @entity1 said he would use similar tactics to encourage his employees to be active in the future despite the labour , mr @entity1 said he would definitely use similar tactics again to encourage his team to participate in active events in the future , even laughing that the job took him back to his youth			1
' it was all a bit of fun and everyone was a winner – a charity was helped out , we got fitter and one of the staff has one of the cleanest cars in @entity22 , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' i ran a car wash business when i was 10 - years - old , so it was a bit of nostalgia to be honest			0
' when i was 10 , i was living in housing commission flats in @entity113 , @entity22 and i used to wash my parents car for $ 5 once a month , and then we were driving past a billboard one month which was advertising a car wash and it said it would cost only half price of $ 40 for them to wash your car			0
' i saw it and thought " i 'm being ripped off here ! " so i went door knocking in the area asking people if they wanted their car washed for $ 15			0
' before i knew it i was booked out every weekend and had to have a couple of mates with me and we 'd go around with our backpacks washing these cars			0
