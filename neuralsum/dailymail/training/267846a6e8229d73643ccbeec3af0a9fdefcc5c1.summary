by @entity0 gender stereotypes are not yet a thing of the past as a new survey reveals that many people still have strong opinions on which jobs are suitable for men and women			1
two - fifths of @entity11 believe there are some jobs which women should never do , including soldier , mechanic and surgeon			1
a similar proportion think that men are unable to do some jobs properly , such as beautician , florist and nurse			2
at work : but many @entity11 still believe that women should not carry out jobs such as being a builder the survey of 2,000 @entity11 adults carried out by mobile payment service @entity30 revealed that two - thirds of people think men make better plumbers , mechanics and electricians than women			1
just three per cent think that women are better pilots and surgeons than men , even though there is no evidence for this			2
and women are just as likely to stereotype their own sex as men are - only two per cent think they are better at technical jobs than men , with 21 per cent saying men are better			1
conversely , men are assumed to be worse at traditionally ' feminine ' jobs such as primary school teaching			2
some 64 per cent of @entity11 say women are better florists , 76 per cent say women are better nannies , and only three per cent believe that men make better nurses			1
survey : this graph shows that people still ascribe traditional gender stereotypes to certain careers @entity65 , 25 , from @entity66 , @entity67 , who has been a gas engineer for six years and has now started her own company , @entity70 , said : ' there has been a lot of gender discrimination in my career so far			0
' training was tough and people assume i wo n't be as good as a male engineer			0
i 've been so stressed about this at times that i nearly threw the towel in			0
' but instead of giving into the stereotypes , i saw a gap in the market - lots of women feel safer letting me into their home than they would a man			0
the study was carried out on november 4 by research agency @entity89 which conducted an online survey of 2,026 @entity11 adults from consumer panel @entity92 @entity11			0
it found that many people said they would not trust a professional because of their gender , with 19 per cent insisting they would not trust a male nanny , 18 per cent would not trust a male beautician and 16 per cent would not trust a man working as a midwife			2
distrustful : many people said they would not accept the likes of male midwives and female mechanics meanwhile , while five out of six @entity11 would be happy being treated by a male nurse , 11 per cent would feel uncomfortable and five per cent would demand to be seen by a female nurse instead			1
17 per cent of people said they would be annoyed to see a female mechanic working on their car - and two per cent would leave the garage in this situation			1
shockingly , three per cent of @entity11 said that if they found out that they were about to fly on a plane piloted by a woman , they would refuse to board , get off the plane or make an official complaint			1
@entity120 , managing director of @entity30 , said : ' we 're disappointed to see that their lives may still be blighted by these outdated stereotypes			0
' our service is designed to help businesses of every sector , whether they are run by men or women			0
' and while our study suggests there is still a way to go before we are able to achieve equality in the workplace , attitudes are changing for the better			0

two - fifths believe there are some jobs which women should never do
3 *%* of people would refuse to fly on a plane with a female pilot
and a fifth of @entity11 do not trust men working in ' feminine ' jobs
