by @entity0 published : 16:15 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 16:24 est , 12 april 2013 despite a @entity3 prophecy , the world did not end on december 21 last year - but new evidence suggests the ancient civilisation 's calendar system was , in other respects , accurate			1
by re-analysing a wooden beam from a @entity11 temple , originally radiocarbon - tested in 1960 , scientists believe it shows the @entity14 culture did collapse a thousand years ago because it failed to cope with climate change - a proposition first suggested last year			1
the @entity18 people had developed a sophisticated society , accurate calendars and complex architecture including pyramids			2
they thrived during rainy periods but a prolonged drought somewhere between ad 800 and 1100 is said to have brought about its collapse			1
for a long time , experts struggled to match dates from the @entity29 with the modern @entity31 calendar			1
despite a @entity3 prophecy , the world did not end on december 21 last year - but new evidence suggests the ancient civilisation 's calendar system was , in other respects , accurate			1
above , the @entity37 pyramid at the @entity39 site in the @entity40 of @entity41 the long count system comprised 20 - day cycles made up of k'in , which formed 360 - day cycles known as tuns			1
another unit , b'ak'tun , represented a cycle of 400 years - and it was the ending of one of these that led to the belief of the apocalypse in 2012			2
now , archaeologist @entity56 , from @entity57 , has applied modern carbon dating methods to a lintel , carved with historical records , found at @entity61 , which was a major @entity3 city , according to @entity62			1
his aim was to confirm the accuracy of the dating : 50 years ago , other researchers at the university reckoned the beam had been carved between ad 695 and 712			1
' when looking at how climate affects the @entity71 , i began to question how accurately the two calendars correlated using those methods , ' @entity56 said			2
as well as using carbon isotopes to establish its age , he and his team looked at the tree rings in the wood			1
the date they concluded was around ad 658 - 696 , which backed up the original correlation estimates			1
by re-analysing a wooden beam from a @entity11 temple , originally radiocarbon - tested in 1960 , scientists believe it shows the @entity14 culture did collapse a thousand years ago because it failed to cope with climate change			1
above , a @entity3 pyramid in @entity91 , @entity18 the two estimates match up even more closely after factoring in the removal of ten to 15 years of wood growth while the carving took place , the researchers said in the journal @entity99			2
the lintel they analysed concerned the defeat of @entity103 ' , king of the nearby city of @entity106 , by @entity61 's leader @entity107			1
this is turned re-confirmed the theory that the victory was in ad 695 , 13 years after @entity107 took to the throne			1
their report in the journal continued : ' these events and those recorded at cities throughout the @entity118 can now be harmonized with greater assurance to other environmental , climatic and archaeological datasets			2
' maya rulers commissioned monuments to record events rainfall and the ' war index ' from @entity3 times in a project led by scientists from @entity57 and @entity130 last year , with expert input from @entity132 , precisely - dated rainfall records were made from deposits in local caves			1
this was compared against a so - called ' war index ' , the dates of hostile events which @entity14 people recorded on stone monuments			2
researchers , who it is claimed have made a unique timeline linking changes in culture and climate , found war and unrest matched periods of drought			1
previously , when conditions were favourable with plentiful rain , the @entity14 civilisation expanded into large cities			2
the findings , published in the journal @entity157 , described how maya rulers commissioned monuments to record events and the research team found the frequency of texts carved in stone indicating rivalry , war and alliances increased significantly between ad 660 and 900 , during the drying trend			1
at the time , professor @entity56 said : ' it is not just climate drying and drought that is important , but the preceding conditions that helped stimulate societal complexity and population expansion			0
' this set the stage for societal stress and the fragmentation of political institutions later in time as conditions became drier			0
' @entity182 rainfall figures were calculated from chemical analysis of stalagmites in the @entity186 caves in @entity41			0
dr @entity187 , of @entity132 's @entity188 , led the cave monitoring portion of the study			0
he said : ' the rise and fall of @entity3 civilisation is an example of a sophisticated civilisation failing to adapt successfully to climate change			0
' periods of high rainfall increased the productivity of @entity14 agricultural systems and led to a population boom and resource overexploitation			0
' the progressively drier climate then led to political destabilisation and warfare as resources were depleted			0
' after years of hardship , a nearly century - long drought from 1020 sealed the fate of the @entity209			0
' the theory of climate change being to blame for the end of the @entity209 civilisation has been suggested previously , but the link was controversial because of uncertainties over dating rainfall patterns			0
the @entity209 region covers portions of @entity219 , @entity41 , @entity11 and @entity220			1
' here you had an amazing state - level society that had created calendars , magnificent architecture , works of art , and was engaged in trade throughout @entity18 , ' said @entity229 anthropology professor and co-author @entity228			0
' they were incredible craftspersons , proficient in agriculture , statesmanship and warfare — and within about 80 years , it fell completely apart			0
' it 's a cautionary tale about how fragile our political structure might be			0
' are we in danger the same way the @entity209 were in danger ? i do n't know			0
' but i suspect that just before their rapid descent and disappearance , @entity14 political elites were quite confident about their achievements			0
' periods of high and increasing rainfall coincided with a rise in population and political centres between ad 300 and 660			1
a climate reversal and drying trend between ad 660 and 1000 triggered political competition , increased warfare , overall sociopolitical instability , and finally , political collapse			2
this was followed by an extended drought between ad 1020 and 1100 that likely corresponded with crop failures , death , famine , migration and , ultimately , the collapse of the @entity14 population			2
professor @entity56 's research team collected a stalagmite from a cave in @entity41 , less than 1 mile from the @entity14 site of @entity270 and about 18 miles from three other important centers			0
using oxygen isotope dating in 0.1mm increments along the length of the stalagmite , the scientists uncovered a physical record of rainfall over the past 2,000 years			0
combined , the stalagmite and hieroglyphs allowed the researchers to link precipitation to politics			0
a stone carving of the @entity286 symbol from @entity91 in @entity287 , @entity219			0

lintel from @entity11 temple was originally carbon dated in 1960
@entity293 shows carvings on it were made around ad 696
results help prove correlation of @entity29 calendar with modern @entity31 one
