by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 1 november 2013 as many as a quarter of teenagers abuse their boyfriend or girlfriend , according to a study published today			1
almost half of the young people interviewed also said that they had been abused in their relationships , leading experts to demand that the government take action			1
the abuse ranges from emotional abuse , for example controlling where a girlfriend or boyfriend can go , to physical and even sexual assault			2
abuse : the study , which surveyed 1,203 children aged 13 - 14 , found that almost half had experienced physical , emotional or sexual abuse ( photo posed by model ) the findings are the result of a survey of 1,203 schoolchildren carried out as part of a major project examining attitudes to domestic abuse in young people			1
the three - year from @entity35 study , led by professor @entity36 of the @entity37 , also found that some children thought that it was acceptable to hit your partner in some circumstances			1
around 17 per cent of boys asked said it was alright to hit your girlfriend if she hit you first , and 11.5 per cent of girls agreed			0
a notable minority said that it was alright to hit a boyfriend or girlfriend when he or she hit out first , or if they found out their partner had been unfaithful both boys and girls thought it was more acceptable for a girl to hit a boy than vice versa			1
the from @entity35 project surveyed 1,203 schoolchildren aged 13 - 14 , and found that : the study also looks at how young people refer to domestic abuse - and found out that young people were much more likely to use gentler terms such as ' put downs ' or ' fights ' to refer to incidents of abuse			2
in - depth interviews with young men who abused their girlfriends were particularly likely to refers to their actions as ' fights ' , which they were not prepared to ' lose ' for fear of seeming weak			2
interviews with abusers found that many of them would say that domestic abuse was unacceptable in general , but find excuses when asked about their own actions			0
professor @entity36 said : ' for these groups of young men , many of whom are already outside mainstream schooling , there are limits to what curriculum based learning can do			1
a more comprehensive programme of intervention is needed			0
' the experience of living with fathers who have been cruel and sadistic , makes it harder for them to recognise what they see as less calculating forms of violence as abuse			0
' and some of those who have behaved in controlling ways towards partners are , nevertheless , desperate not to become the kinds of abusive men their fathers were			0
shocking : the above statistics show how many of the 1,203 pupils surveyed have been abused by boyfriends or girlfriends hurt : 17 per cent of teenagers surveyed had experienced physical abuse ( photo posed by model ) ' while i have been conducting research in this area for 15 years , i would still struggle to know where best to refer a young man who was beginning to behave in an abusive way to a partner or other family members			2
' while most young men will say domestic violence is wrong , few actually know how to challenge other people who are abusive without resorting to violence			0
' for this reason , child protection services need to also anticipate the ongoing challenges fatherhood and intimate relationships present to young men who have grown up around abuse , neglect and addiction problems			0

survey of more than 1,200 schoolchildren finds that abuse is *widespread*
almost half of those interviewed said they had been abused
nearly a fifth said that they had been physically abused
a minority said that sometimes hitting a partner is acceptable
professor @entity36 , who led study , demands action
