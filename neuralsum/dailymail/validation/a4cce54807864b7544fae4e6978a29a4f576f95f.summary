a high - profile @entity1 prosecution of the renowned @entity2 in @entity3 has spectacularly collapsed amid claims that the hunt was the victim of a politically inspired campaign , funded by a mystery backer			1
the @entity10 's joint master @entity9 has accused the @entity1 – which brought the prosecution – of co-ordinating a campaign of harassment and surveillance over more than three years , in a failed attempt to prove the hunt had broken the law			1
he also claimed a wealthy anti-hunting businessman intent on landing a ' prize scalp ' had bankrolled surveillance of him , his employees and hunt followers , saying : ' we believe the campaign is funded by a @entity3 - based company			1
a high - profile @entity1 prosecution of the renowned @entity2 in @entity3 has spectacularly collapsed amid claims that the hunt was the victim of a politically inspired campaign @entity2 saboteurs at our meets this year were all wearing t - shirts advertising the firm			1
we do n't believe that to be a coincidence but a statement			0
' the animal rights organisation , which has been criticised for spending £ 22.5 million pursuing animal welfare prosecutions last year , formally withdrew its case on friday – after admitting it had no realistic chance of a conviction			1
mr @entity9 , whose joint master of the @entity10 is one of the richest women in @entity40 , the @entity42 mrs @entity41 , claimed the campaign had been ' focused and sophisticated '			1
he went on to say : ' despite the endless footage taken of us by so - called covert investigators , this is the only time anyone associated with the @entity10 has ever faced a charge and now it has been dropped			0
@entity10 's joint master @entity9 ( pictured ) claimed a wealthy anti-hunting businessman intent on landing a ' prize scalp ' had bankrolled surveillance of him ' i 'm afraid the time has long passed when we thought these people were seriously interested in the law			1
as far as we are concerned , this is just another way of attacking people who participate in hunting			0
' yesterday , the pro-hunting @entity61 said the @entity1 was at a crossroads , and would have to decide whether to continue to bring what it described as ' malicious ' cases or ' embrace sanity and change tactics '			2
mr @entity9 's solicitor , @entity68 , claimed that the case had been flawed from the start			1
he explained : ' there is video footage of my client laying legal trails before and after the alleged breach of the hunting ban which was not disclosed to us by the @entity1			2
' he said the laying of a trail , or a scent which the hounds can track rather than chasing a live animal , showed that the @entity10 had behaved responsibly , not recklessly as the prosecution claimed			2
@entity10 chairman @entity86 said : ' we are very pleased that common sense has prevailed and the case has been dropped			0
the hunt and all its staff , in particular @entity9 as master , make every effort to hunt within the law and be seen to do so			1
we are glad that our stance has been so demonstrably and categorically vindicated by the court			0
' the @entity1 has the power to bring its own prosecutions rather than rely on the police or the @entity100			2
however last october , a report commissioned by the charity recommended abandoning the policy and leaving the job to the @entity100 , which has more expertise			0
an animal rights organisation formally withdrew its case against the hunt ( pcitured ) on friday – after admitting it had no realistic chance of a conviction last year , @entity111 reported that the @entity1 had spent £ 22.5 million on prosecutions in two years , and had been obliged to take out an overdraft facility with its bank , @entity115 , for the first time in its 190 - year history			1
discussing the dropped prosecution yesterday , an @entity1 spokesman said : ' we have not at any stage been made aware of a trail being laid or of any alleged footage of such a trail being laid			2
but having considered all the evidence now available , we concluded there no longer remains a realistic prospect of securing a conviction			0
' addressing the @entity10 's claim that the @entity1 had mounted a campaign of surveillance , he said : ' this is an outrageous slur and completely untrue			1
we did not monitor this hunt			0
the @entity1 does not monitor any hunts			2
' he went on to reject the claim that the prosecution had been effectively paid for by a wealthy backer , insisting : ' this prosecution was funded by the @entity1			1
' @entity141 , the @entity40 director of the @entity142 – which shot the disputed footage and provided it to the @entity1 – said : ' we are very disappointed that the case has been dropped			2
we do understand the reasons and the difficulties in getting these cases through the courts			0
but we stand by our evidence completely ; this case was dropped , not lost			0
' he went on to say : ' we have now reached the reluctant conclusion that having tried everything under the current judicial system , we now need to make changes to strengthen the @entity156			0
time and time again , hunts flout the law and escape prosecution by using the false alibi that they were trail hunting			0
the pro-hunt lobby continually drag out cases and waste public and charity funds			0
