by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a @entity4 amusement park that was as famous for the many lawsuits brought against it as it was for its rides , with no fewer than six people losing their lives there and 110 people reported injuries in a single year			1
since it closed in 1996 , @entity14 became the stuff of urban legend and nostalgia , even inspiring a documentary called ' @entity19 ever			1
' and as of june 14 , @entity14 is back , complete with a new attraction , the @entity20 , which drops riders through a trapdoor and down a 100 - foot - high slide , which @entity14 's owners says is the tallest of its kind			1
' the rides defied any kind of procedure			2
' the rural resort drew thousands of revelers everyday from 1978 until 1996 in spite of - or maybe because of - its freewheeling reputation for danger			1
' we 'd race some unsuspecting guy on the @entity53 , ' said @entity54 , 44 , who worked at the park as a teenager in the 1980s			2
' we 'd be at the bottom and see the cart come down by itself			0
next thing you know , they 'd be bringing the guy to first aid			0
' @entity54 was one of roughly 100 former employees who gathered for a reunion at the legendary water park on saturday to celebrate its rechristening			2
@entity14 closed in 1996 and reopened two years later as @entity68			1
owners decided to switch back to the original name in an attempt to capitalize on the nostalgia - some might say notoriety - of its earlier heyday			2
safety first : the newly - opened @entity14 adheres to the @entity77 regulations write caption here one of the first waterparks in the country , @entity14 opened in 1978 , sometimes introducing new attractions almost as soon they were invented			1
' pretty much any backyard inventor with a crazy idea knew this was the place to try it out , ' said @entity85 , president of @entity86 , which owns @entity14			1
one such ride was only in action for a month before it was shut down			0
the @entity89 was a water slide with a 360 - degree loop at the end			2
a man who claims his father built the slide told @entity96 that stories about dismembered crash - test dummies are completely true			0
' the story about the dummies is completely true ! they used the dummies to test several of the rides at the park and every time a dummy came off the ride dismembered they would try it again until it stayed in one piece , then they would pay someone to test it ! ' he said			1
@entity115 @entity42 the @entity89 : the slide with it 's 360 - degree loop was short - lived , in action only a month before it caused too many injuries and was shut down fun for the whole family : despite its safety track record , @entity14 is remembered with fondness by many children of the ' 80s and ' 90s @entity127 , who worked at the park from 1979 to 1984 recounted watching operators turn on the wave pool ( also known as the ' grave pool ' , at the time one of the first in the country , for the first time			1
he heard a scream and saw a woman clinging to the side of the wall , her feet above the water			0
' she did n't realize that when the wave went through , there 'd be nothing underneath her , ' @entity127 said			0
the park earned a reputation for danger and six people died there from 1980 to 1987			1
news accounts from the @entity151 in the 1980s reported hundreds of lawsuits in little more than a few years			0
the @entity53 was the site of 26 head injuries and 14 fractures in a two - year period			0
executives at the newly renamed @entity14 hope they can resurrect that reputation for risk without the actual danger			1
the @entity53 and a seldom - used waterslide known as the @entity89 have been removed			0
reporter @entity162 recently took the plunge on the @entity165 ride and lived to tell the tale in a tour of the park on saturday , @entity85 stressed that the state inspects rides at the beginning and end of the season , plus conducts periodic checks during the season			1
some of the former employees expressed a sense of nostalgia for a time when kids and teenagers roamed free and a little bit of danger was associated with growing up			0
' when you are the first to do something , you do it without regulation , ' said @entity188 , 39 , who worked at the park from 1990 to 1995			0
' @entity14 is from a moment in time that can never happen again			2
' former park employee @entity191 , 40 , remembers seeing wipeouts on the @entity53 that left kids with scrapes severe enough to require a trip to the first - aid office but not immobilizing enough to keep them from soon returning to the same ride			2
' they 'd be bleeding and jump right into the pools , ' he said			0
' i do n't even know how much chlorine they put in the pool			0
