a badly ill toddler 's life was saved thanks to a replica of her heart made with a 3d printer			1
two - year - old @entity6 was born with a hole in the wall between two chambers of her heart which left her struggling to survive			1
exhausted from pumping blood around the hole , which was initially feared too big to treat , she was left breathless and could n't eat - even her hair would n't grow			2
thriving at last : two - year - old @entity6 was born with a hole in the wall between two chambers of her heart but surgeons were able to fix it thanks to a 3d facsimile of the organ printed in plastic but after doctors at @entity23 in @entity24 created a precise copy of her tiny heart , including its defect , they were able to perfect the complicated procedure needed to cure @entity6			1
it meant when surgeons finally operated on the tiny girl they knew exactly what they were looking for and what to do when they found out			0
' @entity36 is like a normal little girl now , ' her mother @entity33 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , told @entity39 science editor @entity38			0
' she is eating , has stopped being sick and is growing at last			0
' @entity6 was born with a heart so deformed that doctors said it could not be repaired			1
with a hole between her ventricles , the two pumps that circulate blood to the heart and the lungs , she was left constantly tired , sickly and unable to put on weight , her mother told the @entity39			2
her only hope was for surgeons to try to patch the hole , but toddlers ' hearts are so small that even the most experienced paedatric heart specialists find them difficult to handle , making any operation risky			1
but thanks to the 3d model of her heart , based on the magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity62 ) and computerised tomography scans , surgeons were able to design a bespoke patch and understand how it needed to be stitched into place			2
pioneering technique : dr @entity68 , who has pioneered the use of the 3d - printing technique at @entity71 ' , said the model he and colleagues created helped them tailor the @entity76 patch stitched into @entity6 's heart professor @entity78 led the operating team			1
he told the @entity80 had a ' very complex ' hole in her heart - the kind of case that can pose a ' huge intellectual challenge '			2
' the 3d printing meant we could create a model of her heart and then see the inside of it with a replica of the hole as it looked when the heart was pumping , ' he said			2
' we could go into the operation with a much better idea of what we would find			0
' dr @entity68 , who has pioneered the use of the 3d - printing technique at @entity71 ' , said the model he and colleagues created also helped them tailor the @entity76 patch stitched into @entity6 's heart			1
the use of 3d - printed ' practice organs ' made to measure from mri scans of patients promises to become an important surgical tool in coming years			0
the process has featured in @entity108 and surgeons at a @entity110 created a @entity112 heart that saved the life of a two - week - old baby			1
and in @entity117 an entrepreneur with a 3d printing services company persuaded doctors to let him help them by making a model of his own kidney when he needed an operation to remove a kidney stone			0
medics say having the plastic kidney slashed an hour from his two - hour kidney stone removal operation earlier this month and the hospital is now trialling the process with 21 other patients			0
@entity129 , of @entity130 , said : it makes our job easier going in			0
' the 3d model helps because it gives us a rough estimation of where to come from and to be more precise			0

@entity6 was born with a hole between two chambers of her heart
surgeons made a precise @entity112 copy of the organ to work out how to fix it
it helped them understand what to do when they carried out the surgery
