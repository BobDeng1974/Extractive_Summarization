by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:05 est , 22 february 2014 @entity3 : 22:32 est , 23 february 2014 seven @entity5 ski instructors have been arrested in @entity6 and were yesterday all facing prison sentences for providing lessons without a licence			2
it is all part of an increasingly bitter ' @entity11 ' which makes a mockery of @entity14 free labour laws			0
@entity15 , an @entity16 who runs a tour business in the resort of @entity19 , was snatched off a ski lift by armed @entity6 officers on tuesday , along with his six colleagues			1
controversy : from left , @entity15 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 may			2
mr @entity15 , mr @entity25 and another man were arrested and held overnight in a police cell ' they are accused of breaking employment laws ' , said bonneville prosecutor @entity35 , who confirmed all were expected in a criminal court within the next two months			1
' mr @entity15 is not conforming to our laws , ' said mr @entity35 , who said all those arrested had their passports withdrawn			1
those arrested and held overnight in a police cell were mr @entity15 , @entity44 , 63 , and @entity25 , 41			1
also arrested and facing charges , but not imprisoned , were @entity24 , 21 , @entity47 , 45 , @entity26 , 28 , and @entity28 , 47			0
@entity27 , a 48 - year - old female instructor , was questioned by @entity6 police , but not formally arrested			2
a furious mr @entity15 , who is on bail and due to face a judge on april 7 , said : ' i have all the right documentation to work in @entity6 , and so do my staff			1
' i was arrested illegally and then placed in a tiny , freezing cell with a concrete slab as a bed			0
i was kept in custody for 36 hours and generally treated appallingly			0
now we ca n't leave the country , and are all facing further time in prison			0
' he added : ' the gendarmes and other officials surrounded me and incorrectly accused me of teaching without qualifications			0
in fact my only real crime was being @entity5 and not @entity6			0
' i was treated like a criminal instead of someone who is running a successful local business			0
' arrests : mr @entity15 was snatched off a ski lift by armed @entity6 officers on tuesday , with his six colleagues the seven instructors - six men and one woman - face up to three months in prison for working without a licence			1
mr @entity15 , a highly experienced professional , has worked in @entity19 for almost 30 years , mainly with @entity5 holidaymakers			1
but he claims that he and his staff are regularly harassed by the @entity6 , who want to maintain their part of the @entity86 as a preserve of mainly local workers			0
ski professionals from the @entity5 believe the @entity6 are trying to drive them off the slopes - so ruining peoples ' holidays in the process			2
tensions have increased over the past years , as @entity14 employment laws allow more and more people to travel and seek work in neighbouring countries			0
outrage : @entity99 's @entity98 said , ' those raging @entity101 who claim there is a single market should read this story and weep ' mr @entity15 was first fined the equivalent of around Â£ 8,000 in 2004 and last year was given a similar fine , together with a six month prison sentence			2
the latter punishment is currently under appeal			0
mr @entity15 is also facing charges of failing to declare foreign employees - something he considers ' particularly ridiculous ' because @entity6 and the @entity5 are @entity14 allies whose nationals are allowed to work in either country without permits			1
@entity118 commissioner @entity117 , who is also a prominent @entity6 mp , devised a @entity119 ( @entity119 ) as a means of allowing advanced ski instructors to work wherever they want , and it is recognised by the @entity6 government			1
mr @entity15 has a stamp proving that he has an mou , but it is apparently being ignored by the judicial authorities in @entity126 , and by the police			1
@entity128 , mr @entity15 's lawyer , confirmed he had ' every right ' to operate under a @entity5 licence			2
' mr @entity15 is not a criminal but is being treated as one , ' said mr @entity128 , who said his client had filed a complaint with the @entity135 accusing @entity6 of discrimination and restricting his freedom of movement			1
when one of mr @entity15 's staff was arrested last year , scores of holidaymakers staged a demonstration outside the @entity19 police station where he was held			1
commenting on the latest case , @entity5 @entity99 deputy leader @entity98 said : ' those raging @entity101 who claim there is a single market should read this story and weep			0
' they have simply misled people as this episode shows			0
@entity15 has been treated like a dog by @entity6 authorities because he is a @entity5 national who wanted to work as a ski instructor and run a thriving business			2

@entity15 snatched from ski lift in resort of @entity19 by armed police
six colleagues - five men , one woman - also face up to three months in jail
despite mr @entity15 owning special permit recognised by @entity6 government
