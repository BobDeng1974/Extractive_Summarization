the hijackers then turned the plane north instead of south - heading towards @entity27 airspace			2
a veteran of an elite unit in the @entity30 who understood @entity32 , @entity3 appears to have immediately understood what was happening and challenged the terrorists , who were armed with box - cutters and knives			1
it was an act of extraordinary courage which was to cost him his life			0
as the former commando fought with @entity43 , one of the five who had taken the plane , he was fatally stabbed			0
half an hour later , at 8.46am , the @entity46 became the first plane to crash into the @entity14			0
all 81 passengers , nine crew members and the two pilots died			0
the story of @entity3 's unimaginable bravery has only just been made public in a new biography @entity54 : the brief , remarkable life of @entity3 , the genius who transformed the @entity58			2
author @entity59 said she wanted to write about @entity3 's life because she felt it deserved to be celebrated			2
she told @entity62 : ' it was about the way he lived			0
i felt like if he was motivating me as much , i felt like i could do the same for readers			0
' the writer was able to piece together his last moments from the desperate accounts of two flight attendants who had been in contact with the ground as the tragedy unfolded			0

the @entity81 is shown burning after @entity16 crashed a little over 15 minutes earlier as news of terrorist attacks spread around the world , it was @entity127 's own technology which allowed the internet to keep up with the increased amount of traffic			2
the @entity132 - @entity131 co-founded @entity133 which is responsible for more than 30 per cent of the world ’s internet traffic			1
his company 's october 1999 share market float made @entity3 an overnight billionaire and he became one of the world 's richest high - tech entrepreneurs before he was even 30 - years - old			1
the multibillion dollar company 's clients today still include @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 but before his business success , @entity3 , who was brought up in @entity150 , @entity151 , before moving to @entity132 with his family when he was 14 , served with one of the country ’s most elite counter-terrorism unit , @entity156			1

the fourth plane crashed in @entity115 after reaching the rank of captain , he decided to return to graduate school to study maths and computer science			0
he studied at the @entity132 @entity177 before going on to @entity178 ( @entity178 ) on a full scholarship where he came up with a ground - breaking idea to allow the internet to work more efficiently and at faster speeds			1
the set of algorithms he created and called ' consistent hashing ' formed the basis of his company @entity133 which he set up with @entity178 professor @entity188 in 1998			1
describing @entity3 , @entity188 told @entity62 : ' he was really exceptionally smart			2
@entity178 has a lot of really smart people , and @entity3 stood out even among that rarified environment			2
in memory : a plaque for @entity3 on the fence of a park named in his memory in @entity197 , @entity23 , where he studied at @entity178 gone but not forgotten : after @entity3 's death , the intersection of @entity199 and @entity200 in @entity197 , @entity23 , was renamed @entity202 in his honor success story : @entity3 created a set of ground - breaking algorithms which make the internet work more efficiently and formed the basis of his company @entity133 which he co-founded with @entity178 professor @entity188 in 1998 ' he liked working on the hardest problems , as opposed to the easier ones , because they would make more of a difference			1
' he added he was intrigued by @entity3 's idea because it would make a real beneficial impact on the world			2
he said : ' in the area where we worked , in algorithms and the theoretical side of computer science , often that work is good , deep work , but it does n't change the world			0
it does n't impact people directly			0
' with this work , we thought it would have relevance in the real world , and make the @entity228 be faster , more reliable , more secure			0
it was a chance that was pretty rare for us			0
