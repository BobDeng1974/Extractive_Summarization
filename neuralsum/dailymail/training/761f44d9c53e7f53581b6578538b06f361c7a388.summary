prince @entity0 has admitted that speaking his mind is ‘ in his blood ’ as he revisited communities in @entity3 blighted by flooding earlier this year			1
the heir to the throne was today meeting local residents in the village of @entity11 where , back in in february , he shamed both the government and @entity14 into finally responding to the crisis when he said : ‘ the tragedy is that nothing happened for so long			1
’ unlike his last visit , when he was forced to travel by boat and trailer , @entity0 arrived by car and marvelled at the once waterlogged countryside , covered in wildflowers and bathed in sunshine			1
although the future king is often lambasted for his so - called ‘ meddling ’ in national politics , in @entity11 they could n’t have been more grateful for his stance after the ‘ shameful neglect ’ of the authorities earlier this year			1
among those queuing up to thank the prince was farmer @entity51 , 59 , of @entity52 , who told him that his visit and subsequent lobbying to get local rivers dredged – blamed by many for the some of the worst flooding in generations - has achieved ‘ more last february than we have achieved in the last ten years of campaigning ’			1
the prince replied : ‘ well i had to do something			2
it runs in the family			0
it ’s in my blood			0
’ he added : ‘ at least i ’ve done some good			0
’ shocking : prince @entity0 perches on a ' throne ' atop a tractor trailer during his first visit in february all smiles : this time around , the @entity0 was able to enjoy a glass of @entity29 and a sunny day he also chatted at length to another elderly local farmer , @entity72 , and his family who have now farmed @entity74 in @entity75 for five generations			1
his grandson , @entity77 , said : ‘ we had a really terrible year in 2012 as a result of the flooding and to have it happen again so soon after ploughing hundreds of thousands of pounds to keep the farm going was just devastating			0
we had to think seriously about whether we could carry on this year			0
’ @entity0 visited the family farm , which had 250 acres of land under water , back in february			1
‘ his visit genuinely got momentum behind the relief effort and he has clearly made an effort to keep that momentum going			2
we owe the prince a lot , ’ mr @entity77 said			2
mr @entity72 added : ‘ the politicians were n’t listening , the @entity14 were n’t listening			0
no - one was listening until prince @entity0 came down			1
we have got to thank prince @entity0 for a lot of that publicity we subsequently received here			1
’ @entity0 ’s first visit of the day was to @entity98 , where he was accompanied by festival organiser @entity99 , as part of a publicity drive to encourage tourists back to @entity3 following the winter crisis			1
royal wave : prince @entity0 waves to villagers following his second visit to the flood - hit village of @entity31 tourism : earlier , the prince had joined tourism chiefs and @entity99 for a tour of @entity98 historic : @entity98 is thought to contain the tomb of the legendary @entity115 the @entity98 , which sits on the edge of the @entity39 , is one of the most beautiful spots in the area and is home to the tomb of the legendary @entity115 and his @entity121			1
thought to have been the site of @entity123 , @entity98 is also associated with @entity124 who is said to have founded the now ruined abbey in the first century			2
more recently , the @entity98 was used as the resting place for several @entity128 kings , among them the battling @entity129 who fought off the @entity131 only to die shortly afterwards , leaving @entity132 to the tender mercies of @entity134 and his @entity131 empire			1
then it was onto @entity11 where he met members of the local rural community at @entity140 , a 900 - year - old wedding venue owned and run by the @entity143 family			0
although the venue suffered less water damage than many properties it was completely cut off for weeks on end and with prospective clients unable to view the property has suffered a large downturn in bookings			0
adorable : prince @entity0 meets baby @entity153 , five months , during his visit to @entity156 railway station all smiles : prince @entity0 was on cheerful form as he met the baby and his parents before returning to @entity161 @entity162 , 29 , said : ‘ it was hell , to be honest			1
very surreal being cut off for weeks on end unable to do anything about it and with no end in sight			0
the situation was horribly isolating			0
‘ when prince @entity0 came down to visit us we thought things were on the turn but the next day the rains came back with a vengeance			1
‘ her mother @entity175 , 53 , also explained : ‘ we had been wandering around , aimlessly , for weeks on end , without knowing what to do			0
‘ i had been emailing everyone i could think of – the local council , the @entity14 and even @entity181 but no - one bothered to reply			0
then prince @entity0 came to the area and suddenly , within 24 hours , everyone could n’t reply quick enough			1
except @entity183 – i never heard from him			0
’ lovely to meet you : prince @entity0 shakes hands with @entity153 's father @entity186 , 37 , from @entity187 on his way : prince @entity0 prepares to board a train bound for @entity161 after his day out in @entity3 her daughter added : ‘ we have been knocked really quite badly by what has happened			1
the place was derelict and had n’t even been opened for six years when we took it over two years ago			2
' it ’s now the oldest wedding barn in @entity132 and has been a real labour of love			0
but no - one could get to us to view the barn and bookings have been hit			0
‘ it ’s wonderful that the prince is continuing to take such an interest			2
the footage of the floods was undeniably shocking but we want to put out a message of recovery and hope			2
’ although he arrived by car , @entity0 made a point of taking the train back to @entity161 for his evening engagement to highlight the quick links between @entity161 and @entity3			2
the prince , who does not travel by rail very often , took his seat in a @entity218 carriage alongside astonished fellow travellers			0
unsurprisingly the train was n’t late - and arrived in @entity161 on time .			0
