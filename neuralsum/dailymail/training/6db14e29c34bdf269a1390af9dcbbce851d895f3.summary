the clip begins with @entity84 and @entity86 ’s first encounter when a shy @entity87 goes to interview the successful businessman at his opulent offices - and the sexual tension is palpable right from the get go			1

look at me , ’ the nervous literature student responds as the camera pans out , capturing his high rise office in all its glory			0
@entity29 portrays @entity41 in the @entity101 trailer and all the innocence of @entity4 is ruined ‘ to what do you owe your success , ’ @entity87 questions			1
‘ i exercise control at all things , miss @entity109 , ’ @entity86 tells			2
soon the tranquil mood vanishes and the pair ’s intense , adventurous romance begins			1
‘ i ’m incapable of leaving you alone			0
i do n’t do romance			2
my tastes are very singular			0
you would n’t understand , ’ a controlling @entity86 warns			0
but eager - to - please @entity87 does n’t think twice			2
‘ enlighten me then , ’ she says			0
raunchy : the trailer features glimpses of kinky love scenes between the couple @entity10 is the most popular animated film of all time and its @entity58 - winning song @entity59 has inspired countless parodies including @entity126 , @entity62 and a father sick of the musical who sings ' let it go , let it go , i 'm gon na smash the radio ' not long now ! 50 @entity133 will be released on @entity134 next year a long process : after several setbacks , including actor @entity138 quitting the role of @entity41 at the last minute , the crew finally began filming in december last year as the haunting slowed - down remix of @entity144 ’s @entity143 lingers in the background , viewers are shown a kinky montage of the couple ’s journey			1
the film , which is directed by @entity150 , will be released on @entity134 next year and boasts a star studded cast with the likes of @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			2
after several setbacks , including actor @entity138 quitting the role of @entity41 at the last minute , the crew finally began filming in december last year in @entity158			1
last year @entity16 , 32 , opened up to @entity159 about taking on the role following @entity138 's shock departure			0
their biggest movie yet ! @entity164 had small parts in @entity166 and @entity167 while @entity16 has appeared in @entity168 and beyond the rave good bedfellows : ' that 's a big part of it ... having trust , ' @entity170 explained of their job ' you know , one door closes , another opens			0
when [ @entity138 ] dropped out , i did n't instantly think , " oh here we go , maybe i should cancel that holiday , " but i did feel that maybe we 'd revisit the idea of me ' the @entity180 - born actor explained			2
as for doing @entity86 justice the father of one , who welcomed his first daughter with wife @entity187 in november last year , told : ' i 've never felt that @entity86 needs to be some kind of monster , but i think it 's very clear how he conditions himself and looks after himself			0
' ' i take decent enough care of myself anyway , so obviously i 'm gon na up it slightly with training , but we do n't have any intention to really bulk up			0
i do n't think it 's appropriate			0
' daring : in one scene , @entity86 slides his hands up @entity87 's skirt as they sit at the dinner table with family experimenting : @entity87 and @entity86 do n't hold back when it comes to exploring in the bedroom tumultuous : @entity87 soon realises @entity86 is controlling meanwhile , landing the coveted role of @entity41 was a huge coup for 24 - year - old @entity164 , whose parents are @entity211 and @entity212 , and it 's expected this role will sky - rocket her career			1
despite the raunchy nature of the film , the actress was comfortable filming the sex scenes			2
' i do n't have any problem doing anything			0
the secret is i have no shame , ' she said to @entity226 last year			0
' reading the book , i found myself more interested in the ways they were breaking each other down emotionally than the sex scenes			0
i think there 's a part of a woman that wants to be the thing that breaks a man down , ' @entity164 added			0
not so hot ! ' it 's not , like , a romantic situation			0
it 's more , like , technical and choreographed and less			0
it 's more of a task , ' @entity164 said of filming the sex scenes mum and dad are banned ! understandably @entity164 wo n't be letting her famous parents watch the film			2

@entity49 user @entity47 has taken the @entity4 smash frozen to a very different – and kinky - place with a new mash - up trailer
it pairs the dialogue from the @entity41 trailer with clips of the most popular animated film of all time
the end result adds an altogether steamier undercurrent to @entity261 and @entity29 ’s romance missing from the @entity265 - rated cartoon princess musical
as a stand - in for @entity41 , prince @entity27 is eerily appropriate as the manipulative prince has much in common with control - freak corporate titan
