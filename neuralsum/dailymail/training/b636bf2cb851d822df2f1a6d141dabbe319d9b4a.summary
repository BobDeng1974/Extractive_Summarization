@entity1 warplanes blasted an islamic state terror network in @entity3 yesterday killing jihadists operating underground			2
@entity6 fighter bombers dropped 500lb @entity8 laser guided bombs on a huge bunker and tunnel complex used by fighters avoiding coalition airstrikes			1
the dug - in position was only discovered when @entity16 aircraft wiped out a vehicle belonging to militants – leading to smoke to billow from holes in the ground hundreds of metres away			1
they returned with some 30 aircraft from seven different countries and blasted the site so nothing was left behind			1
defence sources told the @entity41 : ‘ we are not sure what they were doing under there , but they are not doing it now			2
‘ it was quite an extensive network , perhaps a hundred metres by a hundred metres			2
it was a sensible tactic to start digging underground – it was using common sense			2
’ the @entity49 said the attack early yesterday was launched to back an offensive by @entity53 fighters northwest of the oil city of @entity55			1
a statement said reconnaissance had spotted a ‘ well concealed network of fighting positions and underground facilities , and confirmed that the site was well removed from any civilian communities			2
’ it continued : ‘ given the significance of the target , and the obstacle it posed to further peshmerga advances , aircraft from seven coalition nations conducted a comprehensive and closely coordinated attack on complex early on wednesday			1
’ fighters faced with an onslaught of hundreds of strikes against their vehicles have begun changing tactics and reducing their use of convoys			1
@entity80 , a researcher for @entity81 @entity82 said : ‘ they have been known to change tactics to try and avoid airstrikes but i had n’t heard of them digging underground before			0
’ @entity88 jihadists had previously ditched convoy for motorcycles , bicycles and camouflaged cars in order to avoid being targeted by airstrikes			0
they also warned their fighters to stop using mobile phones so their location could not be pinpointed by western intelligence			0
earlier in the week , unmanned @entity100 drones discovered a bulldozer in @entity3 and used hellfire missile to destroy it			0
further details were not released for security reasons			0
defence secretary , @entity105 , said : ‘ the strike will have dealt a blow to the @entity26 network in a key location , thus limiting their ability to pursue their brutality against the civilian population of @entity3			1
’ elsewhere in @entity3 attacks continued as @entity116 jihadists fight to spread their control over large swathes of the country			0
yesterday a suicide attack has left at least five people dead in @entity122 , the capital of @entity3 ’s autonomous @entity53 region			0
