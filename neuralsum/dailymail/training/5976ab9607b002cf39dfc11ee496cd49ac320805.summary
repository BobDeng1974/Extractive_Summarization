by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 8 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:33 est , 8 december 2013 with its 18 - carat rose gold casing and a stunning sparkle that comes courtesy of 395 white diamonds , it 's safe to say that the @entity10 phone is n't your average handset			1
the £ 35,000 phone is part of a collection so luxurious it leaves @entity18 's slick new @entity17 looking thoroughly cheap and not at all cheerful			2
designed by @entity22 's @entity21 , other phones in the range are crafted from precious metals , jewels and exotic skins			1
a phone fit for a billionaire : designer @entity21 is behind the £ 35,000 @entity10 mobile other luxury features include an ultra-bombé sapphire crystal screen and high - tech android - powered connectivity			1
but not every phone in the range is sparkling with diamonds			1
among the 11 models available is the sleek @entity37 which has a simple inky leather cover , albeit one crafted from alligator skin			1
and should you have the cash to spare , the phones have gone on sale in the @entity44 at - where else ? - luxury department store , @entity46			1
' we carefully select the best diamonds and set them using the ‘ serti neige ’ or ‘ snow setting ’ technique , ' reveals the brand on its website			2
' stones of differing diameters sit side - by - side , covering the precious metal to enhance the organic curves of each piece			0
luxury : other @entity61 models come encased in iguana ( left ) and python ( right ) with rose gold fittings outlet : the ultra-luxe phones are available from the @entity66 at @entity68 department store @entity46 ' where baguette diamonds are used , @entity21 employs a seamless setting technique for an immaculate finish			1
' expensive though they might be , the @entity61 range , which is based in @entity73 and made its debut at @entity75 last summer , is n't the only mobile phone range that will leave you at risk of a serious talking to from your bank manager			2
@entity22 watchmaker @entity82 has also created a range of luxury phones , including models that come encased in exotic skins and decorated with jewels			1
the @entity89 range , which is sold at @entity90 , includes the @entity91 , which is covered in rose alligator skin and is embellished with 47 precious stones			1
even more luxurious is the @entity95 model , which along with white alligator casing , is decked with 211 shimmering white diamonds			0
each of the phones in the @entity100 range also comes with a complimentary concierge service , which , according to the brand , can get everything from reservations in the world 's most exclusive restaurants to tickets to sold out shows			1
precious stones : @entity82 's phones come embellished with white diamonds and pink sapphires over recent years , pink sapphires have become an increasingly popular part of the jewellers ' repertoire			2
but not everyone is sold on the stones			2
in her book , buried treasure : travels through @entity122 , author @entity120 reveals that the gems are n't quite what they seem			0
chemically rubies and sapphires are identical and are both a gemstone variety of the mineral corundum ( aluminium oxide )			0
but while sapphires get their colour from trace amounts of other elements such as titanium , copper and magnesium , only rubies contain traces of chromium - the only material to impart a pink or red colour			0
as a result , writes @entity120 , while its perfectly possible to get purple , yellow or even green sapphires , there is no such thing as a pink or red one			0
for jewellers , this creates a problem , as rubies are graded by their colour			0
@entity155 ' pigeon 's blood ' red is considered the most valuable while pale pink is virtually worthless - so much so that unscrupulous dealers will attempt to heat them in a bid to darken the colour , despite a 50 per cent chance that they 'll explode instead			0
so what do you get when you buy a pink ' sapphire ' ? the answer is a low grade ruby - a classification endorsed by trade bodies such as @entity171 which does n't recognise pink sapphires			0
like brown diamonds , pink sapphires might be pretty , but in reality , they are n't nearly as valuable as you might think .			0

the handset is the work of @entity22 designer @entity21
@entity21 range includes 11 different models , all encased in exotic skins
phones are sold in the @entity44 exclusively at department store @entity46
