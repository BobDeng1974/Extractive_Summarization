by @entity0 published : 12:49 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 15:46 est , 6 september 2013 serial entrepreneur @entity1 has invented a gesture - controlled 3d printing system for rocket parts inspired by the design process in the @entity6 film			1
mr @entity1 had teased his creation on @entity8 in recent weeks but has now released a video demonstrating the technology , which combines custom - made computer software , a virtual reality headset and a cutting - edge printer			1
the inventor , who recently unveiled his vision for a ' hyperloop ' high - speed super tube , uses hand gestures and a @entity19 controller to assemble wire frame blueprints for a part that could be used for a @entity23 rocket			1
' it 's a fun way to interface with what is a complex model , ' he said			0
an @entity48 immersive virtual reality headset as well as free - standing glass projector screens of the type seen in the @entity6 films , can be used with the software , the @entity46 reported			0
mr @entity1 said : ' if you can go [ into a computer programme ] and do what you need to do , understanding the fundamentals of how the thing should work - as opposed to thinking how to make a computer make it work - you can achieve a lot more in a shorter period of time			0
' @entity1 has invented a gesture - controlled 3d printing system inspired by the @entity6 film he believes humans currently interact with computers in an unnatural way and it is difficult to create @entity69 objects using 2d tools			1
the final part of the video sees mr @entity1 print the rocket component with a 3d laser metal printer , which lays down fine particles of titanium over an initial metal layer			2
the particles are melted with a laser and are built up layer by layer to produce the object drawn using hand gestures on the computer			2
mr @entity1 said the process really allows designers to apply their intuition and turn an idea into a physical object			0
he said : ' we 're on the verge of a major breakthrough in design and manufacturing			0
' earlier this week he teased the technology on @entity8 with an update that read : ' we figured out how to design rocket parts just w hand movements through the air ( seriously )			1
now need a high frame rate holograph generator			0
' he magically puts the parts together in mid-air using hand gestures to manipulate the rocket part as well as to zoom in and out , before showcasing a 3d model of the engine part ( pictured ) a @entity48 immersive virtual reality headset as well as free - standing glass projector screens ( pictured ) of the type seen in the @entity6 films , can be used with the software he said his invention was inspired by the design process in @entity6 and ' we saw it in the movie and made it real , ' in another tweet to the film 's director , @entity30			1
the entrepreneur has previously been compared to the film 's character @entity6 but mr @entity1 insists he has no plans to create a suit for himself like the film 's protagonist			1
he tweeted : ' and , uhh no ( zillionth person who asked ) , i am not going to make an @entity131 suit , however design by hand - manipulated hologram is actually useful			0
' the final part of the video sees mr @entity1 print the rocket component - a cryogenic bell housing - with a 3d laser metal printer ( pictured ) , which lays down fine particles of titanium over an initial metal layer			2
the circle in the picture is the beginning of the 3d rocket part mr @entity1 believes ' we 're on the verge of a major breakthrough in design and manufacturing			2
' this is the rocket component that is produced at the end of the technical process			0

@entity1 has invented a gesture - controlled 3d printing system for rocket parts inspired by the design process in the first @entity6 film
the entrepreneur had teased his creation on @entity8 in recent weeks has now released a video demonstrating the technology
in the video he uses hand gestures and a *special* controller to assemble wire frame blueprints that could be sued in a @entity23 rocket
