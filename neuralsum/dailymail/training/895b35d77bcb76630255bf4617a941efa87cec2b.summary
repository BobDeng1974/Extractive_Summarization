by @entity0 for the @entity1 inside the draw hall in @entity4 on thursday afternoon , it will be the turn of the greatest names in the @entity6 to enter the competition for real			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are among the star turns who will be hunched around television sets at training grounds all over @entity18			0
at @entity19 , the man who engineered @entity22 ’s squeaky qualifying win at the @entity23 over @entity24 , will be itching for the chance to compete with the best midfielders in @entity18			1
it feels like now or never			0
it was only a year or so ago that former @entity39 captain @entity38 guaranteed increased scrutiny on the midfielder by elevating him into the world class category			0
at lunchtime today he will be named , alongside young @entity44 and @entity45 , in @entity47 ’s first @entity39 squad since they exited the @entity48 with only a point			0
without @entity38 and @entity50 , who confirmed his international retirement on tuesday , @entity28 will have the chance to make hay in the centre of @entity39 ’ s midfield			2
at 22 there is time to blossom , but club and country need him			0
in and out : the @entity22 midfielder has been criticised for his early season form so much was , rightly , made of the poolside party pictures from @entity62 just days after @entity39 ’s embarrassing exit from the @entity48 with a single point			1
on wednesday night , without the presence and influence of the suspended @entity68 in the centre , there was something of a swagger about @entity28 ’s game			1
it was n’t vintage , far from it , but he was instrumental in the goal that took @entity22 into the group stage after their annual dice with death in the qualifiers			2
at times he came alive , switching player with a swivel of his hips or a dip of his shoulder			0
there was the extravagant turn in the second half , spinning off @entity89 and @entity90 before driving forward at the start of another attack that lifted @entity22 ’s fans			2
deadlock : @entity94 ( centre ) celebrates putting @entity22 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity24 off the mark : @entity94 found the net in the 45th minute to open his account as an @entity22 player ‘ the burst is back when he get away from players , ’ admitted @entity31 and it would be hard to disagree			1
when he does that , he can compete with anyone			0
his quick - witted one - two with @entity106 for @entity22 ’s goal , the one that guarantees a 17th successive year of @entity6 football , drew gasps of admiration form the @entity23 crowd			1
mostly they were for @entity94 after he scored his first goal in an @entity22 shirt , but @entity28 played a significant role in it			1
there are times , especially when @entity68 is missing from the team through suspension , that the stage is set for @entity28 to dazzle			0
@entity123 - willing , @entity28 will go on to fulfil his potential			2
no - one doubts that he has the touches to be one of the main thrusts in this @entity22 team when they have the ball			2
setback : last season 's injuries halted @entity45 's ( centre ) development when they are without it , his game suffers			0
he knows that he brought down @entity24 winger @entity90 inside the area before @entity22 ’s opening goal			1
it should have been a penalty , fairly straightforward for referee @entity142 really , but somehow he ignored the claims from @entity24 ’ players			0
‘ i probably touched him , but it was a slip , ’ admitted @entity28			0
on wednesday night , the @entity22 midfielder landed on his feet			1
honesty : @entity31 himself has claimed that it is now or never for @entity28 @entity151 showed fighting spirit - @entity31			1

@entity28 *helped* engineer @entity22 's 1 - 0 win against @entity24 on wednesday
the @entity22 midfielder will be itching to compete against the best in the @entity6 group stages
@entity31 has claimed @entity28 must prove his worth this season
@entity28 has been criticised for his early season *performances*
