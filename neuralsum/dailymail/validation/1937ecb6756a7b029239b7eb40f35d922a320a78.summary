‘ to be going for the career grand slam and at such a young age as well , if that was me in his shoes i would consider myself under a lot of pressure because who would not want to complete that ? i think the key for @entity3 will be to try to look at it from an achievement standpoint rather than a pressure situation – that he ’s there because of the amazing feat of winning three of the four majors at aged 25			1
