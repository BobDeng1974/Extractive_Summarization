teachers have been encouraged to introduce pornography into the classroom , using sex education lessons to explain that porn is ' not all bad ' and ' hugely diverse '			1
the recommendations , included in an educational guide , suggest that teachers confront ' myths ' about porn and inform children as young as five about sexualisation			1
the guidance could have significant influence in @entity15 schools after the government 's decision to keep sex education lessons voluntary , leaving schools to devise their own ways of teaching the subject			1
guidance from the @entity23 , whose members include the @entity26 and @entity27 's , encourages teachers to introduce pornography into the classroom the @entity31 has led a long - running campaign to introduce measures to protect young people from the growing influence of porn			1
but the guidance , produced by a coalition of charities , encourages dialogue in the classroom about all aspects of pornography			1
issued by the @entity23 , whose members include the @entity26 and @entity27 's , the guidance encourages teachers to inform children over the age of 11 about subjects such as sexting , whereby sexually explicit images and pictures are sent in text messages			1
critics said that parents would be ' horrified ' by the possible introduction of pornography into classroom lessons			2
under a section titled ' we want teachers to know ' , the guide includes advice that ' that porn is hugely diverse â€“ it 's not necessarily all bad '			1
the ' wish list ' section , which aims to create the ' ideal environment ' for teaching about sexual issues , also advises teachers to ' speak frankly and confidently ' about pornography			1
in a model lesson plan , it is suggested that children are told about the differences between what is ' real ' and ' unreal ' in pornography , using a device known as the ' planet porn game '			2
the @entity31 has led a long - running campaign to introduce measures to protect young people from the growing influence of porn the guidance , contained within the body 's first @entity84 titled @entity86 , also suggests that teachers use a website that describes porn as ' great ' and something that can be enjoyed			1
a statement on @entity92 reads : ' sex is great			2
and porn can be great			2
it 's the idea that porn sex is like real sex which is the problem			2
' but if you can separate the fantasy from the reality you 're much more likely to enjoy both			0
' younger children should be taught about ' image manipulation in advertising and body image ' , according to the guide			0
the @entity108 's @entity107 criticised the guide , saying : ' the intention appears to be to steer children and young people away from a belief in moral absolutes and to encourage them to think that there are no rights and wrongs when it comes to sexual expression			0
' he told the @entity120 : ' many parents will be horrified at the prospect of their children being taught about pornography within such a framework			0
' to take a no - holds barred approach to sex education has the potential to break down pupils ' natural sense of reserve and to encourage casual attitudes towards sex			0
' ' if we want children to view sexual intimacy as something valuable , special and worthy of respect , it needs to be addressed with modesty and restraint			0
to give lessons on pornography is to play with fire			0
' the government announced in march that sex education would remain voluntary under the @entity147 after the previous @entity149 administration tried to make the lessons compulsory			0
the @entity31 has been calling for tough restrictions to protect youngsters			0
@entity152 has promised that new computers will be automatically be fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them - but has not said when this will happen .			0
