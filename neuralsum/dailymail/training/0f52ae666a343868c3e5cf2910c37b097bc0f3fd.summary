' we hope that this trial and the conclusions that are reached serve as an example to others in the industry			0

right , mr @entity7 , whose home the stonemason 's mate was renovating he was struck by the limestone slab and pinned to a set of stairs for five to 20 seconds after it toppled from its lintel as it was being lifted into place by a crane on february 9 , 2010			1

mansion : the court heard that @entity113 had committed a gross breach in its duty of care in its management and organisation of the work on mr @entity7 's 1,200 - acre @entity120 ( pictured ) ' honest ' : mr @entity0 's family have spoken of their relative 's ' profoundly honest ' nature and ' infectious laugh ' @entity126 , prosecuting , told the jury : ' the decision had been taken not to use any fixings to hold the stone in place , therefore when the strops [ a short rope whose ends are spliced together to make a ring ] on the crane were slackened off , the only thing that held it there was its own weight			1
' since it was top - heavy and its width was not uniform and it was balanced on two concrete blocks , it was inevitable it would topple			0
' he said tests on the block had found that because of its irregular shape , only a matter of millimetres which could decide whether it was stable or not			0
' the specialist inspectors from @entity155 considered the absence of restraint as being very serious , ' he said			0
sign : @entity113 is due to be sentenced at @entity30 on a forthcoming date ' they identified fixing the stones in place before the strops were let off was an essential part of the operation and absence was a significant error			1
' it was concluded this was a result of a complete lack of planning and the work of @entity113 fell significantly below the standard expected of someone carrying out such a lifting operation			2
' mr @entity126 added : ' it would appear no real thought or planning had gone into the operation itself			0
' @entity75 did almost nothing to ensure the lifting operation was done safely			0
the dangers it posed were obvious and they had been alerted by an email from the architect			0
