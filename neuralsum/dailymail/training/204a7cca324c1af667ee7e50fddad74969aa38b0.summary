it is probably the most overused word of 2014 but do n't write it off just yet because the photographic phenomenon is doing really great things			0
first , women across the country wiped off their make - up for the # barefaceselfie and raised money for cancer and now a new craze is sweeping the net which sees people kicking off their shoes for charity and posting a # barefootselfie			1

in a bid to raise awareness of the problem , shoe aid want to see snaps of your bare feet using the hashtag barefootselfie			1
a new hashtag on @entity36 is encouraging people to post barefoot selfies in order to raise awareness of those who have to go without footwear the movement is gathering considerable pace and has already seen several celebrities jump on board to help support the cause			1
@entity52 actor , @entity49 and @entity50 star @entity48 shared their barefoot selfies in water where as journalists , @entity56 and @entity57 chose to display their polished piggies for the campaign			0
