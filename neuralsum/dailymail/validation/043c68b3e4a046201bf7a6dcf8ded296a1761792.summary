@entity1 manager @entity0 has had his players training at @entity3 in the hope of exploiting a set - piece advantage over @entity6 in saturday 's lunchtime kick - off			1
@entity1 ’s home form this season is the second worst in the @entity10 , with bottom - side @entity11 the only club worse than them on home turf			0
the @entity3 pitch has been re-laid twice this season , and with @entity0 admitting the surface ‘ is n’t perfect ’ , he has called his players into the stadium that they face @entity6 in on saturday to practice their dead - ball routines			1
@entity0 admits @entity1 have been training at @entity3 ahead of their match against @entity6 since taking over at @entity1 , @entity0 has helped take the south @entity23 club up the @entity10 ‘ our home form is something that we ’re focusing on , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ really , we ’ve done enough to stay in the division away from home already but our home form does n’t reflect what it should be			0
‘ our stadium needs to be rocking tomorrow and if we want to keep it where it is in terms of that support , you ’ve got to give them wins			0
‘ we ’re a good set - play team so we ’ve been getting used to the co-ordinates here and the environment to make sure our set - plays are on the money tomorrow			1
@entity6 will be desperate for points at @entity3 on saturday lunchtime , after seven defeats in their last eight @entity46 has endured a difficult start to life in the managerial hot - seat at @entity50 ‘ this new pitch is good , but it ’s not perfect			1
the @entity10 pitches do n’t really get relaid during the season , they ’re perfect , so it ’s very unusual for us to have to do that			0
i ca n’t say it ’s as good as @entity58 ’s , @entity59 ’s or @entity60 ’s , because it is n’t			0
’ and @entity0 sees @entity1 ’s game against @entity6 as being more important for the visitors than his side , even though he admits both are still in a relegation scrap			1
‘ it ’s an important game , ’ he said			0
‘ probably more important for @entity6 than us , with where they are , those three teams down the bottom ( @entity6 , @entity70 and @entity11 ) really need a quick win to get them in touch again so it ’s a huge game for them – probably must - win			2
@entity1 's away form has been impressive , but @entity0 admits they need to improve their fortunes at home the @entity3 pitch has been relaid twice this season , and is not as impressive as other top flight clubs ‘ for us , we just need to make sure we pick up points or pick up wins when we can and we ’ll be ok			2
we have a cushion at the moment but it can be easily eroded with a defeat tomorrow so we need to make sure that we ’re on our metal			0
’ @entity1 , with 30 points , are currently eight points clear of third - bottom @entity6 but @entity0 still believes it will require a further 10 before his side are sure of staying up .			2
