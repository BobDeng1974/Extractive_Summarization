@entity0 reached the @entity2 semi-finals with a thrilling 25 - 21 victory over @entity4			1
tries from wing @entity6 , replacement @entity8 , a penalty try plus penalties from @entity12 and @entity13 and two @entity15 conversions brought the @entity0 back from a big deficit to victory			1
scrum - half @entity18 , fly - half @entity20 and number eight @entity22 crossed for the @entity4 , while @entity20 added three conversions			1
@entity0 replacement @entity8 powers over for try against @entity28 at @entity29 the draw could not have set - up a more mouth - watering @entity32 clash than this encounter between the old rivals , with an away trip to either @entity37 or @entity38 the reward for the victors			1
@entity28 held the upper hand historically , having won the @entity42 in 2010 when beating @entity44 outfit @entity43 28 - 21 , while the furthest the @entity0 had gone in @entity46 's second tournament was the semi-final stage			2
the @entity4 fielded a lot of their big guns , including @entity51 captain @entity50 , while the home region curiously left star @entity56 number eight @entity54 on the bench			1
the visitors came out of the blocks with a blast , forcing the @entity0 onto the defensive over their own line			0
from the attacking scrum five , the ball found its way to @entity18 to cross by the post and make @entity20 's conversion easy			2
@entity4 scrum half @entity18 crashes over for a @entity4 try in the first half @entity12 reduced the arrears when landing a long - range penalty but the @entity0 suffered the loss of international ace @entity73 with a bad leg injury , bringing @entity54 into the fray to the loud cheers of the crowd			1
it was a real cut and thrust affair but the @entity4 played with far more cohesion and they came up trumps again when , again from a scrum five , the ball went to @entity20 who drove through weak tackling to the line and again converted			0
the @entity0 did themselves no favours with an average kicking game as the @entity4 found the spaces and pushed them back			0
the @entity0 sqaud are overjoyed after they were awarded a penalty try but the home side pulled themselves back to within four points of the @entity4 at half - time when @entity6 was put away by scrum - half @entity94 under the posts , with @entity12 converting			1
a thorn in the @entity0 side was opposition wing @entity99 , who forced the home defence into multiple tackles - including one from full - back @entity103 , whose thumping hit prevented a possible runaway touchdown			0
the @entity0 took it to the @entity4 after the break as an attacking line - out set up a series of thrusts to the visiting line before @entity8 saw a gap and went over just seconds after coming on for flanker @entity114			2
@entity28 players @entity50 ( left ) , @entity116 ( cebtre ) and @entity117 walk off the pitch at full - time @entity12 's conversion hit the post but the home side were on top and went in front for the first time when a clearance attempt a few metres from his line by @entity18 was charged down and , as it crossed the line , a try was infringed			2
referee @entity132 had no hesitation in running under the posts for a penalty try , easily converted by @entity12 - with @entity18 earning 10 minutes in the bin			0
a penalty from @entity13 further increased the @entity0 ' lead - but the vsitors would not give up			0
from a series of scrums on the home line , @entity140 picked up and went by the posts with @entity20 's conversion reducing the deficit to four points			0
however , the @entity0 survived an onslaught in the dying minutes to hold on for the victory .			0

@entity0 scored tries through @entity6 and @entity8 along with a penalty try
@entity28 replied with scores from @entity18 , @entity20 and number eight @entity22
@entity51 captain @entity50 was in *action* for the @entity4
