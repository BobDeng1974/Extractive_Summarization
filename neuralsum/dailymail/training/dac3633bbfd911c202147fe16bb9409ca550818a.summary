by @entity0 last updated at 2:11 pm on 27th january 2012 a young mother is lucky to be alive after the sore arm doctors diagnosed as tennis elbow was in fact a deadly flesh eating bug			1
@entity7 , 32 , thought she 'd suffered a bad reaction to an insect bite after she spotted a tiny pus - filled boil on her left elbow			1
but when it refused to heal she went to the @entity15 department at @entity16 in @entity17 and was diagnosed as having tennis elbow			0
lucky to be alive : @entity7 , 32 , was left in a coma after contracting the killer condition necrotising fasciitis the mother - of - one , who had just returned from @entity23 in the @entity24 , was discharged from hospital after medics put her arm in a sling and told her to take paracetamol			1
but within 48 hours @entity7 was in a coma on life support after contracting the killer condition , necrotising fasciitis , a bacterial infection that destroys skin and the fat and the tissue covering the muscles			1
doctors compared the chances of @entity7 contracting the rare bug as the same as being hit by lightning in her lifetime - 10,000 to one			1
the bug , which kills three quarters of its victims , had ravaged @entity7 's arm and doctors were forced to spend four days cutting away at her flesh to stop it spreading elsewhere			1
but after the emergency treatment @entity7 has made an incredible recovery			1
@entity7 has now undergone a series of skin graphs with skin has been taken from her left leg to fill in the missing flesh from her arm @entity7 , from @entity17 , said : ' the doctors told me they had never seen anyone as ill as me who had survived			1
they said i was the sickest person in the hospital			0
i 'm lucky to be alive			0
' @entity7 , a full time mother to ten - year - old @entity60 , told how she started hallucinating soon after being discharged from the hospital			1
she said : ' i 'd been taking paracetamol and co-codamol but nothing touched the pain			0
' i was delirious and felt really sleepy so my mother called an ambulance			0
' when the paramedics arrived , they said my blood pressure was so low i was going to slip into a coma			0
' my heart rate was double what it should be and they said i was going to have a cardiac arrest			0
' when i got to hospital , they were sticking needles in my neck , my feet , all over			0
' they could n't get a line in because my veins kept collapsing			0
' @entity7 was then moved to a high dependency unit where she was put in an induced coma on life support while doctors tried to work out her mystery condition			1
she said : ' i 'd just come back from @entity23 so they thought it might be malaria but the symptoms were n't right			0
" doctors discovered she had necrotising fasciitis , often referred to as the ' flesh - eating bug ' because the bacteria spreads through the soft tissue , releasing toxins that destroy the tissues as it spreads			1
she was in a coma for a week , while surgeons cut away the infection , before she was well enough to be woken up			2
@entity7 was then transferred to the @entity103 in @entity17 for extensive skin grafts where skin from her left leg was used to ' fill in ' the missing flesh on her arm			1
@entity7 , who has needed intense physiotherapy to regain movement in her arm , said : ' i am self conscious about my scars			1
i do n't like wearing short skirts and i wo n't go out unless i 'm wearing a long sleeved top			0
' there have been times when i cried but i do n't sit there crying every night			0
i 've learnt to adapt			0
i just get on with it			0
' i 've got my arm and i 'm still here			0
the doctors said it 's like being struck by lightning			1
the chances of getting a flesh eating bug are that slim			1
' it 's been a real life lesson			0
you never know what 's around the corner			0
i 've learnt to appreciate things			0
' dr @entity130 , consultant in infection and tropical diseases at @entity133 , said : ' successful treatment relies on immediate recognition of the diagnosis and emergency surgery to remove all infected soft tissue			1
' it is true to say that without the ' proper ' surgery @entity7 would have inevitably died			2
' at @entity16 , the infectious diseases clinicians , emergency surgeons and the critical care teams worked together and fortunately @entity7 survived and her arm was saved			2
' we are all delighted that @entity7 has now successfully recovered			2
' necrotising fasciitis is a bacterial infection that destroys the skin and tissue covering muscle			1
it is pronounced : ' neck - row - tise - ing fas - e - i - tis '			2
sufferers contract the condition when the bacteria enters the body through an opening such as a cut , graze , or even a pin prick			2
the symptoms within 24 hours include pain in the area or limb where the bacteria first entered the body , as well as diarrhea , nausea , fever , confusion , dizziness , weakness , and intense first			2
within the next three days , the infected area will swell and blisters fill with blackish fluid may appear			0
after five days , the condition becomes critical as victims ' blood pressure drops severely and the body begins to go into toxic shock			2
more than 70 per cent of all infected victims die from the infection and a further 20 per cent of survivors need to have a limb amputated to stop the spread of the bacteria to the rest of the body			1
but necrotising faciitis is still very rare with only 500 to 15000 cases reported each year .			2

necrotising fasciitis is often referred to as the ' flesh - eating bug ' as it destroys skin tissue as it spreads
the rare infection kills three quarters of its victims while 20 per cent need limb amputation
the chances of @entity7 contracting the killer bacteria are the same as being struck by lightning - 10,000 to one
