the plague ravaged populations of early humans in @entity10 , until just 5 - 10,000 were left			1
but from that small population , humans emerged - and triumphed over other evolutionary cousins such as @entity14			2
neanderthal man : the key factor which separated man from our evolutionary rivals 100,000 years ago may not have been language - but instead a mysterious plague the bug attacked small infants and newborns , causing symptoms similar to sepsis or meningitis			1
but suriving it seems to have conveyed a key advantage			0
soon afterwards , homo sapiens expanded dramatically in numbers , and spread all over the @entity30			1
researchers found that human populations today have ' dropped ' two genes which related primates - apes - have , which could have left early man vulnerable to infections			1
the infections are related to modern bugs such as @entity38			1
‘ the modern bugs can still bind and could potentially have altered immune reactions , ’ said @entity39 , @entity40 , professor of medicine at @entity42 ' though it is impossible to discern exactly what happened during evolution , the investigators studied molecular signatures surrounding these genes to hypothesize that predecessors of modern humans grappled with a massive pathogenic menace between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago			2
e coli : ¿ the modern bugs can still bind and could potentially have altered immune reactions , @entity55 said @entity39 , @entity40 , professor of medicine at @entity42 ' this presumed ‘ selective sweep ’ would have devastated their numbers			1
only individuals with certain gene mutations survived – the tiny , emergent population of anatomically modern humans that would result in everyone alive today possessing a non-functional @entity67 - 17 gene and a missing @entity67 - 13 gene			1
' it 's widely known that 100,000 years ago , human evolution reached a mysterious bottleneck			2
the cause of the bottleneck remains unsolved , with proposed answers ranging from gene mutations to cultural developments like language to climate - altering events , among them a massive volcanic eruption			2
‘ in a small , restricted population , a single mutation can have a big effect , ’ said senior author			0
‘ we 've found two genes that are non-functional in humans , but not in related primates , which could have been targets for bacterial pathogens particularly lethal to newborns and infants			2
' killing the very young can have a major impact upon reproductive fitness			0
@entity94 survival can then depend upon either resisting the pathogen or on eliminating the target proteins it uses to gain the upper hand			0
’ ‘ genome sequencing can provide powerful insights into how organisms evolve , including humans , ’ said co-author @entity99 , @entity40 , phd , director of the @entity100 at the @entity101			0
the scientists ‘ resurrected ’ these ‘ molecular fossils ’ and found that the proteins were recognized by current pathogenic strains of @entity38 and @entity110			0
‘ the modern bugs can still bind and could potentially have altered immune reactions , ’ @entity39 said			0
‘ speciation ( the process of evolving new species from existing ones ) is driven by many things , ’ he said			0
‘ we think infectious agents are one of them			0

mysterious plague reduced human numbers to just *5,000* - 10,000
plague related to modern infections
man ' *bounced* back ' - and then spread from @entity10 all over the world
