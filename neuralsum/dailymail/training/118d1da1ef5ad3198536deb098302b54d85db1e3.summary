by @entity0 last updated at 10:41 am on 19th september 2011 an increase in child abuse , mostly in infants , is linked with the recent recession in new research that raises fresh concerns about the impact of the nation 's economic woes			1
the results are in a study of 422 abused children from mostly lower - income families , known to face greater risks for being abused , and the research involved just 74 counties in four states			1
but lead author dr @entity17 of @entity18 said the results confirm anecdotal reports from many paediatricians who 've seen increasing numbers of shaken baby cases and other forms of brain - injuring abuse			0
study : an increase in child abuse is linked with the recession in new research that raises fresh concerns about the impact of the nation 's economic woes dr @entity17 decided to study this type of injury , known as abusive head trauma , after noticing an increase at her own hospital from late 2007 through june 2009			1
her hospital averaged 30 cases per year during those recession years versus 17 yearly before 2007			1
author : dr @entity17 of @entity18 though this abuse is still uncommon , the number of cases in the counties studied increased sharply , rising from about 9 cases per 100,000 children in pre-recession years , to almost 15 per 100,000 kids during the recession — a 65 per cent increase			1
by contrast , juvenile diabetes — a better - known condition — affects about 19 per 100,000 children younger than age 10			0
children studied were younger than five , and most were infants			0
most suffered brain damage and 69 died , though the death rate did n't rise during the recession			2
unemployment rates in the 74 counties rose during the five - year study			2
the proportion of children on @entity65 in those counties also increased , from 77 per cent before the recession to 83 per cent			2
however , insurance and family employment information were not reported for the abused children in the study			2
combine the stress of raising a young child with wage cuts or lost jobs and you get ' a sort of toxic brew in terms of thinking about possible physical violence ' , said @entity81 , a social welfare professor at @entity82 in @entity83			1
he said the study echoes sociological research linking violence with declines in economic well - being			1
along with @entity92 @entity91 data released last week indicating that a record 46 million @entity92 are poor , the study shows that ' as poverty goes up and economic stagnation continues ... there are really human costs involved ' , @entity81 said			1
the study was released online monday in @entity98			2
results : children studied were younger than five , and most were infants			0
most suffered brain damage and 69 died the counties studied included @entity104 and western @entity105 , central and southern @entity106 and a handful of counties in northern @entity109 and in the @entity111 area			0
the researchers examined medical records and national labour statistics for 2004 through november 2007 and compared them with data from the recession			1
of the 422 children diagnosed with abusive head trauma during the study , roughly 65 cases occurred each year before the recession , versus about 108 yearly during the recession			1
blame : the country 's economic woes are thought to be the reason for the rise in child abuse federal government data suggest that the recession did not affect child abuse rates			2
but the study authors said those numbers are based on reports from child protective services , not medical diagnoses , and did not address brain injuries specifically			1
the research does n't prove that the recession caused the abuse			2
studying different regions and children from more middle - class families would help clarify if the recession really played a role , said dr @entity145 , director of the residency program in social paediatrics at @entity148 in @entity149			0
dr @entity145 noted that most children studied were publicly insured even before the recession , suggesting that their families were already struggling financially			0
still , the recession affected many lower - income families , and dr @entity145 said the study highlights ' a very important issue '			1
many of his patients are from poor families and abuse is not uncommon , he said , but believes paediatricians could help with prevention by asking families about difficulties paying for food or shelter and referring those in need to social service agencies			0
sometimes just asking parents about stresses in their lives and acknowledging their struggles can help , he said			0
most parents who abuse young children are n't ' ill - intentioned ' , he said			0
' most of it is kind of just snapping ... maybe being sleep - deprived and just losing it			0
it 's something that can happen to anyone			0
@entity181 is just another stress ' that can increase the risks , dr @entity145 said .			0

head injuries almost *double* in @entity92 after credit *crunch*
study shows link between recession and violence
stress may cause parents to ' snap ' say researchers
