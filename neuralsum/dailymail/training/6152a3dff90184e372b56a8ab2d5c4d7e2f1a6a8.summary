researchers have claimed that @entity2 's portrayal of @entity3 as a psychopath was unfounded - but admit he was a control freak			1
a team at the @entity7 , which recently discovered the remains of the @entity3 under a car park , are now attempting to analyse the king 's personality			1
they found that , while there was no evidence for @entity2 ’s depiction of @entity3 as a psychopath , he may have had ' intolerance to uncertainty syndrome ' – which may have manifested in control freak tendencies			1
the hunchback king : the skeleton or @entity3 , unearthed in a dig last september , showing evidence of the curvature of the spine and battle injuries suffered by the last @entity29 king they say their analysis aims to humanise @entity3 and ' to flesh out the bones and get to the character of the man who became one of the most controversial kings in @entity38 history			1
' professor @entity39 , @entity41 ’s @entity40 , and forensic psychologist dr @entity42 carried out the study based on the consensus among historians			2
firstly , they examined one of the most persistent and critical depictions of @entity3 ’s personality – the suggestion that he was a murdering psychopath			1
@entity52 appears as @entity3 in @entity53 in @entity54			1
researchers now say @entity2 's portrayal of him was unfair ' this reputation , portrayed most famously in @entity2 ’s play , does not seem to have any basis in the facts we have about his life , ' they said			2
they found he showed little signs of the traits psychologists would use to identify psychopaths today – including narcissism , deviousness , callousness , recklessness and lack of empathy in close relationships			1
however , the academics speculate that @entity3 may have exhibited a common psychological syndrome know as an intolerance to uncertainty			1
professor @entity39 said : ' this syndrome is associated with a need to seek security following an insecure childhood , as @entity3 had			1
in varying degrees , it is associated with a number of positive aspects of personality including a strong sense of right and wrong , piety , loyalty to trusted colleagues , and a belief in legal processes - all exhibited by @entity3			1
' on the negative side it is also associated with fatalism , a tendency to disproportionate responses when loyalty is betrayed and a general sense of ' control freakery ' that can , in extreme cases , emerge as very authoritarian or possibly priggish			1
' we believe this is an interesting perspective on @entity3 's character			1
' in addition , the pair examined how his disability , evident in the curvature of the spine of the @entity3 ’s remains may have had an impact on his character - and specifically on the way he interacted with people who he did not know well			1
the remains of @entity3 came within a matter of inches of being lost forever when a 19th century toilet was built above the skeleton , a lead archaeologist revealed today			1
@entity124 , who led the project to exhume the deposed king , said his final resting place came close to being ' completely destroyed ' when the outhouse was built on top of the site			2
luckily , the grave was only slightly disturbed by the building 's primitive foundations , which missed the deceased monarch 's body by a few inches when they were installed			2
because his remains were buried just 27in under the flag stones of @entity141 in @entity142 , they were disturbed on a number of occasions as by builders developing the area			0
the 527 - year - old skeleton - buried with its hands crossed in a shallow grave - was missing its feet , which experts believe were smashed off when the foundations were built			0
the site was later turned into a council car park for social workers until a team searching for the king 's body excavated the area last september			0
a three - week dig by experts from the @entity7 unearthed the skeleton which was confirmed ' beyond reasonable doubt ' today to be that of the last @entity29 king			0
but mr @entity124 said that the king 's remains were almost flushed down the pan when the outhouse was constructed in the 1800s			0
he said : ' the remains were very vulnerable because they were only under relatively modern debris			0
a less experienced team could easily have damaged the skeleton whilst using a mechanical digger to open the trench			0
' one woman 's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of @entity3 screenwriter @entity180 , pictured right , said she felt a chill on a hot summer 's day as she walked through the area where it was thought he was buried			1
the remarkable discovery of the remains , which , consistent with historical accounts of @entity3 , have both a curved spine back and wounded skull , was made last september			2
miss @entity180 was strolling across the car park used by @entity142 social services while researching a play about the king when she felt a chill in august 2009			0
' it was a hot summer and i had goosebumps so badly and i was freezing cold			0
i walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew i was walking on his grave , ' she told the @entity202			0
' i am a rational human being but the feeling i got was the same feeling i have had before when a truth is given to me			0
' miss @entity180 initially funded the excavation of what is now a @entity209 car park because she was ' 99 per cent certain ' that the remains were those of @entity3			2
miss @entity180 , who is a member of the @entity212 , is working on a documentary charting the excavation for @entity215 titled @entity3 : @entity3 in the @entity216 , which has been made alongside the university academics and will be screened tonight			2
she said the her play has been turned into a script for television and film , which is now ' getting serious interest from @entity223 and in the @entity224 '			0
in medieval times , deformation was often taken as a visible indication of a twisted soul			0
as a result , it is possible that this would have made him cautious in all his interactions with others			0
professor @entity39 added : ' overall , we recognise the difficulty of drawing conclusions about people who lived 500 years ago and about whom relatively little is reliably recorded ; especially when psychology is a science that is so reliant upon observation			0
' however , noting that this is the problem historians work with as a matter of routine , we argue that a psychological approach provides a distinct and novel perspective : one which offers a different way of thinking about the human being behind the bones			0

psychologists claim @entity3 displayed signs of ' control freakery '
claim his *behaviour* was seen as ' as very authoritarian or possibly priggish '
