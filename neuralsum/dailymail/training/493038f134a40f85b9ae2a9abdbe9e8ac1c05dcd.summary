by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 24 may 2013 a real - life @entity3 suit has been developed that lets astronauts jump to @entity7 without a parachute - instead using rocket boots to soften the landing			1
the design of the @entity13 @entity12 is reminiscent of the suit used by @entity3 in the @entity3 films and also comes with hi - tech augmented reality goggles , power gloves , movement gyros and is made using a commercial space suit			1
it has been built as part of a joint project between @entity24 - based space firm @entity23 and biomedical design company , @entity25 who want to release a production model by 2016			1
teams from @entity23 and @entity25 in @entity24 have developed a suit that could be used for space diving			1
it has been designed to be fitted with ' rocket boots ' meaning the diver could jump from his spaceship in low @entity7 orbit and land without the need of a parachute			1
the designs are based on how @entity3 lands and flies in the @entity3 films and a production model could be available as soon as 2016 the real - life @entity3 suit			1
this yellow prototype has been developed by @entity24 - based @entity52 chief technology officer @entity51 , pictured			1
its made from a commercial space suit			1
it will be fitted with ' rocket boots ' and tested at altitude by july 2016 the @entity13 @entity12 would let people make high - altitude jumps from near - space , suborbital space , and eventually low @entity62 itself			1
@entity64 successfully completed a space dive from 127,852 feet above the @entity7 , in october last year			2
his free fall took 4 minutes and 19 seconds before he opened his parachute			0
the teams from @entity23 and @entity25 plan to carry out flight tests of the @entity12 in a similar way to how @entity64 's completed his dive , to see how the suit survives the fall			2
they then plan to use modern ' wing suit ' skydiving technology with small aerospike engines attached to the suit boots that will let the diver glide , move and land using just propulsion engines on his feet			2
the ar goggles made by @entity25 work in a similar way to @entity85			0
they are designed to give the diver information about altitude , elevation , acceleration rates , location - using gps and @entity92 radar information - and trajectory data during the jump			2
designs showing what the ' rocket boots on the @entity98 could look like '			1
they will be fitted with small aerospike propulsion engines that will let the diver glide , move and land on his feet without the need for a parachute in a video produced by @entity23 and @entity25 , the teams demonstrate how their space diving suit would look			2
the space diving video shows an astronaut jumping from a spaceship and flying to @entity7 before landing using rocket boots it can also tell the diver if there are any malfunctions that could stop the boots from helping him land , in which case he could switch to using the parachute			1
they can also respond to voice commands by filtering out other noise such as wind , air and engine sounds			0
the goggles will not have the video mode seen in @entity85 though , and instead will use ' @entity132 - through ' technology that is similar to the @entity134 seen on modern fighter jets			2
this view places the information over the pilot 's view , instead of obstructing it			0
as the diver reaches @entity7 , the mini aerospike thrusters in the rocket boots will kick in			1
the ' @entity3 ' suit will be fitted with hi - tech augmented reality goggles designed by @entity25			1
they can give the diver information about altitude , elevation , acceleration rates , location - using gps and @entity92 radar information - and trajectory data during the jump			0
it can also show temperatures , heart rates , and warn the diver if there are any malfunctions that could stop him landing safely @entity23 is hoping there will be two different landing methods and plan to test both			0
the first will be ' a feet - down ' method with the aerospikes kicking in from an altitude of about hundred feet			0
the second , and more similar to how @entity3 lands in @entity3 , will see the diver use ' wing suit flare up ' to slow him down			0
the suit could be similar to the @entity3 suit worn in the hit series of films - and will even have a similar head - up display the @entity3 suit as seen in the film series - which also has rocket boosters and allows @entity3 to fly the diver will then swoop within ten feet of the ground before pulling upright and lighting the thrusters			2
the first live tests will be used during traditional parachute jumps			0
@entity23 plans to then fully test these landing methods at altitude by july 2016			1
it is then hoping to launching a production model of the @entity13 @entity12 later that year			1
the aerospike engine is a type of rocket engine that can be used at different altitudes			0
it produces thrust that can be used to propel a person or vehicle forward or upwards			0
they are similar to the larger engines used to launch space shuttles and because they use traditionally 25 to 35 % less fuel than other types of rocket engines , were initially tested for the @entity202			0
the term aerospike is used for a truncated plug nozzle with a conical taper and some gas injection that formed an ' air spike '			0
the basic concept of any engine bell is to move the flow of exhaust gases from the rocket engine in one direction , causing thrust and propulsion			0
instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell , an aerospike engine fires along the outside edge the ' spike '			0

commercial space suit will be fitted with rocket boots , augmented reality goggles , power gloves and movement gyros
@entity24 - based designers plan to test the suit at altitude by july 2016 before released a production model later that year
