locked in a tiny cage in a @entity2 dog pound , underfed , his great muscles wasting away , @entity5 the @entity6 seemed destined for an unhappy ending			1
but 3,000 miles away in @entity9 , a barmaid had other ideas			0
@entity11 , 21 , launched a rescue effort befitting @entity5 ’s courageous breed after seeing a photograph of him posted on @entity15 by an animal charity			1
tragic : @entity5 's plight started after he escaped from his home in @entity2 and was picked up and then trapped by a dog warden at this pound convinced she had to save him but without the money to do so , she raised £ 1,000 for his medical treatment and flight to the @entity25 , persuaded the animal charity on the island to help her – and eventually succeeded with the help of the local mayor			1
@entity5 , now two , is believed to have been picked up by a dog warden and put in a pound in the @entity2 capital @entity33 after escaping from his home			1
desperate and hungry , @entity5 was shut up in a 10ft by 3ft cage for eight months after fighting with other dogs			2
the dog weighed just 49kg - when a healthy @entity6 should weigh 70kg - and because he was n’t exercised he had severe muscle wastage meaning he could n’t even sit down			1
at first the manager of the pound refused to give @entity5 up for adoption			2
but after a long battle , he was released on the mayor ’s orders			0
the charity nursed him back to health , and two weeks ago he arrived at @entity47 to be met by his new owner – miss @entity11			2
caged : this was the 3 x 1 metre cage @entity5 was kept in while at the @entity33 pound in @entity2			1
he weighed just 49kg - when a healthy @entity6 should weigh 70kg - and due to severe muscle wastage he could n't even sit down			1
new life : @entity5 's new life in @entity9 with owner @entity11 , 21 , is a world apart from his old one where he spent eight months in a cage in @entity33 she said : ' it cost all that money for flights , food , vet fees and his crate but it was worth every penny			1
' it only took just over two months from when i first saw him to organise everything and get him over to the @entity25			0
after a three - month campaign , she finally met the dog she had worked so hard to rescue two weeks ago at @entity47 , and says it ’s the best money she ’s ever spent			0
' as far as i can make out , he escaped from home and was picked up and then trapped by a dog warden at this pound			0
' she said : ‘ my mum has @entity77 so i ’m used to their size			0
@entity5 ’s been eating really well and he ’s getting to where he should be			2
’ during his early weeks at the pound , @entity5 showed signs of aggression and fought with other dogs - and so was moved into a small cage - his home for eight months			2
@entity15 : ms @entity11 found @entity5 here on the @entity2 @entity89 ( @entity90 ) at which point her campaign to rescue him started friends for life : after a three - month campaign to adopt @entity5 and free him from his life of misery , ms @entity11 finally met him at @entity47 and he has n't left her side since but his aggression was only because he was hungry and was trying to get food from other dogs			1
@entity11 says the pound kept @entity5 isolated and malnourished , but volunteers tried to give him extra food and monitor his welfare			1
his chances of escape were thwarted because the manager of the pound wanted to keep @entity5 as a guard dog , so all offers to adopt him were rejected			2
but his plight was noticed by the @entity2 @entity89 who started to lobby for his freedom , which is when @entity11 noticed him			1
she said : “ i started my campaign for his freedom in early july submitting formal offers of adoption , all of which were ignored			0
i made contact with a woman from a cat and dog sanctuary in @entity2			0
hand - in - hand : ms @entity11 said she was overcome with emotion after seeing @entity5 in his cramped and cruel conditions in the @entity2 pound and just had to get him to the @entity25 home at last : ms @entity11 raised over a £ 1,000 to fly @entity5 away from his nightmarish ordeal in @entity2 and says it is the best money she has ever spent he tested positive for @entity133 - a bacteria transmitted by ticks - and was started on his treatment , before being micro-chipped , lead trained and taken out to get used to crowds and noises before being flown to the @entity25			1
@entity11 said : ' it was so strange when i met him at the airport			0
i was n’t sure what his behaviour or temperament would be like			0
' but i ’m so lucky , because he ’s the best dog i ’ve ever met			0
' he loves people , and i was worried he would be afraid of them			0
' he ’s loving and happy , and he just wants to impress people			0
he can push the boundaries a bit but you can tell someone ’s hit him before because he does cower sometimes			0
' @entity11 , who lives with her boyfriend , 24 - year - old steel worker @entity153 , said she was now hoping to build @entity5 into the big strong dog he should be			1
campaign : ms @entity11 started her campaign for his freedom in early july submitting formal offers of adoption , all of which were initially ignored determined : ms @entity11 continued to appeal for @entity5 's release and adoption , and with the help of the local @entity166 mayor , won the right to have him sent to the @entity25 a dog 's life : ' when i met him at the airport i was n't sure what his temperament would be like			1
but i 'm so lucky , because he 's the best dog i 've ever met			0
he 's so friendly ' , said proud ms @entity11			2

@entity11 , 21 , saw @entity5 on a @entity2 animal charity 's @entity15 page and campaigned to have him adopted
he was severely malnourished and due to muscle wastage could n’t even sit down
she raised more than £ 1,000 to fly him away from his nightmarish ordeal
