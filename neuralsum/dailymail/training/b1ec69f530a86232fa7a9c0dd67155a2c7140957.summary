the @entity92 have already settled privately with the @entity246 , a bar in @entity111 where @entity3 had been drinking in february 2010			1

@entity257 , a fellow of the @entity258 , has been practicing adoption law for nearly 30 years			0
she told @entity260 that while nothing illegal was done when @entity3 adopted his girlfriend , she ’s seen many cases where adoption ‘ is used for purposes other than what you ’d traditionally think it was intended			1
’ in @entity112 , adult adoptions do not have the same requirements as traditional child adoptions			0
she explained : ‘ a lot of the traditional adoption statutes - including home studies – those protections are eliminated when you ’re adopting an adult , with less government intrusion being the goal			0
’ she said the only people who have to consent in an adult adoption are the adoptee and the adopter			0
under @entity112 law , they do have to give notice of the adoption , though ms @entity257 notes that parental consent is not required			0
‘ the court may not have been aware of many things , ’ she said , ‘ including that there was a pending wrongful death suit , or that she was a girlfriend			2
’ when asked if is now legal for @entity3 to have sex with his daughter , ms @entity257 responded : ‘ that ’s a good question			2
i ’m not a criminal lawyer , but it ’s a solid question to wonder about			0
’ she said that because they ’re both adults and not biologically related , the question ’s answer is murky			0
‘ creepy , ’ she said , ’ but i do n’t know if that ’s illegal			0
’ attorney @entity303 told @entity260 that under @entity112 law , the statutory has no law against having sex with an adopted child as long as there is no lineal consanguinity - meaning there is no close blood tie , such as aunt , uncle , niece , or nephew			2
ms @entity257 said that should @entity3 wish to marry ms @entity16 after the criminal case , it would be a difficult endeavour			1
the statute , she said , is permanent in the eyes of the law			0
‘ even for fraud of duress , you have to bring the challenges in front of the court			0
’ in @entity112 , all adoption papers are sealed and can not be viewed by reporters or third parties			0
‘ a court could order the file open , ’ ms @entity257 said , ’ but it is difficult to do ’ – in most cases because of the sensitive nature of protecting identities			0
ms @entity16 could in theory , with the consent of @entity3 , be re-adopted by her parents and then marry him , ms @entity338 ’s civil case , ms @entity257 said the court could open the adoption file and examine if there was any fraud on the court or the adoptee ( ms @entity16 )			1
she added : ‘ there ’s nothing illegal , per se , about adopting your girlfriend			0
