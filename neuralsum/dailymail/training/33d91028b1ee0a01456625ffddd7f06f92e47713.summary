@entity1 general secretary @entity0 confirmed members had voted for industrial action but said the union remained open for talks tube drivers have voted to go on strike after one of their colleagues was sacked for allegedly being drunk on the job			1
members of the @entity13 union voted for the industrial action by 299 votes to 221 after the @entity17 driver lost his job			1
@entity19 , which has a ' zero tolerance ' policy on drugs and alcohol , had urged union members to vote against strikes , insisting they dismissed the driver for failing two random breath alcohol tests			1
but union bosses claimed the tests were ' unfair ' as they did n't take medical conditions into account which could affect the result			1
general secretary @entity0 said : ' our members have voted for industrial action and the union will now consult extensively with our representatives before deciding on our next moves in this dispute			2
' the union remains available for talks , at @entity42 if necessary , and as we have already stated we are ready to abide by any decision made at an @entity44 and can not understand @entity19 's reluctance to agree to that course of action			2
' @entity19 operations director @entity48 said the decision was a matter of safety and urged those who voted for strike action to ' see sense			1
' ' we operate a zero tolerance approach towards the consumption of alcohol in order to keep customers and staff safe , ' he added			0
' you would n't let someone who had been drinking alcohol drive your family in a car , and we do n't let people who have been drinking alcohol drive people 's families in tube trains			0
' as we have made clear , strike threats will not alter our commitment to safety , nor will they make us consider reinstating a driver who failed two alcohol breath tests			2
' @entity1 members have sent a clear message to their leadership that they do n't support indefensible strike action on this issue			2
' less than a quarter of those eligible to vote for strike action did so			0
' i urge the @entity1 leadership to see sense and recognise that there is simply no point in taking any further action			0
' @entity1 regional organiser @entity89 said he rejected a number of allegations by mr @entity48 , in a letter sent out to union members			0
he said : ' @entity1 fully supports the zero - tolerance policy and takes seriously our obligations to protect the safety of passengers and staff			0
if they go ahead , the tube strikes could cause chaos for commuters trying to get to work in @entity19 ' we are actually asking for further testing when a hand held breathalyser gives a positive result			1
' this makes the process more robust and also complies with the @entity110 in protecting members of staff with medical conditions			1
' the current system is unfair because it does n't offer safeguards to those with disabilities or who are on certain diets			0
' one of @entity19 's own doctors conceded that type 2 diabetes , liver disease and even fasting can give false positives on hand held machines			0
