by @entity0 a youth club gifted a @entity3 artwork has been offered £ 1million for their piece because it comes with a rare letter from the mystery artist			1
the painting , called @entity8 , had appeared overnight on a plank of wood screwed to a wall close to the @entity12 in @entity3 's home town of @entity14			1
the struggling club hoped that by selling the piece they would be able to remain open			1
however , the artwork was removed by the city council , who maintained they owned the wall , and put on display in @entity14			1
some art critics have said the man in the painting resembles former prime minister @entity51			0
' we have had big offers from as far away as @entity54 , ' he said			0
' but i am concerned about choosing an appropriate auctioneer and one which is respectful of the work			0
confirmation : the artist waded in to the row by writing a letter to @entity33 , who runs the club , giving him his ' blessing ' to do what he felt was right with the art ' i seen @entity3 be critical of some of these auctions for the types of his art they sell so you have to be sensitive			1
' for now it is in the gallery for everyone to see but we are hoping to pin down an auctioneer this week some time			0
' some of the offers we have had have been in excess of £ 1 million and the letter we have from @entity3 is also thought to be very rare			1
' it ’s all great news for the club and we hope to sell it for as much as possible to settle our finances and secure our future over the next few years at least			2
' the painting was first discovered at the club in @entity88 ’s , @entity14 , on april 15 after @entity3 posted a picture of the new design on his website			1
funding : mr @entity33 said the sale of the piece would safeguard the club ( pictured ) as well as help fund other youth projects in the area popular : a couple joke around next to the @entity3 artwork , painted onto a wooden board bolted to the wall the cash - strapped youth group , who needed to find £ 120,000 just to stay open after struggling due to the recession , insisted @entity3 wanted them to have it and planned to sell the work to fund the future of the club			1
they removed the artwork to protect it from vandals and put it on display inside the club			2
however , @entity114 said it was not ' 100 per cent sure of the ownership ' of the wall the artwork was attached to , and days later removed the piece with the support of police			1
it was put on display at @entity122 while its ownership was decided and more than 10,000 people viewed it over the @entity125 weekend alone			2
but on may 6 mr @entity33 received the letter from @entity3 , who gave the cash - strapped boys club permission to sell it			1
the following day the city 's mayor @entity129 received a similar letter from @entity3 confirming it was genuine			1
row : @entity114 said it was not ' 100 per cent sure of the ownership ' of the wall the artwork was attached to , and days later removed the piece with the support of police safe keeping : before the artwork was taken by the council , the club had removed it from the wall and positioned it inside to protect it from vandals the artist had written : ' i do n't normally admit to committing criminal damage but seeing as it looks like charges wo n't be brought anytime soon you have my blessing to do what you feel is right with the piece			1
' i 'm a great admirer of the work done at the club and would be chuffed if this can help in some way			0
' after confirming the origin of the letter , mr @entity129 tweeted : ' just received confirmation by # @entity3 that note to # @entity159 is authentic			2
great to have a clear resolution			0
' as far as i 'm concerned it [ the artwork ] now belongs to the club as i 'd agreed once confirmation received from @entity3			2
resemblance : some critics of the piece have suggested the man in the painting looks like former prime minister @entity51 ' i 've received confirmation by # @entity3 that note is authentic & ' @entity8 ' can go to the # @entity159 :-) ' it is thought the letter from the artist has helped significantly increase the value of the artwork which was initially estimated to be worth up to £ 400,000			1
mr @entity33 said the sale of the piece would safeguard the club , which has been running for more than 100 years - offering activities such as boxing and other sports , for future generations , as well as help fund other youth projects in the area			1
mr @entity129 said the painting was currently still on display at the museum , and that visitors who had come to view the artwork had raised £ 2,000 for the club			2
' this has been a wonderful @entity14 story and typical @entity3 mystery , ' he said			1
' i had agreed with @entity33 at the club , after they had removed it from the wall of the adjacent council depot , that it was best that we took care of the picture and displayed it to enable people to view it while we waited to hear @entity3 ’s intentions			1
in the meantime it has resulted in us raising over £ 2,000 in donations for the club			2
' i shall be delighted to hand over the picture to the @entity211 once we ’ve ticked all necessary boxes when it comes to the proper legal process			0
' we shall be planning the handover of the picture and assisting the club in any way we can in their ambition to raise maximum funds through its sale			0
in the meantime it will remain on display in @entity14			0
' @entity224 - based street artist @entity3 is known worldwide for his stencils which often carries political messages or questions about society			0
despite his worldwide fame and his artwork selling for thousands , his true identity remains a secret - leading to a network of myths surrounding him and it is rumoured that his own parents do n't know what he does , believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator			0
there is also the suggestion that @entity3 is actually a collective of artists and does n't exist at all			0
@entity3 's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism			0
however by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation			0
he has allegedly been photographed in the past but has always been wearing a mask or hood			0
in 2008 he was reportedly ' unmasked ' as @entity255 , a former public schoolboy from @entity14 with a passion for art. at the time @entity3 's agent refused to confirm or deny the story			1
@entity3 then wrote on his website : ' i am unable to comment on who may or may not be @entity3 , but anyone described as being ' good at drawing ' does n't sound like @entity3 to me			2
' fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film @entity266 - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated			0
his most famous artworks include @entity270 - a lover hanging out the window of his mistress - and @entity274 , which he has created several versions of across @entity277 including @entity278 and the @entity279			0
@entity3 's top sellers include :			0
