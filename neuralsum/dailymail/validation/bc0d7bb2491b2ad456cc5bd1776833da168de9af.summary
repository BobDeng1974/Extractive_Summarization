@entity1 benchwarmer @entity0 sent a message to @entity3 with two clinical finishes for @entity5 in their friendly in @entity7 on thursday night			1
@entity0 struck twice in four minutes for @entity5 's second and third goals in a 6 - 0 thrashing of the world no 103 - ranked side at the @entity12			2
the 29 - year - old has been craving regular football having not started for his club since february 28 but delivered as he so often has for national team head coach @entity16			0
@entity0 celebrates the second of his two goals for @entity5 in their friendly against @entity7 out - of - favour @entity1 striker watches his first strike , a classy volley , hit the bottom corner 1 @entity25 24 goals in 68 games 2 @entity0 23 in 55 3 @entity27 20 in 57 4 @entity28 17 in 84 5 @entity29 15 in 66 6 @entity30 14 in 37 @entity31 14 in 37 8 @entity32 13 in 29 @entity33 13 in 54 10 @entity34 12 in 32 @entity35 12 in 49 first though , @entity0 was the provider for fellow striker @entity37 to open the scoring on 14 minutes after @entity40 's @entity39 hit the post early on			1
showing strength at the back post @entity0 headed back to @entity44 at the top of the six - yard box for the @entity48 marksman to drill home the finish			0
captain @entity0 then stepped up in the 32nd minute to get himself on the scoresheet with a clinical left - footed volley after a looping ball over the top of the flagging @entity7 defence			0
@entity0 's second came moments later , again with a first - time finish , but this time after his explosive run between defenders was met with a well - weighted through ball			2
the strike , which it must be said took a significant deflection , took @entity0 's international tally to 23 in 55 matches , just one short of his country 's all - time top - scorer @entity25 's 24 from 68			1
@entity37 drills home @entity5 's first goal after a strong header from @entity0 set him up @entity0 pierces through the hapless @entity7 defence on thursday night as he enjoys valuable game time defender @entity74 brings down @entity0 wide on the right during their friendly after the break @entity77 's @entity76 came on to add his second goal in as many international showings after a deft pass from @entity83 's @entity82 for 4 - 0			1
after @entity16 decided his star man had had enough after 72 minutes , @entity85 's @entity84 and @entity87 - based @entity86 came off the bench to continue his work with goals five and six respectively to wrap up the mismatch			2
despite his personal tally getting a boost , @entity0 made a point to commend his team 's effort after the match			2
' great victory today against @entity7 , ' he wrote on his @entity101 page			0
' the most important think , the amazing team work ! ! ! go @entity5			0
' @entity0 has scored just four times in 22 appearances since coming to @entity106 on loan from @entity108 and is almost certain to go elsewhere in the summer			0
@entity5 's @entity86 , who plays for @entity109 in @entity87 , beats @entity110 for the sixth @entity40 's @entity39 shoots in @entity5 's 6 - 0 win at the @entity12 in @entity113 @entity7 keeper @entity114 makes himself big as @entity0 comes close for a third @entity5 enjoy support away from home in @entity7 as they continue preparations for the @entity119 but with some sharp running and eagle eye for goal - at least twice - he showed glimpses of the reasons why the club thought him worthy of £ 260,000 - a - week for this season			1
he should have left the pitch with a hat - trick , to be fair , with a golden chance at the far post on 49 minutes squandered following a poor @entity7 clearance from a free - kick			0
@entity0 's last goal for @entity135 's side came on january 31 when he scored @entity1 's second in a 3 - 1 defeat of @entity138			1
his most recently involvement under @entity135 has been minimal - as an 83rd minute substitute in wins against @entity142 and @entity143 after being hooked after 68 minutes with @entity1 1 - 0 up against @entity144 - as the @entity145 puts his faith in @entity147 with support from @entity149 and @entity150 in the absence of @entity152			0
@entity5 's match in @entity113 served as a warm - up for the @entity119 in @entity155 from june 11 to july 4 at which they will be hoping to see the return of @entity158 's @entity34 who is still recovering foot injury .			1
