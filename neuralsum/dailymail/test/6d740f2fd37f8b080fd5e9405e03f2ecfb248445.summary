a few months ago @entity0 would have been happy with @entity2 survival			1
now they have a chance for so much more			0
in recent years @entity0 have struggled to compete but they are a proper club			1
when i left @entity7 for @entity0 it was because i felt they shared similar traits - tradition , history and both took pride of place in their communities			1
@entity0 were one of the founder members of the @entity18 and in the early years of the @entity20 , the trophy was almost theirs to keep			1
now this group has a chance to embrace that history and write the next chapter			1
@entity0 celebrate in the @entity26 dressing room after beating @entity27 to reach this year 's @entity20 final @entity29 joined @entity0 in 1986 and made the move because of the club 's rich history and tradition @entity34 has invigorated this side and you can feel that improvement in their performances			1
but for all the excitement @entity0 fans must be patient			2
talking about getting a club ‘ back where they belong ’ can be a dangerous game			0
@entity0 won the @entity46 in 1982 and while there ’s nothing wrong with being ambitious , fans have to be realistic			2
previous generations at @entity0 have seen success and can be too demanding			2
even when they were challenging for the @entity46 under @entity54 there were still rumblings of discontent			0
when things do start to go wrong , @entity57 can be an unforgiving place			0
i experienced that when i was relegated and it can be a difficult place to play			0
but what ground is n’t when things are going badly ? in the past @entity57 has been so loud players could hardly hear themselves think and the atmosphere the fans created at @entity26 was magnificent			0
now with @entity34 hopefully a generation can grow with his side			0
making the final is a fine achievement and @entity34 and his players will be desperate to become part of the fabric of a fantastic club			0
@entity0 celebrate winning the @entity46 after beating @entity77 in @entity78 33 years ago manager @entity34 has invigorated @entity0 and has considerably improved the side 's performances			1

@entity0 have a chance of @entity20 glory after reaching the final
a few months ago the @entity87 club only had survival to contend with
the @entity0 *squad* can write the next chapter in the club 's history
