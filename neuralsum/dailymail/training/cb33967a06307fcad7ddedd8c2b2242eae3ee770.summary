between them is the story of the development of the submarine			0
they were very small and were expensive to develop			0
past and future : @entity195 in the front , @entity22 in the distance and between them three submarines historic : the dock at @entity59 with a royal sovereign class ship on the left and @entity22 to starboard ‘ they did n’t even have proper names because they were n’t considered important enough			0
