she says her weight gain made her feel suicidal in the programme , viewers follow @entity22 star @entity21 ’s well - documented battle with yo - yo diets , meet 59 - year - old @entity40 whose weight has fluctuated for most of her life and @entity43 , who has accepted the only way she will ever be thin is to ‘ starve herself – and i ca n’t do that ’			1
all the women in the programme have lost weight – only to pile it all ( and more ) back on			1

‘ i am obsessed with food – i love it , have no “ off ” button and lick the plate , ’ the @entity22 star tells the documentary			1
‘ at times i ’ve been so desperate to stop eating that i ’ve left the dinner table and gone and put a bikini on for 20 minutes , ’ she confesses			0
‘ but it still does n’t work			0
’ after appearing on @entity22 in 2010 she shed four stone – but piled it all back on when she broke her ankle			2

now a svelte size 10 , she has thrown away her fat clothes and is studying to become a personal trainer in a desperate attempt to stay slim – given that fact she can ‘ put on half a stone in weekend ’			2
we are a nation of yo - yo dieters , as so many of our celebrity friends such as @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity93 ' @entity92 prove			1
in fact it 's not unusual for a woman to lose 10 stone in a decade as her weight fluctuates			1
the average diet lasts just five and a half weeks , and the average woman will embark on 61 diets in her lifetime and spend around 31 years of her life trying unsuccessfully to lose weight			1
one such woman is 59 - year - old @entity106 who has been on a diet for three - quarters of her life - and even suffered a heart attack because of her weight			1
addicted to yo - yo dieting : viewers also meet @entity111 who has gone up and down six dress sizes over the last two decades			1
this is her at her thinnest struggle : ms @entity111 admits the real reason for her weight gain is because she lacks willpower - but also because ' it 's very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight ' like many women , she has lost weight – only to pile it back on and some more			1
over a 40 - year - period she has lost 27 stone but ended up 10 stone heavier			1
aged 15 , she was already 12 stone , going up to 26 stone at the age of 32			0
‘ i was addicted to food and this is what scuppered every diet			2
in the past , if i had any problem , my excuse was to overeat – it was the only thing in my life i could control at times			2
‘ i would also write off the whole day if it started badly food-wise			0
breakfast tended to be four or five slices of toast , then more pasta and bread throughout the day			0
it was like an illness – but no - one to blame but myself			2
’ now at the age of 59 , after developing diabetes and suffering a heart attack , she is desperately trying to adopt a healthier lifestyle and she the pounds before her weight kills her			0

she then dropped to under eight stone before piling on the pounds to go up to a size 18			0
she admits the real reason for her weight gain is because she lacks willpower - but also because ‘ it ’s very easy to get addicted to the cycle of losing weight ’			1
she explains : ‘ there is that feeling of euphoria when you get down to a size 12 or 14 that ’s addictive			0
it would n’t be exciting if you could always fit into size 10 jeans			0
