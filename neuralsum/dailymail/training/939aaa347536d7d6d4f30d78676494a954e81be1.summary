‘ there have been reports that i asked the owner of the hotel for a wake - up call at 3.45am on the morning he came to my room , but that is untrue			1
‘ he just turned up at my door , knocked and , when i opened it , was standing there holding two bottles of massage oil			0
he told me he wanted to give me a free massage and shower			2
‘ i do n’t know why he targeted me because i had n’t had any other problems with him			0
maybe it ’s because i ’m small and he knew i was in the room on my own			2

‘ i noticed the balcony door lock was n’t secured , ’ she added			0
‘ i fully believed they would eventually enter my room from the balcony and get inside with the intention of raping me			1
’ at 5am , an hour and a quarter after the ordeal began , miss @entity0 realised no one was coming to help her and decided to jump from her second - floor balcony			1
police have arrested the hotel 's owner , @entity19 , pictured , and said it could be six months to a year before the case goes to court ‘ i got dressed , tucked my passport into the waistband of my trousers and climbed over the balcony			1
i could n’t make a call on my mobile to get help because it was n’t working			0
‘ i did n’t take any of my other stuff , and i did n’t go back for it afterwards			0
i just wanted to escape			0
