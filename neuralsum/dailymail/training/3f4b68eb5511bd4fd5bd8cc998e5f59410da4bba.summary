by @entity0 last updated at 7:47 am on 9th december 2011 a @entity2 oil pipeline was blown up today in what has been described by the government as an act of sabotage by an armed terrorist group			1
the pipeline , carrying oil from the east of the country to a vital refinery in @entity13 , spilled flames and clouds of thick black smoke into the air over the city , which has been the epicentre of the protests against @entity2 president @entity21			1
' this is the main pipeline that feeds the @entity13 refinery , ' said @entity25 of the @entity27 - based @entity26			2
black sky : smoke pours across the @entity2 city of @entity13 after an oil pipeline was blown up , with both sides blaming each other in the anti-government protests blackout : the pipeline was a major one , carrying oil from the east of the country to a vital refinery in @entity13 , which is the home of the @entity42 protests @entity43 shootings : human rights observers have also reported seven people killed in @entity13 today by snipers the @entity26 also reported seven people killed in @entity13 today by snipers and in ' random ' shootings			1
the ferocity of @entity21 's crackdown on protests triggered desertions from the armed forces , and now thousands of army defectors have joined a guerrilla army staging hit - and - run attacks on security forces			0
the state news agency , @entity59 , said the pipeline was attacked in the @entity62 area to the northwest of the refinery on the outskirts of @entity13 , a city of 800,000 where - activists say - about 1,500 people have been killed in the crackdown			0
video footage of the pipeline ablaze shows a @entity2 army tank close by the billowing smoke			1
the @entity13 refinery serves part of @entity2 's domestic requirement for refined oil products			1
it is the second attack on an oil pipeline after @entity59 said saboteurs blew up an oil export pipeline near @entity13 in june , which carried oil from @entity2 's eastern oilfields to the @entity84 coast			1
gathering forces : demonstrators protesting against @entity2 's president @entity21 march through the streets in @entity13 as a campaign of civil disobedience looms widespread : there were also anti-assad protests in @entity94 , near @entity95 , as people openly show their dissent new view : with media outlets banned from @entity2 by @entity21 's regime these protest photos are some of the clearest yet showing the level of opposition to the government anti-assad activists are looking to step up their activity by calling for a nationwide strike on sunday - a working day - as the first stage in a campaign of civil disobedience against @entity21 's government			1
the @entity112 , the grassroots organisers of the peaceful protest movement said the campaign would include sit - ins , shop closures and strikes by public service workers and students			1
a similar call for a walkout two months ago had mixed results			0
shops and businesses in the southern province of @entity126 , cradle of @entity2 's eight - month - old popular revolt , shut for eight days at the end of october			2
@entity21 , whose family has ruled @entity2 for 41 years , has denied ordering his troops to kill peaceful protesters , saying only a " crazy " leader kills his own people			2
in a television interview with @entity136 of the @entity137 he distanced himself from the actions of the security forces , saying it was not his personal army - a disclaimer that @entity143 said was simply not credible			0
@entity21 is under growing international pressure , including a threat of sanctions from the @entity147 , to cease violent repression of protests			2
rejecting criticism of his government 's action , he told @entity136 that ' most of the people that have been killed are supporters of the government , not the vice versa '			0
@entity2 activists say around a quarter of the more than 4,500 deaths they have recorded in nine months of protest have been among the security forces			2
most foreign media have been excluded from @entity2 , making it hard to verify events independently			2
in the city of @entity13 and nearby areas in northwestern @entity2 people staged a general strike on october 26 , partly enforced by armed insurgents			1
but the two biggest cities of @entity172 and @entity173 were largely unaffected , and residents of the capital said on thursday that authorities appeared to be taking steps to thwart sunday 's planned action			0
some shopkeepers who sought to pay their bills to the government this week said they were told to wait until sunday when officials would visit their premises to collect the money - a veiled warning not to be closed			0
one resident also reported increased numbers of police and plainclothes security forces in @entity172			0
' every 10 metres you find a group of them , wearing normal clothes , ' she said			0
meanwhile , @entity194 has called on @entity195 to stay out of @entity2 's business or risk inflaming sectarian tensions that could ' blow this whole geopolitical space up '			1
@entity194 , along with @entity199 , vetoed a @entity202 - drafted @entity201 resolution in october that would have condemned @entity2 for a violent crackdown on the mass anti-government protests and threatened it with potential sanctions			1
speaking at @entity195 headquarters , @entity194 foreign minister @entity206 repeated @entity209 's unhappiness at the way a @entity201 resolution this year had been cited as the basis for a @entity195 operation that helped to topple @entity215 's @entity214			1
' when a crisis emerges , all political , religious and other forces should be ... encouraged to participate in dialogue , ' he said after meeting his @entity195 counterparts			2
@entity206 said outsiders should not ' pick and choose the sweethearts ' , and groups within a country that called for outside help were taking ' the wrong path '			0
death toll : president @entity21 ( centre left ) , pictured here meeting with a @entity230 delegation , has led a brutal crackdown against dissent ' not seeing threats that emanate from the current trends would be wrong , in my view , because those processes that are deeply rooted might come to the surface and blow this whole geopolitical space up , ' said @entity206			0
' we are , to be very frank with you , extremely concerned with the fact that we are seeing ( a ) growing divide within the @entity245 world , between the @entity246 and the @entity247			0
' unless we help reverse this negative trend , we might witness very dire events			0
' speaking at a news conference after @entity206 , @entity195 secretary - general @entity250 reiterated that the alliance had ' no intention whatsoever to intervene in @entity2 '			1
the @entity254 says more than 4,000 people have been killed in the crackdown by president @entity21 's government .			0
