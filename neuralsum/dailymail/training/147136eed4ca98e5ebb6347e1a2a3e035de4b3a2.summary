by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 8 january 2013 @entity3 's @entity2 modelling debut has been published @entity5 vogue , despite editor @entity6 saying the 10 - year - old was too young to appear in the magazine			1
the youngster 's shoot has appeared in the february edition of the fashion bible as an advertising feature for the label , even though the publication has new rules about no longer using models who are under the age of 16			1
@entity6 tweeted that ' @entity3 @ @entity2 does n't meet @entity4 model health initiative criteria of over 16 's only @ @entity21 ' on 17 december			1
@entity3 wearing @entity2 's iconic trenchcoat in the campaign which has caused controversy in the @entity4 offices @entity5 @entity4 editor @entity6 , left , said @entity3 's @entity2 shoot did not comply with her magazine 's health guidelines , but they have appeared as advertising in the february edition , right her @entity34 followers replied saying the policy should not apply to a child modelling children 's clothes in a childlike way			1
@entity41 fashion writer @entity40 replied to the editor , saying : it seems unlikely he 's exploited considering who he is ? not sexualised / under eating etc. i feel like the ad pose lets him be a kid			0
' @entity4 launched their @entity49 in the june 2012 edition , as ' a pact between the 19 international editors of @entity4 to encourage a healthier approach to body image within the industry '			2
the aim was to protect young , up - and - coming models from exploitation and sexualisation by no longer ' knowingly ' working with them			0
@entity3 , 10 , alongside @entity61 and @entity62 in the @entity2 campaign @entity6 tweeted explanations of why @entity4 would n't use @entity3 in editorial , that she had no control over advertising features , and that she felt different rules applied to child actors the editions also pledged ' to work with models who , in our view , are healthy and help to promote a healthy body image ' , and to ' be ambassadors for the message of healthy body image '			1
@entity6 stated at the time : ' as one of the fashion industry 's most powerful voices , @entity4 has a unique opportunity to engage with relevant issues where we feel we can make a difference			0
' a @entity4 spokesman told the @entity41 that in her tweet @entity6 meant she would not be using photographs of @entity90 and @entity92 's middle son as editorial - but that the images were advertising and therefore not under her jurisdiction , despite the magazine profiting from the advert being placed by @entity2			0
@entity5 @entity4 editor @entity6 tweeted that she would not be featuring @entity3 's photo shoot because it did not comply with the magazine 's model health initiative but the magazine has run editorial features with young actors , including 15 - year - old @entity105 , star of @entity107 , and @entity3 's modelling co-star @entity61 wondered why @entity6 was happy to do this , tweeting to the editor on december 18 : ' @ @entity111 what about features on - e.g. - @entity105 ? ' to this @entity6 replied : ' @ ebcampbell pre model health initiative rule			1
but child actors probably in a different category			0
' responding to speculation over her tweets , @entity6 commented : ' when i sent a tweet stating that @entity4 's @entity121 would prevent @entity4 editorial from employing @entity3 as a model , i meant exactly that			2
' in the june 2012 issue , this initiative was launched by @entity4 worldwide and prevents us from employing persons under the age of 16 to model adult fashion			2
' it made no value judgement about his appearance in an advertising campaign			0
it also does not mean that we will never feature somebody under 16 in the magazine in any guise , which might include a sportsperson , actor , son or daughter or grandchild or any other role that an under - 16 year old might appear			0
' additionally , @entity4 does not employ the models that feature in our advertising and therefore the @entity49 principles do not apply to appearing in an advert placed in the magazine			1
' @entity2 have placed @entity3 on a billboard above @entity152 in @entity153 @entity3 in his latest appearance on a billboard on @entity152 in @entity153			0
