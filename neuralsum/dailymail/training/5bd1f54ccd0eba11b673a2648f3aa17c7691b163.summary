by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 11 september 2013 after two years of allegations and a gruesome eight - day trial , @entity2 actor @entity1 was finally exonerated from some of the worst crimes imaginable yesterday			1
the jury at @entity8 took just five hours to clear the 48 - year - old of twelve sex offences against a young girl , including five of rape			1
the father - of - two had been left ‘ fighting for his life ’ in both a legal circus and a media scrum			1
@entity1 : innocent , but named and shamed			0
exactly when will men get pre-conviction anonymity in rape trials ? , asks @entity0 in his willingness to co-operate , he revealed his private self for public scrutiny : a ‘ troubled man ’ who chain - smoked , drank up to 12 pints a night , had a string of one - night stands and an affair with a younger woman while his wife had cancer treatment			1
now , he is free			0
but , like thousands of men all over the world , @entity1 ’s life has already been destroyed by a system which considers men ’s innocence a bonus - not a baseline			1
and it has to end			0
the case not only proved that pre-conviction identification does n’t work , but reiterated a very pertinent question : why , in our best - ever age of equality and human rights , are men still being denied their right to anonymity ahead of a guilty verdict ? it is - quite frankly - inhumane and has no place in a civilised society			1
naturally , the @entity54 defended the case being brought to trial , saying : ‘ it is for the jury to determine whether a defendant is guilty or not and we of course respect the verdicts they have reached today			1
’ but the @entity54 is not middle @entity64			1
regardless of yesterday ’s ruling , millions of onlookers will favour their own agenda - driven conclusion to that of an informed jury			2
haters across the world will decide that he is guilty by default			2
that he is a rapist simply because he is male			0
they will gather around the water cooler and say : ‘ there ’s no smoke without fire ’ or ‘ he looks the type ’			0
this , ladies and gentlemen , is precisely why a court of law , not a casual observer who is not armed with all the evidence , should convict a defendant			0
haters across the world , including some of the most sexist women in journalism , will decide that he is guilty by default			2
that he is a rapist simply because he is male let ’s be clear : @entity1 is not a man i would like to befriend , nor do i condone much of his behaviour			0
but my heart went out to him yesterday			0
for all his faults , for all his demons , he is a victim of our politically correct ( yet morally incorrect ) legal system			1
a creaking , dilapidated machine which has scant regard for men ’s rights and the immortality of a rape allegation			1
earlier this year , one of the legal profession ’s most prominent women - deputy high court judge @entity113 - agreed			1
she recommended that men be granted pre-conviction anonymity in rape trials as standard			1
tellingly , her opinion is held by the majority of @entity123			1
in 2010 , a poll conducted by @entity125 showed that 67 per cent of readers want pre-conviction anonymity for rape defendants , as opposed to 33 per cent who do n’t			1
originally , the law agreed			0
in 1976 , the @entity131 government introduced anonymity for both the alleged victim and the accused			2
it operated this way until 1988 , when guidelines were relaxed to help police investigations			2
at the time , the media was far less powerful , less global , less permanent than it is today			1
there was no internet , no gossip magazines , no mobile phones and no social networking sites			0
police techniques and technology were also less refined , so a lack of anonymity helped them			1
now , things are different			0
and - once again - the law should change to reflect this			2
why ? because a ‘ not guilty ’ verdict is no longer enough to repair the planet - sized crater of damage caused by weeks of daily headlines across the globe			1
perhaps more importantly , it ’s also a human right to be innocent until proven guilty			1
suspiciously , feminists like @entity163 disagree			0
in fact , she once said being falsely accused was n’t so bad			2
' a fair number of celebrities have been accused of rape in the past and do not seem to have suffered longer term , ' she wrote in the @entity171			2
' to say that an accusation ruins lives is perhaps a sweeping generalisation			0
' perhaps she should speak to @entity176			0
in 2009 , he was cleared by a jury in just 40 minutes after being falsely accused of rape by a woman he met through a one - night stand			1
although he was exonerated , the incident was so traumatic that he changed his name and left the country			2
his life was utterly destroyed			2
meanwhile , the accuser kept her anonymity - and , for all we know , went on to accuse others			1
where ’s the fairness in that ? ' for all his faults , for all his demons , he is a victim of our politically correct ( yet morally incorrect ) legal system			1
a creaking , dilapidated machine which has scant regard for men ’s rights and the immortality of a rape allegation ' less than one year ago , in december 2012 , the former boyfriend of @entity203 suffered a similar situation when he was the subject of a malicious , fictitious allegation			1
@entity207 was eventually acquitted - but only after his name had been tarnished and his character assassinated			2
during the case , @entity210 ’s @entity209 heard that his accuser was ‘ so drunk she could n’t stand up or walk ’ - but @entity215 footage secured by @entity207 ’ brother ( not the police ) proved otherwise			1
had it not been for this auspicious turn , he would ’ve been serving a ten - year sentence			2
‘ it was absolute torture being locked in a glass box in court listening to shocking lies being said about you , ’ he told @entity221 ‘ i was so close to my life being over - and i had done nothing wrong			1
’ his lawyer , @entity230 , added : ‘ what is unbelievable is that if we had n’t found them coming out of the club on @entity215 , which the police had totally failed to identify , there was a real risk of a miscarriage of justice			2
’ that ’s because not every allegation is true			0
and , sadly , not every case that reaches court deserves to be there			0
even @entity123 charity @entity245 admit that almost five per cent of rape allegations are fake - ' exactly the same as any other crime '			1
this means that countless men will be named and shamed in the media			1
simply because they are male - not because they are guilty			1
it goes without saying that i despise rape - i despise any crime of that ilk			2
but what i equally hate is injustice			0
and , contrary to yesterday 's verdict , that 's exactly what has been handed to @entity1 to say this does n’t matter is not only insane , but dangerous			2
it also smacks of a darker gender agenda			0
ironically , women like @entity163 are enraged at the concept of pre-conviction anonymity , yet so few of them are equally outraged by the false accusers who betray the sisterhood ( and the real victims of rape - both male and female ) with their lies			1
yet these women are damaging rape justice more than pre-conviction anonymity ever could			2
yes , i sympathise that not every case is reported			0
i also sympathise that not every victim gets justice			0
but none of these facts validate the hell imposed on innocent sons , brothers , fathers and boyfriends every single day			0
even @entity288 , who introduced the 1976 law providing mutual pre-conviction anonymity , argued this until his death in february 2012			0
he told the @entity303 in 2002 : ‘ rape is a uniquely serious offence and acquittal is not enough to clear a man in the eyes of his family , community or workplace			0
he is left with this indelible stain on his reputation			0
the case for matching anonymity for the defendant is as strong now as ever ’			0
he was right in life and he ’s right in death			0
besides , the benefit of mutual anonymity would cut across both genders , helping victims as well as conserving fair trials			0
for a start , it would deter anyone from making false claims out of spite , seeing the accuracy of convictions rise - not fall			2
secondly , it could make testifying easier for those who ’ve come forward			0
identifying the accused often inadvertently identifies the victim , which adds immense pressure for them			0
the issue is made even more complex when our government officials muddy the waters of truth			0
in 2010 , an official enquiry report led by @entity334 - a prison reform campaigner - ordered @entity335 to stop misleading the public about rape statistics			1
for years she ’d been pumping misinformation that only six per cent of rapists are brought to justice , when the reality is very different			0
but @entity346 ’s creepy spin is symptomatic of another problem , because the way we criminalise men in these situations seems to have become political , rather than judicial			0
instead of securing robust , fair trials , people now want a system were woman have all the power - and men are on the back foot - as if this would guarantee justice			1
our modern - day legal system should not be throwing men to the lions in a bid to prove it opposes rape			1
it is not a pr exercise for the police or the @entity54			1
it is peoples ’ lives			0
it goes without saying that i despise rape – i despise any crime of that ilk			0
but what i equally hate is injustice			0
and , contrary to yesterday ’s verdict , that ’s exactly what has been handed to @entity1			0
sadly , there are thousands of other men who , unbeknown to them , are next in line			0
an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that ' @entity123 charity @entity245 admit that almost 1 in 10 rape allegations are fake '			1
we are happy to clarify that this figure was mistakenly derived from a 2005 @entity393 study which stated that police statistics claiming 8 % of rape allegations were false , was in fact incorrect and that the figure of false allegations sits at around 3 %			1
the most recent @entity54 study of false allegations gives a statistic of less than 1 %			1
we apologise for this error			2

men 's rights campaigner and *writer* @entity0 says it is time the ' *unjust* ' legal system was *overhauled*
