' my youngest son @entity41 , who 's four , loves telling everyone that his daddy does n't have a big belly anymore though - my kids are my biggest supporters			2
' @entity7 said his eating habits became such a problem that he would often eat in secret while he was at work			2
he tried lots of diets without success before @entity30 suggested they join @entity29 together			1
@entity7 lost weight due to a combination of exercise and making healthy meal choices @entity7 's wife @entity30 , left , also joined @entity29 and lost and impressive five stone herself @entity7 said : ' i would get out of breath easily , even just climbing the stairs in our house , so i did n't really play games or sports with the kids and i worried i was setting a bad example to them			1
' i tried to put it to the back of my mind but when i saw the photo of me and my eldest son @entity21 , who was eight at the time , i knew i needed to do something			0
name : @entity7 age : 34 height : @entity79 starting weight : 17st 12lbs/250lbs/114kg current weight : 13st 5lbs/187lbs/85kg weight loss : 4st 7lbs/63lbs/29kg starting waist measurement : 38in current weight measurement : 30in ' i was the heaviest i 'd ever been and my confidence level was pretty much zero			1
that photograph was a real wake - up call			0
' @entity7 said although he was nervous about joining the group he knew it was the right thing to do : ' i was worried about being the only man at @entity29 and thought i 'd stick out like a sore thumb , so i was really glad i had @entity30 with me on that first night			1
' @entity94 was so welcoming though and within a couple of weeks my nerves had disappeared			0
' i started to look forward to going to @entity29 each week , of course because i wanted to know how much weight i 'd lost but i wanted to see how everyone else had got on too			2
' @entity7 followed the group 's healthy eating plan and quickly began to see the results			2
in his first week @entity7 lost 3.5lbs and within five months he 'd reached his first target , losing 4st 1lb			2

@entity7 says : ' i could n't believe the change in me in just a few months			0
i 'm quite competitive and i loved collecting the awards that you get for every 7lbs you lose			0
' they made me want to keep going for the next milestone and i 've got all the certificates stuck to our fridge			0
' @entity30 and @entity7 have lost an impressive nine and a half stone between them in the last year @entity7 says that one of the best things about losing weight is that his children are really proud of him @entity7 said the group helped him to completely overhaul his diet : ' we were always a ' jar family ' using pre-prepared sauces and convenience foods and we had a lot of takeaways - sometimes four or five times a week - just because it was easy			1
' but we started cooking from scratch and now the whole family eats the same meals			0
we love homemade curries , they taste just like the takeaways we used to have but obviously they 're a lot better for you			0
' @entity7 's fitness has improved too			2
he no longer gets out of breath and has more energy : ' work is a lot easier now and i 've joined a gym			0
' best of all , i can run around with the kids and practice rugby with @entity21 at the park - i 've gone from feeling like a failed parent to feeling like a proud dad			0
' before embarking on his weight loss plan , @entity7 would think nothing of wolfing down hearty meals @entity30 has also found success with @entity29 , having lost around 5st			1
@entity7 says : ' i could n't believe it when i found out i 'd won the title of mr @entity157 and @entity30 was over the moon for me , especially because she knew she 'd get to see me in a suit for the first time in years			1
' we 're both so proud of each other - it 's amazing to think we 've lost nearly 10st between us in a year - and i 'm so glad we 've done this together			1
' i hope my story will show people , especially other men , that losing weight does n't have to be hard and it really is possible to make your @entity170 's resolutions come true			0
' @entity172 and i recreated the photo that made me want to start losing weight , i looked like a different bloke - and i feel like one too			0
