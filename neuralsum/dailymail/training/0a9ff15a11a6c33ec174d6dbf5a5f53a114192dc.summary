by @entity0 published : 04:09 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 10:04 est , 25 june 2012 @entity3 treatment early in adulthood dramatically increases a woman 's chance of developing breast cancer , research suggests			1
women who started taking fertility drugs and went through @entity3 around their 24th birthday were found to have a 56 per cent greater chance of developing breast cancer than those in the same age group who went through treatments without @entity3			1
but there was no increased risk for women who started fertility treatments when they were about 40 years old , regardless of whether they had @entity3 or not , according to the @entity22 study a micro-needle ( left ) about to inject human sperm into a human egg cell			0
estrogen levels are elevated during @entity3 the researchers said : ' for younger women there is some cause for concern , because it appears that they may face an increased risk of breast cancer after @entity3 treatment			1
' the findings were based on a study of more than 21,000 women and published in the journal @entity39 and @entity40			0
study author @entity41 from the @entity42 said younger women might see an increased risk of breast cancer because they are exposed to higher levels of circulating estrogen during their cycles of @entity3 treatment			1
in the @entity49 45,264 women had ivf treatment in 2010			0
a third of women under 35 successfully had a child as a result however , she added : ' i do n't think it 's a huge increased risk that you should worry or panic ( about )			0
' the researchers collected information on 21,025 women between the ages of 20 and 40 who went through fertility treatment at the hospitals of @entity66 between 1983 and 2002			0
they were able to piece together enough data to follow the women for some 16 years to see if they developed breast cancer			0
roughly 1.7 per cent of the 13,644 women who only used fertility drugs without @entity3 ended up developing breast cancer by the end of the study			1
that figure was about two percent for women who used fertility drugs and underwent @entity3 - a difference that researchers said was n't statistically significant			0
this changed when women were divided into different age groups , with women aged 24 about one - and - a - half times more likely to develop breast cancer if they had @entity3 alongside other fertility treatments			2
however , @entity84 said they could n't yet say that @entity3 was causing the increased cancer risk in younger women , as these women could be different in some significant way from those who only have other types of fertility treatment			1
' if for example , younger women who had @entity3 were more likely to have a specific cause of infertility , and this was related to an increased risk of breast cancer , then it would appear that @entity3 was related to breast cancer when in fact it was the type of infertility that was more common in women who had @entity3 , ' she said			1
@entity103 , president - elect of the @entity104 , added : ' the development of breast cancer is linked to estrogen exposure and the longer one is exposed , the greater the risk			0
' in an ivf cycle there is a short , but significant elevation in circulating estrogen , and whether this is linked to the observations found in the study is not clear at this time			2
' the older the patient is the less likely they are to conceive via ivf the researchers said the study results would reassure women who start @entity3 treatment in their 30s and 40s			2
however , they added : ' women should be aware that delivering their Ô¨Årst child late in reproductive life , whether assisted by @entity3 or not , is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer			2
' statistically , younger women have a greater chance of successfully having a baby following @entity3			1
they suggested a follow - up study of women who undergo a greater range of cycles to see if there 's a connection between @entity3 ' dose ' and breast cancer rate .			0

cancer link ' some cause for concern ' for younger women trying to conceive
link could be because women undergoing @entity3 exposed to higher levels of circulating estrogen
