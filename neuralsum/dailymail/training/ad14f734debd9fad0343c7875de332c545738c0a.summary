satellite images taken by @entity1 have unveiled a mystery construction complex in the middle of the @entity5 desert			1
former @entity7 analyst @entity6 was looking for an orbital tracking site near the city of @entity10 in southwestern @entity5 , when the strange lines and buildings caught his eye			1
what appears to be a collection of structures and roads have baffled the expert who has been left puzzling what they might be			0
on the map : the complex of roads and large buildings in the middle of the desert in south @entity5 to which there appears to be no explanation ‘ i have n’t the faintest clue what it might be , ’ he told @entity31			1
‘ but it ’s extensive , the structures are pretty big and funny - looking , and it went up in what i ’d call an incredible hurry			0
’ mr @entity40 , who left the @entity7 in 1985 , has discovered similarly strange things on @entity1 before , such as the giant jigsaw grids in @entity5 in 2011 which appeared to be satellite calibrator grids			1
but this time he has been left with no clue as to what it may be			0
it is not the first time strange patterns and buildings have been uncovered in remote parts of @entity5 using @entity1			1
going nowhere : an overview of the entire area with the yellow line marking the strange construction , miles away from civilisation before : the site in june 2011 when only the foundations of the large constructions have been build @entity60 works : this picture from june 21st 2011 show the foundations of the main building six months later : a photo of the same site taken in november 2011 , indicating a quick building process in 2011 patterns were discovered in the @entity69 desert in @entity5 's north - east interior which remain unexplained			2
however , this did not stop people from guessing , taking to online forums to establish their origins			0
some claimed that they were ' codes ' designed to be read by @entity77 , to fears that they were missile practice targets modelled on @entity80 cities , before researchers came to the slightly less scary conclusion that some , at least , were used to calibrate cameras in @entity5 's spy satellites			0
late the same year , also in the @entity69 , buildings and ‘ masonic - looking ’ road structures led to a number of more or less serious theories as to what the secretive superpower might be up to including nuclear bomb - making , @entity94 test range and driving schools			0
blink and you 'll miss it : the ' western buildings ' of the complex , pictured six months apart @entity101 start : former @entity7 analyst @entity6 noticed the speed with which these buildings , seen here is the middle construction in june 2011 , had been put up , seemingly in the middle of nowhere getting there , but where ? november 16 there has been some significant progress to the mystery constructions			2

*unidentified* buildings found in desert in southwest @entity5
complex of roads and houses spotted on @entity1 by @entity120 analyst
appears to have been built ' in a hurry ' but no *answers* as to what it may be
