@entity0 thinks @entity2 boss @entity1 should take a great deal of credit for the role he played in helping him earn his ' dream ' @entity8 call - up			1
@entity0 was drafted into the @entity8 squad following the withdrawal of @entity11 and could make his debut in friday 's @entity14 qualifier against @entity15 or the friendly in @entity17 next tuesday			1
if selected , @entity0 would regard it as the proudest moment of his career			2
@entity0 tracks @entity21 in training after winning his first @entity8 call - up this week @entity0 says it would be his dream to be handed a first @entity8 cap against @entity15 or @entity17 this week the @entity2 midfielder has been in superb form this season , prompting @entity29 to select him ' it 's every boy 's dream to represent their country at any level , so hopefully i can get that and it would be a great achievement personally , ' the 23 - year - old @entity2 midfielder told @entity39 ' it 's the pinnacle of your career to represent your country			1
' @entity0 's route to the top has been far from straightforward			1
he signed for @entity2 's academy as a 16 - year - old and just 12 months later he made his debut in a @entity50 match against @entity51			1
but he then had to wait another six years until he made his @entity53 debut			0
former @entity2 boss @entity54 farmed @entity0 out to @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , where he had three loan spells			1
@entity54 's successor @entity59 then sent the player to @entity62 club @entity61 but he returned without having made a first - team appearance			2
@entity64 made his @entity2 debut six years ago , but has spent the intervening time on several loan deals neither @entity54 or @entity59 saw a place for him in the first team , but he is now showing form @entity0 started last season on loan at @entity72 and did not feature under @entity73 at @entity2 once @entity59 had been sacked			1
@entity0 is grateful to @entity1 , therefore , for finally giving him a chance at @entity75 this season			1
' i 've always had confidence in my own ability , but it also comes from a manager who trusts you and is willing to back you			2
there is nothing like that as a footballer , ' said @entity0 , who has played 29 times for the @entity87 this year			2
' the fact that the call - up has come so early in my @entity53 career is a great feeling			0
it 's amazing and has been a bit of a whirlwind over the last few months @entity0 thanked @entity1 for the faith the @entity87 manager has shown in him this season last year @entity0 was on loan at @entity98 in @entity72 , but has made remarkable progress since returning ' it was unfortunate that i did n't kick on at a younger age , it took me a bit longer to establish myself			1
' i had a lot of injuries and perhaps went out on loan at the wrong times			0
' there were times when players were getting opportunities in the @entity50 and i was out on loan			0
it just never really worked			0
but now i 've got a manager who trusts in me and believes in me , and he came in from day one and said that			0
' to have a manager like that it gives me a great deal of confidence			0
' now i 'm playing regularly i 'm more than happy			0
' @entity0 has been pinching himself this week after training alongside some of his heroes at @entity125			0
' i 've been a football fan for so long , and the fact that i 've been watching these players in the squad who i 'm training with now is a great feeling , ' he said .			0
