the @entity0 yesterday refused to reveal how many households are dodging the licence fee by watching television programmes on the internet			1
it is thought many of the one million homes which do not pay the charge watch programmes legally on internet catch - up services , such as the @entity9 , which do not need a licence to use			1
the loophole is believed to be costing the corporation millions a year in lost revenue from the £ 145.50 annual fee			1
the @entity0 turned down a freedom of information request asking for the number of households who had said they did n't need a licence fee and critics accused the @entity0 of ' refusing to answer legitimate questions ' by concealing how many people were using the online loophole to avoid payment			1
@entity25 , chairman of the @entity26 , urged the corporation to publish the figures so the public could have a ' proper debate ' on the future of the licence fee			1
the first licence fee was issued in november 1922 for radio users , and cost a princely 10 shillings ( 50p )			0
the first combined radio / tv licence - for £ 2 - was issued in june 1946			2
as television became popular , radio - only licences were abolished in february 1971			0
the first supplementary licence fee for colour tv was introduced in january 1968			2
the original iplayer service was launched as a five - month trial in october 2005 , with 5,000 broadband users testing it			0
it was then gradually rolled out and made available to more people across the @entity46 until in 2011 an international version was launched			0
a television licence is not needed to watch iplayer content after it has been broadcast			0
however , the ' watch live ' option , which broadcasts some channels simultaneously with television demands a valid tv licence			2
he said : ' the licence fee was created when television was in a different world , when there was very little choice and everybody watched the @entity0			0
' today people have access to hundreds of channels as well as downloads , catch - up services and on demand			1
' as more and more choice is available , the arguments for having a licence fee no longer hold			0
' it is important that figures for things like how many people are avoiding the licence fee by using catch - up services are released so there can be an informed discussion about what to do about the fee			1
' almost all the @entity0 's programmes are available on the internet catch - up service and can be viewed just a few minutes after they have finished on television			1
some programmes , such as a forthcoming @entity86 sitcom , are even being made available on iplayer first			0
the idea looks set to be extended after the @entity0 approved a 12 - month trial which would allow up to 40 hours of programming to be shown on @entity0 online before transmission on tv			2
it means licence fee payers without access to @entity9 are funding programmes they can not watch , which could be seen first by those who are escaping the charge			1
comedian @entity86 , left , is to star in a sitcom that will be shown on @entity9 before terrestrial channels , while @entity102 chair @entity25 , right , said the @entity103 and @entity0 should discuss an alternative to the licence fee last year , 2.32billion tv and radio programmes were watched on the @entity9 , a figure boosted by the coverage of the @entity110			1
viewers who use only the internet catch - up services can respond to letters from tv licensing by making what it calls a ' no licence fee needed claim '			1
when a newspaper submitted a freedom of information request , asking how many people were exploiting the ' catch - up ' loophole to avoid paying their licence fee , the @entity0 refused to reveal the figures			1
it said the ' disclosure would , or would be likely to , prejudice the prevention or detection of crime [ and ] the collection of the licence fee '			0
@entity133 said this was because the information would be ' of use to those seeking to evade paying the licence fee '			0
some programmes are even being made available on @entity9 before they are broadcast @entity140 , of the @entity141 , said : ' it is very disappointing that the @entity0 are refusing to answer legitimate questions			2
' it is attempts to enforce the law that are protected in the @entity147 , not attempts to confuse people into paying more than they should			0
' the @entity0 estimates that £ 196million of revenue was lost in 2009/10 due to licence fee evasion			2
it added : ' the @entity0 does not anticipate a significant loss of income from the number of people who pay the licence fee due to catch - up viewing			1
' the number of people watching only catch - up tv is less than 2 per cent per week			1
' the licence fee model has shown itself resilient enjoying greater public support today than it did 20 years ago and at 40p per day it remains good value to audiences			2
' who needs a tv licence ? anyone watching or recording tv programmes on any channel as they are being broadcast			0
whatever device you use to watch programmes – a tv set , computer , laptop or mobile phone – you must pay the £ 145.50 licence fee			1
over- 75s are entitled to a free licence			0
anyone without a valid licence risks prosecution and a fine of up to £ 1,000			0
@entity184 ? programmes on the @entity9 , the @entity0 ’s catch - up service , provided you view them after they have been broadcast			1
those using the @entity9 ’s @entity190 function , which broadcasts eight channels at virtually the same time as on tv , will need a licence			2
how many are viewing online to @entity196 ? the @entity0 wo n’t reveal how much revenue it is losing because people watch online but it is likely to be well into the millions			2
three per cent of people do n’t pay a licence fee , equal to a million households , but it ’s unclear how many of them are using iplayer			1
@entity207 watches live or catch - tv ? it ca n't			1
anyone not paying a licence fee has to submit a declaration that they are not watching or recording live broadcasts			0
licence enforcers can make house visits to check and if your explanation is accepted , they put your account on ‘ hold ’ for two years , before investigating again			0
could non-fee payers be charged for @entity9 ? possibly , but it would be complicated			0
the @entity0 could introduce a system similar to @entity226 , under which customers can not watch any programmes on tv sets , laptops , or mobile devices without an @entity233 code			0
however , this would involve an enormous amount of bureaucracy			0
equally , the @entity0 could not charge all viewers to watch @entity9 , because existing licence holders would end up paying twice for the same service			2
@entity241 only ‘ live ’ programmes on @entity9 are the eight @entity0 channels screened on the @entity190 section , for which you still need a licence			0
most other programmes are available on catch - up .			1

more than a million households do not pay the £ 145.50 annual fee
corporation fears it could lose out if the figure was known to the public
many people legally watch tv through catch - up services such as @entity9
