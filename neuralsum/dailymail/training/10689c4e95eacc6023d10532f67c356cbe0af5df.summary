’ a dust devil is a strong , well - formed , and relatively long - lived whirlwind , ranging from small ( half a meter wide and a few meters tall ) to large ( more than 10 meters wide and more than 1,000 meters tall )			2
the primary vertical motion is upward			0
dust devils are usually harmless , but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property			2
conditions in the park on sunday were ideal for a dust devil , which according to @entity41 typically forms ‘ on a clear day when the ground is heated by the sun , warming the air just above the ground			1
' as heated air near the surface rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler air above it , the air may begin to rotate , if conditions are just right			0
