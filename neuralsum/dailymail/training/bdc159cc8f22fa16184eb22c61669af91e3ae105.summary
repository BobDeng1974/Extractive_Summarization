he appeared on @entity32 ’s @entity31 sporting a tan just after returning from holiday			0
presenter @entity35 challenged the union boss about why he was still living in a housing association home in @entity32 , when he was on such a high wage			2
she suggested that if he moved out , the home could be used for a family on a waiting list for social housing who might currently be living in overcrowded accommodation			1
mr @entity2 said that if he did move out into a private home , it would be unfair on his family			2

mr @entity2 said the reason behind the shortage of social housing was not because of people like him , but because of @entity91 ’s policy of right to buy , which allowed council housing tenants to buy their own homes			2
but a ban on councils building their own homes meant that these were never replenished – causing a shortage			0
he also denied he was the recipient of ‘ subsidised rent ’ , even though his rent will be much less than the market rents for similar properties in his area .			0
