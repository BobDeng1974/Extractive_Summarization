clothing giant @entity3 has come under fire for its shopping trolley policy
customers *reported* on retailer 's @entity11 page about being denied entry
they said they were told it was because their trolleys could ' hurt people '
but @entity3 says it is part of their store policy to not allow trolleys inside
a spokeswoman said injuries happened more often with trolleys in store
