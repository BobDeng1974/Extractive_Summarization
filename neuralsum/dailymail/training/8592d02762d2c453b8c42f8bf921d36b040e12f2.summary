by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 04:46 est , 1 june 2012 they have only ever existed for less than a second , but two new elements were named yesterday - @entity4 and @entity5			1
do n't expect to find lumps of them lying around - the elements were created by slamming lighter atoms together in a particle accelerator			1
they joined the @entity12 of elements - which hangs on science classroom walls around the world - last year , but were only named today			1
what used to be element 114 is now flerovium , honoring the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , where it was created			1
they have only ever existed for less than a second , but two new elements were named yesterday - @entity4 and @entity5 element 116 is now livermorium , for the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , home of a scientific team that participated in its creation in @entity19			1
scientists have been unable to study their properties , such as which chemicals they would react with because they are so unstable and disappear soon after they are created			1
the chemical symbols are @entity4 and @entity5			2
both names had been proposed last year by the scientists who made the materials by smashing atoms together			2
final approval was announced wednesday by the @entity38			0
creation : the elements were formed in a heavy ion accelerator at the @entity18 in @entity19 ( pictured ) the man - made elements were created by a team from @entity20 and another from the @entity44 who slammed together the nuclei of lighter atoms in an accelerator			1
they reported the results from the experiments in 2004 and 2006			0
the @entity12 , which hangs in science classrooms around the world , arranges all the known chemical elements according to their atomic number			0
this number reflects how many protons they have in their nucleus			0
the heaviest natural element is plutonium with an atomic number of 94			0
all heavier elements have been produced synthetically element 116 lasts for only milliseconds before it decays into element 114			1
this in turns lasts for about half a second before becoming @entity69 , which joined the table in 2009			0
as newly former elements become heavier and heavier , scientists hope they will become far more stable than the fragments of synthetic matter produced so far			2
some have theorised that elements with 120 or more protons would exist in an ' island of stability			0
' this would mean that they would decay much more slowly with half - lives of days compared to seconds			0
some scientists have even postulated that half - lives could take millions of years .			2

elements created in @entity20 particle accelerator
element 114 is now ' @entity4 ' - named after the *lab* where it was created
scientists unable to discover their properties as they disappear so *quickly*
