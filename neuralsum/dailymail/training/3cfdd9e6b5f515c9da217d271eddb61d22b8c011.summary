amid the latest furore over @entity3 ’s spending , it is worth noting that @entity4 could have been walking out at the @entity5 in blue on sunday had the @entity8 champions not been operating under tighter financial restrictions last summer			1
when it became clear that @entity4 was leaving @entity12 , city manager @entity10 considered entering the bidding for his @entity15 compatriot			1
it soon became clear , however , that the £ 30million fee agreed between @entity12 and @entity18 was too much for the reduced transfer budget imposed on @entity3 by @entity20			1

reflecting on the issue , @entity10 said : ‘ it was n’t easy			0
he was a very expensive player in that moment			0

contact was made between @entity3 and the player ’s camp but @entity4 had set his heart on joining @entity12			1
‘ when they stopped picking up the phone or returning calls , we knew we ’d lost him , ’ said a club source			0
realising that @entity67 were circling around @entity54 , @entity3 moved quickly to avoid missing out on their other leading target and agreed a £ 38m fee with @entity70 to sign the @entity71			1
@entity54 is ‘ 100 per cent fit ’ after a knee injury , according to @entity10 , and the shootout between him and @entity4 will be the highlight of sunday ’s clash between @entity3 and @entity18 at the @entity5 — a fixture that produced a thrilling 6 - 3 win for the home team last season			1

‘ i do n’t want to compare him with @entity54 , ’ added @entity10			0
‘ i think @entity4 is a very good player , he is having a very good season in @entity91			2
‘ it is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals			0
‘ @entity4 is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at @entity12 and scoring a lot			1
i am very happy for him because he is a very enthusiastic young player and improving			0
‘ it is not the first year from @entity4 here in @entity102			2
he had eight or nine years when he was very young in @entity103 with @entity55 and then returned on loan to @entity105			0
he played really well in @entity12 and now in @entity91			2
the football fans in @entity15 are very happy for him and for the country			0
’ @entity4 races away from @entity47 defender @entity109 12 goals in the @entity8 in his debut season comparisons between @entity4 and @entity3 striker @entity54 have dominated the build - up to the game @entity3 boss @entity10 says @entity4 is performing very well in the @entity8 this season @entity4 hits a free - kick against @entity47 to score @entity18 's third goal of the game and complete the victory @entity117 will miss sunday 's clash with @entity18 on the expectations for the clash with @entity18 , he added : ‘ it is difficult to score six and three goals again , but i think for fans it will be a very attractive game			1

there was more troubling news for @entity10 when @entity144 once again cast doubt over his future at the club in an interview at the @entity149			0
@entity144 and his agent caused a bizarre issue last summer by hitting out at @entity3 for failing to acknowledge the midfielder ’s 31st birthday with a cake and , allegedly , grant him compassionate leave to see his dying brother @entity156			1

i ’m at @entity3 at the moment			0
