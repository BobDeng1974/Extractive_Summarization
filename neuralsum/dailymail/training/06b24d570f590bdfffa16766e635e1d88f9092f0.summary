‘ at the outbreak of war and for some time afterwards the @entity4 gold incident still rankled , ’ the online documents state			0
the @entity6 helped sell a further £ 860,000 of @entity26 gold in june 1939 – without waiting for approval			1
but the government halted all transactions on the outbreak of the @entity31			0
it is also believed the @entity6 still holds some ingots of the gold with a swastika stamped on them			1

but less has been known about the @entity6 ’s role under then governor sir @entity44			2
the papers said : ‘ the @entity6 referred the matter to the chancellor , who said that he would like the opinion of the @entity49			2
‘ on the @entity39 enquiring , however , what was causing the delay and saying that inconvenience would be caused because of payments the next day , the @entity6 acted on the instructions referring to the law officers , who , however , subsequently upheld their action			2
