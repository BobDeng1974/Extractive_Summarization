scan : an improved version of @entity3 can spot the earliest stages of life - threatening diseases , researchers have said			1
pictured is a doctor helping a patient with an mri scan a new scanner can spot the earliest stages of life - threatening diseases including cancers in seconds , researchers say			1
the early detection could see the disease picked up when they are at their most treatable			1
the device is an improved version of @entity3 ( magnetic resonance imaging ) which is currently used by doctors to pick up tumours , multiple sclerosis , heart disease and other illnesses			1
at present the amount of detail that can be probed is limited but @entity26 ( magnetic resonance fingerprinting ) can collect a vast amount of information in one measurement			0
it uses mathematical formulas called pattern - recognition algorithms to figure out in a few seconds if a patient has anything to worry about			1
each body tissue and disease has a unique fingerprint that can be used to quickly diagnose problems , say the scientists			1
by using their technology to look for different physical properties simultaneously they differentiated white and grey matter from cerebrospinal fluid in the brain in about 12 seconds			1
they promise to do this much quicker in the near future and believe an mri scan will be standard procedure in annual check - ups			0
a full - body scan lasting only minutes would provide far more information , making diagnostics cheap			1
dr @entity57 , professor of radiology at @entity59 , in @entity60 , said : ' the overall goal is to specifically identify individual tissues and diseases , to hopefully see things and quantify things before they become a problem			2
' but to try to get there we 've had to give up everything we knew about the mri and start over			0
' @entity3 is a radiology technique which uses magnets , radio waves and a computer to produce a range of images of the body 's tissues and structures			1
treatable : the early detection could see diseases picked up when they are at their most treatable			2
pictured is a human cancer cell @entity26 can obtain much more information with each measurement than a traditional mri			0
prof @entity57 , who spent three years developing it , likens the difference to a pair of choirs			0
he said : ' in the traditional @entity3 everyone is singing the same song and you can tell who is singing louder , who is off - pitch , who is singing softer			1
but that 's about it			0
' information : according to the scientists , the amount of detail which can be probed from an mri scan ( pictured ) is limited , but @entity26 can collect a vast amount of inforamtion in one measurement the louder , softer and off - pitch singing is represented by dark , light or bright spots in the scan a radiologist must interpret			0
for example an @entity3 would show swelling as a bright area in an image			2
but brightness does n't necessarily equate with severity or cause			0
prof @entity57 said : ' with an @entity26 we hope with one step we can tell the severity and exactly what 's happening in that area			0
' the fingerprint of each tissue , disease and material inside the body is therefore a different song			1
in an @entity26 each member of the choir sings a different song simultaneously			0
prof @entity57 , whose machine is described in the journal nature , said : ' what it sounds like in total is a randomised mess			0
' other researchers have tried to use multiple parameters in @entity3 's but this group was able to scan fast and with higher sensitivity than in previous attempts			2
prof @entity57 said : ' this research gives us hope			0
we can see it 's possible the @entity3 can see all sorts of things			2
' the group expects to reduce scanning time and continue to build the songbook - or library of fingerprints - over the next few years .			2

improved version of @entity3 could detect life - threatening diseases when they are at their most treatable
uses mathematical formulas to figure out in a matter of seconds if a patient has anything to worry about
uses unique fingerprints of each individual body tissue and disease to quickly diagnose problems
