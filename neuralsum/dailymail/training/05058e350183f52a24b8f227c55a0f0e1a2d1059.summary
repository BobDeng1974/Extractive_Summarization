‘ @entity6 problem to have ’ is the usual cliche thrown out by managers when they have a surplus of ego - centric stars to mesh into a team			0
perhaps @entity8 put it better when he said the biggest problem in football management was keeping the players happy - ‘ the players who are n’t in your first 11 , ’ he added			0
and @entity8 never had to deal with the @entity16 squad sizes that @entity17 is managing			2
that said , just how does the @entity18 manager squeeze @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity44 , @entity23 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity27 , who is now fit , into the same team ? he wo n’t , of course , unless he wants to end up like @entity49 who sent out his famous five of attacking players - @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 - for @entity25 in 1994			1
how pretty it looked in august ; @entity49 was sacked in october			0
let ’s take it as a given that @entity17 wants to get @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity23 on to the pitch and work from there			1
that would suggest - and the game at @entity25 backs this up - that his preferred way of playing will be the diamond , with @entity23 behind the front two , requiring @entity27 to play a little deeper and narrower alongside @entity68 in midfield			1
it ’s a role he filled at @entity72 , though with more licence to go forward			0
@entity21 would anchor the midfield leaving @entity45 , as the new boy , and @entity46 to miss out			1
@entity23 has thrived when playing at the point of @entity18 's diamond formation in midfield @entity68 provides @entity18 's midfield with plenty of energy , impetus and hard work @entity21 has dropped back into an anchor role at the base of the midfield diamond and yet @entity46 impressed as an attacking midfielder last season , so if @entity17 wants to revert to him playing behind a lone striker - presumably @entity20 - then @entity22 will be the man forced wide , with @entity23 resuming a wide left role			1
@entity17 claims @entity20 will play where he ’s told but it would be a brave man to play him out wide , given the utter necessity of tracking back in that position			2
@entity96 tried it at @entity98 and gave up			0
@entity68 and @entity21 would anchor in the above formation meaning no place for @entity44 , @entity27 or @entity45			1
@entity46 impressed last season but could make way after a number of summer signings @entity45 comes off the bench to replace @entity20 during the victory at @entity25 but @entity17 is a man whose tactical blueprint is derived from the likes of @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 so a 3 - 4 - 3 formation must also be a possibility			1
that would allow him to play the front three as above and give him a midfield with @entity45 and @entity27 as wide men			2
it looks extraordinarily ambitious and asks a lot of those two defensively			0
but @entity17 is not a man afraid to take risks			2
and we can safely assume , that unlike @entity121 , he will be given time to find the best combination and the right balance			0
@entity125 @entity18 will always be ambitious - @entity19			0

@entity27 has recovered from injury *setback* in *pre-season*
former @entity72 man is one of many new signings at @entity132
@entity17 also brought in @entity20 and @entity45
@entity22 and @entity23 *remain* as *key* figures in side
@entity21 is midfield anchor with @entity68 ahead of him
