by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 02:56 est , 18 december 2012 more than one in ten conservative voters at the last election now backs the @entity3 , according to a poll commissioned by former @entity6 vice chairman @entity5 more than one in ten conservative voters at the last election now backs the @entity3 , but many will return to the fold if the government delivers on immigration , welfare and the deficit , a poll suggests today			1
just a quarter of those considering voting @entity18 name relations with @entity19 as one of the top three issues facing @entity22 , according to the survey commissioned by former @entity6 vice chairman @entity5			1
he warned that the promise of an @entity27 referendum will not be enough to reverse an increase in support for @entity18			1
the poll , based on interviews with more than 20,000 people , suggests that even among those voters who currently back @entity18 , only seven per cent name resolving relations with @entity37 as the single most important issue			1
the survey finds the issue ranks behind economy growth , welfare , immigration and the deficit for this group of voters			2
the poll suggests that @entity18 will do ‘ very well indeed ’ in the @entity48 elections in 2014 , after it finished in second place in 2009 with 16 per cent of the vote			2
a string of recent polls has put @entity18 ahead of the traditional third party , the @entity53			0
but lord @entity5 said many voters viewed the @entity27 polls as seriously as the @entity56			1
he said : ‘ these voters think @entity22 is changing for the worse			0
they are pessimistic , even fearful , and they want someone and something to blame			0
they do not think mainstream politicians are willing or able to keep their promises or change things for the better			0
‘ for voters attracted to @entity18 , complaints about immigration or the @entity27 are often part of a greater dissatisfaction with the way they see things going in @entity22 : they told us that schools ca n’t hold nativity plays any more ; that you ca n’t fly a flag of @entity76 any more ; that you ca n’t call christmas @entity77 any more ; that you wo n’t get social housing unless you ’re an immigrant ; and that you ca n’t speak up about these things because you ’ll be called a racist – but the mainstream political parties , they believe , are too in thrall to the prevailing culture of political correctness to do anything about it			2
‘ for those drawn to it , @entity18 ’s primary attraction is that it will say things that need to be said but others are scared to say			0
’ lord @entity5 said many voters viewed the @entity27 polls as seriously as the @entity56 , which this year featured @entity93 pop twins @entity94 ( pictured ) lord @entity5 said a strong @entity18 performance at the @entity97 elections in 18 months ’ time should not be seen as a harbinger of ‘ electoral doom ’ for the @entity6 in a general election in 2015			1
‘ in our research people compared @entity19 elections to the @entity56 ; some cheerfully said that voting @entity18 in these elections was just a way to “ give @entity19 a slap ” , ’ he said			2
in what will be seen as a warning to @entity109 , who ran @entity112 ’s immigration - focused election campaign in 2005 and is expected to return as an adviser to mr @entity114 in the @entity115 , lord @entity5 insisted that the @entity116 should not employ ‘ dog whistle ’ tactics to try to win back support			1
he said : ‘ ultimately , the battle between @entity18 and the @entity116 is less about ideas , policies , or even values			0
it is a battle between the party of easy answers and the party of tough decisions , ’ he added			0
‘ those who want the latter need to be reassured that those decisions are right , and that they are bearing fruit			0
