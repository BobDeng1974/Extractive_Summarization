by @entity0 @entity2 island hopping has traditionally been the preserve of those willing to jump on ferries to sail between different outposts , but one @entity2 aviation company is hoping to change all that			0
@entity8 is hoping to launch a service as early as next year , allowing tourists to hop between different @entity2 islands by seaplane			1
there are currently just 50 airports across the country 's 6,000 islands , meaning travellers rely on a ferry service to explore the @entity19 , but the airline hopes to create affordable flights and offer a whopping 100 connections by 2016			1
successful : seaplanes are hugely beneficial in other tourist destinations such as @entity25 and the @entity26 making travelling easier : guests might not have to endure long journeys , changeable timetables and seasickness for too much longer the company , which is based in @entity32 and was founded in may 2013 , recently got the green light to build a seaplane waterway at the port of @entity36 on the mainland			2
their next , more ambitious launch , has already been delayed			0
but all being well @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 should be serviceable by air next may			1
@entity39 is also a focus , allowing travellers easier access to locations such as @entity48 castle			2
windsurfing spot @entity49 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , which have amazing beaches , are also going to linked by seaplane			0
it 's hoped the plans will attract more visitors and boost tourism in a country emerging from recession			1
@entity2 ferrys : these large vessels are currently the primary means of transport to and from the islands so beautiful : the stunning @entity69 beach at @entity71 island is surrounded by crystal clear waters boss @entity73 said : ' the creation of a waterways network and development of seaplane transport in @entity2 is now a fact and we will try to cover all destinations			0
' the @entity26 and @entity82 have shown how seaplanes can contribute to the growth of tourism and we have more islands , a longer coastline and are close to large @entity89 tourist markets			0
' the firm currently has a 12 - seater @entity91 and 19 - seat @entity93 amphibious aircraft			0
the seaplanes will not need any costly infrastructure as they are already able to land on water ; a necessity to reach the smaller islands .			1

@entity8 want to connect 100 islands by 2016
@entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 should be serviceable by air next may
planes are able to land on water to visit the *tiniest* of islands
it 's hoped more guests will flock to the country emerging from recession
