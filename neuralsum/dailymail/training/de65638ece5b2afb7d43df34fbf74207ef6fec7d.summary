instant camera film features layers of colours of light			0
these layers sit on top of a black base layer and beneath an image , timing and acid layer			0
when the shot is taken , a small amount of reagent material is rolled onto the film sheet , which reacts with chemicals in the film			0
these chemicals move downward through the layers , dissolving the developer dye so it moves towards the image layer			0
metallic silver areas on each layer , which were exposed to light when the photo was taken , capture the dye so it is distributed throughout the photo , to match the colours of the scene photographed			0
the acid layer in the film reacts with the alkali and opacifiers in the reagent , making the opacifiers become clear , and this is what makes the image appear			0
