tech entrepreneur @entity9 , 38 , and his former competitive gymnast wife @entity10 , 34 , if they complete the grueling feat , will become the first couple to ever successfully make the trip across the mighty @entity15			1

ultimate challenge : @entity9 his wife @entity10 are pictured training for their @entity27 to @entity30 trek across the @entity15 in just a row boat ' it 's going to be uncomfortable			1
we 'll be sleep - deprived and hungry and sore , so it will be easier to cross boundaries that we do n't want to cross , ' @entity16 told @entity36			1
her husband agreed : ' the mental side is going to be the most challenging			1
how we deal with ourselves and with each			2
but these are two people accustomed to pushing boundaries and coming out on top			2

' currently , their focus is on rowing , though neither had any experience with the sport before the decided to make the trip			0
' both of us were looking for a new and difficult adventure that would push our mental and physical capabilities , ' said @entity9			1
' the longest i 've spent rowing was six hours , and that was in a 35 - pound shell , not a heavy boat like @entity9 and @entity10 are going out in , ' said @entity104 of the @entity63 rowing center			1
' but they have gone about their training and preparation in a really disciplined way			0
they were super fit to begin with , but they came here to get the right form			0
they learned and practiced in the heaviest boats we have , ' she said			0
death to sugar : their website @entity122 will track their progress and serves as a place where donors can give money to help with the couple 's pet cause - ending the epidemic of world sugar consumption their water - tight boat and cabin will come stocked with a desalinator that will allow them to safely drink seawater			1

' i do n't think it 's crazy , but it is an aggressive challenge , ' @entity161 of the @entity155 @entity162 told the @entity36			0
' the mental strain is hard to imagine			0
it 's like living locked in your car and you ca n't get out			0
