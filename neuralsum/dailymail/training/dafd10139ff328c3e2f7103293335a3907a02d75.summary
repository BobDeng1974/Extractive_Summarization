women , highly educated , divorced and rich people are more likely to die from assisted suicide , new research has revealed			1
researchers in @entity5 , where assisted suicide is legal , found that of people helped by right - to - die organisations such as @entity9 , around 16 per cent of death certificates did not register an underlying cause			1
they say this indicates that an increasing number of people may simply becoming ' weary of life '			0
of people helped by right - to - die organisations in @entity5 , such as @entity9 ( pictured ) , around 16 per cent of death certificates did not register an underlying cause			1
- suggesting they were ' weary of life ' the research , published online in the @entity23 â€“ that shows assisted suicide is more common in women , the divorced , those living alone , the more educated , those with no religious affiliation , and those from wealthier areas			1
a previous study of suicides by two right - to - die organizations showed that 25 per cent of those assisted had no fatal illness , instead citing ' weariness of life ' as a factor			1
in this study , researchers from the @entity40 looked at anonymous data on 1,301 cases of assisted suicide between 2003 and 2008 , provided by three right - to - die organisations			1
in 84 per cent of cases , the death certificates listed at least one underlying cause of death			1
in the age group , 25 - 64 years the majority had cancer ( 57 per cent ) , followed by diseases of the nervous system ( 21 per cent )			0
eleven people had a mood disorder listed as the first underlying cause , and three had another mental or behavioural disorder			0
religious affiliation appeared to influence whether a person opted for assisted suicide			1
religion was another key factor			0
people of no faith were six times more likely to choose assisted suicide than @entity68			1
( pope @entity69 is pictured ) for all causes , except @entity72 , the percentage of assisted suicides was higher in women than men			0
in the 65 - 94 years age group , cancer was again the most common underlying cause ( 41 per cent ) , followed by circulatory ( 15 per cent ) and diseases of the nervous system ( 11 per cent )			2
thirty people had a mood disorder , and six had another mental or behavioural disorder			0
the rate was also higher in urban compared to rural areas , in wealthier neighbourhoods , and in the @entity89 rather than @entity91 or @entity92 speaking areas of the country			0
younger people who had children were less likely to opt for assisted suicide in younger people , but not older people			1
religion was another key factor			0
people of no faith were six times more likely to choose assisted suicide than @entity68 , the @entity100 reported			1
divorcees and people who live alone are also 50 per cent more likely to choose assisted suicide , researchers found those living alone or divorced were 50 per cent more likely to choose it			1
lead researcher professor @entity109 said : ' the higher rates among the better educated and those living in neighbourhoods of higher socio - economic standing does not support the ' slippery slope ' argument but might reflect inequities in access to assisted suicide			2
on the other hand , we found a higher rate among people living alone and the divorced			0
social isolation and loneliness are well known risk factors for non-assisted suicides and our results suggest that they may also play a role in assisted suicide			2
' also , the observation that women die more frequently by assisted suicide than men is potentially of concern			2
interestingly , though , studies from the @entity133 and @entity134 in the @entity135 reported more men than women among assisted deaths			0
' last year , the @entity139 asked @entity5 to clarify whether and under what conditions individuals not suffering from terminal illnesses should have access to help in ending their lives , suggesting that @entity5 should more precisely regulate assisted dying			0
while euthanasia is prohibited in @entity5 , the penal code states that assisted suicide is legal if no selfish interests are involved			2
assisted suicides in @entity5 involve volunteers working for ' right - to - die ' associations			2
the role of physicians is restricted to assessing the decisional capacity of the person requesting assistance and to prescribing the lethal drug			0
notably , the person requesting assistance does not need to have a terminal illness			0
dr @entity109 added that future deaths in right - to - die clinics must be registered so that suicide trends must be monitored .			2

of people helped by right - to - die organisations such as @entity9 , around 16 per cent of death certificates did not register an underlying cause
people with no religious *affilaition* were six times more likely to opt for assisted suicide than @entity68
divorcees and those who lived alone were each 50 *%* more likely to choose it
