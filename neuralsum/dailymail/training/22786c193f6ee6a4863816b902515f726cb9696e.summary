all he could do was watch			0
@entity5 stood on the @entity6 touchline - grim - faced , hands in pockets and moustache somehow bowed - presumably wondering how it came to this			1
humiliated in the most embarrassing way possible , it is the end for @entity11			1
for six years they have been the most proactive , visionary side in the world but on the eastern coast of @entity17 on wednesday night they lacked cohesion , fight and a basic plan			1
as the whistle was blown on their @entity25 defence , the coach ’s head dropped before he arched back inside having long since accepted that the lights are probably out on his managerial career			0
they have conceded more goals ( seven ) this time around than they did in winning the the last three major competitions over the last six years , and the 14 shots they 've allowed on goal is only three shy of the entire amount four years ago			2
against @entity50 only @entity48 and @entity49 sent more than one shot on goal			1
@entity52 did n't manage any			0
@entity53 lost the ball a staggering 22 times			2
their pass completion percentage was at its lowest since a quarter - final defeat against @entity59 in 2002 , while @entity60 attempted fewer passes than ever before			2
the front four made four challenges between them , the side 's overall tackling success was down by 11 per cent compared to @entity66 and their time in possession is now more passive			0
the list goes on : this was a side happy to stand and stare blankly as they were chastened			0
it means @entity11 are now the third holders in the last four tournaments - following @entity76 ( 2002 ) and @entity77 ( 2010 ) - to be dumped out in the first round			1
the @entity79 were excellent , thoroughly deserving of progressing from @entity80 alongside @entity81 , but the ease in which the champions were dispensed with was difficult viewing			2
so too was their lack of urgency and stomach to coherse themselves out of a hole			0
decisions from the top have been constantly curious and proven as badly wrong from start to finish			0
they have remained fiercely loyal to some – @entity34 in particular – and decided to dump more deserving others			1
@entity98 was unused on the bench			1
meanwhile @entity5 plumped for the castigated goalkeeper and an unfit @entity52			0
@entity34 ’ flapping has cost them the chance to at least take this to the final group game ; hardly surprising given he ’s turned out just twice for @entity107 in @entity108 since january 2013			1
maybe @entity109 was right after all – he saw this two years ago			0
horror : @entity34 has been a walking mistake this tournament and was consoled by @entity48 against @entity50 awful : @entity17 - born @entity52 has been a huge disappointment for @entity11 in the first two games it is n’t just his gaffes that are the problem for @entity11 though			1
is it too straightforward to ponder the legitimacy of a captain having to be comforted by @entity48 after yet another mistake ? what sort of message does that give off ? and what does @entity34 say to his team - mates at half - time , staring down the barrel without the guts to fight on ? their leaders have vanished			1
@entity48 appears to be the sole figure willing to send rockets up behinds , to cajole , to care			1
they lack a man to put it about , mix things up and upset the bodies within the camp that have been engulfed by the sycophancy surrounding their six - year domination			2
@entity143 ’s absence is hitting @entity11 harder than was initially anticipated			1
they are a sorry mess , not even a shadow of former selves , with @entity34 the pin - up and only wearing the armband by design			1
while his international demise is sad to see , it ’s nothing compared to @entity98			1
having to watch @entity153 and @entity154 make a dog ’s dinner of shepherding @entity157 – for a man of his guile – must have been tortuous			0
the pictures of the @entity162 midfielder on the bench were painful			2
@entity153 failed to win a single tackle all night			0
trouble : @entity164 looked more threatening than @entity52 despite struggling for form in recent years is that a captain 's stance ? @entity34 looked bemused in the tunnel before going out for the second half out on their feet : the @entity174 team looked tired in the second half , and were outrun against @entity50 then there is @entity52			1
@entity176 are , for some unbeknown reason , spending £ 32million on a striker whose two shots off target are the only contributions to a dismal week			0
yes , he lacks match practice – much like @entity34 – but if the @entity17 - born forward was deemed sharp enough to start then questions must be asked about what he actually brings			1
his first touch was heavy , body language non-existent and pace laughable			0
twenty - one touches all evening and not a single one in the six - yard box ; @entity164 replaced him in the 64th minute and managed just two fewer			2
there is more than a slight argument for @entity5 repaying some faith in @entity164 , who – while awful at @entity194 - has played his best football at major tournaments			2
eighteen - goal @entity198 missed out on the 23 - man squad and they ’ve gone into it without a striker capable of finding the net			1
and having players going into the tournament in indifferent form , with fitness issues or just a poor season has been right at the heart of their problems			0
that , coupled with the fact that plan b was to continue with @entity214 the like - for - like substitutions in both defeats were bizarre and had no impact on changing the course of the games			2
glum : @entity98 ( centre ) could only watch on as his @entity11 side were utterly humiliated at the @entity6 they ca n't believe it ! @entity174 supporters watched on distraught as they were taught a footballing lesson @entity227 was n’t their eventual undoing , far from it			1
no matter what @entity11 played this summer - 4 - 4 - 2 , 3 - 4 - 3 , 4 - 6 - 0 - they ’d have gone out			1
they were n’t good enough in possession , were disgustingly fragile without it and had no inclination to battle for the cause			0
the shrugs after defeat against @entity81 were testament to that			0
these giants of the game are now growing used to not winning games			0
of @entity162 and @entity107 ’s combined final 20 games of the league season , eight of them ended in draw or defeat			0
even though there were only two players over the age of 30 in their starting xi against @entity50 , the perception is that they are now finished			2
@entity5 - while not ruling out staying in charge – definitely is			0
this is the end , my friend .			0

the world champions lost 2 - 0 against @entity50 at the @entity6
@entity34 was again singled out for *criticism* in goal
@entity98 watched from the bench with @entity48 the only player to visibly urge @entity11 on
they have been eliminated from @entity17 after just two matches
