by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 08:45 est , 22 october 2012 when you are aiming to become the @entity3 , the last thing you wish to see is your campaign crash into the ground			2
sadly for @entity7 , this is precisely what happened on sunday night , when a blimp carrying his campaign message fell from the skies over @entity13 in sunday night			1
luckily nobody was injured in the crash , which was caused by high winds , but is did cause some amusement in a town which generally supports the @entity19			1
' i thought boy , @entity7 really wants us to vote for him			0
' the blimp contained the slogan ' @entity44 ' , and it was flying from @entity45 - the site of today 's third and final debate between @entity21 and @entity7 - to @entity47			1
but five miles from the airport , the blimp came down in the town of @entity34 , @entity30			0
@entity50 quoted @entity52 spokesman capt. @entity51 , who said : ' it experienced some high winds and was having a difficult time and crash landed here in the field just south of @entity58 in @entity34			1
' they were experiencing some problems due to the wind which forced them to crash land here in the field			0
' it came down tail first and then the gondola struck and then rolled to its side as it deflated			0
' he added that the pilot was able to put it down in a field and avoid the nearby houses			0
the deflated airship has now been transported to its intended destination at @entity47			0
on the campaign trail : @entity7 speaks in front of a barn at @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82 message in tatters : the blimp narrowly avoided houses before crashing into a local park @entity7 's face is not the only one plummeting to the ground this week			1
@entity21 leads by a wafer - thin 0.2 per cent nationally in the @entity92 poll of averages			2
tonight is his last chance halt @entity7 â€™s late surge and stave off a re-election defeat after plummeting in the polls after his disastrous first debate performance			2
@entity21 is down seven in the @entity100 tracking poll , down two in the @entity102 poll and has seen his leads in @entity13 and @entity104 disappear - and his @entity106 advantage whittled down to almost nothing			0
journey on foot : workers remove the blimp to the side of the park after it deflated , and it was eventually moved to an airport the latest @entity50 / @entity116 poll , which had @entity21 three points ahead before the debates , now puts the two candidates dead level on 47 points each among likely voters with six per cent undecided			2
although most pundits and post-debate polls have @entity21 the advantage over @entity7 following the second debate , he has seen no improvement in the polls and the momentum appears to remain with the @entity132 nominee			1
the final presidential debate will focus on foreign policy - a traditional @entity132 strength that should be an advantage for @entity21 this time around because of the demise of @entity137 last may and the end of the @entity140 war			1
campaigning for victory : @entity7 during the second presidential debate at @entity143 in @entity144 last week			0
