' on the day before we were due to go out on holiday he seemed fine and was talking of how much we were looking forward to it			2
but the following morning he woke complaining a headache and was joking that he hoped it would not ruin the holiday			1
' he said " i hope i do n't feel like this on the plane "			0
' but at about 8am he said he was feeling a lot worse and said he could n't move			0
' he was screaming out in pain then he stopped being able to talk so we called an ambulance			0
then it was just a whirlwind and he had the stroke			0
' even though he had n't been able to talk again , he started laughing and was able to move part of his arms and was aware of what was going on around him			0
we thought he was going to get better			0
' i went with him in the ambulance and then his speech went in the ambulance and he never spoke again			0
' it was heartbreaking watching him go like that and i could n't take it in			0
i was with him every day			0

' @entity3 , a lifelong @entity132 fan , played for @entity134 's side at 12 before progressing to the seniors at 16			1
he also played for another amateur squad @entity136 and was captain for a local pub team			0
he regularly featured in local newspaper sports reports about his goal scoring feats and often notched up to five goals in a single game and helped win several trophies			2
after hit a winning trail in the @entity148 and @entity146 local newspaper report began : ' there 's only one @entity3			1
' while he was in hospital , the skipper 's teammates hung banners urging him to get better - but he died with his grirfriend and the rest of his family at his bedside @entity3 's mother @entity158 told the inquest that her son had suffered from headaches previously - and six weeks prior to the stroke had come home from football ' feeling sickly '			1
an ambulance was called but she told the inquest that the headache had passed and he was feeling better			2
tragedy struck last august after he was appointed skipper at @entity136			0
he suffered a blood clot in a vital artery which had prevented blood flow to the brain			1
his team mates hung banners in the ward by team - mates saying : ' we need our skipper back ' , but he died in october at the @entity180			2
the @entity180 hearing was told there was no missed opportunity to help @entity3 and nothing could have been done differently in his treatment			1
mrs @entity158 told the inquest : ' we got eight weeks with him , it was a shock and we were told we needed to pray for a miracle			2
' @entity3 , who began playing football for @entity190 when he was 12 , played centre forward three or four times a week after examination of the brain , a neuropathologist concluded that there had been a blood clot in the brain that could have been caused by high blood pressure - or trauma such as whiplash or a sudden jerk causing the vessel to break			1
the pathologist said : ' getting a clot at that young age is not a common phenomenon			2
' after the inquest @entity3 's father @entity111 said : ' you do n't expect to outlive your child			1
' he was a talented footballer and played centre forward , playing three or four times a week			1
his team will be holding tribute matches to him each year in his memory			0
' @entity10 manager @entity216 said : ' i am shocked and deeply upset by the death of @entity3			1
he loved his football , he was quick with a good eye for goal			0
' @entity3 was fully committed be it a training game or a fully fledged official game			1
his commitment , his enthusiasm , his determination could never be questioned			0
' @entity3 's legacy will always remain with me and @entity9			1
there is a big void left that will never be filled			0
' @entity3 will be a sad loss to not only his close family but his football family			1
' coroner @entity234 said : ' it is unbelievable that somebody who was so fit and healthy and an active sportsman that something could happen that is so catastrophic			0
' it is almost unbelievable and one of the things that my job tells me is that you can take nothing for granted in life			0
you do n't know what is around the corner and everyday is precious			0
' as a parent myself i ca n't begin to imagine the trauma you and the family have had , seeing @entity3 this very fit , active young man reduced to this , in circumstances where doctors are unable to do anything			1
' the blood clot in @entity3 's brain could have been caused by high blood pressure - or trauma such as whiplash or a sudden jerk causing a blood vessel to break			1
one theory is that every time the ball hits the head , the blood vessel walls become less stiff and weakens so they expand , like a garden hose that becomes fatter as it ages			2
@entity274 published this week suggests that repeated , sub-concussive hits to the head are dangerous and are also linked to neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis later in life			0
scientists from the @entity281 say that the brain degeneration observed among professional football players may be due to something in their immune system spiralling out of control			2
this could be because it damages the blood - brain barrier - a ' gate ' between the brain and bloodstream			1
when the barrier is working properly , it holds in proteins and molecules that bathe the brain and protect it from foreign substances			2
with blows to the head , however , the barrier opens slightly and allows some proteins to leak into the bloodstream and possibly attack the brain			0
and just last week , researchers at the @entity307 warned that heading a football could cause brain damage			0
they said that a header is classed as a ' minor sub-concussive blow ' and have found that young people who play football are less able to perform tasks requiring basic thinking skills than those who avoid the game .			0
