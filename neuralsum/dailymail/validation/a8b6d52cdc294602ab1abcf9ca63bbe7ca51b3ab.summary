@entity0 must have rung in the @entity1 in some style			0
the @entity4 striker has been a transformed player since 2014 ticked over into 2015 and just ca n't stop scoring			0
hardly prolific in the first - half of the season , with just one goal to his credit , the @entity5 is now @entity10 's hottest striker following a sensational run of form			2
@entity0 's double in @entity4 's thrilling 5 - 3 comeback win over @entity15 on sunday took his 2015 tally to 13 goals in eight outings			1
@entity0 celebrates yet another goal - this time in @entity4 's 5 - 3 win at @entity15 on sunday the tall @entity5 striker jumps for joy after scoring for @entity4 against @entity23 last weekend january 30 - two goals @entity4 4 @entity25 1 february 7 - one goal @entity4 3 @entity27 0 february 14 - four goals @entity29 4 @entity4 5 february 19 - two goals @entity4 2 @entity31 0 february 22 - two goals @entity4 2 @entity23 1 march 1 - two goals @entity15 3 @entity4 5 his total is second only to @entity38 's @entity37 star @entity36 , who has 15 goals in 14 matches since the beginning of january			1
but arguably @entity0 's current form is more impressive , given that the @entity43 only resumed on january 30 following its winter break			2
having scored against @entity45 in @entity4 's last fixture before the winter pause , @entity0 picked up where he 'd left off with two against league leaders @entity25 on january 30			1
he then found the net in the home win over @entity27 on february 7 , before scoring four in a remarkable 5 - 4 win at @entity29 a week later			1
the run has continued , with @entity0 scoring two goals in each of @entity4 's matches with @entity31 , @entity23 and @entity15 in the last fortnight			1
the 25 - year - old 's prolific form has pretty much sealed @entity4 a place in next season 's @entity59 - though they are eight points behind runaway leaders @entity25 , they have a 10 - point cushion from third - placed @entity64			2
they are also through to a last 16 @entity66 tie with @entity68 giants @entity67			1
@entity0 's form has also stolen the thunder of @entity71 , who arrived at the @entity72 from @entity73 on deadline day for a fee of £ 22m			0
' things keep going , and they 're going well , ' said @entity0 after his brace in @entity15			2
' every week i 'm here saying that [ the goals ] will stop again , but i just keep going and we 'll see where i am in the end			0
' @entity0 's form has ensured @entity4 are on course for a @entity59 place @entity0 celebrates after scoring in @entity4 's dramatic 5 - 3 win at @entity15 on sunday it has n't always been so good for @entity0			1
this is his third season in the @entity43 and by some way his best - he scored 12 in 33 matches in his first season at @entity4 , then five in 15 last year			1
the 6ft 5in target man has prospered from an effective link up with the former @entity73 man @entity92 , who has contributed six assists since the @entity43 resumed in january			0
born in the @entity5 city of @entity96 , @entity0 's first professional clubs were @entity97 and @entity98 , where 15 goals during the 2009 - 10 season led to rumours of a move to @entity103			1
in the end , the 20 - year - old moved elsewhere in the @entity106 to @entity107 and realised his potential with two prolific seasons			0
in 2011 - 12 , he scored a remarkable 38 goals in 39 matches in @entity5 league and cup , finishing as the country 's top goalscorer			1
@entity0 salutes the crowd at the @entity72 after scoring in the win over @entity23 applying a cool finish to score against @entity23 during the recent @entity43 encounter inevitably , there was interest from the @entity122 , with @entity0 turning down a £ 7m move to @entity124 at the time			2
instead he moved to the @entity43 and @entity4 , making an immediate impact with a stoppage time winner away to @entity128 on his debut			0
aside from that , his winner at defending champions @entity133 last season was also memorable			0
but it is this season that has seen @entity0 elevate his game to another level			0
having started the campaign as @entity4 's third - choice striker , he is now indispensible			0
with his eye for goal , clinical finishing , aerial prowess and ability to hold the ball up , @entity0 has matured into the complete package , raising plenty of eyebrows throughout the football world .			0

@entity0 has 13 goals in eight matches since the start of 2015
his strikes have set @entity4 on course for the @entity59
@entity5 scored twice in sunday 's dramatic 5 - 3 win over @entity15
he scored four in recent 5 - 4 @entity43 win at @entity29
@entity4 are also into last 16 of @entity66 and face @entity67
