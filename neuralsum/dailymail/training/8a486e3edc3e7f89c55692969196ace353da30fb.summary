@entity0 has shown off the first video taken with its ' @entity3 ' techno - glasses - hi - tech specs that ' layer ' computer information over the world			1
the glasses also have a camera built into the arm - and the glasses are starting to be seen increasingly outside the @entity0 offices , with co-founders @entity12 and @entity14 both wearing the techno - specs at public events			1
' this one makes us a little queasy , but our prototype nailed what it 's like to be on a trampoline , ' says @entity0 via - what else ? - the official @entity3 home page			1
' we ¿ d love to hear about the types of moments you 'd capture if you didn ¿ t have to wait to pull out a camera or your phone , ' says the team the glasses record video via computer components build into the arms @entity37 are now testing the prototypes ' in the wild ' @entity0 employees show off the glasses at a race in @entity43 @entity0 's glasses in action : @entity0 has shown off a picture taken with its ' @entity3 ' techno - glasses - hi - tech glasses that ' layer ' computer information over the world ' we ’d love to hear about the types of moments you 'd capture if you did n’t have to wait to pull out a camera or your phone , ' says the team			1
the prototypes are also being tested ' in the wild ' by @entity0 co-founder @entity14 , who was pictured weariing a pair of the glasses			1
the wraparound glasses feature a miniature display that sits above one eye , allowing users to surf the internet , make video calls , listen to music and update the diary without lifting a finger			0
' we announced @entity3 in part to let our team start testing prototypes outside the office , ' says the @entity3 team , via its @entity77 page			0
the screen is controlled by voice and by tilting your head , so one catch may be a few funny looks in the street			0
a prototype is being tweaked and tested in public by the company ’s employees before it goes on sale			0
the technology is known as ‘ wearable computing ’ and is expected to launch a new generation of gadgets which display a layer of information over everything the wearer sees – bringing together the search engine , gps tracking , a phone and a camera			1
' we announced @entity3 in part to let our team start testing prototypes outside the office , ' says the @entity3 team , via its @entity77 page the wraparound glasses feature a miniature display that sits above one eye , allowing users to surf the internet , make video calls , listen to music and update the diary without lifting a finger the @entity117 glasses also layer information such as gps and emails over the ' real ' world the demo shows off @entity122 being ' added ' to the real world - providing real - time directions from your current location in demonstrations , the glasses are mainly voice - controlled , using voice commands to bring up contacts , send emails and search the glasses appear to run a variant of the @entity117 operating system , using the same microphone icon and other recognisable parts of @entity0 's mobile os the demo shows emails and other information ' layered ' into a view of the world via screens in the glasses ' we think technology should work for you — to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you do n’t , ' says @entity0			1
the glasses appear to run a variant of the @entity117 operating system , using the same microphone icon and other recognisable parts of @entity0 's mobile os. the glasses layer information ' over ' the world , and offer directions - as well as allowing users to ' locate ' one another in the real world , as with @entity0 's current @entity162 system			1
' a group of us from @entity165 started @entity3 to build this kind of technology , one that helps you explore and share your world , putting you back in the moment , ' says @entity0			2
checked in : the @entity0 device will alert the user if friends are located in the neighborhood the demonstration shows off a weather forecast layered over a view of the world tip : @entity0 's glasses would provide practical alerts to direct a user of where to go ... or not go ' we ’re sharing this information now because we want to start a conversation and learn from your valuable input			1
so we took a few design photos to show what this technology could look like and created a video to demonstrate what it might enable you to do			0
' various leaks had hinted that @entity0 wanted to move into wearable computing			0
' many of the features - voice commands , embedded camera , @entity122 integration - have been previously rumored , but it ’s compelling to actually see them in action			0
whether they will work quite as well in reality is , so far , uncertain , ' says @entity208			0
no release date has been confirmed for the glasses - nor has @entity0 explained exactly how the glasses work			2
the glasses also allow users to record and share videos from a built - in camera , just like on @entity216 the world is just an eyeball away : models demonstrate how the goggles look in practice ' @entity165 ' is where the search giant 's scientists work on wild , out - there ideas			1
' @entity0 has always invested in speculative r&d projects - it 's part of our dna , ' said a spokesperson when the first news of the lab leaked			2
' while the possibilities are incredibly exciting , the sums involved are very small by comparison to the investments we make in our core businesses			0
in terms of details , we do n't comment on speculation			0
' the lab is reportedly located in @entity0 's @entity244 , @entity246 headquarters - known as ' the @entity247 '			1
engineers are free to work on projects such as connected fridges that order groceries when they run low - or even tableware that can connect to social networks			0
other @entity0 engineers have reportedly researched ideas as far - out as elevators to space			2
@entity0 co-founder @entity14 is reportedly deeply involved in the lab. his business card is said to be simply a piece of silvery metal decorated with the letter @entity263 @entity14 , a robot enthusiast , once attended a conference via a robot with a screen showing his face			0
it 's not unusual for tech companies to have ' ideas labs ' hidden away from their ordinary workers - at @entity278 , for instance , @entity272 's design lab where devices such as @entity274 are perfected , is guarded as if it was a weapons facility .			2

glasses have built - in camera , gps and offer email and web searches on surface of glasses
prototypes now being tested outside @entity0 's offices
