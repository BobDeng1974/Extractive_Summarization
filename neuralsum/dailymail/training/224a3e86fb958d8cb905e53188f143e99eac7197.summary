by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 08:21 est , 18 july 2012 the @entity1 may cut interest rates to below its current record low of 0.5 % in the coming months to try to revive @entity5 's depressed economy			1
members of the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) opted to pump more emergency cash into the economy earlier this month , but not before discussing in more detail the possibility of a first cut in rates since march 2009 , it was revealed today			2
detailed minutes show while they ultimately opted to increase its quantitative easing ( @entity20 ) programme to £ 375 billion , its members agreed to consider cutting interest rates below 0.5 %			1
this would good news for millions of people with variable mortgages but a bitter blow for even more savers and pensioners			0
struggling : the @entity1 will pump a further 50 billion pounds into the @entity5 economy to try to improve the nation 's slumping economy but may also cut interest rates this year @entity32 boss @entity31 has already urged the bank to lower its base rate and use more quantitative easing to help the @entity5 weather the eurozone debt crisis			1
the minutes of the @entity7 ’s july meeting , released today , said the impact of the recently unveiled funding for lending scheme might ' alter ' the committee ’s assessment of such a rate reduction			1
the £ 80 billion funding for lending scheme was launched last friday by the @entity1 and the @entity46 in a bid to free up the logjam in credit hitting the economy , by offering banks cheap finance on the condition they pass it on to borrowers			0
under the scheme , @entity5 banks are being offered funding at low interest rates over a four - year period - but it will be directly linked to bank lending performance to encourage lenders to increase loan availability and reduce rates			2
@entity64 , chief @entity5 economist at @entity65 , said : ' members signalled that a rate cut was still possible further ahead , although only after the effects of the funding for lending scheme become apparent			0
' the minutes also show the @entity1 voted unanimously to hold rates at 0.5 % this month , while seven members backed the @entity20 boost and two - @entity74 and @entity75 - voted to hold the stock at £ 325 billion the economy is in a double - dip recession after contracting by 0.3 % in the first quarter of 2012 and declining 0.4 % in the final three months of last year			1
meanwhile , inflation has pulled back from 5.2 % last september as the impact of the @entity83 hike fades and energy and commodity prices fall			0
the near - term picture for growth is “ somewhat weaker ” than the @entity1 ’s assessment last may , the @entity1 ’s minutes added , and the @entity5 is now potentially facing a period of two years where there has been ' little or no economic growth '			2
survey data continued to weaken in the month before the meeting , the @entity7 said , while there were increasing signs that the threat of the eurozone crisis was hitting @entity5 growth			0
the minutes added : ' information during the month suggested export prospects had weakened , which would further impede the @entity5 economy ’s rebalancing away from domestic demand towards net exports			0
# the minutes said the committee had considered the case for a cut to interest rates at its previous meeting in june - but added that such a move had drawbacks that made it ' less attractive ' than a @entity20 boost			1
but the committee said it would ' review this option ' when the impact of the funding for lending scheme was more apparent , although this was unlikely to be for several months .			0
