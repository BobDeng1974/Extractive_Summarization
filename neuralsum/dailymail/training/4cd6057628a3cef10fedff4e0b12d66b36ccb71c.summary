@entity5 , who made £ 10,000 a week selling legal highs , drug paraphernalia and event tickets at his shop , @entity34 , in @entity35 , was jailed for 11 years			1
depraved attack : @entity5 , from @entity35 , had told his victim they were going to a concert police described him as a ‘ sexual predator ’ who tried to impress women by ‘ flashing cash ’ and bragging of his luxury @entity47 yacht			1
and they fear it is ‘ highly likely ’ he attacked many others in a similar manner , luring them with the promise of concert tickets			0
after his sentencing , his victim said : ‘ he is a vile human being			0
i hope he dies in prison so he can not hurt anyone else			0
’ a court heard how @entity5 , who lived in a luxury £ 250,000 @entity35 apartment with his wife , had picked the young woman up from her home in the city to travel to a concert given by @entity70 band			1
once in the car he gave her a capsule and a can of ‘ @entity74 ’ – an @entity76 , high - alcohol energy drink – to wash it down			2
the capsule was later found to be the @entity79 substance @entity80 , a stimulant that can trigger epileptic seizures and fits			2
the drugs left the woman with little memory of the car journey to the hotel near @entity9			2
they caused her to suffer seizures and she had no sense of her surroundings as @entity5 pulled up at the hotel			1
the @entity93 footage shows @entity5 wheeling her towards a lift and then to the room where he carried out the nine - hour assault			1
many of the details of what he did to her while she was incapacitated – and the injuries she suffered – are too horrific to report			0
@entity5 told staff at the hotel that his ' girlfriend ' was drunk and disabled before he borrowed a wheelchair aside from a brief memory of a clock that read ‘ 3.48 ’ and a feeling that she was ‘ contorted ’ the woman , who had regarded @entity5 as a friend , had no memory of what happened , @entity106 heard			1
she woke confused , with @entity5 telling her they had engaged in a night of consensual sex , the jury was told			1
on the way home , he told her he was glad she did not ‘ feel weird ’ about it , adding that some girls ‘ might cry rape ’			2

’ she recalled how she felt ‘ sick and confused ’ as she sat in the passenger seat of his car on the way home			0

his victim , who can not be named for legal reasons , collapsed in court while giving her evidence and still suffers from nightmares she said : ‘ i would urge anyone in my situation to be brave , come forward and speak out			0
’ superintendent @entity153 said the crime was a ‘ cruel and cynical abuse ’ of the victim ’s trust			0
he added : ‘ [ @entity158 ] used his shop and concert ticket business to befriend young people , often at vulnerable times in their lives … the level of planning involved , his behaviour towards his victim and his casual demeanour afterwards lead us to believe he has done this before			2
’ jailed : @entity5 is now serving 11 years , while his @entity35 ' head ' shop is under new management the shop owned by rapist @entity5 was one of hundreds of similar outlets which have sprung up on high streets in recent years			1

when @entity158 was questioned by local press in 2010 about the potentially lethal drugs he said : ‘ do i feel bad about selling legal products to adults ? ‘ no , no more than i would selling cream cakes or pies to a fat person , selling alcohol to an alcoholic , selling cigs to someone with cancer			0
