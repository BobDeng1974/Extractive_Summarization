by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 19:01 est , 26 march 2013 families who dodged the rain for long enough to take a swim in the sea last summer were more likely to catch a bug and fall sick			0
more than one in 20 popular beaches failed to meet even the minimum water quality standards set by the @entity8 , according to research published today			1
the list of 42 failures , which is 17 more than last year , includes several beaches at some of the @entity15 ’s most famous resorts such as @entity16 and @entity17			1
no good : popular seaside holiday destination @entity16 in @entity19 was among the beaches who failed @entity8 rules mean that if these beaches are not cleaned up they will be required to put up danger signs , warning people not to swim , from 2016 onwards			2
household water bills have soared in recent decades to raise billions of pounds to treat and clean - up sewage released into rivers and the sea			2
however , relentless rain and flooding during the wettest summer in 100 years led to an increase in the amount of bacteria and viruses ending up in bathing waters			0
this type of pollution can originate from farmland and urban run - off , storm waters , misconnected plumbing , septic tanks and dog faeces			0
health risk : several @entity15 beaches , including @entity17 in @entity47 , did not meet the minimum water quality standard set by the @entity8 danger : @entity50 at @entity51 on the @entity53 coast was not judged clean and safe by the @entity54 bad business : for holiday destinations such as @entity58 at the south @entity53 resort of @entity58 , the water quality failures may lower visitors numbers further this summer for swimmers , there is a risk of going home with an ear , nose or throat infection , or even gastroenteritis			1
@entity16 , @entity19 @entity17 , @entity69 @entity70 at @entity51 , @entity58 , @entity71 , all in @entity53 @entity72 and @entity73 , @entity74 @entity75 at @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity78 @entity79 at @entity80 , @entity81 @entity82 , @entity83 @entity84 , @entity85 teams from the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) took water samples from some 754 officially designated bathing beaches last summer			1
the number with excellent water quality fell by 113 to 403			1
the remaining 351 failed to achieve the highest rating with 42 missing even the minimum safe standard			0
among the high profile failures were some of the beaches in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity51 , @entity80 , @entity76 , @entity73 , @entity82 , and @entity77 , in @entity78			1
the findings are a blow to the resorts , which are already struggling because of a cost of living squeeze that means many people are staying at home			0
however , not all is lost , for the same study was generally able to identify beaches within a short distance that were clean and safe			0
underperformed : the 42 failing @entity8 beaches included several in the @entity15 , such as @entity76 beach in @entity78 the failing beaches were spread across @entity15 , going as far north as @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity108 @entity109 , @entity110 , called for improved monitoring of sewer overflows and urgent action to reduce pollution from farms and populated areas			1
‘ we have recommended fewer beaches in every @entity120 region and in @entity69 and @entity108			2
in @entity120 , the north west and south west were hit particularly hard , with the fewest number of recommended beaches for at least a decade			0
‘ action must be taken now			0
with stricter bathing water standards from 2015 and summers that appear to be getting wetter , the iconic image of people bathing off golden beaches could be at serious risk			2

more than one in 20 beaches fail to meet minimum water quality standards
other failing beaches include @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity79 at @entity80 and @entity17 in @entity69
