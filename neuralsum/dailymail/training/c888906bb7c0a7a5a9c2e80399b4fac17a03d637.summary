by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:44 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 12:10 est , 24 january 2014 @entity5 workers risk becoming ‘ unemployable ’ because @entity7 red tape means foreign firms will take their business elsewhere , @entity3 warned today			1
the prime minister launched a sustained attack on @entity12 , claiming @entity13 fear if they do not produce more rules and regulations they are ‘ not doing their job ’			1
he urged global firms to bring jobs back to @entity5 , but warned that ‘ complex and overwritten directives ’ impose such heavy burdens on business that those looking to relocate will opt for countries outside the @entity7			1
warning : @entity3 launched a push to attract more customers to bring jobs back to @entity5 but warned they would be deterred by excessive @entity7 regulations speaking at the @entity29 in @entity30 , mr @entity3 launched a drive to reverse the trend of ‘ offshoring ’ , which has seen thousands of @entity5 jobs shifted to low - cost countries in the @entity36 over recent years			1
he argued that cheap energy from shale gas and less red tape could be key to attracting firms to move posts back to the @entity5			1
he said it was wrong to write - off western countries told they can not compete with cheap labour overseas , but warned the @entity7 it will prevent jobs returning to the continent if it imposed excessive and unnecessary rules			2
progress had been made in curbing the impact of @entity12 but ‘ the fight is not yet won ’ , mr @entity3 said			0
he added : ‘ there are still people who think that the key to success is ever greater social protections and more regulations			0
‘ some in the @entity58 seem to think that if they ’re not producing new regulations they ’re somehow not doing their job and that removing existing regulations is somehow an act of self - harm , while many in the @entity64 are tempted to gold plate every piece of legislation			2
‘ let ’s be clear			0
we do n’t protect workers by piling on the regulations and directives to such an extent that they become unemployable			1
‘ we have to maintain the flexibility for companies to grow and expand			2
‘ incredibly complex and overwritten directives that take this flexibility away , that make life difficult for temporary workers , or that stop firms moving people between plants just mean that companies who want to re-shore will re-shore somewhere else			1
’ the prime minister yesterday visited the headquarters of ventilation manufacturer , @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90 which has recently created 26 new jobs by moving production back to the @entity5 from @entity93 he also issued a warning to @entity12 not to stand in the way of @entity5 exploiting its reserves of shale gas through the controversial practice of fracking			1
the @entity100 said the prospect of developing ‘ cheap and predictable ’ energy sources could help to attract back to the @entity104 jobs which had been ‘ off - shored ’ to the rising economic powers of @entity106			2
but he warned that the opportunities presented by shale gas - which had helped transform the @entity109 economy - could be undermined if the @entity7 sought to impose unnecessary new regulations			0
‘ to relocate in @entity104 , businesses will be encouraged by cheap and predictable sources of energy , ’ he said			0
‘ we should be clear that if the @entity7 or its member states impose burdensome , unjustified or premature regulatory burdens on shale gas exploration in @entity104 investors will quickly head elsewhere			0
‘ @entity119 will still be plentifully produced , but @entity104 will be dry			0
’ mr @entity3 also warned that @entity5 could miss out on the benefits of fracking if @entity104 legislation failed to keep pace with the rest of the world according to @entity128 figures , some 1,500 manufacturing jobs have already come back to the @entity5 since 2011			1
today ministers launched a new service called @entity131 @entity5 to help firms which want to do the same			1
mr @entity3 admitted that companies will still move production facilities to countries like @entity136 and @entity93 but he insisted that the @entity137 should not be ‘ written off ’			0
citing recent research which found that one in 10 small and medium - sized businesses have brought production back to the @entity5 over the last year - twice as many as have sent it abroad - he will said that reshoring could become ‘ a fresh driver of growth in @entity104 ’ and @entity5 should take advantage of the trend			1
he added : ‘ for years the @entity137 has been written off			0
people say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline			0
they say we ca n't make anything any more			0
‘ whether it 's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines , the end point is the same dystopian vision - the @entity36 wins while the @entity137 loses ; and the workers lose while the machines win			2
i do n't believe it has to be this way			0

prime minister says @entity13 think producing more rules is ' their job '
insists *draconian* rules designed to protect workers will deter companies
tries to *persuade* firms to reverse trend of taking @entity5 jobs offshore
