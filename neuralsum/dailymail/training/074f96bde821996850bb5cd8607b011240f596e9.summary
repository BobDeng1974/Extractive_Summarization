@entity0 has escaped the @entity2 axe after agreeing to produce a more adventurous team true to the attacking principles of the club			1
under - pressure @entity0 was summoned to a meeting with the board yesterday and emerged with his job after accepting certain objectives , including a change of philosophy and a top - 10 finish			1
the 59 - year - old will have a budget of £ 20million for signings — although the board will become more actively involved in the scouting and recruitment process			1
scroll down for the full @entity2 statement staying put : many had expected @entity0 to be sacked after a disappointing season stand by your man : @entity2 owners @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) met with @entity0 on tuesday along with vice-chairman @entity28 ( centre ) he has agreed to add to his staff an ‘ attacking coach ’ , someone who will have responsibilities for creating a more cavalier and entertaining side , and will also be expected to develop more youngsters from the @entity2 academy			1
despite fierce opposition from supporters , joint - chairmen @entity27 and @entity26 have stayed loyal to @entity0 , who they appointed three years ago and who has a year left on his contract			2
in a poll of more than 12,000 @entity2 fans this month , less than a quarter said they wanted to keep the manager who led them back to the @entity49 in his first season and has kept the club up ever since , finishing 13th last season			1
there were protests at @entity55 last season against the direct style of play and @entity0 was even booed in victory			1
in a statement , the co-owners stressed they had not ignored the feelings of supporters			0
‘ we have a very clear vision of how we want @entity2 to operate under our joint ownership , ’ said @entity27 and @entity63			2
‘ although not everybody understands the @entity67 , we do and we respect it as we have been supporters all our lives			0
‘ we believe this is about a philosophy that is not just about the style of play , but the whole ethos that surrounds the club			2
‘ @entity0 was asked to give us a detailed presentation on his vision for next season and during this he assured us he can deliver that ethos to @entity2 and we have agreed to support him with the resources that he needs			1
‘ we have mapped out a way forward with him that will ensure our much - deserving fans have more to cheer about next season			2
‘ we should also stress , though , that while improvements do need to be made , @entity0 deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing promotion in his first year and two respectable @entity49 finishes in the two years thereafter			2
’ rare win : @entity86 ( right ) and @entity87 celebrate as @entity2 beat @entity88 shining light : @entity90 was one of few players to emerge from the season with his head held high @entity0 was also applauded in the statement for his work with @entity90 , @entity87 and @entity96 and the team ’s defensive solidity			1
it is his expertise at avoiding relegation which is his greatest asset to the club			0
@entity0 ’s record is so good that his presence virtually guarantees survival			2
at least it does if he is allowed to play his way			0
whether his teams can be equally resilient while playing more expansive and attractive football remains to be seen			0
a similar clash of ideologies was at the heart of @entity114 ’s decision to part company with @entity116			0
@entity114 finished ninth , but @entity116 won @entity117 for rescuing @entity118 from the drop			0
@entity27 and @entity63 have clearly wavered over this decision and put out feelers on potential successors but the decisive factor seems to have been that they were unsure about securing a more reliable option than @entity0 at this moment			2
@entity2 can confirm that manager @entity0 will lead the club into the 2014 - 15 @entity49 season after constructive talks with the club 's board			1
the board and @entity0 have held lengthy and detailed discussions on the club 's direction , values and philosophy and a positive way forward for next season has been agreed			1
after listening to feedback from supporters , the board have insisted on improvements to the set - up of the playing and backroom staff to ensure the team provides more entertainment next season			1
the manager has agreed to recruit a new attacking coach to complement the existing coaching set - up as well as an overhaul of the club 's scouting and recruitment operation that will see the board have a greater involvement in the players who are signed , as the board will once again be investing considerable funds into the club this summer			1
the club have made clear that they want to see progression on the pitch and at least a top - 10 finish as a result			0
@entity2 joint - chairmen @entity27 and @entity26 said : ' we have a very clear vision of how we want @entity2 to operate under our joint ownership			2

' we should also stress , though , that while improvements do need to be made , @entity0 deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing promotion in his first year and two respectable @entity49 finishes in the two years thereafter			0
' we have also seen the likes of @entity90 , @entity87 and @entity96 all make huge progress under his management , which in turn contributed to our impressive record of 14 clean sheets last season			0
' the truly historic opportunity of a move to the @entity198 in 2016 forms a major part of our five - year strategy to take this club forward and , while we have a duty to make sure we stay in the @entity49 , we also want to make sure the performances on the pitch will befit a team playing in such a world - renowned stadium			0
' we are absolutely committed to taking @entity2 to new heights and we want to see the club continue on an upward trajectory next season			1
the 2014 - 15 campaign is crucial to our future and we are confident that @entity0 has the passion , experience and determination to make sure it is a success			0
' @entity2 manager @entity0 said : ' i look forward to taking the club forward and improving the squad for next season to try and achieve the plans we have set out in our very productive meeting last week			1

’ for @entity0 , it is a muted victory			0
he remains at the helm , with his existing backroom team intact — even if he has been chastened and his powers reduced — and has the opportunity to prove what he believes : that his methods are adaptable and capable of producing attractive football at an elite level			0
‘ i look forward to taking the club forward and improving the squad for next season to try to achieve the plans set out in our very productive meeting last week , ’ said the @entity2 manager .			1
