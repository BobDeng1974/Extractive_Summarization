by @entity0 published : 02:56 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 3 june 2013 we 're already worried about our flabby stomachs , our wobbly bottoms and our bingo wings			0
but there 's always room for one more thing to fret over ... the latest area women are concerned about is the upper torso - and one @entity11 clinic is targeting our insecurities , offering ' bra strap liposuction ' which claims to banish back fat in just three hours			1
piqued interest from women hoping to simultaneously tone up arms , underarms and upper back areas all at the same has led to the @entity20 in @entity21 launching a new microliposuction procedure - costing at least £ 2,600			1
there is a new area in particular that more women than ever before are concerned about : the upper torso the procedure involves mapping out areas around the upper arms , underneath the arms and around the patient 's upper back where the bra straps sit , in order to pinpoint tiny pockets where unwanted fat is located			1
these areas are then sculpted using @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , delivered under local anaesthetic			0
this process - which lasts between two and three hours and starts from £ 2,600 - involves a very diluted local anaesthesia being injected into targeted areas of fat , and then gently removing the fat using micro cannulas , 3mm in diameter			1
@entity39 involves a very diluted local anaesthesia being injected into fat , and then gently removing it the @entity20 have clinics nationwide where they offer @entity48 - especially around the bra strap the clinic treated twice the number of patients for @entity54 procedures in 2012 as it did in 2010			1
in this time , dr @entity55 , cosmetic doctor at the clinic , has seen a surge in numbers of women requesting more than one area to be treated , rather than women simply requesting their arms , back or flanks to be targeted			0
by targeting multiple areas of the upper body at a time , the patient 's ' problem areas ' are delicately shaped , reducing overhang and providing women with a more slim - line upper body shape			1
the procedure is delivered by @entity72 , the only doctor in @entity73 trained in the @entity38 procure			2
dr @entity55 said : ' when a patient comes to me with a desire to target the upper body , it is important that i take a step back and focus not only on that one specific area , but on the surrounding areas as well			2
it is not enough to target solely the upper arms ; instead i take into consideration how a patient 's body will appear when clothed and where the patient 's underwear will sit			2
' it is also important that i am able to achieve the desired result without the patient having to undergo a surgical procedure under general anaesthetic			2
instead , @entity54 to the bra strap area allows the patient to depart from treatment and return to their day to day routine almost immediately			1
' the £ 10 @entity99 is sold in 50 @entity101 's stores nationwide , ranging sizes 34 - 38 @entity103 and @entity104 @entity21 clinic @entity106 saw a 240 per cent rise in demand for their new fat freezing treatment as girls try to achieve a thigh gap , @entity105 reported in february			1
their treatment @entity115 , a non-invasive treatment that targets stubborn areas of fat , has previously been popular for fat reduction on the lower stomach , but since the thigh - gap trend emerged they found a surge in the number of women getting treatment on their inner thighs			1
it works by attaching a vacuum - like device on the stubborn area of fat - in this case the inner thigh - the head then gently sucks the fat , warms the skin up and then freezes it to minus 10 degrees @entity135			2
the frozen fat cells then die and pass through the body naturally as waste products			2
in august 2010 writer @entity139 had knee lipo with dr @entity141 of @entity21 , a ' high - profile cosmetic doctor with a reputation for being able to eliminate cellulite and other supposedly incurable aesthetic misfortunes '			1
he used his new @entity147 machine which works like liposuction to vanquish fat , tightening the skin at the same time and improving its tone and texture			0
' it 's amazing for treating areas like the knees - and it 's not even painful ! ' he enthuses			0
' but you do need to wear a special garment afterwards			0
' we asked leading plastic surgeon @entity160 to keep a diary for a week in march 2011			0
he wrote of his work at the @entity163 in @entity164			0
' i saw three men with moobs this week alone and it ’s on the increase , partly because we are all getting fatter			0
but i also see them on men who are otherwise fit			0
' the best option is liposuction because it does n’t leave scars			0
