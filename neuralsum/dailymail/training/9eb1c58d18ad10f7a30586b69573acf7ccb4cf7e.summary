two @entity1 men have now confessed to murdering @entity4 backpackers @entity2 and @entity5 on the island of @entity7 , according to police			1
officers arrested three men who were pictured riding a moped away from the scene of the killings on september 14			1
two have admitted their guilt , but the third still denies any involvement			2
it is not known which of the men in the @entity21 image have confessed			2
after the first admission of guilt , a credible source within the police ranks on ' murder island ' told @entity27 that he had been called by a senior officer who said : ' we have a confession			1
we have a suspect in custody			0
we are very confident we have our man			0
it is not known which of the three he is investigation : one of the suspects is led in handcuffs by police the bodies of @entity5 , 24 , and @entity39 , 23 , were found on a beach on @entity7 on september 15 major general @entity51 , who is leading the investigation , has since confirmed that another of the migrant workers has also confessed			1
are three suspects are being held in the city of @entity57 , the closest mainland metropolis to the central @entity60 islands			0
officers previously said they will take the suspects back to @entity7 for a reenactment of the crime , before those who have pleaded guilty are returned to jail awaiting court			2
news of the first confession came through a short statement from deputy police commissioner general @entity71 who said the arrested man was called @entity73 , a bar worker on @entity7 , who was arrested in @entity75			1
the announcement came before the man 's dna could be confirmed as a match with @entity77 found on the body of 23 - year - old miss @entity81 from @entity83			2
but the police source told the mail last night : ' we are expecting the dna results by late today or on friday at the latest			2
' according to the @entity91 newspaper , quoting sources , @entity73 told police that he saw ' the foreigners having sex so he made the attack with a plan to rape the woman			2
' however , there appears to be a discrepancy in that statement as there is no evidence that @entity103 and mr @entity5 were walking on the beach together and stopped near the guest house where they were both staying for a sexual encounter in the early hours of the morning			0
the last known picture of the pair , together with a group at the sports bar called @entity113 - they also went to the @entity115 bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament and police have said previously that no trace of mr @entity5 's dna had been found on @entity103			1
but they have said that dna from two @entity125 men had been recovered from her			0
last week , in the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation of the murders , police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped and said they were ' confident ' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon			0
police have taken more than 200 dna samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from @entity1			1
but there have been no matches so far with the victims			0
police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly Â£ 13,300 - for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits			0
yesterday @entity148 police were accused of beating up a taxi driver who refused to give false evidence about a football team suspected of being involved in the killings			2
@entity153 claims he was offered the full 700,000 baht reward if he agreed to be a fake witness to events leading up to the deaths , but says officers attacked him when he said no. he said he complained to the district chief @entity159 and asked for protection over fears of another attack after the officers said they intended to question him again on tuesday			0
dressed in a pink top and white skirt , @entity39 looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of @entity103 , who hails from @entity83 , in the early hours of september 15			1
a condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman 's dna on its outer skin			0
two different semen samples collected from ms @entity39 's body form the remainder of the dna evidence , @entity148 police told the @entity182			1
' the discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence , ' said provincial police commander @entity187 said earlier this week			0
' solving this crime is going to come down to dna matches and we are working hard on this			0
' police believe mr @entity5 , who lived in @entity193 , was killed when he went to his recently - met friend 's aid after finding in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach			0
around 150 additional police officers have posted to @entity7 to assist the murder investigation			1
the probe was launched after cleaners found the bodies of @entity103 and mr @entity5 on a beach on 15 september			1
both victims suffered severe head injuries at the hands of their killers , and a bloodied garden hoe was found nearby .			1
