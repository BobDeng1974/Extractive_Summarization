@entity0 on wednesday joined countries like @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 to support a proposal moved by @entity7 denying staff benefits to gay couples at the @entity10			1
the move was defeated as 80 votes were polled against it while 43 countries , including @entity0 , backed it			1
speaking against the proposal , @entity17 ambassador to the @entity10 @entity18 said : “ we must speak plainly about what @entity7 tried to do today … diminish the authority of the @entity10 secretary general and export to the @entity10 its domestic hostility to @entity26 ( @entity26 ) rights			1
” the @entity10 extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries			2
( @entity33 picture ) @entity0 went with the @entity7 proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations			1
the @entity10 extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries			2
but last year , secretary general @entity38 had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws			1
the @entity7 envoy at the @entity10 had strongly advocated in favour of extending the domestic laws to respect cultural differences of the members of the world body			2
this is also perhaps the reason for @entity0 to back the @entity7 proposal			1
while @entity5 and @entity3 were the other countries on @entity0 ’s side , 37 members abstained and 34 did not vote at all			2
@entity0 ’s own legal provision on the issue has been subject of much debate			0
@entity56 was struck down in 2009 only to be revived by the @entity57 last year			0
there is one last chance for the gay community to get homosexual acts decriminalised by the @entity57			0
after their review petition against the judgment which made gay sex a crime punishable with life was dismissed on january 28 , 2014 , the activists filed a curative petition before the apex court on april 3 , 2014 which it has decided to hear in an open court			0
the apex court said the government ’s indecision and flip - flop on the issue was to be squarely blamed for the situation			0
@entity79 , which ruled that making or changing of a law was the sole prerogative of @entity82 , questioned why the government had not acted even 13 years after a @entity85 report sought deletion of the section and there were repeated demands			0
the court said this proved that the @entity92 wanted the section to remain in the statute .			0

@entity0 voted to support a proposal by @entity7 , to deny gay couples working for the @entity10 staff benefits
the move was defeated by 80 votes to 43
