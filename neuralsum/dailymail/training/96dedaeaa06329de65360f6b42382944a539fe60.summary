by @entity0 published : 03:36 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 08:26 est , 21 march 2012 the jury heard part - time dj @entity2 became as popular as @entity3 after fraudsters downloaded his songs in a £ 1m scam on @entity7 and @entity8 a part - time @entity2 from @entity11 became as popular as @entity3 after fraudsters downloaded his songs in a £ 1million swindle on @entity7 and @entity8 , a court heard today			1
@entity2 , 26 , sold so many tracks he featured in the download sales charts after thousands of stolen credit cards were used to buy his music			1
white - known as @entity17 - and 11 others were involved in the scam which cost @entity7 and @entity8 up to £ 1million in royalties that were paid to the musician for each download			1
gang members used at least 24 laptops loaded with sophisticated software designed to disguise their location and bought music with stolen credit card details			1
through @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31 they uploaded about 20 tracks produced by @entity2 and a number of other artists to fleece @entity7 and @entity8 between january 2008 and june 2009			1
jurors heard eleven others including the ' main man ' @entity37 , 24 , have admitted their involvement in the con			0
prosecutor @entity40 said : ' it was a fraud on both @entity7 and @entity8 and , between them , these companies lost between £ 750,000 and £ 1million to a collection of lads based principally in @entity11			2
' the main man and the main beneficiary was a man called @entity37			0
' @entity37 and fellow fraudsters discovered they could upload songs via agents on to @entity7 and @entity8			0
' they then bought a number of , at least 24 , identical laptops and they got hold , in due course , of something called " @entity57 " which was intended to disguise where the downloads were being carried out from , ' miss @entity52 said			0
' they got hold of literally thousands and thousands of compromised credit card details , both from @entity63 and the @entity64 , and they used those cards to download their own music from @entity7 and @entity8			1
' every time they downloaded their own music an amount of royalties was generated			1
through @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31 they uploaded about 20 tracks produced by @entity2 and a number of other artists to fleece @entity7 and @entity8 between january 2008 and june 2009 ' for each download the amount was very small but , by the time you add it up to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of downloads the amount is quite high			1
' they were caught , really , for two reasons ; principally because they were greedy and also because the @entity57 software did not work as they had hoped			0
' the police were able to track them through @entity92 accounts and email address out to the bank accounts of the 12 people			0
' in all they obtained £ 500,000 before they were stopped			1
' miss @entity98 added : ' why the difference between £ 1million and £ 500,000 ? ' @entity7 and @entity8 lost the whole amount because they had to repay the genuine card holders the whole amount			1
' the royalty payments were , by definition , going to be a portion of that			0
' the total amount lost is greater than the total amount of benefit that was obtained			0
' @entity2 was a part - time dj in the @entity11 area and not a ' big time rockstar '			2
' somebody at @entity7 noticed that a complete unknown from @entity11 called @entity114 , also known as @entity115 , operating entirely on his own , rather than through a record company and without any marketing that anybody could see , was selling so much on @entity7 that his name featured in the volume sales charts , ' said miss @entity52			0
@entity2 sold as many downloads as pop queen @entity3 as part of the alleged scam , jurors heard ' he was selling so much and earning so much in the way of royalties he was selling at a rate you would expect from the likes of @entity3			1
' three other men @entity132 , 39 , @entity133 , 43 , and @entity134 , 32 , were also said to be involved			0
the jury was told that after the fraud was discovered royalty payments were stopped @entity2 's music was removed from the site and £ 113,000 was withheld			1
miss @entity52 said : ' shortly after they were stopped @entity29 started to get a number of calls and emails from a man calling himself @entity144			2
' @entity144 demanded payment of the outstanding royalties			2
' what he did not know was that @entity29 knew there was a fraud and they were in touch with @entity63 law enforcement			0
' @entity29 hoped to persuade him to identify himself by persuading him to come to @entity153 to collect his royalties			0
' they said they were unable to pay that amount of money for tax reasons and he needed to come to @entity153			0
' they offered to send him free air tickets and put him up			0
' at that stage @entity144 said that the tickets would have to be sent in the name of @entity2 and he gave @entity2 's real name and real address for the tickets to be posted to			2
' that gave the authorities the name of @entity2 and further investigation and tracking of where the money had gone to led to the uncovering of all 11 other defendants apart from @entity115 , all of whom have been before the court			1
' @entity2 denies one count of conspiracy to defraud between january 2008 and june 2009			2

@entity2 and 11 others downloaded music with stolen credit cards , court hears
@entity188 made £ 500,000 in royalties before being stopped
