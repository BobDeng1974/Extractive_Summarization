' communicating : while @entity4 is unable to talk , he is able to express himself through his @entity37 and uses apps tell stories to family and friends @entity4 was diagnosed when he was 17 months old after doctors had monitored him because of his lack of progression			1

' when you receive confirmation that your child had a disability , all your plans for the future change instantly			0

@entity88 is a rare genetic condition first identified in 1965 by a @entity26 doctor , @entity25			1
dr @entity25 had noticed similarities between a small number of previously undiagnosed children that seemed to indicate they had a common problem			2
after seeing a painting in the @entity118 museum in @entity119 , @entity120 , entitled a boy with a puppet he was inspired to write a medical paper entitled @entity124			0
the syndrome - originally called ' @entity9 ' because of the characteristic happy demeanour and stiff jerky movements of the children - was renamed @entity88 in 1982			2
although at first little was known and indeed few other cases identified , in recent years much more has been learned			0
during the 1980s advances in genetic medicine made it possible to diagnose increasing numbers of cases and also to start identifying the cause			0
in simple terms , it is a chromosome disorder that causes severe learning difficulties			1
@entity88 is not a disease , it is a neurological disorder that causes severe learning difficulties , and although those affected have a normal life expectancy , they will require looking after throughout their lives			1
most as children are diagnosed between the ages of three and seven when the characteristic physical and behavioural features become @entity150 more information visit : @entity151			0
