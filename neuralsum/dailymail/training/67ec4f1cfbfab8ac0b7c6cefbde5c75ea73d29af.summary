president @entity0 claimed monday night during a @entity2 fundraising dinner that the @entity3 is ' stronger ' than it was when he assumed office in january 2009			1
his statement , though , appears to be at odds with key economic indicators , @entity14 's sliding reputation abroad , and the @entity3 public 's estimation of the direction the country has taken under the @entity0 administration			1
' in all sorts of ways , ' @entity0 told @entity2 partisans who paid between $ 15,000 to $ 32,400 to hear him speak , ' we are not just stronger than when we – where we were when i first came into office			2
' he took off his golf glove : @entity0 took a break from his vacation to call foreign leaders with national security adviser @entity28 on monday before heading to a @entity2 fundraiser where he claimed @entity14 is ' stronger ' now than in january 2009 distance : @entity3 and members of @entity31 do n't seem to believe @entity0 's foreign policy inspires confidence ' it ’s fair to say that @entity14 has the best cards when you look at other countries around the world			1
there ’s no other country you ’d rather be than the @entity3			0
' ' nobody can compete with us when we ’re making the right decisions , ' he said			0
but @entity3 have become increasingly skeptical about the decisions emerging from the @entity47 , both on domestic and foreign policy			2
by a 20 - point margin , they believe the nation is weaker under @entity0 's leadership , according to a @entity53 poll released in june			2
just 35 per cent told pollsters they agreed with what @entity0 said monday night			0
a whopping 68 per cent said the @entity0 administration is less competent than @entity57 's was			0
overall , a paltry 23 per cent of @entity3 voters believe @entity14 is on the ' right track			2
' that number is from a @entity62 poll released august 6			0
@entity0 's job approval rating hit an all - time low of 40 per cent last week , according to an @entity67 / @entity66 survey			2
just 36 per cent of @entity3 give a thumbs - up to his handling of foreign policy			1
@entity0 appear to be fighting an uphill battle : most polls show that his party will suffer a stinging defeat on @entity75 in november , with the reliably center - left @entity76 predicting a strong likelihood that @entity79 will control both houses of @entity31 for the last two years of his presidency			0
' if the president thinks his record is going to help @entity2 in the fall , he 's whistling past the graveyard , ' a @entity79 political consultant who has advised presidential candidates told @entity88			0
key indicator : the ratio of @entity14 's debt to its gross domestic product has skyrocketed under @entity0 ' his coattails have shrunk to lilliputian proportions , and it 's well deserved , ' he said			1
' his entire agenda will be doa after @entity79 retake the @entity97 in november , and he has no one to blame but himself			0
' the @entity3 economy has slid into troubling territory in recent years			0
the percentage of working - age @entity3 who are part of the @entity3 workforce has reached the lowest level since 1978 , with one out of every three staying on the sidelines and not working			0
and the federal government 's debts have ballooned by $ 7 trillion since @entity0 took office , a sum larger than the accumulated @entity3 debts between 1776 and the end of the @entity57 administration			1
the ratio of @entity14 's debt to its gdp has skyrocketed under @entity0 , according to the @entity117			1
@entity119 economics professor @entity118 wrote monday in an op - ed for @entity121 that ' [ o ] ver the first five years of @entity0 ’s presidency , the @entity3 economy grew more slowly than during any five - year period since just after the end of @entity125 , averaging less than 1.3 percent per year			1
' @entity127 's ' @entity126 , ' a measure of @entity3 ' confidence in the strength of the @entity3 economy , reached -17 on tuesday			0
the poor showing , according to @entity127 , is due to ' international and domestic challenges , including the rise of @entity135 militants in @entity136 , intense fighting between the @entity138 and @entity139 , increasing @entity3 - @entity141 tensions , a wave of illegal immigrants from @entity14 , and stock market volatility			1
' ' whistling past the graveyard ' : @entity0 may be kidding himself when he claims @entity14 is on the rise , according to one political consultant the immigrant deluge has been particularly harmful for @entity0 's standing among @entity3			1
@entity79 argue that his 2012 policy relaxing deportations of so - called ' @entity153 ' – people brought to the @entity3 illegally as children – has encouraged tens of thousands of @entity14 to send their children northward alone			2
the border battles and @entity0 's policies overseas have monopolized news coverage of the @entity47 for weeks as he has struggled to fend off criticisms of his handling of crises in @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity136			1
even @entity165 , his former secretary of state , has been piling on			0
she took the president to task last week , telling the @entity168 that his ' failure ' to arm @entity164 rebels opposing dictator @entity171 ultimately led to the rapid rise of @entity173 , a militant @entity174 terror group that is making steady military advances across @entity164 and @entity136 while it slaughters religious and ethnic minority groups			2
' the failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against @entity171 – there were @entity135 , there were secularists , there was everything in the middle – the failure to do that left a big vacuum , which the jihadists have now filled , ' @entity57 said			0
@entity0 has heard that criticism before , and called it ' horses * * t ' during a meeting with members of @entity31 last month , according to a lawmaker who spoke to @entity198 .			1

president made the claim at a @entity2 fundraiser on @entity203
@entity3 labor *participation* rate is at a 36 - year low and @entity14 's debts have grown by $ 7 trillion since he took office
fifty - five per cent of @entity3 say the @entity3 is weaker under @entity0 , and just one - quarter believe the country is headed in the right direction
pols from right and left are *ripping* into his @entity218 policies , with @entity0 saying criticism of his *actions* in @entity164 is horses * * t '
*non-interventionist* foreign policy has brought *snickers* as @entity0 *refuses* to protect @entity163 from @entity227 - led *invasion* and @entity136 *pullout* *backfires*
