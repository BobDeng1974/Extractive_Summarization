a daredevil conservationist and his team have taken @entity3 's most stomach - churning seflie - from the top of a 404ft medieval spire			1
@entity6 , 46 , clerk of works at @entity8 in @entity9 , and a team of helpers took a number of pictures from the capstone at the very top of the spire while carrying out repairs			1
kitted out in ropes , a harness and a hard hat mr @entity6 , who is in charge of the cathedral 's conservation , made the hair - raising climb to replace a faulty wind meter accompanied by rope access specialists			1
he then climbed through the door and pulled himself up the last 30 feet to the capstone using rungs set into the outside of the spire 's masonry			0
it is only the fourth time mr @entity6 , from @entity8 , has made the climb and something that will not be repeated for another three or four years			1
he replaced the anemometer , a device for measuring wind speed , which had stopped working properly in wind and rain			0
mr @entity6 scaled ten narrow ladders inside the spire to a small weather door before he climbed out and pulled himself up the last 30 feet to the capstone using rungs set into the outside of the spire 's masonry ( pictured ) the stomach churning view photographed by mr @entity6 and his team as they scaled the medieval cathedral mr @entity6 and his team also abseiled down the east side to check out and plug a leak that was discovered as a result of the september storms			1
while most cathedrals in medieval times took centuries to build , @entity73 's was erected in just 38 years by 300 men from 1220 to 1258			0
the spire was added later between 1300 and 1330 and the cathedral is the tallest medieval structure in the world			2
@entity8 also has @entity3 's largest cloister and largest cathedral close , the world 's oldest working clock and the best surviving of the four original copies of the @entity88			2
mr @entity6 pictured replacing the anemometer , a device for measuring wind speed , which had stopped working one of the terrifying birds - eye views of the cathedral taken by mr @entity6 from the top of the spire mr @entity6 said : ' it 's a very exciting day for me because i do n't get to go up the spire very often at all and it 's probably going to be the last time for another three or four years			1
' the cathedral is the tallest medieval structure in the world , 404ft to get to the capstone			2
' when you climb out the weather door the spire is quite wide , but the higher you go the more narrow it gets and you do feel a bit like " is this going to take my weight ? " but it will , it 's been there for 800 years			2
' it is quite exposed and you can see all the way around you			0
' when you get up there your heart is definitely in your mouth and all of your senses are heightened			0
' you 're super safe but it 's certainly an adrenaline rush			0
' the hardest bit is making yourself climb out of the door when you 're perfectly safe inside and when you abseil back down to go in the door , with the harness and all the equipment you need and it 's a narrow door it can be quite tight to get back in			0
' if there 's two or three of you up there and one of you moves you can feel the spire slightly swaying			0
' mr @entity6 said if there is more than one person up the spire and someone moves you can feel the spire sway			1
