do you have any idea how much sugar you 're eating ? it 's probably a lot more than you think			1
as this shocking graphic reveals , millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar - and getting fatter in the process			1
while some culprits , such as @entity12 and ice cream are well known ( and used here for comparison purposes ) , there are many other less obvious foods - such as pasta sauce , soup and so - called healthy granola - that are loaded with the white stuff			1
for example , a 500g jar of @entity23 bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a @entity28 bar			1
and @entity30 tomato soup is on par with @entity33 's cider in the sweetness stakes , with five cubes			1
however the sugars in milk , vegetables and pieces of fruit ( as opposed to fruit juice ) , including dried fruit , do not wreak as much havoc			0
so if you ’re getting most of your sugar from these sources , you can eat up to 18 cubes daily			1
more and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic			1
it is the sheer quantity of sugar that we consume that creates the problem , says @entity66 , professor of medicine and metabolism at @entity69			0
‘ sugar calories slip down so easily and lead to weight gain			0
’ the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person 's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks , but also those found naturally in honey , syrups and fruit juices			1
that equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink			1
however , the @entity88 agency advises that people aim for no more than five per cent - 25g or around six teaspoons - to achieve the biggest health benefits			0
yet many of us are consuming way in excess of this			0
a report published by the @entity96 earlier this month revealed the current average intake of free sugars in @entity98 and @entity99 is 95g a day ( 19 cubes ) rising to 130g ( 26 cubes ) a day in @entity102			2
meanwhile in @entity104 the average is 101g ( 20 cubes )			0
hidden health threat : a 500g jar of @entity23 bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a @entity28 bar			1
meanwhile @entity30 tomato soup is on par with @entity33 's cider , with five cubes			2
with the global obesity crisis spiralling out of control , health experts are becoming increasingly vocal about the dangers of ' hidden sugar ' in food			1
@entity122 , professor of @entity123 at the @entity124 at @entity125 and the @entity126 , says the food industry is adding more and more sugar to food , which consumers are largely unaware of , as it is mostly hidden			0
he said : ' added sugar in our diet is a very recent phenomenon and only occurred when sugar , obtained from sugar cane , beet and corn , became very cheap to produce			1
' it ’s a completely unnecessary part of our calorie intake : it has no nutritional value , gives no feeling of fullness and is acknowledged to be a major factor in causing obesity and diabetes both in the @entity146 and worldwide			2
' the two most common forms of unhealthy added sugars are table sugar ( sucrose ) and high - fructose corn syrup , a liquid sweetener made from maize			1
both are added to countless foods , turning up in everything from fizzy drinks to chicken korma			2
sugars in fruit juices and honeys are also the unhealthy ‘ added ’ type			0
‘ added sugars are more likely to do harm as they are n’t safely bound in the structure of a food , as they are in fruit , ’ says @entity163 , a spokesperson for the @entity164			0
‘ it means they are available to the body in higher concentrations			0
’ he added : ' while it may not be surprising that a can of @entity12 has a staggering seven cubes of sugar ( 35g ) , similar amounts can be found in the most unlikely of foods			1
' these include flavoured water , yogurts , canned soup , ready meals and even bread			0
professor @entity122 also cautions against opting for low fat foods that are often full of sugar instead to give them flavour			2
' you might opt for 0 per cent fat in your yoghurt , but what if it also comes with five teaspoons of sugar ? a bowl of @entity201 with semi-skimmed milk only has four			0
' as @entity205 , from the @entity206 , says : ' stripping out fat from processed foods makes them less appealing to our taste buds			0
' the inevitable consequence is that manufacturers increase other ingredients , including sugar , to recreate taste and texture			0
' research also shows the huge toll sugar can take on our health			2
though we all need some sugar - it is the essential fuel that powers all cells in our body - excess levels have been linked with raised levels of the hormone insulin , which increases the risk of diabetes			1
furthermore , the body turns excess sugar into fat , which is stored around the major organs , placing us at risk of liver and heart disease			0
there are also fears that high sugar diets may promote some cancers			2
the theory is that glucose , one of the main ingredients in added sugar , creates repeated spikes of insulin			1
even a ‘ healthy ' fruit such as a mango contains nine cubes , while a @entity251 strawberry yogurt has 2.5 for reasons that are not clear , many tumours seem to have insulin receptors , hence a rise in this hormone fuels their growth			2
a large population study in the @entity259 showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease			1
that was compared with those people who consumed less than 10 per cent of their calories each day through sugar , independent of other risk factors including weight			1
professor @entity122 believes the sugar in our diets should now be gradually reduced , just as salt has been over the past few years			0
' @entity276 content in food products in the supermarkets have now been reduced by 20 - 40 per cent and as a result , salt intake has fallen in the @entity146 by 15 per cent ( between 2001 - 2011 ) , the lowest known figure of any developed country			0
' ' like salt , most of the sugar we consume is hidden in processed food and soft drinks			0
' there are also specific taste receptors for sugar , which if sugar intake is gradually reduced , become more sensitive			0
so over time we do n’t notice that sugar levels have gone down			2

millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar
high levels can be found in less obvious foods , such as sauces and soup
500g jar of @entity23 bolognaise sauce contains more than 6 cubes of sugar
500ml of *orange* juice contains 10 cubes and a mango contains 9
experts say we should eat no more than 10 cubes of added sugar a day
evidence shows too much sugar is contributing to obesity and diabetes
