a drought in the western @entity1 has left water levels in the @entity4 basin far below their normal levels			2
@entity6 , a reservoir at the @entity10 - @entity9 border , is 45 per cent below its capacity , and the lack of water has left a ' bathtub ring ' at the bottom of its majestic rock formations			1
the lake , from which the @entity4 eventually snakes through @entity18 , has lost 4.4 trillion gallons of water in a recent drought			0
the river 's basin has been experiencing the drought for eleven of the last 14 years , shrinking a reservoir that was one - fourth the size of @entity25 when it was at ' full pool ' , according to @entity27			1
seven states and 40million people get water from different parts of the river 's basin , which extends into the southern reaches of @entity50			2
many climate scientists think that the @entity52 is also due for a megadrought this century that would far outlast the current phenomenon			0
@entity55 , the reservoir next to @entity57 , shrunk to 39 per cent of its capacity last year and was at its lowest level since the dam was built in the 1930s			1
to help the other reserve keep a steady supply , @entity6 will release 8.23 million acre - feet ( 2.68 trillion gallons ) downstream over the course of this year			2
the release is estimated to lower the water level at @entity6 , the second largest reservoir in the country behind @entity55 , by another meter			1
it is in danger of seeing its surface elevation fall below 1,075 feet above sea level by september , which would be the lowest level on record , set in 2005 , and increase the size of its bleached white ring			0
minerals in the water turn the walls of the sandstone canyons white , according to the @entity82			0
minerals in the @entity4 turned the sides of @entity6 's canyons white before the water levels dropped and the discoloration could be seen @entity6 provides water to @entity37 , @entity10 , and @entity38 , which has been experiencing its own drought problems the reservoir is now at 45 per cent capacity after losing water from drought for most of the past 14 years around 40million people get water from different parts of the @entity4 basin , and @entity6 ( pictured ) used to be one - fourth the size of @entity25 @entity6 has lost 4.4 trillion gallons of water this century , rapidly decreasing in size from 1999 to 2013 sections of extreme drought have hit many states of the southwestern @entity1 , including @entity10 , @entity4 , @entity37 and @entity38 the @entity4 basin stretches from the southern reaches of @entity50 to southwestern states such as @entity10 ( pictured ) @entity6 is a major @entity10 vacation spot and draws more than 2million visitors to the reservoir each year sections of @entity6 that used to be under water , such as this are of @entity112 , @entity9 , now stand dry and pebbles from the riverbed are exposed @entity6 will release trillions of gallons of water through @entity118 ( pictured ) so that @entity55 , next to @entity57 , will not dramatically lose water levels the diminishing of the @entity4 has exposed vegetation from the riverbed , such as that on this section around @entity125 motorboats can still navigate on some stretches of the river , though paddle boats are necessary for other parts water lines are visible on a section of @entity6 that used to be under water but has now been exposed by a drought not all areas sport the white bath tub ring from where water used to be , though areas such as this part of @entity112 , @entity9 , are also dramatically diminished from their surging heydays @entity6 reached a record low of 3555 feet in 2005			1
above , boaters tour the @entity143 in the @entity145 formations in 2007 scientists believe that the western @entity1 may be due for a megadrought sometime this century this map shows the severity of the drought in the western @entity1 , with ' exceptional ' drought in dark red , ' extreme ' drought in red and ' severe ' in orange			0
drought levels are based off precipitation and moisture indices			0

eleven of the past 14 years have been droughts for @entity6 reservoir
reservoir at @entity10 - @entity9 border is 45 per cent below ' full pool ' capacity
@entity6 will drop even further as it gives water to @entity57 's @entity55
