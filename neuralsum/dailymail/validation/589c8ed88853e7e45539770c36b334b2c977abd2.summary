for one final time , the greatest ever jump jockey will grace his sport ’s most spectacular and exciting stage			1
i urge you not to miss him			0
@entity9 nineteen - time champion jump jockey and the most recognisable initials in sport			1
the 2015 @entity12 boasts a glittering cast of equine and human stars but the spotlight is on one man			1
@entity17 ( right ) will ride @entity19 - trained @entity18 in the @entity20 at @entity12 the one who will finally walk away from the sport by the end of this season after announcing his abdication following an unchallenged 20 - year reign			1
he is the phenomenon whose record - smashing , off - the - scale achievements have transcended the parochial boundaries of horse racing , the patron saint to millions of punters and sworn enemy of bookmakers			2
but both sides of that age - old skirmish will probably be praying that the 40 - year - old from @entity38 has a final festival to remember			1
the next four days for @entity7 are not the last time he will ride			1
it will probably not even be the last time he rides at @entity12			1
@entity7 celebrates winning the @entity42 with @entity43 in 2012 but it seems like the equivalent of @entity47 ’s last game on @entity49 ’s @entity48 , @entity50 playing his final frame at @entity52 and — should @entity53 make it through — @entity54 stepping on to the @entity56 turf in an @entity58 final			1
but none of those icons can boast the domination of their own sport like @entity7 has ruled racing			1
he is arguably the best pound - for - pound sportsman around — something crucial in a sport where weights and measures equate to short - head victories or defeats			1
and nobody loves winning and hates losing more than @entity9 @entity73 wins started with @entity74 in the 1996 @entity75			0
look back a further 12 months and no - one would have guessed the shape of the last 20 years			2
his first meeting , then held over three days , consisted of seven rides , three of them 100 - 1 shots			2
first up was @entity82 , who was 16th of 20 in the @entity84 ’ @entity85			0
champion jockey @entity7 will be competing his his last @entity12 before retirement there was a seventh place finish on veteran @entity89 behind @entity91 in the @entity42 and his best was sixth place on @entity93 in the @entity94			1
the middle wednesday he was riding at @entity95 — a track that does not have a jumps course any more — where he rode a winner			0
that first experience of the @entity12 probably taught the young @entity7 that @entity12 is great when you are successful but miserable when it goes wrong			1
losing can tear you apart			0
it is a feeling i know well and @entity7 probably enjoyed that @entity95 winner far more than merely being able to play a bit part at the @entity12			1
just taking part has never been enough for him			0
there have been times when his pain has been plain for all to see			0
he got plenty of stick for not smiling even when he won , never mind when he lost			0
there have been agonising defeats and seasons when his lack of big race @entity12 ammunition has been tough to take			2
the fatal injuries to @entity119 in the @entity120 and @entity121 in the @entity122 deeply affected him			0
jump jockey @entity7 has always been a fans ' favourite at @entity12 as he has got older , he has become better equipped to cope with the @entity12 roller - coaster of emotions			1
there will be plenty who point to the tally of 41 @entity12 wins for @entity17 — a total fuelled by his alliance with @entity133 powerhouse trainer @entity19 and his former tie - up with @entity136 champion trainer @entity135 — and ask what the @entity7 fuss is all about ? who is the better jockey ? who has the best technique ? these are subjective assessments which will never be finally settled			1
i can not tell you @entity7 has some peerless faultless technique others can only dream of			2
but i can write of the single - minded drive the like of which i have never known			2
the bloody - minded determination that can make the impossible possible , just as he did when lifting home @entity150 to win on the opening day in 2009			2
there is the massive physical strength and resilience to inevitable injury			0
and i can tell you of the unparalleled professionalism he brings to every ride , an unmatched ability to get off a horse and accurately assess its ability and future career direction as well as his encyclopaedic knowledge of rivals ’ strengths and weaknesses			0
over the next four days , the chances are @entity17 will ride more winners than @entity7 , who is 10 - 1 to be top jockey at the meeting			1
but @entity9 will view those odds as a challenge			0
he has sound claims in today ’s @entity122 on title holder @entity173 , a clutch of handicap possibilities and a strong chance with @entity178 in friday ’s @entity94			0
later that day , @entity179 will be his mount to win a third @entity42			0
the @entity133 @entity182 winner , who runs in the colours of his boss , owner @entity184 , and is trained by @entity185 , has solid claims in an open year			2
@entity187 would be a fairytale ending for both @entity9 and the sport			0
and you would not bet against it			0
you never bet against @entity9			0

jockey @entity7 will appear @entity12 for the last time
the nineteen - time champion jump jockey to retire at end of the season
the 40 - year - old is arguably the best pound - for - pound sportsman around
