by @entity0 so after all the tears and tantrums , we finally have a triumph			2
‘ hey @entity12 , try winning in @entity13 , ’ @entity5 once teased him in a note left in his locker , after @entity9 was bitching about a tee - time with the journeymen at the @entity11			1
well , now he has			2
let others churlishly remark that it was on the old men ’s circuit that he finally achieved it , that he used to proclaim you would never find him playing seniors golf in a million years ( @entity12 contradicting himself ? surely not ! )			1
or that you ca n’t count the @entity23 as a real major			2
silverware : @entity9 won the @entity25 in @entity26 on sunday special moment : @entity9 finally won his first event in @entity13 at the 135th time of asking look down that illustrious leaderboard and you ’ll understand why 50 - year - old @entity12 will regard winning for the first time in @entity13 at the 135th time of asking on sunday as one of the special moments of his career			1
in second place : @entity37			2
it does n’t get much better , does it ? it ’s less than a month since @entity38 was finishing in the top 10 at the masters			0
he ’s a runaway leader on the grandiosely titled @entity42			0
yet @entity12 wiped the floor with him			1
did someone switch off that notorious temper once he reached 50 ? did he finally realise you ca n’t pick a fight with @entity13 galleries and still win a major ? here was the @entity12 we always wanted to see at a @entity51 or the other @entity52			1
he always had the talent , he had a surplus of it			0
but here he added the requisite calm as well			0
out in front : @entity9 finished four shots clear of @entity37 in @entity59 taunt : @entity5 once joked about @entity9 's inability to win in @entity13 it ’s almost 20 years since he contested a play - off for the @entity64 with @entity65 in the boiling heat of @entity67			1
on the telly in the clubhouse , a cavalcade of police vehicles were on the @entity73 highways in mad pursuit of the celebrated @entity13 footballer @entity75 , suspected ( later controversially cleared ) of murdering his wife , @entity76			1
it was n’t long before @entity12 was giving vain chase to the @entity80			1
his face was so red he looked ready to explode			0
not for the first or last time we thought : ‘ how can he hope to win in such a rage ? ’ there were many other near misses , of course			0
none was more painful than 2006 at @entity89			0
one hole to go and my boss sent me an excited text : ‘ he ’s only going to go and finally do it , is n’t he ? ’ one double bogey later , and we had the painful riposte : ‘ sadly not			0
’ drought : @entity12 never won one of golf 's majors , coming agonisingly close at the @entity64 ‘ i ’ve got a full diary on tuesday and it is going to be a bit strange going back to giving lessons after this			1
’ it ’s back on the range at @entity109 in @entity110 for 30 - year - old @entity111 after playing with @entity64 champion @entity112 in the final round of the @entity114			0
@entity111 claimed his place in the field after winning the @entity119 ’s @entity118 order of merit last year with season ’s earnings of around £ 12,000			0
on sunday , he finished a highly creditable 38th and won £ 24,000			2
how lovely to see him so becalmed and for all the crucial putts to drop			0
how delicious to see the golfing gods indulge in a little mischief on the 18th , as a rare wayward approach cannoned off the grandstand and back into the middle of the green			0
it would n’t have mattered where it had bounced , he was so far ahead by that stage , but clearly the heavens had decided : there you go , @entity12 , there ’s the luck we never gave you when you were raging at us and bemoaning your fortune			1
this was the first time in 25 years that the @entity142 did n’t compete in the @entity25 at @entity143 but there was still no ignoring him , even while the tournament was conjuring up its memorable finish			1
and now he ’s bested @entity37 and @entity38			0
that always did have a certain ring to it			0
@entity151 and @entity152 set to dominate honestly , you wait ages for one of the world ’s elite to win a tournament and then two come along at once			1
no sooner had @entity151 won for the first time since declaring himself free and single again than @entity152 was winning for the first time as a married man			1
@entity152 ’s impressive triumph in a play - off against @entity52 champion @entity164 in @entity165 on sunday came seven days after he achieved his lifetime goal of becoming world no 1 and meant he can enjoy it for a while longer			2
champion : @entity170 won the @entity25 at @entity143 days after splitting from @entity171 how does it fit ? @entity152 won the @entity173 after beating @entity164 in a play - off but now he ’s got the bit between his teeth again , what price @entity151 , back up to world no 6 , chasing him down before the summer is out to reclaim top spot ? i ’ve remarked before that , if everyone was playing their best golf , these two would be a half - step ahead			1
let ’s hope sunday was a foretaste of things to come and this proves to be the summer when they develop a fully fledged friendly rivalry			0
and if they do , @entity151 will come out on top .			2

@entity9 won @entity25 in @entity26
the @entity142 won his first tournament in @entity13 at the 135th attempt
@entity12 never won one of golf 's four majors
when on form , @entity152 and @entity151 are half a step ahead
