snuggling up to each other in the midday sunshine , these lion cub brothers look soft enough to stroke			0
with their pale cream and yellow paws outstretched , @entity4 and @entity8 – both nearly six months old – are still small enough to be handled			1
yet the pair are still recovering after suffering a terrible ordeal because of unscrupulous animal dealers who exploited their cute appearance			2
survivors : @entity15 cubs @entity4 and @entity16 , who were rescued from an amusement part in @entity18 , @entity19 exploitation : the pair , who are believed to have been born in a circus in @entity23 are still recovering after suffering a terrible ordeal because of unscrupulous animal dealers who exploited their cute appearance the @entity27 , visited by thousands of @entity26 every year , was using the cubs for photo opportunities they seem healthy now , but just a few months the two cubs had to be rescued from an amusement park in @entity33 , @entity19 , over claims they were being mistreated			1
the @entity27 , which is visited by thousands of @entity26 tourists every year , was using the cubs for cheap photo opportunities			1
instead of being allowed to roam freely around their enclosures , @entity4 and @entity16 were offered up as props to holidaymakers for 10 euros a snap			1
@entity26 animal lovers spearheaded a global @entity46 campaign to end lion cub petting at the theme park			0
one visitor , mrs @entity52 from @entity53 , @entity54 , said , ' i felt so sorry for them , the cubs looked really sad and shabby , they should n’t me used like that , its so cruel , they should be saved			2
' it might have seemed an innocent activity to tourists , but the lions were victims in a practice banned across most of @entity63			0
cooped up in miserable conditions , they were dangerously underweight and suffering serious illnesses			2
now , after being brought to a sanctuary in the @entity19 capital @entity70 , they are ready to take on the @entity72 savannah			1
friends : @entity16 with @entity74 who rescued him and has since helped to nurse him back to health in @entity70 @entity76 @entity74 and her @entity19 husband @entity77 have nursed @entity4 and @entity16 back to health			1
' we received the lions in july , ' explained mrs @entity82 , who is originally from @entity83			0
' they were only two months old			0
we had got word of the lions being at the @entity27 amusement park			1
' there was a posting on social media of these four young men holding one of the lion cubs			2
' initially people thought these boys were volunteers ; they did n’t realise they were just having their picture taken in an amusement park			0
they had paid 10 euros for the picture , like other tourists there			1
' the woman who arranged this had bought these cubs from @entity23 , from a circus travelling around there			2
' photo opportunity : four young men pose with one of the young lions at @entity27 in @entity18 wretched : one of the young cubs cowers in the side of the street at the theme park which caters to tourists specialist officers from the @entity116 ( which stands for @entity117 ) impounded the lions before they were handed to @entity119 and mrs @entity82			1
' we called them and told them the cubs had to be rescued , ' mrs @entity82 added			1
' this was cruelty and exploitation			0
' the woman did not have papers that proved the lions were born in captivity in @entity63 , so they were taken off her			0
she has been doing this for years apparently , but the amusement park says it is not responsible			0
' there have been many lion cubs there in the past			2
people have posed for pictures with those lions too			0
' after the rescue , we went to see them in a sanctuary in @entity18			1
' they were worn out and only being kept alive on watered - down milk			0
that was all they had ; it meant they would never be able to grow normally			0
' vets took a look at them when we got them back to @entity70 and confirmed they had metabolic bone disease			1
their legs were like rubber ; they could n’t walk very far			0
' they were full of viral infections and bacterial infections			2
neither of them could walk properly because of the sores on their feet			2
' we did n’t think the smallest one , @entity4 , was going to make it			1
for a while we seriously thought he would have to be put down humanely			0
in the end , because he showed such courage and tenacity , we thought this little guy deserves a chance			0
' when the cubs die , the people who do this just buy more from another circus			2
' sores : both @entity4 and @entity16 were suffering from metabolic bone disease , leaving their legs like rubber			1
they were also riddled with viral and bacterial infections , plagued with cataracts , and had feet covered in sores road to recovery : yame underweight and ill when he arrived at the rescue centre following four months of dedicated care from @entity119 and mrs @entity82 , the lions are approaching a suitable weight for six - month - old cubs			1
@entity16 weighs 23kg , and @entity4 is 17kg			1
when @entity16 was brought in , he weighed a pitiful 3kg , dangerously under - weight for a lion cub his age			1
' we ’ve addressed all the problems , ' mrs @entity82 said			0
' they are moving along really , really well			0
the little one @entity4 will probably never ever be completely right			1
' @entity4 still has a bandage on him as a brace while his leg completely heals			1
it is stop more injury while the healing process continues			0
' @entity16 is a lot stronger ; i do n’t think the abuse he went through had the same effect on him as the little one			1
@entity4 was used a lot more because he was smaller to start with			2
his little body just broke			0
' fighting fit : after four months of dedicated care , a now feisty @entity4 bears his teeth @entity16 and @entity4 snuggle up : @entity4 still has a bandage on his leg to support it because it has not yet healed @entity4 snoozes : lions do not have the same protection as tigers under international treaties on endangered species so people who keep lions in shabby conditions for exploitation can not be prosecuted as easily campaign against @entity229 ( @entity230 ) believes cubs like @entity4 and @entity16 would inevitably end up being targets for hunters if kept in captivity			1
the despicable trade , in which lions are bred on farms to later be shot in a controlled enclosure , is most prolific in @entity239			2
hundreds of rich foreigners , mostly @entity76 , travel to country to shoot a lion dead at close quarters just so they can pose for a picture while kneeling over their victim			0
canned hunters take few risks against wild lions , but still brandish their rifles in trophy images they send back to fellow hunting fanatics back home			2
mrs @entity82 claims canned hunting is barely about in @entity63 , but takes place nevertheless			0
lions do not have the same protection as tigers under the @entity257 international treaty on endangered species			0
this means people who keep lions in shabby conditions for exploitation can not be prosecuted as easily			0
' @entity15 will be extinct in the wild by 2025 if we do n’t take urgent action , ' mrs @entity82 said			0
for now , however , @entity4 and @entity16 have been saved from a sad fate so many in their species have endured			1

@entity4 and @entity16 were sold as cubs to the @entity27 in @entity18
their keepers offered them up as cheap photo props at 10 euros a time
both were suffering from infections , bone disease and sores when rescued
they have been nursed back to health in @entity70 by husband and wife team
@entity74 believes they would have ended up shot dead by sick hunters
