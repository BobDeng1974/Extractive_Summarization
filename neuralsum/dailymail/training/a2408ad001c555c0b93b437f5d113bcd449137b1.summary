prime minister @entity0 is to unveil the extension of the party ’s flagship help to buy scheme , which aims to get people on the housing ladder first - time buyers under the age of 40 are to be offered 20 per cent discounts on 100,000 new homes			1
@entity0 is to unveil a dramatic extension of the party ’s flagship @entity15 scheme , which aims to get people on the housing ladder			1
under the scheme , 100,000 houses would be built on so - called ‘ brownfield ’ land and reserved for sale only to young people buying their first homes			2
the ‘ starter homes ’ will be available throughout @entity24 and offered at prices 20 per cent less than their market value			1
so a house worth £ 200,000 could be bought by a first - time buyer for £ 160,000 – a reduction of £ 40,000			1
the discount will be possible because a @entity33 government would exempt housebuilders from some taxes and allow the release of cheap brownfield sites – land formerly used for industrial or commercial purposes – to build these homes on			1
builders would be obliged to pass their savings on to buyers			2
the scheme , to be announced at the @entity33 ’ final party conference before next year ’s general election , is the latest attempt to echo the focus on property ownership of @entity51 ’s government			2
mr @entity0 will say : ‘ we want to help more young people achieve the dream of home ownership so today i can pledge we will build 100,000 homes for young , first - time buyers			1
‘ we will make these starter homes 20 per cent cheaper by exempting them from a raft of taxes and by using brownfield land			1
i do n’t want to see young people locked out of home ownership			0
' we ’ve already started to tackle the problem with @entity65 to buy mortgages – and these new plans will help tens of thousands more people to buy their first home			2
’ as well as helping struggling young people wanting to buy a home , @entity33 strategists believe the policy will appeal to parents and grandparents worried about their families ’ prospects			0
developers will have to demonstrate before planning approval is given that the houses they are planning to build will be at least a fifth cheaper than comparable houses in order to qualify for the cheaper plots and tax exemptions			0
the developments will avoid most of the taxes and regulations that are normally imposed on other new homes , like the community infrastructure levy , imposed by local authorities , and the ‘ @entity93 ’ requirement that a certain number of homes must be affordable			2
the extension of the help to buy scheme will see ‘ starter homes ’ available throughout @entity24 and offered to first - time buyers who are under the age of 40 at prices 20 per cent less than the property 's market value the discount will be possible because a @entity33 government would exempt housebuilders from some taxes and allow the release of cheap brownfield sites - land formerly used for industrial purpose - to build on starter homes will also be exempt from the zero carbon homes standard , an environmental levy			1
they will be built on brownfield land already zoned for development that is no longer needed for industrial or commercial uses , including surplus land owned by public sector organisations			0
it costs less than other land , but is not normally made available to build houses on			0
first - time buyers will be able to combine the 20 per cent discount on the price of the new home with a help to buy mortgage , meaning that both the house and the mortgage will be made more affordable			1
young workers will get guaranteed cheap rent to allow them to save a deposit for their first home under another new @entity33 scheme			0
the ‘ rent to buy ’ programme will offer first - time buyers a 20 per cent discount off their rent for seven years			1
they will then be given the right to buy the home			0
the £ 400million plan from communities secretary @entity140 aims to give young workers a ‘ springboard ’ on to the property ladder			0
the scheme is designed for single people earning £ 33,000 or less and couples on up to £ 66,000			0
housing associations will run the scheme , but ministers will insist the new one - and two - bed flats are given to ‘ hard - working ’ people who have never owned a home			2
the help to buy equity loan scheme was introduced last year to offer buyers a 20 per cent government loan to buy new properties , worth up to 95 per cent loan to value			1
it was due to expire in 2016 but has been extended until 2020			0
housebuilding under @entity161 fell to levels not seen since the 1920s			0
the number of first - time buyers also collapsed , falling 60 per cent from 501,500 in 1997 to just 185,000 in 2009			1
although the total number of new houses being built in the 12 months to june of this year rose to 137,780 – a 22 per cent increase on the previous year – the government says more must be done			0
@entity170 , executive chairman of the @entity171 , said : ‘ increasing housing supply is a huge and complex challenge and significant constraints remain			0
‘ enabling more first - time buyers to realise their ambition of home ownership and introducing policies that allow more land to come forward and increase house building would clearly be positive			1
‘ the industry is keen to work with government to develop any policies that would allow the country to build more high quality homes in the right places			0

' starter homes ' will be available at 20 per cent less than their market value
first - time buyers under the age of 40 will be offered discount on new homes
discount possible because housebuilders would be exempt from some taxes
