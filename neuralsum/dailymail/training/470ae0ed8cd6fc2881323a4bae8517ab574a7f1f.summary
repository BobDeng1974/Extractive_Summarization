she was awarded the payout following a two - year legal battle last month and today at the @entity22 successfully defeated a bid to pay her own estimated £ 919,000 legal costs from the trial			1

last month they lost their appeal and were faced with an increased legal bill from the pop star , estimated at £ 1.5million - as well as their own estimated £ 500,000 bill			1
but , today , appeal judges @entity40 , @entity42 and @entity43 ruled the costs order was ' reasonable ' and dismissed the challenge			1
the legal battle was over a t - shirt featuring a photo taken during a video shoot for @entity0 's hit @entity49 in 2011			1
her legal team successfully argued her fans , who saw her as a fashion icon , would have falsely thought she had endorsed the garment sold by the high - street fashion store			0
in july 2013 , high court judge mr. @entity57 found the store guilty of unlawfully passing off her image , and ordered them to pay her legal costs , even though he found the size of her bill ' startling ' and ' somewhat surprising			0
' but @entity14 , whose own legal costs for the trial amounted to just £ 350,000 , had asked the three appeal judges at a hearing last year to overturn the orders			1
their counsel , @entity72 , said the judge had erred in law			0
but lord @entity42 said today that after careful consideration ' we are unable to accept that the judge fell into error			0
' lawyers for sir @entity28 's @entity14 , which owns @entity2 , argued that there was ' no proper basis ' for forcing them to pay up the bill along with their own costs but appeal judges dismissed the challenge he added : ' it follows that the appeal on costs must be dismissed			1
' @entity0 , who was described as a ' style icon ' by the trial judge , had claimed an estimated £ 3.5million in damages for the wrongful use of her photograph , described as ' unflattering '			0
however an inquiry as to damages and profits made by @entity2 have yet to be heard			0

old friends : rihanna with good friend and @entity2 owner sir @entity28 they were hung on clothes rails in court as mr. @entity107 told the judges the t - shirts were like a canvas carrying words and images			0
lord @entity42 said last month that @entity0 had an enormous reputation and goodwill and people might have bought the t - shirt thinking she had an association with it			2
he said if @entity121 's picture was on a tennis racket or @entity124 's photo on a golf club people would think they endorsed it			0
in his judgment , unanimously backed by the other two judges he dismissed @entity2 's appeal			2
he said there could be a ' false belief ' by customers that the ' world famous pop star ' had endorsed the t - shirt 's bearing her image			1
the court found that ' a substantial number of purchasers are likely to be deceived into buying the t - shirt because of false belief that it has been authorised by @entity0 herself			2
' because of her current tie up with high street rivals @entity145 it was found that the @entity2 t - shirt would be damaging to the style icon 's goodwill and a loss to her merchandising business			2
' it also represents a loss of control over her reputation in the fashion sphere , ' ruled mr. @entity57			0
the @entity160 star , who lives in @entity161 sued the @entity14 in her full name of @entity0 and did no appear in court			2
