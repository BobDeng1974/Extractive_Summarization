the g - spot may not exist in women - but there may be another ' intimate area ' that creates increased sexual pleasure , say doctors it is the legendary erogenous region that divides people the world over regarding its existence			1
but new research suggests that while the fabled g - spot may not exist , all is not lost			1
@entity15 doctors have now described in medical literature an ' intimate area ' that creates increased sexual pleasure			1
it is more complex than one spot , however , and includes the clitoris , vagina and urethra - described as ' highly dynamic and sensitive structures ' by the authors of the new report			1
in their article published in this month 's @entity27 , they say what brings a woman heightened sexual pleasure is much more complex than just one area and includes the complete reproductive system , including the urethra and clitoris			1
the scientists , led by @entity35 , professor of endocrinology and sexology at @entity39 university in @entity40 , say the idea of the one - spot approach first mooted in the 1950s is too simplistic			1
the g - spot was named after @entity45 , a @entity46 gynaecologist who proposed its existence in 1950			1
then in 1976 , the landmark @entity50 on @entity51 suggested that the clitoris is largely responsible for orgasms in most women			0
now , says @entity55 , modern imaging techniques such as ultrasound have enabled gynaecologists and scientists to see what happens to different areas of the reproductive system during sexual activity			0
the report authors write : ' the clitoris , urethra , and anterior ( front ) vaginal wall have led to the concept of a clitourethrovaginal ( @entity72 ) complex			1
' this , they say , defines a broader or ' variable , multifaceted ... area that , when properly stimulated during penetration , could induce orgasmic response '			0
' we know [ thanks to this review ] there is a much more complex than a simple , phantasmagoric " point " , ' adds @entity55 , adding the findings end ' hopefully forever ' discussions on where the elusive g - spot is			1
he says that ' knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the cuv complex ' may help to avoid damage to female genitalia during medical and surgical procedures			2
' the vagina is an active tissue and sexually important to be respected , ' he said			0
the researchers also found tell - tale chemical markers in the area			2
these markers include chemicals that process the nitric oxide responsible for male arousal			0
earlier this year , another doctor spoke out about the myth of the g - spot			2
' we do n't think the g - spot exists and if it does , it 's not a specific physical structure , ' said dr @entity123 , the inventor of the procedure			2
instead , women have an o - spot , he claims - the area near the clitoris and just inside the vagina			1
dr @entity130 offers a treatment called the @entity133 - which he says boosts both libido and sexual satisfaction			0
he added that many women - especially those who are older and / or who have had children - find their clitoral sensitively is reduced - ' sometimes tremendously '			0
earlier this year , another doctor spoke out about the myth of the g - spot			2
instead , women actually have an o - spot - the area near the clitoris and just inside the vagina - says @entity148 doctor @entity147 , who offers ' o - shot injections ( file image ) the o - shot involves drawing blood and then separating out the platelets from it			1
these are then injected into an area near the clitoris and just inside the vagina - dubbed the @entity159 - and stimulates the growth of new cells in this area , making it more sensitive			2
the idea for the treatment came from the @entity165 , also developed by dr @entity123			0
this basically involves injecting blood ( which also contains growth factors ) into the face			0
when these growth factors enter the face , stem cells become activated to grow new tissue			0
this new tissue includes new collagen , new fatty tissue ( for smoothness ) , and new blood vessels ( for a healthy glow )			0
the same principle applies with the @entity133 , which aims to ' plump the clitoris ' and make the vaginal area more sensitive .			0

area that creates increased sexual pleasure is bigger than one spot
includes clitoris , vagina and urethra - the ' clitourethrovaginal ( cuv ) complex '
researchers : ' we hope this will end discussions on where the g - spot is '
findings were reported in the *journal* @entity27
