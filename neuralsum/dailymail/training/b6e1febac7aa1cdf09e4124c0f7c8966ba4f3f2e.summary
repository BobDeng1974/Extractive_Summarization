@entity0 has progressed to the @entity2 quarter - finals for the fifth year in a row after a 6 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 4 victory over @entity5 that was mired in controversy			1
the @entity8 , a beaten finalist last year , clearly angered her @entity10 opponent in the deciding set by walking off court having double - faulted to gift break point in the third game			1
@entity0 demanded a trainer for a sore right shoulder but @entity5 was initially reluctant to return to her chair at such a key moment in the match			2
victory : @entity0 was delighted to come through unscaved against @entity5 controversial : the @entity8 took a physio break at a crucial time in the match after a five - minute medical time - out , during which @entity0 received massages and stretches , the players returned and the 19th seed won the next three points to save her service game			1
she broke in the next and although @entity5 broke back @entity0 eventually clinched the match with a deep return before crumpling to her knees in delight			2
all match her serve had proved her achilles heel			2
her ball toss was erratic and she gave up an astonishing 20 double faults			0
but she progresses to face @entity39 on wednesday hoping to continue her bid to go one better than last year , when she was beaten by @entity41 in the final			1
respect : despite her outrage , @entity5 congratulated her opponent after the match @entity0 denied her choice of medical time - out had been tactical			1
' the timing was very unfortunate , ' she said			0
' i hit a ball before , and it just went into my back			0
i tried to keep going			0
i played a few points but i was n't able to lift my arm			0
i was serving 50 miles an hour or something			0
i do n't remember if i ever served that slow in my life before			0
that 's why i had to call the trainer			1
' to accusations of gamesmanship , she responded : ' i can not change their opinion			0
i just know honest to myself that that has n't been the case because i really tried to play several more points			1
' i have a big respect for my opponent			0
it 's the first time that i had to do it ever			2
that 's the only thing i can say			2
' on a mission : @entity0 is looking to reach the @entity2 final for the second year running			1
