by @entity1 reporter published : 19:40 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 04:31 est , 11 december 2012 concerned : care services minister @entity2 says there needs to be ' complete culture change ' care institutions where vulnerable patients are dumped for years on end will be shut down in the wake of the @entity11 scandal			1
ministers want to end the practice of sending adults and children with learning disabilities to private hospitals and care homes that are often hundreds of miles from where they used to live			1
instead , they want them to be looked after in their own homes or smaller residential centres nearby			0
the plans have been drawn up in the wake of the abuse of residents at @entity11 , a private hospital for adults with learning difficulties near @entity32			1
last year a @entity34 documentary exposed how staff routinely tortured and abused vulnerable patients			2
the facility has since been closed and six staff jailed			0
although the government does not think abuse on this scale is widespread , there is concern that hundreds of patients are being poorly looked after in similar institutions			2
many are sedated with high - dose drugs or forcefully held down if they become upset and aggressive			0
there are currently 1,200 adults and children with learning disabilities placed in what are known as assessment and treatment centres			1
but over the next two years the government wants to reduce the number of patients to between 300 and 400 , and to ensure that they only stay for a few weeks at a time			0
instead , ministers want local councils and @entity60 bodies to enable patients to be looked after in their own homes or to be housed in small , local , centres			2
care services minister @entity2 said : ‘ there has to be a complete culture change			1
would we tolerate someone with cancer getting the wrong sort of treatment or wrong sort of care ? ‘ no , we would n’t , and yet for too long we have tolerated people with learning disabilities being put in the wrong settings			1
scandal : a @entity34 documentary last year exposed abuse at @entity11 private hospital in @entity32 abuse : the investigation exposed how vulnerable patients suffered terrible treatment ‘ they are living in large hospitals , completely inappropriately , where they are put under stress and strain , where their behaviour is inevitably affected			1
’ many of these hospitals are privately owned and ministers fear they may be ‘ profiting from others ’ misery ’			2
they want the owners and boards of directors at these firms to face prosecution if the hospital is found to be abusing or neglecting patients			0
mr @entity2 added : ‘ when you look at @entity11 , the people who committed the abuse and the assaults were convicted , but what about the people making the money from that company ? ’ the government has also instructed the @entity108 watchdog to carry out unannounced inspections of these hospitals next year			1
those found to be failing will be closed down and staff will face prosecution			0
and in june 2014 , @entity60 organisations and councils will have to have drawn up a care - plan for each patient based on their needs			0
in most cases these will state they should be looked after in their own home or local residential centre			0
organisations will have to provide a ‘ justification ’ whenever people continue to be housed in a hospital .			0

ministers want more people with learning disabilities to be treated at home rather than private hospitals and care homes
comes after abuse at @entity139 private hospital in @entity32 was exposed last year
care services minister @entity2 said patients are being put under ' stress and strain ' in large hospitals
