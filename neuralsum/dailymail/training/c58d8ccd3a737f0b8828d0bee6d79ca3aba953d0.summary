the success of @entity2 's athletes has already passed the hopes and expectations of many in managing to match @entity2 's impressive medal - winning run in 2008			1
and with five full days of competition left , it seems certain that @entity6 will beat its @entity39 haul of 47 medals			1

@entity6 's dressage team competed at successive @entity7 for many years without success , which makes their gold medal success to tip @entity6 's 2012 team into the record books perhaps all the more impressive			1
team dressage has been dominated by @entity4 in every games since 1984 - but the magic of @entity7 meant that this was yet another bastion to fall to an apparently unstoppable @entity6 a home crowd saw @entity2 's dressage team win an historic first ever medal at @entity25 @entity2 's @entity17 , pictured riding @entity85 to a first gold medal in the dressage competition this afternoon @entity2 's gold - medal winning success in the @entity45 event took place in the iconic surroundings of @entity25 the three riders - who were on the verge of winning gold after enjoying a marginal points cushion ahead of their @entity4 rivals - managed to hold onto their top podium position in an impressive display this afternoon			1

@entity19 , who was the last of the @entity107 team to compete in the event this afternoon , has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the sport since competing in a grand prix in dressage for the first time in 2011			1
and in a sport which has received relatively little publicity , the contrast in backgrounds between two of @entity6 's riders make for a touching back story			1

@entity19 , on the other hand , was born in @entity216 , north @entity217 , and got her major break when she went to work on veteran @entity107 competitor @entity17 's yard for 10 days in 2007 and was offered a full - time job as a rider			1

he and team mates @entity18 and @entity19 , 27 , today won gold - @entity2 's first ever @entity7 medal in the dressage			1
@entity73 , who now lives in @entity207 , said : ' i think that 's really fantastic			0
i 'm very proud of that place where i come from			0
i know those people are very excited to have an olympian from the @entity259			0
' he said people living on the island missed out on a visit from the @entity7 torch as it went on a relay around @entity2			1
' they were very upset that the flame did n't go to @entity270 when it went around the countryside , it went to @entity272 instead			0
well , if you come from @entity274 's a dirty word			0
it did n't go to my island and i was the one coming here			0
' so the fact that they now get a gold letterbox is just outstanding			0
i 'm very delighted that they 've recognised that and that 's where i come from , so hooray			0
' @entity285 , from @entity286 , told the @entity287 the post box will be transformed in the next few days			0
she said : ' this is the first time that @entity286 has changed the colour of @entity270 's post box since it was painted blue in 1980 , 11 years after the company became independent from the @entity293			2
' the plans for transforming @entity270 's post box are well under way and @entity286 hopes to have the post box finished in just a few days			0
' those unfamiliar with the world of dressage would be forgiven for wondering exactly what was happening today at @entity25			0
it may not look as challenging as the imposing fences on a cross-country course or possess the theatrical element of showjumping , but dressage is a highly technical discipline which demands huge skill and precision from both horse and rider			0
in the team event , the pair must ride two ' tests ' , with the rider memorising a series of movements that are performed in front of a set of judges			0
these are designed to put the horses through their paces and include complex manoeuvres such as a pirouette - where the animal effectively turns a full circle , with its hind - quarters at the centre			0
in other movements , the horse appears to ' skip ' across the arena			0
the objective is for the combination to work calmly together with top marks going to the most elegant and accurate partnerships			0
a mark out of 10 is awarded for each movement , with the total score shown as a percentage at the culmination of a test			0
the results for the three riders in each team are then added together			0
a final score is determined by combining the marks for the two tests			0
dressage has been an @entity7 sport since 1912			1
it was a discipline reserved for army officers until 1952 when it became a mixed event			0
the last seven @entity7 titles have been won by @entity4			1
@entity2 's equestrian team have been competing in iconic surroundings at @entity25			2

the gold - medal winning performance this afternoon means that @entity6 have now surpassed the 19 gold medals they bagged in @entity39
this year 's @entity6 is now the most successful since 1908
and it is the first time ever that @entity2 has won gold - or , indeed , any medal at all - in an @entity7 dressage competition
