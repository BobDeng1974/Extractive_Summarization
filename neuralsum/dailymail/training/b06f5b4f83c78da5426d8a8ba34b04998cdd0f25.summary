they were all still in their pyjamas and nighties when they were killed			1
' the @entity50 were killed in a flurry of @entity11 air strikes just over an hour before a ceasefire was due to temporarily halt the relentless bombardment of the @entity3			1
' it 's absolutely terrible			2
the school that the children attend is due to hold a ceremony to remember them			1
it is just so sad , ' said mr @entity12			2
' on the same day 26 others were killed			2
these are innocent people trying to go about their own lives			0
they have no connection with these killers			0
' the rest of the neighbourhood is so scared that people are afraid to even leave their homes			0
' i was born in this town , @entity16 , and it 's extremely worrying			1
it 's no longer the place it used to be			0
' it 's a constant worry , especially with the rest of my extended family living out there			0
how much more do these innocent people have to suffer ? ' they have cut off the water and electricity , meaning what lives they do have are affected			0
' i spoke to one relative the other day who had queued for three hours just to get ten litres			0
that is for the whole of his family			0

right , @entity96 , a cousin who was killed while trying to help the injured @entity11 's global standing has taken a nose dive after nearly 2,000 palestinians , mostly civilians , have been killed in the 27 days that its forces have waged war on the besieged territory			1
with public opinion turning against the jewish state , even the leaders of usually staunch allies such as the @entity109 , @entity5 and @entity110 have felt compelled to condemn attacks on un-run facilities which have offered sanctuary to @entity114 fleeing @entity11 bombs			2

@entity123 and mortar attacks from @entity3 have killed three @entity11 civilians during the current campaign			1
