the artificially intelligent robot called @entity7 , can create thousands of drinks at the touch of a button and learns how a user likes them - even anticipating when to make a drink with a double shot of alcohol in it after a long day at work to use the machine , which the company envisions being installed in a house , an individual must use the touch screen on the robot to browse the 300 - strong cocktail list and choose how strong they could like their drink , from ' lightweight ' to ' boss '			2
over time , the company says its intelligent machine will learn an individual 's taste to automatically per - adjust their drinks , as well as making them to order			0
the firm also says that just like a skilled human bartender , its robot can make recommendations based on their preferences and homeowners can pick a theme for their machine from @entity63 pub to @entity65 tiki bar			2
to use the machine , a user must use the touch screen on the robot to browse through the 300 - strong cocktail list and choose how strong they could like their drink , from ' lightweight ' to ' boss ' each of the 12 themes comprises 25 cocktails and @entity7 claims to be able to make 150 drinks without needing to top up on booze			0
however , when the ingredients do run out , the robot can send an email or text message to a local store to order more			0
using its ' personal butler feature ' the robot can tap into a @entity86 or @entity87 connection to know when its owner is at home			0
the robot is the brainchild of a company , also called @entity7 , in @entity19 , @entity20 , which is trying to raise $ 100,000 on crowd - funding website @entity21 to put the product , which is designed for the home , into production if they have a date scheduled , it can offer the man or woman a matching cocktail , or even mix a chosen celebratory tipple if its owner 's favourite sports team wins a fixture			1
