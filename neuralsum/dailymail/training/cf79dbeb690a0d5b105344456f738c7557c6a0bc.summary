@entity1 manager @entity0 believes once striker @entity2 finds his inner confidence he will be a real handful for @entity6 defences			1
the 24 - year - old , who was playing for @entity10 side @entity8 three and a half years ago , scored twice as the @entity1 came from 2 - 0 down to beat @entity11 3 - 2 at @entity12			1
he has now scored in @entity1 's last three matches - since @entity0 arrived from @entity14 - and his manager has high hopes for him			1
@entity2 struggles to contain his delight as he runs to celebrate his late winner with the travelling @entity1 fans ' he just seems a very uncomplicated player , ' he said			1
' he is very straightforward in his work ; he is quick , good in the air , good attitude - blimey there is not much more you want			2
' all he needs is experience and to grow in his confidence			2
' when i had @entity29 at @entity30 he was n't the player he is today			0
' because he has played in the @entity6 he has that inner confidence he can play at this level and that is what players like @entity2 need to find			1
' @entity1 striker @entity2 halves @entity11 's advantage with a clinical strike on saturday @entity29 was @entity1 's other goalscorer as they recovered from goals by @entity41 , from a corner , and @entity43 , who benefited from @entity44 out - muscling @entity45 on the touchline , in the opening 16 minutes			1
' i was disapponted in the first two goals , ' added @entity0			2
' i know the ball was n't in the quadrant ( corner ) for the first goal but that is a lame excuse , we should have done better			0
' the second goal was a foul and i think the referee and linesman were distracted by the fact was the ball in or out and did n't see the player just dump our defender on the pitch			0
' having said that we had to show tremendous qualities , not just fighting spirit and resilience - which i know is in the group - but flair and bravery to pass the ball which we did against a @entity11 team who i thought were on their mettle			1
' @entity2 celebrates his second and @entity1 's third as @entity0 's side fight back from two - goals down @entity11 boss @entity77 disagreed with his counterpart as , despite their early lead , he felt his players were not at their best and that is what cost them			1
' we got a 2 - 0 lead and i did n't really feel comfortable with how the team was performing , ' he said			2
' we did n't start particularly well and we looked slightly off all the details we do well and if you do n't do them well enough you will get hurt			0
' it is probably a bit harsh on us to lose the game but they did well enough to win it and we 've done that to other teams			0
' i said to them afterwards if you come one per cent off the performance levels then you are not guaranteed anything , you have to play hard all the time , and we were just off and just off it too far for us at this level of football			0
' the hardest thing in management is to snap teams out of that performance level when they are just below par. ' you can do it when there are two or three but when it is five or six it is more difficult			0
' it was n't a radically poor performance but they were just off their levels and for a team which is learning you ca n't afford to do that			0

@entity2 has scored in all three games since @entity0 took over at @entity1
the 24 - year - old was playing for @entity10 side @entity8 three years ago
@entity11 boss @entity77 felt his players were not at their best in 3 - 2 loss
