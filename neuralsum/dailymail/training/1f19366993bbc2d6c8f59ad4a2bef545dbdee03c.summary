number one fan : @entity10 lineman @entity9 proves he 's not a tax whiz as he lets out a stream of frustration on the @entity5 building in @entity18 perhaps @entity9 thought he would turn the tables on the government and take a leak on them ? though he ’s in the act of what could easily constitute a federal crime , @entity9 was unconcerned about showing the world his moment of defiance			1

and on @entity49 , @ @entity53 wrote , ‘ @entity9 will be apologizing later today			1
’ to which @entity9 replied : ‘ how high we counting ? ’ it is unclear if @entity9 was actually urinating on the building or if a tell - tale wet spot seen in the photo was merely a shadow			2
