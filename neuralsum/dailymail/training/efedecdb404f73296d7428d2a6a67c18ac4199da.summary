@entity131 , 72 , who also lives in the street , said she had been told the lane had been named after a woman called @entity96 used to sit at the top of the road knitting			2
ms @entity131 moved from the south of the country to the @entity70 road in 2007 and said the cheapness of the property attracted her and her partner , but added it did not seem any less expensive than others in the area			0
asked if she was bothered by the potentially embarrassing street name , she said : ' we just did n’t take any notice			2
' you get people stopping at the top and taking pictures of the road sign but it does n’t bother me			0
