a party celebrating martin luther king , jr day called ' @entity2 ' has been cancelled after a poster promoting the event caused outrage			1
a @entity7 party promotor called @entity8 photoshopped dr @entity1 's head onto the body of a man wearing a heavy gold medallion and throwing a gang sign			1
the freedom to twerk was decidedly not one of @entity1 's civil rights dreams and the use of his image offended many in the community , especially his descendants			2
wrong message : the organizers of the freedom to @entity2 party used dr @entity1 , @entity1 's head superimposed on another man 's body @entity28 , daughter of the late civil rights icon , called the poster ' appalling ' and ' almost embarrassing ' in an interview with @entity33			1
' i lost a father who sacrificed everything for them to live a much more dignified and respectful life , ' she said			0
' and for it to come to this just makes me sad			0
' it 's not the first promotional poster to appropriate dr @entity1 's image for profit			1
a flyer for a @entity48 strip club featuring dr @entity1 with a wad of cash standing next to a scantily clad woman earned its creator flack in 2012			1
and last year 's ' @entity58 , ' @entity56 ' and ' @entity57 , ' the latter of which featured dr @entity1 in a pair of headphones and flanked by @entity61 and yet another scantily clad woman , all came in for criticism			2
misrepresentation : party posters like this that use dr @entity1 , @entity1 's image are ' almost embarrassing , ' says @entity1 's daughter ' appalling ' : @entity28 says her father sacrificed everything so that people could live with dignity and respect and hopes this is a ' teachable moment ' the owner of the venue where the freedom to @entity2 party @entity80 was to be held has said he was not consulted about the advertising materials			1
' we have since cancelled said event , refunded the promotor 's deposit and informed the group that they will no longer be welcome at our establishment , ' he said in a statement to @entity33			2
' as an @entity94 man who owns a business , i have a lot of responsibility , ' @entity91 said , according to the @entity98			0
' this is about his legacy			0
dr. @entity1 has done way too much for this country , or me , or anyone , to allow this to go on			0
' missing the point : another martin luther king , jr day party , another unauthorized image of the icon leader : dr @entity1 , @entity1 won the @entity109 in 1964 and was assassinated four years later @entity80 has now planned his own martin luther king day party that will truly honor @entity109 winner			1
the @entity113 ' aims to ' bring about social awareness and youth participation as it pertains to dr @entity1 's legacy			2
' new plan : the @entity118 and @entity119 has organized its own @entity1 , @entity121 event on the @entity118 's @entity127 page , @entity122 , who brought the poster to the business 's attention , said she was glad they cancelled the party			1
' please know that i stand proudly and supportive behind your decision and hope that profit never supersedes respect for these party promoters , ' she said			0
' they can twerk if they choose to , but leave the deceased civil rights @entity109 legacy to rest respectfully in peace			0
' dr @entity28 says she does n't believe the poster was malicious , just ignorant , and hopes the incident will prove to be a ' teachable moment			0
' ' we can begin the process of educating them and helping them to see how this is insulting and how this is not truly representative of dr @entity1			2
' the civil rights leader would have turned 85 last week .			0
