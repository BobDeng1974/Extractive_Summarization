ms @entity4 is one of the growing number of @entity14 who are dressing up in hand - made costumes of their favourite comic book , television show or movie characters in the name of cosplay - a trend that has exploded online and at conventions across the globe			1

she 's my signature character and eventually , i 'm working my way through all of her costumes			2
but i also love group @entity40 which is when a bunch of us get together and have a theme like the walking dead and we 'll go to a convention and just walk around the floor being those characters , ' ms @entity38 told @entity47			0
' i got into cosplay about three years ago , which is not long considering i 've been going to conventions since i was little , but i had no crafting skills			2
then i discovered there are all these tutorials online and on social media - all these ways of accessing information on how to make costumes and i thought : if i 'm going to learn to sew , then i 'm going to learn to sew @entity8			2
' countless hours and hundreds of dollars have gone into some of her costumes , but ms @entity60 said many cosplay costume makers prided themselves on spending under $ 10 on a single costume - ripping apart old ones and including things they had around the house - while others fork our thousands of dollars for the perfect materials			2
ms @entity4 says she chose @entity8 as her signature - with each costume taking up to six weeks to make - because of her empowering character and ' compassion '			1
' she always leans towards non-violence first and is very diplomatic - for example one of her weapons is her lasso of truth			0
she 's a fantastic role model for younger girls and i do a lot of charity events dressed as her , like hospital visits for disabled and underprivileged children where we just rock up and brighten up their day			0
it took her six weeks to create her @entity8 outift , but she says she plans to work her way through all of the super hero 's costumes ms @entity4 said that what was once considered traditionally ' geeky ' has become quite mainstream , with more and more @entity14 connecting to cosplay stars online ' but i also love group @entity40 which is when a bunch of us get together and have a theme like the walking dead and we 'll go to a convention and just walk around the floor being those characters , ' ms @entity38 , dressed as @entity96 's @entity11 , added ' but one of my all - time favourite experiences was at @entity104 convention when i had a little girl come up to me and she was shaking because she thought i was the real life @entity8 and it was just incredible - that meant the world to her			1
' with a combined social media following of 25,000 fans , ms @entity4 is lined up to host the cosplay championships at this year 's @entity113 - the official @entity14 version of the internationally renowned pop culture convention , the @entity33 , which saw over 130,000 guests attend in 2014			1
meanwhile both @entity117 and @entity118 are expecting over 20,000 people to attend their separate events this year			1

ms @entity4 says she chose @entity8 as her signature - with each costume taking up to six weeks to make - because of her empowering character and ' compassion ' : ' she always leans towards non-violence first and is very diplomatic - for example one of her weapons is her lasso of truth ' spray painting and cutting knee pads and shoulder armour : ' some cosplayers have started working as consultants for video game companies who want to design their character 's costumes so that they are easily replicated in real life because they 've recognised cosplay as a massive marketing strategy , ' ms @entity4 said the journalist ( pictured dressed as @entity96 's @entity149 ) visits children 's hospitals dressed as @entity8 to ' brighten their day ' ' some people do it because they love getting into character and walking around a convention floor			1
for some it 's about the crafting of the costume			0
for others , it 's about being part of the community , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' it 's a huge ice breaker for making friends			0
the thing about the geek community is we have a lot of introverts - we do n't have a lot of people who would walk around introducing themselves , but if your dressed as the doctor [ from @entity175 ] and so is someone from across the room - they might walk up to you and ask how you made elements of your costume			2
i 've met some of my best friends at various conventions because we share the same passion and fandoms			0
' people can make a career out of it too			0
some cosplayers have started working as consultants for video game companies who want to design their character 's costumes so that they are easily replicated in real life because they 've recognised cosplay as a massive marketing strategy			0
it means that it 's more likely to be made by someone and seen on a convention floor and that 's a huge draw card for people to start talking about that particular game			0
