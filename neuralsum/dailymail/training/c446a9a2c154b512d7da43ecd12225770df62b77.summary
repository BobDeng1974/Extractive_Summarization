by @entity0 some could spend all day walking among extinct , wild and giant animals in a natural history museum			0
but for this man , that does n't quite cut it			0
@entity6 is going to climb inside the carcass of a grizzly bear - and stay there for 13 days			1
isolation : @entity6 climbed into the grizzly bear at the @entity12 in @entity13 today crammed inside a space measuring just half a square metre , he will eat , drink , sleep and relieve himself while being filmed by two cameras			1
the project , @entity19 ( inside the skin of the @entity21 ) , is a visual performance designed to make visitors to the @entity12 in @entity13 think about ' rebirth and the rite of passage '			1
inspired by carcasses he encountered in the @entity28 , mr @entity6 's bear is partly reconstructed to accommodate for his needs , and then covered by the original skin and fur			2
director of the museum @entity34 is delighted by the exhibition , which started when mr @entity6 climbed inside at 11am this morning			1
mr @entity34 told @entity36 : ' it is very interesting and our visitors are very excited			0
he has just half a square metre of space , and will only eat food a bear would such as insects and worms for exercise , he has two rubber exercise bands and some space near his feet where he can stretch out ' he had to work for a long time perfecting his menu to work out what could be kept in there , and working out a way he can get some exercise			1
' he has to live in total isolation and be totally self - sufficient in a space not dissimilar from what an astronaut would experience in a rocket			0
it will be very very difficult for him			0
' we have worked with him as well to come up with books for him to read while he is in there			2
' inside he has some more light - hearted books , a bit of escapism			2
on a table outside , we have a set of books relating to his experience like @entity72 by @entity73			0
the abstract artist was inspired by carcasses he saw in the @entity28 , and wants visitors to think about rebirth necessities : two of the legs will store water to sustain him until april 13 , the other two will act as his toilet ' visitors can hold it up to the eyes , and he can read it from inside			1
' it is very exciting			0
' having excavated the bear structure , mr @entity6 has filled up two of the legs with enough water to sustain him until april 13			1
the other two legs will be his toilet			0
alongside a kettle , he has a selection of foods that a bear would eat , including dried fruits , insects , and worms			1
@entity34 , director of the museum , described mr @entity6 as a man ' familiar with extreme situations ' visitors will be able to sit by mr @entity6 and hold books to the bear 's eyes which he can see through the abstract artist , who has previously lived in a hole underground for a week , will spend the entire time sat semi-upright in a chair			1
for movement , he has rubber exercise bands and some room by his feet to stretch			0
describing mr @entity6 as a man ' familiar with extreme situations ' , mr @entity34 said : ' he has already attracted a crowd of people			2
everyone wants to go near a big grizzly anyway , and this is even more intriguing for them			0

@entity6 climbed into grizzly today , will stay until april 13
will eat , sleep , relieve himself inside bear at @entity128 in @entity13
only has food a bear would eat including worms , insects and dried fruit
