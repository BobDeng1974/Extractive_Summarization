a compound emitted by mould can be linked to the development of @entity4 , researchers believe a damp , mouldy house has long been known to trigger asthma and allergies - and new research has now linked it to an increased risk of @entity4			1
scientists found a compound emitted by mould can be linked to the development of the neurological condition			2
the @entity16 researchers found a connection between the compound given off by mould and mildew - a vapour known as ' mushroom alcohol ' – and the malfunctioning of two genes associated with the brain chemical dopamine			1
this is lost in patients with @entity4			2
while the condition has previously been linked to exposure to toxins , these were man - made rather than natural chemicals , said researcher dr @entity32 , from @entity33			0
the idea for the research came from the study 's co-author dr @entity36 , also from @entity33 , who became interested in the health effects of living in a damp building after her house was flooded when @entity41 struck @entity42 in 2005			0
after her house flooded it became riddled with moulds and dr @entity44 started to collect samples wearing protective clothing			0
she said : ‘ i felt horrible – headaches , dizziness , nausea			0
i knew something about “ sick building syndrome ” but until then i did n’t believe in it			0
‘ i did n’t think it would be possible to breathe in enough mould spores to get sick			0
’ as a result of this experience , dr @entity44 decided to investigate the connection between moulds and the symptoms she had experienced			0
she and dr @entity32 discovered that the volatile organic compound 1 - octen - 3 - ol , otherwise known as mushroom alcohol , can cause movement disorders in fruit flies			1
researchers found a connection between a compound - popularly known as mushroom alcohol - and the malfunctioning of two genes involved in the packaging and transport of dopamine , the chemical released by nerve cells to send messages to other nerve cells in the brain			1
image shows a scan of a brain with @entity4 's they also found that it attacks the two genes that deal with dopamine , degenerating the neurones and causing @entity4 ’s - like symptoms			1
parkinson 's disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine are slowly destroyed			1
without dopamine , the nerve cells in that part of the brain can not properly send messages			1
parkinson 's disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine are slowly destroyed			1
without dopamine , the nerve cells in that part of the brain can not properly send messages			1
it is a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremor , muscular rigidity and slow , imprecise movement			0
many people with @entity4 's also suffer from depression , daytime sleepiness and difficulty swallowing			1
there is no cure for the condition but there are some drug treatments which can be beneficial temporarily			0
about one in 500 people develop parkinson 's disease and there are currently 127,000 people in the @entity115 with the condition			1
the average age for the symptoms to develop is about 60 , although one in 20 cases first develop in people under the age of 50			0
men are one and a half times more likely to get @entity4 's than women			1
white people are much more likely to get it than black and @entity126 people			0
source : @entity128 studies indicate that the condition - a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremor , muscular rigidity and slow , imprecise movement - is increasing in rural areas , where it ’s usually attributed to pesticide exposure			2
but rural environments also have a lot of mould and mushroom exposure			2
‘ our work suggests that 1 - octen - 3 - ol might also be connected to the disease , particularly for people with a genetic susceptibility to it , ’ dr @entity32 said			2
‘ we ’ve given the epidemiologists some new avenues to explore			0
’ @entity152 , @entity153 at @entity154 , said : ‘ understanding what causes @entity4 ’s remains one of the big unanswered questions for researchers today			2
‘ we already know that exposure to some chemicals can slightly increase the risk of @entity4 's , and this is the first study to suggest that chemicals produced by fungi may play a part in what causes the condition to develop			2
‘ it is important to remember this study was conducted using tiny fruit flies , so before we can really be confident about this new connection we need to see evidence from studies in people			0
‘ whilst exposure to chemicals produced by fungi – and possibly other chemicals – may play a role in @entity4 's in some people , it 's likely just a small part of a much bigger puzzle and we would n’t want people to worry unnecessarily about developing the condition if they found mold or fungi in their homes			1
‘ we still do n't know exactly what causes @entity4 's – for most people it 's likely to be a combination of natural ageing , genetic susceptibility , lifestyle and environmental factors			1
’ the findings , which were produced with help from researchers at @entity196 , were published online in the @entity197 and the study was funded by @entity33 and the @entity199 .			0

some mould emits a compound or vapour known as ' mushroom alcohol '
can cause two genes involved in the transport of dopamine to malfunction
dopamine is the chemical released by nerve cells to send messages to other nerve cells in the brain - and is lost in people with @entity4 's disease
