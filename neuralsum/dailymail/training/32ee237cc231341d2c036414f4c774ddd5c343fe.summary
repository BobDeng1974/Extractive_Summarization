by @entity0 published : 23:16 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 23:30 est , 11 january 2013 crackdown : mayor @entity1 , right , announced the crackdown on prescription drugs in @entity4 on thursday at a press conference , pictured @entity4 mayor @entity1 has launched a crackdown on prescription drugs and said patients who genuinely need painkillers might have to ' suffer a little bit ' to get the citywide addiction ' epidemic ' under control			1
@entity14 announced the plan , which will sharply restrict some of the most common and most powerful painkillers from emergency rooms in the city 's 11 hospitals , yesterday			1
but it was immediately met with harsh criticism , with doctors claiming it would penalize the poor			1
however , the mayor was not swayed , claiming , on his weekly radio show , that there was ' no evidence ' underprivileged and uninsured patients would be worse off and if they were they could ' suffer ' for the greater good			1
' the city hospitals we control , so ... we 're going to do it and we 're urging all of the other hospitals to do it , ' he said , according to @entity37			2
' somebody said ... " oh then maybe there wo n't be enough painkillers for the poor who use the emergency rooms as their primary care doctor			1
" ' @entity45 , there 's no evidence of that			2
number two , supposing it is really true , so you did n't get enough painkillers and you did have to suffer a little bit			2
the other side of the coin is people are dying and there 's nothing perfect ... there 's nothing that you can possibly do where somebody is n't going to suffer , and it 's always the same group ( claiming ) , " everybody is heartless			2
" come on , this is a very big problem			0
' under the new city policy , most public hospital patients will no longer be able to get more than three days ' worth of narcotic painkillers like @entity69 and @entity70			2
long - acting painkillers , including @entity72 , which is often used to ease chronic backache and arthritis , as well as @entity76 patches and methadone , will not be dispensed at all			0
not available : long - acting painkillers , including @entity72 , which is often used to ease chronic backache and arthritis , as well as @entity76 patches , pictured , and methadone , will not be dispensed at all @entity1 added on thursday that lost , stolen or destroyed prescriptions will not be refilled under the plan to crack down on what he called a citywide and national epidemic of prescription drug abuse			1
on the radio show he said the initiative was also about preventing excess amounts of drugs being taken out of medicine cabinets and sold on the street or abused by teenagers and others who want to get high			0
' we talk about drugs , heroin and crack and marijuana , this is one of the big outbursts â€“ and it 's a lot worse around the country than it is here , ' he said			2
' it 's kids and adults getting painkillers and using them for entertainment purposes , or whatever field of purposes , as opposed to what they are designed for			0
' if you break a leg , you 're going to be in pain , nothing wrong with getting something that reduces the pain			0
but if you get 20 days worth of pills and you only need them three days , there 's 17 days sitting there			0
invariably some of the kids are going to find them , or you 're going to take them and get you addicted			0
' three days : under the new city policy , most public hospital patients will no longer be able to get more than three days ' worth of narcotic painkillers like @entity69 , pictured in generic form , and @entity70 @entity1 also claimed the over-prescription of painkillers in @entity4 had contributed to an increase in violent crimes outside pharmacies as robbers tried to steal the drugs			1
' you see there 's a lot more hold - ups of pharmacies , people getting held up as they walk out of pharmacies , ' he said in his radio slot			0
' what are they all about ? they 're not trying to steal your shaving cream or toothpaste at the point of a gun			0
' after thursday 's announcements , critics slammed the initiative claiming poor and uninsured patients who used the emergency room as their primary source of care could be worse off			1
' here is my problem with legislative medicine , ' dr @entity162 , president - elect of the @entity163 and senior vice chairman of emergency medicine at @entity166 in @entity167 told @entity172			0
' it prevents me from being a professional and using my judgment			0
' he suggested the glut of prescription drugs was probably coming to @entity4 from pain clinics in states such as @entity181 and @entity182 rather than local emergency rooms			1
but @entity1 insisted the abuse of prescription painkillers had ' increased alarmingly ' with more than 250,000 @entity4 over age 12 now addicted , and that tackling the ' very big problem ' was the most important thing .			1
