by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the big players have parked their tanks on @entity5 ’s lawns , with @entity6 and @entity7 both declaring that they are fit and ready to fire over the next fortnight			1
the top two seeds issued upbeat assessments of their chances yesterday , with the @entity12 insisting his wrist is fine and world @entity16 believing he is equipped to avoid the shock exits that have befallen him since 2011			2
@entity6 missed last month ’s @entity18 with soreness in his wrist that first appeared at the start of the clay court season and he pulled out of his regular @entity23 exhibition at @entity24 on thursday as a precaution			0
champion : @entity27 prepares to defend his title at @entity5 - but the rest of the ' @entity30 ' are ready too look over your shoulder : @entity27 has a whole host of rivals who have their eye on his @entity5 crown he feels going into @entity5 without any preparation on grass has been a price worth paying because easing himself in appears to have cured the problem			1
he said : ‘ when i was changing surfaces from clay to grass , during the opening few days of practice here , i got a bit of a strange sensation in the wrist			2
but now it ’s fine			0
’ while @entity6 has been staggeringly consistent at the @entity51 — he has not lost before the quarter - finals since the @entity53 five years ago — @entity7 has become prone to upsets on the grass			1
the @entity12 took some time off in @entity56 after @entity53 , while @entity7 had some downtime at home in @entity59 before coming to @entity60 last wednesday			1
they both feel it is the right formula for success and in the @entity65 ’s case he believes it will lead to him sticking around longer			1
@entity7 is so confident about the state of his body he has stepped up his preparations from previous visits to the @entity71			1
watchful eye : djokovic practices watched over by his coach @entity74 as he limbers up at @entity75 ‘ i ’m practising more hours than i usually do , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s positive that my physical level gives me that chance because this is the only tournament where you do n’t have weeks of matches to understand how you are playing			0
‘ it ’s the most dangerous tournament of the year			0
when i arrive at @entity53 i can more or less imagine how i am going to play			0
here the courts are a bit faster at the start and the feeling on court is a little strange for everybody			2
’ @entity7 has the toughest initial draw of any top player , facing the useful @entity92 @entity91 in the first round , then possibly his 2012 conqueror @entity94 and potentially the giant - serving @entity96			1
he dismissed any significance in his loss 10 days ago against @entity99 in @entity100 , saying : ‘ i am feeling better this year than the past couple			2
i am able to move more freely , i ’m not scared about my knee and that is the most important thing for me			0
‘ i did n’t play as much as i would like to play on grass for the last couple of years but i am not starting from zero because i have already played a lot on it in my career			2
‘ but you do n’t have much time to control a match on grass , you make two mistakes on your serve and you do n’t have much chance to get it back			0
’ chilled : @entity7 has been out practicing on the outer courts at @entity5 as he sets his sights on glory not wishing to be outdone , @entity118 was also in confident mood			1
the great @entity120 , who won the @entity124 @entity123 event at @entity125 , is the fourth favourite for this event as he approaches his 33rd birthday but he questions the relevance of that			1
‘ i do n’t know if it changes a whole lot , ’ he said			0
‘ sometimes i was the big favourite but if you believe you can win the tournament then you ’re just focused on yourself			0
’ he lost in the second round last year against @entity137 but now feels able to joke about that result			0
‘ we can only face each other in the final this year — so it ’s all good for both of us , ’ he says			0
crucially he believes more in himself at @entity5 : ‘ maybe in @entity144 it ’s slightly dependent on @entity7			2
here i feel if i play my game then it ’s more on my racket			0
’ do n't forget me ! @entity118 may be fourth favourite but he is still a tough opponent on grass			1
