by @entity0 two chimpanzees at a @entity3 zoo celebrated their birthday by tearing into presents and gorging on a giant cake			1
the chimpanzees , based at @entity8 in @entity9 , tucked into a giant cardboard cake containing their favourite treats such as bananas and grapes			1
the hairy pair , named @entity15 and @entity16 after the @entity17 from @entity18 , were also given colourfully wrapped presents by zookeepers			1
zookeeper @entity40 said , ' both @entity15 and @entity16 love investigating new things , so the party was an excellent way to encourage their natural inquisitive behaviours and celebrate their 18th birthday			1
' the other chimpanzees at the zoo - @entity47 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 - were also invited to the primates ' birthday bash , and the whole troop was visibly grinning as they ripped into the cake and presents			2
' everyone at @entity58 has a soft spot for the mischievous duo			0
they are often seen chasing one another around like rowdy teenagers , ' said @entity40			0
' @entity16 is known as a bit of a greedy chimp			2
he loves being the centre of attention and trying to get his hands on more of his favourite treats , especially bananas , grapes and monkey nuts			2
' @entity15 is the smaller and shyer of the two			0
he can often be seen swinging from ropes in the @entity75 ’s " chimpnasium "			0
' now where to begin ? the chimpanzee stares wonderingly at the giant cake surrounded by presents given to him by his keepers yay , grapes ! one of the chimps scoops his favourite fruit from the giant cardboard ' cake ' check this out ! @entity15 and @entity16 invite their friends to share in the spoils i think i 'll take ... this one : one of the chimps makes off with a particularly shiny - looking present , and a second one just to make sure @entity15 and @entity16 were named after @entity96 ’s most notorious duo by @entity18 actress @entity97 when she visited the zoo in 1996.the two apes are not actually brothers , but both were born on the same day			1
the life expectancy of a chimpanzee is approximately 45 to 50 years of age , so they will have plenty of other opportunities to unwrap presents			0
and they seem to like it so much , chimps at @entity8 have previously been given gifts on @entity113 and at @entity114 .			0
