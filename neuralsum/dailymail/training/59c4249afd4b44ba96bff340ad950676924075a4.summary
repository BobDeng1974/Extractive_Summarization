if @entity1 had asked for a new contract six months ago , you would have heard the groans from @entity5 fans all the way down to his native @entity7 in @entity8			1
it was only a man - of - the - match performance against @entity10 on march 15 following @entity12 ’s dismissal that belatedly gave @entity5 fans a glimpse of the real @entity1 , who had previously looked slow , cumbersome and earned a red card against @entity16 that killed @entity5 ’s @entity18 prospects			1
since then , he ’s hardly put a foot wrong from playing in a @entity21 final for @entity8 to scoring @entity5 ’s crucial equaliser at @entity23 on saturday			2
@entity1 has grown into playing centre - half for @entity5 over the last six months the @entity25 had an excellent @entity21 and was a standout performer for the runners - up @entity1 was a rock at the back for @entity5 during their 2 - 2 draw against @entity23 on saturday so , when at the age of 34 and on the eve or a return to his former club @entity36 whom @entity5 face in the @entity18 on wednesday night , @entity1 hints he ’d expect a renewal of his contract when it runs out this summer , the reaction from fans is wholehearted agreement rather than laughter			1
after all , @entity1 has played so well alongside @entity12 this season , @entity44 ’s £ 32million marquee summer signing @entity45 has n’t been given a look in so far			1
he may have chopped off his ponytail for the @entity21 but unlike @entity50 , it has n’t mean losing any of his strength			0
@entity1 is following in a long line of centre - halves from @entity55 ’s @entity54 to @entity56 at @entity23 who have suffered terrible starts with new clubs before winning fans over and being fondly remembered			2
@entity44 , who also had him at @entity60 , wo n’t be surprised in the transformation			2
he ’s always claimed @entity1 ‘ is a very important player for us			2
’ @entity1 is set to be handed a new contract by @entity44 at the @entity65 the 34 - year - old 's luck changed during a sterling performance against @entity10 back in march the @entity5 boss keeps his cards too close to his chest to explain exactly why , but in a @entity76 interview , @entity16 and @entity73 legend @entity72 , who faced @entity1 many times , offered an insight			1
‘ @entity1 has been criticised but he can bring the ball out well from the back in order to get the team playing football			2
that is want @entity44 wants to do , ’ said @entity72			0
a commanding figure who is good on the ball and in the air , @entity1 ’s form was noted back home in @entity90 , leading to his @entity21 call up with manager @entity91 saying : ‘ he had a great season in the @entity95 league which is extremely difficult competitive and physical			1
he responded well and i could not afford to leave him out , ’ said @entity91			0
and while some players have suffered @entity99 hangovers , @entity1 has taken off this season where he left off			0
hence his appeal to be given a new deal by the club , who have already signed up @entity12 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			1
@entity12 was awarded a new five - year contract by the @entity110 champions last month @entity106 has also committed himself to @entity5 for the foreseeable future ‘ i am playing every game , every two to three days , ’ said the popular defender			1
‘ i would be happy to stay this year and then one more year because i think i will still have the quality to play at this level			0
’ ‘ the people who criticised me need to be more respectful of me and what i have done in my career			0
’ that career includes a @entity18 final appearance for @entity36 although they lost to @entity122 ’s @entity121			0
it will be a special return for him in the @entity125 on wednesday , where @entity5 won last season in the group stages though @entity44 was criticised for not knowing one more goal would have allowed them to win the group and avoid @entity16 in the last - 16			1
last season he took part in a television documentary about @entity5 where he publicly stated his desire to play one day in @entity90 ’s mls			0
at the time , @entity5 would have paid for his air ticket			0
now it appears , his plans to go stateside have been put on hold .			0

@entity44 has shown great faith in @entity1
the @entity25 's @entity5 luck changed against @entity10 in march
@entity1 is expected to be handed a new contract at the @entity65
@entity106 , @entity105 and @entity12 have *penned* new deals
