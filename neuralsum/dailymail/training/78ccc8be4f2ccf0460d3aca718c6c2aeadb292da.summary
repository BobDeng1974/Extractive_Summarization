if it seems you are permanently single while everyone around you is in a relationship , blame your dna			0
scientists have identified a ' singleton gene '			1
those who have it are 20 per cent more likely to be single than others			0
it is thought that by lowering levels of the feel - good brain chemical serotonin , the gene makes people less comfortable in close relationships			1
this could make it harder to form them in the first place – or lead to break - up after break - up			2
scientists have identified a ' singleton gene ' , so if you find yourself often without a significant other , like @entity24 , played by @entity25 ( pictured ) , blame your dna the scientists tested hair samples from almost 600 @entity28 university students to analyse a gene called 5 - @entity30 which comes in two different versions			1
those with the ' g ' version were much more likely to be single than those with the ' c ' version			0
some 60 per cent were not in a relationship – compared to 50 per cent of those in the ' @entity37			0
importantly , the link could n't be explained away other factors that influence relationships , including appearance and wealth			2
it is thought that by lowering levels of the feel - good brain chemical serotonin , the gene makes people less comfortable in close relationships the key to the finding seems to be the role of the 5 - @entity30 gene in the brain			1
those with the ' g ' , or singleton , version , make less of serotonin , a brain chemical involved in mood and happiness			1
it was already known that people with the ' g ' allele , or version , find it more difficult to get close to others			2
plus , they are more likely to be neurotic and to suffer from depression			1
writing in the journal @entity70 , the researchers said : ' as pessimism and neuroticism are detrimental to the formation , quality and stability of relationships , this connection between the @entity55 allele and psychological disorders might decrease carriers ' dating opportunities or lead to romantic relationship failure			2
' the @entity84 researchers said that students may have more free time and freedom to form relationships that others			1
and at other times of life , other factors , such as pressure from parents to marry , may be much more influential			0
despite this , they concluded that their study provides ' evidence for genetic contribution to social relationships in certain contexts '			2
other scientists said that while genes will inevitably influence relationships , their role in most cases will be small			1
dr @entity107 , a relationship expert , said that we do n't have to let our genes rule our lives			0
she said : ' i know that our genetic heritage determines some of our behaviour but we always have choice			0
' if someone 's difficulties with dating are flagged up to them , i believe they can learn to interact in a way that will make them more successful in meeting somebody			0
' i feel quite optimistic about that			0

scientists have identified a ' singleton gene ' which lowers level of serotonin
reduced feel - good chemical makes people *shy* away from relationships
it also makes them more likely to be neurotic and to suffer from depression
hair samples from almost 600 @entity28 university students were tested
