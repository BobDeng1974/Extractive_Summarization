by @entity0 a new doll , which depicts an anatomically correct baby boy complete with penis and testicles , has divided @entity6 parents with some claiming it is inappropriate			1
the @entity9 doll , sold by @entity10 , makes slurping sounds when he is fed through his bottle and cries when he wets his nappy , only stopping when he is changed			1
but it is the realistic depiction of his genitals that has parents up in arms and it seems that parents are divided roughly along gendered lines , with fathers strongly objecting to the doll , while mothers have no problem with it			1
angry : @entity28 from @entity10 has some parents frowning a post about the doll on an online mother 's group generated more than 300 comments in less than 24 hours			1
in the original post , @entity35 shared a picture of the doll , with the caption : ' i just showed my partner this doll and asked him if he would let our daughter play with it			2
he says no. what do your partners think ? ' overwhelming the mothers were in favour of the doll , describing it as ' natural ' and long overdue , whereas many women said their partners objected to the doll			1
' i just showed my partner he said no way [ our daughter ] does n't need to know about boys until she is 30 , ' wrote @entity61			0
' i just asked hubby and his reply was no ! ! i said " why ? " and he said " because it 's f * * * ing gross ! ! " ' wrote @entity65			0
the original doll ( left ) to wet itself like a real baby is @entity70 invented in 1935 and the new anatomically correct modern version ( right ) one woman said her partner blamed doll such as this one for the premature sexualisation of children			2
' my partner said it 's not necessary ! no need to have a little girl touching a doll willy			2
he thinks that 's why so many young kids are sexually active younger these days because parents let their children " see more "			0
' dr @entity86 from the @entity87 at the @entity88 says those fears are almost certainly unfounded			0
would you let your child play with this anatomically correct doll ? ' the counter-argument that girls will interact with these dolls in a sexual way is a pretty weak argument , we do n't have any research to support that , unless they 're in an environment where an adult is interacting with it in a sexual way , ' she told @entity106			2
' gender is a normal part of life , anatomically different parts of our body are a normal part of life , and children learn that from a very early age , we 're not telling them something they do n't know already			0
' and as one mother wrote , this is not the first anatomically correct male doll to cause controversy			1
' i had â€¦ the boy baby born growing up and my uncle did n't agree so he cut its doodle off			0
my kids both have one [ and ] i 'm fully okay with it , ' wrote @entity128 on the online forum			0
the first anatomically correct male doll , the @entity133 's @entity132 doll , was created in 1976 and is still available for purchase on @entity135			1
the first doll to wet its nappy was the @entity138 doll , created in the 1930s .			0

the @entity141 is sold at @entity10
the male doll has a penis and has caused shock in some parenting groups
in many cases mothers find the doll *harmless* , whereas fathers object to it
