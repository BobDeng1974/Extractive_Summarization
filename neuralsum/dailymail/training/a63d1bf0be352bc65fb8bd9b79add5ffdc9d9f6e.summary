@entity0 admitted that @entity1 ' did not play as a team ' and bemoaned @entity1 's lack of top quality defenders following the shock defeat against @entity6 on his competitive debut at @entity8			1
@entity9 became the first @entity1 manager to lose a home @entity12 match on the opening day of the season after goals from @entity17 and @entity18 stunned a home crowd expecting life under the @entity21 to be a big improvement on last season 's woes			1
the 63 - year - old former @entity26 and @entity27 boss was even forced to ditch his much - hyped 3 - 5 - 2 formation at half - time with @entity1 struggling to create any chances			1
the team switched to a flat back four which included @entity32 and @entity33 in central defence , @entity35 at left back and @entity36 at right back			0
' we need defenders , ' @entity9 told @entity55 after the match			0
' you can not say because of one game we lost that it ( the problem ) is the defence - it is the team			2
we did n't play as a team			0
' we do n't reach our level what we have shown in pre-season			0
we are disappointing in defence			0
debut despair : @entity32 made his first @entity12 start for @entity1 against @entity6 @entity9 added : ' we are not reaching our level in our first home match and that is disappointing because this is the most important match , we must evaluate			1
' ' they have done their utmost best and you can see in the second half they have run the miles			2
' we must keep our head up and use the second step in our process better than today			0
' we were disappointing in defence and we are disappointed with ourselves and that 's why we lost today			2
' tall order : @entity33 was unable to prevent @entity1 losing and conceding two goals @entity9 would not divulge which players he wants to move on before the transfer window closes at the end of august			1
instead he challenged his squad to prove they deserve a place in his regime at @entity8			1
' i have not made a decision on who goes - it is up to the players to decide too			2
i will never say to the players that you have to go			0
' explaining his decision to change from his favoured 3 - 5 - 2 shape , @entity9 said : ' i had decided to change formation in the first half because @entity6 made the pitch big and 4 - 3 - 3 is a better formation to press with			1
' the @entity21 boss , who has won league titles with every club side he has managed so far in his career , quickly batted away suggestions that the opening - day performance will have a big impact on his transfer plans			1
@entity6 delight : @entity18 celebrates after scoring from close range ' no , because that is a short term assault i think , but of course we need defenders but i have already said that in former press conferences , ' he added			2
' you can not say because of one game that we lost , and all the others we won , that it is the defence			0
' we never played as a team i think and that 's our error and also we do n't reach the required level and maybe because of that we have n't played like a team			0
