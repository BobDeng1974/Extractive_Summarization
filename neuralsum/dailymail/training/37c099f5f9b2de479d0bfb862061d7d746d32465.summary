@entity0 still has designs on this year 's formula one world title , although appreciates his hopes are now ' distant '			1
back - to - back victories either side of the summer break , as he took advantage of @entity9 duo @entity8 and @entity10 tripping over themselves , had propelled @entity0 into contention			1
but around the lightning - fast , low - downforce @entity15 circuit in @entity16 earlier this month that played to @entity9 ' strengths , @entity0 and @entity13 were found wanting			1
@entity19 's @entity18 ( right ) still has designs on this year 's @entity22 title an abysmal start did not help , and despite several stunning overtaking moves , @entity0 finished fifth behind a @entity9 one - two spearheaded by @entity8			1
ahead of sunday 's grand prix under the lights in @entity27 , @entity0 trails @entity10 by 72 points and @entity8 by 50 , but whilst there remains an opportunity , he will not be throwing in the towel			1
' ideally if we could head to @entity34 ( the final race where double points are on offer ) within 50 points and have a chance then i think that will be a huge achievement no matter what happens , ' said @entity0			2
' to even just get to the last race and still be in with a shot would be awesome , which is the aim , but the approach is still race - by - race			2
' i 'm aware the title is distant , but we 've some tracks now that suit us , and i 've won some races this year so i know if i get in that position i 've got a good chance of doing it again			0
' all it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader and all of a sudden everything 's possible again , so let 's see what happens			0
' @entity0 has conceded patience will need to be his main ally this weekend at arguably the most demanding venue of the season			2
back - to - back victories either side of the summer break have propelled @entity0 into contention ' when you walk around on thursday the surface always looks pretty dirty , ' said the @entity74 of the @entity75			1
' modern street races like this tend to wash and scrub the track , but even that does n't really change the fact that what you 're driving on is a public road with all the grit , grime and dirt that those have			0
' it means you 're in for a slithery , bumpy weekend - which i love ! ' the important thing in @entity27 is to not get caught chasing the set - up on a friday			0
' the track is going to evolve , so you 've just got to be patient and let it happen without constantly tweaking your car , trying to hit a moving target			0
' it 's one of those races where you 're never completely satisfied with the amount of preparation you do			0
