climate change is expected to contribute to a ' dramatic increase ' in forest fires in @entity3 , according to a new study			1
the research claims that increased temperatures and longer droughts will create a 200 per cent increase in raging forest infernos by 2090			1
however , preventive fires could keep that increase to below 50 per cent , the @entity11 scientists claim			1
research claims that increased temperatures and droughts will create a 200 per cent increase in forest fires researchers at the @entity19 focused on two strategies to mitigate the impact : prescribed burns and fire suppression			1
prescribed burns help prevent major fires by removing dead wood from forests			1
' there is still a big debate on the effectiveness of prescribed burning as a forest fire management tool , ' said @entity33 , who led the study			2
' this study shows that it can be a promising option to protect @entity3 forests from the impacts of climate change			2
' prescribed burns help prevent major fires by removing dead wood from forests			1
' there is still a big debate on the effectiveness of prescribed burning as a forest fire management tool , ' said researcher @entity33 the study also examined the potential of better firefighting to help reduce burned areas			2
but in a statement , the research team said no study has yet managed to find out the cost and benefit of such efforts at a continental scale			0
' @entity3 forests are vital reservoirs for wildlife , for biodiversity , and for our own enjoyment and well - being , ' said dr @entity33 , ' we need to find ways to protect them			2
' the researchers claim that in @entity3 , over 95 per cent of all forest fires are caused by humans , including negligence when smoking cigarettes , using campfires and other open fires that are not put out properly , and even arson			1
' in more populous areas , the chance of occurrence of forest fires rises dramatically , ' said researcher @entity74 , a study co-author			1
this map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents			0
the @entity79 report claims that no one will be untouched by climate change ' we could prevent many of these fires simply by being more responsible			1
' the findings follow a recent report that claims no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges , flooding and heatwaves among the key risks of global warming in the coming decades			1
this was the warning made in the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) @entity95 report , published in march			2
the report said that violent conflicts , food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years			2
it argued that rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species			0
it also claimed that the world is in ‘ an era of man - made climate change ’ and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans			1
@entity3 : the @entity79 expects ' multiple stresses and systemic failures due to climate change ' in the @entity116			1
this will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050			0
@entity120 : flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of @entity126			2
southern areas are expected to experience a shortage of water			0
@entity130 : the majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern @entity130			0
however , water is also expected to affect most of @entity130			0
@entity135 : there remains uncertainty about impact in @entity135 , but extreme weather is predicted			0
the @entity140 will continue to degrade , with warmer water bleaching more coral			0
@entity143 : food security will be a major issue for @entity143			0
crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought			0
there will also be more soil erosion from storms			0
@entity153 and @entity154 : scientists expect @entity156 may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100 , while the area around @entity159 could get a 25 per cent increase .			0

preventive fires may keep increase to under 50 per cent , study says
these fires help prevent major *destruction* by removing dead wood
in @entity3 , more than 95 per cent of forest fires are caused by humans
study follows a recent @entity79 report that claims that storms , flooding and heatwaves are among key risks of global warming in the coming decades
