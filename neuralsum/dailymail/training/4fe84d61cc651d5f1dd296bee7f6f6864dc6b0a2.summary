an award - winning reporter has revealed how he fantasized about killing a former neighbour who had brutally raped him when he was seven			1
@entity4 , 41 , meticulously planned the murder and how he would get away with it - until his mother came across his childhood diary and revealed she finally knew about the abuse			1
@entity4 said at that point he was forced to give up on the killing as his motive for murder was revealed - so he enacted a different type of revenge : publishing a story about the violent attack			1
he first shared the story about his desire for revenge in a 2004 article for the @entity23 , and it was featured on @entity24			2
the story is now being turned into a play in @entity27			0
' i arrived at a point in my mind where it seemed to me that murder was entirely rational , justifiable and even a morally responsible course of action , ' he said			0
innocent : he was just seven ( pictured ) when he was raped by the family friend , who was 17 he recalled how he was abused when his family lived in @entity45 , @entity46 and were having dinner with their best friends , who had a son - a high school football player - ten years older than @entity4			1
one night in 1978 , the parents were chatting and drinking wine , when the 17 - year - old took @entity4 to his room in the basement , saying he would teach him some karate moves			1
but the older boy soon backed him into a corner , where @entity4 fell to his knees			1
at that point , the teenager forced him to give him oral sex before pushing the young boy to his bed			0
@entity4 sobbed through the pain , not knowing what had happened			2
the older boy told him never to tell anyone about the attack			0
' part of it was i did n't really have a firm concept of what had happened , ' he told @entity31			0
' nobody ever talked to me about sex or rape ... i did n't have the words to apply to it ... it was easier to keep quiet			0
' in the following years , the older boy taunted him , grabbing his crotch when @entity4 was around as if he would attack him again			2
as he researched rape as a teenager , he learned about the cycle of abuse and feared he would become a pedophile			1
he decided to kill himself if he ever felt those feelings emerge			0
attacker : he said he looked up to the football star , who he has never named , but was left in fear of him ' i felt like a werewolf had bitten me and it was only a matter of time before the full moon rose , ' he wrote in his article			2
following college , @entity4 became a reporter and the job sent him across the country before he eventually reached @entity102 , @entity103			2
his mother revealed that the man - who she did not know had raped her son - was living there too with his wife and children			1
@entity4 feared he could be victimising them and knew he had to stop it			1
he began stalking the man and learning his habits and routes			0
he bought an untraceable gun and planned to shoot him in the crotch and then the head during one of the man 's late - night walks			2
confused : @entity4 , with his mother , said he did not understand what had happened and told no one suffering in silence : it meant he believed he could get away with killing the man without becoming a suspect			1
@entity4 , pictured as a child , decided to murder the man when he learned he had moved nearby @entity4 reasoned that because never told anyone about the abuse ' there was nothing in recent history to connect me to him , ' and he would not be caught			1
but just ten days after buying the gun , he received a call from his mother			0
she had found his childhood diary and read about his horrific rape , which he had written about when he was 11			1
' i know now that what he did to me is rape , ' the entry wrote			2
' i wonder what will happen when i grow up and see him when i am grown up			0
will i smile and shake his hand and pretend nothing happened ? or will i punch him in the face ? his mother immediately wrote to the family telling them that their son was a monster , and @entity4 said he was forced to call off the murder because he now had a motive			1
sadness : but his mother called him after she found a childhood diary where he had written about the rape but the following year , he wrote to his attacker and said they should meet			1
' i do n't want your blood or your money , ' he wrote			0
' just one uncomfortable conversation			0
' the rapist agreed to meet him and @entity4 went armed with a gun and a tape recorder			2
the man told @entity4 that he had been his only victim			1
' i 've thought 100 times about contacting you in the last 20 years to tell you that , and i just never had the courage to pick up the phone , ' he said as they met			0
' i 'm sorry for the pain i 've caused you and my parents and your parents			0
' @entity4 , who had been writing a story about his ordeal , decided that there was a chance the man was telling the truth , so he decided not to print his name			1
when the story was printed and aired on @entity24 , rape victims from across the country contacted him to thank him			2
it was also heard by the artistic director of @entity190 , @entity191			0
exposed : he wrote the story for his paper and it is now becoming an off @entity197 play in @entity27 ' i just happened to be listening to a @entity24 podcast and i stopped in my tracks , kind of paralyzed , ' he told @entity31			1
' immediately , i thought this story needs to be told			0
' @entity4 , who is now married with a son , said he would encourage any other rape victims to enact their revenge			1
' not only do you have the right , ' he said , but arguably , you have the obligation to exact some form of revenge on the person who sexually assaulted you when you were a kid			0
' you have that same special , critical knowledge that i had			0
you know , beyond any doubt , the identity of a kiddie rapist			0

@entity4 was raped by the teenage son of a family friend in 1978
he never told anyone but in 2003 he learned the man lived close by
feared the man could be hurting more victims so planned his murder
only called it off when his mother found his childhood journal about the rape , and he knew that his motive had been revealed
he wrote an article about it which is now being made into a play
