@entity0 is @entity1 's leafiest county according to the first ever complete tree count in @entity3 and @entity4			1
experts have carried out the exhaustive tree survey using the latest aerial mapping technology , showing there are 280 million trees in the @entity1			1
it revealed that the highest concentration of trees was not in rural areas but surprisingly in @entity14 and @entity0			1
the first ever complete tree count in @entity3 and @entity4 has been carried out showing there are 280 million - with the most densely covered areas in @entity0			1
the new tree map shows dark green over @entity14 and surrounding areas , representing a densely tree populated area the resulting map shows seven of the county 's districts were in the top ten , with large swathes of dark green - representing a densely tree populated area - in @entity14 and the surrounding commuter belt			1
the new tree map shows large light patches where you 'd expect to see trees in the countryside - and large dark green over @entity14 and surrounding areas			1
people behind the research says @entity0 features so heavily because of the large gardens - where in more rural areas trees tend to be cut down for agricultural reasons			1
rather than rural areas , its the residential estates and urban streets that are more heavily covered by trees , researchers found using photographs taken from planes			2
the @entity49 district of @entity0 is 40 per cent covered , making it the most densely populated area			2
the resulting map shows seven of the county 's districts were in the top ten , with large swathes of dark green - representing a densely tree populated area - surprisingly in @entity14 and the surrounding commuter belt @entity58 , in @entity59 , and @entity60 , in @entity57 , are the only forests to feature in the top ten , according to the @entity63 by @entity64			1
the company 's technical director , @entity65 , said : ' if you think about driving around @entity0 , it 's the big gardens and big houses with all the trees			1
' it 's strange - you 'd think the big forests would be in the top ten			1
but the forests tend to be in more rural areas which are heavily farmed			0
' they have taken out huge rows of trees and grown crops - that does n't go on in @entity0			1
' we were also quite surprised at @entity14 and how green it is - most people think cities are devoid of trees			1
' people behind the research says @entity0 features so heavily because of the large gardens - where in more rural areas trees tend to be cut down for agricultural reasons			1
pictured is @entity92 , @entity0 aerial view of @entity94 , @entity57 one of the areas in the @entity1 most densely covered in trees two heavily farmed @entity99 districts , @entity100 and @entity101 , rank bottom with 2 per cent tree coverage and neighbouring @entity105 districts @entity106 and @entity105 are also in the bottom 10			1
@entity108 , in @entity0 , is shortly behind @entity49 and @entity109 , near @entity110 , topped the @entity4 chart with 32 per cent tree coverage			2
@entity64 's managing director @entity113 added : ' it 's really interesting to be able to blow some preconceived ideas out of the window and dispel many popular misconceptions that surround the way we view the places where we work , live and play			2
' researchers also found that @entity3 and @entity4 are covered by nearly 8,000 square miles of trees , an area large enough to cover @entity124			2
the @entity126 - based company also calculated the height of each tree using 3d imaging and will soon release date for @entity131			0
@entity132 hopes the data will be of use to a range of organisations including insurance companies and councils			0
