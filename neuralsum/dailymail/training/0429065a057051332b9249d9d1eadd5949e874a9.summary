plans to make teenage boys and girls share school toilets have been condemned by children ’s campaigner @entity4			1
the @entity7 founder said the proposal for unisex toilets at a school in @entity11 was ‘ one of the worst ideas i ’ve ever heard ’			1
the move will mean that girls as young as 11 will share the bathroom facilities with 16 - year - old boys			1
anger : the plans were condemned by parents and the @entity7 founder @entity4 , pictured parents at @entity24 in @entity25 , which has 1,400 pupils , believe the plans will remove pupils ’ privacy and provide an environment for bullying			1
and they fear the plans could lead to children having sex in the toilets			1
but the school governors have given their backing to the scheme and claim it will cut down on vandalism			0
ms @entity4 said : ' these children are at an age when they are extremely self - conscious and aware of their bodies and the changes they experience ' ‘ these children are at an age when they are extremely self - conscious and aware of their bodies and the changes they experience , ’ said ms @entity4			1
‘ it ’s an extremely delicate time for them and one would hope that a school would seek to make them as comfortable as possible			0
this is one of the worst ideas i ’ve ever heard and i suggest the school rethinks its proposal			1
’ parent @entity51 , 39 , said : ‘ many parents are upset that the school has dreamt up these proposals without consulting them			2
some girls will be as young as 11 and experiencing puberty – not something to be shared with teenage boys as old as 16			0
‘ i think it is a bit much to ask teenagers to be responsible enough to give each other privacy			0
girls in particular need privacy and there will be boys calling at them over the cubicle doors			0
‘ teenagers are full of hormones and i ’m sure this will encourage them to canoodle in the loos – whether it ’s heavy petting or worse			0
’ designs for two shared toilet areas have been posted on a school noticeboard , one with 11 cubicles for females , ten for males and one for disabled pupils , the other with eight male toilets and ten female			1
both have wash basins in the middle of the room			0
a sign underneath the designs reads : ‘ these are just to give an idea of the proposed layout for the new unisex toilets			2
the colours of the cubicles and hand wash area we propose to have will be much brighter and the whole area more modern looking			0
’ school governor @entity97 said the governing body has approved the idea and is waiting for it to go to a funding committee			0
he added : ‘ the toilets have been in desperate need of refurbishment for a long time and we decided the best way of reducing vandalism was to make them unisex			2
i understand parents ’ concerns but we have had someone researching child welfare and this has not raised any red flags			2
