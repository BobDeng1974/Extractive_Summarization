by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 16 march 2012 updated : 11:18 est , 16 march 2012 deadly : the number of @entity3 cases in @entity4 is on the rise , because more prostitutes are on the streets and needle exchange programmes have been scrapped @entity11 cuts to the @entity4 health service have seen the country 's @entity3 and @entity14 rates soar - sparking fears it is becoming a third world nation			1
aid agencies said the cutting of hospital budgets by an astonishing 40 per cent had also led to a sharp rise in the number of citizens being diagnosed with @entity25			1
in the south , they said , it is reaching near endemic levels not seen since 1970s			1
the scrapping of needle exchange services has seen the number of @entity3 and @entity34 sufferers in central @entity36 rise by 1,250 per cent in 2011 alone			2
there are more prostitutes on the streets selling their bodies to make ends meet , while heroin addicts are finding it harder to come by anti-retroviral treatments			2
there is also the first instances ever of the two illnesses being transmitted between mother and child - something usually equated with @entity50 and not @entity51			2
@entity53 @entity4 's @entity52 said the health service cuts , which saw widespread job losses , were putting social services ' under very severe strain '			1
she added : ' if not in a state of breakdown			0
what we are seeing are very clear indicators of a system that can not cope '			2
she said the 40 per cent cuts were on top of a 24 per cent increase in 2011 in demand for medical services			2
this , she said , was ' largely because people could simply no longer afford private healthcare			0
the entire system is deteriorating '			1
on the rise : the number of @entity3 and @entity34 sufferers in @entity4 is soaring she added : ' there has also been a sharp increase in cases of tuberculosis in the immigrant population			1
' cases of @entity84 fever - leading to 35 deaths in 2010 - and the reappearance of endemic malaria in several parts of @entity4			1
' the simple fact of the reappearance of malaria , with 100 - odd cases in southern @entity4 last year and 20 to 30 more elsewhere , shows barriers to healthcare access have risen			1
' malaria is treatable , it should n't spread if the system is working			1
' good news : @entity4 is set to receive the next tranche of eurozone bailout cash next week the news comes as it was revealed @entity4 will get € 5.9billion in new bailout money on monday			1
it is the first slice of a new rescue package meant to keep the country afloat while it overhauls its economy			0
@entity4 stands to receive a total of € 172.7 billion from its partners in the 17 - nation eurozone and the @entity108 until 2016			1
@entity110 now owes more money than it has done in the last 20 years , the @entity109 said			1
for 2011 the country 's public debt was 68.5 percent of gross domestic product , up from 61.2 per cent in 2010			1
while it is a relatively low ratio , compared with its 16 eurozone peers who have an average 87.7 per cent , it has almost doubled from 36.3 per cent in 2007			0
this is because there is a lack of economic impetus since the credit - and - construction bubble burst in 2008			2
@entity110 has been ordered by the @entity122 to cut its budget shortfall from 8.5 per cent of @entity124 in 2011 to 5.3 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 2013			1
it has forced prime minister @entity126 to hunt for savings worth around € 60billion			2
this year 's target is a compromise after @entity126 defied @entity130 by ditching a much tighter goal of 4.4 per cent of gdp agreed by the previous government			0
but the task will be made tougher as the economy is thought to already be in its second recession in three years , with the government expecting output to shrink 1.7 per cent in 2012			0
the cuts has led to the closure of 27 publicly run companies , some of which were duplicates - such as a water company			2
others included a loss - making entity tasked with stimulating @entity110 's small housing rental market and one created to back the @entity147 in 1992			1
the central bank also said @entity110 's 17 autonomous regions , blamed for the lion 's share of the fiscal slippage last year , ran debt up by 17.3 per cent in 2011 to € 140billion			1
the data showed the country 's wealthiest region of @entity156 , was the most indebted , closely followed by @entity157			0
both had debt - to - gdp ratios of around 20 per cent compared to an average of 13.1 per cent			1
tighter controls over regional budgets imposed by the central government aim to bring their spending back under control this year , even if analysts retain doubts over their future compliance and banks ' balance sheets			0
the sum includes money left over from the country 's first rescue package and a new € 130billion programme			1
the disbursement was approved earlier this week , said @entity177 , the @entity122 representative to the troika - the debt inspectors from the @entity180 , the @entity181 and the @entity108 who are managing the @entity4 bailout			1
the bailout , on its own , will not be enough to ease the country 's financial woes			0
an @entity180 report released today said @entity4 must make a sustained effort to attract future investment and support export - led growth as it seeks to recover from a recession that is now in its fifth year			1
but the report , prepared by the @entity122 and the @entity181 , also said a bond swap deal with private creditors has made the country 's debt load far more sustainable in the long - term			2
the news has had a positive effect on @entity51 financial markets			0
the @entity201 is today 0.45 per cent up at 5,967.43 ; @entity203 's @entity202 is 0.54 per cent up at 3,599.37 ; and @entity205 's @entity204 is 0.33 per cent up at 7,168.37			0
the report projects that , assuming interim targets are met , @entity4 's debt - to - gdp ratio will decline to below 117 per cent in 2020 and to below 90 per cent in 2030			1
it was as high as 160 per cent of gdp before the debt relief deal was agreed with private creditors			0
while progress has been made in reforming the economy , significant concerns remain , including inflation , a lack of credit available to households and business , and the need to regain competitiveness by reducing labor costs , @entity177 said			0
' one of the priorities of this second program is the recapitalization of banks , ' @entity177 said			0
for one thing , bank deposits have fallen , he said			0
for another , the agreement to write down private debt ' will leave holes in the balance sheets of banks , because they held government bonds , ' he added			0
he said the new program includes € 50 billion for bank recapitalisation			0
' this is an enormous amount , ' he said			0
@entity177 also warned that significant more belt - tightening lies ahead			0
' the target for this year is a primary deficit of 1 per cent , ' he said , referring to the budget balance before interest payments			0
' and the programme target for 2014 is a surplus of 4.5 per cent			0
and therefore people have to be aware that , in terms of fiscal adjustment , there 's still a long way to go			0
' he said the @entity4 government will have to identify before this summer how it plans to close that gap .			2
