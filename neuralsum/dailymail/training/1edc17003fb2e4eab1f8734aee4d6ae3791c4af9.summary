no one would much like the idea of eating 6lb of tomatoes a day			0
but if their goodness was popped in an easy - to - swallow pill that you were told might prevent strokes and heart attacks you would probably be putting in an order tomorrow			2
researchers believe they may have come up with just that after trials on the supplement @entity12			2
health secret : the @entity12 pill contains the lycopene chemical found in tomato skin the daily pill contains a chemical called lycopene which makes tomatoes red and is known to break down fatty deposits in the arteries			1
a @entity25 study found taking the capsule boosted blood flow and improved the lining of vessels in patients with pre-existing heart conditions			1
it also increased the flexibility of their arteries by 50 per cent			0
the scientists believe it could limit the damage caused by heart disease – responsible for 180,000 deaths a year – and help cut the 49,000 deaths a year from strokes			0
breakthrough : scientists believe the new pill will save millions of lives around the world			1
dr @entity48 , right , is the director of @entity25 's clinical trials unit natural remedy : the pill incorporates a newly developed version of modified lycopene compound they also hope it could benefit those with arthritis , diabetes and even slow the progress of cancer			1
each pill provides the equivalent of eating around 6lb of ripe tomatoes			0
studies have shown eating a @entity66 - style diet rich in tomatoes , fish , vegetables , nuts and olive oil can significantly reduce cholesterol and help prevent cardiovascular disease			1
preliminary results from a two - month trial , in which the pill was given to 36 heart disease patients and 36 healthy volunteers with an average age of 67 , were presented at a meeting of the @entity81			2
it was shown to improve the function of the endothelium – the layer of cells lining blood vessels			0
it also boosted their sensitivity to nitric oxide , the gas which triggers the dilation of the arteries in response to exercise			0
@entity48 , of @entity25 ’s clinical trials unit , said : ‘ these results are potentially very significant , but we need more trials to see if they translate into fewer heart attacks and strokes			0
’ @entity104 , a leading neurosurgeon and medical adviser to @entity106 , which has developed @entity12 , said : ‘ it is too early to come to firm conclusions , but the results from this trial are far better than anything we could have hoped for			0
’ further studies are planned , with researchers hoping it could offer an alternative to statins for heart disease sufferers who can not take the cholesterol - lowering drugs			2
@entity121 , of the @entity122 , said : ‘ although this showed lycopene improved blood flow in people with heart disease , that ’s a long way from demonstrating that taking it could improve outcomes for people with heart disease			1
the best way to get the benefits of a @entity66 diet is to eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables			1
’ trial : @entity12 was shown to dramatically improve the function of the cells lining blood vessels under the microscope : dr @entity143 said more trials are needed to explore the health benefits further			1
