he may be pushing 94 , but prince @entity1 ’s not lost one iota of his sense of humour			2
watching his wife sign an empty picture mount – in which a glossy portrait of the monarch was later placed - the on - form royal remarked waspishly : ‘ it ’s not a very good likeness , is it ? ’ @entity1 had accompanied the @entity12 to @entity13 to officially name the new £ 473 million @entity16 cruise liner @entity14 , in which the finished photograph will , eventually , hang			1
on being introduced to @entity16 ’s @entity30 director , @entity29 , yesterday , he remarked : ‘ humans are not resources ! ’ fortunately the executive took the off - the - cuff comment in her stride , laughing afterwards : ‘ i thought it was a very good line			2
i shall be using it again			0
’ @entity12 , 88 , also appeared to be thoroughly enjoying herself , even tapping her feet in time to the music of the @entity40 as they played a merry jig before @entity14 ’s official naming ceremony			1
wit : watching his wife sign an empty picture mount – in which a glossy portrait of the monarch was later placed - the on - form royal remarked waspishly : ‘ it ’s not a very good likeness , is it ? ’ tears of laughter : the @entity12 chuckled during the ceremony and wiped away a tear of laughter nowadays the monarch does n’t actually have to swing the bottle of bubbly – in this case a @entity59 ( 20 bottles ) of @entity62 sparkling wine from the @entity63 near @entity64 , @entity65 – used to christen the boat herself			1
instead she discreetly presses a button and the work is done for her			0
the new mechanised system is n’t entirely foolproof , however			0
when the bottle struck the side of the ship it exploded with an almighty bang , sending one hefty shard of glass speeding to within a few feet of where the @entity12 was sitting			1
fortunately the forward - thinking people from @entity16 had erected a plastic screen to protect the elderly sovereign			0
all the same , it was quite a moment and clearly struck a chord with the guest of honour			0
when the @entity12 met a line - up of chefs later , including @entity88 , she referred to the incident exclaiming : ‘ it exploded ! ’ @entity91 , @entity14 ’s wine expert , replied : ‘ it did , did n’t it , @entity93 ' round of applause : the @entity12 cheers during the naming ceremony for @entity14 having a chat : the @entity12 enjoys a chat during the naming ceremony for @entity14 round of applause : the queen claps as the sixth cruise ship she has sponsored is officially named enjoying the sunshine : a dapper @entity1 appeared to be enjoying his day in @entity13 is that you dear ? the @entity1 flips through the programme and stops at a picture of the queen thankfully , however , some traditions have n’t gone by the wayside			1
‘ @entity113 bless her and all who sail in her , ’ the sovereign also said			0
surprisingly , @entity116 confirmed yesterday , the @entity12 has only named four civilian ships previously ( the @entity118 in 1967 , @entity119 in 1995 , queen mary 2 in 2004 and @entity121 in 2010 , with the @entity14 as the fifth )			1
but the monarch appeared to be thoroughly enjoying herself , chatting nineteen to the dozen with other vip guests as she toured the vessel			0
she was heard telling tv chef @entity126 , one of a number of celebrity chefs who will be offering classes for passengers : ‘ the first time i ever saw white bread was on board the old @entity121			0
’ the ship , which cost its owners £ 473m to build , is the third @entity16 ship to be named @entity14 but is easily the largest of the trio , with 15 passenger decks , 13 restaurants and four pools on - board			1
@entity14 was also the name of the @entity12 's much - loved @entity145 which was decommissioned in 1997 under the orders of then prime minister @entity147			1
berthed in @entity150 's @entity149 , the ship is now a static tourist attraction but sailed more than 1,000,000 miles during its 40 years in royal service			0
the new @entity14 is expected to rack up a similar number of miles during its own career , although unlike the @entity12 's yacht , it will host tourists rather than dignitaries			2
today , however , dignitaries were the order of the day for the new @entity14 , with the @entity12 and the @entity1 shown around the new ship by a large group of them			1
is n't it magnificent ? the @entity1 and the @entity12 appear to be sharing their observations of the ship ready to launch : the @entity12 presses the button that will launch a bottle of fizz against the ship smashing ! the @entity12 smashes a bottle of £ 24.95 @entity62 sparkling wine against the ship job done ! the bottle of @entity62 sparkling wine smashes into hundreds of pieces celebration : red white and blue confetti rains down on the @entity12 after the bottle is smashed sponsor : the queen is all smiles as she becomes godmother to @entity16 ' ship @entity14 magnificent : @entity14 is the newest @entity16 ship and can carry up to 3,600 people gargantuan : the vessel also boasts 15 passenger decks , 13 restaurants and four swimming pools the queen is no stranger to cruise ships in any case , having become godmother to no fewer than five - now six , including @entity14			1
first of the liners launched by the @entity12 was @entity196 's @entity118 , which was christened in 1967 and made her maiden voyage in 1969			1
now permanently moored in @entity199 after retiring in 2008 , its owners plan to turn it into a floating luxury hotel , although plans for the conversion are currently stalled			0
other vessels launched by the @entity12 include the @entity119 in 1995 , the queen mary 2 in 2004 and @entity121 , another @entity196 ship , in 2010			2
well - wishers : the queen was joined by @entity209 , @entity210 and hairdresser @entity211 supporter : chef @entity88 at the event			0

in 2007 , the @entity252 launched @entity196 's @entity253 at @entity13 , returning five years later to blow out the candles on its fifth birthday in 2013			0
the same year saw the @entity256 become a ship 's godmother for the first time , with the royal , who was making her last public appearance before the birth of @entity263 , invited to christen @entity265 ' @entity264			2

other vessels with royal connections include the @entity276 's new aircraft carrier , @entity277 , which was launched by her majesty in @entity279 with a bottle of whisky last year			1
the @entity252 also has a naval vessel to her name , in her case the high - tech nuclear - powered submarine , @entity286			0
