by @entity0 @entity2 governor @entity1 will not have a warrant issued for his arrest but could be forced to pose for a mugshot			1
the @entity7 's fate was decided on monday when a judge issued a summons after a grand jury indicted him for felony charges			2
but the governor still faces the unflattering prospect of being booked , fingerprinted and having his mugshot taken at some point			0
however , leading conservatives around the country have come out in support of the longest - serving governor in @entity2 history			2
' this is nothing more than banana republic politics , ' @entity36 a @entity37 - based defense attorney who will head a cadre of four lawyers from @entity2 and @entity40 defending @entity1 , said			1
' the charges lobbed against the governor are a really nasty attack not only on the rule of law but on the @entity46 , the state of @entity2 and also the fundamental constitutional protections that we all enjoy			2
' @entity7 @entity52 gov. @entity51 , a potential rival for the 2016 race released a statement monday saying he has ' complete faith and confidence in governor @entity1 's honesty and integrity			1
' this was echoed by @entity62 gov. @entity61 , @entity64 gov. @entity63 and @entity66 sen. @entity65 of @entity2 who may all may seek the @entity7 @entity23 nomination			1
support : @entity7 @entity52 gov. @entity51 , left , released a statement saying he has complete faith and confidence in gov. @entity1 's honesty and integrity and @entity61 appeared to agree with his sentiments @entity74 gov. @entity73 said the charges ' could well help ' @entity1			1
gov. @entity73 , a @entity7 said : ' it is an attack			2
it also is coming out of a county where you would n't expect even - handedness			0
' on monday , @entity82 judge @entity82 decided against issuing an arrest warrant and instead a special prosecutor appointed to the matter was planning a simple legal summons			0
but that still means a booking is in gov. @entity1 's future although it 's not known exactly when this will take place			1
mr @entity36 said : ' that 's going to be something , that when he goes in to be booked and take his picture that we 're going to let you know about			0
' gov. @entity1 's arraignment — a court appearance to answer the charges — could be held on aug. 29 at 9 a.m. a spokesman for gov. @entity1 said that date had not been confirmed , adding that the governor would n't need to appear personally at the arraignment			1
he will , however , have to appear at his booking			0
a grand jury in @entity106 , a liberal bastion in otherwise largely conservative @entity2 , indicted gov. @entity1 for carrying out a threat to veto $ 7.5 million in funding for the state 's public integrity unit			1
@entity113 district attorney @entity112 , a @entity114 , refused to resign following a drunken driving arrest			0
the ethics unit is housed under ms @entity112 's office			0
fightback : gov. @entity1 makes a statement in @entity106 , @entity2 on august 16 , 2014 over the charges he faces no one disputes that @entity1 has the power to veto measures approved by the @entity125 , but his threat to do so before actually carrying it out prompted a complaint from a left - leaning watchdog			1
the grand jury met for months before handing down its indictment , and gov. @entity1 's $ 450 per - hour defense attorney was paid using state funds			2
mr @entity36 said the public will continue footing the bill for the governor 's now pricier legal team , though he said a private foundation could eventually be established to handle some of the costs			0
after gov. @entity1 avoided an arrest warrant questions were raised of favoritism , but legal observers said forgoing an arrest warrant is common in white - collar cases			2
on friday , gov. @entity1 became the first @entity2 governor since 1917 to be indicted and is facing charges of coercion and official oppression that carry a maximum sentence of 109 years in prison			1
he is also facing allegations of carrying out a threat to veto funding for the state 's public integrity unit last summer			0
but the governor has emphatically stood by his veto and denied all wrongdoing			0
but gov. @entity1 's aides said the case wo n't derail his busy travel schedule			1
he is still on schedule to visit several key presidential battleground states as he continues to eye a second run for the @entity23 in 2016			1
he will visit @entity74 , @entity166 and @entity167 in the next two weeks			0
he is also due to give a speech on thursday on immigration at the @entity170 in @entity40			0
the speech is an attempt to re-brand himself to a national audience after stumbling badly during his short - lived 2012 presidential campaign			0
former @entity66 attorney @entity175 said that insisting on an arrest warrant for @entity1 would have been ' grandstanding			0
' ' he 's obviously not a flight risk or danger to the community , ' mr @entity175 said			0
@entity181 : a judge decided not to issue an arrest warrant for gov. @entity1 conservatives have also have been quick to note that a video recording made at the jail showed ms @entity112 shouting at staffers , kicking the door of her cell and sticking her tongue out at deputies			2
gov. @entity1 's attorneys showed the ' outrageous ' video again while addressing reporters monday			2
yet , gov. @entity1 has not been backed by everyone			1
@entity198 gov. @entity198 's re-election campaign removed a video endorsement by the @entity2 governor from its website following gov. @entity1 's indictment .			1

he is facing charges of coercion and official oppression
the charges carry a maximum sentence of 109 years in prison
@entity7 have shown *widespread* support for governor @entity1
@entity61 , gov. @entity63 and @entity65 of @entity2 have all backed him
