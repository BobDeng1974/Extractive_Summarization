@entity1 motorsport boss @entity0 said he would re-break his arm if it offered a guarantee neither of his team 's cars would endure any more reliability issues this season			1
following @entity10 's early retirement in sunday 's @entity11 , there is deep concern inside @entity1 the destiny of the title will be determined more by luck than by skill out on the track			2
mercedes have scored seven one - two finishes this year and are poised to wrap up the constructors ' crown in one of the next two races in @entity24 or @entity25			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 says he would do anything to avoid more mechanical issues this season but there have now been four mechanical retirements - two apiece for @entity30 and @entity10 - plus issues for the former in both @entity33 and @entity34 in qualifying that cost him points			1
with @entity30 now in possession of the championship lead for only the second time this season , and first time in four months , just three points separate him from @entity10			1
it is almost a level - playing field , effectively making the rest of the season a five - race title fight , but with both drivers knowing another reliability hit could prove fatal to their title hopes			2
@entity0 , who broke his right arm and collarbone in a cycling accident two months ago , said : ' we have a great team dedicated to quality , and i 'm really proud of that department			2
both @entity10 and @entity30 have failed to finish twice each because of mechanical faults ' despite that , it 's even more astonishing we continue to have these issues			1
' i guess it takes time for the whole group to come together and time until we stop suffering from these @entity65 ( did not finish ) which are unacceptable for us as we have had four of them now			0
' if we could do anything more to stop the @entity65 then we would do it			0
i would break my arm again ! ' we just have to get on top of the problems			0
' asked as to whether he was worried unreliability would prove to be the decisive factor , @entity0 replied : ' that is something that would not be satisfying at all			2
@entity30 won in @entity75 to take him top of the drivers ' standings for only the second time this season ' we do n't want any spin in there that the championship was decided because one car let down the driver			1
' we need to re-focus , get our heads down and keep concentrating on what we can do , what the utmost is , to prevent reliability problems for @entity10 and @entity30			1
' after @entity10 's car suffered a wiring loom failure inside the steering column prior to the race from which the @entity33 retired after 14 laps , @entity0 conceded to worry @entity30 would not win			1
' when you have one car remaining , and it 's the only weapon out there , then you have doubts about everything , ' said @entity0			0
@entity10 had problems both on the grid and in the pit lane in @entity75 and eventually retired on lap 15 ' it was clear when @entity30 ' last pit stop was okay and he came out two seconds behind @entity104 ( @entity105 ) that he would probably get ahead , but up until that point there was always a doubt			1
' prior to that stop @entity30 had to produce an astonishing performance to open up a gap of 27 seconds to his pursuers , none of whom had to pit again , to ensure he remained in the hunt for the win once he emerged back on track			0
' that was really awesome , ' added @entity0			0
' these are the @entity30 days , when you recognise how great he is , and it makes the difference between the superstars and the stars , the very best and best ones			0
