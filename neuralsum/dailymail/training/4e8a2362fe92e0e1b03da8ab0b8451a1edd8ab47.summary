videoed : former minister @entity0 was filmed appearing to boast that he had previously coached a paying client in private a @entity4 mp has complained about a government global - warming adviser ’s undisclosed green interests – despite the fact he himself is paid a fortune by eco-energy and transport firms			1
@entity0 , chairman of the @entity13 select committee , has protested about @entity15 remaining chairman of @entity16 while also chairing the @entity17 , an independent body that advises the government on the impact of climate change			1
mr @entity0 ’s critics will argue his protest smacks of hypocrisy as he has been paid more than £ 400,000 by three green companies since 2009			1
@entity15 , @entity15 – who as agriculture minister in 1990 tried to persuade his daughter @entity27 to eat a hamburger during the @entity30 crisis – was required to undergo a ‘ confirmation hearing ’ before @entity0 ’s committee last september after being appointed chair of the @entity32			1
at the time @entity15 had stepped down from his job as chairman of @entity37 , a consortium set up to build a hugely subsidised windfarm , but he remained chairman of @entity16			1
asked at the hearing whether this could be a conflict of interest , @entity15 said he had resigned from all his energy business interests , adding : ‘ if you look at what it [ @entity45 ] does , it really has no connection at all			1
and if i thought it even had a remote connection , i would make that change [ resign ]			2
’ but , as this newspaper revealed in january , @entity45 has a thriving eco business connecting windfarms to the @entity54			1
mr @entity0 has set out his protest in a letter to energy secretary mr @entity56			1
he wrote : ‘ the committee was given to understand that @entity45 was not an energy company , and that @entity15 would not retain links with energy companies			1
but , as is clear from @entity45 ’s website and annual report and accounts , the company has a significant role in the field of energy			2
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ the lack of clarity on this specific point has caused ongoing media criticism			1
the reassurances you have given are not sufficient to effectively address the perception of conflict of interest in the public domain			2
’ mr @entity0 has been paid £ 402,033.88 by three green companies since august 2009			1
he is paid many thousands more as a director of the @entity80			1
the ‘ @entity93 ’ contains a cable whose purpose is to keep @entity85 ’s lights on using @entity87 power if our own supply becomes inadequate following the shutdown of coal stations caused by green restrictions			1
lord @entity15 yesterday continued to insist he had ‘ no dealings whatsoever ’ with the @entity45 division that dealt with energy			1
he added : ‘ since being made aware of this activity , i have ensured that i will never be involved , receive any papers , or participate in any way			2
’ fresh storm : as agriculture minister in 1990 @entity15 , @entity15 , tried to persuade his daughter @entity27 to eat a hamburger during the @entity30 crisis @entity105 secretary @entity56 used a speech at the @entity107 last week to mount an extraordinary and intemperate attack on newspapers such as this one , claiming we have published misleading ' destructive scepticism ' and ignoring the science on global warming			1
here our correspondent writes an open letter in reply : it is mr @entity118 says , who is being less than straight with the facts			1
dear @entity56 last week you made a speech which sounded uncomfortably as if you wanted to shut this newspaper up			2
you said that journalists like me , who have raised serious questions about global warming and energy policy , were ‘ selectively misreading the evidence ’ and arguing that ‘ we can relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want ’			2
you claimed that instead of publishing ‘ the serious science ’ , we were propagating ‘ destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism , born of vested interest			2
’ worse still , in your eyes , we have suggested that your policies as @entity137 are ‘ hopelessly misguided ’ because we oppose the vast increases in ‘ renewable ’ energy subsidies which you set out in your @entity140			2
outburst : @entity105 secretary @entity56 used a speech at the @entity107 to mount an extraordinary and intemperate attack on newspapers the @entity145 was the only publication which you mentioned by name			2
so i hope you wo n’t mind when i point out that much of your speech was highly misleading			2
it was a @entity151 - a example of how those in power have become entrenched and wilfully blind to new evidence – of how you seek to crush debate by attacking opponents by mischaracterising what we actually say			2
according to you , we ‘ reject outright that climate change is a result of human activity ’			0
you commented contemptuously : ‘ it ’s the science , stupid ! ’ after all , a recent survey found that 97 per cent of a sample of 12,000 climate science papers accept that human activity – increased carbon dioxide emissions – has contributed to global warming			0
how could we be so dumb as to ignore a consensus like that ? @entity173 , you said , are ‘ with the 97 per cent ’			0
well , mr @entity56 , so am i , as are almost all the climate sceptics and so - called ‘ deniers ’ i have ever spoken to			1
the point is : yes , human activity has warmed the planet , and will probably continue to do so			0
the far more difficult questions are how far and how fast is this likely to happen ? and here the scientific consensus is heading in one direction – towards the view that the world is warming rather more slowly than was thought only a few years ago			0
as this newspaper first reported in october , world temperatures have failed to show any statistically significant increase since 1997			0
according to you , this is a ‘ false summit ’ , after which warming will again become rampant			0
but surely you must also know that this unexpected ‘ pause ’ was not predicted by most climate computer models			0
professor @entity193 of the @entity194 testified at a @entity197 @entity196 hearing that it is likely to last for at least another ten years			0
if it does , climate alarmism – all your talk of a ‘ massive gamble with the planet our children will inherit ’ – is going to look , well , stupid			0
load of hot air : professor @entity207 , head of @entity209 ¿ s @entity208 , has said that billions are being wasted on measures including windfarms in @entity213 your mention of @entity145 came when you quoted an article two weeks ago by professor @entity207 , head of @entity209 ’s @entity208			1
yes , prof @entity207 did say that ‘ almost everyone agrees ’ that emissions have to come down			0
but he went on to add that we are wasting billions on policies – that ’s your policies , mr @entity56 – which will never achieve this end			1
he says : ‘ 90 per cent of the measures adopted since the 1997 @entity226 agreement to cut global emissions are a waste of time and money – including windfarms in @entity213 , carbon taxes and @entity234 carbon trading systems			1
’ in your speech , you implied that if we set ever more ambitious targets covering our own pitiful two per cent of world emissions , one day those much bigger economies will follow suit			0
oh really ? right now , @entity240 and @entity241 have about 800 coal power stations being built or on order			0
we need a proper debate about these issues , one which is n’t fuelled by alarmism and which appreciates that your opponents have valid viewpoints , too			0
but all you have to offer is more of the same : bigger doses of policy prescriptions – taxes , subsidies and the futile quest for a binding global agreement – which have demonstrably failed			0
there is a cost for this			0
@entity85 already has the highest inflation in energy prices in @entity263 ( which actually means the world )			0
yet everything you are doing will increase this further			0
perhaps you think that if you maintain the scaremongering at a shrill enough volume , you ’ll get away with it			0
maybe in the short term you will			0
history , and the ballot box in 2015 , may not be as kind			0
