the price of a booming economy : motorway traffic levels have reached an all - time high as the rise of ‘ @entity8 ’ delivering goods and services continues apace , according to the official @entity13 figures with the @entity23 ’s earnings gross domestic product ( gdp ) also growing the @entity25 said ; ‘ it is likely that such economic growth is contributing to the continued upward trend in traffic volumes			1
’ the @entity30 said the ‘ good news ’ for the economy could spell bad news for millions of motorists caught in gridlock caused by extra traffic and bottlenecks			1
the new figures show that vehicles travelled a record 16.3 billion miles on @entity23 motorways from july to september 2014			0
this was 2.3 per cent higher than over the same period last year 2013 and 1.3 per cent higher than in april to june 2014			2
the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) figures showed that total motor vehicle traffic on @entity23 roads increased 2.2 per cent in summer 2014 compared with summer 2013			2

car traffic was up 1.4 per cent this summer , while traffic increased on all classes of road with the biggest rise ( 3.5 per cent ) being on urban minor roads			0

‘ however it does also put extra strain on parts of the road network adjoining motorways that are not able to cope with the volume of traffic and therefore lead to bottlenecks			0
‘ many of these ‘ pinch points ’ are already being addressed by the @entity89 which is good news for road users who will hopefully benefit from more free - flowing traffic conditions in the future			1
’ mr @entity71 added : ‘ the increase in light good vehicles , or ‘ white van man ’ , is a really encouraging sign that small businesses and tradesmen , the lifeblood of the @entity23 economy , are thriving			1
’ @entity30 director professor @entity105 said : ‘ whoever predicted that the link between economic growth and traffic volume was broken will have to have a rethink			2
gdp is up and mileage is up , just as the @entity25 has always anticipated			0
‘ these figures beg questions about what rising mileage means for congestion , emissions and particularly road safety			0
’ the professor said : ‘ last week we learned there has been a marked rise in road casualties after years of reduction			0
we urgently need a strategy on how we are going to preserve and improve on our generally good safety record against a backdrop of a rising population and increasing traffic			2

traffic conditions only likely to get worse as economy continues to grow
