‘ whether i was or was not in a relationship with @entity11 - it was never a relationship , it was a very brief encounter			0
‘ he was my best friend			0
me saying “ i love you ” – whether anything romantic had happened briefly or not – that was always the way i communicated with him , whether @entity39 was present or not			0

he told the court : ' it was a long , complicated book serialisation			0
i remember the publishers insisted on making changes quite late in the day , and i think the lawyers were involved as well			2
