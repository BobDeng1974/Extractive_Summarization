by @entity1 reporter published : 16:48 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 19:20 est , 30 october 2012 @entity2 may have seemed uniquely damaging to those caught in its path , but some have suggested that global warming could bring even more devastating storms to the @entity9 in coming years			1
@entity11 governor @entity10 and mayor @entity12 both pointed to climate change as the culprit for @entity2 's ravages as they addressed the scale of the destruction on tuesday morning			1
and @entity10 even raised the possibility of a levee being built in @entity21 , an unprecedented move to protect the 400 - year - old city			1
both @entity10 ( left ) and @entity12 agree that climate change is a cause of the superstorm many observers have pointed out that it is almost impossible to pinpoint climate change as the cause of specific weather events			1
moreover , the @entity9 has long been subject to hurricanes and other damaging storms which have been just as violent as @entity2			0
but the terrors wrought by @entity2 , combined with last year 's destructive @entity35 , have led @entity11 's top officials to raise the spectre of global warming			1
at a press conference in @entity40 on tuesday , @entity10 said he had told president @entity41 that ' we have a 100 - year flood every two years now '			2
he added : ' there has been a series of extreme weather incidents			0
that is not a political statement			0
that is a factual statement			0
' anyone who says there 's not a dramatic change in weather patterns , i think is denying reality			2
' @entity12 echoed the sentiment , saying : ' what is clear is that the storms we 've experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are much more severe than before			0
' whether that 's global warming or what , i do n't know , but we 'll have to address those issues			2
' when the governor was asked if officials were contemplating building a levee in the city 's harbour , he replied : ' it is something we 're going to have to start thinking about			2
' the construction of this city did not anticipate these kinds of situations			0
we are only a few feet above sea level			0
' since @entity82 's foundation in the early 17th century , the lower tip of @entity40 has been at the heart of metropolitan life - despite its vulnerability to flooding from the harbour			0
@entity88 predictably joined the climate - change chorus on tuesday , describing the hurricane as ' a disturbing sign of things to come ' in a post on his blog			2
' we must heed this warning and act quickly to solve the climate crisis , ' the former vice president added			0
two possible links between global warming and the damage wrought by @entity2 are the raised sea levels which make it easier for the coast to flood , and warm air in the @entity106 increasing the fierceness of the storm			1
however , many experts have denied that climate change was behind @entity2 - @entity112 science reporter @entity111 wrote that the connection was ' a stretch that is just not supported by science at this time			1
' the @entity116 has previously said that there is little evidence global warming worsens tropical storms and hurricanes .			1

governor @entity10 makes unprecedented suggestion of a possible levee being built for the city
despite a chorus of support for the climate change link , some experts deny there is *sufficient* evidence to blame global warming for the storm
