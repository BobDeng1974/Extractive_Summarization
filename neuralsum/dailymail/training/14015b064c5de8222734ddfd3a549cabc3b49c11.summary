the latest research into pigs may leave some reluctant to tuck into a plate of sausages again			1
scientists have discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy – a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human			1
in an elaborate experiment , experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates			1
scientists at @entity32 in the @entity33 set out to investigate whether pigs can show empathy to one another , defined by renowned primatologist @entity37 as ‘ the capacity to be affected by and share the emotional state of another , assess the reasons for the other ’s state and identify with the other , adopting his or her perspective ’			1
they housed pigs in 16 groups of six , training two of the animals in each of the groups , @entity45 reported			1
scientists at @entity32 in the @entity33 set out to investigate whether pigs can show empathy to one another ( illustrated witha stock image ) just like humans and other animals that comfort each other the pigs were trained either to anticipate happiness or distress , by playing them music and either rewarding them with a pleasant treat such as chocolate raisins and a roomy house filled with peat , or putting them in a stressful situation , such as keeping them in isolation in a small pen			1
@entity74 , ‘ naïve ’ pigs were placed in a pen with a pig conditioned to expect happiness , or one that expected discomfort			1
all the pigs were then played the same music – a piece by @entity82 - used in training			2
asian elephants show concern for others when they are stressed , using their trunks to caress the suffering elephant and emit a soft ' chirp , ' @entity84 recently reported			2
consoling elephants put their trunk into another elephant 's mouth so they are vulnerable , perhaps showing they are there to help			0
crows and ravens are also known to be emotionally intelligent , with researchers at the @entity99 in @entity100 finding that the birds comfort others that are stressed after a fight			2
ravens sit next to the distressed bird so their bodies are touching and sometimes preen it			0
@entity109 research has shown that orangutans ( stock image ) can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others			0
when one orangutan laughs , others often join in scrub jays - another member of the @entity121 family - have ' funerals ' for deceased friends , according to research by the @entity124			0
they fly over the dead body , wailing and screeching , which may be a sign of grief			0
mice have been shown to detect pain among others but only appear to console their family and friends			0
@entity134 , an assistant professor at @entity135 , said : ' mice are capable of a more complex form of empathy than we ever believed possible			0
' similarly , rats are believed to be able to respond to excitement , fear and anger			0
they even help each other out with no prospect of a reward , according to @entity147			2
the rodents also show that they enjoy being tickled and playing by giggling			0
gorillas not only care for each other but have even been seen to care for dolls			0
@entity109 research has shown that orangutans can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others			0
when one orangutan laughs , others often join in			0
some of the trained pigs showed that they anticipated what may happen to them , either by displaying happy behaviours - such as wagging their tails and barking - or signs of stress , such as keeping their ears back , urinating and defecating			1
despite most of the trained pigs failing to react at all , they were still taken to another pen , leaving the naïve pigs behind , and were either rewarded or punished , depending on their training			1
the naïve pigs , which could not have known what lay in store for their penmates , reacted to the trained pigs ’ behaviour anyway			1
for example , when a trained pig showed it was stressed , a naïve pig acted in the same way , by becoming more alert and keeping its ears back			2
the behaviour was even more noticeable when the untrained animals noticed the behaviour of trained ‘ happy ’ pigs , with the animals becoming more playful and wagging their tails			1
to test that the animals were responding to each other ’s behaviour and not simply the music , the scientists played the naïve pigs the tune			1
they showed no signs of changing their behaviour , indicating they were showing empathy with the trained animals			2
the findings were published in the journal @entity199 .			0

scientists at @entity32 in the @entity33 demonstrated that pigs empathise with others that they share a pen with
the researchers trained some pigs to anticipate a reward or punishment
they found untrained pigs shared the stress and happiness of their mates
