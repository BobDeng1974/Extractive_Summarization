chemicals found in pvc flooring , plastic shower curtains , processed food and other trappings of modern life may be sapping women ’s interest in sex			1
a study has linked low libido with the additives used to soften plastics which are found in every home			1
women with the highest levels of phthalates in their bodies were more than twice as likely to say ‘ not tonight dear ’ as those with the lowest amounts			1
they are found in everything from @entity32 flooring and shower curtains to car dashboards – and may also be in our food			1
tiny particles can enter our systems either through breathing or eating			1
previous studies have linked them to diabetes and asthma			0
they have also been blamed for feminising the brains of baby boys and last year the @entity47 warned they have ‘ serious implications for health ’			0
the latest research , presented at the @entity52 ’s annual conference in @entity53 , suggests they are doing psychological , as well as physical , damage			0
in the first study of its kind , dr @entity59 , of the @entity60 in the @entity61 , measured levels of phthalates in the urine of 360 pregnant women in their 20s and 30s			1
she also asked them how often they lost interest in sex in the months leading up to their pregnancy			2
those with the most phthalates in their bodies were two and a half times as likely to say they had frequently lacked interest in sex as those with the least			1
she said : ‘ it is interesting because these are chemicals that we are all exposed to every day			2
they are throughout our environment and every person studied showed measurable levels			0
’ scientists are now warning the chemicals could have serious health risks ( file image ) dr @entity91 suspects that phthalates interfere with the production of sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone , both of which are involved in female libido			1
she said that learning more is of ‘ utmost importance ’ , adding : ‘ for a lot of women with loss of libido there is no obvious reason and it is important to know how these chemicals might contribute			1
’ she said that food is a significant source of phthalates , particularly processed and highly - packaged products			2
it is thought to get into into food from processing equipment and from packaging			0
dr @entity91 , who tried to avoid fast food when pregnant over fears that the chemicals it contains would harm her unborn baby , said : ‘ one of the recommendations ... to potentially lower your exposure is to eat less processed food and to pick fresh things without packaging			2
’ other advice includes choosing natural wooden flooring over @entity32 and switching plastic shower curtains for glass screens			1
@entity135 , director of campaign group @entity136 , said it is ‘ highly likely ’ that phthalates are also found in @entity140 food			0
she said our exposure to them is ‘ constant ’ because they are used in so many products			0
however relationship expert dr @entity146 said many factors can influence a woman ’s libido , including smoking , medication , having a baby or changing jobs			0
a spokesman for the @entity155 , which represents manufacturers , said : ‘ we are not aware of any globally accepted tests which can yet measure the effect chemical exposure may have on libido			0
’ he added that phthalates are among the most researched chemicals and the use of any that affect fertility is restricted			2
certain phthalates are banned from use in cosmetics , toiletries and toys in the @entity170 and further restrictions are due next year .			0
