by @entity0 mechanics are given some nutty jobs , but this one beats them all			2
three grey squirrels had to be dragged kicking and squealing from a crumbling @entity6 wheel arch after they turned it into their nest			1
a video shows a bemused worker at a garage in @entity13 , @entity14 , extracting the snarling rodents one by one and hurling them into a box			1
they had chewed apart part of the fabric of the car and the arch was full of dead leaves by the time they were evicted			1
staff gathered round and held out a box for the startled animals to call their new home as the technician said wisely : ' when they growl like that they 're p * * * * d. ' the tale had a happy ending as all the squirrels survived intact			1
but there is a surprise at the end of the video - where the technician gets a huge shock while looking for their mother			1
tail with a happy ending : all three of the squirrels survived intact , despite making their nest in an unusual place @entity77 squirrels often gnaw their way through gutters to raise their litters in roofs , where they chew through insulation and electrical wires to cause a headache for their new neighbours			1
the use of cars is a bit less common - but when the animals are taken away from the countryside , where they nest in trees , there are sometimes few options			2
it is not the first time animals have infiltrated human transport			2
last week an entire train had to be evacuated in @entity101 after a snake made its way on board during the rush hour			0
all 450 passengers on the wednesday morning service from @entity108 to @entity109 in @entity101 had to leave after a 19.5in snake was spotted in one of the carriages			0
police were called , but thankfully the black garter snake was not venomous			0
last summer , meanwhile , a three - week old kitten survived a 1,000 - mile journey across two @entity118 states - inside the engine of a car			0
the cat was only discovered after the driver heard it meowing en route from @entity125 to @entity126			0
an animal rescue charity eventually freed the kitten after up to three days by sedating it with a ' jab stick ' and wiggling it out of the engine while wearing latex gloves			0
it had an infected eye but was expected to make a full recovery .			0
