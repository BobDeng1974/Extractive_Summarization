miss @entity15 said : ' after i was induced and went into labour the pain was far worse than anything i had experienced			0
' i knew something was n't right			0
i was so distracted with the pain i did n't notice the heart monitor and how low @entity28 's heart rate was dropping			1
' as soon as i realised , i called a midwife and she notified a doctor and i was rushed for a caesarean section			0
an independent report found staff at @entity21 , pictured , had not followed guidelines and failed to spot @entity28 's heart rate was dangerously low ' nothing can turn back the clock , but we just hope that the hospital trust has learned lessons so the same tragedy wo n't happen again			1
' the trust offered its ' profound apologies for the failings in care provided ' to the couple , saying lessons had been learned			1
the report found staff had failed to identify the pregnancy as high risk despite miss @entity15 's first baby @entity47 being delivered by @entity89			2
