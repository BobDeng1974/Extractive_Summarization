by @entity0 within weeks of returning home from @entity3 , @entity1 felt something wriggling in her stomach a @entity7 woman returned from doing charity work in @entity3 to find flesh - eating maggots living - and wriggling - in her stomach			1
@entity1 , 28 , from @entity10 , visited @entity11 to better understand how the charity she worked for in the @entity7 was helping the @entity15 country 's inhabitants			1
when she returned to the @entity7 and discovered several bites on her body she was n't worried - but as one turned yellow she thought she should investigate it further			1
squeezing the lesion revealed she was infested with the larvae of the tumbu fly which gorge on human flesh			1
' there were just a few red circles that looked like bites [ when i was in @entity11 ] , but when i got home i found more , ' she said			2
' when i found a yellow one on my stomach i just thought it was just a small infected bite with pus and thought squeezing it might help , ' ' but as i squeezed i felt something pull back [ into the skin ]			1
i immediately thought there was something wrong			2
' @entity1 immediately called her husband @entity36 and asked him to help			2
' i called for him to grab some tweezers and then asked him if he could pull out whatever it was that was moving under my skin if i squeezed			2
' @entity36 then pulled out a large maggot			0
' i started screaming and saying " no , no , please tell me it 's not a maggot ! "			0
@entity36 then looked at me and said " i think we need to go to hospital " , ' she recalled			0
experts say that to prevent being infested it is important to tumble dry or iron wet clothes when in the tropics to kill tumba fly eggs @entity1 left ) picked up the maggots when she visited the @entity11 to better understand how the charity she worked for was benefiting the @entity15 country 's inhabitants @entity1 discovered she was infested when she asked her husband , @entity36 , to use a tweezers to pull out what was wriggling in her abdomen ( @entity65 pictured )			1
@entity36 immediately took her to hospital the tumbu fly is found across the tropics and can cause a condition called myiasis , when the larvae feed on a host			1
the female tumbu fly lays its eggs on damp clothing or towels			1
if damp fabrics come into contact with human skin , the eggs penetrate the skin			1
to prevent catching the larvae , clothes should be tumble - dried or , if they are left to dry outside , ironed , as the heat kills the eggs			0
after two or three days , the larvae hatch beneath the skin			0
once born , the larvae need air to breathe so they eat their way out of their host			0
this can cause significant pain and irritation to the surrounding tissue			0
it is well - documented that people become infested - @entity100 is full of cilps - with tumbu maggots while abroad and many try to remove them by squeezing			0
but this can be dangerous as the maggot can split in half and rot underneath the skin triggering an infection instead , the best way to get rid of the maggots is to cover the wound with @entity113			0
this cuts off the maggot 's air supply causes it to surface			0
before they sought medical help @entity36 and @entity1 managed to pull out a further six maggots			2
@entity1 's ordeal features in a new @entity123 documentary , called ' bugs , bites and @entity126 ' that follows the work of specialists who are faced with patients exhibiting a variety of mysterious symptoms - more often than not from people who have travelled abroad			1
@entity1 visited @entity134 's @entity133 , a world leader in the field of mysterious illnesses			2
in the programme @entity1 presents the maggots in a small bottle for specialist registrar dr @entity141 to analyse			2
@entity143 , they are still alive and writhing			0
further inspection reveals that they are in fact tumbu larvae , flesh - eating maggots that burrow under a person 's skin to feast on flesh			2

this can cause significant pain and irritation to the surrounding tissue			0
@entity36 and @entity1 managed to extract six maggots - which can grow up to one cm long - before they arrived at the @entity180 's @entity134 where they presented their findings to specialist registrar dr @entity141 the small wounds can be come incredibly painful as the maggots gorge on flesh to reach the surface where they can breathe more easily and grow into mature flies for @entity1 it took 15 minutes for dr @entity189 to remove a further eight maggots from her body - bringing @entity1 's total maggot count to 14			1
it is well - documented - @entity100 is full of clips - that people become infested with tumbu maggots and many try to remove them by squeezing them out , much like an infected spot			0
but this can split the maggot in half and trigger an infection			0

this cuts off the maggot 's air supply and forces it to come to the surface for oxygen			0
after dr @entity189 's examination and extractions , @entity1 is ordered to carry out a daily body check each morning for a week			1
by the end of the week @entity1 is given the all - clear and says that she is already planning another trip to the same area			2
' the charity work i do is very important and nothing - not even flesh - eating tumbu flies - is going to stop me from doing it , ' she said .			1

@entity1 , from @entity10 , returned from doing charity work in @entity3 with what looked like several , *harmless* bites
but as one turned yellow she thought she should squeeze it to clean it
as she squeezed , she felt something wriggle and retreat inside her body
she had become host to the tumbu fly which lays its eggs on damp clothing in the @entity251 and once hatched feasts on human flesh
