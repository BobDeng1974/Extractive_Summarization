an examination of a mountain lion killed by a @entity3 official has found that it was a 125 - pound male that appeared to be young and healthy			1
but @entity3 officials still do n't know whether it was a wild animal or one that escaped from captivity			1
an agency officer thought it best to ' dispatch ' the mountain lion after a concerned farmer spotted it in northern @entity16 on monday			1
@entity23 says the lion was killed because it was roaming free near a populated area , making it a public safety issue			1
' if that cat had left that tree , it would have disappeared into the brush and it was a fairly populated area , ' @entity23 told the @entity38			1
' i do n't see any reason why it should n't be handled that way			2
' he said if the mountain lion was a wild animal , it apparently would be the first one confirmed in @entity21 since before the @entity47			1
' but that is a pretty big if , '' he said			2
' they took some measurements today , but that 's certainly not enough to go on without looking at everything in total			0
' ' dispatch it ' : the animal was treed by a dog in northern bourbon before a wildlife official chose to ' dispatch it ' out of public safety concerns @entity61 , a staff biologist for the @entity62 , disagrees with @entity64 's assessment			1
' if you 're a deer , they 're a little dangerous			0
if you 're a human , not so much , ' she told the @entity38			0
' attacks on people are not that common			0
there have only been 22 deaths in the last 120 years			0
' the animal 's dna will be sent to an out - of - state wildlife lab to determine whether its genetic material matches any wild populaitons			2
' they can determine the origin , ' @entity23 said , though it wo n't be fast			0
he said it could take weeks to get an answer			0
mountain lions , which also are known as cougars and panthers , are the largest cats found in @entity88			1
they were once native to the area but are most relegated to western states			2
they are now believed to number around 30,000 in @entity88 .			0

a @entity3 official near @entity95 , @entity21 responded to the call about a young male mountain lion in a tree and though it best to ' dispatch it '
once native to the state , cougars have not been spotted there since before the @entity47
an agency spokesman said , ' it seemed to be in very healthy condition ' and that shooting it was the *proper* course of action
