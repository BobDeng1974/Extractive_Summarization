@entity0 has questioned the commitment of young @entity3 players to the national team cause , claiming there were certain individuals during his time at @entity8 who tried to find ways of skipping international duty			1
the @entity13 boss described the @entity15 and @entity16 teams who had knocked @entity18 out of the @entity19 as ' average ' and claimed @entity18 had more talent at their disposal than any other team in @entity24 @entity18 will fly home after playing @entity26 in their final group game on tuesday			1
@entity0 - once a strong contender for the @entity18 job only to see @entity30 picked ahead of him in 2012 - said he had been unimpressed by their opponents and could not understand how @entity18 had failed to deliver			1
tough night : @entity33 and @entity34 look on dejected during @entity18 's @entity19 defeat to @entity16 common problem : @entity0 claims that @entity18 boss @entity30 will have dealt with the same issue while working at club level he highlighted his experiences of managing @entity18 players while at @entity8 and recalled how some were very reluctant to represent their country			1
' i still think we go to tournaments , whether it be under - 17s , under - 19s , under - 21s , there are too many pull - outs , it seems to be everyone has got an excuse , and i can tell you when i was at @entity8 , when full internationals came around , there were two or three players who did not want to play for @entity18 , ' he told @entity58 's @entity57 programme			1
' they would come to me 10 days before the game and say , ' @entity61 , get me out of that game , i do n't want to play in that game '			0
that was how it was			0
i 'd say , ' you 're playing for your country , you should want to play '			0
' ( they would say ) ' nah , my girlfriend is having a baby in four weeks , i do n't want to play ' and that is the truth , so it makes you wonder			0
only going to get worse ? @entity0 believes more players will look to avoid playing for @entity18 in the future ' and i think it 's only going to get worse			1
you see the stick the @entity18 players get and they come home , they 're earning fantastic money at their clubs , they 're all playing in the @entity84			2
they think , " do we need the aggro ? " ' difficult to hear : @entity87 said @entity0 's comments ' sticks a knife through your heart ' @entity87 , who won only eight @entity18 caps in his career , said @entity0 's revelation ' sticks a knife through your heart '			1
but @entity0 , who gave his backing to @entity30 , could offer no other explanation for @entity18 's failure to reach the knock - out stages as he described @entity24 as ' not a difficult group '			1
' for @entity26 to top the group by beating @entity15 and @entity16 , that tells you all you need to know about the group , ' he added			0
' for me it 's the worst @entity15 team for years			0
@entity16 have two world - class strikers but then not too many players you 'd fancy in the @entity108 , let alone playing for your country			2
' we 've got good players , players who are good week - in , week - out in the @entity108			0
you look at half the other teams in the tournament and there are loads of players who come to the @entity108 and could n't get a game ... you know we 've got better players than them but for some reason with good manager after good manager , we just do n't get results			2
' asked about @entity128 chairman @entity127 's target of winning the @entity129 , @entity0 was dismissive			2
' good luck , ' he said			0
' are we kidding ? how are we going to go to @entity131 and win a @entity19 in heat we 'll struggle just to run around in ? not a prayer			0
