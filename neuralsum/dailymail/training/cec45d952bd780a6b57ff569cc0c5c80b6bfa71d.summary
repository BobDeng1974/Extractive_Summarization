by @entity0 published : 09:52 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 14:23 est , 4 april 2013 tragic : five - year - old @entity1 died of meningitis after two doctors failed to spot the signs of the killer bug a five - year - old girl who died from meningitis had been seen by two gps less than 48 hours before she died , an inquest heard today			1
the doctors thought @entity1 was suffering from viral gastroenteritis but in fact she had the deadly brain condition			1
the schoolgirl died in hospital on february 28 last year , the hearing at @entity14 heard			1
she had been examined by an out - of - hours gp on the night of february 26 and seen again the following morning by a doctor at her local surgery			1
three hours later @entity1 started fitting and was rushed to hospital where she later died			1
her mother , @entity21 , told the hearing in a written statement that she was concerned that none of the doctors who examined @entity1 had considered meningitis			1
' we had a meeting with a senior doctor and the @entity30 , a dr @entity31 , who suggested that @entity1 had been let down by the doctors treating her , ' she said			1
these feelings are echoed by myself and my entire family			0
' i am concerned that at no point did any of the @entity39 staff or any staff at the gp surgery inform me about meningitis and what to look out for			2
i believe now that she had signs and symptoms pointing to meningitis			0
' the inquest heard that @entity1 , from @entity48 , @entity49 , had first starting feeling unwell on the night of february 25 and was vomiting hourly			1
she was also tired and had developed a small pinprick rash on her abdomen and left upper leg			0
mrs @entity1 said that by the following afternoon @entity1 was still unwell and she called @entity39 - an out - of - hours gp service in @entity54			1
a doctor called back and having spoken to mrs @entity1 told her to give @entity56 - a brand of rehydration medication - and if she could not keep that down to ring back			1
when she was sick again mrs @entity1 telephoned back and was told to bring @entity60 and her daughter were seen by locum gp dr @entity62			1
anger : @entity21 and @entity65 with their surviving son @entity66			0
@entity1 's parents have criticised doctors who missed two chances to save their daughter 's life she told the inquest : ' i showed dr @entity62 the rash on @entity1 ’s chin , tummy , chest and leg and he simply pressed the rash with his finger and said it was caused by the virus @entity1 had			1
' to me dr @entity62 did not seem very interested in @entity1 or her illness			1
for a lot of the consultation he seemed to be staring at me looking blank as if he did n’t know what to do			0
' when i asked him what was wrong with @entity1 he said she had picked up a virus			1
he explained he would send us down to the hospital to be seen but this would be a four - hour waste of time			1
' he said it would be better for me to take @entity1 home and if she continued to be sick overnight i should take her to our family gp the next day			1
on the advice of dr @entity62 i took @entity1 home			1
' the following morning mrs @entity1 rang her doctors ’ surgery , @entity101 in @entity48 , asking for an appointment			1
@entity1 and her mother were seen by dr @entity104			1
mrs @entity1 said : ' @entity1 sat on my lap during the consultation and dr @entity107 took her temperature which was 37.8 degrees and listened to her chest			2
mourning : the @entity110 attend a memorial service for @entity1			2
she died from @entity113 meningococcal meningitis , a bacterial strain of the disease , just four days after she started developing symptoms ' while we were in the consultation room she was very agitated and she pulled a clump of hair out of her head			2
dr @entity107 did not pass comment on this or suggest it was anything to worry about			0
' i again highlighted @entity1 ’s rash which was still present in the various places on her body			2
dr @entity107 prodded the rash with her finger and said it was linked to the virus			0
she said children often come up in rashes when they have a virus			0
' dr @entity107 did seem to realise that i was very concerned about @entity1 and she told me to bring @entity135 back at 4pm if there was no change			2
all in all we were in the consultation room for about five minutes			0
' by lunchtime mrs @entity1 thought her daughter was suffering from appendicitis and decided to drive her to hospital			1
on route @entity1 started fitting and mrs @entity1 pulled over and called an ambulance and she was rushed to hospital			1
questions : mr and mrs @entity1 hold a photograph of their daughter			2
the youngster was taken to see two doctors during her short illness emergency teams rushed @entity1 to the @entity156 where she was treated with morphine and anti-inflammatories after doctors thought she may have had a stroke			1
a neurosurgeon was brought in from neighbouring @entity162 to carry out an operation to try to remove fluid from the brain - but the disease had taken hold and @entity1 ’s brain had swollen too much			1
@entity21 told the inquest : ' she was connected to a life support machine			0
we were told the brain surgery had been unsuccessful and her brain had swollen so much she was brain damaged			2
' leaving @entity1 in that hospital and knowing her heart was still beating was one of the hardest things i have ever had to do			1
' the @entity65 's have donated their daughter ’s organs to help others - her heart has been given to an eight - month - old baby , a three - month - old got her liver and many more will also benefit			2
' as a family we have been actively involved in fundraising for meningitis research since @entity1 's death , ' said mrs @entity1 , ' we miss @entity1 every day and want as many positives to come out of her death as possible			2
' dr @entity62 told the inquest he saw @entity1 at @entity162 in @entity49 and examined the rashes on her body but felt they were ' very , very small and inconspicuous ' and combined with other symptoms pointed to gastroenteritis			1
' i was concerned that she did look pale , ' he said			0
' the last thing i did was offer @entity1 a drink of water			2
' she drank it and that reassured me that i could send her home with advice to call us back if she worsened or did not get better the next day			0
' questioned by @entity208 coroner @entity207 , dr @entity62 said that with ' hindsight ' he would have sought further medical advice			0
' i thought i was dealing with viral gastroenteritis , ' he said			1
' i did not associate it with a meningitis rash			0
personally i have never seen a case like this before			0
' dr @entity216 , a consultant in children 's emergency medicine at @entity156 , said : ' my feeling at the time and in hindsight was that by the time she had her fit and was less responsive , her brain had reached a critical level of swelling and the disease had taken hold			0
' with an hour - and - a - half of the ambulance taking her to hospital there was nothing to be done			2
' her colleague dr @entity234 , a consultant in paediatric intensive care , told the inquest that had @entity1 been admitted to hospital earlier it was unlikely doctors would have been able to reverse the swelling to her brain			1
treatment : @entity156 where @entity1 died			1
the coroner at the inquest into her death recorded a narrative verdict dr @entity107 told the hearing that she examined @entity135 but was reassured that the rash on the girl 's body was not getting worse			0
' i did think about meningitis as the cause of the rash but discounted that at the time , ' she said			0
' the one thing that made me think that was the fact that the rash did not seem to have progressed			0
' she had been seen 12 hours previously and a rash was detected			0
i think i was reassured that it did not seem to have got particularly worse over that time frame			0
i had a chat with mum and i booked a review appointment at 4pm the same day			0
' dr @entity107 said it was not unusual for a child to be seen by doctors repeatedly over a short period of time			0
' i think that if there was no improvement during the day i would have asked the children 's hospital to review her , ' she said			0
coroner @entity207 recorded a narrative verdict			0
she said : ' i am mindful of @entity1 's presentation when she was seen by each doctor			1
i am also mindful of the evidence of the two consultants from the children 's hospital			0
' it is clear from their evidence that earlier intervention is better but what can not be said is whether earlier treatment would have resulted in a different outcome for @entity1			2
neither can we say exactly what would have happened if @entity1 had been admitted sooner			2
so based on the evidence i consider the appropriate verdict to be a narrative verdict			0
' the coroner said she would not be making any recommendations about preventing a similar tragedy from happening again in the future			0
rule 43 recommendations are made by coroners with the intention of preventing deaths and learning lesson from the cause of deaths			0
' during the inquest i have been mindful of @entity307 but having heard the evidence from the gp , taking into account the information provided to the practice since this event and training that has taken place , i do n't think rule 43 is appropriate , ' said ms @entity207 .			0

' doctors thought @entity1 was suffering from viral gastroenteritis '
was examined by out - of - hours @entity309 and also seen by doctor at local surgery
she later began fitting and was rushed to hospital where she died
