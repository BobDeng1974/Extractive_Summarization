welcome to @entity1 's future			1
on tuesday , in @entity4 , a game of football will be played			2
if @entity1 lose , it means nothing			1
if @entity1 win , it means nothing			1
if @entity1 draw - well , you get the idea			1
and not just because the @entity11 is over for @entity12 and his men			1
the @entity14 decided on friday , in the aftermath of an eight - day exit from meaningful tournament football in @entity18 , that victory and defeat were very over-rated qualities when assessing the success of a sports team			1
save me : @entity1 boss @entity12 talks to @entity25 at training on monday there were other factors , intangibles , concerning preparation and work across several years that had to be considered , too			1
' if it does n't matter who wins and who loses , then why do they keep score ? ' asked the great @entity38 coach @entity37 , a man with more quotable one - liners than @entity40 , yet @entity1 are moving beyond these earthbound measures of advancement			1
it is just as well , for the @entity45 experience is destined to be repeated two years from here			2
the qualification campaign for the 2016 @entity47 , with the finals expanded and downgraded to 24 teams , means it will get no easier to ascertain @entity51 progress in the coming months			2
team talk : @entity1 's manager @entity12 with the players on monday strength : @entity56 and @entity57 formed an exceptional partnership @entity1 must play @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 to qualify , knowing a top - two finish guarantees entry and third place affords a puncher 's chance via the play - offs			1
the only high quality opposition @entity1 will face between now and june 2016 , then , is in friendly games , and those results are notoriously deceptive			1
@entity1 have defeated @entity72 and @entity73 in their most recent non-competitive meetings and won against @entity75 in a friendly in 2008			1
there will be no way of knowing @entity1 's true standing until their next competitive game in finals football in 2016			1
everything that happens until that date lacks substance			2
coming here , the message was that @entity1 had battled through a difficult qualifying group , which allowed for false security			1
it was suspected that @entity90 and @entity91 were far from an exceptional pairing at centre - half , when compared to their predecessors : @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity96 and @entity97 , with @entity98 in the role of fifth @entity100			2
bottom line : @entity1 's whole defence struggled to cope in @entity18 yet , @entity1 had only conceded four goals in qualifying , it was pointed out			1
fewer than any country in @entity107 , bar @entity73			0
@entity90 and @entity91 were not perfect , but they could do a job			0
@entity1 's centre - halves , the whole defence in fact , were below the standard required			1
that is why the @entity11 , not the route to it , is the health check			1
@entity12 thinks it would be harsh to judge his work on two matches , but that is football 's bottom line			2
did @entity124 become a better coach because he won a single match , and with it @entity129 's 10th @entity128 final ? in a word : yes			2
the fear when @entity12 succeeded @entity132 was that he would turn @entity1 , not into @entity133 , nor even his overachieving @entity135 and @entity59 teams , but into @entity136			1
@entity12 did a very good job at @entity136 , but it was a job with limitations			0
@entity136 do not tolerate relegation , but they have no realistic ambitions of major success , either			2
if they finish safe and give it a go against the biggest clubs , it will be regarded as a good season			1
this is where @entity1 are now			1
high and mighty : @entity129 coach @entity124 celebrates @entity128 glory for @entity152 safety , read tournament qualification			1
@entity154 , the general secretary , summed up the dismal reprogramming that has taken place at the @entity14 when he announced before the tournament began that he believed @entity12 had done enough to justify seeing out his contract until 2016 just by getting to @entity18			2
the widespread acceptance of courageous defeat by @entity72 in @entity161 is another sign that @entity1 now regard themselves as small and provincial , unable to challenge the elite			1
@entity12 's final season at @entity136 began with a home game against the champions , @entity166			2
@entity167 put @entity166 ahead , but @entity168 was inexperienced and vulnerable , and @entity136 equalised through @entity169			0
limited success : @entity12 made sure @entity136 were safe from relegation they gave @entity166 a real game from there but , with nine minutes to go , an @entity173 cross that deflected once before going in off @entity174 handed @entity166 victory			2
it was agreed that @entity136 could have put more pressure on @entity181 after half - time , but had done pretty well in the circumstances and were perhaps unlucky not to earn a point against a classier team			0
there was definitely cause for optimism			0
in essence , that was the reaction to @entity1 's defeat by @entity72			1
even the same scoreline against @entity192 has produced no grand inquest			0
what began as realism is now the meek acceptance of defeat			0
the impossible job , we are now told			0
that is more expectation management			0
if it is impossible then the incumbent should step aside to make room for another candidate , who might entertain possibility			0
others see the green shoots of recovery in the next generation			0
yet this presumes on several fronts			0
any team that includes @entity215 or @entity216 presumes they will train on and make the team regularly at @entity166 under @entity219 , in a way they have not over the last three years			0
any team that includes @entity223 on the back of 26 appearances for @entity226 , presumes he will grow up to be @entity56 not @entity228 , who made 37 appearances for @entity1 at all levels from under 16 onwards , without quite fulfilling the outstanding promise of his youth			1
in the previous three @entity235 , the players with five caps or fewer are @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245			0
not everybody delivers on that early promise			0
any team that includes @entity249 presumes he avoids injury , and any wholly youthful starting @entity251 presumes depth below , as at all tournaments the law of averages dictates there will always be at least one significant injury , possibly more			0
call up : @entity257 and @entity249 will get the chance to impress against @entity45 on tuesday go through the motions : @entity1 prepare for final group game against @entity45 on tuesday @entity261 : @entity4 yet here we are			1
the @entity1 of the future gets its kicks from logistical efficiency			1
' the best prepared team at the @entity11 , ' we were told and that boast persists through back - to - back defeats			2
we wish to be judged on intangibles , when in sport there is a very finite measure of attainment			0
it 's called the score			2
it is immune to spin , management , foresight , hindsight , revisionism , criticism or any form of external pressure			0
by removing it from the equation , nothing is			0
win , so what ? lose , so what ? @entity291 came out of the lift at @entity1 's team hotel in @entity294 , in the aftermath of the defeat by @entity192			1
a fellow countryman asked how he was feeling			0
' what can you do ? ' he asked			0
actually , that should n't be a rhetorical question			0
there are books written on what you can do			0
indexed , cross-referenced , alphabetised			0
there are videos and coaching sessions , debates and discussions , and plans a , @entity311 , @entity312 , probably through to @entity313 there is always something you can do			0
yet @entity1 's right - back is a man of our times			1
what can you do , eh ? he should have an @entity14 blazer			0
he 'd fit right in .			0

if @entity1 qualify for a tournament and and give it a go against the big sides , then it 's regarded as a success
the only high quality opposition @entity1 will face between now and @entity332 is in friendly games
the @entity11 and not the route to the finals is the *barometer* and @entity1 's whole defence was not up to standard
