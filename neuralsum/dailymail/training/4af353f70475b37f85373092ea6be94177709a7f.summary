by @entity0 published : 23:59 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 21:24 est , 28 january 2013 lucky : this is six - month - old @entity2 who was rescued after his buggy was swept into the sea by a freak gust of wind a baby who was blown into the sea in his buggy is expected to make a full recovery , his father said yesterday			1
@entity2 , aged six months , was in the icy water for ten minutes after a gust of wind caught the buggy			1
he is thought to have spent several of those minutes face down in the freezing water before a heroic harbour master dived in to save him			1
@entity17 , 63 , managed to turn the floating buggy upright and drag it against the harbour wall			1
onlookers then pulled the child to safety before he was taken to hospital			0
he is said to be making amazing progress despite the length of time he spent in the water			0
yesterday the baby ’s father spoke of the ‘ pure euphoria ’ of finding his son had survived – and thanked all involved in the rescue			1
@entity35 , 35 , was at home while his partner @entity37 , 34 , took their son and dogs for a walk around the nearby marina at @entity43 in @entity44			2
a gust of wind swept the buggy off the sea wall and @entity2 , strapped in his seat , fell face - down into 12ft of water			1
miss @entity37 ’s screams of ‘ my baby ! my baby has gone in the water , ’ were heard by mr @entity17			1
mr @entity57 is pictured at the harbour relieved : @entity35 , 35 , the father of baby @entity2 , stands at the spot where his son was flung into the water			1
@entity63 , 43 , who performed cpr on the baby , is pictured right he said : ‘ when i got there the mum was screaming and i saw the buggy floating			2
' the tide was going out and the current was strong			0
it was slowly floating away , being swept out to sea			0
’ dismissing suggestions he had behaved heroically , mr @entity17 , who has worked at the marina for 11 years , added : ‘ i did n’t have time to think			1
i ca n’t believe the baby survived			2
’ ten minutes seems an incredibly long time for such a young child to be in the freezing sea and survive			0
one theory is that an air pocket formed between the water and the back of the floating buggy , allowing @entity2 to continue to breathe			1
it is also thought that the bodies of young children are especially efficient at going into shock			0
a baby ’s smaller body slows down the metabolism more quickly than an adult ’s and therefore protects the vital organs from being starved of oxygen			2
in fact , many hospitals deliberately cool new born babies who have been starved of oxygen during birth			0
one of the young family ’s neighbours , @entity63 , 43 , then performed cpr on @entity2 until emergency crews arrived and an air ambulance flew him to @entity106 , in @entity107			2
mr @entity2 recalled the moment on sunday morning when he was at home and heard sirens from the marina			1
he said : ‘ i looked up the road to see what the noise was and saw my friend @entity115 who looked absolutely distraught and just shouted at me “ it ’s your baby , it ’s your baby ”			0
’ mr @entity2 ran down to the marina where he saw his son being tended to on the ground			1
he said : ‘ i ca n’t stress how amazing @entity17 was , and @entity63 as well			2
’ mr @entity2 added that @entity2 had astounded doctors with his recovery and he was expected home in the next few days			1
‘ all the doctors and nurses said he is doing fantastic , ’ he said			0
‘ they have all been brilliant			0
‘ i ’m feeling overwhelmed			0
