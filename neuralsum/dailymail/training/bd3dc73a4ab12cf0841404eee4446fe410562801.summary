by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 05:33 est , 7 january 2013 most couples who renew their wedding vows do so several years after they first step down the aisle			2
but @entity4 and @entity5 are not a couple with time on their side			1
their vow renewal on a beautiful @entity11 beach last october , just a year after they first married , was a symbol of just how much time they might have left together			1
for @entity4 , 30 , has been told she may have just three months to live , after being diagnosed with terminal malignant melanoma			1
@entity17 says being told she had terminal cancer made her realise boyfriend @entity5 ( pictured ) was the love of her life			1
the couple married in october 2011 but while she is clearly devastated at her diagnosis , she also believes it has made the last few months of her life some of the best			1
put simply , she says : ‘ being told i had terminal cancer made me realise @entity5 was the love of my life			1
‘ suddenly everything becomes very clear and you realise exactly what it is you want			2
’ until then , the couple , who have been together for eight years , had been unsure of their future			2
as @entity4 explains : ‘ we always loved each other but it just did n’t work the first couple of times we lived together			1
i am quite bohemian and a hoarder of stuff and @entity5 is the total opposite			1
we also had different outlooks on life , to some degree			2
the couple enjoyed a 30 's @entity46 glam - style themed wedding			1
until her diagnosis , they had been unsure of their future ‘ i was also badly affected by the death of my father at the beginning of 2009 as he was the person who basically brought me up and we were extremely close			0
' being told i had terminal cancer made me realise @entity5 was the love of my life ' ‘ after that , i had a burning desire to have children to continue @entity59 ’s blood line			1
but @entity5 was n’t ready to have a family and that caused a huge rift between us			1
‘ in hindsight , it really was n’t the right time to go about it , as i was incredibly raw			0
‘ now we ’ve made it work because we ’ve realised how much we love each other			0
’ the couple , who live in @entity70 , @entity71 , met in april 2005 in a nightclub			1
‘ it was a very cheesy nightclub and we both stood out like sore thumbs , ’ @entity4 told @entity73			1
‘ we ’d both been dragged along by the groups of friends we were with			0
but we got talking and just clicked			0
he took my number and we went on a date shortly afterwards			0
’ over the next few years they had a couple of minor breakups , but always remained friends			2
and they were back together when in october 2010 , @entity4 found a lump near her groin			1
‘ i spoke with @entity5 and he encouraged me to go see a doctor , ’ she recalls			1
‘ neither of us dreamed it could be cancer			0
shock diagnosis : very fair skinned , @entity4 has never been a tanner and was always careful in the sun ' my doctor agreed - i was too young and had lived a healthy lifestyle , so he was sure it was nothing sinister			1
but as a precaution , he decided to run a few tests			0
' ' i just could n't believe what i was hearing ... it was like being smacked around the face ' she began to feel uneasy when she was called in for a biopsy – and rightly so , for the news that followed was shattering			2
the biopsy had revealed malignant melanoma in her lymph nodes			1
‘ it was such a shock as i have never been a tanner – i just could n’t believe what i was hearing , ’ she says ‘ it was like being smacked around the face			0
‘ my mind was whirring with questions – when had it started , how had i got it when i ’d always been so careful in the sun ? ’ doctors told her the primary site of the melanoma was in the middle of the ball of her foot			1
‘ looking back , i had felt very run down , but i put that down to my busy job as a special needs teacher working with autistic children , commuting and the stress of @entity59 dying , ' she says			0
‘ i was warned from the start that it was n’t good			0
i was pretty much slap bang in the middle of stage three , advanced cancer and was already very ill. ’ the couple renewed their vows in @entity11 last october , just a year after they first married			1
@entity4 's blue wig is to symbolise the @entity139 theme @entity4 immediately underwent major surgery at the @entity141 to remove 37 lymph nodes , before undergoing chemotherapy			1
' i am so grateful for every day we have together ' but that failed to stop the cancer spreading and just seven months later , in may 2011 , she received the devastating news that the cancer was terminal			1
‘ when i heard the news , all i could think about was @entity5 , ’ she recalls			1
‘ we ’d broken up again in the january but now everything seemed so clear , and i had to be with him			0
‘ he was at work and i could n't bear to tell him over the phone			0
i waited for him to come around to my house and when i told him my prognosis we hugged and cried and told each other how much we loved each other			2
‘ it was then that i realised that the man in front of me really was the love of my life and before i knew it , i was telling him i wanted to marry him			0
he felt the same and proposed then and there			0
‘ suddenly , everything became very clear and i no longer cared about anything in the past or the silly rows we ’d had			0
‘ i knew regardless of what happened @entity5 would always be there for me			1
he was my rock , the one person who could cheer me up no matter what			0
@entity4 says : ' when i do pass away i will be happy because in @entity5 i have found the love of my life and nothing else matters			1
i am so grateful for every day we have together ' precious moments : @entity4 and @entity5 , seen on a boat trip , met in a nightclub in april 2005 ‘ i just knew that i wanted to marry him , have a fabulous day celebrating our love and enjoying the time we had left together			1
’ not knowing how long she he had left , @entity4 set about planning her 30 ’s @entity46 glam - style wedding			1
and in october 2011 she and @entity5 , 36 , who works for a luxury mobile phone company , married in front of their friends and family in a @entity70 boutique hotel			1
‘ it was the best day of my life and i could n't have been happier , ’ says @entity4			2
‘ it was n’t about getting a piece of paper , it was about celebrating our love with friends			0
' brave : @entity4 hopes her story will serve as a cautionary tale to those striving to get a sun tan since her diagnosis , @entity4 has also thrown herself into travelling the world , visiting destinations such as the @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 and the @entity208			2
and in october , the couple celebrated their first anniversary by having a blessing in @entity11 – the destination of their first holiday			2
having lost her hair due to radiotherapy on her brain , after tumours were also discovered there , @entity4 decided to embrace the @entity139 theme and wear a blue wig			2
‘ i just thought “ if i ’m going to wear a wig , why not wear a fabulous blue one and do the @entity139 look ”			0
' she has chosen to share her story now to try and prevent others suffering a similar fate			0
‘ i just want to make sure people do n’t get to my stage			0
i have always been fair skinned and never a tanner , but i must have been burnt on my foot at some stage and that ’s what triggered the cancer , although i have no recollection of it			0
‘ i was always very careful , wearing factor 30			0
so look after yourself and do n’t sacrifice your life for a tan			0
i ca n’t stress enough how much it ’s not worth it			0
’ she is now planning her 31st birthday in march as her next milestone to reach , and something to focus on			0
‘ but i know that if i do pass away i will be happy because in @entity5 i have found the love of my life and nothing else matters			2
i am so grateful for every day we have together			0
