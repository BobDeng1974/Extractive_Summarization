a northern @entity13 council announced monday that @entity14 and @entity15 will no longer be allowed to lead scouting troops due to what happened october 11 at @entity18 , which they filmed and posted on @entity20			1
in another twist , one of the men has links with convicted killer @entity25 and appeared on @entity27 throughout her trial			1
connection : @entity15 was a close friend of murdered man @entity25 @entity15 was a close friend of victim @entity25 and spoke about his mistrust of the woman who was eventually convicted for stabbing him 29 times , shooting him in the face and slitting his throat			1
' there was just something really weird about [ @entity25 ] , and when she spent time with you , you even got more creeped out , ' @entity15 told @entity27 ’s @entity42 in january			1
' just the way she acted in our home			2
the way that she had this awkward silence about her			2
the way that she just had no soul			2
you could almost see through her			2
it ’s not someone you could sit down with and have a conversation			2
the move by the @entity13 ' @entity5 chapter comes on the heels of the national @entity78 condemning the men 's actions last week and promising a review of the incident			2
the @entity83 posted a statement on its website saying the men 's actions are not in line with the principles the organization teaches about preserving nature			2
' we encourage all leaders and scouts to review the " @entity96 " principles , as we are all a part of maintaining the integrity , character and the natural beauty of the outdoors for all living things , ' the statement said			1
the rock formation they toppled over is about 170 million years old , @entity104 spokesman @entity103 said			2
the central @entity5 park is dotted with thousands of the eerie , mushroom - shaped sandstone formations			2
@entity15 and @entity14 came under fire last week after posting a video on @entity20 where @entity14 can be seen wedging himself between a formation and a boulder to knock a large rock off the formation 's top			1
@entity14 and his two companions can then be seen cheering , high - fiving and dancing			1
they said the rock formation was loose and they feared it was dangerous			2
they were leading a group of teenage @entity13 on a trip when it happened			0
@entity15 said they found out about losing their @entity13 positions monday morning			1
they had been troop leaders for a few years , @entity15 said , and hope to continue to be involved in organization in the future using what happened as a teaching point			1
both men are from @entity135 , @entity5 , about 30 miles south of @entity136			0
' we 've always supported the @entity13 and if that 's what they feel is best , we support that decision , ' @entity15 said			1
' we 're extremely sorry for our mistake			0
we look forward to doing everything we can to make it right and move on			0
' @entity104 authorities are conducting a criminal investigation , and the @entity146 also is reviewing the incident to determine if charges should be filed			1
caught on camera : @entity14 is filmed pushing the ' loose ' rock in @entity18 destroyed : the massive rock , which had been in place for 20 million years , crashes to the ground beneath celebration : @entity14 and @entity61 high - five while the cameraman , @entity15 , laughs and whoops for joy speaking to the @entity158 , mr @entity15 said he has received dozen of death threats in the past week			1
' i ’ve got over 100 death threats on the internet already , ' said mr @entity15			1
' i ’ve got people all over the world telling me they are going to kill me because i made the decision that lives are more important than this rock staying here a few more hours , ' he added			0
despite attracting possible criminal charges and the continuing hatred of people across the globe , mr @entity15 continued to defend his group 's actions			1
' i think we made the right decision , but probably the wrong method , ' he explained to the @entity158			0
' we take full responsibility for whatever mistake we made , and we ’re open to whatever that means from the state , from the @entity13 ’ office , etc. ' the rock formations at @entity18 in @entity5 are thousands of years old , formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock proud : the men said they were ' saving lives ' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child showing off : @entity14 , a boy scout leader , flexes his muscles after forcing the rock from its perch a criminal investigation is now underway in the incident , which occurred on october 11 , spokesman @entity103 told the @entity158			1
' it is not only wrong , but there will be consequences , ' he said			0
' this is highly , highly inappropriate			0
this is not what you do at state parks			0
it ’s disturbing and upsetting			0
' deputy @entity210 attorney @entity209 said he was aware of the incident but that it has not yet reached his office			0
if it does , he will consider whether to bring charges			1
he said they could face anywhere from a class b misdemeanor ( up to six months in prison ) to a second - degree felony ( one to 15 years in prison ) depending on how much the formation is valued , the @entity158 reported			2
he added : ' some things ca n’t be replaced , like photographs in a family album , but they have great sentimental value			0
' but the men insist that they only pushed the rock to the ground because it was unstable and they were concerned about it crushing a child playing nearby			0
on the video , @entity15 says : ' some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and @entity14 saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way			1
so it ’s all about saving lives here at @entity18			0
' @entity14 said he had seen a family walk close to the rock and when he touched it , it was loose			1
' i put my hand on a rock and it moved , ' he said			0
' while we were sitting right there we thought , " man if this rock falls it ’ll kill them "			0
' i did n’t have to push hard			0
' but when they left , he said he thought that he probably should have contacted a ranger before taking action			0
but the men said they had only seen one in the park that day			0
@entity18 is more than 3,600 acres of desert with hoodoo rock formations in @entity5 stunning : the rock formation at @entity18 , pictured , was 20 million years old still , they apologized for their actions and said they wish they could have dealt with it differently			0
' glad we did it , wish we would n’t have done it , ' @entity14 said			1
@entity15 added : ' we 're extremely sorry for our actions			1
there was no in way shape or form any intent to go out there and cause any harm to our natural resources			0
' @entity277 added that seeing a loose rock does not mean a person should push it over			0
