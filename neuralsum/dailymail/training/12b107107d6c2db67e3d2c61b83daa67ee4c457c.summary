a furious @entity1 professor has gone to extreme measures to recuperate $ 4 from a @entity4 restaurant he claims overcharged him			1
@entity5 - an associate professor of business administration for the prestigious - ordered $ 53.53 worth of takeout from @entity9 in @entity10 on friday , but was shocked when the pill was $ 4 more than he had added up using the online menu			1
he emailed the restaurant , who admitted that their website was ' out of date ' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $ 1 , causing @entity5 to send a barrage of threatening emails that have now been made public by @entity21 ' under @entity4 law it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price , ' @entity5 wrote			1
angry emailer : @entity5 , an associate professor of business administration at @entity1 , has unleashed a string of angry and threatening emails to @entity9 , claiming they overcharged him $ 4 and it was illegal ' i urge you to cease this practice immediately			1
' in the interim , i suggest that @entity9 refund me three times the amount of the overcharge			2
' the tripling reflects the approach provided under the @entity4 consumer protection statute , @entity43 , wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations			2
' please refund the $ 12 to my credit card			1
or you could mail a check for $ 12 to my home			1
' @entity5 recieved an apologetic reply about an hour later from @entity52 , the son of the restaurant 's owners who manages the @entity55 , located inside the @entity57 location of @entity9			1
' we are a mom and pop restaurant and we pride ourselves on hard work and authentic @entity9 cuisine , ' @entity52 wrote			1
' i will honor the website price and honor you the $ 3.00			2
' however this only seemed to infuriate @entity5 further			2
apologetic : @entity52 , the son of the restaurant 's owners who manages the @entity55 , located inside the @entity57 location of @entity9 , responded to @entity5 in a courteous way scene : @entity5 had ordered takeout from the @entity9 in @entity10 ( pictured ) ' it strikes me that merely providing a refund to a single customer would be an extremely light sanction for the violation that has occurred , ' @entity5 wrote back			1
' to wit , your restaurant overcharged all customers who viewed the website and placed a telephone order – the standard and typical way to order takeout			2
' you did so knowingly , knowing that your website was out of date			2
' you do n't seem to recognise that this is a legal matter and calls for a more thoughtful and far - reaching resolution			0
' nor do you recognise the principle , well established in applicable laws , that when a business intentionally overcharges a customer , the business should suffer a penalty larger than the amount of the overcharge			0
' @entity52 , who appeared in a recent issue of @entity100 hailed as ' @entity101 ' , responded with an obvious question : ' you seem like a smart man			0
but is this really worth your time ? ' again , @entity5 came back firing			2
' you 're right that i have better things to do , ' @entity5 's replied			0
' if you had responded appropriately to my initial message – providing the refund i requested with a genuine and forthright apology – that could have been the end of it			0
' the more you try to claim your restaurant was not at fault , the more determined i am to seek a greater sanction against you			0
' not happy : @entity5 went to great lengths to get the restaurants to credit him $ 12 over the so - called mishap @entity5 ' passed the matter on to the authorities ' in @entity10			1
@entity52 wrote back : ' once again thank you for bringing it to my attention , i will wait for proper authorities to direct me on how to resolve this situation			0
' once they direct me on how to resolve this situation with you , we will be able to honor the price that they advise me on			0
. ' i will make a note that you seek out 50 percent off your total meal bill			0
' i have no issues with honoring 50 percent off your total bill if the authorities see fit			0
' i hope you understand i want to go through the proper channels so we can resolve this properly			0
' i will keep you updated as soon as they contact me			0

@entity5 sent a statement to @entity154 saying he believes how he handled the situation with @entity9 was helping other people as well			1
' we all rely on trust in our daily lives , that when sales tax is added , it actually applies and equals the specified amount ; that the meter in a taxi shows the correct amount provided by law and correctly measures the actual distance ; that when you order takeout , the price you see online matches the amount you pay in the restaurant , ' he told the website			1
