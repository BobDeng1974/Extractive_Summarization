by @entity0 last updated at 6:05 pm on 1st january 2012 civil rights groups today voiced major concern over a defence bill allowing the military to indefinitely detain @entity6 citizens suspected of terrorism			2
the $ 662billion bill was signed by @entity9 on saturday despite his ‘ serious reservations ’ and pledging he would not support that element			1
but human rights advocates said the bill is a ‘ blight on his legacy ’ and ‘ dangerous because it has no temporal or geographic limitations ’			1
controversy : a $ 662billion defence bill was signed by @entity9 on saturday despite his ' serious reservations ' over the detention of @entity6 citizens ‘ @entity9 will go down in history as the president who enshrined indefinite detention without trial in @entity6 law , ’ a @entity23 spokesman said			1
the @entity29 is ‘ incredibly disappointed ’ but will see what the @entity31 rules on the ‘ scope of detention authority ’			2
‘ the statute can be used by this and future presidents to militarily detain people captured far from any battlefield , ’ an @entity29 spokesman added			0
civil rights advocates are worried the bill will help the military detain and interrogate @entity6 citizens and non-citizens , reported the @entity46			2
president @entity9 claimed some lawmakers wanted to use the bill to restrict counter-terrorism officials ’ ability to protect the country			1
he only signed the measure after @entity53 made changes that no longer challenged his terrorism - fighting ability , administration officials said			0
detention : a detainee rests inside his cell in @entity59 at the @entity60 , @entity61 ( file picture ) ‘ my administration will not authorise the indefinite military detention without trial of @entity6 citizens , ’ president @entity9 said			1
‘ indeed , i believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a nation , ’ he wrote in a signing statement			0
' @entity9 will go down in history as the president who enshrined indefinite detention without trial in @entity6 law ' @entity23 the defence bill also applies penalties against @entity80 's central bank in an effort to hamper its ability to fund its nuclear programme			1
his signature caps months of wrangling over how to handle captured terrorist suspects without violating @entity6 ' constitutional rights			0
the @entity89 initially threatened to veto the legislation but dropped the warning after @entity53 made some last - minute changes			0
the new law requires military custody for any suspect who is a member of @entity96 or ‘ associated forces ’ and involved in trying to attack the @entity6 disappointment : human rights advocates said the bill is a ' blight on his legacy ' and ' dangerous because it has no temporal or geographic limitations ' but the president or a designated subordinate may waive the military custody requirement by telling @entity53 it ’s for national security reasons			1
despite the changes , officials cited serious concerns that the law will complicate and could harm the investigation of terrorism cases			0
' my administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of @entity6 citizens ' @entity9 @entity119 officials have said they could have trouble persuading suspected terrorists to co-operate immediately and provide critical intelligence			1
