@entity0 , 66 , claims to own the moon and has made more than $ 10million selling acres of it since 1980 a businessman claiming to sell acres of land on the moon has made more than $ 10million from the venture			1
@entity0 , 66 , says he exploited a loophole in the 1967 @entity12 @entity11 treaty to claim ownership of the lunar landscape			1
he then divided it into plots and sold them in his local bar and over the internet via his company , @entity20 , for $ 20 ( £ 12 ) an acre , or $ 25 ( £ 15 ) including mineral rights			1
@entity24 actors @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 , and @entity29 creator @entity28 are said to be among his six million customers			1
presidents @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 have also had plots bought for them , while companies such as @entity36 and @entity37 have also invested			1
@entity38 has even set up his own state , the @entity40 , in 2004 , which has a ratified constitution , a congress , a unit of currency and even a patent office each owner gets a gold - embossed certificate and an entitlement to vote in any future elections			0
mr @entity0 , a former used car salesman , researched the law on land - grabs on @entity52 before writing to the @entity12 to lay claim to the moon			1
he did not receive a reply refusing his request , and therefore considers himself to have a legal right to the moon and all its minerals			1
he also claimed ownership of most of the other planets in the solar system , and their moons , at the same time			1
he said : ' i could n't help thinking that there was a lot of unclaimed property up there			0
' i was intrigued enough to look up the treaty and sure enough @entity72 states ' no nation by appropriation shall have sovereignty or control over any satellite bodies '			0
mr @entity0 says a loophole in the @entity12 @entity79 allowed him to claim ownership of the moon , and other planets because the treaty forbids countries from doing so , not individuals mr @entity0 has even set up his own government , the @entity40 , which has its own constitution and currency			1
he claims the state does n't have to abide by @entity12 laws because it is not a member ' i found a lot of countries accepted that land could be claimed so i just applied what i learned			1
' people have said just because the @entity12 never responded does n't mean you own it			2
well , i did my due diligence , they should have done theirs			0
' mr @entity0 , from @entity98 , came up with the idea of laying claim to the moon while on a cross-country drive in the late 1970s			1
he started selling the plots in his local pub before going online as the internet grew			2
he said : ' i 'd sit in bars , with a batch of deeds in my coat			0
i 'd get talking to someone and they asked what i did , i 'd say , " i sell the moon "			2
' it was a great conversation starter			0
i made a lot of sales that way			2
' mr @entity0 now has plans to build a giant pyramid on the moon , with room for thousands of visitors			1
he said it is unlikely anybody will live there permanently because it could lead to medical complications			0
mr @entity0 has so far sold moon land to to the likes of sci - fi master @entity28 , former president @entity33 and @entity131			1
each owner is given a certificate and the right to vote in any moon elections but he does believe people will have ' extended vacations ' of up to three months at a time to get the ' best views in the solar system '			2
a leisure company even plans to open an indoor golf course			0
@entity0 's biggest sale so far is 2.6 million acres to one person			1
but he says he turned down a ' massive ' offer - worth ' hundreds of millions of dollars ' - because the company wanted to buy the polar regions			0
mr @entity0 said : ' that 's where the frozen water is and they 're not for sale			2
any company that owned it would have a monopoly on the moon 's water supply and would exploit it			0
' the youngest land owner on the moon was a day old and the oldest 97			0
unsurprisingly , mr @entity0 's business venture has landed him in court on numerous occasions			2
he said : ' i 've been taken to court in @entity162 and @entity163 for fraud but both cases were thrown out of court because of lack of jurisdiction			0
' no court wants to tackle the issue yet , but i 'm sure they 'll be cases in the future			0
' others have sent him abusive letters and emails , and at least four bomb threats have been made against the business			0
he added : ' they call me a con man and a charlatan and that no one can own the moon for himself			0
' i just turn them over to the @entity184 and let them deal with them			0
' mr @entity0 claims to own the moon due to a legal loophole in the @entity12 @entity79 , but some legal minds beg to differ mr @entity0 claims he exploited a hole in the 1967 @entity12 @entity79 in order to claim ownership of the moon , most of the planets in the solar system , and their moons as well			1
he says the treaty only specifies that countries may not lay claims to ownership , but says nothing about individuals			2
so is owning an acre of the moon legal ? @entity205 of this treaty states : ' the activities of non-governmental entities in outer space , including the moon and other celestial bodies , shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate @entity213 to the @entity214			1
' so while mr @entity0 is not excluded under the country clause , he could be excluded because he has not been authroised by the @entity218 government			2
@entity220 - @entity219 , deputy director of the @entity221 , previously told the @entity222 that all @entity12 treaties apply to both countries and their citizens , which would disqualify mr @entity0 's claims			1
she added : ' @entity227 is doing does not give people buying pieces of paper the right to ownership of the moon			1
' however , @entity234 , a space analyst at @entity237 's @entity236 , explained to @entity238 in 2008 that the treaty has little legal power because it is too difficult to enforce			0
' these treaties do n't really have any teeth to them , ' he said			0
' they are agreements on principle			0
' in fact several governments , including that of @entity162 and @entity163 , have tried to prosecute mr @entity0 for fraud , but he says the cases have fallen flat over a lack of jurisdiction .			2
