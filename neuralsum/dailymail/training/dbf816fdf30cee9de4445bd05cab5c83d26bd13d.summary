by @entity0 in the quiet suburbs of @entity3 where the tech elite live , a modern day ark is taking shape			1
@entity6 , a designer , began thinking about the how his family could surive an event similar to the @entity9			1
now , he has almost finished his project - a giant ' tsunamiball ' that can float away from its perch in his back garden , keeping its occupants safe inside			1
the shell of the tsunamiball nears completion in @entity3 inside the ark : watertight portholes allow those inside to look out , and can be covered to allow sleep on the craft			1
the boat will be left in @entity6 's back yard , above the detached garage , several miles from the water			1
in the event of tsunami , he is confident it can withstand the initial impact of a tsunami from any direction while on land			1
it would them simply float on the surface of the water , with a double hull to protect it from surrounding debris			2
' @entity42 is intended to be a tsunami - proof boat , ' @entity6 said			1
' after the @entity46 tsunami in march of 2011 i started to wonder how a family might survive such a brutal and sudden event			1
' @entity6 then talked about the idea with friends , before he started sketching			0
' the project started as a series of creative conversations and sketches with friends about possible ways to escape a tsunami with your family intact , ' he said			1
' the tone was light and playful			0
ideas like helium balloon houses , and personal jet packs were exciting lunch time topics			0
' eventually the idea of a floating ball as an escape vessel was hatched			0
' @entity6 , who said his wife was behind the idea , then refined the designed , still unsure if it was possible - and if he 'd be able to make it			0
' from that idea , through a series of sketches and several hundred web searches birthed the concept that a tsunami - proof vessel was a possibility			2
' through the porthole : @entity6 working on the @entity42 , which he hopes to finish later this year @entity6 at work on the boat			2
he hopes to have it finished later this year			0
' with no boat building experience and almost no time spent on the water , this was more of a fantasy than a practical planning exercise , ' he admits			2
' but the more i researched , the more i expected i could build it , and i started to build in january of 2012			0
' i hope to finish sometime in late 2014			0
' the boat has a double hull to protect it from sharp objects and debris			2
' the idea for this boat is to have it in the back yard above the detached garage , several miles from the water , said @entity6			0
' the focus is on building a vessel that could withstand the initial impact of a tsunami from any direction while on land			0

boat will kept on a high ' perch ' in @entity3 garden in case a tsunami hits
has enough room for an entire family
in the event of a @entity9 , it simply floats with the wave
set to be rented out on @entity124 until *needed*
