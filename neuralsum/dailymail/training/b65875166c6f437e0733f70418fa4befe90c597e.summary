she was n’t exactly famed for her small - talk , but @entity1 nonetheless came up with a splendidly disarming icebreaker when she was first introduced to @entity3			1
it was the @entity5 , and our then prime minister had agreed to accompany her husband @entity8 to an intimate dinner with a business acquaintance of his , called @entity11 , and his new wife			2
worryingly , for all concerned , that new wife just happened to be @entity14 — the former model and nightclub dancer who , as a key player in the @entity18 , had come within a whisker of bringing down a @entity21 government			1
@entity38 - married , she had , just a few years earlier , at the age of 38 , starred in an x-rated erotic film called @entity40 , based on @entity42 ’s book of the same name			1
yet if @entity1 was in any way put off by this femme fatale ’s track record , she did n’t show it			1
instead , shortly after shaking hands , the prime minister turned to @entity14 and asked a question			2
‘ tell me , ’ she asked , ‘ how do you manage to keep your lipstick on ? ’ this was , @entity55 later told friends , a serious question			2
‘ @entity3 always used to wear very full lipstick , and it would never rub off , ’ says the journalist @entity57 , a longstanding acquaintance			1
‘ i think mrs @entity1 genuinely wanted to know how she managed that			1
’ it would also prove a superbly - effective way of the @entity63 setting her nervous guest at ease			2
for the ensuing chat marked the start of a fond personal friendship between these outwardly very different women			1
throughout the friendship , @entity14 and her husband , @entity11 , ( pictured ) spent time abroad with the former prime minister and her husband following @entity14 ’s death from cancer last week at the age of 70 , it has emerged that this unlikely duo would eventually become so well - acquainted as to spend time on holiday together in the @entity82			1
though she never spoke publicly about their relationship , and succeeded in keeping it from being reported by the @entity88 during @entity8 ’s lifetime , it appears that @entity14 counted photographs of those trips among her most valued possessions			2
she kept two of them — one in a tartan frame — at the flat in @entity97 , @entity98 , where she and @entity11 stayed when they were n’t at their home in @entity101 , @entity102 , or their holiday homes in the @entity105 and @entity106			1
‘ there was one picture of @entity3 and @entity1 together , and one of them and their two husbands , i think standing on some sort of balcony , ’ says the author @entity114 , who visited the flat in 1996			1
‘ i think she kept one on her desk , and one on the sitting room wall			0
what i found interesting was that @entity3 would always be very forthcoming when you asked her a question — very open and honest			1
but when i asked , she would hardly talk about the pictures at all			0
it was almost as if the friendship was one of the few things in her life she wanted to keep secret			1
’ @entity114 , who visited the flat while researching a biography of @entity133 , matriarch of @entity134 , the stately home where the @entity137 scandal played out , was n’t the only writer to get a tantalising insight into the two couples ’ secret relationship			1
the historian @entity142 , who recently published a book on @entity137 , told in an obituary of @entity14 published at the weekend , how @entity8 , who sat alongside @entity11 on the board of a @entity147 waste disposal firm called @entity148 , also became a regular visitor to their home			1
‘ during the @entity153 years , @entity8 would pop over for cheery drinking sessions in the @entity155 ’ @entity98 home when he felt bored or neglected , ’ he wrote			0
during that first dinner at which the two women met , @entity8 was less talkative than usual , @entity142 believes			2
‘ she fixed her eyes on @entity3 , gazed intently at her , trying to pierce the secrets of her very different brand of femininity , both intrigued and guarded in the company of a @entity165 icon			1
’ yet for all their outward differences , @entity14 and @entity8 were in many important ways cut from the same cloth			0
‘ @entity3 loved human comedy — and appreciated it more saucily than @entity1 , ’ added @entity142			1
‘ but the two women had many splendid similarities			2
‘ they faced the hostility that is often meted out to game - changing innovators			0
they refused to take the world on men ’s terms — and in their very different spheres they left it a very different place			0
’ both women came from humble backgrounds and were raised by small businessmen in provincial @entity183			2
@entity1 is pictured with her husband , @entity8 it is thought @entity8 would visit the @entity186 at their home for drinking sessions while his wife was prime minister both came from humble backgrounds , and were raised by small businessmen in provincial @entity183			1
@entity14 grew up in suburban @entity191 , the daughter of a former policeman who set up a tyre - sales business			0
@entity8 ’s father was a shopkeeper in @entity196 , @entity197			0
both also demonstrated an uncanny knack of ( and perhaps passion for ) upsetting the @entity200			0
@entity14 was 16 years old when she decided , in 1960 , to move to @entity202 in search of adventure			0
after getting a job as a nightclub hostess , she met the notorious slum landlord @entity207 , who was 41 , overweight and very rich , and installed her as his mistress			0
following @entity207 ’s death two years later , she and a striking 19 - year - old friend , @entity210 , moved into a @entity202 flat owned by @entity212 , a society osteopath			0
within weeks , they were at the centre of a scandal that threatened to bring down the government after it emerged that @entity210 had slept with both @entity218 , the secretary of state for war , and @entity220 , a @entity222 naval attache			2
though never directly implicated in the @entity137 affair , @entity14 was called to give evidence at a court case in which @entity212 was accused of living off the ‘ immoral earnings ’ of his two tenants — a charge that implied , wrongly , that they were prostitutes			1
in the witness box at the @entity231 , she then made the sensational claim that one of her lovers had been @entity235 , @entity133 ’s husband and the owner of @entity134			0
when it was put to her that @entity235 denied this , she retorted : ‘ well he would , would n’t he ? ’ the response was remarkable for its impertinence in an era when working - class girls were not supposed to traduce the reputations of wealthy men			0
it has since entered the @entity247 , and is said to have hastened the upending of traditional class hierarchies in the @entity250			0
in a different sphere and era , mrs @entity1 was similarly unsettling to the old order			1
the first woman prime minister , her decision to contest the @entity21 leadership in 1975 upset a raft of @entity200 figures on her own front bench			0
both women were , of course , known for their free - thinking			2
@entity1 , pictured aged 25 ( left ) when she stood as the conservative candidate for @entity264 , and @entity3 ( right ) who left home for @entity202 aged 16 in office , @entity8 spent much of her reign challenging political orthodoxies			1
@entity14 devoted much of her life to challenging social ones			0
in numerous interviews , for example , she would highlight the inherent unfairness in the fact that men were admired for having sexual experiences , while women were scorned for it			2
were it not for their independent spirits , they would perhaps never have met			0
for a less free - thinking prime minister than @entity8 might have shied away from any association with @entity14 , for fear of the negative publicity it might attract			0
that , however , is not how the @entity288 operated			0
‘ mrs @entity291 was very open - minded , ’ is how her former private secretary @entity289 puts it			0
‘ she would n’t have refused to go along somewhere or to meet someone because of their reputation			0
she took people as she found them			0
’ so it proved with @entity3			1
and while few @entity21 grandees would like the two ladies to be mentioned in the same breath ( ‘ i ’m not sure if opening your legs is the same thing as reforming the economy , ’ comments one long - time @entity8 confidant ) , there was plenty that these two splendidly unlikely friends had in common .			1

@entity3 died from cancer last week at the age of 70
the former model was at the heart of the *controversial* @entity137 scandal
it has been revealed she shared a long friendship with @entity1
the women spent time on holiday together along with their husbands
