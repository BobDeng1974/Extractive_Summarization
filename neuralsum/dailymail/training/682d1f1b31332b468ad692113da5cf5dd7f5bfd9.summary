by @entity0 published : 08:25 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 08:26 est , 14 january 2014 in scenes that would n’t look out of place in a school playground , rare footage has captured a female capuchin throwing stones , whining , and playing a form of kiss chase			1
although this behaviour may seem aggressive , it is actually the female 's attempt to grab the attention of a nearby male			1
each of these attention - seeking moves form part of a larger seduction routine designed to tell the male that the female is ready for mating			1
she starts by shaking the branch of a tree before throwing a stone at him , like the one pictured			1
capuchins are renowned for using stones for digging and cracking nuts and researchers claim their throw is surprisingly accurate female capuchin monkeys do not display any physical indicators that could tell a male they are ready to mate			1
instead , they perform a series of bizarre rituals to grab a male 's attention and seduce him			2
whining calls , pouting and branch shaking are designed to attract males generally			2
once a female selects a male , she will then additionally throw stones at him , and touch him before running away			2
yet this behaviour is still preferable to how males attempt to seduce their mates			0
male capuchins urinate on their hands and rub it over their body , like an aftershave			0
the recording was made during filming for a @entity63 and @entity64 documentary called @entity25			0

they were helped by professor @entity71 from the @entity72 who has spent the last two years studying the social interactions of the monkeys			0
in the clip , the female capuchin is shown shaking a tree branch , while whining and pouting			1
when that does n’t work , and the male continues to ignore her advances , she resorts to flirting with him by throwing a large stone			1

professor @entity106 told the @entity63 that ' unlike other monkeys , female capuchins do not have any physical indicators to show when they are at their most fertile or " proceptive			0
" ' this means they have to make their intentions clear in more direct ways			0
