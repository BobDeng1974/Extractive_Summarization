@entity55 is an anonymous photo sharing site along with a comment board whose greatest strength of anonymity has also become a problem area			1
long leadership : 4chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss @entity64 anime and post photos			1
the image board site soon grew to by much more , and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world leaked : nude photos of @entity71 were posted to 4chan which then circulated the web an anonymous individual sparked some scandal this past august after dumping dozens of naked photographs of female celebrities onto the 4chan online forum			1
hundreds of leaked photos of celebrities followed			2
among those celebrities whose photos were shared were @entity71 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , to name a few			2
photos of @entity87 gymnast @entity86 were also included on the site and it was later discovered that photos of @entity86 were taken while she was underage and therefore qualified as child pornography			1
a murderous confession along with photos of a corpse were also shared on the anonymous board			2

in addition to posting leaked nude images and gruesome murders , 4chan has also been a place for popular memes , celebrity rumors to swirl , and harsh cyber-bullying among other topics			1
created in 2003 by a 15 - year - old high school student from @entity150 , @entity6 , 4chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss @entity64 anime and post photos			1
the image board site soon grew to by much more , and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world			2
the biggest difference between 4chan and other websites however is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously , giving many free reign to do things they would not do otherwise			2
while this has led to the site producing some amusing and funny pranks , many are horrific and have led to the arrest of the person or persons who created them			2
lolcats – the @entity173 obsession with cats actually began back in 2005 when one @entity175 decided to post as a photo of a cat waiting for @entity178			2
it all took off from there			0
rickroll – in 2007 , a fake link to the trailer for the video game @entity185 was posted to the site after the website of the game ’s publisher , @entity182 , crashed			0

” @entity198 – in 2008 members on the site spread a false rumor that @entity198 was dead , causing @entity203 stock prices to plummet a whopping 10 % in one day			0
send @entity204 to @entity205 – @entity204 has long been a target for the site , and in 2010 he wanted fans to tell him where they wanted him to go on his @entity209			0
@entity55 users hacked his site , and the overwhelming winner was @entity205			1
the @entity213 did not ultimately make the trip			0
@entity215 – in what may have been their most vicious attack to date , members of @entity55 began to cyberbully an 11 - year - old girl after claiming she was having a relationship with an older man			1
they posted her address , called her house , and spread false rumors and reports about her and her family			0
the threats got so bad that the young girl was put in police protection at one point			0
@entity232 – in 2012 a @entity55 hacker and white supremacist falsely claimed they had hacked into @entity232 ’s email and @entity237 accounts after his murder , posting emails and photos that were supposed to back up the false claim that @entity232 was a drug addict and dealer			1
cutting for @entity204 – in early 2013 , a member of @entity55 created an elaborate @entity245 hoax in which they urged fans of @entity204 to cut themselves so the pop star would stop smoking weed			2
soon , the hashtags # cutforbieber and # cuttingforbieber amassed numerous photos of fans who claimed to have slashed their wrists and forearms over @entity204 's drug use			0
@entity258 's @entity257 – in 2013 @entity258 , like @entity204 , wanted fans to help her out with her next contest			0

’ the contest was ultimately cancelled			0
celebrity nude leaks – nothing @entity55 has done has had a bigger impact however than the leaking of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities in 2014 , something that eventually led to the @entity276 getting involved			1
victims included a-list stars like @entity71 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 .			0
