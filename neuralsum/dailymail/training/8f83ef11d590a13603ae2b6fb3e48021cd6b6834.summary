@entity142 , 42 , of @entity143 , who runs the world ’s most popular @entity6 website , said : ‘ they keep making all these announcements about what ’s going to happen to her , then it just goes silent and now she ’s just sitting there			0
‘ she is the last of her type – @entity154 built , @entity154 designed , and originally @entity154 crewed			0
