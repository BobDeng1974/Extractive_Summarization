click here to read @entity2 's match report @entity4 and @entity5 player ratings @entity7 's big match analysis there was no hiding place from the giant new @entity11 screens			1
there it all was : incorrect decisions , revealed close up with replays , slow motion with @entity18 quality and booed widely around the stadium			0
the new , almost shadow - free floodlights cast further light on other mistakes by the referee			2
when is a try not a try ? when it ’s shown on scoreboards that look as big as cinema screens for everyone else to see what the referee has missed			2
in football , they are n’t allowed to expose contentious decisions inside the stadium for fear of increasing pressure on the referee or starting a riot of idiots			2
the new giant screens at @entity11 were used for the first time during @entity4 's defeat by @entity5 the screens - each measuring 169sq metres - were hung from the roof behind both posts replays on the big screen cast doubt on @entity50 's try - which was awarded by referee @entity51 the newly installed flood lights at @entity11 are shadow - free and put the spotlight on the referee inside @entity11 , they have a different class of audience and so they showed those moments again and again to a cascade of boos , although the chap from the @entity63 wrote that official @entity51 had ‘ an excellent ’ game in his report			1
i guess he had the advantage of seeing all of the game and did n’t have to queue for his refreshments			0
i missed three minutes at the of the first first half to try to get ahead of the stampede , the entire half time and another five minutes of the second half before i was served			0
a total of 23 minutes for two pints of @entity75 , costing £ 6 each ( in a ' fan cup ' )			0
enough time for a @entity78 chap in the queue to remark : ‘ we could have gone to @entity82 and got this quicker			0
’ @entity4 got off to the best possible start when @entity85 ran in to score his first international try @entity4 fought hard but were beaten by world champions @entity5 by three points referee @entity51 was booed by the crowd when some of his decisions were replayed on the screens @entity5 captain @entity93 with the @entity94 after victory over @entity4 at @entity11 @entity2 ’s match report , published instantly to @entity98 on the final whistle , informed me what i had missed , but when you ’ve paid £ 89 each for two tickets high up in the @entity104 , you are entitled to think you might get to see the whole game for yourself			1
surely , for all their impressive £ 76m revamp at rugby ’s hq , there has to be a way of getting served in less than 23 minutes .			1

world champions @entity5 beat @entity4 *24* - *21* at @entity11
referee @entity51 was booed after awarding a contentious @entity5 try
@entity11 has new screens and floodlights after £ 76m revamp
