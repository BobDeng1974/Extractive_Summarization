by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 08:40 est , 14 january 2014 this building has stood against the elements for more than 170 years - but now nature is reclaiming its place			2
weeds , stems and shoots creep up the @entity9 exterior , and have even made their way inside on the highest levels of the crumbling , derelict property			2
@entity14 is the name by which the building was most recently known , but it was actually constructed as a workhouse for the poor in 1936			1
growth : @entity19 is creeping through the windows of this first - floor corridor desolate : the former hospital site is now full of debris , and plant - life from outside is beginning to creep into the building high climber : these plants have established themselves even on the upper floors of @entity14 's hospital danger : fences surround the building , discouraging others from entering it has stood abandoned for 15 years since the hospital closed after 70 years of service			1
and , thanks to its place in history as one of the buildings spawned by the 19th - century poor laws , it has proved difficult to get rid of			0
though a tide of outrage at the suffering of those who laboured inside - fanned by tales like those in @entity55 's novel @entity56 - closed the workhouses for good , they have a lasting place in history			2
the significance of the building - designed by architect sir @entity62 , who was behind @entity64 's @entity63 and the @entity65 - was reaffirmed last year when the government slapped down an application to remove its listed status			1
outside : vegetation is encroaching on the derelict building , in @entity71 decay : a combination of vegetation ( left ) and the work of graffiti artists ( right ) have helped speed the decline of the building , constructed in the 1830s crumbling : parts of the building 's walls have collapsed , leaving some rooms completely exposed to the elements but inside the former medical centre is a haunting and dangerous sight			1
frequented by the homeless for shelter , its windows are mostly smashed and sharp debris covers the floors			0
little medical equipment remains , except for dust - covered signs and the occasional abandoned bedpan			0
elsewhere the crumbling walls , potentially unstable floors and exposed lift shafts make it an uncomfortable site to visit			0
@entity14 's was converted into a hospital in the 1930s , and continued for almost 70 years until it was closed down and its functions moved elsewhere			1
the land was bought up by developers and other buildings , which are part of the original hospital site , have been demolished and replaced by a @entity107 and a restaurant			0
former developers rochmills had planned to turn the site into retirement homes and office space , but their plans , submitted in 2010 , were withdrawn shortly after			0
@entity114 : signs remain identifying the different areas of the hospital , as well as the occasional medical item such as the pictured bedpan untouched : the dusty sign to the right identifies the @entity123 area of the former hospital dangerous : this staircase , left , leads to potentially unstable upper floors , while lift shafts such as this ( right ) are now exposed through the hospital disused : wallpaper peels from the wall around this abandoned piece of equipment worse for wear : the hospital complex has been abandoned since 1998 planning permissions for the site has now lapsed , which means that the local authority would have to approve any further work before it can take place			1
last year there were attempts by an anonymous applicant to remove the building 's listed status - claiming that it never should have been granted in the first place - which would have made it easier to develop the site			0
but the government , supported by advisory body @entity149 , rejected the bid because of the building 's importance as a former workhouse			0
at the time an @entity149 spokesman told the local paper : ' we â€™re pleased the government has agreed with our recommendation to keep @entity14 in @entity71 on the statutory list			1
' built in 1836 - 7 , it was one of the first generation of @entity163 workhouses , designed by the eminent @entity9 architect @entity62 , and it represents a key moment in changing social attitudes towards the provision made for the poor and destitute			1
' bare : the hospital site has long been stripped of any medical supplies message : the walls still feature instructions to patients and visitors bedding down : the eerie development , formerly a workhouse for the poor , is now used occasionally by homeless people for shelter			2

@entity14 in @entity71 was built as a workhouse in 1836 by the architect who designed @entity63
it was converted to a hospital in the 1930s , but was abandoned in 1998 and has stood abandoned ever since
the @entity191 listed property is now being overrun by *greenery* , and inside is filled with decay and debris
