three and a half years after their debut in the competition , @entity0 are still to fall in love with the @entity4			1
the @entity6 champions have come a long way in a short time			1
manager @entity8 has already won two major trophies			2
prior to him , @entity10 did likewise			0
@entity11 , however , remains unconquered			2
to a degree , it remains unknown territory for the club			2
@entity16 and @entity17 enjoy @entity0 training ahead of facing @entity19 on tuesday night @entity0 midfielder @entity16 ( left ) shares a joke with manager @entity8 on monday the @entity0 squad jog during their warm - up in training on monday in @entity24 manager @entity8 ( right ) will hope new striker @entity17 ( left ) is sharp if called upon on tuesday in the boardroom at the @entity28 , they do not panic about @entity0 ’s modest record outside the domestic game			1
winning the @entity4 remains important for the club ’s owners but there is no great fuss made about a record that shows just one foray beyond the group stages			1
what is important , however , is to sense progress			0
given the way @entity0 played during much of this season ’s group section , they will perhaps be glad to be in the last 16 at all			1
it is clear , therefore , that something of a breakthrough performance is required against @entity19 on tuesday night if questions are not to be raised about the @entity0 template in @entity11			1
the whole @entity0 squad is put through their paces at their training complex on monday @entity52 ( right ) looks confused as @entity53 ( left ) looks on during @entity0 training @entity55 ( centre ) puts in a tackle on @entity0 's @entity58 at the @entity28 in november 2012 @entity59 ( centre ) shoots at goal during @entity0 's @entity4 match against @entity63 in 2013 @entity64 chips in a fine goal during @entity19 's 4 - 1 aggregate victory over @entity0 last season @entity64 ( right ) falls to the ground under pressure from @entity70 at the @entity28 last year @entity0 's @entity58 , @entity70 and @entity71 ca n't hide their frustration against @entity19 last season asked about the subject , the in - form @entity16 nodded to the disparity between the club ’s football at home and in @entity11			1
he agreed when it was put to him that even the club ’s supporters have not yet fully embraced the @entity4			1
‘ @entity82 , i think that ’s right , ’ said @entity16			0
‘ we have had lot of success in the @entity87 in the last years and the fans are really passionate about it			2
‘ but in the @entity4 we need to create our history to have this special relationship with the fans in that competition , too			2
‘ a game like @entity19 can be a big step for us and the fans in the competition			2
’ @entity97 celebrates his strike as @entity99 cruised past @entity99 5 - 0 at the @entity28 on saturday @entity59 sprints away in celebration after scoring a vital goal against @entity102 in november a year ago , @entity0 ’s circumstances were similar			1
same opposition , same stage of the competition , same sense of uncertainty			0
this season , the club ’s football in @entity11 has been little better than before			1
a comeback at home against @entity102 was gutsy , as was a subsequent win in @entity115 , but there has been little conviction and certainly no consistency			0
@entity8 must only hope a winter programme that has seen his team play slightly fewer games than last season — city are out of both domestic cup competitions — can help ahead of the home game on tuesday against a team that lost for the first time in 12 games at the weekend			1
city star @entity16 wants the fans to connect with the @entity4 ad inspire the team to glory ‘ i do n’t think that last year we changed our style against @entity19 or showed them too much respect , ’ reflected @entity8 on a tie the @entity135 team won 4 - 1 on aggregate			1
‘ maybe we just could n’t do what we tried to do			0
’ ‘ we ’d played 19 games in two months so we tried to play with our style another way			0
we were happy with the way we played in that game , we did n’t just defend all game			0
we tried to contain @entity19 but also tried to attack and we could n’t do it			2
i think that this year we are going to try to do what we want to do			0
’ if that appeared a slightly contradictory message from the @entity151 then it is not unusual			0
his attitude before games of this magnitude always seems to involve leaving as much as possible to interpretation			0
@entity157 offers a wave to the crowd after scoring @entity0 's fourth during the emphatic 5 - 0 win over @entity99 @entity8 hopes his side can reverse the results from the last 16 4 - 1 aggregate loss to @entity19 last year @entity8 ’s general theme on monday was clear , however			1
he knows his team need to take a lead to the @entity168 in mid-march and , if they can not do that , they need to take a goal			0
a year ago they managed neither and the second leg in @entity135 was something of a non-event			0
‘ before their last game , @entity19 won 11 games in a row , ’ added @entity8			1
‘ in this match we ’ll see the real @entity19			2
i said last week that it was very important to focus our minds on the @entity99 game and not on tuesday			0
‘ maybe @entity19 did n’t do the same and thought they were just going to beat @entity184			2
it ’s always important for me to try and go into these games and win the game but also win the previous one			0
@entity189 keeps his eye on the ball as he attempts a volley during @entity19 training at the @entity28 ‘ having scored five goals at home against @entity99 is going to give us big confidence for taking on a team like @entity19 , who will try to score goals			1
the most important thing is to win the game without conceding goals at home			0
‘ in terms of possession of the ball , there are two things we have to think about			0
the first is we have got to try and get the ball back as quickly as we can and be very intense because they have very gifted , technical players			0
‘ the second thing — and it ’s just as important — is that when we have the ball we ca n’t give it way cheaply			0
we have got to have very good concentration for 90 , 95 minutes of the game			0
’ @entity17 ( left ) , @entity16 ( centre ) and @entity218 ( right ) are put through their paces in training @entity221 shares a joke with @entity64 as @entity19 trained on the @entity28 pitch on monday night @entity0 will be without the suspended @entity58 on tuesday evening but that may be a blessing			1
for all his influence in the @entity87 , the @entity227 ’s suspect discipline can be a liability in @entity11			1
instead @entity8 will perhaps field the @entity231 duo @entity232 and @entity233 as defensive midfield shields in a bit to prevent the @entity19 forwards flooding on to @entity0 ’s back four as easily as they did a year ago			1
it is another big @entity28 occasion but in order to make it truly memorable , @entity0 really need to win .			1

@entity0 welcome @entity240 club @entity19 to the @entity28 on tuesday
the @entity4 last 16 first - leg sees @entity189 return to @entity6
@entity87 champions have *struggled* to perform well in @entity11
@entity8 's side have progressed to the last 16 just once before
