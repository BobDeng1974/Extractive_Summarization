what he did n't realize at the time though , was that her cat liked to hide in the box spring			1
@entity15 noticed @entity10 was missing shortly after seeing the box spring off to its new owner , who took it more than six miles down the road to an area near the @entity48 outside @entity49 , @entity4			1
the couple searched the home of the person who bought the box spring to no @entity53 was n't there			2
distance : the cat was located near the @entity48 , which is about six miles from the apartment building where @entity33 lived with the cat from there , the couple started a massive canvassing campaign , covering their town in missing cat posters and searching for the feline on foot			2

but when they came back on saturday they got a pleasant surprise			0
a tipster called @entity15 after spotting a cat that looked like @entity10 near the @entity48			0
on saturday , the couple set up a live trap which included sardines and clothing from @entity2 ' home			2
beloved : the couple received hundreds of calls with possible spottings of @entity10 during the 10 days the cat was missing after just an hour and a half , @entity33 and a friend returned to the trap and found @entity10 inside - albeit a little worse for wear			1
