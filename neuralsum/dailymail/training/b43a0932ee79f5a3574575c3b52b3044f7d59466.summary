by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 12 june 2013 ambitious : @entity1 , 29 , is setting off on the 103 - mile swim today an @entity3 woman is attempting to become the first person to swim from @entity5 to @entity6 without a shark cage			1
@entity1 , 29 , is setting off on the 103 - mile ( 166 - km ) swim today			1
the treacherous body of water known as the @entity10 is the @entity11 for marathon swimmers and has been conquered only once , by @entity13 , also @entity3 , who used a protective cage at age 22 during her 1997 swim that glided on ocean currents and enabled her to make the journey in just 25 hours			0
since 2011 , four unsuccessful , uncaged swims have been attempted , three by @entity22 @entity21 and one by @entity3 @entity23 , and in all , 20 people have tried and failed , @entity1 said in a press conference on tuesday at the @entity25 west of @entity26			1
' it 's the hardest marathon swim in the entire world , ' the blond , well - tanned 28 - year - old told reporters			1
' this is like winning a @entity32 in soccer or getting a world record and a gold medal at the @entity36 , but it 's possibly harder because no one has been able to do it , ' said @entity1 , who works as a first aid trainer in @entity41			2
@entity1 trains 50 weeks a year and has a record of accomplishment that includes two double crossings of the @entity45			2
she 'll use so - called @entity45 marathon rules , meaning she ca n't touch the boats that will accompany her during what she estimates will be a 60 - hour journey , hopefully ending on the shores of @entity51 , @entity6			0
she and her husband , @entity76 , did a thorough study of past failed attempts to see what could be done differently			0
based on their findings , they turned to science to increase the chance of success			0
since 2011 , four unsuccessful , uncaged swims have been attempted , three by @entity22 @entity21 , pictured attempt : @entity23 had to end her effort to become the first woman to swim unassisted from @entity5 to the @entity89 because of an unusually strong and dangerous current record : it has been conquered only once , by @entity13 , who used a protective cage at age 22 during her 1997 swim that glided on ocean currents the swim is being attempted now because the box jelly fish , a particularly venomous species that has stung other swimmers , are less numerous in the @entity10 this time of year			1
the moon is also in a new phase , meaning there is not much of it and therefore little moonlight , an abundance of which attracts jellyfish to the surface , where the swimmers are			0
like past swimmers , @entity1 will be surrounded by an underwater electromagnetic field to keep sharks away			1
her support crew of 50 people includes a team of @entity22 - based scientists , all experts on the @entity74 , to monitor the current and its constant changes as it flows toward the @entity120			1
they will create computer models to help the crew of the @entity124 , the 44 - foot ( 13 - meter ) catamaran that will accompany @entity1 , navigate around pitfalls that have doomed prior swims			2
' we can foresee 10 , 20 , 30 kilometers ahead if there 's anything we can avoid , ' @entity1 said			0
" if we can slightly change our course , we 're less likely to get picked up by an eddy of the @entity74 and pushed in the wrong direction			0
' she said she also wants to use the swim to raise money for cancer research and cancer victims - donations can be made on her website @entity141 - and to encourage better relations between the @entity22 and @entity5 , bitter ideological foes the past half century despite their geographical nearness .			0
