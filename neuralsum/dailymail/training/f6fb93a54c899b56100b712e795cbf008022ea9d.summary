neighbours in @entity45 , @entity46 , queued up to give evidence against him at the hearing			0
@entity49 , 63 , told @entity51 magistrates : ‘ it ’s a living nightmare for all the people who have struggled to buy a house in what was a nice cul de sac			1

' i ’m two doors away and i can hear it			0

’ @entity75 , who lives next door to @entity2 , approached the police and council after suffering ‘ many ’ sleepless nights			1

‘ it got to the point where i had to go and stay with friends so that i could guarantee getting some sleep			0
’ a third neighbour , @entity88 , a financial adviser , said : ‘ it ’s extremely disturbing			2
it ’s the noise disruption , the driving and the shouting			0
' there have been incidents of fighting in the driveway			0
’ splashed the cash : @entity2 bought his home for £ 185,000 in august 2011 and also owns a buy - to - let property for around £ 180,000			1
he has blown most of the remainder of the winnings @entity104 , for @entity103 council , told the court that although @entity2 ’s behaviour had improved in the weeks leading up to the hearing an asbo was necessary to prevent further problems			2
